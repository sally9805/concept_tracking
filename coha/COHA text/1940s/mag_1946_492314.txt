We Captured Hermann Goering By CAPT . HAROLD L. BOND The revealing , blow-by-blow story of how the Nazis ' fleshy Reichsmarshal reacted to capture  --  before he had a chance to get his guard up and put on a rehearsed show for the world . N a morning early in May , 1945 , the 36th Infantry Division Command Post was located in a Nazi school building at Kufstein , Austria . For the past few days we had been pushing the Germans back across Southern Germany and now they were retreating from the foothills of the Austrian Alps to the higher mountains in the south . We had taken a great many prisoners in the last days of the war , so no one was surprised to see a German vehicle draped with white flags drive up in front of the command post . But the German major who got out was not surrendering . He wanted to see the division commander , and said he bad been sent by Hermann Goering . When presented to Major General Dahlquist , who was commanding the 36th Division @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under orders to contact the American commander of the sector and arrange for the surrender of Reichsmarshal Goering . After careful questioning and after the envoy 's papers had been thoroughly examined , General Dahl-quiet concluded that the major probably was telling the truth . The major proposed to lead some Americans back through the lines to a castle two valleys away . There the Americans would meet Goering and bring the Nazi kingpin back to our side of the war  --  if we could believe the major . I was working in my room when word came that the assistant division commander , Brigadier General Stack , wanted me . " Bond , " he said , " go put on your surrender uniform . We 're going out to get Goering . " In the last few days our division had captured many highly placed Nazis , among them Von Rendstedt . We were inclined to believe almost anything , with our fingers crossed . But if someone had told* me we were going after Hitler himself , I could n't have been more startled . I put on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were going to get the bemedaled Hermann , a few decorations on our own uniforms would n't be inappropriate . General Stack told me our mission was to bring Goering back to the command post alive . It was only because we wanted the No. 2 Nazi alive that we were being sent into enemy territory to take possession . Into the German Lines W E left at 1000 hours , taking a platoon of the 30th Cavalry Reconnaissance Troop , mounted in t heir lightly armored reconnaissance cars and jeeps . We were all armed ; the war was still on and we had no idea what we would get into . Goering 's messenger led the caravan in his touring car and we followed in the general 's sedan , with the reconnaissance platoon behind . A few minutes brought us to the town of Kitzbiihel . In peacetime this had been a fashionable winter resort . Now it was the last outpost of American lines . Two sentries stationed on the far side of town looked at us as if to disclaim responsibility for a foolhardy venture . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so you might as well go ahead , " their expression seemed to say , " hut do n't blame us if you get into trouble . " Those were the last Americans we saw that long , puzzling , anxious day . We drove east up a rich Alpine valley . The sun was shining brilliantly on snow-covered mountains towering above us . The snow must have been melting rapidly . The river we followed on the valley floor was a rushing torrent . Except for nature 's sounds , everything was exceedingly quiet . We heard no shooting anywhere as we passed across that unde fined area sometimes known as no man 's land . Near the end of the valley , where the road began to rise , we came upon the first German troops . A machine gun , carefully camouflaged , was pointing down the road directly at us . There seemed a fair chance that this could be the end of the line for us . We had seen Germans demonstrate a complete disregard for the white flag of truce which still adorned the major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mine had been seriously wounded when SS troops opened fire as he tried to rescue a wounded man under such a flag . But we kept going as the German major led . Just before we reached the gun emplacement , a crew of Germans jumped up and saluted smartly . We began to run into German sentries stationed at intervals along the road , but each snapped to atten tion and saluted . They gave the Heil Hitler salute , which we did not return . Our Luftwaffe major seemed to have made good arrangements . We had no trouble whatsoever and passed through the lines  --  perhaps one of the most difficult jobs when a war is in progress  --  without once being stopped . At the top of the snow-covered pass , we crossed over into what is certainly one of the most beautifull valleys in the world . We were high among the giant white peaks and as far as we could see there was one huge mountain range after another . Many thousand feet below us stretched a green valley of small farms making a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an appropriate setting for the German army and its leaders to stage the last act of their Glitterddmmerung . We rode into the valley over a twisting road , and after having traveled thirty kilometers inside enemy territory , we came to a castle . It was an old building standing on a little rise of ground and overlooking a gorgeous lake . A high ivy-covered wall left only the top story visible from the road . This was the rendezvous , but Goering was not there . We would have to wait a little , our guide told us , because the Reichsmarshal was traveling over back roads in an effort to keep this trip as much of a secret as possible . That morning Goering had left a small town near Berchtesgaden where he had been living since the bombing of Hitler 's mountain hideout . That was definite , the major said . But there had been no word from Goering since . We deployed our one platoon of reconnaissance troops around the castle for our own security and went inside . It was not a large building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goering . It had been many years , apparently , since anyone had lived here . The furniture was covered with sheets , the paintings had been taken from the walls , all the shades were drawn , and there was a musty smell mixed with the sharp odor of camphor . The German major led the way and opened the windows in what must have been the dining room . We hauled the sheets from several chairs and a table , and made ourselves comfortable . The major excused himself , saying he was going to try to locate Goering by telephoning military installations at various towns through which the marshal would travel . While we waited alone in the dusk of this deserted dining room , a servant appeared through one of the many doors and asked if we would like some wine . He was an old man and spoke no English , but " Wein " is one of the words a soldier learns quickly , and I knew enough German to say " Jo ! " The wine he brought was superlative , which was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cellars all over Europe . We ordered something to eat . The old man nodded and disappeared silently through another of the many doors . Our interpreter joined us  --  a young sergeant from the division G-2 section  --  and the three of us at there drinking excellent wine and wondering what we were in for . We did n't talk much . There was n't much to say . Actually , our position was rather uncertain . We were at least thirty kilometers from our own lines , with the war still in progress . We were drinking good wine in a strange , semideserted castle in the middle of the German army . We had come on the unsupported word of one enemy officer . General Stack had been fighting Germans with the 36th Division for more than a year and a half in Italy , France and Germany . So had I. I had fought as an infantry platoon leader against the Hermann Goering Division at Cassino , Italy , and learned never to trust anyone who had anything whatsoever to do with Goering . Being behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not necessarily enjoyable as far as I was concerned . The afternoon dragged on and still the major did not return . Neither did the servant who was seeing about our lunch . We knew German communications were in a confused state . It was logical that the major might have trouble phoning . But we began to wonder if this was a trap  --  a German trick to liquidate a high-ranking American officer . The three of us sat there smoking . We went through one package of cigarettes and walked down to the car for more . We came back . And now the vanishing servant appeared with lunch . It was belated , but the food was excellent and there was plenty . It was 1500 hours as we finished our meal  --  three in the afternoon , and no Goering . But our missing major showed up . One look at his face told us he was worried . The fact that he showed concern was reassuring . It seemed to indicate that he probably was honest . He had not been able to get through to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being worried lest Goering was lost , he was worried lest Goering had been waylaid . He told us Goering was in considerable danger . SS troops had received orders signed by Hitler directing them to kill Goering , the major said , but their commander did not believe the orders could be authentic . He sent for confirmation , meanwhile preparing to carry out the order if confirmed . The aide went on to say that a company of Luftwaffe soldiers was prepared to defend Marshal Goering with their lives , while the company of SS troops was equally determined to carry out their orders or die . The Twilight of the Gods I all sounds fantastic now , but with Germany in 1 chaos , it was entirely plausible that afternoon in the castle . We had a fleeting vision of a pitched battle between fanatics of the SS and fanatics of the Luftwaffe , with us in the middle . Another possibility worried the major . German morale was so low that he feared a group of embittered soldiers might have attacked Goering 's car on the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the melancholy major excused himself and went back to telephone again . While we waited , one of our guards brought in two German officers . One was a colonel , the other a major . Their insignia identified the pair as belonging to the Florian Geyer Division . That was one of the divisions of the most hated of all German tongs , Heinrich Himmler 's SS . The major was a hatchet-faced thug and the colonel was quite obviously a pervert . Both were a little bit drunk , and wanted to talk . They were feeling very sorry for themselves and for Germany . Now that the war was almost over , they were nervous about their SS connections and wanted to know what would happen to people in their shoes . They tried hard to pretend they had done nothing to merit punishment , but guilt was written all over their faces . The main theme of their conversation was that we should join the " glorious German army " in defeating the Russians . To listen was like listening to a phonograph record of Mein Kampf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Finally , the general grew too angry to stand any more , and ordered them out of the room . We learned later that these two and a few others were all that was left of the Florian Geyer Division , which had been chewed to pieces on the Russian front . The colonel 's brother , we were told , was one of Goering 's arch enemies . Our missing major reappeared at last with news . He had located Goering . The master of the Luftwaffe was on his way , but would not arrive for several hours . The major had time now to explain in a little more detail why Goering had got in touch with the Americans and arranged to give himself up . Goering was terribly afraid of falling into the hands of the Russians and of having his family captured by the Russians . But he was afraid of his own people , too . Above all , he wanted protection for his family , the aide explained , and , looking over the choices , decided that he had better take his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long , uneasy and irritating . We were getting increasingly impatient . The general was getting annoyed at having to wait so long . Finally , at about five P.M. , he told Goering 's aide that he would wait no more . We would go out and get the marshal on ( Continued. , , , rage GO ) // ( Confirmed from Pug , . 581 famed , $36,000-a-year aity editor of Hearst 's Journal-American . Spiro tried o advise Sam to tone down a bit in voice and manner . Sam eyed him benignly . " Listen , " he said , " you stick to your headlines . I know what . I 'm doing . Let me do my business my way . " The implicaticm taken from this is that his loudness and toughness were largely an act to help him in his role of front man for the soft-spoken boys . Subway Sam 's carefully nurtured reputation for toughness helped put him in an embarrassing position when , on the evening of February 19 , 1937 , a labor leader named R. Norman Redwood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . According to County Prosecutor John J. Breslin later , the deed was done by " four or five hired killers , who probably did the whole job for $500 . " Such killings were not rare in the turbulent labor wars in New York during that period , and almost invariably the official investigations cracked up against a wall of anonymity . In this case , however , Breslin told the press within a couple of hours that he wanted to question Samuel R. Rosoff . Redwood had been battling two rival labor leaders , Joe Fay and Jimmy Bove , who , eight years later , in 1945 , were sentenced to long prison terms for labor racketeering . Accusing them of lining their own pockets with graft from employers instead of fighting for increases in the pay envelopes of their followers , Redwood had been raiding Fay and Bove 's unions . In a show of strength , he called a strike of 1200 Rosoff workers on a sewer project and a 6th Avenue Subway job . If Redwood won , he would be on his way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Subway Sam was caught in the middle of this brawl . It was in the lean days for big construction jobs , and if the strike threw him too far behind schedule , he might go broke again . Breslin said he wanted to question Rosoff because an aide of Redwood 's had made a statement to him accusing Rosoff of threatening Redwood during a stormy conference two weeks prior to the killing . The aide said that Rosoff " jumped up and rushed across the room at Redwood , shook his hands under Redwood 's nose , gave him a shove and said , ' If this strike is called , I will have you killed . . . . Remember , Redwood , if you do anything like that , you are a dead man . You can tell that to the police . Tell them if you want to ! ' " Rosoff was in an Atlantic City hotel bar when , at one A.M. after the shooting , a telephone call from a New York newspaper informed him that Breslin WE CAPTURED HERMANN GOERING the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accidents , fights or just plain getting lost to leave things to chance any longer . Our mission was to get Goering alive , if at all possible , and we wanted to get our hands on him . We left the reconnaissance platoon at the castle to maintain guard and prevent any Germans from moving in . The castle would he big enough to keep Goering and whomever he might have with him , and we would have them all in one building . The general , Goering 's aide and the interpreter went first in the sedan . I followed in a jeep with a wanted him . He started for New York almost immediately . He went there in a remarkably roundabout way . The shortest way was up the length of New Jersey via the fast Shore Highway . But Rosoff sped west across New Jersey to Philadelphia , in a car driven by the bodyguard of Enoch L. Johnson , than Republican boss of Atlantic City . This enabled Rosoff to avoid going through Bergen County on his way to New York , and got him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philadelphia he hired a taxicab . The shortest and best route from Philadelphia to New York is over Route No. 1 , which flows splendidly through New Jersey . Instead , the taxi made an elaborately roundabout trip , via Stroudsburg , Permsylvania , avoiding New Jersey soil . Ensconced in his New York apartment , Subway Sam declined Breslin 's urgings that he come over to Bergen County for questioning . His chauffeur bodyguard , who did go over to talk to the authorities , was clapped into jail without bail for a period . " How do I know they wo n't do the same thing to me ? " Rosoff demanded of a roomful of newspaper reporters who sat sipping his Scotch . " They might put Me in the jug and keep me there for days and weeks . I 'm not going to sit in the jug for anybody . If they want to question me , let them come over here and do it . " He denied categorically that he had ( a ) anything to do with the killing , ( b ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarreled with Redwood . He cited the fact that he and Redwood had drinks together the day before the murder , and pointed to a newspaper photograph showing Redwood and himself in a friendly pose after the alleged threats . The case was a nine-day sensation , but nothing much more came of it . Breslin caused a material-witness wardriver , one rifleman and a light machine gun . This gun , mounted on the dashboard in front of my seat , plus one rifle and three pistols , was the total armament of our task force . Our road led through a deep gorge for several miles and then came to a fairly large town . Few civilians were on the streets , but there were many soldiers in ragged but familiar uniforms  --  British and American . The German major stopped to telephone again . While we waited , we were surrounded by the soldiers , who turned out to be prisoners from a large PW camp outside the town . Their guards had gone of and left the prison camp open that morning , and the prisoners were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Typhus had broken out , in one of the camps , and most of them were rant to be issued against Rosoff , but this was not of sufficient legal weight to force extradition from New York to New Jersey . He did not seek a grand-jury indictment , which would have forced Rosoff to come . Breslin told reporters that though he felt Rosoff had some knowledge pertinent to the investigation , he did not have sufficient evidence for an indictment . The case remains unsolved to this day . After this affair , Subway Sam dropped from the public eye and prints for several years . He began to emerge again when , early in the war , he won a $45,705,000 contract to start building a third set of locks for the Panama Canal from one end , while Henry Kaiser started from the other . A change in the war picture caused the project to be held up after about 10 per cent of the work was done . Currently , Subway Sam is completing an $11,000,000 tunnel for an irrigation project in the state of Puebla @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $50,000,000 industrial development in Northwestern Mexico . He lives in a three-room suite in the flashy Reforma Hotel in Mexico City , and in his spare time stages bull fights and prize fights for charity , and plays a leading role in Mexico City 's frenetic night life . But he maintains are apartment in the Navarro Hotel , 112 Central Park South , one of the most fashionable and expensive sections of New York , and dreams of a comeback in the New York arena . On a visit recently to the scene of his greatest exploits , Mr. Rosoff gave the following formula for success : " A young man should n't look at the failures , and he must fear no man , no matter how big . And he must work . Sitting around is no good . " Or , as Horatio Alger put it , more succinctly , in one of his titles : Strive and Succeed . worried about that , but the sight of our little party was good medicine .

When we told them that the war would be over at midnight that night , a tre-mendous cheer went up that was al-most deafening . Most of them were British soldiers who had been captured in the fall of Greece . We were the first Allied soldiers they had seen for years . I offered them cigarettes . Their pale faces lighted up at the sight of the package , but they were too polite to take any until I insisted . They wanted to know what they should do , now that the Americans had arrived .
