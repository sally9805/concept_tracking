" Clear the way for those rabbis . " the stationmaster shouted . The 500 orthodox Jewish leaders , most of them with shrub-shaped beards , many in silky cloaks with thick velvet collars , filed silently through the hurly-burly of Washington 's Union Station . Marching off to the Capitol , they presented to Vice President Henry Wallace and a group of Congressional leaders a seven-point petition . <P> Out stuck request No. 6 : " To open immediately ... the doors of Palestine , the Holy Land of our forefathers which was given to Israel for eternal heritage by the Lord , blessed be His name , with oath and covenant . " The Vice President , his voice low , squirmed through a diplomatically minimum answer and the rabbis took trolley cars to the Lincoln Memorial . Across the Mall rolled the Star-Spangled Banner , chanted in the strange , almost sobbing intonation of Hebrew . Then the rabbis faded out of sight and out of mind . <P> Princes and Palestine . Few days before , two main foes of the main Jewish idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given the full red-carpet treatment . The foes : Prince Feisal , Foreign Minister to Saudi Arabia 's wily Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud , and younger brother Prince Khalid . The grave , observant Arab Princes , ostensibly here to study " Southwest irrigation projects , " thus far seemed to be spending a great deal more time with diplomatic bigwigs than in inspecting irrigation ditches . <P> Oil &; Empire . Next coincidence of the week was the news leak that the U.S. was dickering to buy a piece of Arabia 's fabulous oil resources . <P> Since 1933 the California Arabian Standard Oil Co. ( owned 50-50 by Standard Oil Co. of California and Texas Co. ) has been leasing concessions from Ibn Saud until today it controls an area 60% larger than California ( 254,000 sq . mi. ) , including all the promising fields . Now the U.S. Government itself is negotiating with California Arabian Standard and presumably with Ibn Saud 's representatives for direct participation in the oil exploitation . This , if it went through , would be historic - for the first time in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a speculative oil magnate on foreign soil . Nor could New Deal " anti-imperialists " readily complain , for this was a pet project of oilman Harold L. Ickes . <P> Whether the oil deal was imperialism or no , it would bring problems with it : when the U.S. grasps for Arabian oil it also grasps for the Palestine problem , Ibn Saud , Moslems , rabbis and all .
