One of the Chosen A Story by Hortense Calisher T HE night before the fall reunion of his college class , Spanner had come home a little ashamed of his easy acceptance of the prodding special invitation over the phone that day from Banks , a man whose face he could not even remember . For years he had ignored the printed notices that came to him now and then , even though he lived in the city where the college was , but this time , Banks had said , there was to be a private conclave of all the members of the crew who had won the regatta for the college over twenty years before . Half reluctant to include himself in the picture of the old grads redundantly deploying the terrain of dead triumphs , he had found himself saying that he would come . He had been coxswain of that crew . Thinking it over idly in bed later on , in those random images just before sleep , which carried with them unexpected prickings of realization that lay just below the surface of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the members of the crew , but on all those odd ones , the campus characters who had existed , hardly acknowledged , on the penumbra of his own sunlit , multiform activities of those days . Why should lie now think suddenly of De Jong , the spastic , who jerking and shambling his way one day into the office of the college literary magazine of which he , Spanner , had been a staff member , had thrust upon the group there a sheaf of manuscript , and gargling incomprehensibly , had left before their gauche heartiness could detain him ? The sheaf had contained a group of poems clearly derivative from the unfashionable Housman , and therefore unusable , but marked by a discipline of language , a limpidity , almost a purity of organization , as if in them De Jong had tried to repudiate his disjointed idiot face , the coarse clayey skin , the wide slobbering mouth , thickened with effort . They had avoided discussing him , until Black , the psychology student , had remarked , with his clinician 's air , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , way at the top , you know , in one of those high gallery seats . My God  --  there he was  --  twitching away at some lecture of his own  --  oblivious ! " One of the others had sniggered nervously . The talk had passed on , and later that year , because of a lack of copy , one of the poems had been printed after all . He thought now , with a belated guilt , of the grim separation that must have been De Jong 's , and whether there would have been anything that the rest of them , if less swaddled with their own crude successes , could have done . He 'd never heard the man mentioned again , or seen a reference to him in the alumni magazine . Why now , in this context , should he remember George Shipley , the Negro basketball star of their era , certainly handsome enough , with straight clipped features so completely lacking the prognathous bulges commonly associated with his race that this , no doubt , had had some effect on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , quiet , he had often sat near Spanner in the rotunda of the law library ; Spanner had heard that he was a professor of law now in one of the good southern colleges for Negroes . Why , burning now with something like shame , should he remember him at the dances to which he brought always the same prim-faced mulatto girl ; why should he see him , wide shoulders bent in the d  --  gag ? dance fashion of that day , black features impassive , slowly circling with the girl , always in a small radius of their own ? Spanner was fully awake now , and raised up on his elbow , his eyes gradually following the familiar outlines of the furniture as they grew more perceptible in the darkness , he forced himself to probe in the archives of recall for others who , like Shipley , like De Jong , seemed bound together in his memory only by the mark of that rejection by the group , which now , in pitying retrospect , it seemed to him , had he then been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some friendly overture , might have partially repaired . There was the Burmese princeling who had lived at International House , who had treated a group of them to several awkwardly accepted dinners at Oriental restaurants of his choosing , whose foreignness and wealth had at first had a certain cachet , but from whom they had shortly retreated in ridicule , in gruff embarrassment at the hand , sliding as silk , the emotional waver of the voice . At that , they had never been sure that he was really . . that it had not been just a form of Eastern cajolery , or a misbegotten sense of acceptance which had elicited the moist look , the over-heated hand . Afterward , when they had met him on campus in a few curt scenes of misshapen talk in which it was evident that cameraderie had flown , his gestures had been restrained enough , Lord knows , his eyes sufficiently flat and dull , with reserve enough to satisfy the most conventional of them . Of course , there had been that group of those others , pariahs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restaurant , the Cosmos , through the door of which they sometimes glanced out at you with the hauteur of tropical birds in a zoo , jangling consciously into conversation as you passed , with their tense , dulcet exuberance . Toleration of these had been more than one could expect of boys suffused with their own raw reactions to adulthood , which they covered up with a passionate adherence to the norm , with apprehensive jeerings at the un-averagein its lightest forms , so that even displaying too good , too undulate a French accent , in class , was likely to incur for one the horselaugh from behind . But could they have helped , with some small glow of receptivity , young Schwiller , that model young German from the cleanly-swabbed villa in North Jersey , with too little money , background , or ability  --  too little of everything except a straining unhumorous will to belong  --  who , after some covert abortive incident on a group camping trip , had hanged himself to a tree ? Ah well , Spanner thought , fumbling in the dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ momentary absorption with the ordinary ? these had been the extreme cases . But what of the others , less vividly obvious to memory because they had been more usual , or because they had perhaps already achieved their secret dikes of resignation ? He remembered , for instance , all the little Jewish boys , with their over-expressive eyes , their thickets of hair whose Egyptian luxuriousness no barber could tame , and most revelatory of all , the forced vying , the self-conscious crackle of their conversation . As a Jew himself , he had been helped , he knew , by his fair-skinned , freckled , almost " mick " exterior , by the generations of serene cosmopolitan living that were evident , implicit in the atmosphere of his family 's sprawling apartment on the park , and frankly , he supposed , by the unrevealing name of Spanner , which his great-grandfather had brought over from England , and had come by honestly , as far as the family knew . His family had belonged among those lucky Jews , less rare than was commonly realized , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , much less in any of its harsher forms . Still , despite this , it had been unusual , he knew , to remain so untouched , so free from apprehension of the lurking innuendo , the consciousness of schism  --  for in addition to his race , he had carried too , that dark bruise of intellectuality , the bearers of which the group flings ever into the periphery , if it can . That was where the luck he had had in being coxswain had come in . Because of it , although he had done welI , almost brilliantly in his law classes , all his possibly troublesome differences had remained hidden , inconspicuous under the brash intimacy of the training session , under the hearty accolade of his name on the sporting page  --  because of it he had been hail fellow in the boat house and on the campus  --  he had been their gallant " little guy . " So , he thought , he had ridden through it all in a trance of security which , he realized now , had been given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if he and the others had not been so insensible of it , had been the hurts , the twistings , that might have been allayed . The image of the spastic crossed before him again , a distortion to the extreme of that singularity from which many others must have suffered less visibly , from which he himself had been accountably , blessedly safe . He lay back again , and turning , blotted his face against the dispassionate pillow and slept . T HE next morning he awoke late . It was Saturday . Taking his coffee at the dining-room table deserted by his wife and children some hours before , he was half-annoyed at the emotionalism of the previous night . " Who the hell do I think I am  --  Tolstoy ? " he thought , wincing . Rejecting the unwonted self-analysis that had preceded sleep , he finished his coffee offhandedly , master of himself once more . He got the car out of the garage and swung slowly down the parkway , thinking that if he delayed his arrival until well after twelve he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approached the college-dominated midtown neighborhood , idling the car slowly along , he passed some of the brownstone houses , shoddier now with the indefinable sag of the rooming house , which had been the glossier fraternity houses of his day . He had heard that many of them , even the wealthier ones which had survived depression times , subsidized to plush draperies and pine paneling by some well-heeled brother , had gone down finally during the war years just past , when the college had become a training center for the Navy . Then , he supposed , those accelerated waves of young men passing through , had not only not had time for such amenities , but , trapped together in a more urgent unity , had had no need for the more superficial paradings of Brotherhood . Although he had had his fair share of indiscriminate rushing during his freshman year , he himself had had no particular desire to join a house , comfortably ensconced , as he had been , in his family 's nearby home , alreadysated with the herded confinement of prep school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had joined the magazine , and it was evident that he would have a place on the varsity crew , the best Jewish fraternity had been very pressing , then annoyed at his tepid refusal , and there had been overtures from one or two of the Christian fraternities whose social position was so solid that they could afford , now and then , to ignore the dividing lines in favor of a man whose campus prominence or money would add lustre to the house , but by this time he had already been focusing on his law career . Still , he thought now , he had always had the comfortable sense of acceptance ; he had , for instance , never felt that deep racial unease with the Gentile to which his most apparently assimilated Jewish friends sometimes confessed . To be free from the tortuous doubt , the thin-skinned expectancy of slight  --  it had helped . He had been lucky . In front of one of the brownstones not too far from Jefferson Hall , the old residence hall in one of whose rooms the luncheon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ park the car , and got out . He had n't been near here in years ; his life was a well-conducted bee-line from suburb to downtown office , and most of his associations were on the East Side anyway . He walked past the familiar architectural hodgepodge of the buildings , noting with pleasure that the rough red cobbles of the walks had been preserved , glancing with disapproval at the new library which had been begun in his time , on the field where they used to play tennis . Half utilitarian , but with reticent touches of bastard Greek on its lean flat facade , it stretched out , two-dimensional and unassimilable , a compromise of tastes which had led to none . The vulgarization of taste in a place which should have been a repository of the best still had power to shock him ; he was pleased at having retained this na  --  vet ? , this latent souvenir of youth . Around him and past him , male and female , hurrying or sauntering , or enthusiastically standing still , was that year 's crop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college had not yet vulgarized  --  the look of horizons that were sure , boundaries that were limitless  --  the look of the unreconciled . Already , he twitted himself , he was developing the spots of the returning alumnus . The secret conviction that inwardly , outer decay to the contrary , one had preserved a personal ebullience better than most , the benignant surveying glance with its flavor of " si la jeunesse savair  --  he had them all . Smiling to himself he turned in at the doorway of Jefferson Hall . and making another turn to the reception room on the right , met the slightly worn facsimiles of his youth full on . T HEY were gathered around the mantel , most of them , talking in voices at once hearty and tentative , glasses in hand . Drinks to melt the integument of twenty years and more  --  of course . From the group a man detached himself to come forward and pump his hand . " Davy ! Why , Davy Spanner ! " The lost face of Banks coalesced at once in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner that had battened on the years . He had been business manager of the crew . Banks conveyed him toward the others like a trophy . " Look who 's here ! " he crowed . " Our little toxic ? " Grinning a little stiffly , Spanner acknowledged , not without pleasure , the nickname paternally bestowed on him long ago by these men who had all been so much bigger than he , who had chaffingly , unmaliciously treated him as their mascot , perhaps , because of his size , but had unswervingly followed his direction . As a group they were still physically impressive carrying extra weight fairly well on their long bones . They gathered around to greet him . With the unfortunate sobriety of the latecomer , he noted , accepting a drink , that they were all , although not yet tipsy , a little relaxed , a trifle suffused , with the larger than life voices and gestures of men who had had a Few . A table set buffet style in a corner , and a coffee urn , had apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he took another , and plunged into the babble of expected questions , the " where you been all these years ? " ? the " what 're you doing now ? " ? the " whereabouts you living ? " One by one he remembered them all , even to the little personal tricks and ways they had had in the locker-room . Bates , whose enormous sweaty feet had been a loud joke with them all , was almost completely bald now , as was Goetschius , the polite quiet boy from upstate , who , politely as ever , bent his tonsure over Banks ' pictures of his house , his family . Reassuringly , they all looked pretty good . as he thought he did himself , but he wondered if they knew any better than he did , what had impelled them to come . " Horse " Chernowski , who stood nearest him , had driven up from Pennsylvania , beckoned on , Spanner wondered , by what urge to reasseverate the past ? In his ill-cut too thick tweeds , his great shoulders swollen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ projecting from the cuffs  --  his nickname fitted him still . He had been their dumb baby . stronger than any of the others , but dull of reaction ; once they had lost a race because of his slowness in going over the side when he had jammed his slide . " Ah , my God , Davy , " said Chernowski delightedly , " do you remember the cops picking us up for speeding after the big day  --  the night we drove back from Poughkeepsie ? " " Yes . Sure I remember , " said Spanner , but he had n't , until then . From across the room he saw Anderson , the stroke , nursing his drink at the mantel , staring at him ruefully , almost comprehendingly ; and encountering that blue gaze which had faced him steadily , in the inarticulate intimacy of three years of grueling practice , faraway incident , and triumph , there was much that he did remember . Handsome , intelligent son of a family which had contributed both money and achievement to the college for more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of campus approval that stretched between " grind " and " hero " than anyone Spanner had known . Spanner remembered him , effortlessly debonair and assured , burnished hair spotlighted over the satin knee-breeches of his costume as Archer in " The Beaux ' Stratagem , " or stripped and white-lipped , holding Spanner 's gaze with his own as the water seared past the shell . Although he had been as perilously near the prototype of campus hero as one could he without stuffiness or lampoonery , there had never been any of the glib sheen of the fair-haired boy about him , nothing in the just courtesy of his man-ner except the measurable flow of a certain noblesse oblige . He crossed now , to Spanner , and took , rather than shook , Spanner 's hand . " Davy ! " he said . " Well , Davy ! " The crisp intonation had the same ease , the ruddy hair had merely faded to tan , the eyes stared down at him now straight as ever , but from between lids with the faint flawed pink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was in his posture the controlled waver , the scarcely perceptible imbalance of the man who is always quietly , competently drunk . " You look fine , Davy , " he said , smiling . " You look fine too , Bob . " " Sure . Oh , sure , " he said , with a wry , self-derisive grimace . He indicated with his drink . " Look at us . Everyone looks fine . Householders all . Hard to believe we were the gents who took it full in the belly  --  depression , social consciousness . " His accent was a little slurred now . " And wars and pestilence , " he said more firmly . " Even if we were a little late for that . " He downed his drink . " You in the war , Bob ? " said Spanner , somewhat lamely . " Me ? Not me , " he said . " My kids were . Lost one  --  over Germany . " He walked over to the buffet , poured himself a drink , and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't it . Over Germany . We 're back to saying in Germany ' now . " He went on quickly , as if he had a speech in mind that he would hold back if he thought it over . " Remember the house I used to belong to ? Bleak House , ' they used to call it , sometimes , remember ? The one that got into the news in the thirties because they hung a swastika over the door . Or maybe somebody hung it onthem . " He drank again . " Could have been either way , " he said . Spanner nodded . He had begun to be sick of the word ' remember ' ; it seemed as if everyone , including his self of the night before , was intent on poking up through the golden unsplit waters of his youth the sudden sharp fin of sonic submerged reality , undefined , but about to become clear . " They were a nice bunch of fellows in our time , " said Spanner . " You know . . . Davy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The fellow was apologetic ; in his straight blue look there was a hint of guilt , of shame , as if he too , the previous night , had half dreamed and pondered , but unlike Spanner , had met the dark occupant of his dreamings face to face . " I wanted them to take you in , " Anderson said . " A few of us together could have pushed it through  --  but all the others made such a God-damned stink about it , we gave in . I suppose you heard . " He looked at Spanner , mistaking the latter 's unresponsiveness for accusation perhaps , and went on . " If we had n't all been so damned unseeing , so sure of ourselves in those days . . . . " He broke off . " Ah well , " he said , " that 's water over the dam . " And grasping Spanner 's shoulders he looked down at him in an unsteady hid for forgiveness , just before he released him with a brotherly slap on the back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was as if Spanner felt the flat of it , not between his shoulder blades , but stinging on his suddenly hot cheek  --  that sharp slap of revelation .
