Parity Is Here <P> U.S. farm prices last week reached Utopia , the legendary level called " parity . " The Department of Agriculture said that prices received by farmers were 131% of the 1909-14 level , up 36% in the past year ; that prices paid by farmers ( for equipment , clothes , etc. ) also were 131% of the base years , 7% over a year ago . Thus the relationship between farm income and farm outgo is the same as in the fat pre-war years . Except for a brief spell in 1937 , this magic balance had not been achieved since 1928 . <P> But Utopia is always somewhere else . The farmers want more . In Washington , Alabama 's Senator John Hollis Bankhead advised farmers to keep their cottonseed off the market until prices hit $60 a ton ( last week 's price : about $47 , an 18-year high ) . Wheat farmers have withheld so much ( about 40% ) of this year 's bumper 950,000,000 bushel crop that the conservative Bureau of Agricultural Economics last week turned tipster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within a few months . It now figures 1941 U.S. cash farm income at $10,500,000,000 , 15% above last year and the highest since 1929 . <P> Encouraged by the farmers ' rapacity , speculators continued to boom commodity prices . At week 's end , cotton prices were up 80% over the year 's low , at eleven-year highs , soybeans ( see p. 38 ) were up 75% , wheat 60% , both at four-year peaks .
