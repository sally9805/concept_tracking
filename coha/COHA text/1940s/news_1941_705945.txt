txt Pent-up investment demand cascaded into ? torrent of orders yesterday and deluged the U. S. Treasury with requests for $10 billion worth of bonds . The government was offering only $1,200 million , so allotments probably will be around 12% of amounts applied for . Orders poured in from all over the country , from insurance companies , savings banks , trust funds , commercial banks and well-to-do individuals . Asks Big Allotment Among those putting money on the barrel head was Comptroller Joseph D. of New York City who went down to the Federal Reserve Bank in Liberty Street and asked to buy $100 million for the city 's sinking funds . He will probably be allotted about $12 million . So popular was the offering that at one time during the day a value of more than three and a half points above par was indicated . This was by all odds the biggest premium ever attained in a few short hours on a new government issue . It was all the more dramatic because the amount involved was one the largest single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even so , the coupon rate of 21 , ' . % was regarded as low for so long-term an obligation . The maturity date is the most distant ever set on regular government securities-31 years with an optional call date in 26 years . No Overflow Into High Grade Corporates Dealers in high grade corporate bonds said that there was little if any evidence of this strong demand spilling over to their side of the fence .

Treasury bonds had been anticipating a long-term 2 , A% bond for several days although earlier this week there was word from Washington that the coupon might be 2%% . Consequently the terms of the issue bad not been fully discounted . Late Wednesday afternoon the December maturing 1 % notes which were given " rights " to subscribe at par to new 21 , Z% bonds ( to the extent of $204 million over and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 18-32 bid . 102 20-32 asked . Even that was regarded as an exceptionally strong premium . But when the news was published Thursday morning the market for the old notes quickly stepped up to 102 8-32 bid , 103 10-32 asked . Later in the day , they hit a top of 103 17-32 bid , 103 19-32 asked . Subsequently they receded toward the early , morning level . Carries Out Treasury Principles In Washington , Treasury Secretary Morgenthau expressed satisfaction at the way the bonds were being received . He pointed out that the premium being paid for the " rights " was the highest on record . Secretary Morgenthau explained that the long-term 214s were designed chiefly for insurance companies , savings banks and investors hungry for this type of bond . He added that the issue carries out the principles the Treasury is working for  --  long-term bonds for investors , bills for commercial banks and defense bonds for small investors . Mr. Morgenthau moved to prevent " free riding , " whereby subscribers immediately sell at a profit bonds allotted to them . He asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and warned them against lending money to customers for purchase of the bonds " beyond their legitimate requirements " Despite all the attempts to keep " free riders " away from this latest Treasury offering , observers here freely commented Thursday that many buyers were entering subscriptions merely to make around $30 a bond by subscribing at par and immediately reselling at around $1,030 a $1,000 bond . The Treasury 's next piece of financing is looked for later this month in the form of ? refunding operation for the Commodity Credit Corp . and the Reconstruction Finance Corp . The former has $204 million 1% notes coming due on November 15 and the latter has $297 million of 1% notes maturing November 1 . The belief is that this refunding will be handled through issuance of fairly short-term notes to the total extent of around $500 million . With the December maturing notes taken care of through this latest Treasury operation , the Government will have no important regular maturities until next March when $426 million 1 3/4% notes come due .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
