Some Americans have almost forgotten the atomic bomb . Some think of it as just another weapon , and think that an atomic war will be just another war . This week such ostrich notions were rudely jolted . One World or None ( McGraw-Hill ; $1 ) ' " a report on the full meaning of the atomic bomb " by 17 scientists ( including five Nobel prizewinners ) , generals and pundits , gave a preview of World War III . One World or None is a calm , hair-raising warning of swiftly approaching disaster . Americans who would like to die a natural death can read it with profit . <P> They will learn that a present-day atomic bomb , exploding half a mile above Manhattan 's Gramercy Park , would kill 300,000 people . But Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer , who bossed the great Los Alamos Laboratory , knows that more destructive bombs are in the cards . One type , he says which " has been investigated in a preliminary way , " will be too powerful for all except " very major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arnold treats this subject in more detail . If supplied from the first with atomic bombs , he believes , the B-29s of the Twentieth Air Force could have accomplished all they did in Japan in a single day 's raid . The cost , for bombs a measly $200,000,000 . " Destruction by air power , " says General Arnold , " has become too cheap and easy . . . . The existence of civilization is subject to the good will and good sense of the men who control air power . " <P> No Defense . None of the contributors to One World or None believes that there can be an effective defense against airborne or rocket-borne atomic bombs . In a blackly pessimistic chapter , Physicist Louis N. Ridenour , radar expert , explains how even the most elaborate precautions can not keep a good proportion of the bombs from hitting their targets . And just a few bombs , he feels , will be enough Before the start of World War III writes Physicist Edward U. Condon of the National Bureau of Standards , atomic saboteurs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a chosen Pearl Harbor day . " A target , to be safe must be surrounded by a sanitary area at least a mile in radius . Any house can be as dangerous to its surroundings as the greatest of powder magazines . Twenty thousand tons of TNT can be kept under the counter of a candy store . " <P> To guard against such sabotage , writes Condon , the U.S. would have to turn itself into a police state tighter than any in history . " Sabotage is no longer a threat to be kept in mind , " he says . " It is a fearful danger , and an attractive possibility for an aggressor . " <P> For those Americans who hope the bomb will remain a U.S. monopoly , the authors have little encouragement . Physicists Frederick Seitz , of the Carnegie Institute of Technology , and Hans Bethe of Cornell University believe that almost any industrial nation can start producing bombs in about five years . Stolen " secrets " will not be necessary , for there is no essential secret .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
