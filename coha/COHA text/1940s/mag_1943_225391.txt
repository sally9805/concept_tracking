Hearst 's International News Service last week lured away from the Associated Press one of the best U.S. foreign correspondents : good-looking , hard-working Clark Lee , who has traveled 40,000 miles over land &; sea in the last ten months for A.P . The switch earned Lee a handsome contract-one of the best a war correspondent ever got-and the rare prerogatives of a roving correspondent . <P> Lee , 36 , had been with A.P . since 1929 . He was born to newspapering : his father was a founder and first president of the United Press , his mother wrote for newspapers . When Lee turned up in Honolulu in 1936 as A.P . bureau chief , he married a native princess , Liliuokalani Kawana-nakoa . <P> Lee worked through China and Japan for over two years , traveling thousands of miles with the Jap armies . Jap Army officers did not care for his hard-hitting news stories , but they liked him well enough to warn him to get out of Shanghai three weeks before the attack on Pearl Harbor . <P> Lee ended up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were good reporting .

He also thought that he and TIME 'S Melville Jacoby , who was later killed in Australia , might be able to persuade Washington that the Philippines could be saved with some prompt assistance . <P> Last week Clark Lee was in Manhattan , awaiting passage overseas for his next chosen assignment ( " My ambition is to get to Berlin " ) . Behind him were Australia , the Solomons , a torpedoed aircraft carrier and a book ( They Call It Pacific ) . Ahead was a projected itinerary that most reporters dream about . Lee hopes some day to roll into Nanking with Generalissimo Chiang Kaishek , into Manila with General Douglas MacArthur , and down the main street of Tokyo with Admiral Halsey and his sailors , Major General Vandegrift and his marines , under a blanket of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun .
