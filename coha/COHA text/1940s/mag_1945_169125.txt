The U.S. was shoulder-deep last week in two great battles 13,000 miles apart-the battle of Luzon , in the Philippines , and the battle of the Ardennes in Belgium and Luxembourg ( see below ) . As combat operations , the two seemed as remote from one another as though fought on different planets . On the plane of global strategy and logistics , they were tightly interlocked . <P> The war in the Pacific was ahead of schedule , the war in Europe behind schedule because of one great mistake-the premature write-off of Germany . In September the Nazi armies had been driven , shredded and stumbling , out of Russia and France . Winston Churchill arrived in Quebec saying , " Victory is everywhere . " In Washington the Combined Chiefs of Staff , assuming that the Germans would quit before November , earmarked heavy shipments of men , arms and supplies for the Pacific . The Leyte invasion was moved up two months . <P> But the Allied attempt to flank the Westwall at Arnhem had failed . Germany 's main eastern battlefront , along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eisenhower 's margin of superiority in the west was worn down in frontal attacks against formidable defenses . V-E day was set back to 1944 's end-then to May 1945 . It was clear that the western Allies would need a lot more muscle to beat down their rugged , obdurate and resourceful foe . <P> But the pipelines to the Pacific were full and flowing . <P> When Rundstedt launched his counteroffensive in December , the Allies had to pay for their mistake . But , with their eyes open at last , they set out to pay a rock-bottom price . By quick and brilliant action , they stopped the German drive and shoved it back . <P> At this moment , Russia finally came through in southern Poland with what the Germans called " the greatest offensive of all time " ( see below ) . Instantly the slack in the ring around Germany snapped taut ; instantly the eastern front became a magnet pulling on German reserves , including those with which Rundstedt was still toying in the west . Much was hoped for from this new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a balm for inter-Allied political tensions . <P> Yet Russia would not win the battle of Germany alone : the Red armies would learn anew how Germany fights from her inner defenses . The western Allies would have to regroup and refill their armies , rebuild their supplies . The process would be slow and painful . The battle of Luzon was not being stopped , the Pacific pipelines were not being reversed , for the benefit of the European struggle . The new reserves would have to come from the remaining fat of a U.S. not yet stripped for total war .
