" The meeting will come to order ! " <P> Under the cobalt-blue ceiling and fantastic chandeliers of the Department of Labor Auditorium , the bustle and fidget of over 2,000 young people settled to a whisper . The members of the American Youth Congress , assembled in Washington for a four-day citizenship institute , " a monster lobby for jobs , peace , civil liberties , education and health , " came to order . A. Y. C. 's adopted mother , Mrs. Franklin D. Roosevelt , sat placidly in the second row . <P> Many a curious glance was directed at her . For once this sensible woman had put herself in an altogether too quixotic position . She was on record as believing that Communist influence in the A. Y. C. was negligible . As to that , the youngest youth in the hall knew that Mrs. Roosevelt was either kidding herself or being taken for a ride . <P> One of the " other " Roosevelts , Archibald , son of Archibald , son of President Theodore , sat by . The delegates ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there an unemployed Italian in a sweater , Negroes next to white friends , students , sharecroppers , a few " youths " with bald or greying heads ) were dog-tired . All day they had seen sights , visited Congressmen , argued , walked up &; down with rhyming placards : " Heed the Voice of 21,000,000 : Keep the C. C. C. Civilian ! " " Scholarships not Battleships ! " " Dies is FLIP-PITY about Civil LIBERTY ! " <P> But when Chairman Howard Ennes pounded his gavel , the weary delegates perked up . Not because they expected the speeches to be much fun , or because they thought the meeting would advance the A. Y. C. 's advertised aim : passage of the $500,000,000 Murray Youth Bill to establish a permanent Federal Youth Administration . They had come to see a sideshow . They had their eyes peeled for one Murray Plavner . <P> For two days Murray Plavner had done a lot of talking . He had praised Republican National Committee Chairman John D. M. Hamilton for refusing to send a Republican Party delegate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elements which , according to the Dies Committee , dominate it . " He had chided Mrs. Roosevelt for chiding Mr. Hamilton . He had made public an attack on the Congress signed by Gene Tunney and four other youngish men . And at this meet ing he had promised there would be action . <P> Jack McMichael , National Chairman of A. Y. C. , got up to speak . He rambled along about the New Deal , about the Ku Klux Klan . When he started deriding the Dies Committee- <P> " Point of Order ! Point of Order ! " shouted F. Steven McArthur , leaping to his feet . " I want to make a resolution . <P> We must clear ourselves of the charge of Communistic- " " You 're out of order ! " shouted Chairman Ennes . <P> " He 's not ! " yelled Peter Tropea , up front , waving a book in one hand . <P> " Shut up . Sit down ! Boo ! " roared the assembled youth . Chairman Ennes had Mr. McArthur tossed out . Speaker McMichael @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " shouted Archibald Roosevelt . " I wish to read a resolution . We must denounce Russia ! " " You 're out of order ! " cried Ennes . <P> " He 's not ! He 's not ! " yelled Peter Tropea , waving his book .
