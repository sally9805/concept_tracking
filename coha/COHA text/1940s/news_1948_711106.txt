txt Britain is making too-slow progress toward balancing her foreign trade ? and that 's the key to her economic wellbeing . She has cut her imports . She has spurred her exports . But Britain still spends far more abroad than she takes in from abroad . Recently this net spending has run around $200 million a month . And her gold and dollar reserves have dwindled to $2.4 billion . In the past two years Britain has overspent her foreign income by $4 billion . Britons are living on credit and unless they can balance their overseas income and expenditure they face bankruptcy . The Marshall plan , of course , could defer that bankruptcy . Chancellor of the Exchequer Cripps yesterday presented to Parliament an Economic Survey of 1948 , stressing the importance of Marshall plan aid . Story on Page 6 . What Britons Must Import To have enough to feed , clothe and house themselves , Britons must continuously import 70% of their wheat . 60% of their sugar , 50% of their meat , 95% of their fats , all their cotton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , most of their timber , and practically all non-ferrous metals and 25% of iron ore . In addition , all the oil to fuel their auto transport and many of their ships must be imported . So must the rubber to make tires . Britons , too , in pre-war years came to enjoy the citrus fruits , bananas , wines and tobaccos that came from abroad . And for entertainment they 've relied largely on imported American movies . The limited natural resources of the British Isles can not alone support a population of nearly 50 million on less than 100,000 square miles of territory . Why the Crisis This is no new situation : it has existed for the last century . Why , then . is Britain in the throes of a desperate crisis today when it was rich before 1913 and comfortably between the world was ? The short answer is the dissipation and destruction of Britain 's resources by two world wars . Britain . pioneer of the industrial revolution , had built up over the previous century a volume of visible and invisible exports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left a margin of around $S00 million a year for foreign investment . The mainstay of visible exports were coal , textiles and machinery . In addition , Britain earned a valuable invisible income from shipping , banking , insurance and overseas investments . Tile first check to Britain 's economy came from World War I when other nations , whom Britain had largely equipped with machinery and railroads , began to be serious competitors with British exports . Japan and India . for example , made serious inroads into Britain 's textile exports ; America competed in exports of machinery ; Poland began to supply part of Europe 's needs for coal . As a result of these and other factors . Britain 's balance of payments began to get into the red just before the second world war . The second world war had a devastating effect on British economy . Heavy drafts on 3ritain 's reserves of gold , foreign exchange , ind overseas investments were made to pay for imports of munitions . Foreign trade was reduced to a trickle . Loans Exhausted In Two Years Except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unbearable . Britain , previously a great creditor nation . emerged from the second world war with a $14 billion debt around her neck . To give Britain time to get on her feet , the American and Canadian loans were negotiated . It was expected these would last at least four or five years , but as things have turned out they have been exhausted within two years . So the British have to divert to exports a much greater proportion of their industrial output and manpower than pre-war . This means the British must export goods they desperately need at home and also reduce their imports of food and luxuries . Ever since the end of the war Britons have had to go short of all sorts of what are called " consumer goods " ? clothing , furniture , carpets and curtains , pots and pans , linen , cutlery , radios , gramophones , bicycles , autos , in fact - everything that a well fitted out citizen , or a well furnished home , requires . At the same time production of such goods has been consistently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality goods and the " throw outs " which are n't up to standard for export markets . Yet Chancellor Cripps has warned the nation that unless textile output is increased by 10% it soon will be necessary to cut the present clothes ration again in order to attain export targets . The clothing situation is only one instance of what Britons face . Similar compulsion to export applies to coal and machinery of all kinds . This year In order to carry out promises made under the Marshall plan Britain will have to ship abroad 13 million tons of coal , though the domestic ration for each Briton is only 1.5 tons a year . Even without the Marshall plan it would be necessary to export coal to pay for food . Coal is the commodity which so many of Britain 's European customers want more than anything else and without which they are reluctant to export the food Britain so badly needs . Machinery is another item demanded by Britain 's customers . So , though short of steel for home needs , much of this metal must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at home . In the third quarter of 1947 ( latest available figures ) the quantities of many goods in short supply in Britain which are being exported were already very much above the 1938 figures . For example , cutlery and hardware exports were 201% of the quarterly average of 1938. and a similiar figure was attained for vehicles which include automobiles. locomotives . ships and aircraft . Electrical goods were 180% of 1933 , machinery 163% , pottery 157% , and chemicals 153% . On the other hand woolen manufactures were only 91% of 1938 and cotton only 45% though rayon was 140% . Greater Austerity Ahead Now Britons find they have got to practice even greater austerity in their race to balance overseas income and expenditure whether they get Marshall plan aid or not . Though their standard of living is already much below pre-war they have been living above their means . The victory of labor at the General Election in 1945 inspired trade unions with the idea that a brave new world was to be had for the asking . In its first year of office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Trade unions insisted on shorter hours and wage hikes un : related to higher output . High wages supplemented by enormous subsidies on food , rent and utility clothing left far too many pound notes in the bands of citizens which in the absence of goods on store shelves were dissipated on holidays , travel , gambling and black market activities . The result was a serious increase in absenteeism In the mines and factories . Swollen government expenditure involved heavy taxation which sapped incentives to hard work and enterprise and discouraged saving . A vast army of bureaucrats , numbering nearly 2 million , are employed in administering the network of controls which choke the wheels of industry and take out of production thousands who otherwise could be employed in mines and factories . Productive industries for export are starved of manpower and the whole economy is distorted . Meantime , an unforeseen rise in world prices cut the value of the American and Canadian loans by a third ; that helped dissipate these loans before Britain has got on her feet . Production has been rising recently and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by independent statisticians of the London and Cambridge Economic Service : No comparisons are available with pre-war or for output per man hour . But output must be raised much further or Britons will starve . Blows to Utopian Dreams The fuel crisis last spring and the suspension of sterling convertibility last August were severe blows to the Labor government 's dreams of a socialist utopia . Sir Stafford Cripps was appointed Economic Czar to try to put Britain 's house in order before it was too late . New export targets were imposed to increase exports to 140% of pre-war in the early months of 1943 and to 160% by the end of this year but yesterday the-end-of-1948 target was reduced to 150% . In January . however . exports were 128% of 1938. or only 2% over that attained last September . At the same time import cuts of $960 million a year were imposed . A series of bilateral trade pacts has been negotiated , these are really barter pacts. for no country wishes to hold large quantities of inconvertible sterling and demands goods , gold or dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " very bad second " to the multilateralism on which Britain 's international trade was built up in the nineteenth century when sterling was freely convertible and a " Bill on London " was the basis of world commerce . But these pacts are the best that Britain can do at present . Price is becoming an increasingly important factor in the export market . After the war the world hunger for coal , textiles and machinery seemed inexhaustible and Britain could have sold anything it could produce at almost any price but she did n't concentrate enough on production for export . Today buyers are becoming m6re selective and Britain will find it harder to complete unless its prices are right . Chancellor Cripps has warned the nation of this new threat to exports and has asked for a wage freeze and higher output to bring British costs down .
