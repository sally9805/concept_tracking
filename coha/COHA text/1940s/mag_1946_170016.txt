Said a London chimney sweep : " Do n't fence me in . I want to get to the sea and breathe . " <P> Thirty million other Britons , straining to shake off the psychological soot of war , were set for a whopping vacation binge . Brighton , finally rid of barbed wire and pillboxes , was triumphantly ready for the Easter trade . Yachts and motorboats , many of them veterans of Dunkirk , were fought over by sea-hungry landlubbers . Butlin 's popular seaside camps , the workingman 's country clubs , had more customers than they could handle . While most people wanted to get out of the city , some provincials wanted to get into it : Thomas Cook &; Son offered an eight-guinea ( $34 ) junket to London , complete with guided tour of the bombed areas . <P> Famous vacation trains , like the Cornish Riviera Express ( nonstop London to Plymouth ) and the Golden Arrow ( London to Dover and Paris ) , were running again . Ex-R.A.F. pilots swarmed into the air-taxi business and got as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France ( prewar British Airways price : a little over 4 ) . Britain 's passport office was issuing a thousand passports a day , and hundreds of jealous wives wrote in , asking that their husbands ' applications be refused ; the wives suspected that the bounders merely wanted to visit wartime girl friends on the Continent . The Government did not encourage all this holiday hubbub , either , but for once Britons heeded neither their wives nor their Government . Each week , Cook 's alone received 100,000 bookings for trips abroad . <P> Even Bedsheets . Of all European countries , France was most enthusiastic in welcoming tourists and foreign exchange . Railways were mending their torn roadbeds , the glamorous Blue Train to the Riviera was back in service , nightclubs now got enough electricity to stay open till dawn , and the municipality of Nice grandly announced : " Our hotels are ready , our guests will lack neither bedsheets nor tablecloths . " But about half of France 's hotels were still closed , and many of the rest were filled with Frenchmen who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brittany were still dotted with maverick German mines . <P> But even in countries like Switzerland and Sweden , which had not been disfigured by the war , something was wrong . British tourists now had little money to spend abroad ( their Government allowed them to take only 75 each ) , and they were pale and poorly dressed . They betrayed an un-British and rather pathetic greed for unrationed food and clothes . The Continent 's professional hosts decided sadly that it would not be a real tourist season until the Americans came along .
