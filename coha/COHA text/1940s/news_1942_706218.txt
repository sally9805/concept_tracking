txt State Tax Change Sought Since it would never do for politicians to come to the aid of the " rich , " even if they do bear much the greater part of the tax burden , perhaps the Legislature of New York might be induced to allow a credit for earned income in computing the State income tax , as a substitute for the deduction of the Federal tax . This would , of course , help a good many of the " rich " since , contrary to public opinion , several of this type happen to render services for value received ; but it is true that the credit would benefit all income taxpayers as would , incidentally , , the Federal tax deduction . Until such time as Americans right themselves again in their choice of public servants , and inequitable taxation can be discussed on a plane other than that of economic class warfare , what about an earned income credit against the State income tax ?
