A year had passed since Harry Truman picked up the burden that he had dreaded would fall on him . He had known that whatever he did as President would inevitably be judged by what the people believed his predecessor might have done . This week heavily burdened Harry Truman realized full well that among his towering problems of leading the U.S. people was the still towering shadow of Franklin Roosevelt . <P> In his first few months in the White House Harry Truman had enjoyed a personal popularity-it was almost indistinguishable from sympathy-that few Presidents had ever achieved . At one time this popular sympathy had been greater ( according to Gallup polls ) than F.D.R. 's at its highest . The plain people had cottoned to the plain Missourian who seemed so eager to admit his inadequacy , but so humbly trustful of democracy that he was willing to take on burdens and make quick decisions . <P> Now , after twelve months , the plan people still liked Harry Truman as a plain man . But he was not a President who inspired their high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hatred . <P> They could not dislike him , but they could not admire him the way they felt they should . Harry Truman was a sincere , hard-working man who had unfortunately had to step into a job that was too big for him . A great many of the U.S. people felt sorry for him . <P> " The Best He Can .

In recent weeks Harry Truman had successfully applied a strong policy towards Russia . But the people did not seem to regard that as a solid accomplishment . Many still grumbled about " letting Russia get away with murder . " <P> Harry Truman , the President of the United States , was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Francisco stenographer : " You just sort of forget about him until he makes some sort of mistake . " A waitress in Harry <P> Truman 's own Kansas City exclaimed : " Funny , but you do n't hear many people talking about him any more . All I hear from my customers is when can they get a pair of nylons or a white shirt . " <P> President Truman had presented catalogues of wanted legislation , but he had failed to sell the issues ; he had failed to arouse or hold the people 's concern . In Washington an astute observer summed it up : " Congress still gets orders from the President , but now it does n't feel required to pay attention . It 's the power that Roosevelt put into the Presidency that is gone , under Truman . "
