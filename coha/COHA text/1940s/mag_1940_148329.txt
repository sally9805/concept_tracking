Lots of people have said sharp things about the Dies Committee on Un-American Activities . Few have been more vitriolic than goat-bearded William Dudley Pelley , leader of The Silvershirt Legion of America . Last June , one of the Committee 's investigators , Robert B. Barker , investigated his nation-saving activities and reported back that Pelley was just the Committee 's dish . With its sizzling frying pan all ready for Pelley , the Committee tossed out a line and hook to catch him . But Mr. Pelley dived for deeper water , and disappeared . <P> As other fish were caught and dropped into the pan to splutter , the Committee 's appetite for Mr. Pelley waned . Then , three weeks ago , Representative Frank Hook of Michigan inserted into the Congressional Record certain letters which seemed to show that Chairman Martin Dies was friendly to the Silvershirts . Alleged author of the letters : Leader Pelley . Congressman Hook , opposed to continuation of the Dies Committee , waved this evidence under the nose of Congress . Almost immediately the let ters were branded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , admitted forging them . Thereupon Mr. Hook withdrew his charges , grudgingly apologized . The affair reminded everybody of the question : Where was William Pelley ? Particularly , Committeeman Jerry Voorhis wanted to know . He had long been anxious to question Pelley . Presto ! Mr. Pelley leaped into view , right in the Committee 's midst . <P> How come ? " None of those letters were written by me. composed by me , or signed by me , " declared he , wagging his goatee , smiling with his teeth . " I am giving Martin Dies an absolutely clean bill of health . " That gave the Committee something to think about . Flustered , they postponed their questioning until next day . Then , having stoked the fire and readied the frying pan , in they popped Mr. Pelley . But the hotter the fire , the more Mr. Pelley seemed to enjoy it . <P> Quizzed on his fascistic Silvershirts , he boasted that his Legion had 25,000 members . Among his supporters he named John Richard Brinkley of Del Rio , Tex. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glands to impotent but hopeful men . Doc Brinkley lent him $5,000 , said Mr. Pelley . His Legion , founded in 1933 , " began propagandizing against the same things that this the Dies committee set out to expose , " he confided smoothly , while the Committee glared and squirmed . <P> Shushing irate young Congressman Voorhis , Acting Chairman Joe Starnes tried to pin the witness down . Said he : " You spoke approvingly of Hitler and his manner of control in Germany . Does your organization foster a program similar to that followed in Germany ? " <P> " I feel exactly as the Nazi Party in Germany felt regarding the Jewish element in our country . . , . " <P> " Are you anti-Semitic ? " <P> " I call myself very much so , " replied Mr. Pelley . " I say very freely that I am anti-Semitic . " <P> " If the Silvershirts had achieved their aim would you have become the leader of the Government ? " <P> " Probably . " <P> " And would you then have put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> " I probably would , sir , " answered Mr. Pelley . <P> " If the Dies Committee continues its investigation then would the Silvershirts fold up ? " demanded Representative Thomas of New Jersey .
