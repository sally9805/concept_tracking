" We must make plans to avoid mass unemployment after the war . We must not imagine that increased taxation and vast public works alone can do the job . . . . It must be done by the establishment of new businesses . . . . Industry must be given every incentive to expand . " <P> These words were noteworthy last week because they came from no free-enterprising businessman , but from New Dealing Harry Hopkins . Once , in the old days of " tax &; tax , spend &; spend , elect &; elect , " WPA Boss Harry Hopkins had spent over $5 billion on vast public works trying to prove that federal spending could make the U.S. economy move . But last week , in an article in the American Magazine , Spender Hopkins fervently embraced free enterprise . Skeptics might growl that this was merely a pre-election phony . But it seemed more than that . <P> As far back as 1939 , Hopkins , then Secretary of Commerce , admitted some doubt about public works and flirted cautiously with free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ federal wraps off business is surprisingly close to what businessmen , notably the Committee for Economic Development ( TIME , Sept. 11 ) , themselves want . Wrote Hopkins : <P> " A constant reliance upon large-scale Government spending . . . with heavier taxes , deficits . . . and perhaps increased competition with private business is not consistent with . . . our competitive system . Public works must be supplementary to the effort of the people . " <P> This effort can be best exerted , wrote Hopkins , by giving business greater incentive to expand and create jobs , chiefly by " levying taxes with an eye to their economic effects . " <P> To do this , said Hopkins , the Administration should : <P> Remove the excess-profits tax as " soon as the threat of inflation " vanishes . <P> Shift more of the burden of financing the federal Government onto the individual income tax-that is , lighten corporation and excise taxes . <P> Reduce heavy income taxes in the upper brackets until they are not so high as to " remove incentives for assuming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Boost buying power by lifting all taxes , i.e. , income and excise from those earning $15 , or less , a week . <P> All this would go down easily with most businessmen . But there was a bitter pill : Hopkins would boost the present wage- &-hour-act; floor under wages from 40 an hour to " at least 50 and subsequently 60 an hour . " ( After the article appeared , Florida 's Senator Claude Pepper drafted a Senate resolution to give the War Labor Board power to raise the floor to 65 . ) This , said Planner Hopkins , smoothly ignoring all hold-the-line thinking , should bring approval from " enlightened businessmen . " It would steady consumption " during the transition to peace . " <P> This seemed like bald politicking , like a broad wink to reassure labor leaders that Hopkins was still one of the boys . For to raise the wage floor would have little effect on established industries , most of which now pay hourly wages far above a 60 minimum . Those who would be affected , notably textile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumption .
