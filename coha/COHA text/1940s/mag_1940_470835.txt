WHAT follows here is not literature but a historic document . It is the account , in diary form , of how the old European order , the one that , to the greater or lesser satisfaction of all parties concerned , had been plodding on for eleven hundred years since Charlemagne , came to an end for a commonplace middle-aged couple , American husband and English wife , and their sixteen-year-old dog . It ended on the morning of June 17,1940 . Millions of Americans have been reading in their newspapers , these months and even these years , of refugees ; how they were driven from their homes just because the Germans wanted what they call Lebensraum ; how they had to sleep in ditches and go without food ; how they were machine-gunned on the road ; and all the rest . I used to read about them too in our decent little home forty miles southwest of Bordeaux , at Pyla near Arcachon , which is a sort of European Cape Cod , all complete with pine woods and sand dunes and lighthouses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very sorry when the first waves of Belgian refugees arrived in our village , early in June . We also felt very lucky and very superior . For we , in the southwesternmost corner of France , were safe . On the day when the Germans were already sweeping south from Boulogne and Amiens toward Evreux , on that day I was still working on a little book , intended to persuade American public opinion that France must have the Rhine for a frontier , and that Germany must be broken up into her old kingdoms and duchies . When the Paris HeraldTribune published Ambassador Bullitt 's warning to all Americans to leave France at the earliest moment , our worry was that our lease at Pyla expired on June 30th . What saved us , as we know in retrospect , was the requisitioning order . It was posted at Pyla on Thursday , June 13th . The Government was at Bordeaux ; the Ministry of Air was actually quartered in the best hotel at Pyla . They needed the villas for the officials ' families . The inhabitants were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' notice . We were on particularly good terms with the local authorities ; I went to see the mayor 's secretary . " Do n't worry . We shall see to it that they leave you alone . " Just the same I was not going to take chances . I started to pack our suitcases , much to the dissatisfaction of my wife who said I was a pessimist . On Saturday , June 15th , I drove to Bordeaux . I called at the Consulate and had lunch with G. , who said the situation was very serious . He advised me to get our passports in order . The Spanish frontier was less than one hundred and fifty miles distant , an afternoon 's drive in our Ford . I went home . Sunday we spent packing . In the evening we took the back seat out of the car , and loaded her up . Twenty-six pieces of baggage . Two large cases , containing my six hundred books , a smaller case containing manuscripts and notes , and two wardrobe trunks were to be left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night we were to spend under our own roof though we did not know it . II Monday , June 17th . We had intended to leave early , but what with one thing and another it was 9.30 by the time we said good-by to Madeleine . We said we should be hack for dinner ; we meant it . First , to the bank at Arcachon . We had between us 600 francs , about fourteen dollars at the prevailing rate ; the visas alone , we figured , would cost us a thousand . M. Dupin , the manager , said that the fifty pounds for which we had cabled to London ten days ago had not arrived . Still he kindly cashed a check for ten pounds-1,750 francs . We knew that he did not know whether he would be able to collect . We thanked him . We set out for Bordeaux at 10.30 . The center of the town was bedlam ; I had never seen so many cars in so small a space . A policeman waved us off as we tried to enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in session . ( We did not know it , but they were discussing the surrender of French freedom . ) By the time we reached the American Consulate it was 12.30 . The lobby was black with people , mostly foreigners hoping against hope for visas . G. said he would join us at lunch at the Splendide as soon as he could make it . On the terrace of the hotel we ran into the William Henry Chamberlins ; they had arrived from Tours the day before . We sat down for an ap6ritif ; Percy Philip , of the New Turk Times , detached himself from the crowd , told a funny story without sitting down , and vanished . Booking a table was not easy , but a consular visiting card did the trick . We were surrounded by what used to be called tout Paris . For months we had been meaning to go to Paris for a visit ; now Paris had come down to see us . At every table there was a Cabinet Minister 's wife , a foreign ambassador , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . G. appeared , accompanied by Hans , a young Dutchman who explained he had begged a lift on a French army truck at Orleans . Back to the American Consulate where the consul was on the point of entering the visa into my wife 's passport when he noticed that the passport expired that very day . To the British Consulate across the square , double quick . A hundred people outside ; most of them British subjects but not English ; Maltese , Cypriots , French , or Greek wives of sailors , all hoping to get away on the boat that was to leave next day . What with the heat , the fatigue , and the worry , my wife fainted on the sidewalk . A kindly Englishwoman brought her a glass of water ; she was the wife of one of the officials ; she took the passport and brought it back , duly renewed , in five minutes ; but for the contretemps we should have had to wait for hours . At 7.30 my wife had her American visa . It was G. 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our returning to Pyla . The danger was that the French might close down all road traffic . At 11 o'clock G. and Hans went to their respective rooms . We had n't any and no hope to find one ; just as a matter of form I tried the Splendide , the Bordeaux , and the Royal Gascogne ; nothing doing . About 11.30 we settled down in the front seat of our car for an uneasy night 's rest . Hundreds of people , mostly from Paris and the North , were spending the night in their cars around us . We dozed . Suddenly all the lights in the square went out . I glanced at my wrist watch . 12.23 . And then we heard them ? the bombs . We counted eight , in quick succession ; far away to the northwest , in the Gironde estuary I reckoned . Then the sirens began to shrill , far away too , then nearer and nearer . The popping of the anti-aircraft guns followed . We got out , my wife carrying Tosca and I an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locked the car . Some soldiers were running toward the Allees de Tourny ; we joined them . There was an elaborate dugout , a zigzag of sandbags reinforced with logs driven into the ground and forming a wall about eight feet high ; but there was no roof . The anti-aircraft artillery was hard at work for the next hour and a half . My wife lighted a cigarette and was booed . " Put out that match ! " Then the all-clear sounded . The lights came back . We returned to the car . Tuesday , June 18th . At 6 A.M. I drove the car to the big square in front of the Hotel de Bordeaux , about a quarter mile from where we spent the night . We found Hans standing there , with his jacket buttoned over his bare chest . He said he was scared stiff ; the Germans were sure to reach Bordeaux to-day , and would get him . He did not like the idea of a concentration camp . A French captain of colonial infantry was reading a paper . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been no news in this whole God-damned war . " But we have heard some very beautiful speeches , " he added . " Daladier , Reynaud , now Petain . And your Mr. Roosevelt too . Very fine speeches . " He said he wanted a cup of coffee and was off . At 7 we had breakfast in the hotel lobby , afterward a bath . At nine we met Publio , G. 's Spanish valet . He had obtained for us numbers in the line waiting at the Spanish Consulate-75 and 76 . We waited . Half an hour convinced us that at this rate our turn would come in about forty-eight hours . We went to the American Consulate and secured letters to the Spanish and Portuguese consuls . Returning to the Spanish Consulate , I was admitted at once . The consul was polite but firm . " It is absolutely impossible for me to give you a visa unless you have your Portuguese visa first . Go get it , and I 'll give orders that you shall be admitted immediately . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did not reckon with topography . The line at the Spanish Consulate formed in the street ; I could present my letter by walking up to the policeman at the door . The line at the Portuguese Consulate formed up a narrow staircase . The office was on the third floor . The only way to present my letter of introduction would have been to mow down the occupants of the staircase with a machine-gun . I got into line and waited . But not for long . The thing was obviously hopeless . There was no admission by numbers ; the two or three policemen present limited themselves to umpiring occasional fisticuffs . Publio went to telephone . He came back to report that the Portuguese officials had taken off the receiver and were not answering calls . That was that . At 1 o'clock we met G. and the Chamberlins at the Splendide . A table had been reserved , proof of the immense prestige of the United States Foreign Service . Chamberlin said the situation reminded him of the early days of the Russian revolution ? the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all routine . We had cocktails and ordered food . Ed Taylor turned up with his Swiss wife . We sat , eight at a table for four , more or less on one another 's laps . Hans reported that a fellow-Dutchman knew a Portuguese who would induce another Portuguese to come out of the beleaguered Consulate , take our passports , and return them visaed . This seemed the only possible solution . At 2.30 the headwaiter said he was very sorry but there was no lunch left . " Just like Russia , " said Chamberlin . I spoke to the proprietor . In ten minutes there arrived the thickest and juiciest French equivalent of an American planked steak for eight that I had ever seen . It was perfect . Unfortunately Hans and I were to meet our Dutch benefactor at the American Consulate at 3 . We wolfed our steak and ran for it . The Dutch interventionist proved a washout . We first had to drive across town to some sort of convalescent home in a garden , Negotiations with Portuguese No. 1 went on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Portuguese Consulate . Portuguese No. 2 did not come out . We waited in line for a couple of hours . I stood on the staircase in front of a window between stories . The window opened . Behind it stood the Portuguese consul , whom I had met several times before . " But my dear Mr. Bagger , what a delicious surprise ! I shall see you in three minutes . " The window closed . The pushing and elbowing on the staircase grew more and more desperate . At 7 o'clock I gave it up . G. was more emphatic than ever that we must not go back to Pyla . Nobody knew just where the Germans were ; we might be machine-gunned on the road . Bordeaux was not exactly safe , but still . We hated the idea of another night in the car . My wife had booked two cots at the American Rcd Cross shelter ; but they would not have dogs . G. proposed that we go sleep in his room ; he would take one of the cots . This we could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife , Tosca , and I would share G. 's bed and he would sleep on a mattress on the floor . We had a drink in a cafe with Mrs. Taylor who said one of her two Scottish terriers had been lost . This was not their first trouble , their car had been stolen a couple of nights ago , with most of their baggage . Ed was working . We were to meet for dinner at the Auberge Basque . But the Taylors never turned up . At 9.30 I went up to the Agence Radio , the improvised news service bureau where all the American correspondents did their work . I was told by Handler of the United Press that the Taylors had left Bordeaux . How , he could not say . I went to get our car from in front of the American Consulate , and drove it up to G. 's hotel . We spent a quiet night in G. 's room ; he did not after all sleep on the floor but shared a room with Publio whose roommate had left . III @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mob of four hundred in front of the Portuguese Consulate . Half a dozen soldiers , with steel helmets and fixed bayonets , struggled to maintain a kind of order . I waited in line till 11 o'clock . No use . We went back to the terrace of the Splendide , to have a drink . Our Amer Picon did not arrive . I stepped into the cafe to find the waiter . There at a table sat the Portuguese consul , having an aperitif with a friend . He hailed me . " But my dear Mr. Bagger , I am desolate about yesterday ? the heat ? the crowds ? overwork ? " " Why not give me a visa here and now ? " " But certainly , my dear friend , but certainly . " He whipped out a fountain pen , scribbled something in our passports . " Here you are . All you have to do now is to go back to the Consulate and have them stamped . " I said nothing . There was nothing to say . It was then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his hand half a dozen passports . " My dear Monsieur Skalski , with the greatest pleasure , " said the consul . " Monsieur Skalski --  -- Mr . Bagger . " He signed the passports . M. Skalski said , " You want your passports stamped ? Come along . " I went . M. Skalski explained . He was the Polish consul at Arcachon . He had been honorary Portuguese consul in Poland . He had his credentials with him . At the Consulate the luncheon recess had thinned the crowd somewhat . M. Skalski cut through it as a knife cuts through butter . The steel-helmeted corporal , overawed by M. Skalski 's diplomatic passport , saluted and let him pass . Five minutes later M. Skalski handed me our two passports , duly stamped . On the way back to the Splendide everything was arranged . We were to meet at Arcachon , in front of M. Skalski 's house , at 5 o'clock . We were to travel together in convoy . M. Skalski would secure our Spanish visas at Bayonne . I had just seen him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we pulled up in front of M. Skalski 's elegant villa in one of the fashionable streets of Arcachon . M. Skalski 's chauffeur was rigging up hammocks in a huge Packard limousine . " For the babies . " There was also a LaSalle sedan with a small black trailer looking like a coffin ; an elderly medium-sized Renault , and a small brand-new Renault . The latter was to be driven by a tall and bulky Polish blonde who had n't had much motoring experience ; she was now driving round the block , to get her hand in . In the house several Polish families , members of the convoy , were having a meal . That reminded me that we had no food in our car . I slipped downtown and bought two dozen bananas , some crackers , and three bottles of mineral water . I could not get any chocolate . At a quarter to nine we were off . The convoy was led by M. Skalski 's chauffeur in the old Renault ; he knew the short cut to the Biarritz road across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came next , followed by the LaSalle which belonged to M. Ostrowski , the famous Polish sculptor ; it was driven by a military-looking Polish chauffeur who could not speak a word of French . The baby Renault with the inexperienced blonde at the wheel brought up the rear . Very soon we left the road and were driving along a narrow lane . We stopped at a cottage . M. Skalski 's chauffeur got out and collected two gallon tins of gasoline . Then somebody else recalled a forgotten waterproof and made a detour to pick it up . Then the Packard had carburetor trouble . In half an hour we had made five miles . Our car was stopping in front of a cottage . I spoke to some French people in the garden ; they said they had just heard that the Germans were a few miles north of Bordeaux . The Polish cars caught up with us . I said to M. Skalski , " For heaven 's sake let 's get a move on , the Germans are at Bordeaux . " I drove off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars in sight . The chauffeur arrived in the battered Renault and reported that the others wanted to turn back ; it was no use , the Germans were at Bordeaux and would get us anyway . At this moment a small black Citroen pulled up smartly . A lady in black stepped out . " Good evening , " she said in English . It was Mme. L. , our FrancoPolish landlady . She was just the sort of person to have about in an emergency . I explained the situation . She drove back to fetch the convoy . In a few minutes she returned to report that they were coming on . If they lost us we all were to meet at the Hotel Moderne at St. jean-de-Luz , at 2 A.M. By this time it was dark . We had come less than fifteen miles in seventyfive minutes . This would never do . We waited for the headlights of the Polish cars to appear over the crest of the road , then made off , with Mme. L. in the lead ; she knew the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we took a sharp bend to the left . What had happened to the convoy ? Mme. L. drove back . She returned to report that the others must have missed the bend and gone straight on . We could only hope that they would reach St. Jean somehow . At Labouheyre , just before we hit the main Biarritz road , we ran into a jam . Some two hundred cars were thronging the main square , all southbound , refugee cars with mattresses and perambulators and bicycles tied to the roofs and the bumpers . Steel-helmeted soldiers with fixed bayonets . Officers , with electric torches , demanding papers . French officers , thank God ! One glanced at our passports and waved us on . We had lost Mme. L. somehow . We were now on the main Biarritz road , wide and straight but undulating like a Siberian railway at a fair , with a small ridge to cross every five or six miles . It was full of southbound cars driving close behind one another , but there was no up-traffic , so it was easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or three times we were stopped by soldiers who cursed us . " Douse your lights , you fools , the Italians are overhead . " St. Jean-de-Luz was ninety miles to the south . In half an hour we had left most of the traffic behind : ' It began to rain . About fifteen miles north of St. Jean I spotted a Citroen parked under some trees . It was Mme. L. 's car ; she was asleep over the wheel . We gave her some brandy and bananas . At Bayonne gendarmes asked for our papers ; they were very polite , as in normal times . We reached St. Jean in a downpour . It was exactly 2 A.M. when we stopped in front of the Hotel Moderne ? the agreed place at the agreed time . There were no Polish cars in sight . A sleepy porter said there were no rooms . The Hotel de la Poste had no rooms either , but they let us sleep in armchairs in the dining room . Thursday , June 20th . At 8.30 , after a bath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I sallied forth to look for our Polish friends . At the Hotel Moderne they had not heard of them . I returned to the hotel and smoked a pipe . About 10 I went out again . There , in front of a small caf ? , stood the unmistakable LaSalle with the trailer , and the baby Renault . I entered the caf ? . The whole party were having breakfast ; Mme. Skalski was feeding the babies . We had to drive back to Bayonne to get our Spanish visas . The Consulate was surrounded by a mob of four hundred people . Even M. Skalski 's diplomatic passport was no help . We were talking things over on the corner when the deluge came . In two minutes we were drenched to the skin . I had never seen such a thunderstorm in Europe . The rain came down in blinding black masses , like a waterspout . A continuous barrage of forked lightning interlaced with the flying buttresses of the Cathedral in a kind of infernal counterpoint . In the midst of it all our old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rushed out of the Portuguese Consulate , pursued by a mob waving passports at him . He held his head between his hands and screamed , " Go away ! No more visas ! " He jumped into a car , plowed through the writhing mass of visa-seekers and shot down the hill . M. Skalski said we must go to Hendaye for our Spanish visas . At St. Jean-deLuz we lunched at the Hotel de Paris with M. Ostrowski , his daughter , and his granddaughter . M. Skalski lunched at the Moderne . I was watching the LaSalle like a lynx ; M. Skalski had ridden in it that morning and I assumed that he would continue using it . At 4 o'clock I glimpsed M. Ostrowski . " Where is M. Skalski ? " " He drove to Hendaye in a taxi an hour ago . His family is still here , he is coming back . " My wife and I jumped into the Ford and drove off in pursuit . There was a traffic jam on the bridge . A lieutenant of gendarmerie asked for our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't go to Hendaye . " " But we were told that Americans and British people need no permit . " " Sorry , a new order came half an hour ago . You must go back to the prefecture at Bayonne . " We were stalemated . We drove back to the Moderne Mme. L. had just returned from Bayonne ; she said that a thousand people were fighting in front of the prefecture ; they all wanted permits . It was hopeless . But I was determined that we should sleep in a bed that night . I called at nine hotels ; there were no rooms . I stopped at a tenth , an attractive one that we had already passed up as sure to be full . " Of course you have no rooms . " " On the contrary , we have a very nice room with private bath . One hundred francs . " I paid the hundred francs on the spot and said we 'd be back later . In front of the Moderne my wife and M. Ostrowski , seated on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M. Ostrowski had been a lifelong friend of Joseph Conrad . My wife and he had been talking Conrad for the last two hours , forgetting about wars and visas and special military permits . M. Ostrowski was a very charming man ; he was probably the only member of the party to remain unruffled during those hectic days . I sat down and discussed Aristotle with M. Ostrowski . We had just got to St. Thomas Aquinas when out of a side street emerged William Henry Chamberlin and his wife ; a porter followed , carrying suitcases . They had just arrived from Bordeaux by train ; they were finding refugee existence increasingly difficult , on account of not having a car . We dined at the Bar Basque , with the Chamberlins . The whole American colony of the Left Bank was there . It was our last dinner in France ; it tasted good . We were told about the big air raid on Bordeaux , eight hours after we had left . Two hundred people had been killed . IV Friday , June 21st . At 7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chief . " He is not here . " " Where is he ? " " Out there on the bridge , directing traffic . " There he was , a young man with a mustache like Hitler 's , in a gray suit , wearing a beret . " I am an American writer . I have been working for France . Here are my credentials . " " What do you want ? " " I want to go to the frontier . I do n't want to go back to Bayonne , to fight for a permit . " " You do n't have to . All Americans and British may pass . A new order came last night . " I hurried back to the hotel , collected Esther and Tosca , and drove off without pausing for breakfast . I was taking no chances ; the military authorities might change their minds once more . Ten lovely winding miles among the green foothills of the Pyrenees . There was no traffic ; all cars carrying other than American or British subjects and diplomats were turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only sign of anything amiss was a log barricade athwart the road every three miles or so , leaving just room enough for a single car to zigzag across . We reached Hendaye at 9 , and were directed by a policeman to the Spanish Consulate at the far end of the town . At the Consulate sixty or seventy peopie were waiting , Czechs , Poles , Belgians , a handful of English , five or six Americans . My wife and I talked to a tall , jollylooking Englishman in a tweed jacket . He told us that he had blown up the ammunition works which he had been managing for the French somewhere near Tours ; then he helped the French sappers to blow up bridges across the Loire . The waiting was not too bad , but we had had no breakfast , and every ten minutes or so somebody came up with a diplomatic passport of some sort and was admitted out of turn , amidst booing . At 12 o'clock my wife and I went in with a batch of ten ; they then locked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting in the lobby in cane chairs . The Englishman who had been blowing up bridges settled down to a comfortable snooze . There was a Brazilian couple who had come down from Paris on a tandem bicycle ; they had lost all their luggage . A Polish manufacturer , whom I had known by sight at Arcachon , was holding forth in loud tones ; he knew everything better than anybody else and did not make a secret of it . A charming , gentlemanly , tall Chinese was explaining the intricacies of currency regulations to my wife . A Belgian boy of eighteen was sobbing softly ; he thought , for some reason or other , that his parents were in Spain ; he was afraid that if the Germans caught him he would be made to fight against the Allies . At 1 o'clock we were admitted into the inner office . An hour later we came out ; but out of the ten of us only five had been granted visas . The Belgian boy was turned down because he was Belgian and of military age . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he claimed was a diplomatic one , lacked some stamp or other . At first he blustered ; then he wept ; in the end he was thrown out , almost , if not quite , literally . The Chinese took it differently . The consular official said to him , " The Chinese Government has not recognized General Franco . As far as Spain is concerned China does not . v4:111**4 exist . We do not grant visas to the nationals of a non-existent country . " The Chinese said , " A boat sails from Bilbao for Shanghai in a few days . All want is to sail in it . " The official said , " China does not exist . " The Chinese pulled himself up to his five feet ten and said gently , " There are three thousand Spaniards in Shanghai to-day , making money . Ask them whether China exists or not . Also when you had your troubles England and France opened their gates wide for your refugees . Of both sides . Good morning . " He walked out , head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was past 4 P.M. when we joined the mile-long line of cars that stretched from the railroad station down the hill to the international bridge across the Bidassoa . There were two files , one for ordinary mortals like ourselves , on the right ; another in the middle , for cars with the magic plate C.D. ( corps diplomatique ) . A third lane , on the left , was kept open for northbound traffic coming from Spain . From time to time the line of cars moved on a little . The cars on our left , those with the C.D. plates , moved much faster . Some of them were Dutch , a few Belgians , the majority were Polish . I had never imagined there could be so many diplomats on so small a planet . By 6.45 we had moved down the mile . Our car was now the second behind the barrier separating France from the no man 's land on the Bidassoa bridge . We hoped to get across and sleep at Irun that night . At 7 o'clock sharp the French gendarmes announced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not to open it until . 9 in the morning . Most of the refugees , including ourselves , took the announcement apathetically enough , but there were two rebels . One was a stalwart American lady in a leather jerkin and an aviator 's crash helmet . She attacked the gendarme in charge in a fluent and vigorous French , explaining that she simply had to reach Bilbao to stop a cargo of American relief supplies which otherwise might go on to Bordeaux and be seized by the Germans . She was the last person to drive a car across that day . The other protestant was less successful . He was a tall elderly man with a stoop and a Mongolian cast of countenance , looking yellow and ill ; he was extremely well dressed in a dark blue overcoat and suit and a gray Homburg that bespoke St. James 's Street . He was talking in rapid French and I could not hear what he said , but I stepped nearer to have a look . Sure enough , it was Titulescu , ex-Rumanian Prime Minister , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . In fact , he proclaimed it in an indignant treble ; it was an unheard-of scandal that he should be held up like this . " You do n't seem to realize that I am Titulescu . " An officer of gendarmerie was called , then another still higher up ; they decided that M. le Prisident might walk across the bridge into Spain . Half an hour later M. le President came back , more incensed than ever ; those Spaniards , he cried , shaking with anger , had taken away his passport and then told him to walk back . " They did not realize that I am Titulescu , " he added . A gendarme behind me murmured , " Or maybe they realized that he is Titulescu . " The ex-President of the League of Nations was not a popular personage in Franquist Spain . We decided it was inadvisable to leave our cars overnight ; it was also useless , as finding rooms or even a meal was out of the question . So the two girls of the Relief staff and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we could rake up was two small tins of Oa and three bottles of Evian water . I had a flask of brandy , so we did not fare so badly . The mists descended on the hills of Spain ; from the head of the bridge we could see the lights of Irun . Our last night on the soil of France was peaceful . The Relief people curled up in their Chevrolet and went to sleep . My wife tried to do the same , with Tosca on her lap . All along the sidewalks , with their heads propped against suitcases or the wall , refugees were snoring . I stayed up late , talking to two customs guards ; we smoked our pipes and cursed the swine who had betrayed France . After midnight a column of large black Renaults glided down the bridge along the third , or northbound , lane ; they made very little noise and had all their lights out ; the gendarmes opened the barrier and they drove across into Spain . I did not need to be told who they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Splcndide at Bordeaux only a few nights back . They were Government cars . One of the customs guards spat . " I 'll bet those cars are lined with gold . " About 2 A.M. I sat down behind the steering wheel and pretended to rest . V Saturday , June 22nd . I must have dozed , for glancing at my watch I found it was 5 o'clock . By 7.15 , having stood in line nearly two hours , I had our two passports stamped . There were still the customs ; the French examined the cars carefully , looking for currency and gold . My wifc and I were entitled to take 10,000 francs out of France . We had only 4,200 francs between us . The frontier opened at 8.45 . Two minutes later our car was parked on Spanish soil . We had hoped for breakfast ; we were disappointed . The next three hours we were kept busy . Contrasted with the congenital muddle and the fast-increasing official disintegration , tempered by occasional friendliness , on the French side , the cold-blooded efficiency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost frightening . We had to have our passports stamped ; we had to see three different officials about our car , two more about currency , one about baggage , and when all this was done we had to go to the Military Command and get a permit to enter Spain ! Eight separate moves in all . There was waiting , but there was no confusion . Each motorist was given a young soldier for an escort ; mine was a friendly fellow , and extremely courteous . He took me from one cubbyhole to the next , apologizing profusely when we had to wait , but never releasing his firm grip on our passports and other papers . I witnessed one incident . A Belgian woman just ahead of me in the passport queue was told she had to go back to France ; her Portuguese visa was not properly stamped . Her husband , whose papers were in order , said the Portuguese official at Bayonne must have made a mistake . The Spaniard was adamant ; the woman had to go back . " But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enter ! " she cried . " I 'll have to stay on the bridge ! " The official shrugged . The woman threw herself on the ground , screamed and kicked ; her husband and two soldiers carried her into a room ; a doctor was called . The American girl next to me wept ; we never knew how the affair ended . We had one pleasant surprise : nobody bothered about our baggage . At the Military Command our passports were marked with an itinerary : **38;1763;TOOLONG frontier ; we had to stick to it or face arrest . We had every intention to stick to it . At 12 o'clock we were free to proceed . We went to San Sebastian and were directed to the Andia restaurant . We had a magnificent lunch , the first square meal since St. Jean two days ago . Having heard a good deal about food shortage in Spain , the quality and variety of the food , and even more the enormous portions , astonished us ; but the prices were three to four times those charged in France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened on all sides , tier behind tier of forest-clad mountain ; but driving was a terrific strain and all I could do was to keep the car from going over the precipice . I do n't know how I managed to reach Alsasua , a little town in Navarra , down in the valley on the far side . We stopped at an inn and had some coffee . I rented a room and lay down in my clothes on an extremely hard but very clean bed . I slept ? it seemed an eternity ? for thirty minutes . But now I felt completely rested . We drove on in the downpour . Soon the skies cleared ; we were now in the province of Alava ; the road was very bad , narrow , excessively cambered , and full of potholes , but straight enough . Or so I thought . We were going at fifty when , emerging from a slight curve , we found ourselves in a wholly unannounced Sbend that dipped under a railroad trestle on our right . The surface was smooth , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wrong way . Braking was out of the question ; at our speed a disaster seemed inevitable . The car skidded across to the left ; I swerved her away from a wall with an inch to spare ; she skidded back on to the right and shot through the opening under the bridge . Right ahead there was a black heap in the road . I stopped the car about six inches behind it . " By God , you were lucky ! I expected you to crash into us , " said a voice in French . A man stood beside what had been left of the Peugeot ; his face was covered with blood . " Ten minutes ago we had done what you did just now ; only we did not stop as you did . " The car had crashed into a poplar ; it was now a mass of twisted scrap iron ; the road was littered with suitcases . Miraculously , the driver only had his face cut , and his wife and child were unhurt . We gave him some brandy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to send help from Vitoria , only a few miles ahead . At that moment a big Buick issued from the bend , with the leisurely wisdom of local knowledge ; the two Spaniards in it took charge of the situation . On we went . About seven o'clock we crossed the border of Old Castile ; the country was just as I had always imagined it : rocky gorges lined with crags tufted by a solitary pine , then beautifully molded hills , light green , or tawny yellow like the backs of reposing lions . The villages seemed incredibly poor . We reached Burgos at 9 . We passed the Hotel Condestable , which we had heard was the best ; it looked pretentious ; we inquired for the Maria Isabel , also recommended , found it , booked a comfortable enough room , and sat down to a tasty and copious dinner . At Irun we were allowed to change only 1,000 French francs-500 per person . What with the terrific price of gasoline and two long cables I had sent from San Sebastian , we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill , let alone to keep us in gasoline to Salamanca . The proprietor said he could not change any money ; it was strictly forbidden . The Banca de Espaiia , the only one authorized to change , was closed until Monday . This meant not only the loss of a whole day but also a hundred pesetas for the room and food , money which we could ill spare . In different circumstances a Sunday in Burgos would have delighted us ; as it was , we cursed our luck . It would have been better to stay in San Sebastian . Sunday , June 23rd . At ten I went to High Mass in the Cathedral . The archaic stateliness of the Mozarabic rite was most impressive , and I marvelled no end at the beautiful Latin elocution of the priest ; somehow it was the most natural Latin I had ever heard , it sounded as if it were his native language and as if he never spoke any other . It was very lovely . The light in the Cathedral was a warm golden brown , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the French cathedrals I knew . Coming out I met M. Ostrowski who was admiring the wonderful Gothic sculpture of the porch . In the afternoon my wife and I and Tosca walked to a fair in progress along the river bank ; the din was unbelievable , the crowds were enormous . What surprised me was the amount of food displayed in the tents : prawns , hams , sausages , olives , pickles , pastries , candy . I had been told in France that Spain was starving ; G. told me that when he had visited San Sebastian in January he had to leave after two days because he did not get enough to eat . I asked the hotel proprietor what was the truth of the matter ; he said he did not know about San Sebastian , but Burgos was the capital of a comparatively fertile self-supporting district and things were not bad . " But you just wait until you penetrate farther into New Castile , " he warned . Monday , June 24th . It took me an hour and a half to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more ? and two pound notes at the Banca de Espana . We left Burgos at 10.30 and had already gone ten miles when we discovered that the hotel people had forgotten to provide the sandwiches I had ordered . Just how unfortunate this was we did not realize at the time . We reached Valladolid at 1 P.M. I had visions of a good lunch and of a visit to the Cathedral where I believed , rightly or wrongly , Columbus was buried . Vain dreams ! There was a barrier across the road . A rascallylooking young man , in shirt sleeves , jumped on the running board and said he would guide us through town . His cronies swung the barrier aside . I explained , in my best Castilian , that I needed no guide , that I had no money , and would he please let us go on ? His face fell , but evidently he felt that , having assumed official airs , he could not draw back now ; he muttered the Spanish equivalent of " That will be all right " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unexpectedly short . The pilot jumped off ; my wife gave him some French cigarettes , at which his face lighted up , and he said something like " Come again ! " We knew by now that there was a tobacco famine in Spain , and cigarettes were the most valued form of tip or bribe . He ran hack into town , to look for the next carload of refugees who had no money , only cigarettes . We cursed him and all his works ; he had cheated us out of our lunch ; but I would not consider going back into town . The country through which we now drove was absolute deadly desert . The only live beings we saw were some starved-looking crows . It was very hot and close ; it was also getting on to 3 o'clock and we had breakfasted at 8 . I began to feel giddy . I said , " See that clump of trees ? " It was the first clump of trees to be seen for miles . " We 'll stop there and rest a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for within the next fifty yards the car gave a sickening lurch and there came a grinding and groaning sound from the rear . In a word , a puncture . We stopped . We had no more brandy left . I hauled out the jack . I said , " That jack will never lift this load . " I was never more right in my life . About a hundred and fifty yards back we had passed a roadmender 's hut . I walked back to it and knocked on the door . No answer . I opened the door . On a low stool sat a nanny-goat and grinned at me . I shouted , " Monsieur le patron ! Hombre ! " There was a wooden structure in the back of the hut , like the upper berths in a forecastle . It contained hay . The hay parted and a face appeared . " Good afternoon , sir . What can I do for you ? " said the face . Castilian courtesy is perfect in any circumstances . The face climbed down . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble , combining the Spanish word " coche , " meaning car , with a pantomime expressing utter despair . The man understood . We went hack to the cache . The nanny-goat came too . The man had never jacked up a car , but he was remarkably intelligent . The first thing he said was that this jack would never lift that load . He was right . We worked , or rather he worked ; I instructed , hoped , and prayed . Three times the car rose ? almost ; three times it collapsed . The rain began to come down in sheets . Three cars whizzed by . Belgian cars . I waved . They whizzed on . Two more cars . Polish cars . I waved . They stepped on the gas . The roadmender said , " I have an idea . " He ran back to the house and returned wearing a visored khaki cap , like that of a gendarme . " I am an official , " he said simply . A big gray Packard approached . The roadmender stood in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Packard stopped . It had a Paris number plate . I explained my plight . The driver alighted and dug out a fine big jack from his dickey . In another five minutes we had changed the wheel . In the meantime my wife spoke to the lady in the Packard and discovered that our benefactors were English , ex-residents of Paris . My wife said we had been unable to buy any food . The lady gave us some cheese and bread . We restored the jack and the Packard drove off . At this moment a squad of Spanish motorcycle gendarmes arrived , looking very smart in khaki and patent leather . The roadmender explained the facts . The officer said he was desolate that we should have had such trouble on a Spanish road and that they had not come on the scene in dine to help . I shook hands with the officer and with all the gendarmes ; they made off . The shower had given me an idea . I took off my old Burberry , and braced myself for a speech . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Refugee . Many coats . Fine coats . From London . Water does not go through . Please have one . " The roadmender looked at me , then at the Burberry . He said , " Do you mean that you want to give this to me ? " I said , " Yes . " The roadmender 's wife said , " And is it true that the water does not go through ? " I said , " Look . " The cloudburst had only stopped ten minutes ago ; the water was running from the coat ; I showed them the inside ; it was dry . The wife 's face beamed . The roadmender said , " Many thanks , Selion " He was dignified and restrained to the last ; but I could see that for some time to come he was to be the happiest roadmender in the province of Zamora . We shook hands , and they trotted off , roadmender , roadmender 's wife , and roadmender 's nanny-goat . It was 4.30 . We had meant to reach the frontier that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but we had no spare tire and we were on the verge of collapse from hunger and heat . Salamanca was only forty miles away . Salamanca for us . We arrived , without further mishap , a little before 6 . The Hotel de Salamanca gave us a comfortable room , and we hurried back to the Plaza Mayor and sat under the arcades in a cafe and had sandwiches and beer . Then we walked up to the Cathedral , but it was closed for the night . Dinner consisted of one dish only , a measure of social welfare copied from Nazi Germany . It was not a very good dish and they charged the same price for it as we had paid at Burgos for first-rate meals . The wireless was blaring out news in Spanish , a bulletin from Rome announcing that the Italians had sunk half the British fleet ; we had heard this particular news so often that it did not trouble us . VI Tuesday , June 251h . We left Salamanca at 9.30 ; the coffee at the hotel was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drive to the frontier ; but what a seventy miles ! After Ciudad Rodrigo we saw the first signpost marked LISBOA . Then and there began thirty miles across some of the more hopeless stretches of Dante 's Inferno . I had never imagined that such desolation could exist anywhere in Europe . A country made entirely of stone , sickly yellow or dingy gray , with here and there a single clump of some dwarfed bush , juniper or lentisk , just to emphasize the absence of life all around . A few leprous-looking sheep guarded by a man in rags who looked like a wax model of inbred degeneracy . The road a mere lane , excavated rather than made , only in a few places wide enough for two cars to pass . There were no signposts , and after the first ten or fifteen miles there was not even a lonely scarecrow of a shepherd to nod a toothless , wordless answer to our half-hearted query . At last a battered board , dangling in the hot wind , informed us that we were about to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the worthy capital of the land of the damned . After half an hour 's waiting in line along the meanest of village streets our car was shepherded into the square in front of the railroad station and customs office . There were about fifteen to eighteen cars arranged along the four sides of the square , and they moved up as the two or three cars , tortured at a time by the executioners of the Dogana , were released and despatched to the frontier . It appeared that the Spaniards turned every car inside out , ransacked every piece of baggage , and searched all occupants ? all this , to prevent them taking pesetas out of Spain . The manners of the Spanish officials were impeccable throughout . They managed to combine a devilish malice with smooth courtesy , a feat of which the average American or Englishman would be incapable . We waited for over six hours in that station square , under a blazing African sun . I had only eight pesetas left out of the seven hundred that we had spent in three days , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little restaurant , but not having the price of two hot meals , I did not find out whether they served any . I managed to buy a small piece of cheese and a slice of sausage , for five pesetas . We still had a bottle of tepid mineral water . There was no shade ; there was a scorching hot wind and smoke from the occasional trains . Our fellow-refugees , or most of them , were not of the sort to make an unpleasant day less unpleasant . There were three large Buicks with Belgian number plates , filled by what seemed a single family with their retinue ; four or five young boys and girls , very unfriendly and illmannered , and as many secretaries and servants . After we had crossed the frontier , late in the evening , I learned that it was the family of M. Pierlot , the Socialist ex-Premier of Belgium . There were also some fat purse-proud Czechs and Poles with overdressed wives from Paris , in sumptuous American cars ; they looked like , and undoubtedly were , successful war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in good time . At 6 P.M. our turn came . Two boys took every piece of luggage ? there were twenty-six of them ? out of the car and carried them into the customs office . A couple of carabincros poked under the seats and the floor carpet ; rummaged in the pockets , emptied the tool compartment , looked under the bonnet . In the office I was asked to open everything ; four officers ran their hands through the suitcases and bags ; they were tremendously intrigued by my twenty-four pipes and by several reams of typing paper . They were very thorough , and handled everything with extreme care , folding back meticulously the clothes they had disturbed . Then , at a sign from the boss , an officer asked me to turn out my pockets . The three more pipes that thus came to light created a sensation . He ran his hands over my body ; it was a perfunctory search , but it was a search . Also it was a farce . For they never examined my big laundry bag ; had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it just there . These proceedings took over half an hour . It took another fifteen minutes to put everything back into the car . The two boys worked like experts . They , as also the customs officers , had ample opportunity to collect souvenirs ; when I later examined our possessions nothing was missing . I gave the boys my last two pesetas and half of a two-ounce tin of Craven Mixture . The tobacco made them dance with joy . It was past 7 o'clock when the squad of four cars ? ours , two Belgians , and a French Fiat ? were expedited to the frontier in charge of a carabinero who helped himself to a seat in a Belgian Packard . We crossed the village , and presently we drove along a straight road rising gently in open country . There was a chain stretched across the road ; behind it stood a low whitewashed building , half a dozen cars parked in line , and a group of gray-clad soldiers with Swisslooking k6pis . There was also a large sky-blue sign with white lettering : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chain . It was a great moment ; our troubles seemed to have come to an at least temporary end . For Spain had been enemy country ; we had not actually been ill-treated , but the hostility was there just the same , in the newspapers and broadcasts , in the eyes and the attitudes of practically everyone we had met , save the Basque people at the hotel in Burgos , one roadmender , and a priest or two . The very air of Spain had oppressed us ; we had expected a Fascist atmosphere but what we found seemed more Nazi than Fascist . Two Portuguese frontier guards , with rifles flung across their backs , came walking down the line of cars . When they saw our number plate they stopped , all wrapped up in smiles , " Inglis ? " " American e inglesa . " " Aliados ! " We shook hands . It was a new world , a world of friends . The country was grand , a vast upland horizon reminding us of the Causse of Larzac in southern France , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line of the mountains of Beira . A delicious fresh breeze attested that we were 3.000 feet up . The sullen dingy square of Fuente de Oilona , only a couple of miles back , seemed to belong to another planet . About 7.30 a group approached from the direction of Vilar Formosa ; men in black , with grave , kindly Latin faces ; little rotund , smiling ladies in gay summer clothes . The mayor , the judge , the doctor , all the official world of the frontier village , and their wives . They walked down the line , accompanied by soldiers . The soldiers carried large open bags and held them out to the refugees . Round golden-brown loaves of freshly baked Portuguese bread , still warm from the oven ; the best white bread in the world , as we were to find . Tins of delicious large sardines . Bars of chocolate . The ladies distributed sweet crackers and tins of condensed milk for the children . As long as we live we shall not forget the Portuguese officials of Vilar Formoso . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with an armlet bearing the letters B.E.C. He looked very English . I walked up to him . " Good evening . My name is Wall . Can I do anything for you ? " Two other young men with armlets arrived . " Mr. Ycattnan . Mr. Holroyd . " We learned next day what B.E.C. stood for : British Emergency Committee . But we learned within the next ten minutes what B.E.C. did . They introduced us to the officer of the frontier guards , a tall , smiling , fair man looking more Swedish than Iberian , very smart in his blue-gray tunic . " Lieutenant Antonio Julio . " The lieutenant spoke French ; he was very apologetic ; it was a very modest house , his house in the square , and a very modest bedroom ; but it was his best , and all he had to offer . Would we honor him by accepting it for the night ? Would we accept ! That solved the question of quarters . Next we were guided to the customs office in the village square ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in French : " Awfully sorry to trouble you , but would you mind opening one of your suitcases ? No matter which one . It is the law , we must ask you to do it . " I lifted a suitcase from the car . The official put on a pair of clean white gloves . I opened the suitcase . The official took off his gloves . " That will be all . Merci , Monsieur . " The whore customs procedure took less than ten minutes . Next , " Come and have some supper . " It was Mr. Yeatman speaking . We went to a large barn up the village street . Inside there were tables and chairs and packing-cases to sit on , a few cots , there were straw-covered demijohns , by the dozen , and cases of beer . Two young Englishmen were cutting sandwiches ; another was making coffee ; two others were serving . " What will you have ? " They gave us bowls of soup ; they gave us delicious roast-beef sandwiches , salad , cheese , cake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they offered us beer and whisky ; they gave Tosca a luscious slice of roast beef and a dishful of water . We sat round a low table , with candles stuck into empty bottles in front of us ; we ate and drank and smoked and talked . We had been through a nightmare ; it seemed very unreal ; this was a good dream , but it was also true . Mr. Wall seemed worried . lie turned to me . " Are you all right about money ? " I said I had 3,200 French francs and 13 shillings of English silver . " No escudos ? " " Not a one . We expect there 's money waiting for us at Lisbon . " " Do n't change your French francs now . You wo n't get anything for them . You may do better in a few days ' time . In the meantime you must have money . I am treasurer . I can not lend you any ; we are only supposed to lend to British people . So I 'll let your wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to Lisbon . Tell me if you need more . " I said that was awfully good of him , but he did not know me from Adam and I had no security to offer . " Your wife has a British passport . You will pay back the loan at the British Consulate either at Oporto or at Lisbon ? whichever is convenient . Or else you can pay me . Here is my card . " Such were the methods of the B.E.C. at the frontier station of Vilar Formoso . British Emergency Committee . A group of young and prosperous business men from Oporto . They had driven up in their cars , the hundred difficult miles along narrow mountain roads ; they also had a couple of trucks for provisions . They hired the empty barn and fitted it out as a canteen . They slept on the cots , taking turns , if and when they had a chance . In three days they distributed 2,000 kilos of bread , 5,000 eggs , and two bullocks in the form of roast-beef sandwiches , not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ babies . They found rooms for people . They financed the whole thing out of their own pockets , with a small subsidy from His Majesty 's Consul at Oporto . They fed all corners , regardless of nationality ; those who had money paid what they chose to ; most refugees had no money , and paid nothing . My wife , Tosca , and I slept that night in the best bedroom of Tenente Antonio Julio . In the morning his wife fed us on fragrant coffee , white cheese , homebaked bread , and homemade cherry jam . While we ate she showed us the doctor 's diploma of their son and a cherished edition of Os Lusiades , the great national epic of Camocns . Another thing we shall remember is the little room , with its red-silk hangings , over the elms of the main square of Vilar Formoso , in the house that belonged to the lieutenant of the frontier guards and his little , smiling , dark wife . And here , on this happy note , our log might as well end ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight days , including the two and a half spent in Bordeaux , to reach , from our home near Arcachon , the Portuguese frontier and safety .
