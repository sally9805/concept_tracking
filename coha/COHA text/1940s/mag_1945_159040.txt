For nearly a week the peaceful , prosperous town ( pop . 15,000 ) of Idaho Falls , on the lush east bank of Idaho 's Snake River , had been swarming with Mormon pilgrims and sightseers at the rate of 8,000 a day . The Chamber of Commerce scoured the countryside for 50 miles around to find places for travelers to eat and sleep . <P> The cause of this fomentation of tourists was a gleaming , new , $750,000 Latter-day Saints Temple . The sixth temple in the U.S. , it was to be dedicated in an elaborate three-day ceremony . <P> For five days last week the temple was open to all-backsliders and non-Mormons included . During the dedication ceremony and forever after , the seven-acre sanctuary will be closed to all but church members in extra good standing. * <P> *To enter a temple , good-standing Mormons must be " morally clean , " accept doctrines and sustain authorities of the church , have no sympathy with new-rule-breaking polygamists . Anybody may go into a not-so-holy Mormon tabernacle or church .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
