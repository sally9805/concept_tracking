THE OLD BREED-George McMillan-Infantry Journal Press ( $6.50 ) . <P> " The remembered war , " says George McMillan , onetime technical sergeant in the 1st Marine Division , " is sometimes very different from the fought war . " In The Old Breed , his division 's remembrance book , Author McMillan lets his facts about fighting fall where they may , gives the full treatment to the asides . In the process he achieves one of the most readable of the 100-odd unit histories of World War II already published . <P> The 1st U.S. Marine Division was the first U.S. division to take the offensive in War II . It went into the boondocks as a brigade in the fall of 1940 and did not come out until it licked the Japanese at Guadalcanal two years later . Between times the division learned to take it-from Solomons Island ( Md. ) to the Solomon Islands ( Pacific ) , an 8,600-mile jump . <P> During its four months on Guadalcanal the division was almost written off several times . When asked whether the hard-pressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Navy Secretary Knox said : " I do n't want to make any predictions , but every man out there , ashore or afloat , will give a good account of himself . " When this word came to Guadalcanal one sergeant mused : " Ya know , they 're kicking up a stink about us back in the States . " Said a private first class : " That 's nice . " <P> Between crises on Guadalcanal the division amused itself with a parody ( to the tune of Bless ' em All ) : <P> Oh , we asked for the Army to come to Tulagi , <P> But Douglas MacArthur said " No ! " <P> He gave as his reason , <P> " This is n't the season . <P> Besides , there is no U.S.O. " <P> But the Army came and so did the best thing that ever happened to the division : a long rest in Australia , where people get false teeth early . Australian girls could n't believe the marines ' molars were their own . " Finally , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and took hold of my teeth and tried to yank ' em and I let her . She was sure surprised when nothing gave . " Before the division left Melbourne most of the men " were in some stage of a serious love affair with an Australian girl . " <P> Rocks for Charles Boyer . From Australia , General MacArthur sent the1st Division to Cape Gloucester , which was so miserable one sergeant swore : " In the next war I ai n't even gon na plant a victory garden . " The Japs were n't too numerous , but Hill 660 was steep and slippery and it rained all the time . " The wells of fountain pens clogged ; pencils came apart at the seams in less than a week , blades of pocket knives rusted together , " McMillan remembers . Shellfire caused giant , rotten trees to tremble and fall ; 25 men died as victims of such odd accidents of jungle fighting .                    @
