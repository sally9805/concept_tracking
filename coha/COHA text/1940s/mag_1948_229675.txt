Food Minister John Strachey , who keeps Britons ' rations short , is long of nose , patience and temper . He has smiled tolerantly through many a public heckling from food-short Britons . Last week he got it hot &; heavy again from howling Scots housewives in his own constituency at Dundee : " We want food ; we do n't want empty promises . " Outside , after the speech , a crowd of women gave him a raucous parting boo . There was clearly nothing a gentleman could say , but what a gentleman could do John Strachey did : very courteously , he tipped his hat .
