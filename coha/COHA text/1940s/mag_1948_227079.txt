At 7:40 a.m. , Harry , Bess and Margaret Truman drove down to the station through the quiet streets of Independence . Most of the neighbors were still sleeping late after a hard night 's celebration . But Harry Truman was ruddy-faced , fresh and rested . <P> He joked and chatted with some 150 friends who turned out to cheer at the station . Then the " Truman Victory Special " chuffed away through the President 's native Missouri on its last triumphant ride . Small towns flashed by in a blur of smiling faces and waving handkerchiefs ; farmers saluted from the fields . <P> " Open the Gates . " In victory , Harry Truman was happy and humble . He visited reporters in the press car , laughingly chided them for their bum guesses . At Missouri 's drab state capital , Jefferson City , he quieted the cheers of several thousand well-wishers . " After the election 's over , " he said , " I bear no malice or feel badly toward anyone , because the fellow who lost feels badly enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most wonderful thing that ever happened to a man . But this is a terrible responsibility and you must stand behind me . " <P> At St. Louis ' gloomy , cavernous Union Station , 10,000 people pushed and shouted for a look at him , but many were blocked in the concourse by glass doors . Through a microphone on the rear platform , Harry Truman shouted : " Let the people behind those bars get in if they want to . Open the gates ! Open the gates ! " <P> The gates were opened and the crowd swirled around the train . Someone handed the President a copy of an early election-night edition of the Truman-hating Chicago Tribune with a banner line : DEWEY DEFEATS TRUMAN , and he held up the paper to the crowd , grinning . <P> On Every Perch . Washington , which months ago had abandoned Harry Truman to the Dewey landslide , now pulled itself together fast . It was set to stage one of the biggest of its conquering heroes ' welcomes . Government workers and schoolchildren were let out for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , every perch and post on the hero 's highway of Pennsylvania Avenue was taken . Police estimated the crowd at 750,000 . <P> Ranking Government officials , who had left Harry Truman to mourn alone at what they thought would be his own wake , now scrambled for places at the trainside . Outwardly , at least , the President was forgiving &; forgetting . He even had a smile for South Carolina 's Senator Olin D. Johnston , a pioneer of the Southern civil rights revolt , who said he voted for the President . <P> Then Harry Truman rode in glory through the thunder of applause to the White House. * From the north portico , he told the cheering crowd : " It is overwhelming . It makes a man study and wonder whether he is worthy of the confidence , worthy of the responsibility which has been thrust upon him . " <P> * Last week , the White House was closed to all sightseeing tours and big social events . Reason : repairs . The great marble staircase , supported by crumbling bricks , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Later , the Trumans probably will move across the street to Blair House while repairs are completed .
