No sooner was Harry Truman back in Washington than White House aides hastened to spread the soothing word : the Boss was not in a vindictive mood . There would be no wholesale firings in the new Administration . But some changes were certainly in the works . <P> The first hints were not long in coming . Outside the White House photographers approached Defense Secretary James V. Forrestal , who had taken no part in the campaign . " Have n't you got enough pictures of us ? " asked the secretary . Said a photographer : " Yes , but another four years is just beginning . " " But not for me , " replied Forrestal with a grin . <P> Another hint came from Treasury Secretary John Snyder , who had let it be known that he was anxious to get back to a better-paying job in private life . Other Cabinet shifts were in the wind . At the behest of the President , Secretary of State George Marshall had again &; again deferred his retirement . White House aides let the word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Under Secretary Robert Lovett with him . Among Democratic politicos there was little doubt that the ax was sharp for Army Secretary Kenneth Royall , who had remarked that Harry Truman 's re-election was not " essential " to the national defense . <P> Scores of names had already been suggested for their places . Everyone from Chief Justice Fred Vinson to ECA 's Roving Ambassador Averell Harriman had been mentioned as a possible replacement for George Marshall . Ex-M.I.T . President Karl Compton suddenly popped into the picture as a possible next Secretary of Defense . As available as Available Jones was Harry Truman 's old crony Mon C. Wallgren , who had just lost his job as governor of Washington . And there was even talk of bringing back the old sulphurous , incorruptible Harold Ickes.
