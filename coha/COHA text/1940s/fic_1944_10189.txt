" Why ? " Simon asked . " Because I always figgered they were waitin ' for something . Maybe this is it . " That afternoon , Savanna went to market with Prudence . She moved from market to market like a queen , her rich dark hair with its hint of red gleaming in the sun , her fine healthy blooming body carried proudly . Mrs. Alston watched her from her sulky with small , wondering eyes . She sat for some minutes , giving no orders to the driver , her vast mound of flesh still as molding jelly , her blue eyes , in her high round cheeks , watching , waiting . She poked her driver once , and the horse moved slowly as Savanna went proud and smiling into Mr. Twiggs ' store . When she came out , Mrs. Alston said , not shiftingany of her great bulk , merely lifting her voice , " Mrs. Scott ! " She repeated her cry again , now lifting her arm . Prudence touched Savanna , and Savanna came forward , surprised and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I 'd like to talk to you , Mrs. Scott . " " Bliss , " said Savanna pleasantly . " What ? You told me Scott . " " Then it was my mistake , ma'am . " " Get in the carriage . " " Ma'am . . . " You 've got nothing to take you home at this hour of the day . Step in . " Savanna gathered her skirts in one hand , touched Prudence 's arm with the other , and did as she was bid , a fast , sharp light in her eyes . Mrs. Alston did not look at her , but poked the driver once again , and settled her gaze on the slow-moving street . " I do n't like women , " she said , smoothing out her rustling skirts . " Even at my age . But there 's a kind of snap in you that 's nice . " The round curved lips were smiling . " Thank you , ma'am , " shesaid , waiting for the words which lay beneath words . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alston looked at her over her fat cheeks , and smiled . When Mrs. Alston smiled , she exerted the same charm as her son . Savanna was tractable . " Thank you , ma'am . " " A bright , pretty woman like you can do with some guiding  --  if you 'll forgive an old lady 's presumption . "  | " Indeed , ma'am . " " Besides . . . " " Yes 'm ? " She made no answer . They came to the house on Washington Street , a fine house with broad steps and Ionic columns . Savanna stood obediently in the drawing room , and with a sharp eye matched the outlines of this room to the rooms on Green Street , but felt no touch of envy . A handsome room , in impeccable taste , with a delicate shimmering chandelier . She looked at the chandelier with pursed lips ; she liked light , a great deal of light , spread over everything . Mrs. Alston sat down and struck the arm of the chair beside her . " We 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about that tree of a husband of yours . Is he a good husband ? " Her little eyes sparkled . Savanna sat down smiling , her head high . " He is , ma'am . " " You 're not sorry you married him ? " Savanna looked at her and said only , " Lordy ! " with a faint laugh . The little eyes were still on her . " A backwoodsman  --  a cracker ? " " Ma'am ! " " Rude of me ? That 's what other folks call him . " Savanna pressed her lips together and folded her hands tightly . Mrs. Alston placed the cups carefully on the saucers and waited for the Negro man to bring the coffee . When she had poured it , she said lightly , " Men make their women . If I know about him then I 'll know about you . " " Men make their women ! " Mrs. Alston looked at her swiftly . Savanna thought she detected a faint puffing of Mrs. Alston 's lips as if she wanted to smile . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her lips , an eager hot answer lying upon them , but something arrested her  --  an unexpected sense of impotent youth . She was a little frightened ; she became vehement in her effort to escape it . " Ma'am , I could n't agree to that for a moment ! " A smile spread on Mrs. Alston 's face . She lay back in her chair , surveying Savanna , allowing the silence to deepen . Savanna was angry at her sudden uneasiness . She tightened her lips , resolving to let the silence sink as deep as it chose . After a few moments , Mrs. Alston 's smile faded . She drew her/self erect and reached for her coffee cup . She said softly , " I told Michael , after the Governor 's reception , That girl is myself , fifty years ago . ' That 's what I thought of you , Mrs. Scott . " Savanna stared and had nothing to say . Mrs. Alston struck at her suddenly with her voice . " It 's a compliment . " Savanna 's hands were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alston was not dispensingpleasantries . She was a fierce and dreadful old woman . Her small eyes were like freshly sharpened weapons . Savanna felt defenselessbefore her power and possessiveness . " Fifty years ago , when Georgia was being built as a state , women as well as men were tough . We fought real things in those days , Mrs. Scott . We respectedreal things . We were n't afraid of ideas . I 've lived through that . I 'm old . I 've only a few pleasures left . But you 're young . And you do n't know what I 'm talking about . " Savanna continued to stare at her , faint , dark fear stirring in her heart . Mrs. Alston went on with an odd detachment , as if Savanna were of no importance whatever . Savanna listened , and her heart steadied . " Southern women are now meant for different things . I 've watched ' em being molded . But you , young woman . . . " She lifted her eyebrows above half-closed eyes . " I 'm just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Mrs. Alston 's head turned with an alertness that seemed close to pain . " Michael , " she called . " That you , Michael ? " Down the stairs floated a voice . " Later , ma'am . " Then , " Bill-eel " She flushed and looked at Savanna quickly , and away . It was as if some of her strength had been suddenly sapped . The silence ceased to be oppressive to Savanna . She heard Mrs. Alston say in a low voice , " I hate men almost more'n I do women  --  for a fact . " " Why , ma'am ? " " Women change with hard blows and humiliation . But never men . " Savanna was brave now . She inclined her head toward the door . " I should think you had a son who would please any mother . " Mrs. Alston sat as if half-drowsing , her head against her hand . She answered politely . " 1 'm not a fool , young woman . I know that boys , raised with bowie knives and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little silver bell beside her , and when the Negro man appeared , handed him the coffee pot without a word . Before he reached the door , her voice cut in bluntly . " Is he all right , Fred ? "  | " Just bleedin ' a little on the forehead , ma'am . " She clasped her puffy hands and raised them to her puffy mouth , and sat silent till the filled coffee pot returned . When she spoke her voice was deceptive  --  soft and low . " His father was a hot-blood . He was the first man in the state to own a hundred slaves . " She smiled at Savanna but not in a way which demanded an answering smile . " He was lord of the earth and the air . He was lord of four-footed beasts and two-footed beasts . He made the laws and no one appealedthem . " She smoothed out the silk of her dress , smoothed it , and smoothed it . Her eyes shot upward . " Would you have cared for such a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't think so . " " He was very handsome . . . Michael 's his son . " She spoke conversationally , snapping her fingers for Savanna 's cup . " Michael needed a good licking once a week , but his father said , He 'll be master one day . Let him feel his power . ' Michael killed a boy . His father said , Michael had to teach him a lesson . ' Michael 's never gotten over teaching folks lessons , men and women . " She sharpened her eyes on Savanna , " Somehow , I 've never missed one of those lessons . They 're very enlightening . " She gave a faint " haw . " Savanna felt a slight faraway anger rising within her . This old lady had dignity and grandeur , but she talked like a slap in the Lice . Mrs. Alston 's eyes were narrowed . " I reckon you 're not too disciplined either . " Savanna 's checks flushed and her eyes , which never made a pretense of concealment , cast all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm doing , ma'am ! " " Do n't you think Michael knows ? Young woman , he 's got the I pest reasons in the world . He 's a lord , he 's a prince , the earth makes when he walks . He does n't know that times change . " She paused . " Would you and Michael make a good pair ? " 1 n Savanna 's eyes was sudden anger . " Please apologize , ma'am . Please apologize ! " Mrs. Alston was startled . The small " haw ! " broke in her throat again . " For what , God save me ? " Coffee splashed on the cherrywood table as Savanna 's cup came down on its saucer . Her hands were like ice . Her voice was high because her throat was constricted . " Ma'am , you 're tryin ' to scare me . Why for ? "  |p204Mrs  . Alston laughed faintly , but did not answer . " Whyfor , ma'am ? I do n't scare easily . " " Why would I want to frighten you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tight together . " Ma'am , I 'm not afraid to live as big and free as I like , because I know why I 'm doing it and where I 'm bound for . I 'd hate your son 's lessons , and maybe  --  I 'd hate him ! " Mrs. Alston smiled slowly , her hand stroking and restroking the lap of her gown . Her voice was deceptively gentle . " I reckon I can understand that , young woman , if I can remember back fifty years . But the trouble is , you 're not living fifty years ago . You 're living now and you live in the world that my husband made . " She lay back in shapeless grandeur , her eyes on the chandelier , her voice iron . " I know what Southern women were once like , and I know what they have become . I know them to the soul and beyond . Southern women once cut homes out of the wilderness . Now they take what 's left when their men folks are through . They move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond them is a great bordello . With ice in their veins , they can make chastity a profession . " Savanna clasped her fingers hard . " You sound a little like my Ma . " " Your mama 's a Southern lady , is n't she ? A sacred white lady ? " Savanna lifted her head sharply . " She 's had a hard life ! " " But she 's white , is n't she ? Then she 's a lady . Have n't men given her a career  --  an ice-cold , sacred white lady career in which she may conceive respectable children in agony and watch men go for enjoymentto that great black bordello ? " " You 're a terrible woman ! " Mrs. Alston 's eyes were closed , her little mouth puckered . " Do I speak too harshly ? Usually I mind my words well . I gave you coffee this afternoon to see if I really liked you . " She smiled a little . " I find that I do . What I 'm saying means nothing to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studied her clasped hands for a moment and then went on softly , " If I say that sacred white womanhood has been used for every purpose under the sun , from shooting niggers to going bankrupt , I 'm saying that women are guilty . They 've forgotten what they are . You . . . " " That 's not the way they think in Gilmer County , ma'am , " she said , but her heart was constricted . ( Black Venus had stood on thep205road and wept . She would never forget it , for it was she who had slapped Venus ' face . ) Mrs. Alston watched the Negro man put a hot toddy down by the fire . " It 's growing into a useful legend . Nobody believed it when I was a girl , but it 's spreading well . " She shook the coffee pot and Peered in through the open top . Then she looked at Savanna with her little lips puffed . " If a white woman must take what is given her , why should n't she drive a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't she ? " Savanna felt the coldness deepen within her . " Why do you ask me , ma'am ? " " I wondered what you would answer . " Her eyes went past the ( ire , past the mug , back to her small , puffy hands , stroking her dress . She hesitated for some moments , then she said quietly , " I brought you here for one purpose  --  to say that my son , having been raised in the aforementioned world , has conceived an irresistible admiration for you . " Savanna 's eyes were slow flames . " Ma'am ! " Mrs. Alston lay back in her chair , her eyes hard and firm before Savanna 's . " I 've learned from those lessons of his that he 's not to be balked . But then  --  maybe his time for learning has come . " Savanna rose slowly , and leaned for a moment against her chair . " He 'll learn nothing from me , ma'am , " she said in a voice she stove to keep calm . Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " My name is Bliss , not Scott ! " Savanna was trembling deep inside her . She felt herself strugglingfor something more important than identification . Mrs. Alston stared at her . " Why fuss ? " " My husband suits me , and his name is Bliss . " Savanna gripped er chair tightly . " You meant it kindly , telling me , ma'am . I 'll thank you for that . " " If Michael saw you now , standing there , you 'd have little choice . " Savanna moved abruptly , and held out her hand to Mrs. Alston . " Good-by , " she said , " I do n't apologize any more than you do , ma'am , but I 'll say thank you just the same . " For what ? " asked Mrs. Alston . " I do n't know exactly for what . "  |p206She  went out swiftly , tripping over the door lintel , breathing only when she had closed the door . She lifted her skirts high to go down the steps as quickly as possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breathless for a moment to show that she was not in flight . But she showed her bravery too long . Behind her the door opened , and she heard his voice and his feet running down the steps . She moved hurriedly into the walk , but he reached her side in a moment . She had a sudden wild impulse to laugh . She looked at him withoutreticence , and though he came close to her , her eyes did not waver . She felt a faint unmistakable pulse of excitement . Who was he in relation to herself ? He stood before her , obliging her to stop , smiling a little now that he found her so still . Her eyes moved over the attributes which she understood , his physical power , for he was as big as Simon , his bluely-melting eyes framed in the deep lines , his nose fine like his mother 's but broad at the base to give sensuality to the wide planes of his face , his lower lip heavy , describinga deliberate gaiety , a slow relentlessness . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild mountain look in her eyes . " You ran away , ma'am . " A smile caught at his mouth , the smile which came with the voice reserved for women . " I did not run away , sir , " she answered with an odd indignation , moving from the tree . " Oh . . . " He shifted himself slightly so that he still stood in her path . " But now I 'm going home . " Her eyes returned to his face , tracingwith less submerged excitement the lines about his eyes . " I 'll walk with you .. . She smiled slightly for the first time . " I 'd rather go alone . " He stood near her , his hand against the tree . " Why ? " he asked at length , his upper lip barely moving . She stood silent , looking out at the street , her eyes following a woman who passed them , her crinolines swaying , her shawl in a point down her back . The woman had no face , for her bonnet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 've got a heap of thinking to do , sir , " she answered , watching the sway of the crinoline . " I reckon I 'd think better alone . " His voice was subtly caressing , modulated to her cars alone . " What does a woman think of ? "  |p207Her  eyes came back swiftly to his face . She laughed suddenly , showing the great dimples in her cheeks . She did not answer for a moment , laughing and looking at him , feeling the pulse beat in her throat . " You 'd be surprised , " she said , lowering her head , but looking at him . " My , you would be surprised . " " Would I ? I do n't think so , ma'am . " He moved closer to her , his back against the tree , his arm above her head . He had shut the world out , with a subtle but unmistakable finality . She was alone with him , and the street was illusion . Suddenly she laughed very low . Simon could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Alston said , " Laugh that way again . " Suddenly she was enjoyingherself , candidly and robustly . Such open pursuit had a value , for it demanded none of the subtleties which she did not possess . She laughed clearly and frankly . " What do you want , sir ? " The hand above her head was an open hand , in line and positioncaressing . He looked at her with his heavy lower lip thrust out in a smile . He answered gently . " What do you think I want ? " " Friendship ? " He looked above her . His eyes were on her bonnet , on her brow and her cheeks , finally on her eyes . Then he laughed . " Ma'am , I 'm a gentleman ! What else would I want ? " Her black eyes were flashing ; the laugh was in her throat again . I its hand slipped down from the tree , and lay palm up , waiting for hers . " Are we friends ? " " Certainly . " She was vigorously , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not take his hand . And he did not withdraw it . " Good-by , sir , " she said , friendliness beaming from her rich hair , her irrepressible eyes , the high smooth curve of her cheeks . He looked down at his open hand . After a moment he said softly , " What kind of a woman are you ? " She threw back her head . Her eyes followed a sulky clown the street and stared for a moment into the eyes of the driver who turned his head to look at them . Her heart was beating quickly . She said , away , past his shoulder , " I 'm just a woman who asks nothingfree of this world . Have you never met such a one ? " " No , " he said . She looked at him swiftly . " You do n't believe in such a woman ? " " No. "  |p208Anger  rose . The blood came back to her face . She tightened her bonnet bow under her chin with a snap . " Then you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Will you too , ma'am ? " he asked with his faint caress . She went past him to the sidewalk and looked back with a bright dazzling candor . " I 've learned a heap , Mr. Alston . But maybe one lesson is n't enough . "  |p209SIMON  STOOD BY THE DOOR OF THE HOUSE AND LISTENED FOR SOMEtime . He had stayed away from the Legislature for a week before the Christmas recess , but still he could not resume his seat . He turned abruptly and went down the stairs and out onto the terrace . The more he found out the less he knew . He needed knowledge and facts and the wide world on which to feed . He wanted books and papers and controversies . Northern newspapers were barred from the South . He had found this out by devious quest and blunt questions . But he needed to know the temper and opinion of peoplefrom Nebraska to the China Seas . He needed to come out of a dim world , dimly purposed . Quietness of mind and body was not a virtue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his mind ; he must think with his voice , loudly and challengingly . The North was the enemy of the South , the West was a threat . Who called them enemies , and why ? The South was a part of the whole . Was the whole well or sick ? Was life a revolving , an overturning of the outworn , or was it greed and lusting for other men 's goods , and the destruction of hope and order ? I e watched the portly frame of Hare , who was walking with a light quick movement across the road . He watched with a dull unconcern , his eyes traveling along with Hare as his eyes might have traveled apathetically after a woman . When Hare turned the cornerhe would not remember having seen him. are reached the Masonic Temple and saw Simon . He stood looking across at Simon for a moment , then he raised his hand . Simon did not move readily . Hare had to lift his hand a second time . Then Simon sprang across the street as if some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Hare with a slight smile . Simon said , " No , " with lowered head . " Reckon I was trying to think . "  |p210Hare  laughed and started to walk , and Simon fell slowly into step . " I spoke to Waller , " Hare said . " You met Andrew J. Waller of Richmond County ? " " No . " Hare was silent for a moment . " He 's hard to make out . But he wants you to come and talk . He says war 's coming . He 's feared for the Union.He wants to talk about it . He 's been fighting in the Hall , year in , year out , for women 's rights . Waller 's Woman Bill they call it . Comes up every session . Wants women to have their own property rights and be able to vote . Is that radical enough for you ? " Simon laughed suddenly . " That 'll do . " " It 's fatten we go see him . Tomorrow night ? " " Tomorrow night would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind . He 'd learn , even if he traveled the hard way . He moved along with Hare , suddenly alive . He 'd get what he wanted anywhere and everywhere , and not rely on printed pages . He 'd learn the only true way , from flesh and blood and men 's own words , just the way he had always learned . He listened to Hare now . " Waller was a Whig once . Do n't know where he got his fancy ideas . Heard tell his Ma put him up to fighting for women 's rights . I 've got nothing against it and a proper respect for women 's brains . " Intuitively , it seemed , Simon raised his eyes as they came before the post office . " I sent for that book a long time ago , " he said , " I always hope . Will you wait for me ? " When he came out of the post office he came slowly , both hands clasping a package , his eyes reading and rereading " Simon Bliss , Esq. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Simon Bliss , Esq. , Milledgeville , Ga . " Ile looked at Hare with wide , brown eyes . " This is it , " he said softly . " I thought maybe it would n't even come ! " " What ? " " The book by Helper . " Hare looked around swiftly . " God Almighty ! Not so loud ! " Simon ceased to work the strings loose and put the book under his arm . " This means a lot to me , " he said , a quietness in his voice now . " More than anyone can guess . "  | " Keep quiet about it , " said Hare , his small eyes steely . " That was true what I told you , about the man in Spaulding County .

" " You hear that ? " he whispered under his breath , and Savanna nodded . " God Almighty ! " " Look , " he said the next day to Murphy coming last down the stairs from the Hall , " New York  --  the Tribune . " He drew the paper from his pocket and motioned Murphy to linger . " They wrappedp212my book in it . Look . Her Gracious Majesty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it is reported , assured him .. " Hell and burn !

" To Savanna , Simon said , folding up the Tribune , " Do n't throw it out till I get another copy . " " Throw it out ! " she cried . " This copy is mine ! " She took it from him , folded and refolded it . " Did you react the place where it said Negroes held a convention up North , and another place where it said women held a convention ?

They looked scared and happy . " He stroked her hand . " Do you remember , every night those children come , that you 're a law breaker ? " " Yes . " " Good . Just so long as you do n't grow careless . " She was mighty sure of herself . " The children would n't let me grow careless . I never told them how to creep in here . It must have been Prudence .

Then she said in a soft voice , " I took an oath up in the mountains . I 've got to keep it or my baby wo n't rest easy . " He sat silently , feeling his heart swell . Simon mounted the steps of the white clapboard United States I lotel , and nodded to the Negro at the door . " Tell Mr. Waller Mr. Bliss is here . " " Simon Bliss . Is that Simon Bliss ?

Cyrus Root was a great ,  |p214bearded  man with the dark flush of a whisky drinker , John Taylor was a round , smiling man with sleepy eyes . " If Mr. Waller 's in , I 've come to see him , " Simon answered cautiously . " Reckon he 'll see you . " Hitchcock motioned him into the room .

" Hitchcock was stiff and happy , tugging gently at the loose folds of his cheek , his cold , careful eyes untouched by the warmth pervading his body , the eyes moving from Root back to Simon and not leaving Simon 's face . " This is a bill , Mr. Bliss , which deserves the support of every Southerner who wants to make the South an even finer place to live , " Root boomed happily , and released a button in his waistcoat .

" A bill will be read out of committee , proposing that twenty-five hundred Africans be brought into Georgia as indentured servants . Not slaves , see , sir , but indenturedservants .

" Root 's red cheeks were jolly ; his forehead was sweaty . " Mr. Bliss , " he said , " I was born in the North , but I come down here to make my fortune . I made it . I owe the South a debt I ca n't repay unless I stand up as a Northern man and testify to the South as the best way of life on this earth . Are we going to lose the best way of life in the world by watching foreigners , free laborers from the slums of Europe , pour into the North and build so big a population that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we turn ? I guess I know what you 'll say . This bill . . . " " Mr. Bliss 'll vote right , " Hitchcock said softly , resting his tired head against the back of his chair . " He 's a good Democrat . " He looked through the silence at Simon who still swayed his glass . lowly , dreamily . " We 're depending on the representatives of white counties to support it ; the black county representatives arc set . " " The mountains mean hard times , " Taylor said sharply . " Ip216know . But to see a nigger servant building up a good crop or helpingyou to have as good a life as a planter , that 's .. . Simon put his glass down on the table carefully , the liquor still filling it halfway . " Seems a mighty smart law , " he said , his brown eyes clear . " The mountains sure need help . Seems like they 're forgotten most times . . . " " Never forgotten , " Hitchcock said. . . seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easier for the mountains , " Root was smiling , wiping his forehead with a handkerchief . " Soon as it comes out from committee , we 'll have it on the floor . It 'll seem like a new day for Georgy . " " It calls for a power of thinking , " Simon 's dark brows drew together , " to know what 's best always . " " We 'll count on you , " Hitchcock said , not moving his head from the back of the chair . Simon 's smile was white and winning . " I 'm mighty grateful to be spoken to . A fine , smart bill . " Root put out his hand . Hitchcock came slowly to his feet , his eyes sleepy , the brown locks on his foreheadweary against his white brow . " The Democrats make things work down here , Bliss . Politics is power . You 're a young fellow who could use power . " " I could , for a fact . " " You know how to get it ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Simon 's brown eyes opened wide . " I 'm mighty good at knowing when 's the time to talk and the time to be quiet , sir . " " Thought Billy-boy must have fallen downstairs , " Waller said , standing in the door and holding out his hand . " A whip 's been curlin ' round my legs , teachin ' me to dance . " " Do tell . " Waller was small , compact , and neat ; the ash of hiscigar was disciplined , his stock was spotless , his trouser creases wereimpeccable ; only his finger-tips showed stains of tobacco . " It 's confidential . " Hare laughed.  | " We 're all good party members , " Waller said , sitting back like a cheerful ramrod , his knees crossed . " Overseer Hitchcock is plannin ' to open up the Africa trade again . " " Without I beg your pardon ' to the Constitution ? " " They 're just twisting the Constitution ever so little ; nothin ' to speak of . They mean to open the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Us slaveless fellows 'll be tickled to death and the planters will be able to turn money , hand over fist . " Waller smoked in silence , looking brightly at Hare . Hare 's closed fist lay on the table beside him , and beneath his heavy brows his eyes were needle-points . Simon offered with a tentative grin , " It 'll be the greatest thing that 's happened to Georgy . " " I heard a whisper down- the House , just a whisper , the other clay , " Waller said through his cigar . " What did you say to him , sir ? " Simon examined the toe of a shoe and tried to smooth down the scuffed leather . " I said I thought it was mighty nice of him to rememberus poor men and try to help us out . " " Did he think he could count on you ? " " He sang an awful sweet lullaby , and my eyes begun to nod . " Hare boomed once , and smacked his fist on the table . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finds that you were wide awake . " Simon looked up with a swift smile . " Have n't I got friends ? " Hare 's shaggy brows deflected a smile . " They 're all outcasts , boy , all outcasts . " Simon straightened himself and put his hands in his pockets . " All right . What do we do ? " Waller puffed slowly and cheerfully , his eyes on Hare . " If you or I stood up in the House , Rufe , they 'd walk out . What would hold them in their seats ? " Hare looked at Simon steadily , in silence . Then he said , " Curiosity , maybe . Bliss , here , they 've never heard Bliss . " Excitement tugged at Simon . " We 're not the only ones who 'll fight this bill . Others will want their say . " 1 fare continued to stare at him . " We 'll see . We 'll round up what we can . But be prepared . " Waller smiled brightly . " A man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them hell ? "  | " I 've been waiting . " " On your maiden speech , you should consult Hitchcock over every comma . " " Say ! " Waller turned to Hare . " You talk to Noyes . Ask him what he thinks of Bliss . " " We 'll shape an amendment . " Hare 's great hand pounded against his outspread knees . " An amendment that 'll get the most support . " " We 'll talk again in a day or two , " Waller said , his cigar smokingunheeded between his fingers , his bright eyes turned to Simon . " Be ready . Root may get up before the week is out . " Simon answered , " I 'm ready now . " He stood by the heavy oak table , his knuckles pressed against the top . His heart was pounding ; he felt as if a great wind had blown his head clear of doubt and confusion . He had strength , he had right and might . Waller held out his hand . " We came together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked about it and did n't know it . Think we understand each other , sir ? " Simon pumped his hand and grinned . Day by day , Simon bided with a deadly kind of patience . At night Savanna would say , " Still the same ? " and he would nod with an imposed grimness . Nervousness came and went but patience endured . Finally Hare and Waller gave the word , " It 's coming out on Friday , " and he discussed the commas and the periods of the amendment he would offer . " They 'll try to fight you down , but hold on . Stay on your feet . Do n't yield . Keep standing and keep talking . Do n't answer hecklers . Keep out of a fight . We wo n't be able to swing a vote , but we may be able to mess up their plans . " He spoke to tousled-haired , bright-eyed Meigs of Savannah . " The Governor 's made you a delegate to the Vicksburg Commercial Convention , has n't he , Timmy ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " All right . You 'll vote on industry there , and more mills . I 've got an amendment coming up , Timmy . . . " I 'll vote , " said Meigs . " I do n't forget that day that we talked . " " Good , Timmy . " From his seat in the Hall , Simon could see the members who were present , and the vacant chairs . Of those in the hundred andp219fifty-four seats , how many would go with him ? Day after day he studied them , until his imaginings rang in his head and he believed that he knew their hearts and minds in darkness and light . Each day he looked at Lafayette 's portrait at one end of the Hall , and at Oglethorpe 's at the other , and set himself to believe , cheek resting against hand , in the continuity of human goodness and faith which had the power to survive the pitfalls and bypaths of the false believers . When the day finally came , and Cyrus Root rose to his feet , it seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Root was firm , practical , and eloquent , an impressive figure with his flushed face and his fine brown beard , the slow circular movements of arms and body drawing each man in the hall to his way of thinking. . . the opponents of the institute of slavery can raise no opposition to this system of indenture since it was the custom in our early history to build prosperity on the system of bound service for a stated number of years . The champions of an open slave trade can find in this proposal the solution to their gravest ills , since it encourages the importation of Negro labor and leaves the master free of obligation when the years of service arc over . He need no longer see his profits consumed by aged property , their days of usefulnessended ... " Simon waited , fiddling with his notes , waited while the Yankee voice drew eloquence from common sense and the simplest love of profits . He fiddled with his notes and looked about , from one face to another , and he remembered these faces in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing now , neither interest nor dismay nor appreciation . " The challenges to that institution upon which has been built the glory , power , and culture of the South lie all about us ; enemies wait to leap at our throat ; the ways of living which we cherish and for which we would give the last drop of our blood are held to mockery and wrath by a rising colossuswhich desires , for its own vainglory , to bleed our lifeblood from us . This bill which I offer . . . " Simon rested his head against his hand once more , and half dosed his eyes . His young face was passive . He was listening hard , not so much to Root as to the unspoken answers about him . Readingthoughts should not be hard , given cause and effect . Any skillfulpolitician should be able to read thoughts . " ... the merits ofp220this bill are evident . As good Southerners we have never failed to support the claims of our institutions . Wherefore . . . Simon waited . Let one voice rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no use giving himself more to fight than he needed . " Mr. Speaker , why twenty-five hundred ? " " Twenty-five hundred 's a wedge . Go slow and easy , and in a year the slave tradc 'll be open wide . " Simon watched Root 's wet brow and mopping handkerchief with a pursed-lip pleasure . A voice called , " Indentured means free niggers sooner or later . We 've got no use for rovin ' free blacks killin ' white men , attackin ' white women . . . Root 's voice was a trumpet , " Mr. Speaker , that is n't the question , we 've always handled our free blacks  --  they 'd rather be enslaved  --  it'sthe bigger question of getting fresh blacks into Georgy , whether you call ' em indentured or slaves . That 's the point . Our population 's dwindling . We 've got to weigh this bill well and not miss a chance to mend the fences that Federal law has broken down . " Simon 's heart pounded . He looked around him swiftly , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I want to offer an amendment to this fine bill by Mr. Root . . . " " Out of order ! " " Speaker rules . . . " Simon said clearly , placatingly , " I 'm not out of order . If I offer an amendment , it must be heard . " " Out of order ! " Andrew Waller was on his feet . " The rules say particularly that an amendment must be heard . Do n't forget your duty , . Mr. Speaker ! " The Speaker snapped , " I know my duty . Representative from Gilmer has the floor . " " For every twenty-five hundred indentured blacks introduced into the state of Georgia , I ask the Legislature to provide employmentfor twenty-five hundred unemployed white men at suitable work with suitable gain . . . " Simon 's ears informed him that the roars were scattered . Many sat quiet . His brown eyes swept the hall swiftly , and he lifted his voice to a shout . " If I have a second for this amendment , I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice was shrill . " Second it ! "  | " Since only one out of ten Georgians hold slaves , I want to know who this bill is intended for ? Reckon Mr. Root will say it 's for the trine-tenths so that they can hold slaves , only he calls them indenturedservants . But why do they want to pay for indentured upkeepwhen they 've got more need to look out for themselves ? " lie waited for the catcalls to subside and looked down at Murphywho was holding his head and making sounds like a man in distress . With the tip of his shoe he poked at Murphy and grinned , but Murphy did not grin in return . Simon waited for a moment , took a breath , and shouted , " Georgia 's the keystone of the South . She 's got everything to make her citizens prosperous . Why are n't they ? That 's . . . Ca n't hear , " he said to himself with a grin . " You all talk too loud . " He heard Hare 's roar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " but the gavel did not sound . He wound himself up once again . " Rich folks have n't any need for the poor white man because they 've got their own slaves . But somebody 's got to stand here and speak up for that poor white . I reckon there are lots of your here who can do it , and I 'd be mighty thankful to hear your ayes when this is over . Some of you call poor white folks trash . If they have n't any work to do and get lazy , sure they 're trash . But it does n't need to be so . Twenty-five hundred white men put to work would n't be much , but it would help . " " What would they do  --  niggers ' work ? " " What 's niggers ' work ? What every one of us has done who does n't hold slaves . That does n't scare me , and I reckon it would n't si are a poor white man who sees his family starving ! " le wondered how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been emptied . Against the wood of others a wild rat-a-tatt.itwas beating which was more effective than the cries . " Why should n't the South manufacture , and employ men at wages ? Why should she go to the North for everything ? " ( What were Helper 's figures ? He tried to remember . Reckoned he did n't treed them , though , for figures would never be heard . ) " Yield , Bliss , for debate ! " " I 'll not yield ! I have n't much use for men who ca n't work with their own two hands  --  who need a black man to do every lick forthem !  --  Behind him he heard the angry cry of Richard Voss , representalivefrom Talbot County.  | " He 's a damn Abolitionist ! Mr. Speaker , he loses the right to speak ! " " Have I said anything against slavery ? I 'm talking about employment , employment of the labor we 've got at hand . " " White men 'd liefer die ! " a great shout went up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Against the desks the rat-a-tat-tat broke out with fresh vigor , men shouted for recognition , members shouted angrily at members , rattling canes against desks to earn attention . Across the hall , Waller was on his feet . " Order , Mr. Speaker ! Throw these hoodlums out ! " Now Simon stood against his chair , patient as a tree , one leg crossed over the other , a grin upon his face which came with the shouts and cries and the feverishness of battle . Their breath would run out while he stored his . He waited and again he leaped . " If Georgia 's the most up-to-date state in the South , let 's keep her so . Georgia 's all ready for the work that white men can do , and I reckon it 's time those nine-tenths had a say . " A hand snatched at Simon , but he shook it off . Someone across the hall was shouting , " Boycott the North ! No more buying from the North ! He 's right . Question ! " Simon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Across the House he saw Hare moving swiftly from one member to another , and Waller leaning backward in his seat to talk with those behind him . He leaned forward to Murphy , " When ought the question to come ? " Murphy growled angrily , " Asking me ? I 'm not in on this damn foolishness . " " Are you going to vote right ? " " Well , I ca n't vote with those holy rollers , can I ? " Simon 's voice rose across the bedlam . " A genuine , clear-cut provisionfor Georgia industrialism would hurry up the building of our railroads , strengthen our banks , lower our taxes , cut the cost of shippin ' from distant parts . . . Across the House a tall lean member shouted with hysterical good humor , " I move that we offer a ten thousand dollar reward to anybody who imports twenty-five hundred Abolitionists from the North and sets ' em to work . " The drone of systematic cries drove men from the House . Simon'seyes , growing hard , saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stairs . Votes were walking out . Root , unbuttoninghis waistcoat , had lifted himself up by his shaking fist . " The man 's an Abolitionist , " he cried , " that Bliss is an Abo-litionist ! " " A goddamn Abolitionist ! " Voss shrilled from behind . " Cane Rini ! " Root outshouted the storm . " He 's talking abolitionist dogma . We know what brought Georgia prosperity . Nobody dares teach us . Who is n't satisfied with Georgia prosperity ? Who is n't satisfied with the mighty abundance of the Keystone State ? " Simon shifted from one foot to the other . He saw Hitchcock on the floor , counseling , whispering . His face was sallow ; the locks of brown hair dragged across his forehead . Other party leaders he saw were writing notes , going from desk to desk . Simon leaned his elbows on the back of his chair and roared . " Mr. Speaker , I did not yield ! The gentleman is out of order . I 'll have my say and sit down . There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Murphy jumped up . " Look out ! They 're talkin ' with sticks ! " Simon felt his arm seized from behind , the back of his knee struck . He swung his free arm in a savage arc and kicked as he spun around . " Try other tactics ! " he cried . " Those are old stuff to me ! " and watched Voss stumble , roll , lie at the foot of the steps , breathing hard . " Are you afraid of words ? " he roared at the House . " Do you have to kick men from behind because you 're scared ? Get up , Voss , and tell your constituents what a fine feller you are ! " Voss rose to his knees and friends helped him to his feet , his long , silky hair tumbled , his eyes blind with rage . " I 'm willing for the questionif you 'll make it a choice between the right to speak and the danger of being attacked from behind ! " Voices called for the question , and Simon listened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The ayes might have it  --  they were no thinner than the nays  --  but the Speaker struck his gavel . " Amendment lost . Discussion on the main motion . " He sank into his seat , suddenly weary , his muscles tired . He had not realized how much of the strain of this kind of fighting was borne by his body . He put his hand across his forehead and jabbed his knife into his desk . So he had made his maiden speech and stirred the wrath of hell . le did not know whether he expected anything else . He heardp224none of the debate ; he sat in his seat because he was too bound by his thoughts to move . The fight stretched out behind him , beyond his memory ; it stretched into the future , perhaps beyond his knowledgealso . He stood at this point , bruised and tired . Yet exultant . He realized this suddenly , behind the darkness of his concealing hand . Exultant . He was a part of the fight now . When he had stood up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plunged into the current , and forever after he would be swimming like a shipwrecked man toward the future . He laughed a little , low in his throat , and took his hand down from his eyes . Murphy was standing up . " Like it here too much to leave ? " Murphy asked . " They 've recessed ? " " That 's right . " He laughed again , and lifted himself to his feet . " Did I vote on anything ? " Murphy grunted . " The odds were n't swinging right for Hitchcock . They 'll be voting later . " They went toward the door in silence , Simon 's head lowered , thinking still of the shape of past and present , and of the future as a thing to be greatly loved . At the stairs he stepped aside for Murphy to go down first , for Murphy was sore and angry , and he did not want that gnarled fierce hand trailing the banisters after him . Hare stood in the hall below , with Waller . Hare looked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaggy brows . " You 're not near as bruised as you might have been , " he said in his heavy voice . " On the whole , not bad . Better treatment than we 'd have gotten , Waller or I. " Waller grimaced . " Hitchcock and Root 'll be too busy to have any dinner today . That ought to make us feel better . Reckon they 'll round up a vote by afternoon , but it wo n't be an easy vote . " Hare put his hand on Simon 's shoulder . " It shakes ' em hard each time a thing like this happens . One day , we 'll shake them loose . " Murphy jerked his thumb at Simon . " He hands out free drinks when you vote right . Remind him . " Simon nursed his wonderment as they came onto the terrace underthe lowering sky . lie marveled that men spoke so many words and nourished so many different thoughts . That fellow Voss had hit him because he did not like what he said , because he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own interests . Hep225had heard tell they did the same thing in the United States Congress . God Almighty ! A Massachusetts Senator had been clubbed nigh to death by a South Carolinian two years before . Heard tell folks carried pistols in the Halls of Congress and men bared their breasts and hollered at other men to shoot . He remembered that Aleck Stephens got nigh stabbed to death by an angry politician . Ile whistled . He 'd talk a thing out with a man any time , any time . I le 'd speed the day when men reasoned together . He marveled , as he looked up at the storm-filling sky , at his hatred of bloodshed , at the way his mind and spirit turned from violence . What must be , must be , but not when men had a chance to reason together . He did not want drinks of any kind . He stood in the Keystone Hotel 's dining room and looked at the three men sitting at the table . From his pocket he drew some silver and laid it on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine for me . I 'm going home . " He raised his hand and left before they answered him . He walked with his hands in his pockets , studying the dirt street , wondering , marveling , with a fierce new anger . He knew what he believed ; he would die for what he believed , but let life mold him and toughen him and make him a strong advocate , and bit by bit , as time moved out of the past , and men caught up with the present , and moved into the future , the living , breathing passion for free men and abundant life would not be his fire alone , or the fire of u few souls , but the consuming truth by which men lighted their hopes and destroyed their fears . He walked down Wilkinson Street , his head lowered . He did not ice Voss standing at the corner of Green Street until a cane struck in rocs his shoulders . A rush of angry blood filled Simon 's eyes , and instinctively he put up his hands and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it struck the air with a second blow . He grappledwith the tall thin man who raised it a third time , and he caught his thumb and bent it back till the stick dropped . " I lit him with your fist ! " Voss was crying , but Simon held the slick like a cudgel . Simon looked at the silky , long hair of Voss and the violet eyes , and dismay came upon him . " Listen , " he said , a feeling of sudden helplessness within him , the helplessness of a man who wants to laugh , but can not laugh , told dares not explain the reason why . " Listen . . . " Then he sank onto the step of the house , his hands around the cudgel , and laughed after all , very softly , shaking his head , looking away fromp226Voss and the impotent assailant . " Ca n't you do your fighting , front on ? " " If you were a gentleman , I 'd have fought you myself with pistols . But you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was his long hair and violet eyes which gave him the appearance of youth . Simon tapped the end of the cudgel softly against the steps . " If I were a gentleman , I still would n't fight you with pistols . I 'd put up my fists and take you on like a man  --  as soon as your thin pal had been paid off and was out of the way . " He stood up , and Voss made a movement forward . Simon swung on his heels . " Shall I fight you here ? Will that satisfy you ? " Dull red crept into Voss ' face and he said with a savage intensity , " There are ways of settling men like you  --  fitting ways . " " Men like me . . . " said Simon wonderingly . Then he cried , with sudden urgency in his voice , " Wake up , man . Just wake up ! This is 1859 . You 'll get left behind ! " " You 're trash ! " Voss cried in a high , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of passion . " No whipping 's good enough for white trash ! " Simon buttoned his waistcoat neatly , the cudgel pressed against his side under his arm ; then he brushed the skirts of his coat . " You came up behind me , " he said mildly . " You tried to get me in the knee and break my arm . Next time I 'll remember that that 's the way some men fight . " He looked off down the street as if he were alone . Then he tipped his hat without looking at them , and swinging the stick slightly , walked away , neither hurriedly nor slowly , simply at the gait of a man returning home . But he did not return home . Anger mounted , slow and heavy  --  mounted and burned and possessed him . He continued walking , past Green Street , walking relentlessly , a man who would stop for nothing till his anger had burned itself out . The lowering sky opened , large drops of rain fell on his wide hat and his shoulders . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' men . The beating of the rain was like vengeance . He had used the legal weapons of combat , and they had struck at him from behind . Bide awhile , he said  --  but for how long ! He came to the edge of the town . Rain was gathering like mist across the desolate plantation land . Yet he was unaware of the rain as anything outside his dark anger . He instinctively crouched low ,  |p227not  slowing his pace . Slave cabins cowered , and smoke was beaten back into chimneys . Bow your head . . . see no evil . . . wait for the day to come and stumble in waiting . . . Do n't strike  --  wait ! And anger will die , and old age will claim you . Bones will grow brittle and death will overtake you . He had turned up a hillock , his tense eyes drawn to the black trunk of a dead willow against the sky . Two dead arms were lifted , fists shaken at the sky , a thing stripped of all but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would stand there . He put his hand up against the tree , anger searching for direction . He saw below the blurred shape of the fields , where the old plantation house and the slave cabins crouched low . High on the hill , he I. Hew his sap had not gone into the earth . He lifted the cudgel . By God , " he shouted , " I 'm not dead . Watch out . Just watch outwhen I come ! "  |p228WHEN  SIMON CAME ONTO THE TERRACE THE NEXT EVENING AND LEANEDagainst the stone fretwork , Alston came and stood , with his back to the stone , facing him . " We won the vote after all , sir , " he said , his upper lip rippling faintly in a smile . " You got a good fight for your money first , " Simon answered evenly , not looking at Alston . " Why do n't you fight on the right side ? You 're good . " Simon grinned . " I am on the right side . " " You 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth smiling . " There are worse things than losing . " " Are there ? What , sir ? " Simon looked up at him with a sudden , warm smile . " Winning , sometimes . " Alston pushed himself away from the fretwork and went down the steps . Simon found him still standing there when he passed a while later . Michael looked at him with wry , thrusting curiosity , his young eyes sharp behind their heavy lines . " Bliss , I hear Voss waylaid you . " Simon asked pleasantly , " Is that your business ? " Michael smiled , his eyes droop-lidded . " In a way . " Then he came and walked beside Simon , who had shown no signs of lingering . " In a way . " They walked side by side in silence , two young men of commensurate bulk and height , with an unnaturalness lying between them , unnaturalness growing with their steps , young men mindful of alertness , uneasiness . Alston said , with a sliding , side glance , " Voss was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through my mind to fight you , and then I thought that I would wait  --  you 'd probably need a licking more a little later . " Simon went on in silence , his brow dark , his mind moving slowly . Mountain men hated the cotton lords . Let it remain there . Let it go no farther than the hatred of one breed for another.  |p229Alston  said , " I reckon maybe you could have nicked Voss . I hear tell mountaineers are good shots . " " Hear tell , " Simon answered , his eyes growing small with an anger which sprang out of time and related itself unevenly to Michael 's words . " I would n't mind if you had given him a licking with his own cudgel , " Alston said amiably , and then , " Do you know why ? " Simon grunted . " Because a good fight is a good fight , and it does n't matter who wins this time or the next time , for the end 's sure . The end 's sure , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cautious . He wished no argument . Michael went on without antagonism , almost gaily , " And why 's the end sure ? Do n't you want to know , sir ? " " You 've got a mighty big think about that end . It 'd be a powerfulgrief if you were n't right . " " Not right ? " said Michael softly . " Some things are as plain as God 's right hand . " Michael Alston was his enemy . . . his enemy . He continued to walk beside Alston , held by a quick and sharpened tenseness . " Not right , " Michael still said . " Do n't you think men can make things right if they set their wills to it ? " Simon laughed . " You would n't mess up things with fine words ? " Michael half closed his eyes and smiled his thin rippling smile . " No . I 'd never do that . " He laughed as if to himself , a little insultingand arrogant . " I do n't need fine words . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the worst comes , you 'll fight our battles for us , for you wo n't have a choice . " Simon answered with a slow painful softness . " You 're talkin ' about a thing as big as the North and the South , are n't you ? " He waited . " Eh ? " Michael replied with a half laugh . " I 'm talking about getting what we want and need , any time , every time , sir . " " That 's the same thing . You 'll need our votes for it , votes of the men who hate your guts . " " Hate our guts ? No , they do n't . We count on them . " His head moved back until his long , tawny hair rested against his velvet collar . " But I 'd never get your vote , would I , Bliss , for any amount of trying ? Then why do I care ? " " I 'm wondering , " Simon answered.  |p230Michael  looked at him frankly . " You 're good , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ havoc with the vote yesterday . " " We 'll do it again . " " Why ? Now , why ? Southern men must stick together  --  there 's no choice . " " Up in my mountains they do n't hanker after the State government . It 's the Federal government they like . They 're Union men , not Georgy men . " " The Union 's nothin ' but the Federal government . The whole country has voted Southern slavery for half a century  --  elected the Federal government . Go back and tell your mountain fellows that . They 're votin ' for us when they vote for the Federal government . " He stopped in front of a saloon . Simon had no answer that made sense . If he knew about things with certainty , he 'd have a heap of answers . He looked away up the red dirt road . To turn the things he hated to his own use was to nullify them . He put his hand on the door of the saloon , and tacitly , without words , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large body into a chair . " You 've never been out of Georgia , have you , mountaineer ? " " You aim to make something of that ? " " Certainly . I know the North . I know it like the back of my hand . I 've known it since I was ten years old and went there to school . I was a mighty fine investment to the North for twelve years . They could n't do enough for me , they could n't do one thing too much . " He leaned across the table with a sly pleasure . " I 've seen Northern factories and Northern workers , Northern slums and Northern poverty , I 've talked to Northern bankers and Northern shipping men , I 've marched in workers ' parades with a red flag in front of me  --  a red flag , mind you  --  I 've run with a pack of Irish hunting down nigners , I 've confessed my sins at one Abolitionist meeting , and broken up another . I know who rules and who 's on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best drinking terms with every Northern man of Southern principles in Congress , and I know the odds . Sir , the North belongs to the South . " Simon felt cold . He was not drinking today . Not with Alston . " New York 's a Southern city , " Michael 's amiable , drawling voice went on . " Every paving stone , every broker 's office belongs to us . The North ca n't live without New England , and unless we feed New England cotton , she 'll die . As long as we 've got cotton , wep231have the world by the tail because the North ca n't live without it and cotton would bring Europe in on our side . " . Simon looked at Michael 's second glass of whisky ; traced with his eyes the ridge of dark liquid ; watched it flow toward Michael 's mouth as he raised it to his lips . Words were air . He stiffened himself . Heap up a few more facts , just a few more .. . Michael 's voice was dreamy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Simon . " We 'll make the South a great confederation . The country will expand on the basis of Southern not Northern culture . We 'll build up big ports , and tell Northern ports and railroadsto go to hell . We 'll build our own factories and industries ... we 'll make our own toothpicks . " He looked at Simon with his swift , insulting smile . " I could show you how to make money ; I 've made a heap . If we had railroads we could win the West . If we won the West . . . " You 've lost the West . " Simon was curt and sharp . Alston looked up at him slowly and continued to look at him for some time before he answered with a pleasant deadliness , " We could get the whole world if we wanted it . Remember that  --  everything in it . " " Americans fought tyrants before . I reckon they 'd fight them and slavery if you gave the word . " Alston raised his glass toward his mouth , " So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was something cold as death , as pleasant as sin . Simon kicked his heel against his shin in anger at himself and searched in his mind for an answer . He said with a long , slow look , and a deepened drawl , " Mountaineers are ornery folks . They hold tight to the things their grandpaps believed in . Grandpaps ( lid not hold with slavery . " Michael answered , heavy-eyed and whisky-smiling , " One day it will be treason to say that . I might remember . " " In the United States ? " Simon leaned back in his chair , his dark brows drawn together , his eyes like agates . " In the land of liberty . " Alston leaned across the table , smiling . " We 'll make it a good country , fellow , ruled by gentlemen . " " Like you ? " Michael stroked the sleeve of his coat and clasped his hands about his glass before he answered . " Like me . And you  --  you 'll be owned by me . " His eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved in exas/peration . " We 'll end economic cannibalism . We 'll put an end to exploitation . " " We ? " Michael laughed softly and scornfully . " Not you and I , my man . I  --  and mine . We 'll have socialism . It 's time for a change . Not socialismby foreign agitators . It will be American Southern socialism . We 'll abolish competition , we 'll establish a community of property and unity of labor . We 'll go beyond black slavery , which is only the first phase . " He rested his head upon his hand , and now there was no hint of a smile . He contemplated Simon with sharpened eyes . " One race and one class only has been brought into that unity of labor . That 's not enough for full productivity . " " You use mighty big words when you 're drunk . " " Drunk . . . " He went on laughing . " We will hold vast acres for ourselves and our sons and bind to us forever and ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Reckon that scheme gets you votes from the poor men . " He reckoned this man would be wiped out , one day , wiped clean off the earth . Time would catch up with him , the world would turn . Alston was not aware that Simon had spoken . " Upon the great republicanism of slave Greece , we 'll found our new order and we 'll rule for a million years . " He considered Simon with a heavy-lidded pleasure . " Dirt-eaters and backwoodsmen will find their proper place . And I will own your irresistible wife . " For a moment Simon did not understand . Then he sat large and quiet , hatred burning him as it had never done before . His hands gripped the ledge of the table out of sight , and every muscle in his body ached . He 'd kill Alston one day , but not now . Now he was weak with hatred ; the muscles in his thighs and arms were trembling . His hands groped against the table and he stood up . Alston watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and came slowly to his feet with a little smile , swinging his chair from him . Simon moved , but he did not move toward Michael . Simon made a quick gesture , lunging against the table . It toppled at Alston'sfeet , drenching his trousers with whisky , catching his foot under its weight . Then Simon went toward the door , and the walls quivered as he slammed it behind him . Later , much later , he stood on the steps of his home , looking down , away to the shining Oconee . He stood thus for some time , commanding stillness to possess him . His brow and hands were wetp233although the air was cool . Savanna , seeing him from the window , opened the door , and he turned and for a long time gazed at her , his eyes silencing the greeting on her lips . Then he came up the steps , and took her in his arms , and held her closer than his heart , stroking her hair , saying no word . Spring was here . It came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but presentlyit filled the dry branches of the trees . In the front yards of fine houses magnolias bloomed by the broad steps , and the faint beginnings of honeysuckle crept into the air . By the Governor 's Mansion , rose bushes grew glossy and shrubs swelled and grew fat . The dust lay quiet beneath the spring rain , and when the rains ceased the sun drew up the dust again in red clouds . Black folks walked on the business of masters with a spring look in their eyes . Songs came in the throat . Sometimes they were sung ; sometimes they were not . Everyone understood the same things in springtime . Sometimes they acknowledged this ; sometimes they did not . Black men could look at white men , and white women at black women , and they could all know what the other was thinking . Carriage tops were lowered . Ladies rode with parasols , in muslincrinolines under cloaks , holding damp handkerchiefs to their noses to keep out the dust . By watching , one could see the Governor , in woolen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was adorned by white pillars , search with his eyes for the home of his youth in the blue hills , and imagine the " humph " that came once iii his throat as he motioned a black boy to follow his pole-like figure down the steps . Wherever one cared to look , one could see the broad-brimmed hats or shiny stovepipes of elder and younger statesmen held against the body by an arm , shadbelly coats drawn back to show great and shiny watch fobs which enabled time to be held in the hand . Beyond the Cemetery , black children played . Ivy flowed over the penitentiary walls . In the Oconee , fish flung themselvesback and forth like light , and green flies floated debonairly on the water . One had faith , one believed , there was hope . Near the post office , Simon met Michael Alston . They looked at one another in silence ( or a moment . Then Simon said with a half smile , " The Senate defeated you after all . You did not win that vote . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes looking beyond Si/mon , his large , white hand smoothing his tawny hair . " Only two nays . " " Two are all we need , " Simon said , " to begin on . " Then he stood alone in the village street , looking after Michael 's blue coat , finally lifting his eyes beyond the roof-tops . A hundred miles and a little more , the mountains rose out of the piedmont . Spring would be in the mountains , the young owls crying . His own lambs would be stumbling up his green field . Spring was in the mountains , and seeds in the ground . Already the thin red earth was yielding to the growing seeds . But he would not see the mountains in their spring . He had other things in mind . Prudence stood in the porch doorway . Simon was holding his wife 's hand in the darkness , and the sweet scent of honeysuckle shut them into the warm night . Prudence stood silent till one of them spoke to her . The light from the room behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man sez I owe ' nother thirty dollars fer Willie . " Her voice was heavy and slurred . " Did n't you pay him the twenty-five dollars we agreed on ? " " Yes , sir . " She shifted and her voice was black and sad . " Do n't make no diff'rence . . . " He spoke sharply out of the darkness . " We have it in writing . " " Yes , sir . He cai n't read . " Savanna stirred and Simon rose and came into the light of the doorway . " By God , Prudence , I 'll teach him . I 'll make him spell with his nose ! " Her black eyes stared at him , and she pressed her lips together to shut back a smile . A black hand had reached out weeks ago to test him . Standing in the doorway now , sharing her troubles with h:m , Prudence was saying " Thank you , " in the only way that she knew . " Willie thought las ' time he wuz comin ' home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He went by the rising moon down the road . Walt Bye was held by the law . He might twist the law and torment the law , but he could not creep out of the law . Simon would take Willie by the hand this very night and bring him to Prudence . The law was the law . Even Georgia justice said that . He walked past the edge of town , to the fiat desolate landp235where the plantations lay . Walt Bye had said , " Yes , sir , " when he heard that he was a lawyer , and they had drunk a mug of whisky together . Willie was worth three hundred dollars , and all but twenty-five had been paid . . . That 's what Bye said . He said the nigger had lied if she said he had asked a hundred more . The boy was n't worth it . . . Walt Bye sat on his front porch in the sweet-smelling darkness . Peering into the night he said , " Who 's there ? " " It 's Simon Bliss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge of the porch . " Just a talk , Mr. Bye . Fine night . " Bye did not answer . Simon could hear the rocker creaking , and see a shoe when the rocking brought it into the moonlight . " Set , " said Bye . " No call for staying long , " Simon said , lowering himself to the edge of the porch . " Have a plug of tobaccy ? " The rocking paused . " I come out to fetch Willie for the free woman , Prudence Walker . She seems mixed up again . I said I 'd fetch Willie and straighten it out . " The rocking resumed but was slower ; the shoe shifted so that the moonlight caught only its tip . Simon waited , his head against the post , looking into the darkness where Bye sat . " Will you shout him up , Mr. Bye , so I can be on my way ? " The rocking was normal again ; a soft slob of tobacco juice struck the ground near Simon 's feet . The voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it . " Simon did not answer for a moment . Then he knocked out his pipe . " I do n't seem to understand , " he said , " I 've got something in writing . " The two shoes came together in the moonlight , side by side on the porch . " I 've got a respect for writin ' , " the soft voice admitted , " but only tome kinds . Seems I needed three hundred dollars , and writin ' were n't money . " Simon was on his feet . His voice cut through the darkness . " Where 's Willie ? " The rocker scraped back . The two feet strained as Bye rose . " Cai n't rightly say , Mister . The dealers were bound for Mobile . " Simon sprang to the porch and reached through the dark . He caught Bye by his shirt and his galluses and dragged him into the moonlight  | " Speak clear ! What are you saying ! " " I needed three hundred dollars mighty bad , Mister . Willie fetched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His hands ripped at Bye 's shirt . " Hey , lay off , Mister ! " Simon 's head was congested . He held with one hand and struck with the other . He held and struck again . Bye cried out faintly , " Hey , Mister ! " Simon let him fall to the ground . " By God , I 'll have the law ... 1 " Bye , in the pale light , nursed his sore jaw . A faint smile curled his cut lip . " No , Mister , " he said , " not the law . The law 'd want a receipt for that last twenty-five dollars . That nigger woman ai n't got one . " Simon 's arms tightened . He lunged forward . Bye scrambled to his feet . " Watch out for the law yer own self , Mister  --  hit me again . " Simon struck with his leg and caught him in the groin . " God damn ... 1 " " God damn your soul ! " Simon shouted . " I 'll kill you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Bye ran and Simon heard the bolt of the door flung into place . " God damn you ! " Simon shouted , and picked up a stone . " I 'll make me a law ! " He flung the stone and heard the splintering of glass . " So help me , God Almighty , I 'll make a law ! " From the house a shot rattled . The road was stark moonlight . He stumbled as he turned onto the road . He knelt where he was for a moment , his head in his hands . The still night denied him identity , passed him for a shadow on the still road . He rose , went on , his feet pounding slow . Unspokenwords choked him . He shook his head , and found himself crying like a child . His feet tripped and stumbled and went on , pounding steady and faster , along the path laid by the moonlight . ... The scent of honeysuckle dreamed on the still warm air . Savanna , leaning against the steps of the veranda , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart was swelling with a continuing joy , a joy which was not identified by common phrases , a joy which simply said , " One step here , one there  --  we 're on our way ! Prudence , sitting on a chair against the wall of her unlighted kitchen , smelled the fragrance , but her eyes were listening with her ears into the darkness .  |p237They  heard the slow footsteps down the street . Prudence , in the darkness , slowly clasped her great hands . Savanna ran to the gate . He looked at Savanna , but opened the gate and passed her without a word . Beside the veranda , the moonlight made a filigree of honeysuckle , and the faint wind stirred the air with scent . He did not go up the steps , and Savanna put her hand through his arm . " There 's no boy ? " she asked , disbelief in her voice . " No boy . " " Oh , my dear God . " Her head sank against his sleeve , and her fingers bruised his arm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flush of light made Savanna 's fingers quiver and Simon 's breath grow still . Presentlyshe went up the steps , drawing him by the hand . Prudence still sat on her chair by the kitchen wall , and only her black eyes moved when Simon stood in the door . Her powerful hands were still , but the skin stretched taut and yellow over the knuckles . He hoped passionately that silence would transform his words ; he clung to silence . Prudence 's eyes looked at him , looked beyond him through the door , and then returned to his face with a naked demand . He clung to silence , agony pounding with the blood at his heart . It was Savanna who said , " Prudence . . . Prudence 's eyes slipped down , past his face , past the hand in his pocket , past his dust-covered shoes . The rivers in her face deepened . She nodded slowly . She did not raise her eyes , nor did she unclaspher hands . Into the pool of light came the moths which floated through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mosquitoes droned against the shadowed ceiling , and the scent of honeysuckle was a dream . Simon came and sat against the table by the lamp , his eyes lowered . " Prudence . . . " Ai n't no mo'e words . " With her silence , silence fell on him . Far off across the fields a clog wailed and another answered . " Prudence , " he said softly at length , " I 'm finished with words too . I 'm finished  --  forever and ever . " She gave no sign ; only a heavy worn shoe shuffled forward slowly and was still . The rivers of her face carried no tears ; no light burned behind the yellow eyeballs . The great knuckled fingers opened once without volition and closed again . " Prudence , when one road is blocked , we must find another . "  |p238The  white kerchief on her head stirred faintly in the breeze ; a quiver passed across her lips . " Prudence . . . He spoke against the flickering light of the lamp , while the moon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke against the circle of dogs barking yonder in the field , answering from the town . He spoke without heeding the mosquitoes which sang softly around his head . " You 've got no more to lose , Prudence . And I 've got no more to gain . Are we going to find another road ? " Her eyes remained unblinking , but passion came to ease her mouth . " Prudence , I 've bided patient for too long  --  too long ! " His great hand covered his face and he whispered a shout , " Tell me what to do and I 'll help blow slavery to hell ! " The great black eyes turned to him and light swam in the rivers of her face . " Me ? " she groaned . " What-for a white man ast me ? " The great knuckled hands grasped her knees convulsively . " I ca n't learn any more from white folks , Prudence . " Her body swayed . " God Almighty , Prudence . . . 1 " Her body swayed faster.  |p239TWO  NIGHTS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , heard a step passing to the kitchen door . Simon lifted his head , but did not lose the place in his book . A few minutes later , Prudencestood in the door , silent for a moment , her arms folded . " Jake Thompson 's here , " she said . " He wants t ' see ye . " " Jake Thompson ? " " He 's a friend of mine . " Simon put down his book slowly and looked at Prudence . Her head was high and stiff ; when Simon looked at her , her eyes half closed . He felt a sudden violent excitement tingle his scalp . " Bring him in . " " In here ? " " In here . " She went out abruptly , the flap of her loose shoes sounding down the corridor . Savanna laid her sewing in her lap . The gleam in her eyes asked a question . Simon wiped his hot hands on his handkerchief and answered as if she had spoken aloud . " Maybe . Maybe ! " He went to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . He stood briefly looking out through a closed shutter , his face and mouth and brow wiped suddenly clean of expression , only his mind piercing the opacity to the dark night . He looked back at her swiftly . " Savanna . . . " Excitement stifled his voice . I le heard the flap of soft shoes coming once more down the corridor , and watched Prudence come through the door , gaunt and tall . They did not see her friend for a moment , for she was taller than he . Then she stepped back and said , " This is him . " He was dark brown and middle-aged . His hair was grizzled , his body strong and disproportionate in bulk , the back twisted into a slight hump , the strong upper torso overbalancing the short legs . Simon looked into his face as he held out his hand . The face was a power ; withdrawn , behind his bright eyes , something waited and watched.  | " My wife , " Simon said briefly , and then he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thompson sat down slowly , a torn straw hat covering his shabby knees . Simon was aware of a faint smile behind his lips and a quick up-and-down of himself and Savanna . The voice , when he spoke , was soft and disarming . " I 'm in a heap of trouble , mas'r . Prue done think mebbe you cud tell me how t ' make out . " Simon did not answer for a moment . Then he said , " What 's the trouble ? " " Prue sez you 're a lawyer . " " That 's right . " " I ai n't never seen nothin ' but the law , so I cai n't tell how to make it stop . " " There 's law and law . " " That 's right . That 's what I done tell my wife .

They got to learn from white genmun things like stoppin ' the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair tilted back . The hands in his pockets were waiting , the tone of his voice was waiting , there was a waiting vigilance in his eyes . " Has someone been giving you a shove ? " " A shove ? Dat 's right . A powerful shove . " The merry , ingenuous eyes which had been moving from boot tip to boot tip went slowly to Simon 's face . " You did n't shove back ? " The light iii the eyes seemed to narrow . " Shove back , mas'r ? Me ? " Simon and his chair swayed ever so slightly . " A black man , " he said thoughtfully , " has plenty of shove . " He waited , watching . Those black eyes had never been merry , he decided . The sambosmilewas a trick . Ile felt a coldness mount up in him , not the coldnessof apprehension , but the coldness which comes when the familiaris suddenly revealed as the unknown . He waited . In the presence of the strange and unknown , he waited for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mas'r , " the slight , soft voice answered . " Most everybody in Milledgeville say , Jake 's a good boy . Never give no trouble . ' That 's why I cai n't nohow figger how I cud 've broke the law . "  |p241Simon  did not answer for a moment . He glanced across at Savanna , whose needle moved perfunctorily . " Your master says so ? " The merry eyes shot upward from the frayed hat . " Ai n't got no master . I bought ma-self . " Simon tipped his chair back so that a shadow fell across his face . " Free Negroes do n't always mind themselves the way the law says . " " Mas'r , this black man does . Mas'r , this what they done say . They done say that Jake Thompson who cai n't read nor write nohow , whistles up Toms , Dicks , and Harrys and reads ' em newspapers and tells ' em things they mas'rs would shoot ' em fer knowin ' . Now , Mas'r Bliss , that 's the biggest lie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

He cud hear what de Book say , ' membered out of my mam 's hail . " The heat was oppressive . Simon watched the sweat form on Jake Thompson 's forehead , and put up a sleeve to dry his own brow . " You want law-words from me ? " " Wud be handy , mas'r . " " Then I 'll say to you , Watch four ways at once . ' I 'll say to anyone who prefers charges against you , ' All Jake Thompson and I want is proof . ' We 'll surrender to proof but to nothing else .

Presently he said , the little smile appearing from behind his lips , " You cud tell which wuz which , mas'r ?

Same as they 's one kind of prayin ' and another kind of prayin ' , and one kind of chapter and verse and another kind .

" Does that there Bible of yours teach topography as well ? " " Do n't rightly know , mas'r . Cai n't always say what it teaches . " " Could it teach me some things that are n't in law books ? " The gay , hard eyes went to Savanna first , as if measuring theunknown , and she looked at him and faintly smiled . He did notsmile , his eyes returned slowly to Simon . " Me teach a white genmun ? That do n't make sense . " " Black men are slaves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scratched his thumb along the brim of his straw hat .

If they 're hiding Josh Jones in a swamp I 'd like to know it . If they 're on a road to the North it 'd be nice to knowp244it . " And she answered , " I guess the first thing you learn about this business is that you save your questions . " But this did not touch Simon 's restlessness . He went the next day to buy a sack of feed for a horse which did not exist , because Jake Thompson was a porter in the store and would be obliged to carry it for him . Simon walked ahead of him down the busy trading street , but when they came to Green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowed his pace so that he walked only a step or two ahead of Jake . " Has he gotten off ? " he asked , without looking back . " Mas'r , what do I know about it ? " " For God 's sake , you know more than you can keep in your head ! Is he gone and safe ? " Jake Thompson , bowed by his grain sack , spoke in a muffled voice . " Hear-tell Josh and Lil Jones lit like two birds . Sadday 's mighty good day cause bosses cai n't get no posters out before Monday . " " Will you know it if they get caught ? " " Yassir . " " What will you do then ? " Jake did not answer for a moment , then he said in his bowed voice , " Cover up them tracks ' n ' start ag'in . " Simon watched his own feet moving along the sidewalk ; he watched them with fascination . If he were a black man , they would be his only hope and salvation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and straightened himself . Simon waited , but he did not look around as Jake began speaking again . " I seen fellers go and come back , an ' be afraid to go , and maybe not go at all , and I seen queerer things than that . I seen mamas smother their little babies and pretend they died natural and I seen one bound woman after she cut her own throat . Seems a mighty shame . They cudda all lit . Folks do n't know the trouble they is . Things is kept nice on the surface . " He spoke in his bright , light voice and swung his sack onto his shoulder again with a merry grunt . " But I reckon there ai n't nobody in the world kin see in the dark like us . . . not even the white folks that he'p us . " Simon came to his gate and went up the path and into the kitchen door . He stood meditatively , his hat still on , by the kitchen table . He heard Jake pass a joke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor and heard Jake 's good-by . He turned around and looked at him . " Jake , " he said , " why do n't you clear out , go up to Canada , make a life for yourself ? They 'll catch up with you one clay , and then you 'll have as much chance as a hog at killing t i me . " Jake munched the apple Prudence had given him . " I 'm slicker than a hog , mas'r . " " You 've got freedom in your blood ! " Jake grinned and stuck the apple in his pocket . " There 's twothreekinds of colored folks : them that ca n't stand no more , them that sticks by their folks , and them that figgers to lie low . And then , some knows and some do n't know . " " What ? " Jake laughed . " About the way we kin make a war in heaven . They 's Parson 's Abe over in Cayuga County . Parson 's Abe done raise up twenty black fellers las ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Abe was near as good as Nat Turner . Nat Turner jest about took over the whole state of Virginny when I was a hop-along kid .

Now they know about Parson 's Abe  --  if they Essen to the folks dat travel at night . " " Prayer meetings ? " asked Simon with a tight smile . " Rinda . Some got good singin ' . Most 's mighty quiet though . Black folks are powerful whisperers . " Jake put on his hat and took it off , and finally settled for it on his head . " I 'd hate to git out , mas'r . Dey 's such a lot doin ' . I 'd hate to miss anything . " Simon laughed shortly and put out his hand . " Boss Jake , I 'll take my orders from you from now on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Next time mebbe It 'll be more den a pair of pants we need . Mebbe we 'll put you on an underground train . Sometimes you do n't know when you 're rid in ' one of dem trains till you 're a long way on de road . " Jeb Larkin was dead and Jake Thompson was alive , but they field the two ends of the thread between them . Simon sat in the eat-laden dark , his chair tipped against a tree . Never had timep246moved so fast . He had been searching out a matter ever since that night in Cartecay when Jeb had talked with him at the houseraising  --  nighabout a year ago . He closed his eyes in the darkness and leaned his head against the tree . This sweet night held no answer . Milledgeville revealed no answer . The mountains were silent . Jeb and Jake were bigger than the mountains or Milledgeville . Jeb was dead because the fight had worn him out ; Jake was alive because the same fight had given him life . But where could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to think in terms of individuals , but to give a fellow a pair of escape-pants he must know how those pants fitted into the bigger picture , how that escaping fellow completed a pattern . Maybe he was a fool but he had to think in big terms . Once he had had to think in bigger terms than the mountains ; now he had to think in bigger terms than the legislature of Georgia . He fanned himself with his handkerchief . This freedom business , as Savanna called it , was bigger than the whole South . He reckoned it must somehow take in the whole earth .. . He came into the red parlor and stood looking at Savanna who was writing on a slate for her black pupils . He watched her for some time , leaning against the door , his hands in his pockets . He spoke suddenly , " I 'm goin ' North . I 'm goin ' up to Washington . I 'm goin ' to find out how this country 's run . I 'm goin ' to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She surveyed him with her great , black eyes . " All right . I 'm ready . " A grin broke at the corner of his mouth . " I thought you were fixed again so you 'd stay home . " She moved her chalk over the slate , and said mockingly , " My babies will be had between times , when I 'm not busy . " Savanna rctrimmed her bonnet and sewed , with Prudence , three sprigged muslin dresses . Simon read again the January issue of the New York Tribune and copied in his notebook the address of the National Era in Washington . He went one afternoon to buy tickets on the stage to Atlanta , and meeting Hare outside the Keystone Hotel , went into the bar with him . " I 'm going up to Washington to look things over , Rufe . Theway we 've got to fight is shapin ' up . It wo n't be long now . " Hare 's chin sank against his thick chest ; his eyes were sad . " Thep247North beats up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Rufe , folks are fightin ' slavery somewhere . I 'm dead sure of that . " " Fight here , " Hare 's huge hands lay like fists on the hotel table . " You 'll be a marked man if you get Northern connections . " Simon laughed and stretched his legs above the dirty unpainted floor . " A marked man ? I 'm not a marked man yet ? " Hare did not answer . The heat pasted his rough hair against his forehead . He put up two fingers to loosen his neck-band , and Simon saw that his fingers trembled . Simon felt a dull weight fill his heart . " Why not the North , Rufe ? " " I want to see Southern folks settle Southerner problems . " The sweat formed on his forehead and he put up his hand to wipe it away , and his hand remained against his brow , half concealing his eyes . Simon scuffed slowly at the floor with his heel , his hands pressed yet deeper into his pockets . " Southern folks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I would n't change being a Southerner for anything in the world . " He looked slowly at Hare . " But do you think the decentest men in the world are going to talk away a four billion dollar invest-ment ? " flare brought his hand clown with a crash on the table , but no words followed the gesture . Simon turned swiftly and laid his hand on Hare 's . " Rufe , you 're a fighter ! " " By God , I am ! " He did not look at Hare , but slipped his hand back into his pocket . " I heard you say once that when poor black men get pushed down , poor white men get the same treatment quicker than a spit in the eye . I reckon I want to see men lick men 's problems no matter where . " He never forgot the way Hare said , " Bliss . . . Listen , Bliss . Southern men have got Southern problems . Stick to that . " The lonely fight leaves its stamp on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the night before they were to leave , " Jake Thompsoncum t ' see ye . Seemed mighty cut-up you wuz n't here . Say he 'll come to the stage tomorrer an ' say good-by . " " That 's fine . " Prudence took up Simon 's boots and a polishing rag . " You 'll be comin ' back , Mr.-Miz Bliss , ai n't that so ? " " If we get re-elected , Prudence . " Prudence said harshly , " You cum back like you ought . ' Tai n't God 's will you stay away . " Outside the dry-goods store of Twiggs , the New Englander , they waited for the stage the next morning . That was mountain luggage surrounding them , sure enough , the trunk cut from Gilmer pine and bound with hickory loops , the bags woven of mountain straw and bound with rawhide . " What do you reckon they 'll see before they get back to the mountains ? " Savanna said with a little laugh as if Simon could read her thoughts . " Lordy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She stepped back from the road as the dust from the stage rose in her face , and she felt a large gentle hand against her waist . " Mr. Alston ! " she said , catching her breath . The sunlight filled Michael 's tawny hair . The smile on his face was the smile of a well-wisher . " Going away , ma'am ? " he said . " Ah  --  I recollect . Mama told me . To Washington ? " " That 's right , Mr. Alston . " The stage driver called , " Time to get goin ' ! No dallyin ' ! " Simon looked around swiftly . Jake Thompson had not come to say good-by . He had five dollars for Jake Thompson , but he put it back in his pocket . Simon helped a widow-lady into the stage , her long , black dress hemmed with dust , her heavy mourning veil shutting out the air , and turned to find Michael 's large white hand held out to him and then to Savanna . Alston 's voice was warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " for awhile . I 'll be waiting for you when you conic back . " " That 's something two can do as easy as one . Eh , Alston ? " Simon grinned suddenly , paused for a moment , and ducked into the stage . " But now I wonder , " he saicl , settling himself between Savanna and the widow-lady , " if he was talking to me or to you ? " Outside they heard the driver shouting to the horses . The lurch of the stage flung them one against the other . The widow-lady spoke in a soft , breathless voice . " Jake Thompson tole me to say good-by t ' ye . He says t ' tell you that now you 're ridin ' on an underground train . " 248p249SIMON SWUNG HIMSELF SLOWLY OVER TO THE SEAT FACING THE WIDOWlady . " Ma'am , " he said , his voice trembling a little , " what are you saying ? " The soft voice behind the veil was unsteady . " I clone jes ' what Jake Thompson tole m @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He has n't speak to you hisself wid dat genmun talkin ' to you . " " Ma'am , " said Simon tightly , " would you mind lifting your veil ? " The slender body stiffened and then a black gloved hand moved slowly to lift the veil . Two great eyes , frightened and unblinking , looked at him from a dark brown face . " Thankee , " said Simon automatically , " put down that veil . " Savanna laughed softly . " Jake Thompson 's not saying Good-by , Simon . He 's saying Howdy with a vengeance . " Simon stared at the black veil , and he knew now that large eyes were watching him . Suddenly he laughed . " By God , Jake Thompson'ssmarter than a fox ! God Almighty , if that does n't beat everything ! " He turned to the widow-lady . " Did n't he send any message to me besides that good-by ? " The black bonnet shook . " Not a one about what to do with you ? " The black bonnet shook again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The soft voice faltered , " He jes ' said I 'd git No'th thisaway for sure . " Simon rubbed his hand across his eyes . " And no hitches , he means . Not even a little breakdown . " The voice was young , trying to be brave . " I 'll make it sure , mas'r ? " Simon stared at the black veil . " Looks like we 've got to be first ( lass engineers on this line , even if we do n't know a thing aboutp250locomotives . " He sucked in his cheeks . " What 's your name , young woman ? " The veil lifted so that the black eyes could stare at him unhampered . There was a note of surprise in the voice . " My name 's Joe Manson , mas'r . " Additional passengers were waiting at the ten-mile point , where the horses were freshened . Simon got out of the stage and helped the driver change the horses while the new passengers hauled their belongings to the top of the stage , assisted only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hastily into his old seat . " Do n't lift that veil for anything , and do n't talk beyond No and Yes . The fat man 's a planter from Shady Dale , and the feller with the beard 's a South Carolina clergyman . I 'd trust both of them as far as from , here to the sheriff . " Joe did not answer . Only his feet curled and his hands moved nearer together on his lap . " Move over , " Savanna said , " let me sit next to Joe . " The fat man made the stage lurch . He was a cross , fat man who settled himself with a scowl in inadequate space . He stared fiercely and did not answer Simon 's " Howdy , " but shouted instead at the Negro boy who scampered onto the box beside the driver . Savanna took one of the widow 's black gloved hands , and patted it gently , her large eyes fixed on the fat man . The clergyman , who was a powerful man with a grizzly beard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him the proper space . The clergyman , who introduced himself promptly as Mr. Harris , looked at each in turn with small , penetrating , inexorable eyes . " In sorrow ? " he asked abruptly , nodding toward the black figure . Savanna nodded . " Husband ? " Savanna said softly , " Terrible sorrow , " and bent her head . Within so short a space of time she trembled to look into strange eyes . " God 's mercies never fail , " and Mr. Harris leaned forward to pat a black gloved hand . Savanna felt the stiffening of the boy 's body . " She 's sick with sorrow , " Savanna said . " She has n't said a word since her husband 's funeral . " " A good , devoted woman , " the clergyman said , and peered with a sudden naked curiosity.  |p251Savanna  put her arm around the black shoulders and drew the head against her shoulder . Only a veil hung between Joe and exposure . She felt his head resist the pressure of her hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that separated him from her , separated one human being from another . He was unhappy with his head against her shoulder , and when the clergyman turned to scrut size the fat man again , she released the pressure of her hand . She glanced obliquely at Simon . Simon 's insatiable brown eyes never left the fat man or the clergyman . His white-knuckled fist lay on his knees . She lowered her head , patting the gloved hand abstractedly . The dust rose and choked them . The heat hung about them like a hangman 's hood . The fat man and the clergyman , sitting by the windows , caught the only breeze that passed . In the back of the coach , the heat was suffocating . A gloved hand went up beneath the veil and returned to the black lap again covered with moisture . Savanna pressed a handkerchief into the hand . The fat man said suddenly , " Damn fool women . Why do n't she take off that veil ? " Savanna said , " Sir , you 're forgetting yourself ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the gentleman suggests you take off your veil . " The black head shook and a little voice said " No 'm . " Simon spoke suddenly , " Do you reckon Joe Brown 'll get renominated ? " and the fat man answered violently , " If we could git him on some of them bank deals , he would n't git renominated ! " The clergyman said , " We ca n't afford to split the Democratic party . If you do n't take Brown , you 'll take a split . " Simon said , " This is the way I think . . . " and Savanna closed her eyes . The boy was helpless . Mercy would never reach as far as him . Not a black-face-mercy . She held his hand . He said he was fourteen , running away to reach his pa in Canada . Her closed eyes harried her with visions . A thousand miles to freedom at the rate the old stage was traveling . . . She wondered who the lady was in Milledgeville who had given her widow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's faith could teach so far beyond his sight and hearing . She wondered how long Simon could talk and whether he would be able to talk right when the crisis came . She detested caution . She loathed subterfuge . Anger rose in her . A year ago , her anger would have flayed . Now shep252opened her eyes and looked swiftly at the fat man and the clergymanand lowered her eyes again to her own tightly closed hand . Savanna thanked God for politics . Sounds came to her in strange voices , but no words . Simon had set them off against each other , and the fat man had unfastened his neckerchief in order to argue better . The clergyman 's eyes were never still , moving from the window to the black figure , to the planter , to the black figure . The heavily rutted road flung them against each other , and once Mr. Harris lurched forward and saved himself only by clutching the knee of the widow-lady . Savanna hushed the little scream that came from behind the black veil , and Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ca n't tell me that Barnwell Rhett in South Caroliny is n't . . . " and Savanna wiped the perspiration from her brow and felt the springs of fear coil and uncoil within her . When they stopped again for fresh horses , the fat man and Mr. Harris left the stage to continue their argument with Simon in a walking position , and Savanna whispered , " Get down , Joe . Walk on the other side of the coach . Lean on me if anyone comes . " They paced along the road slowly , Savanna telling him when he might lift his black veil in safety . " God Almighty , ma'am . This thing do n't let me breathe . " " Keep walking , Joe , " she said , " slowly . Hold it up until I warn you . " A horseman came down the road toward them . Joe needed no warning . She heard a faint groan as the veil dropped . When the horseman had passed she said , " Again . They 're buckling up the last horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage , she supported him with an arm about his waist . He whispered , " I 'd ruther take a chance without this gear , ma'am . I 'd ruther lick across a field in my pants . " " Jake Thompson gave you orders . You 'll mind them . " The clergyman supported the widow-lady under her elbow as she mounted the coach and sank with an outpuffing of breath into the hot trap of her corner . Savanna took up the black gloved hand again and outstared the clergyman . Simon said , " Now if I were a legislator . . . " and Savanna tried to master the sleepiness which laid a spell upon her with the heat and the dust . At noon they stopped for dinner . Simon assisted the widow-lady to the public house , and asked the landlord for a private room . " You 'll fix on the ladies ' parlor , " the landlord said curtly . " Hey ,  |p253you  , git them traps out of the way ! Damn lazy niggers ! Hey  --  you , Bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mean cuss . You tell , that widderladyto lock the door of the ladies ' parlor . " Simon looked at him quickly . His young , round face was blank . Simon watched him to t lie bar where he ordered a drink , and Simon felt a cold sweat bathe his body . In the ladies ' parlor , he said to Joe , " You stay behind that door , and , Savanna , you throw the bolt when I leave the room . " Then he went hastily to the bar and stationed himself where he could see all those who carne near the room . The clergyman drew out a chair and sat down beside him . " Now , as far as they 're bein ' two Souths , I do n't hold with you . There 's the white South and  --  the white South . You ca n't rightly make two things out of one . " In the ladies ' parlor , Joe stood in the middle of the room while Savanna slipped the bolt softly . He was a taut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction . " Stay away from the window too , " Savanna said , " and take off your bonnet . " She smiled at him . " You 're a smart boy , Joe . You 'll stake it . " But as she took off her own bonnet and shook the dust out of her hair and her full skirts , the tautness inside her curled tighter than a well-made spring . Fear was the biggest thing in her life now . Her stomach , her chest , her jaws ached with the rigidity of fear . Her fingers trembled when she tried to steady them . Everyone'syour enemy now , she saic , to herself , just remember that . She motioned Joe against the wall when a knock came , and opened the door only wide enough to receive the dinner tray . To the Negro servant she whispered , " The lady 's lying down . Be real quiet . " She saw Joe 's eyes and said , " When did you eat last ? " " Yesterday . " " Then you 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The cabbage had boiled to death and the pork was cold and fat , but Joe , being a growing boy , made no complaints . She watched him shovel the food as she moved her fork among the watery cabbageleaves . " Did you think of running away all by yourself ? " " Yes 'm . " " Were n't you afraid ? "  | " Yes 'm . " " What are you going to do when you reach your Pa ? " " Git me a job makin ' machines . " She fiddled with her fork and wiped her hot brow . " Do many people do work like that ? " " Reckon not , ma'am . " " What would you have done if Jake had n't gotten you this dress ? " His fork was poised , half way to his mouth . " Cum on the way I cum from Gordon , I reckon , ma'am . " " From Gordon ? " " I kept off the road  --  Pa taught me that . Cum at night . Kept away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the long oval head with the close-cropped hair rising from the high black neck of the dress and asked , " Are you scared now , Joe ? " He hesitated for only a moment . " Yes 'm . " She held a damp handkerchief against her mouth . " My husband 's got a pistol in his bag . " Joe wailed suddenly , " Oh , Lord Jesus , ma'am , I do n't want to put nobody to no trouble . I just want t ' git to my Pal " Later in the day , the fat man left them . He was still angry . " You ca n't put South Caroliny ideas over that-a-way , " he was saying , turning a red face toward the clergyman as he let himself out of the stage backward . " It ai n't goin ' be Georgians who listen to damn fools and pull out of this blessed Union . " He did not wait for an answer , but shouted to his Negro boy and helped him down with the luggage by hooking his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled tightly and stretched his legs . He took off his black hat and wiped his forehead . Then he unfolded a newspaper and scanned the lead column . Without lifting his eyes , he said to the widow-lady , " Ma'am , as a servant of God , I advise you to take off that veil and enjoy the evening breezes . " After a moment , the little voice said softly , " No , sir . " He looked at Simon and shook his paper slightly . " Funny things happen . " Simon answered , " You can hear of a heap if you keep your ears peeled . " " Fact is , you ca n't always tell what folks are . That 's one of thep255funniest things ever . Here 's something about a family over to Batesburg , South Carolina . Know ' em real well . That 's my church . They 're just as pleasant as you please . But seems , according to this , that folks heard things about them , and they got a coat of tar . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh  --  things . Do n't say here . Things that did n't set well with cotton-plantin ' folks , I reckon . " " Would seem as though they had the right to say what they please without a coat of tar , " Simon said mildly . " Yes and no , " said the clergyman . " From my experience I 'd say it was generally  --  no . " Night came . Savanna listened to the deep breathing of the boy , and knew that he had fallen asleep . In the darkness she tried to stretch the muscles of her thighs and arms . The eternal lurching of t ! ie stage churned her mind and bruised her body . The unidentifiedpassenger , who had taken the fat man 's place late in the ; afternoon , shouted out the window , " When do we get out of this hell wagon ? " The driver gave no answer . " I want my dinner ! " The driver cracked his whip , and the horses lunged forward and pulled frantically for a hundred yards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later , the stage stopped . The driver 's dusty face was thrust through the opened door . " All passengers out . Gentlemen got to push this yere stage up the hill. , Dinner 's at the top . " The horses were breathing hard , and steaming . The driver took the bridles and the three gentlemen applied themselves to the rear of the stage . Savanna drew Joe to the side of the road , and , through the tough grass , started up the hill . " That 'll do fine ! " the driver shouted , three-fourths of the way to the top . " Reckon they kin make it now . " The clergyman and the stranger did not give up , but Simon hurried to walk beside the slowly moving women . He said hastily , " I 'm afeared of this clergyman , and I 'm afeared of this widow 's get-up . Mind carefully . Do n't let him talk to you . " Then he added softly , " When we get to Atlanta , Joe 's goin ' to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 1 At the top of the hill , the driver was shouting at the horses and persuading them through the broken paling of a fence . The openp256door of the inn showed the light of a cooking fire but few other lights . The clergyman panting , the sweat running into his beard , stood in the doorway waiting for them . Simon 's hand stole out and grasped Joe 's arm . " When you get inside , " he whispered , " sink down and pretend to cry . " Mr. Harris said , " That last tenth of a mile winds you up for a good dinner . " " Got no call to hope for much dinner , " Simon said , and then as Mr. Harris stretched out his hand to help the widow-lady over the sill , he said , " Coin ' far ? " Mr. Harris looked at him and showed his dark teeth in a smile . " Goin ' as far as you , I reckon . Atlanta ? " " Atlanta 's right . " The widow-lady sank into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her hands . " Ah , law , " Savanna cried , kneeling beside the chair . " We must get her to a room . " The public room was heavy with smoke and loud with voices . Drovers stood at the bar , and the fire crackled with the accuracy of their tobacco juice . Simon pounded on the table and , when they looked at him , demanded the landlord . " That 's me , " a tall , sad man in open shirt and short breeches said , but he did not leave his place by the bar . " A private room for this lady , if you please . " " Right away ? " " Right away . " The landlord sent a stream of tobacco juice into the fire , turned back to the drovers , and the voices rose again . Simon turned to find Mr. Harris ' eyes on him . " You got to holler real loud , " Mr. Harris said . " ' Tai n't no good askin ' once . Hey , you boy ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a room ready for this lady ! " He turned with his dark smile to Simon . " Better sit down . It 'll take a couple more hollers . " Simon did not sit clown . He smiled , and leaned against the back of the widow-lady 's chair , watching for the first move of the landlord . Savanna slipped her hand through his arm , and he pressed it against his side . The stage driver came in , and the other passenger . The driver followed a routine evidently prescribed by himself . He went straight to the bar , gave his order , slapped the landlord on the back , looked over the drovers for a friend , and then returned to the door top257inspect the notices tacked to a board . He read them carefully , sales notices and mortgage notices , and then he shouted back to the bar , " Hey , Bert , ye got this yere nigger boy tied up good ? " and tapped with his finger at a notice side by side to a mortgage sale . " Ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called back , " give him time . " " Got the trap baited good ? " Bill roared with laughter and went to claim his drink . " I ai n't found any good nigger bait , less it 's a full-sized meal . " Savanna felt the tenseness that came into Simon 's arm , and t tuned her head slowly with his . Mr. Harris strolled to the notice and bent to read it , his arms crossed behind his back . He turned his head slightly and looked at them . " Like to hear it ? " " Does n't make much difference , " Simon said . " Reckon as a law-abiding citizen you ought to hear it . " He read slowly with emphasis . " $too reward . Ran away from subscriber on Saturday night last , 7th inst. , Negro boy , Joe , about fourteen years old . " ( Joe moved suddenly . Simon put his hand on his shoulder . ) " He is medium sized , dark complexioned , looks younger than his age . Does not answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shirt , no shoes . I will give the above reward if taken in good condition . Alexander H. Manson . Gordon , June 19 , 1859 . " Mr. I larris turned around . " I guess that 's duty plain as can be . Though I do n't hold with rewards . They interfere with duty . " Simon said , " I reckon you do n't come across those boys often . They 're slippery propositions . " Mr. Harris turned away and went toward the bar . " Niggers have n't any brains . They never git far . " He laid his coin down and stood silently and a little apart , his back to the bar . Simon was afraid of silence ; he roared again . " Landlord , what 's the matter with two rooms and a little service ? " The landlord did not stir from among the drovers . He called out to a Negro servant , " Rooms 2 and 3 , Abe , " and turned his back on his guests . But Simon knew , as they went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes were following them . Ile examined the door of Number 2 , and moved the table to block the entrance . " The table against the door 'll waken you if anyone comes in . Then holler . Do n't be scared , youngster . You 'll make it . "  | " Sure . I 'll make it now , " he said , but his smile was fleeting . " Take off your bonnet , Joe , " Savanna said quietly , " and turn around . I 'll undo your dress . " Her fingers were trembling . She would take vengeance some day on the people who made dark fear rise up in her . When the fastenings were undone , she put her arm for a moment across the boy 's shoulder . " Do n't think about that poster , " Simon was saying . " It does n't mean a thing . " He leaned against the edge of the table as Joe folded the dress and sat on the edge of the bed in his shirt and pants . " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little . " You 're all right , youngster . You 're a fine boy . " Joe grinned and looked down at his hands . " But , say  --  fourteen ? That 's a man ! " Joe grinned and shot him a quick upward look . " When you get those bones filled out , you 're goin ' to be a big feller . Have you thought what Canada 's goin ' mean to you ? " The grin was fixed now . " Yessir ! Reckon it 's near the best place in the world . Bet they 's a heap of work but no boss-drivers . Bet I kin fiddle with them machine-ideas and nobody 'll call me lazy nigger . ' Bet they 's a pile of chittlin 's and fatback and pone . " His grin wavered for only a moment , and his eyes went to Simon . " Ai n't they , mas'r ? " " That 's what I hear-tell . Can do what you like and get paid for it , and plenty of chittlin 's thrown in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Lordy , Lordy .. . He put his elbows on his knees and propped his chin against his hand . " I done make a real handy li'le cotton picker . Were n't as good as I cuda made , but it did n't take no time . Boss-driver done break it up . Said only a lazy nigger 'd a-thought of something like that . " He sighed and dropped his hands between his knees . " I heartellthey do n't use cotton-pickers in Canada . " Savanna 's hand rested on his shoulder again . Simon smiled . " You can think of something else . Seems like the North 's gettin ' hold of heaps of machine ideas . Maybe you 'll figger out something and be a big man , and we can say , Doggone it , we knew him when he was just thinking that up . " Joe grinned and shifted his feet . " Mas'r , I got heaps of ideas ! I got an idea for weavin ' things , and I got an idea for plowin ' , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  |p259Simon  whistled . " I just want to know if you 'll remember me when you 're famous . " " Yes , sir . I 'll remember you . " The soft black eyes swept to Savanna . " I reckon I 'll remember you both fer ever an ' ever . " Simon stood up slowly , the candlelight flinging his huge shadow on the wall . " Do n't you think of anything now but getting to the North and getting through to Canada . And you hold on to that black dress . Pants are out , after all . That reward poster did n't say a word about a black dress . " Joe hunched his shoulders . " It said a heap o ' other things . " " But nothing about a black dress . Put that table against the door , and do n't sleep too heavy . " Joe looked at him slowly , obliquely . " Are they goin ' cum , mas'r ? " " You know what I know , Joe . They 're always hangin ' around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But do n't be scared , youngster . If they come we 'll give them hell . " Simon looked back from the door . Joe still sat on the edge of the bed , the shadows heavy behind him , his large eyes following them , his drooping hands stiff . Fourteen was too old for him . He was a child . " Easy , Joe , " Simon said softly , his hand on the door . Joe blinked once and ran the back of his hand across his mouth . He smiled faintly . Outside the locusts sawed suddenly , high and rasping , in the hot night . It seemed to Simon that he had not slept at all . Yet Savanna 's voice came from far away . " Simon  --  Simon ! That 's Joe ! " He pulled on his trousers and did not wait for his shirt . The narrow hall was lighted by the sharp beam of flaring candles held by the landlord and the stage driver who were running from the floor below . Simon heard the cry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's room , blocking the entrance . He saw Joe 's thin young body crouching by the window , a stool raised above his head , while , with a pistol in his hand , the clergymanlunged forward in an effort to seize the stool . " Joe ! " Simon cried . The soft eyes wavered for only a moment . " Joe  --  jump !  --  Joe stood up slowly , closed his eyes tightly , and flung the stool so accurately that Mr. Harris screamed . Then he leaped to the window , his eyes turned toward Simon , his mouth open but nop260sound coming , his child 's face wet with fright . He jumped , and Simon did not wait for the thud of landing . He flung himself toward the stairs and the landlord let go of his candle and it fell to the splintering steps . At the top of the stairs , the clergyman was shouting , " Catch that man ! Do n't let him get out ! " and Savanna was crying , " Simon  --  take care . That black boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stage driver flung himself past the Negro servant and pinioned Simon to the floor . Simon was stronger than the stage driver and got to his knees , but the clergyman and the landlord reached him before he could regain his feet . Savanna , running down the stairs and past them to the door , was seized by the clergyman and flung into a chair . " I 'll get that boy , not you ! Not you ! " He ran out into the darkness , toward the pools of light which came from the open windows . But Savanna did not linger in the chair . She too ran into the dark , making a trumpet of her hands and crying , " Run , Joe . Run as hard as you can ! " The clergyman struck at her in a rage , but she shouted again , " Joe , Joe  --  run ! " The clergyman seized her arms and forced her before him into the inn . She thought with violent impotence of her white womanhood . It gave her nothing in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Never in her life had she been so angry . She had never been defeated  --  never once defeated . She looked at Simon as the clergyman thrust her again into a chair . The landlord stood on one side of him with a stick of firewood , while the stage driver stood on the other side with a long-barreled pistol . Simon said , " You wo n't catch that boy . You wo n't catch that boy . He 's got freedom in his very guts . " The perpetual never-dying fire of a Southern hearth lighted his half-naked body and showed the hard muscles of his arms and shoulders . He sat with his legs doubled back , his hands gripping the sides of the chair . The clergyman turned on him in a cold rage , " Shut up your mouth , you brigand . " His face was white and wet with sweat . He said to the landlord , " It 's black as a sinner out there . Any dogs handy ? " " Ai n't no dogs in this section nohow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captain live ? " The landlord lowered his firewood . " Watch him ! " the clergyman warned . " Watch him every moment . Where does the patrol captain live ? "  | " Two-three miles . " " Tell your nigger to fetch him up . " " Not my nigger . He 'll go two-three miles in t' other direction . " " Send someone . " The landlord hesitated . " Ai n't no one knows the way . " The clergyman jerked his thumb toward Simon . " Tie him up , and go yourself . " " Tie me up , " said Simon quietly , " and I 'll break your arms . " The clergyman looked at him with narrow eyes . Presently he walked to the fireplace to light his pipe , and when he rose he held a piece of firewood . Simon put up his arms , half rising , but the blow caught him across the crown of his head . Savanna did not scream ; her hands tightened on her chair and her head grew dizzy . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stage driver slid his pistol into his pocket and went to unwind a rope from a trunk . Simon drew in his breath with a hissing sound , and the muscles in his arms swelled and grew weak . When the driver returlied , the clergyman tied his hands to the chair and then laughed for the first time , a sharp , unsteady sound . " ' Tai n't nice to use means like this nor hit a lady . . . But I got a fondness for the law and this pair has n't . You git a horse , " he said to the landlord . " You 've got a duty to the law as well as me . You git that patter-roller over here as fast as you kin ride . And lay out a pan of water so the lady kin clean up her husband 's head . " The faint , far-off excitement of a dull man had lighted in the landlord 's eyes when he first picked up the piece of firewood , and it kindled now more brightly . He lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after awhile he could be heard calling his Negro servant and eventually riding away . Savanna bathed Simon 's head , and made a bandage of the coarse cloth . Midnight was a time of silence . No night birds cried ; owls were still . The clergyman sat with his chin against his hand , betweenSavanna and the door . " I figured there was something wrong early in the afternoon , " he said to no one in particular . " Seemed like a white lady would show white even behind that big veil . And when I helped her out of the coach , it seemed like it was n't white skin between her glove and her sleeve . Seemed like . I could n't be sure . " The driver , whose pistol lay idle in his lap , said without greatp262interest , " And you bust right into the room . How come if it had been a lady ? " The clergyman was sharp . " It were n't . You saw that . " " I saw nothing . Only saw this feller lamming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Come up and I 'll show you .. .. " Then he narrowed his eyes . " I was only joking . Stay where you are . But up in that room is that widow-lady 's black dress , and it was a nigger boy jumped out the window . " The driver was sleepy . " Maybe the widow-lady 's hidin ' under the bed . " The clergyman turned on him angrily . " You mind your tongue and take care ! " Savanna listened into the darkness . Might she hear Joe ? If he were stirring in the underbrush a mile away , might she hear him ? She listened . She looked at Simon , his head against the pillow she had arranged behind him , and anger sent the blood pounding into her heart again . Simon 's brows were drawn together , and his lips trembled . Once his eyes opened and he looked at her . She went to him and kissed him and told him to sleep . The driver said , " That 's right . It 'll take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to listening , and the clergyman smoked , his eyes as bright as steel . The driver produced some cards from his pocket and squatted on the floor . " Ca n't see why I got to go without my sleep . Reckon this ai n't any business of mine . " " For obstructin ' the law , " the clergyman said , " there 's a mighty big fine . Mind you do n't obstruct the law by goin ' to sleep . " Two hours later the patrol captain came back with the landlord . He was a thickset man with angry eyes in which sleep sat jaggedly . " Damn nigger , " he said . " You wo n't find him till daylight . Like for me to stand outside and whistle with my fingers ? " The clergyman said nothing . He pointed to the reward poster nailed near the door . The patroller scowled , drawing his thick brows together , and patting down his sleep-rumpled hair . " Caught a nigger once before , " he said . " With this hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land . I 'll ride down the road a mite , though they do n't ever keep to the roads . " He read the description of the fugitive again , his lips moving with the words . " Ought to pick up somebody . "  | " Pick up the right one , " the clergyman said stiffly . The patroller stared at him and laughed suddenly . " Sure . Why not ? " He went out , leaving the door open , and now the clergyman allowed it to remain open . They heard the patroller 's horse stirring and then going off at a trot . In the darkness , Joe would be able to hear that trotting horse . . , if Joe were not already beyond the sound . Savanna did not remember when the dawn came . She must have slept , her head upright against her chair . She wakened suddenly to see the faint early light coming through the open door , and she looked across the gray , flat country with the misdirected alertness of the newly wakened . Joe was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Joe . She turned swiftly to Simon . He had not shifted his position . His lips were twitching , his brow was still knotted . The clergyman sat by the door , his position unchanged , a dead pipe between his teeth , his eyes steely bright on her . The driver lay on the floor , his cheek against his cards . The landlord was not here . Savanna could hear the rattle of the well bucket and the cry of a cock . She sat with the rigidity of wakefulness , feeling a grim yawningfear , wishing that the sun would rise swiftly so as to flood the world with light . She was frightened , with the nameless fear that comes with dawn , when the resistance is low and the immobility of night must be exchanged for some positive and perhaps violent action . She sat with an aching tenseness , fastening her mind on the dishes that were clattering in the kitchen . Outside , the anonymity of dawn was giving place , and clown the road she heard a horseman riding . Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Down the toad the horse stopped . She heard a voice cry out . The clergyman turned in his chair and tried to see through the door . Simon opened his eyes . Savanna sat more rigid , her hands clasped tightly in her lap . The cry was repeated , a gun was fired . The clergyman left his chair and stood in the doorway . Suddenly he shouted and plunged toward the road . The driver wakened and sat up . Savanna looked across at Simon . " Joe ? " asked Simon . Savanna did not answer ; she slid not move . Simon moved his head against the pillow and pushed himself more erect . " Listen to me , " he said harshly . " When the stage leaves , you go  |p264to  Atlanta . They wo n't dare to keep you . Come to the depot every morning until you hear from me . " He tried to raise a hand to his head , forgetting the rope . The driver staggered across to him on his newly wakened legs . " Ca n't stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head , " he said , untying the rope . " Get a stretch till them buzzards come back . " Simon rose unsteadily to his feet , his hand on Savanna 's shoulder , and stared at him . " Are you sure you know what you 're saying ? " The driver shuddered with sleepiness and stumbled to the door in search of a pail of water and a towel . " I 'm from Pennsylvany , " he said , leaning against the door and turning his head . " I ai n't got time to chase nigger boys all over Georgy . " He shook his head and shuddered again . " And I ai n't got time to hold my eyelids open with a horse pistol all night long , either . " " Come back here ! " Simon said . The driver stumbled back , massaging his scalp . " Will you wait ten minutes outside Newborn for me this morning ? Just ten minutes ? " Savanna cried , " Simon , you dare n't ! " He paid no attention to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road , and shouting voices were drawing nearer . " Ten minutes ? " Simon stood upright now without holding the chair . The driver grinned . " If you paid your fare , you 're entitled to a seat . " Simon looked at him for a moment , his dark brows still drawn together , then he smiled . Life came into his face again , strength flooding the half-naked body . " Why do n't you make a run for it now , " the driver said , taking a look through the door . " They 've got the nigger boy . " Simon 's face drained of color . " Damn them to fire and hell ! " He lowered himself into the chair . " Tie my hands loose . They 'll hold my wife if I lick oil now . " " Simon , Joe believed . . . " Joe believed something , and so do I. Tie up my hands . We 're the folks that always have the fighting to do . " " You ca n't fight now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road . " They 'll make mincemeat of you . "  |p265Simon  repeated stubbornly , " We 're the ones who 've got to fight forever and ever , amen . " He leaned his head against the pillow and closed his eyes . Savannastood immovable , looking at nothing ( though her head was raised and her eyes were open ) , but listening , listening with a terriblefixity to the shouts outside the door and the slowing horse hoofs . Inside her screamed a faint , far voice that was heard no farther away than her own spirit . When she saw the patroller and the clergyman in the doorway , she turned away . But Simon 's eyes opened , and the nails of one hand bit into the other . The clergyman stood in the doorway , a tight smile on his lips . He looked only briefly at Simon and Savanna , but the tentacles of his regard reached out to curl about them . The patrol captain flung Joe forward with an automatic display of savagery . Joe stumbled against Savanna with a faint whimper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ma'am . He 's a fierce customer . " Savanna 's arm steadied him . She demanded urgently , " Why did n't you run , Joe ? I hollered like blazes . " The boy 's body shook as if freezing . His fumbling hand reached for her skirt like a child , although the gesture was a blind one , unknown to himself . His eyes were closed and small beads of sweat covered his face and his lips , which were twitching with the spasms of his body . The clergyman shoved a chair under Joe . " He was tryin ' to oblige you , ma'am , but he twisted his ankle jumpin ' from that window . God 's on the side of the law . " Savanna felt an anger too great to bear the sight of man or beast . After a moment , when she could make her limbs obey her , she tore strips of the coarse cloth given her for Simon , and soaked them in the pan of water . " What are you doing ? " the clergyman asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bind up his ankle . " The patrol captain laughed . " Who says he 's got a sprained ankle ? Eli ? His High and Mighty Niggerness ? " He drew back his boot and kicked at the swollen ankle . Joe screamed and fell to the floor , clutching his ankle , his head bowed to his knees . " There now  --  there , captain ! " the clergyman exclaimed , his face emptied of color , his hands wavering toward the mighty man .  | " You 're a devil ! " Savanna cried , seizing the poker and flinging herself forward . The clergyman caught her upraised arm and wrenched the poker free . " Fix his ankle , " he said soothingly . " Fix his ankle . Captain Letts do n't mean a thing . " She was sobbing , the tears running down her face . She took a soaked rag and held it against Joe 's ankle , soothing him in a low voice . " Do n't talk to him , " the clergyman said sharply , " unless you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said loudly , " try again . Do n't give up . Try again . Try till you make it . " " You shut up ! " the captain cried , shaking her arm savagely . She tore her arm free and gave no answer . Joe 's head was bowed to his knee . She could see his lips moving , but she knew he was not speaking to her . She forced his leg straight , and motioned to the driver to kneel beside her . The driver knelt , holding the end of the bandage tight against Joe 's ankle , his eyes on the bowed , black head . " Here 's a nip , boy , " he said , his free hand fumbling in his pocket . " Raise up your head . " His thumb and middle finger pulled out the cork and held the bottle to Joe 's lips . " Take a good swig , " he said , and then he wiped Joe 's mouth with his own dirty handkerchief . The captain was angry . " One thing rubs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get up you  --  boy . " He went to the reward-poster and copied the name and address . " An ' do n't dilly-dally , " he added , without turning around . " Git him something to eat , " the driver said , hoisting up Joe under his arms . " Git him some coffee , " he said , finding the landlord with his eyes . The captain turned savagely . " I 'm tellin ' what 's bein ' clone . " Joe stood swaying slightly , his head lowered , his eyes closed . He had had youth and individuality . Now they were blotted out . He would not fight because he was too young , because he was still too close to childish fears . Savanna took him by the arms . She said to him urgently , " Rememberyour Pa . " But Joe had no remembrance . He had only a limp , young body and emptied eyes . His swaying did not ceasep267nor did his eyes open while the captain tied a rope around his waist . The clergyman turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this man a shirt , " he said , jerking his thumb at Simon . " Why ? " Savanna demanded . " Because he 's goin ' and you 're goin ' too . And if you 're convicted you can spend ten years thinking about the law . " Simon spoke for the first time , his head lying back against the pillow . " You ca n't take my wife because she 's accessory to the will of her husband , and merely obeys him in all things . And you ca n't take me without swearing out a warrant . " His eyes were preternaturally bright . " But just the same I 'd like my shirt . " " Your wife is in this over her ears . " " Doing my will , " Simon said quietly . " I 'm responsible for her actions . " Savanna had a violent impulse to laugh , a common , harsh laugh into the face of these men . The clergyman said angrily , " You 've got no right to say what 's to be done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's eyes closed . " Reckon I ought to know what a judge will throw out . " " Let her be , " the stage driver said . " Ai n't you got your hands full ? " " Women do n't figger much in this law , " the captain said . " Leastwayswhite ladies . " " She came at us with a poker , " the clergyman answered angrily . Simon replied wearily . " I told her . Did n't you hear me tell her ? I said , Lam ' em with a poker . ' The driver laughed aloud . Savanna took the shirt from the landlord , who unbound Simon . She hoped , after the shirt had been buttoned , that no one noticed the failure to rebind his hands . The captain said impatiently , " I ai n't got a mind to lug along a woman . And I ai n't fixin ' to argue here any longer . " The clergyman was in a rage . He jerked his thumb again at Simon . " Poke his shirt in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away the landlord 's hands . " After you get a war-rant . " The captain smirked unpleasantly . " A little education certainly makes a feller mean . Come along , reverend mister . He 's got a white man 's rights . " " Then I stay here and watch him . "  | " If you 're the one that wants the warrant , you 'll swear it out . " The clergyman jerked angrily at the rope around Joe 's body . " A man concerned with righteousness certainly gits put out . " He turned furiously . " I want to sec that stage on its way before I leave this fellow . You git my trunk off and git along . " The driver was agreeable . He said , " Certainly , Boss . " Simon looked at Savanna , and she started for the stairs . The clergyman wheeled around . " Where you goin ' ? " " I 'm goin ' on that stage , " she said . " And then I 'm goin ' to Atlantato get help for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the floor . " This has certainly been a lively trip , " he said . " A heap livelier than most . " No one answered him . Simon studied the white bandage around Joe 's ankle without seeing it . His head ached but his thoughts were clear . He would put a ring around this dark day . He laid his head back against the pillow and stared at the pacing figure of the clergyman . Break every chain and let the oppressed go free . The words were spoken quietly . He raised his voice a trifle . " Did you ever preach on that , reverend mister ? " He received no answer . " It does n't matter . Some things are and some things are n't , no matter how they seem , and that 's one of those things you ca n't argue away . " Savanna came down the plank stairs in her bonnet and shawl . She carried Simon 's coat over her arm . She laid it on his lap as she kissed him . " Mind yourself well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And you mind well what I 've said , " he answered , with a half smile . " Every word . " She paused beside Joe and put her arm across his shoulders . Joe gave no sign . The shaking of his body was spasmodic , his eyes were still closed . The driver stared at Simon , a bright , wide stare , and made a farewell gesture with his arm as he went through the door . The others waited , listening . After a moment , they heard the stage door slam . Presently they heard the wheels begin to turn . Before the open door the carriage rolled , blotting out the countryside . Simon lay back silently . The clergyman stood stiff and staring by the door . Only the captain had no patience . " Let 's go ! "  | " Wait till it 's out of sight , " the clergyman said , and then he added in a flat voice , " I do n't trust that woman . " After awhile he said , without turning his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He stared at Simon . Then he said to the landlord , " If he is n't in that particular chair when I get back , I 'll git the law on you too . " Simon closed his eyes and listened to them go out , the heavy tread of the captain , the stumbling of Joe . His heart was tight and hard . " Almighty God , " he prayed . That was all ! Just " Almighty God ! " Through the window , he watched them mount the two horses . As they passed beyond the window , he saw that the end of Joe 's rope was tied to the girth of the captain 's horse and that Joe ran , stumblingon his twisted ankle , behind them . He raised himself to his feet . " God damn you ! " he shouted . " . . . wait till your day comes ! " He sat quietly for fifteen minutes . He watched the landlord bolt the door and wondered if he would have the sense to close the windows . When he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Get me some coffee like a Christian feller . " The landlord said , " Holy God , who 's goin ' pay me for all this ? Everybody clears out and nobody .. . Simon said , " Put your hand in my pocket . That 's payin ' for services you never guessed of . " He waited for only a moment after he was alone . Then he stood up , put his coat on and went softly to the window . The ground was easily accessible and he asked nothing else . He jumped from the window sill and ran , stumbling a little , for his head was bursting , to the stable . He did not wait to saddle the solitary horse . He threw a blanket across its back and mounted with the help of a stool . 1-Ie eased it out of the stable door and trotted it softly to the road . Then he pounded with his heels and slapped its neck . In the pit of his stomach he felt a great emptiness , and fear curled in his heart . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black skin . The pain in his head , his intestines , his spirit , his mind , grew to a pain that shut out all other sensations . If the stage did not wait , he was a marked man . There was no difference between him and Joe . He felt the coloration , the pigmentation of the fugitive . lie swore softly and without repetition . He wished that every white man had to ride this way , sometime  --  once  --  in his life . When he came around the curve in the road , he saw that the stage was waiting , and that Savanna and the driver were standingp270in the road . He tugged on the horse 's mane until it came to a stop , and when he had slid off , he gave a slap to its haunches . " Get goin ' , " he said , " do n't give me away . " Savanna - was not laughing or crying . She held tight to his arm and her face was white . " Get in quick , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Thanks . " " No matter . " The driver scrambled for his seat . " I hate to see fellers pushed around . " The coach lurched , steadied itself on the edge of a rut , and rolled rocking and groaning down the road . Savanna strained his hand in hers , her wide eyes on his face , and was silent until he spoke . His unblinking , unseeing eyes stared at the slow-passing countryside . Suddenly he groaned , the deep dark groan of a man from whom the living light has been shut . She put her arm about him , and his head sank against her shoulder . " What did we do wrong ? " he whispered . " Where did we miss ? " " Reckon we have to learn over and over again , " she answered . " We ca n't , " he groaned , his hand going to his freshly bleedinghead . " Folks in our business 'll never have time . "  |p271HE  STOOD ON B STREET , WASHINGTON CITY , AND LOOKED AGAIN AT THEaddress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the threshold , clucking his head for his tallness was too great for the door . The first room was empty . In the second room , he found a Negro youth writing at a desk . " You 've got an editor here , " he said , consulting his note , " by the name of Daniel Goodloe . I 'd like to see him . " The Negro looked at him with measuring eyes and did not move . Presently he laid down his pen . " Reckon he might like to know who you air . " " Name of Bliss , Simon Bliss . Tell him I got his address from the New York Tribune . " The Negro went from the room with a swift backward look and , when he returned , slid into his chair promptly , still unsmiling . " Says to go in . " Simon went past the desk , pushed open the door , and stood with his hand on the knob in order to take his bearings . Before a great roll-top desk , beside a table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark-haired man with a circle of whiskers under his chin . " Daniel Goodloe ? " Simon said , and the man rose slowly and motioned in silence to a seat . No smiles were exchanged . No warmth generated . Simon sat warily , moving his chair slightly to that Goodloecame out of his shadows . " Reckon it 'll take a mite of talking to tell you who I am . " Goodloe looked at him obliquely . " Hardy says you 're a South-erner . " " The colored boy ? " " Yes . " Simon smiled slightly . " That means I 'll have to mind my tongue well . " He hesitated . " You 're a Southerner yourself , from the sound . " Goodloe turned in his chair slightly . " What can I do for you ? "  |p272Simon  put his head down against his hand and did not answer for a moment . " I do n't know , " he said . " That 's what I do n't know . Wait a minute ! Tell me one thing  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a moment with a sidelong glance . " My record speaks . " Simon made an urgent gesture . " Speak plain , man , in God 's name . If you 're a freedom man . . . " His hands fell . " By the Almighty , what does that mean ? " " What do you want ? " Goodloe said , looking no longer sideways . Simon rubbed his eyes . " I want just one thing . To know how to fight . " Goodloe did not move his eyes ; on the desk his hand doubled . Simon turned so that he looked into the light , and the line between his eyes was deep as a fissure . " I 've got a powerful hatred of slavery , " he said simply . " But that 's not enough . " Goodloe did not answer , nor did he shift his eyes . Simon looked at him . " That 's God 's truth . " Goodloe 's eyes turned away to the papers on the desk . Simon 's voice was urgent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a wonder in his tones , and the line deepened between his eyes . " Where do you come from ? " Goodloe asked briefly . " I come from the Georgia mountains . That means that I come from a place where there 's a power of hatred against cotton lords and slavery . " His eyes did not leave Goodloe 's face . " I was elected to the state legislature on a freedom ticket , but I 've come to the end of knowing . Yet I figured that the fight was bigger than Georgia , and I aimed to make sure . " " Make sure in Washington ? " Goodloe asked from behind his tightly clasped hands . " We set powerful store on the Federal government down where I come from . " Goodloe swayed his chair ever so gently . " Washington 's a Southern city . " " But the country comes together here  --  with free-speaking men . " " In Congress , you mean ? " Goodloe smiled faintly now behind his hands . " What the great planters want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Simon 's eyes were dark with pain . " God sakes , man , you wouldn't272p273be printin ' what the Tribune says you 're printin ' if you did n't think there was a way to humble the planters ! " " You 've never seen a copy of our paper ? " Simon shook his head . Goodloe swiveled his chair and reached for a sheet . As Simon read across the top and down the headlines of the column , he knew that Goodloc had not turned back his chair to the desk , but was staring out of the window . Goodloe was not indifferent . He too was waiting . Simon folded up the paper and handed it back with a half smile . " That 's what I 'd call a fighting sheet . " " We 've been burned out . Washington mobs strike here first . " " Then why do you pretend you got nothing to tell me ? " " Pretend ? " Goodloe 's face was phlegmatic . He said , with fingertipspressed together against his mouth , " I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be important . Back files of a Northern newspaperwill tell you all that I can . " Simon stirred and leaned forward to rest his elbows on his knees . " You 're still scared of me . Why-for ? " For a moment Goodloe did not move so much as his eyes , then he came slowly to his feet and stood against the window . " Mister  --  Bliss ? " " That 's right . " " Mr. Bliss , we 've had men from Georgia come in here pistoled up to their arm-pits . If you run an antislavery paper , you expect that . Now , I have cause to believe in your honesty , because I know how a heap of North Carolinians feel ; I left North Carolina because I felt thataway . But caution 's our first step , and I tell you frankly that I see no call to be incautious . " Anger and pain came into Simon 's eyes . " For God 's sake , I would n't do you harm if I could !

" Goodloe 's chair swayed slightly . " Bare hands have an almighty bower . " " Listen , Mr. Goodloc . There are n't any such easy words to use in Georgia . Some things even mountain folks wo n't stand  --  likeP274the black fellers . But there are folks , men sittin ' in the Assembly , who know a thing or two , who reckon that the poor black man and the poor white man are held down by the same hand , and they want to cut off that hand  --  cut it right down to a stump . There 're even some who hate the black fellers worse'n sin , but know inside themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ em one against the other . Sure there 're only a few of us , but we ca n't fight all alone  --  you ought to see that . " Goodloc turned his face toward Simon . He said softly and calmly , " In Washington , slavery rules everything . " Simon pounded his hands together , and the pain and anger half closed his eyes again . Goodloe turned his chair slowly toward him . " But there are other winds blowing , Mr. Bliss . You can hear ' em by listening . " " I want to be doing , " Simon said sharply . " To be doing . . . " Goodloe was sunk in silence , his chair gently swaying . Not for some minutes did he swing to his desk . " Doing will come , " he said , " soon . " Simon raised his head . Goodloe 's hand touched his fringy beard . " At the ballot box , I think . If not at the ballot box then  --  somewhere else . " Simon said , very softly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , over and over again . " Goodloe hesitated before he answered . " It 'll be war , I think , but we have to try first to make it come peaceful . Peaceful at the ballot box .. " Ballot box ? " Simon grinned . " South , we just have the Democraticparty . " Goodloe looked at Simon with suddenly piercing eyes . " If the slave power can only preserve itself by Northern compromises or a broken Union , which do you think it will do ? The North is mighty strong . The North has the population now . Every shipload pours them in from Europe . They want free land . It 's a struggle for wheat or for cotton . Wheat 's bound to win , for the world is set now to the pace of the North . The North might elect the next President , without any help from the South . Do you think the lords of the land would abide by the people 's choice ? " " The lords are only a few . Maybe we could make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a straight , grim smile . " There 're a few men in Washington worth seeing , " he said . " Isthat what you want ? " " Part of what I want . " P275Goodloe wrote hastily at his desk and slipped a letter into an envelope . " Take this to the House and give it to Thaddeus Stevens . " " Thanks , " said Simon , unsmiling . Goodloe seemed about to answer , but tightened his lips instead . Simon 's hand was in his pocket , over the Stevens ' letter as he went for Savanna . One , two , gathered together ... thousands listening , pondering .. . They went together up the broad steps of the Capitol building ; slowly so that Savanna could tell Grandpa how marble wings spread out on either side and giant statues dazzled the eye and pillars stood ready to be put in place ; so that Simon could lift his gaze to t he unfinished dome and wonder how the sphere would look against the sky and what symbol they would put upon it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crinolines of ladies filled the corridors as if women were the rulers of the land . Savanna looked at them appraisingly , thinking . . . Simon said with a flash of humor , " The men look just like Georgia legislators . By the Almighty , Northerners and Southerners look just the same ! " They went up the steps to the representatives ' offices , and stared unabashedly , without hindrance . Broadcloth coats looked alike , satin waistcoats were plain or embroidered , hair was long or short - you 'd have to study to tell apart those from the North and the South . Cigars clamped in teeth muffled greetings to friends ; here as elsewhere , importance came with raised voices and hurrying feet . No differences , no special virtue lay on the halls of the Congress . Voices which carried as far as Georgia or Maine were the voices of commonplace men . Maybe commonplace men were all there were in the world  --  anywhere , everywhere , commonplace men were warp and woof , the texture and tools , the means and the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach high enough . . . deep enough .. . The Negro clerk in Stevens ' office said that the man from Pennsylvaniawas on the Floor , and he offered to take them to the gallery . Men had come up the corduroy roads , from the gullied fields ; end the rich plantations of the South to meet other men from the restless , changing North here on this Floor . Simon stood at the hack of the gallery looking down , with hot questions in his eyes and P276his face still . . . . They sit at desks , they sit on desks , they move around , they walk up the aisles , calling to a friend while another man is speaking , they lounge as if asleep , they sit alert , commonplacemen moving against an ornate background of red and gold . Above them hangs a portrait of Lafayette ( two revolutions met in that man and he gave his blessing to both ) ; here speaks the will of the people . . . His eyes half closed . They were not what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit , mentally and physically , into the bar of the United States Hotel in Milledgeville . His lips stiffened . He sensed that the Negro clerk still stood behind him , and he turned his head to look at him . The hot questions still lay in his eyes . A smile came to the Negro 's face , and he looked down at the Floor . Simon said , " Do you come here often ? " The Negro answered , " Most times when lie 's on the Floor . " " Will he speak today ? " " Ca n't say . If he gets mad . " " Hush ! " voices said , and Simon leaned against the wall beside the Negro listening . . . I 've seen this bill tagging on to others , and I 've said my say before . . . " ( Simon looked at the clerk , who whispered , " Mr. Albert Smith of Mississippi . " ) " .. . but I 've got no objection to saying my say as often as necessary to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the South which knows about these things  --  but decent manhood  --  vigilant manhood ! " The Negro 's smile did not deepen , but a kind of joy came to his eyes . " That means x1 ' 11 be gettin ' up in a few minutes . " . .. it 'll mean freeing our slaves . It 'll mean more than that . It 'll mean that the rich will flee the country . Then the poor man clown in the sovereign state of Mississippi will see what his real fate is . And my colleagues from Georgia , South Carolina , every place where decent white men have a burden to bear , will shout amen . For they know what we know in Mississippi . Pass this wicked , blasphemous , crime-laden law and every Negro will insist on being treated like an equal . " ( He raised his voice above the shouts " Amen , amen ! " Sit down ! SIT DOWN . ) " He 'll make his son marry the white man 's daughter , and the white man 's son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as has marked the history of San Domingo . . . " Simon closed his eyes and leaned his head against the wall . AfterP277a moment the clerk touched his ann . Simon opened his lids wide enough to see the faintly troubled face . " I just thought I was back in Georgia , " he whispered , " homesick .. . Then the bile rose in his spirit , and he pushed open the door to the corridor . The clerk closed the door behind them and stood near by . Simon 's hands were dug in his pockets and his legs were wide spread ; fire burned in his eyes . " You come from Georgia ? " the clerk said . Simon did not hear him . " In God 's name , " Simon said , " are n't there any different words to use ? Out on the China Seas , would they use those same words ? " He saw the Negro clerk . " Why are you staring that way ? " " My Daddy came from Georgia too , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Simon , and held out his hand . But the pace of his thoughts was too swift for a pause . " I thought there Wright be something here  --  something here  --  but they use the same words . Maybe we 've got to scorch the whole earth and flood off the bastards and get us a new race of men . " The clerk opened the door to the gallery slightly . " He 's on his feet , " he said and pushed the door wider . Simon looked at him with angry eyes ; the clerk pointed with his head . Simon came into the gallery combative , a roar in his throat . Down the gallery , onto the Floor , his eyes traveled , to a tall , thin man in a brown-drab suit , with a grim face , and a black wig slightly askew . He stared at the tall , thin man , and there was rage in his brown , storming eyes . The clerk moved away from him , leaning against the wall at a short distance , the faint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riven-faced man was like a whip , a cold , clean lash through the air . " These Southern gentlemen , " he was saying , " like my honored colleague from Mississippi , have a well defined objective . They desire partly to intimidate Congress and partly to occupy its time so that no legislation can be matured obnoxious to Southern gentlemen . " During the present session we have been told , amid raving excitement , that if we dared to legislate a certain way , the South would teach the North a lesson . " The lash crackled . " Are the representativesof free men to be thus treated ? You have too often intimidatedCongress . You have more than frightened the tame North from its propriety and found doughfaces ' enough to be your tools . In this glorious country , where two-thirds of the people are free , P278we can say anything within these walls or beyond them with impunity , unless we speak in favor of human liberty . But that is ag-gression ! " He seemed barely to hear the boos , whistles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Negro clerk looked at Simon , his face wide in a smile , but Simon held white knuckles against his mouth , and his eyes were unblinking . The dry voice went on , when friends and enemies fell silent . " In this government , the subject has no rights . He is a naked slave , stripped of every right which God and nature gave him , and which the high spirit of our revolution declared inalienable . Who are the despots ? The rulers of the country  --  the sovereign people ! You and I , and sixteen millions are free , while we doom four million of our fellow men to perpetual bondage . Are we not despots such as history brands and God abhors ? " The noisy gallery shouted again . Thad was a darling ! The rising North  --  those who were twenty-one and Republicans simultaneously  --  loved him . The Negro clerk looked once more at Simon . Simon had not moved . A slow fire had kindled in his eyes , and he heard only one thing , saw only one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignored boos or cheers . With one hand against the back of his seat , he turned slowly so that his voice carried to all parts of the Hall . He paid no more attention to the exposed pistols of two colleagues than to the cheers in the gallery . " The honorable member from Virginia has said , Though we have been a numerical minority in the Union for fifty years , yet during that period we have managed to control the destinies of the Union . The records afford ample testimony of our superior energy and genius . ' " He sharpened his voice . " Sir , I do not complain of this statement . It is both candid and true . But I can not listen to the recital without feeling the burning blush of my countenance that the North , with her overwhelming millions of freedmen , has for half a century been tame and servile enough to submit to this arrogant rule . " His voice rose to a thin roar which was answered by other roars from the Floor and the gallery . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underlip thrust out . Simon bowed his head , excruciating excitement catching his throat . Stevens ' voice rose and outshouted the shouters .   " Our fathers repudiated the whole doctrine of the legal superiority of family or races and proclaimed the equality of man before the law . " He spoke through the interruptions on the Floor , through the Speaker 's pounding gavel . His voice rose higher withouteffort . " They were prevented by slavery from perfecting the superstructure whose foundations they had thus broadly laid . They consented to wait , but never relinquished the idea of its final completion . It is our duty to complete their work . This is not a white man 's government . ' To say so is political blasphemy , for it violates the fundamental principles of our gospel of liberty . This is man 's government , the government of all men alike . Equal rights to all is innate in every immortal being , no matter what the shape or color of the tabernacle which it inhabits . " Simon had no sound to make , no hands to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms strained across his chest , his eyes bound to the gaunt figure . Savanna looked up at him , tears in her eyes , but he did not see her . His mind was moving with a steady heat ; a throbbing beat in his temples ; his heart was swollen to a point of bursting . Life  --  that was what Stevens had said in words like the cracking of ice on a spring river  --  Life ! Come out of the darkness , let us have life . He went out of the gallery abruptly , leaving the clerk to hold the door for Savanna , and he strode down the corridor as if the spring freshets were running , the earth had wakened , the sap run again in the trees . The clerk ran ahead to lead the way , for that look in his eyes , that look ... one guessed , if he were a wise man , and the clerk was no fool . The clerk held open the door of Stevens ' office , but Simon passed by . The clerk called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Not now . Not now . " He needed the sunlight and the bright world . He came to the bend in the corridor just as the tall , drab , old man in the badly made wig limped into his path of flight . He steadied himself and would have gone on , but the closeness to the dour , vivid , bonybrowedface suddenly halted him . He said in a rush , " Thanks . Thanks for putting guts in my words again . Thanks for  --  for things you do n't know . " He went on . Stevens said sharply , " Young man ! " Simon came back slowly to the powerful , old man who was standinggrimly , his wig slightly askew . " I 'm not thanked for guts very often . What 's on your mind ? " Simon stood silent for a moment , looking clown at him , suckingP280at his lower lip . He said at length , like a boy , feeling for words , " I come from Georgia . I believed that words put together one way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proof before . That 's all . It meant a heap to me . " " From the South ? " Stevens said , with a flash from under his juttingbrows . " They breed them with hope in the South ? " " I reckoned you knew , or you would n't have spoken as you did . " Stevens was silent , his heavy underlip thrust out , his pale eyes so deep set under his brows that they might have been closed or open . Savanna drew near , and Stevens glanced at her swiftly . " There are either all slaves or all free men , North or South , " Stevens said . Then he added , " Would you call that fanaticism ? " Rough hair fell over Simon 's brow , bringing a youthful , undilutedeagerness to his expression . He laughed shortly , " I 've been reared with fanatics . " Stevens had a straight , grim smile that somehow lighted his face . " Man , " he said softly , " do n't you know the ocean bed is shifting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why , the old world 's most clone with and the new world 's being born . That 's the only sign of the true fanatic . " Simon said with musing lips , " That 's what I heard , standing in the gallery . I reckoned I had n't heard straight . " Stevens ' voice was dry . He turned away toward his office . " You heard straight enough . Carry the glad news to Georgia . " Simon said nothing and Stevens hesitated after he had taken a few steps . Savanna stood grave and handsome , her gloved hands tightly clasped above her wide skirts , her eyes like dark , breaking skies . Simon said to the turned head of Stevens , " Good news comes at a pike 's end when men are hog-tied and gagged . They 'll believe only the thing that 's said over and over until it sounds like somethingfamiliar . " Stevens ' head turned and his pale , piercing eyes measured the look on Simon 's face . The world closed in with those eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of feet on the corridor floor , the dark , vivid graveness of Savanna were palpable things , frames for this man of the cadaverous face and the power . " Then , " Stevens said , " in God 's name , learn a new language ! " His pale eyes flashed like a sudden , thin knife . " Teach Smith of Mississippi a new language . " He laughed sharply with a hard compactpassion . " He speaks for the slaveless . " He faced Simon with aP281sudden , deep searching . " Can I say it to you ? There 's a sight more to the fight than rousing the slaveless . New men must be found with old hopes , old faiths in new frames . " His pale eyes thrust at Simon . " Georgia 's a mighty small place . " Simon stirred and passed his hand over his eyes . " A mighty small place . . . Stevens did not speak for a minute . He looked at Savanna who had a special , new light in her face , he looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he looked at Simon 's loweredhead . He spoke softly to the lowered , dark head . " Look farther than Georgia . Look as far as Russia . Watch when the serfs there go free . Watch England . She 's got bound mill workers . Watch Italy . She 's got bound peasants . Watch Germany . She 's got bound thinkers . Watch for some of them to move . Watch Northern workingmen . One of them will stir and then the whole mass will shake . Then you 'll hear the new language no matter who speaks the words . " Simon lifted his eyes but he did not move . They stood there silent , the three , not looking at one another , bound by their silence . Then Stevens raised his eyes and said with a half smile , " The Goddessof Liberty is represented in ancient statues as a very nice little goddess , but very small . I want her to grow  --  to put on the habilimentsof mature age  --  until she can embrace every tribe and every human being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer . He was looking at the intangible but palpable , the heart and the spirit , the mind and the strength . A light had lasted since the beginning of man ; how long that was he could not tell . It did not matter . He was alive because he was a part of it . Five minutes of this living was life . All else was sloughed off . He reckoned this liveness would endure until Gabriel 's trumpet . He reckoned this was without beginning or end . In love with the power of life , and the glory , in love with the vastness and passionand beauty , in love with the strength and vigor and endlessness . . . . " Learn guile , man , " Stevens was saying with a smile . " Your face gives you away . " He held out his hand . " Come back some day and tell me how Georgia goes . " Simon took his hand . " I have a letter here for you . Although I do n't know what it says . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he read P282it . The outthrust lower lip became a smile . " It says , Shall we trust him ? ' " He surveyed Simon and turned his eyes to Savanna , and the  --  smile grew . " What shall I say ? " He took a pencil from his pocket , and backed Goodloe 's letter against the wall . " I 'll answer and say , His face gives him away . You had better trust him . ' " He wrote a few words and read them aloud . " Open up the wide world for Simon Bliss . ' " He looked at Savanna , " And those whom he trusts . ' " Simon 's brown eyes were articulate , but his mouth slow of speech . " I reckon I have seen the world . I can go home . " Stevens smiled , his eyes cool . " Go back to Goodloe . He 's a Southernman . He 'll want to shake hands . " His handclasp was strong and he looked from one to the other for a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Make sure that it 's yours . " Goodloe was pleased when he looked up from the letter , geniality warmed his pale face . " One day we 'll be prouder than sin that we 're Southerners . " He leaned against the side of his desk , stroking his whiskers against the back of his hand , smiling . " I 'll take you where I know that they are . . . " " Who ? " Simon asked . " Men who 'll tell you some of the rules of this war . " He locked up his desk , put on his hat and led them into the late afternoon . Simon looked back through the door , and saw the coloredboy watching them . He raised his hand and a smile came to the colored boy 's face , a smile that grew until presently it filled all his face . Washington in late afternoon felt coolness come from the river . Crying hucksters had an urgency in their voices which came with the end of the clay . Flocks of geese squawked as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rain had made mud of PennsylvaniaAvenue the night before and a day of vehicles had churned it into a thick consistency , but the marble buildings rose detached and shining . Some clay it would be a beautiful city . . . if marble held out and the geese and hogs were fenced in . Simon trudged along , his hands in his pockets . Savanna held up her skirts and minded the mud , one hand through Simon 's arm . His voice was stubborn . " It ca n't be that slavery rules everything here like you said , if one man can stand up and say , This is not a white maws government . To say so is to violate the principles of our gospel of P283liberty . ' That must mean that slavery 's got a bullet in its backside . " Goodloe said musingly , " Thad is a man without fear . That is not , common . Ben Wade in the Senate 's a good fighter . So is Sumner , And Josh Giddings could raise almighty hell . But Josh was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was in Congress . Oh , they 're good men all right . But they are n't enough . To light slavery takes passion . Too many business men sit as Free Soilers . " He steadied a trouserless Negro child pursuing a piglet . " I published a book of statistics once , before Helper 's book came along , but statisticiansand business men will never shake slavery . You 've got to believe in freedom the same way you believe in God . Maybe they 're one and the same . " " I reckon they are . " They turned into F Street , past the post office which rose from a fringe of shacks and shanties , and Goodloe gave an extra hand to Savanna across a muddy trap in the road . " Here 's Bigelow 's place . " He stood on the steps of the weathered , unpainted , two-story building , and faced them with a grave pause , looking at them until a half smile came to his face . " In here , " he said , " they drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves here . The man who walks in here has the army , the police force , and the militia ranged up against him . Are you willing to go in ? " Simon laughed . " Open the door ! " Goodloe pulled the bell handle and continued to watch them , half smiling . After a moment or two the door was drawn back parr way , with a shading of caution and guilelessness . " Friends , John , " Daniel Goodloe said quietly . The little man looked around the side of the door , showing his round , pale face with gray chin whiskers . His eyes were blue and canny . They turned from the Blisses to Goodloe . Goodloe pushed gently against the door . " Thad Stevens and I both vouch for them . Let 's have a little Ohio hos pitality . " John Bigelow 's voice held a last warning . " Ross and Redpath are here . " Goodloe looked swiftly at Simon and laughed . " Good ! " They came into a narrow , dark hall , stumbling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They heard Bigelow hurrying ahead in the darkness , and Simon held Savanna , his hands on her arms , until their eyes grew accustomed to the dark . They could hear Goodloe's voice , hollow in the closed passageway , " You 're keeping Redpath and Ross under cover ? " " Jehoshaphat  --  yes . " John Bigelow reached a door , and light came into the hall . Simonsaw over Savanna 's head into a dusky room . A woman sat by the fireplace , rocking . She did not lift her head . She merely drew her shawl a little closer and went on rocking . By the window a tall , bearded man stood with his back to the twilight , hands pressed against the sill , tautness in his dark silhouette . By the cold stove stood a stocky man , a dead match to his pipe , tensenessin the turn of his head . " All right , " said John Bigelow shrilly , " no danger , boys . " Daniel Goodloe shook hands with the woman . " What will Mr. and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " John Bigelow lighted a lamp . The man by the window drew the curtains . In the soft light , Simon saw a portly man with thinninghair and trimmed beard . Bigelow , his quick hands never still , cried shrilly , " South Carolina papers are putting their fingers pretty close to Ross . We 're being cautious . Maw , this is Mr. and Miz Bliss , and Mr. and Miz Bliss , this is my wife and Mr. Redpath and Ross . " " Howdy , " said Simon with a nod , his eyes shiny . " Howdy , " said the portly man by the window , " I 'm Ross . " The man by the stove did not take the pipe from his mouth but his hard black eyes roved from the cut of their clothes , the shape of their shoes , to the expression of their faces , and although Simon had an uneasy desire to avoid him , Savanna sat down where she could returnstare for stare . Daniel Goodloe said to the room , " Simon Bliss is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into Africa . Thad Stevens and I both say teach him the ropes even though he does say You-all . ' I 've got to go over to Georgetown to talk to Beecher who 's come into town . " Simon had no time for two things in his mind . He took no noticeof Daniel Goodloe 's departure . Mrs. Bigelow stopped her rockingabruptly and went into the kitchen . Bigelow jerked his head after her and said with a chuckle , " We always figure that Maw in the rocking chair looks kinda respectable if trouble should bust through the door . " Ross leaned across the back of the chair . " Where do you-all come from ? " he asked , singing his words like a Southerner . P285Simon grinned . " Reckon from pretty near your folks  --  with that kind of talk . " Ross ' red lips and white teeth showed through his beard . " I 've been practicing up Georgia speech . How does it sound ? " " Sounds better'n a Georgia cracker 's , " he answered , still grinning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his veined hand knuckled against the table . " He ca n't talk like an Ohioan though . But that 's too close to home . He 'd scorn that . " Ross still smiled , white teeth shining through his beard . " I 'm a Canadian , gentlemen . I ca n't sound like a crowd of hobbledehoys from Ohio . " Little Bigelow chuckled and patted a pillow to put behind Savanna . Then he sat down in a chair under the lamp and peered at Simon through the upper part of his spectacles . " So you 're thinking of being a station-master on the underground line ? " Simon brushed back his hair with the quick gesture of excitement , " Reckon I 'll have to find out first what it offers to a fellow who 's tired of waitin ' and talkin ' . " Bigelow 's round eyes did not blink . " You do n't get to be a station-master on the underground line the way you get to be a doctor or a lawyer , " he said mildly . Savanna caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own eyes narrowed a little . Ross examined his fleshy smooth hands and said softly , " There are some mighty fine chaps in the business , from Richmond to Birmingham . " Simon considered him obliquely . " For a fact ? You talked to them ? " " Man to man . With the shutters closed . " " In Georgia too ? " " Savannah , Columbus , Macon . " Simon whistled and glanced at Savanna . Her dark eyes opened wide . " What kind of men , sir ? " she asked . " Little men . " Ross ' clasped hands looked soft and pliant against the dark horsehair chair . " Tailors , preacher or two . Porters . Hodcarriers , coachmen . Most of them black . " Simon laughed . " Were you scared of the white ones ? " " No . But they lay quietly . Only the blacks knew them . " " Tell him how it goes , " John Bigelow said , tilting his chair back , his nondescript face placid in the lamplight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the underground P286is : Strike while you can . " The back of a gentle hand brushed his beard softly . " I 'm a doctor . In Canada I read Uncle Tom 's Cabin , and after I read it , I talked to refugee slaves . They told me one thing . Go South . Talk about freedom . ' They told me the same thing in Boston . Here in Washington , Bigelow gave me a few lessons , and beginning at Richmond , I tested them out . A colored preacher brought me forty-two Negroes one night . I told them why I had come , and how they could get to the North . Nine came back the next Sunday night . I gave them a few dollars , compasses , knives , pistols , food , and directions . They all got through . In Richmond , a white station-keeper told me that border slave states did n't need me as much as the ones farther South . He passed me , in reverse , to a white man near the Dismal Swamp . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preservatives , and an ornithological look in my eyes allowed me to go far afield . When I talked to slaves , I was asking scientific advice . No one would know that I slipped a little to them . I equipped eleven for the journey North . " Savanna held her lower lip with her teeth . When Joe asked if he 'd surely make it , she had said Yes . She had never believed anything else . Yes was yes . She bowed her head . She wondered if she 'd ever forget the way his hand had reached like a child for her skirts . Yes was yes . She still believed in it . " I went to South Carolina and then Mississippi , " the fine voice went on . " In Vicksburg , whenever I returned from neighboring plantations , I had fine botanical specimens to show . No one seemed . to relate those botanical specimens with the disappearance of slaves many miles off . " The smile faded from his lips . The soft hand went again to his beard . " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine law to break . I found a deep satisfaction in superseding that law with the Higher one . " " I helped a slave escape , " Simon said with a little smile . Ross ' laugh was warm . " A Higher Law man , too . " " And saw another one caught . " They were silent . The third voice , when it fell bluntly into the silence , was coarse and angry . " Unless you carry the war into Africa , you can give up your trying ! " Simon looked at James Redpath , straddling the chair , and the hard black eyes stared back with no friendliness . Simon turned to Ross and to John Bigelow who sat with half closed eyes in his tilted chair .   " He means  --  invasion , " Ross said gently . " Storm the armed for tress and drag out the black man at the point of a gun . " Simon was silent , studying his clenched hands . " Some men are antislavery in the South because they fear for the Union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 'll have guns whether you want them or not , " Redpath said , striking a match for his pipe , " and the goddam Union can go up in smoke . " Simon felt a hot flush of anger . " That 's not good talkin ' . " Redpath spoke hoarsely . " We 've got a Union that 's based onslavery . Disunion 's not too big a price to pay to get rid of slavery . " Simon smiled faintly . " I reckon they 'd understand you down inMilledgeville . " Little Bigelow spoke diffidently , " We 've been at war for nearly thirty years . Some folks ca n't get that straight . It 's no good acting like we ai n't . " " Down in the South , " Simon mused , " men like me put great faith in the power of voting . If we could set aside the laws that keep the poor slaveless men from voting , we think . . . " ... It 's something more than slaveless and slave-owners , the thin lips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopes . It 's old faith in new frames . Simon was silent for a moment , then his eyes went to Redpath . " When you go into the South  --  what happens ? " " Every slave we take away weakens slavery . Multiply it by thousands  --  fiftymillion dollars ' worth have escaped to the North . Money talks . The South is on fire . It set itself on fire , but we do n't intend to put out the flames . " " If one slave escapes .. . " Six more are restless . Maybe two will strike out . " A live spark from the pipe in his hand burned a pinpoint in his trousers , but he paid no attention . Savanna 's eyes were swampy . " My Ma remembers a slave uprisingwhen she was a girl . We do n't want those things . " Redpath looked at her , his eyes glittering . " You 'd call them heroes , ma'am , if they were white men fighting for themselves in a strange land . " She was stubborn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riding to raise the alarm . " His teeth were still clenched on his pipe . " Lots of other folks P288have been scared ' sides your Ma . They 'll keep on being scared as long as they 've got a war on their hands . " " Tough talk , " Simon said , the knuckles of his hand showing white . " I 'd arm every black , " Redpath said , slow smoke curling his face . " I 'd teach them tactics and strategy . I 'd watch till they had built up a leader like Moses or Joshua and marched out of Egypt to the rattle of guns . " " Tough talk , " Simon said again uneasily . " That day wo n't come . " Redpath stirred in his chair and knocked his pipe against the stove . " It might , " he said , a gleam in his eye . " I knew an old feller in Kansas . He used to say around the camp fire at night , I 'm going to carry the war into Africa . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' He had his eyes fixed on the Virginia mountains . He 'd say , God has given the strength of the mountains to freedom . ' Old John Brown knows the stakes and the handicaps . Arm the slave , ' he 'd say , and you make him a man .

" I 'm a newspaper man . I talked to blacks everywhere I went , Virginia , the Carolinas , Alabama . Ninety-nine of a hundred wanted to be free . It was n't fear of being caught kept them from running away , it was not knowing North from South . I had a bag of cheap compasses . I gave them all one .

Ross spoke in his low , genteel voice . " Maybe you do n't know your own South ? " The toe of Simon 's shoe went slowly back and forth across a worn spot . " I do n't want cannon shootin ' across Georgia or risin ' slaves burnin ' down my Pa-in-law 's house , " he said in a muffled voice . Redpath bit on his pipe and showed his teeth again . His hard black eyes narrowed . " Maybe you 're not heart and soul . . . " There are alternatives , " Ross said softly , sitting down beside Savannaon the horsehair sofa . " The Underground Railroad siphons some of those heroes out of the South . " Simon 's eyes went back to the worn spot on the carpet , and he P289said nothing . The silence deepened . Redpath said suddenly , " Jesus Christ ! " Simon looked at him . Then he looked at little Bigelow , his hands crossed on his stomach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face was watchful , that even his guilelessness was an art . He felt suddenly cold , as if these men were more alien than he imagined . He gripped his hands together , and his toe went back and forth across the worn spot . He did not look at them when he said , " A station 's got comfortable accommodations ? I hang out a sign ? I put an advertisement in the paper ? " He looked up suddenly . " Then I wait for the patrol ? " Bigelow laughed a little . " You wo n't have long to wait . " They were silent again . Simon looked from face to face . " Thenwhat ? " he demanded . "  --  if I do n't want slaves shakin ' guns ? " " God damn Southerners ! " Redpath rose up violently . Little Bigelow brought down his tilted chair sharply . " Do you want to know ? " he said . " Square and honest ? " " That 's why I came . " " It 's no fancy dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no DeadEyeDick stuff . But you know that . " He looked up to the eyed command of his wife in the doorway , and rose . " Supper , folks . A station-master needs only a few things . A good hiding place . A face that do n't give him away . Distrust of his own wife . The knack of thinking fast . I 'm a sewing-machine salesman . Moved from Ohio . " He led them to the dining room . " I did n't set out to be a full-time abolitionist , but some things you ca n't stand . A hired woman of ours said her daughter was set to be sold . I bought her a ticket on the steam railroad and seen her off to Canada . Word kinda got around after that . Guess Maw wants you to sit there , Mr. Bliss . " He tucked his napkin into his collar and spread it out to cover his waistcoat . Savanna brought in one tureen and Mrs. Bigelow the other . " Where 's Charlie , Maw ? " he asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back half an hour ago , " his wife answered calmly . " I just told him it was time to wash up . " " Charlie rides our underground train , " he said , beaming . He used his spoon happily and turned a bright eye on Simon . " 1 ' 11 show you a train after supper . " He stirred his soup silently for a moment . " An underground station-keeper do n't know for sure five P290minutes ahead of time what he 's going to do . But he knows he das n't make a mistake . He makes one mistake and he goes back to being a sewing-machine salesman when he gets out of jail . " Charlie came in , a lean Negro with an unsmiling face . He slid into the place beside Ross . " Everything hunky-dory ? " Bigelow asked , holding a steaming spoon steady . Charlie grinned swiftly . " Sure . Miz Carroll says they 'll be headin ' towards Pennsylvania before mornin ' . " " Heard there were deputies on the Anacostia road . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wagon from gettin ' through . " Charlie filled his plate with soup , his expression unchanged . " If they did . . . ? " Simon asked . Charlie looked up swiftly . " They would n't , " he said , and the subject was ended . " Mighty interesting business , " Bigelow observed , with a look over his glasses at Simon . " And this Miz Carroll ? " " Old lady . She 's mighty religious . Got a Bible verse for every lick she does . " He blew softly on his soup . " I figure she 's passed on nigh a hundred black folks . " Simon stirred his soup steadily . " And beyond Miz Carroll ? " " A feller . Miz Carroll would n't tell me his name even if I asked . But I would n't ask . " He took off his glasses and laid them on the table away from the steaming soup . " In this business we take care to know only the feller north and south of us . Then if one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one point . " Simon 's eyes went around the table . There was a sudden fire and glory in his face . " You mean there are folks stretched one right after the other , waiting . . . Southern folks ? " " Certainly . We do n't know who they are , but they 're there . Behindus and ahead of us . All kinds of folks . Some of them would surprise you . " Bigelow ran a piece of bread inside his soup plate . " The line grows kinda thin some places South  --  maybe it goes undergroundfor sure  --  mostly in black fellas ' hands like Ross told you , but it 's there . Texas to Virginia . We do n't ask questions . " Simon sat in silence for a moment , then his hand came down , soft and mighty , on the table . " Behind you and before you , and up and down the country . " He thought of this for a moment , his face P291holding the wonder and glory . Then he looked up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I were the only fellers in the whole South . Now , what do you think of that ? " The Negro looked up swiftly , a quick , sharp smile in his eyes . Redpath was racing to finish his soup . He jerked his head toward Simon . " Get him fixed up before the election rush if he 's so doge gone sold on the business . " Bigelow put on his glasses again . " The black fellers did n't wait on us in ' 56 . No , sir . " Redpath exchanged his soup plate for a meat plate . " I met an old fellow in ' 56 , out on the Iowa underground . Must have been near sixty . Said he had wanted all his life to be free . When his master got to hell-ing and damn-ing Fremont for President , he figuredFremont was his medicine , but Fremont was defeated , so he lit out for himself . He was a mighty tired old man , but , Christ , he was happy ! " " They wo n't get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " We 'll teach ' em that Seward 's a good name , " Redpath answered , grinning suddenly . " It 'll be Seward then ? " Simon asked . " Who else has a chance ? " " The feller that debated with Douglas . . . " Little Bigelow 's folded hands came to rest against the edge of the table . " Holy Jesus ! " Redpath said . " We want a feller who can get votes ! " " I read those debates , " Bigelow said dreamily . " It seemed as though that Lincoln said a lot of good things . " Redpath 's eyes gleamed over his raised coffee cup . " We mean to elect a President this time . We 're through with being pushed around . " After supper , John Bigelow said to Simon , " Do you want to see the train ? " And Simon said , " Lead me to it ! " " Get a light , Charlie , and , Miz Bliss , you mind the yard steps . " Bigelow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's just smart . " In the shed an open wagon stood , paint-peeled but sturdy . " See , it 's just like an ordinary wagon . Little low-slung maybe , but . . . Show them , Charlie ! " Charlie jumped into the wagon . His fingers slid between two planks . He raised up the plank . Savanna stood on her tiptoes . " A P292false bottom ? " she said to Simon , her eyes shiny . Simon nodded , with thrust-out lips , nodded slowly and thoughtfully . " That 's mighty handy . Now  --  how  --  Charlie ? Very neat . Reckon I could use one of those myself . " " It 's had good wear . " Bigelow fitted the planks in again carefully . " Carried a slave of Bob Toombs in here once , " he chuckled . " This here 's the meeting place for lines farther South . Five or six fellers passed through from Georgia in the last few months . " " What else will you show me ? " Simon demanded . Bigelow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'll show you the room Charlie fixed up . " They went through the house and up the stairs . They stood in a room . " See anything funny ? " Bigelow asked eagerly . Simon opened a closet and tapped the walls . " You 'll never find it , " Bigelow cried , " because wherever you tap , there 'll be another room anyway . " He felt along the molding insidethe closet and drew down the side of the wall . Simon crept in . His voice came back muffled . " That Charlie ! He 's the one they ought to catch and then their worries would be over . " Bigelow called back happily . " Business has picked up a lot since we got this room . Charlie 's mighty proud of it . A lot of his friends come to see it . " Simon emerged and stood silently for a moment , his head bent before the low ceiling . " This is no game , " he said . " This is life and death . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the window . " I reckon we pray for something else every time we lift our hands , " he said . " But the Lord makes the price high .. . so as to make us hold it real precious . " In the parlor , Bigelow said , " You can see for yourself that getting freedom in this way is old stuff . Religious folks had to hide away once , same as black fellers . And so did the folks who did n't like kings . " " Christ ! " Redpath cried , " we did n't have time for fancy rooms in Kansas . We just shot it out . " Bigelow rocked in his chair , hands clasped across his middle , and did not heed the interruption . " And I 'll bet you this old stuff will be used again . Over and over again . By other people , I 'll bet you  --  heaps of times  --  in places we do n't even guess of . " Ross leaned his elbow on the mantelpiece beside the dried hy- P293drangeas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft . " And there 'll always be odd crews to run the underground lines . " The sweep of his hand included them all . " Like Redpath , able to shoot border ruffians from a galloping horse 's back , or Bigelowwho ought to be selling his sewing machines and tending hydrangeasback in Ohio , or you , straight out of the mountains of Georgia , who should be attending to the advice of the planters , or  --  I  --  " His hand went to his silk cravat , and his teeth gleamed for a moment . " But that 's our strong point , I fancy . " He ran his fingers slowly up and down the ribbon of his pince-nez ; his bright eyes were thoughtful . To Simon he said , " I learned about a very interestingnew world in New York from Garibaldi 's men and Karl Marx 's men . You know who they are ? No ? Well , they 're refugees , because they fancy a new kind of future . They fill the cafes , they talk you deaf , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . They give you man in totality . They 're willing to die for the black man  --  not because he 's black but because he 's a part of that total world . They make ordinary things seem different  --  one Italian fellow said peasants of Italy knew the story of Uncle Tom like the Bible because they knew what it meant . " Redpath turned abruptly to Simon . " Guns are going off all over that world , and antislavery men have got to draw the first bead . Listen .. . Little Bigelow ceased his rocking . " That Illinois fellow said last year , debating with Douglas , Let 's discard these things and unite as one people until we shall once more stand up and declare that ALL MEN are created equal . ' " He glanced at Savanna . " I 'll settle for that fellow if he keeps on thataway . " Redpath moved impatiently . " Listen , " he said , " I 've seen ' em riding with guns blazing across Kansas plains . Guns 'll have the last word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the week they saw Daniel Goodloe again . " Going back to Georgia ? " Goodloe asked . " Going back . " " Did we show you some things ? " " Show me  --  " Simon cried , " if I learned only one thing  --  that I 'm glad to be alive  --  I learned all I need . " Daniel Goodloe smiled slowly . " I 'll tell Thad Stevens that . I think he 'll be pleased . "   " Tell him , too , to be patient . We 're cut off down there , but well fight through somehow . But not war  --  tell him not to talk about war . " " Not war ? Certainly  --  we 'll try the ballot box first . " Savanna said , " You tell him for me that I 'm not going back meek and mild . I 'm going to speak right up the way I always have . You tell him he can count on that too . " Daniel Goodloe answered , " I 'll tell him that also , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " P295BY COBBLED ROADS , BY CORDUROY ROADS , BY RED DIRT ROADS ; THROUGHthe uplands of North Carolina , along the ridge of a world of wide brown fields and desolate men , through the great pine forests , past the weathered huts and the wagon camps in the wild lands , by the great falls of Tallulah , with the stage horn winding in the narrow defiles of the road , Savanna and Simon came back to Georgia . Harry drove up from Bonaventura and met them in Athens , for nothing would do but that Savanna must have her new child where her Ma could take care of her . A baby , born comfortably in a feather bed , with Mammy and Ma waiting on her slightest call .. . yet she reckoned she 'd always love her first baby best , love it till death them united . She saw the plantation without sentiment but also without the shock of her earlier return . Here was the weathered and wearied home of hard-working people , and those people were the bone of herself and her child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had not come to tell them so . She had come to embrace them , and she kissed Ma and Pa and Grandpa and Nance , she embraced Dolly and the kitchen children , she shook hands with Dodie and Jupe and looked toward the fields and the woods for the others . She laughed and cried , and hugged Nance and Grandpa three times for the others ' two . She widened the circle for Simon when she saw him kissing and shaking hands and laughing with this abundant homecoming . When she had last come to Bonaventura , she had come with the horror of Polio upon her , a child 's death upon her , a fugitive 's return upon her . Now she came home with Simon and Simon 's child , and a new world within her heart and mind . These were the things she knew and loved ; here her remembrances would lie . Ma cried openly , tears running down her thin face , and when Simon kissed her and teased her by holding her away from Savanna , she yearned from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he pecked twice at Savanna 's cheeks , but a repose seemed to come into his face , jollity into his eyes ; his voice became subtly and wonderfully hearty . He shouted at Harry , " Git along with you ! What you waitin ' for ? Git along ! " But it was the friendly shout of a man who must increase the volume of sound about him to show his happiness . Harry laughed , cracked his whip high , and shouted back to Savanna , " ' By , Miss Vanny ! Got business in Lexington . But I 'll be back . " " Sassy coon , " her Pa said without rancor , and then clapped his hands and shuffled his shoes at the brown children who were crowdingaround the visitors . He recognized the rights of Nance and Grandpa . He kept their feet uncluttered by the children at the same time that he shouted at Jupe to take the baggage into the house , and shouted at Newton to get started on the second picking in the west field first thing tomorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , the immemorialsmell that brought back Savanna 's first love , first devotion , if she but closed her eyes . They held each other close ; in Savanna 's childhood they had ceased to rely on words . And with Grandpa words were unnecessary also . Even Simon found that hands clasped and arm flung across shoulder said , You 've come . I 've come . Good . Grandpa looked older and thinner , and there was a transparency in his face . But it was not the transparency of an old man being dematerialized , but the quality which comes when words and emotionshave been winnowed , thoughts have been sharpened to a breath 's point , life and living are clearer than a crystal ball . How beautiful , one heart could say to another , how close to life . Simon pushed Grandpa 's rolling chair toward the house , and Dodie walked beside it , saying gently , " We 're anxious to hear , Mr. Simon , all the things you got to tell . " Ma clung to Savanna , leaned upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been restored . She talked incessantly , with a nervous energy that spread itself to Dodie and Nance , to Pa , even to Simon . She lingered on no thought for long , no heaviness burdened her voice . " She 's shettin ' herself of worriment , " Nance said when they stood alone for a moment in the guest room . " Worriment ? " Savanna repeated . " Somethin ' in the air , maybe , or maybe the same old thing . " P297Grandpa said , " Life could n't be different here . What have we got to make it different ? " " Grandpa ! " Savanna cried . " Any cause for difference , Mammy ? " he asked , opening and closinghis long thin hands on the arms of his chair . " No , sir , " Nance said , not looking up from Savanna 's open box . Through the window , Savanna saw Simon walking with Pa toward the barn where Newton stood awaiting them . " Grandpa , talk to Simon . " " What do you think I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ? " She laughed and leaned out the window . " Home . . . it 's queer , Grandpa . It still seems like home . " Grandpa did not answer . After awhile he said with a laugh deep in his throat , " That 's what they count on . " She looked at him from the window . " They , ' Grandpa ? " " Just they '  --  a big word . " She came to sit beside him . " I 've got faith in something now , Grandpa . I 've got my eyes wide open . " He looked at her from under his drooped lids and smiled faintly , but said nothing . " I do n't need to be jolted by things . I 've come home to have my baby here . That means I 'm not scared of this place any more . " Grandpa 's chin rested against his loose string tic , and the veins on his hands were blue ridges . But the smile still tightened his lips . " Scared of Pa and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? " Irony hardened in his voice . " Have done with such unnatural feelings , Vanny . " Nance said , with only a swift temporary lift of her head , " I hear yer Ma comin ' . " " Grandpa , " Savanna said with an odd desperation in her voice , " I want to feel good about this home until after my baby is born . " Ma was carrying a tray with coffee and cakes . " I laced the coffee just a mite , " she said , " to take the joltin ' of that buggy out of your bones . Oh , my child , my child . . . Pa and Grandpa and Ma wanted to know about Washington . It was an unfailing wonder . Their child and her husband had been all the way to Washington and seen marvels past belief . A capitol without a dome , the Pres-i-dent from afar , Aleck Stephens hobblin ' P298along like a little lame duck . Neighbors came by that afternoon to hang over the fence and ask about Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the columns set ready to hold up the capitol building , the legislators whose hands had been shaken , the gold clocks and the eagles which looked down on the Congressmen . Simon said only one thing at this time to Grandpa and Pa . " Up there you 're close to the North , " he said , " and you catch some glimpses without even lookin ' . It makes you think . They 've got a cable that looks like it will span the world . They 've got ships coveringthe seven seas . They 've got roads that go smack to the Pacific . They 've got railroads that must run every which-way like a web . They 've got factories , springin ' up like toadstools , and you can hear industry roaring at you from every direction  --  but the South . They 've got a population growin ' by leaps and bounds . " He added after a moment , " I just wondered sometimes where we be-longed . " Pa hiked his chair forward , and squinted his eyes at the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his glass of sangaree , " do n't get notions , you feller . " He turned his head suddenly and looked sharply at Simon , the crisscross lines of his weathered skin like the plow marks on a field . " Belong ? Say ! We are the United States ! " Ma had moved candles onto the table , and polished up the Savannahsilver so that you could see your face as plain as in a mirror . The soup and the roast and the vegetables were better than any in the whole state  --  that 's what Pa said . And Pa sang because , somehow , this night the whole world was round and right . " I love little Willie , I do , Mama , I love little Willie , I do , ha-ha ! I love little Willie , but do n't tell Pa , ' Cause he would n't like it at all , Mama . " The chariot is coming , it is , Mama , The chariot is coming , it is , ha-ha ! The chariot is coming , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like it at all , Mama . " The voices were gay but they became gayer . Pa resembled Grandpa in the guttering light ; he was beating out the time with his finger and the fork , and drawing everyone into the song , even Dolly who was waiting on the table . About Ma 's eyes and in the P299tone of her voice was a touch of hysteria , the kind of hysteria that comes when the voice is relaxed , the thoughts slip ever so slightly into a world with wide corners , and the hardened and veined hand holds a glass of wine just as it did long ago when Savannah was a city and not a child of her flesh . That child of her flesh felt a joy move in her , as if her unborn had stirred with expectancy . She and her baby had come home , had come home . She felt a peace that was like tears . She leaned her cheek on her hand and smiled with lowered lids . Dolly moved behind them , her white teeth breaking through her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a syncopated sound on the floor . With the third helping of chicken , Ma told a joke , an attenuatedjoke that needed explanation , and by the time of the squash pies , Nance had come from the kitchen to stand in the doorway and laugh with silent shoulder-shaking , while Eva crept up the hall behind her to giggle out of sight . Ma loved Simon . For the first time , she genuinely loved Simon , because with the progress of the meal , and after Pa had called for " cawn , " he told tall tales , which Pa matched and he topped . Ma loved to laugh . She remembered suddenly why she had married Tom . Sitting at the head of the table , the candlelight took time from his face , deflected a gleam into his eye , gave assurance to his hand as it lay on the table , gave breadth to his narrow shoulders , and she remembered why she had married him . It was not an impressive reason , but it had done for her then , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled a little , her eyes lowered to the wine , her thin underlip overlappingher upper . Pa , with a sly , swift look about the table , told a story that was intended to make Ma blush . " Recollect right well Miss Hallie Inchum wuz the plumb-gonedst old maid ever seen in the county . But come nights with full moons , Miss Hallie 'd get out there in the fields and wail like a hound dog , ' I want a man . ' First thing you know . . . " Tom Don ! " Ma gasped . In the darkness a horse galloped down the road , and the sound of its hoofs grew faint as it passed over the hills. " . . . that blamed journeyman . . . " Pa was bland , shooting sly glances at Ma and Grandpa , " come over the road in the full of the moon . Now Miss Hallie . . .   " Tom Dorr , for shame ! " Ma said with no anger in her voice . She drank the last of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Happiness had soothed and fattened her face . Her eyelidswere heavy with joy and good food . " You wo n't get a soul to listen to your bad stories but Grandpa . " Her hand moved out and closed over Simon 's . " Simon here 's got no time to waste in such sin . " Simon looked at her , gaiety suffusing his face . She did not look at him , but her hand lay on his . Pa lowered his voice , but his eyes were still merry . He told his story ostentatiously to Grandpa , keeping his eyes on the others . " Ai n't worse'n you hear in Washington . . . So when they come to bring back the journeyman 's cart in the morning . . . " Grandpa guffawed and Simon laughed in spite of himself . " ... and there was Miss Hallie . " Out in the night the horse was heard again . The sound of the horse pleased those who gave heed . It embraced the dark night with the curve of live men . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her chair , and her eyes and her ears shut out the room and became as wide as the darkness and as listening as the still earth . Nance filled up the coffee cups again , and Pa reached for the " cawn . " He sang under his breath : " He wrote me a letter , he did , Mama . He wrote me a letter , he did , ha-ha ! .. . Oh life , bountiful and beautiful .. . Outside in the darkness , the horse stopped at the hitching post . Dolly , with a glance through the dark window , went to the door . Pa heard a voice . " That you , Dan Masters ? " he called . " Hey  --  come in and hear about Washington ! " But Dolly appeared in the door , the gesture of her little hand peremptory . " He sez he got t ' talk t ' you . Cai n't wait on nothin ' . " Pa staggered a little when he got up from the table . He had been sitting too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went unsteadily toward the door . Grandpa did not cease smiling . Savannasaid , " Does Evvie 's Pa figger he can do some matchmakin ' here ? " and giggled . Pa reappeared abruptly . His face was not the face of the man who had gone from the room . " Simon ! " he said sharply . Ma did not linger in the past . Lifting her head swiftly , the hollowsappeared under her eyes again . " What 's Dan Masters want ? " Pa said , " Simon ! " more sharply , although Simon had risen and P301was halfway across the room . Ma 's voice was thin and relentless . " What does Dan Masters want ? Tell me , Tom ! " Pa hesitated and then came into the room . He came slowly until he reached the table . He pressed a knuckled fist against the cloth . They saw Dan Masters then , for he came from the hall . Dan Masterswas a big man with an unshaven jowl , an unhappy man , movingas if a stranger in this familiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouser leg which had been hitched up by his riding . He listened to Pa with downcast eyes , a muscular waveringline cutting his soft jowls . " It 's Harry , " Pa said , "  --  they 've got Harry in jail . " Ma did not hesitate . " ' Tai n't so ! " she cried . Grandpa swung his chair around . " What kind of news are you bringin ' , Dan Masters ? " " I do n't like bringin ' it , " Dan Masters cried , " but I saw what I saw with my own eyes . The sheriff swore in Biff Thomas as deputy then and there , so 's to git Harry to jail safe and sound . Then he sez come and git Tom quick as blazes ' cause Lexington folks are mighty riled up . " Grandpa wheeled his chair toward Dan Masters . " Lexingtonfolks git riled up mighty fast . They 'd better take care . " " Harry 's a good nigger ! " Ma cried . " Do you think Tom wouldlet him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good nigger ? " " Amelia ! " Pa cried . " Sheriff knows that , Amelia Dorr . That 's why he swore in a deputy . He did n't mean a good black to git hurt if he wuz a good black . " Ma 's hands spread out on the table . She knew that Nance had come up behind her and was holding the back of the chair with her hands . She spoke for Nance and herself . " Harry 's done  --  what ? " Pa and Dan Masters glanced at each other with lowered lids . Pa pressed for the last time on the table and then put his hands in his pockets . He answered quickly and turned toward the door . " Rape . " Blood filled Ma 's face . She struck the table with her hand . Her voice was low and angry . " I do n't believe it ! " Dan Masters found his tongue . " The girl pointed him out when he come to Lexington today . " Ma rose slowly . " What girl ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rickard , down Nuttree-way . " P302Her voice was a whip-lash . " She 's white trash ! " " Git Jess Newton , " Pa shouted at Dolly . " Git ... " " Rickards are kin to Newton , " Dan Masters said urgently . Pa gave him an angry look . " Git your coat ! " he said to Simon . He did not look again at Ma or Grandpa or Savanna , but strode into the hall . The people around the table had not stirred . Savanna took Ma 's hard , rigid hand . After awhile they heard four horses turn into the road and start in the direction of Lexington . Simon never remembered so dark a night . He was unaware of the stars . Newton and Pa and Dan Masters galloped unevenly , silence weighing them clown . Simon put his hand on his horse 's warm neck to steady a deep agitation within himself by contact with something alive . Pa did not speak to anyone . Into the darkness he said without raising his voice , " God damn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him as his body rose and fell to the horse . The countryside seemed to be holding its breath . Darkness oppressed the hills . House lamps were dim . Shacks had their doors and shutters closed and crouched in the darkness watching the horsemen ride past . Trees asked questions , and not even the earth answered them . Clouds rode over the stars . The spirit grew dark . Simon listened to the beat of the horses on the road . No sound in all the wide world but the sound of horses galloping on a road . Atlanta , Charleston , Washington had shining lights , but the sound of galloping horses would dim them , for the horses galloped within a wide pattern . He felt his skin tingle and the hair of his flesh rise . Beyond himself , he sensed how men in the dark countryside felt when they remembered Nat Turner or Denmark Vesey , or Joes , Harrys , or Bens who rose in the night and fell on their masters . He said these things to himself in intuitions , not words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the others . Turning a little in the saddle Dan said loudly over the sound of the hoofs : " ' Tai n't Tom 's Harry they 're so riled about but that white sonofabitch . " Excitementwas in his voice .

Harry do n't fool around with women less they 're niggers or whores ! "   " I 'm talkin ' what I mean . I 'm talkin ' about Smith  --  Cal Smith . Where they found Harry like I told you ! " " God damn it ! What 's Cal Smith got to do with it ? " " Like I told you ! " Masters cried , leaning one hand on the rump of his horse in order to turn his body .

They watched him , his body stiff and jerking , ride around the bend of the road , and they heard the sound of his horse when he was out of sight . After a moment , Simon said , " I never heard tell of Cal Smith . " Before Masters could speak , Newton said with an angry twist to his voice , " Some folks ai n't white folks a-tall . Cal Smith ai n't no ways a white man though he 's got a white skin . " " Cal 's a tinker , " Masters said . " Goes around in a cart . Always been quare . Folks never could make him out . But I did n't reckon on something like this . By God , they near tore him to pieces . " Newton 's slow singsong had become shrill . " I cud a-told you he was a nigger lover . I seen him a-talkin ' out by the barn to our blacks , and I gave him plumb hell . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dan Masters ? " " Cai n't say . Sheriff grabbed it faster'n he did Cal . " Simon rode in silence for a moment . " What do you think about it , Dan Masters ? " " I 'd lose money quicker on Smith than on Harry . " " You owe Smith the benefit of doubting . " They came around the bend of the road . They saw Dorr ahead , his horse walking . " Listen , " Masters said urgently . " White men do n't shake hands with niggers . I 'd lose money on Smith . " Simon said nothing . Dorr was evidently waiting for them to reach him , though he gave them no sign . He did not turn his head when their horses came abreast of his , but he said , staring straight ahead of him , " I 've got fifteen hundred dollars invested in Harry , and ' sides that he 's a good boy . Just remember that if there 's any trouble . " Dan Masters nodded , his eyes swift and darting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his words were slurred , " You called a white woman a whore . Reckon Lexington 'll say they ai n't P304no white women whores . Reckon it wo n't do to have white women called whores no matter what she a-done . Ai n't no nigger . . . " His breath failed him . He slapped his horse . Dorr answered without turning his head . " Your Cousin Milly 's a good girl , ai n't she , Jess ? I just hope she acts like one . " They came near to Lexington . On the dark road they passed dark forms . " They 've heard-tell , " Masters said with satisfaction . They came onto the rutted road of the town , past the houses where lights shone here and there . They came toward Courthouse Square , and into the lights of pine torches thrust into the ground . They came into the belt of human beings whose faces all looked alike in the uncertain light . Tom Dorr was recognized . Men squatting , men leaning against the courthouse , men sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and came alive . Dan Masters swung off his horse . " Keep back , boys . Give him a chance to git down ! " but they came on the run and swarmed about the horse shouting so that he could not hear their words . Simon , caught in the onrush , quieted his horse and looked at the faces in the flaring lights . An odd ecstasy seemed to possess them . The boredomof days and nights was broken . The rising and the setting of the sun had been hoodwinked . Simon 's horse moved restlessly . He watched Tom Dorr and admiredhim . He looked like his Pa . He was talking loudly and easily , reassuring , saying he was here to see law and justice done . " Now what you done with my boy ? You jest lead me to him and I 'll tar the daylights out of him if he do n't tell me the gospel truth  --  the straight , plain gospel truth without fancy trimmings . Now you jest let me down and you tell me . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the front took up the refrain as it came from behind him and tried to translate it , but there was no one voice strong enough to bear the full burden . Tom Dorr shook his head and danced his horse a little to clear a space in which to dismount . " I reckon maybe there 's a mistake , or then , maybe there ai n't , " he said . " No nigger 's goin ' to get away with anything after we 're sure . " A voice shrilled from the crowd . " We 're sure , Tom , God damn sure ! " Another close to him said , " She pointed him out her own self . " Three , four , five , shouted , with excitement cracking their voices , " We seen her do it . We seen her point him out ... We P305seen him take from Smith . . . We seen Cal Smith . . . We seen . . . We seen .. . Dorr was on his feet , the reins in his hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his horse close to Dorr in order that the crowd could not sweep in on Tom from both sides . " All right , boys . That 's gospel truth then . But we got to hold on to law and order . " " We aim on that . We count on that ! Eh , boys ? " Dan Masters called from his horse . The crowd 's words were unintelligible now . The crowd moved slowly toward the courthouse , some walking backward unable to turn , others running ahead up the steps of the courthouse . The groan and rumble of words spread beyond in the darkness where there were no lamps or torches . Tom Dorr kept on advancing , leadinghis horse , talking steadily , reaching as many as he could withoutraising his voice . Simon walked close beside him , thinking By God , here 's the way to handle a mob . Lord , keep my memory green . " I certainly thank you boys for keeping things legal ... Harry 's always been a good boy , but you cai n't ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch that lady , is n't that right ? . . . Do n't seem possible but you cai n't ever tell . " The crowd continued to move in the direction he set , ready to keep moving till daylight , ready to keep moving till next week , ready to keep moving forever and ever , so long as they were not moving away from the core and the heart of excitement . Cries went up when the stout , short , little sheriff appeared in the doorway with a lamp in his hand . " Tom says he 's goin ' t ' lick the tar . . . Tom says that nigger clone tell him already . . . " The sheriff lifted a stentorian voice . " All right , fellers , open up there ! Open up ! Give Tom Dorr room . Git back there . Open up . Here you , boy , hitch up them horses . Open up . You git in here quick , Tom Dorr ! " With one thumb hitched into the top of his trousers , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bearing the light with him . Tom looked swiftly at Simon and spoke with his lips barely moving . " Stick close . Do n't forgit a thing you hear or see . " The crowd poured in through the open door , Dan Masters and Newton struggled up to the front , and walked backwards facing the crowd in order to preserve a free corridor for Tom Dorr . TheP306sheriff said nothing more . He preceded them rapidly and , unlocking a door , stood aside to let Tom Dorr and Simon go in . He did not close the door , but he stood in the doorway , and the crowd stood behind him on tiptoe , craning to watch and listen . Harry rose slowly from the box on which he was sitting . His yellow face was stretched with fear . All gaiety had gone from his mouth . His eyes were wide and unblinking . He steadied himself with his hand against the barred window and his mouth opened but he did not speak . Tom stood looking at him for a moment , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Harry  --  you black bastard . " Harry wavered for a moment , then his voice rose on a high wild stream of words . " God Almighty , Mr. Tom , I did n't do nothin ' . ' Fore Lord Jesus , I did n't do nothin ' like they say . They done ketch me and say , You done this  --  say you did n't , you black sonofabitch !  --  you done that , you bastard , ' and I did n't do nothin ' ' cept business like you give me leave . " Dorr 's voice was as strained as Harry 's . " A white lady pointed her finger at you . Wonder they did n't take you right out and string you up . " " Mr. Tom , I never did see that white lady before . " " That 's a God damn lie , Harry ! " Tom roared . " You know Milly Rickard well as you know Jess Newton . " " Not that way , Mr. Tom . Lord Jesus , I would n't lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his immovable position by the door , " Reckon she knew what she was talkin ' about . " A voice from the corridor cried shrilly , " White women ai n't safe no more . Ai n't never been so before ! " Harry 's voice sank to a whisper . " I ai n't touchin ' white trash , Mr. Torn . ' Fore God and ' fore Jesus I ai n't . " The sheriff heard him and turned in the doorway . " There now , boys , there now . Clear the corridor . Clear the corridor . " His action was quicker than the end of Harry 's words . " Keep movin ' , boys . You know me . We 'll git to the bottom of this . But we 're goin ' have law and order . " Dorr drew his lower lip over his upper and stared at Harry . Harry leaned against the wall , his tall slim body bent a little , his eyes wide and staring at Dorr . Dorr said in a low voice , " WhatP307kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's what you can tell me , by God . " " Mr. Tom , it was all right stuff ! Swear by Jesus it was all right stuff . " Don ' turned swiftly to the sheriff who had the door half closed , with his body filling the opening . " Where 's the Yankee stuff Smith give to Harry ? " The sheriff plunged his hand into his wide coat pocket and silentlyhanded over a sheet of rough paper . Simon moved closer to look over Dorr 's shoulder . He read it quickly , giving no sign of surprise . He waited until Dorr had read slowly , and then he glanced at Dorr 's face . Dorr stared at Harry for a moment . A genuine and unmistakable bewilderment was in his voice when he spoke . " This here is nothing but Scripture . " Harry 's voice was high pitched . " Right stuff ! That 's what I 'm tellin ' you , Mr. Tom ! " Dorr looked again at the paper . Simon stepped back against the wall , and put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whiteness around Dorr 's eyes . His hands shook ever so slightly . " Right stuff . . . ! " he said and read aloud slowly and flatly : " ' The spirit of the Lord is upon me , because he anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor ; he had sent me to heal the brokenhearted , to preach deliverance to the captive and recovery of sight to the blind , to set at liberty them that are bruised . ' Luke 4:18 . ' And I will bring back the captivity of my people Israel , and they shall plant vineyards and drink the wine thereof ; they shall also make gardens and eat the fruit of them . And I will plant them upon their own land . ' Amos 9:15 .

' I Cor. 1:28. " 1 ! P308Dorr did not look up when he finished reading . He folded the paper slowly and put it into his pocket . He turned to the sheriff . " Where 's Smith ? " The sheriff held out his hand . " That 's evidence . " Then he jerked his head , and turned back with his old refrain to the men in the corridor : " Keep movin ' , fellers . Clear the corridor . Step lively . Keep movin ' . " Dorr did not look again at Harry , but Simon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wall , and his foot was feeling for the box on which he had been sitting . Simon smiled at him faintly , but Harry was not looking at him ; his eyes were still on Dorr . Tom 's shoulders were hunched , he looked straight ahead , his feet set the pace beyond which no one hurried . The crowd was murmuring . The murmuring deepened . Simon felt a terrible excitementcommunicate itself to him , an excitement far more intense than he had felt before Harry 's jail door , an excitement which he did not need to analyze for it was a part of his blood . They stood before the cell door . Simon took the lamp from the sheriff . The sheriff fitted in the key . Murmurs came involuntarily , out of blood-remembrances of antagonisms and fears . Do you know Cal Smith ? I know Cal Smith . I knowed Cal Smith since . . . since ... He come from thataway , walkin ' down that road one day eighteen-twenty years ago , walkin ' all the way from North Ca'lina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , talked with ' em , ate with ' em . Seemed like me and you .. . The door was opened . Tom Dorr and Simon passed through . The crowd converged into the narrow doorway . The shuffle and movement of feet sounded down the long hall . The breathing of men became an uneasy thing , short , harsh , communicative , speaking a language older than words . Simon held the lamp high . The light spread dimly into the cornersof the room . Simon did not see Cal Smith at first , for he lay motionless on a pallet and made no effort to move . Simon lowered the lamp and the light flowed down his lean body . Then Simon realized that pale eyes were watching him steadily . They looked at each other  --  the three , and the sheriff standing silent in the doorway . ( Behind , in the hall , a voice called , " H'ist me up , fellers . Hell-and-burn , he do n't look no diff'rent ! " ) Tom Dorr stood within the pool of light , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Simon held the lamp shaded with one hand and listened with a dark remembrance to the crowd noises in the hall . Tom Dorr stood thus , and after a moment Cal Smith raised himself to his elbow . He was a small man ; his face was thin . A paleness lay about his eyes and nose , but his eyes were not humble . His arm trembled a little but he did not shift his position . In the farther reaches of the crowd , a man shouted , " What 's happening in there ? " And another answered , " They just a-lookin ' at each other , just a-starin ' . " Simon looked down at the lamp . In this way he did not need to see the pale , steady eyes of Cal Smith and the hunched shoulders of Tom . In the corridor , the crowd moved with a growing uneasiness . The lamp light burned into Simon 's eyes . He turned for reliefto the sheriff and saw him standing by the door , squat and short , his legs outspread , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cal Smith was a little man , and his supporting arm shook . His wispy , reddish hair fell over his ears . There was a plaintive hollowness beneath his eyes . Simon found himself staring . There was nothing humble in those hollow eyes , no pleading .. . Simon could not stop his staring . . . no pleading , only the faintestcast of fear . . . And the whole Southland ranged up against him ! Simon could not endure his own quietness . He moved , clattering a chair . The crowd surged restlessly . For a moment , Cal Smith 's eyes went from Dorr to the sheriff . It was a flashing journey , almostimperceptible . Simon saw his lips move . His voice was small . It said , " Tom Dorr ... . Then Dorr moved . Swiftly , his shoulders still hunched , his hands still doubled in his pockets , he went past the sheriff out of the door . Simon had no choice . He followed . The sheriff shut the door . Dorr stood before the crowd , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palpable . They stared at him but did not speak . The sheriff stood beside him . He said , " Well , Tom , reckon .. . Dorr did not hear him . He turned to the door and shook it to make sure it was locked . He stood for a moment with his head lowered and then shook the door again . His face was a stone . Finally his hunched shoulders led the way through the crowd . They stood on the steps of the courthouse , and the flaring torchlightcaught at their faces . Dorr snapped his fingers at the coloredP310boy who squatted by the horses . When he swung himself onto his horse , Simon and Newton followed him . He sat on his restless horse for a moment , looking at the reins . Abruptly he spoke to the sheriff . " How soon kin we git indictments ? " " Not ' fore September court , " the sheriff answered . Dorr slapped the reins ; the light of the torches shone fiercely on his face for a moment . He started down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in silence , past the lighted houses , out of the village Simon looked once at Newton . Newton 's face was closed , the ugly hard ridge of lower lip was unsoftened . Tom Dorr slowed his horse , but he ( lid not look back . Simon rode up beside him . For a moment , Dorr said nothing . Then , without a side look , he said , " You 'll take ' em both . " Simon did not understand . " You 'll be the lawyer-feller for them both . " Simon was startled . His ( lark brows drew in a straight line across his nose . " I ca n't do that . " Dory 's hunched body rose and fell to the trot of the horse . He did not look at Simon . " You got no choice . " " Pa Dorr , listen . I do n't belong in this county . The jury would n't care for me . I 'd get a bad judgment . Besides that , I 've got a campaigncoming on in the mountains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then he said , " There ai n't a lawyer in five counties would defend Cal Smith . " Simon felt a sudden coldness . His hands lay lax on the reins . He did not want the world which Pa Dorr was handing him . He did not want to have to fight , exposed to five counties . " Willie Johnson 'd be tickled to death if I 'd give him Harry 's case , but why should I ? It 's fitten my son-in-law have it . " " But Cal Smith does n't belong to you . Why Cal Smith ? " " I knowcd hint twenty years . The sonofabitch ought to have a fair trial no matter what he 's done . A man 's Negro 'll get a fair trial because he 's worth something , but Cal Smith ai n't worth a bent nickel . For Harry 's sake I 've got to stick to him . " Simon 's voice was thin and flat . " You think he 's guilty ? " There was a note of surprise in Dory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him with my own eyes talkin ' to blacks on the road ? " P311SAVANNA SAID NOTHING WHEN HE TOLD HER . SHE ASKED ONE OR TWOquestions about Mrs. Smith which he was unable to answer . She sat for a few minutes , saying nothing , which he knew passionately was not like her , then went off to say good-night to Grandpa . He would have liked to say good-night to Grandpa for the same reason that she did , but he knew that the decision and the issues must be settled without the blinding persuasiveness of Grandpa . Yet he cursed and knocked his fist against a chair . . . Cursed Grandpa and looked with angry eyes at Savanna when she came back to undressfor bed . . . sat on the edge of the bed even when the light was out and stared into the darkness . He rode back the next day without a word , having listened silentlyto Tom Dorr 's instructions , having mounted his horse without a backward look , bearing the hard core within him . That men could be in jail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was angry at them for being victims of nonsense and angry at those who held them for being servants of nonsense . In Lexington , few knew him . He could ride to the courthouse and hitch his horse without drawing any of the crowd-mind and body of the night before . He went to the sheriff and told him what Tom Dorr wanted . The sheriff stared and nodded and silently offereda ' baccy chew . " How come you take on that Cal Smith ? " he asked after a moment . " You cai n't git nothin ' for him but guilty . Do n't seem worth the effort . " Simon jingled some coins in his pocket , anxious to be on his way . " Might get another . The evidence is all Scripture . It 's goin ' to be bad for a hard-shell Baptist or Methodist jury to go against Scriptures . " The sheriff looked at him for a long moment , then he moved his head and spat a stream of tobacco juice . " I 'll tell you right now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coins again and crossed one leg over the other . " Reckon that 's my job  --  to prove that it is . " The sheriff 's eyelids were still immobile . Only the end of his redveinednose twitched slightly . " Oglethorpe County folks think a heap of yore Pa-in-law , but I reckon he do n't hold with them views . " Simon looked down at the foot which was tracing spirals on the dusty floor and smiled a little . " Reckon he ca n't afford to hold with some Christian doctrines any more than you and me . " The sheriff stopped his chewing for a moment and narrowed his eyes . Then he resumed his chewing without a word . " How about bail ? " Simon asked . " Got a thousand dollars ? " Simon shook his head . The sheriff was silent . " Can I see my clients now ? " " Dead set , ai n't you ? " " You would n't want a Georgian to be scared of anything , now would you ? " The sheriff did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his keys . Three hours later , Simon leaned against the worm fence to talk to Pa . He had things to remember . . . Harry 's voice saying , " Prove I did n't touch her ? You cai n't make me a white man , can you , Mr. Si ? " Cal Smith , with eyes lowered , " Some folks in Lexingtonhas got a name fer folks who air too poor to own a plot of earth . They 've called me by that name , and it 's got a lonesome sound . It gits you to talkin ' to black fellers jest fer a body t ' talk t ' . " Simon said to Pa , as he pulled at the bark of the fence , " They 've got no evidence , except Scripture , and Scripture talks for us . By God , I 'll preach Scripture till a new revival busts on the country . Cal Smith 'll have a real good fightin ' chance . . . " I do n't give a good God damn ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I 've got things on my mind  --  on my mind . " He struck his forehead with his knuckles and groaned like a man with twisted vitals . Simon stirred against the fence . Pa struck his foreheadagain , and struck the fence , and cursed softly and monotonously . Simon did not watch him , keeping his gaze across the fields . Pa pounded on the fence and his words became groans . " What for , " he said , " why to a man like me ? Who was goin ' P313burn off that new land ? Harry ! Who plows the best goddamn furrow ? Harry ! Who 's plagued and riled with his guts emptying out ? Me ! Me ! Did I sit me down and git up again and say , ' I create slavery ? ' Did I ? " He expected no answer . The deep clefts in his face were filled with despair ; angry tears filmed his eyes . He struck at the fence again and again . " I did n't invent a thing like slavery  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuck with it , ai n't I ? " He turned fiercely . " Ai n't I ? " But he did not wait for a reply . " I 've got my whole life in slavery . I 'm a slave , ai n't I ? I ca n't get rid of ' em , and I 'm ruined if I keep ' em . Ben 's gone and Caroline 's gone , and Harry 'll hang . I 've got nigger slaves around my neck , and they do n't care whether me and mine live or die . " He shook the fence violently , and Simon continued to look across the fields , not willing that Tom Dorr should see himself naked in another man 's eyes . " I 'm not a mean man . Christ my savior knows I 'm not a mean man . I would n't drive anyone more'n I 'm driv . But they do n't care what happens to me  --  they 'd lick off as fast as I 'd turn my back . Harry did n't touch that girl  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doin ' talkin ' to Cal Smith ? That 's the thing you ca n't answer . But I can . Not a black sonofabitch cares  --  not one of ' em cares . " He leaned his arm against the fence and dug his knuckles against his eyes . His breath was whistles of sound . " There 's no place . There 's no place to go . " He opened his hand and emptied it of a heap of earth . " Plow deep and find life in this tired land ? There ai n't no life anywhere . " His dirt-engrained hand pulled his hat down over his eyes . Simon had dinner and then he mounted his horse again . Tom Dorr stood watching him from the yard . " Reckon I 'll go with you  --  wherever it is , " he said without stirring . " Seems like I ca n't stand being here . " " I 'm going to sec the Rickard girl , " Simon answered . " I would n't call that a real cheerin ' trip . " Dorr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flinging the saddle on and buckling it hastily . " That 's doing something , " he said , " that 's not just thinkin ' . " The ghost of animation lighted his face . It gave the momentary look of health to his sickly paleness . He came along quickly after Simon , kicking the horse 's sides .   " You reckon you 've got something to say to her that 'll sound good in court ? " " Do you think anything 'd sound good in court but a straight No . ' Can you make her say that ? " Tom Dorr trotted his horse in silence , the creases of his weatheredface speaking a language older than words . " You kin talk rough to her , " he said after a while . " The Rickardsare more no-count than a no-count nigger . If you talk rough maybe you 'll skeer ' em right . " Tom Dorr took the lead down unfamiliar roads between plowed fields , and fields where last year 's cotton plants still lay on the ground . They went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A sow brooded her litter in the middle of the road and did not move when they passed her . The house was a lean-to with a pole stuck into the earth to prop up its sagging roof . The family appeared in the door at the sound of the horses and stood silently with no expression although visitors were , in the nature of things , rare . Tom Dorr called " Howdy " and swung off his horse . Simon sat quietly , trying with his heart and his eyes to reach a common equation . They looked at him more than at Tom . He felt a misery and wonder . Tom Dorr was speaking loudly to the lean-necked , scraggy man as if he were deaf or unfamiliar with English . " Lex Rickard , this yere 's my son-in-law . He 's got some questions to ask yer family that I 'd thank you kindly to answer . " All the eyes in the doorway shifted with a single , slow movement to Simon . Simon swung off his horse . " Can I come in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made no movement . Simon stood looking at them , smiling with his eyes . Tom said harshly , " Leave him come in . He 's not fixin ' to hurt you . " Lex Rickard moved then into the shack , and Simon squeezed past the two girls and the boy in the doorway . A woman lay on a dirty quilt on the floor and by the cold fireplace a small , pot-bellied boy squatted with only a shirt to cover him down to the middle . The shack was a single room with no windows . A bedstead stood at the far end and a spinning wheel stood by the door with the treadle broken . A packing case served as a bureau and table ; rough boards nailed together with deerskin scats formed a pair of chairs . An out-of-date calendar , advertising patent medicines , hung by the bed . Simon said , " Howdy , ma'am , " to the woman and took a seat in a P315chair . The grown boy swiveled around on his heel so that he could take the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lex came to squat on the floor by the door . Simon looked curiously at the girls . The older one passed him and sat on the edge of the bed . Tom Dorr spoke roughly . " We 've been studyin ' real hard to find out the fact of things . Seems like Milly over yonder has had a heap to say about my boy Harry . Whyfor ? " Lex 's whiskered chin rested against his knees . His pale , rheumy eyes were fixed on the dirty floor , a mite this side of the pallet where his wife lay . Tom waited for a few minutes . Till Rickard on the pallet , Milly Rickard on the bed , the littlest girl who held the pot-bellied baby against her hip , Art Rickard who stood by the door , all watched them . It was a deathlike watching , something that human beings had no share in . " Give me an answer , " Tom said harshly . Simon chilled in the silence . He fastened on things that were comprehensible . The dirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the gray of his skin like the underbark of a tree . He tried his own voice in the stillness . " Reckon everybody 's had a different thing to say . Seemed proper to get the straight of it , Lcx Rickard , for your daughter 's sake , and good all around . " On the pallet , Till Rickard raised herself to her elbow , the dead eyes relentless . Simon sat very still , only shifting his gaze from Lcx to Till . Her huge disproportionate hand rested against her lank , gray hair . Simon sensed an omniverous and passionate curiosity which her gray , snuff-stained , expressionless face concealed like a mask . He felt something sicken inside him . The young ones had the death as well , the little girl and the pot-bellied baby . The little girl showed no weariness though the sweat stood on her face . All things were lost in the immense vacuum of staring , all hunger , all pain , all blood-stirrings , all muscular action , all reality , all deep or surface truth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for survivalthrough staring , through sensing one thing outside yourself . He looked at Milly cautiously . Her shoulders drooped , her hands hung between her knees , her matted , yellow hair was tied back from her face by a string . She returned his look with a wiliness that was subtle , swift , and finished , and then her lips opened slightly , and she stared with no look in her face . P316Tom Dorr was stirring restlessly . He struck his hand against his knee . " Do n't do no good studyin ' what not to say . Reckon you know , Lex Rickard , that folks do n't talk so good of you and your'n . A mite of truth would go a long way to make folks talk different . " Simon wondered , his eyes were cast down . These people were not like Jeb Larkin who somehow did not die . These people were dead , dead a long time , and nobody had had the Christian decency to bury them . He wondered suddenly at Tom Dorr , sitting there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were long dead . But he waited , caught in the gray death . Tom Dorr stood up suddenly . " I 've got a fine mess of parsnips and one-two bushel of ' taters up to my place I could spare , if there was a tongue goin ' t ' wag in the right way . " Slow as the rising of mist , Lex 's eyes lifted from his study of the floor and squinted , pale and narrow , at Tom Dorr . " ' Taters , " he said finally , with no inflection in his voice . On the pallet , Till Rickard stirred and sighed , lying down again , her eyes fixed on the ceiling . " Some folks think Milly 's scared of something that does n't have a mite to do with Harry , " Simon said . " You reckon that 's so ? " He glanced again at Milly whose pale eyes were wily-wise , staring at him without shame , eyes so pale that his glance seemed to pass through them without contact . Lex 's arms were trembling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than hog-meat . " Till spoke from the floor , her eyes still turned to the ceiling . " Ruther hev snuff than hog-meat . " " It 'll be snuff and ' taters if you talk right about Harry . " Tom Dorr stood in the doorway  --  looking at none of them  --  looking toward the road . From the bed , Milly gave a strange , little laugh , like a bleat , but no one took notice . Lex 's arms were still trembling like a man with the fever but it seemed almost as if he had forgotten the words that had been said . His blurred eyes were studying space , his whiskered lips said something they could not hear . Milly laughed again , and skittled across the floor , kicking her Pa as she passed him , and ran on into the yard . Tom Dorr spoke to Simon with a jerked head . Simon got up and went past him . Tom Dorr said , back over his shoulder , " I got a side o ' hog-meat I could give you the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first , hog-meat after . An ' a package of snuff . " They did not tarry . They heard Till 's voice in a shrill cry , " I P317cud most die for a whifter . Most die ! " Simon swung on his horse , and eased her into the rutted road , where they went once again around the sow . They saw Milly standing by a hackberry bush , pretending to be hidden , but exploding into her high wild bleat when a hurled stone tore up the dust before Simon 's horse . Simon looked around to see Art Rickard stooping to pick up another . After supper that night , Simon set down a candle in order to write to Waller in Milledgeville and Adam Hawks up in Ellijay . Ic meant to lay out before them his perplexities , his exposed position , his doubts . Of Waller he could ask intelligible advice , but of Adam Hawks it was more difficult , for Simon knew that he should be home in the mountains now , riding down pinch-gut trails , telling his deepest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once and rubbed his hand across his eyes , seeing Adam Hawks with his rusty black pants caught under his shoes , riding his old horse down the Cartecay road to pass a word with Jobenny Hyde , two men considering in silence the young fellerdown in the plantation lands who had such a load on his mind , wondering if he were a fit feller ; maybe they ought to choose them another who did not have a pa-in-law with black slaves . He studied out words , but could find no ease in his mind . Everywherewere uncharted , dark roads . Old Lawyer Rankin had given him leave to search in his law hooks for Georgia court cases that would give him guidance and hope . It was harder than a sinner 's path , this way to perdition . At Bonaventura , there was a slowness in the movements of the plantation folks , not the slowness which came from laziness , but the slowness which came from too much wondering and thinking . He understood this . He understood everything , he figured . He could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting on the courthouse steps at Lexington were thinking , what fellerssitting on the gallery rail at Randy Owen 's store were thinking , what the judge and the sheriff and the black boy who cleaned up the tobacco juice in the court-room were thinking . It did not give case to his mind . The air was heavy . No one talked of the heaviness . They talked around it and over it , allowing small things to pose as big things , making clear in the shrillness of a voice or a sudden silence , in a rough step or a suddenly stilled one , the shame and the confusion . P318Yet Jupe and Fred knew what they knew when Jess Newton himselfseized the plow and drove its share violently into the earth , groaning with anger . Nance and Eva knew when they stood in the kitchen door in the dark night and heard Ma 's voice above them , lifted in sudden , wild weeping . Tom Dorr knew when he came and said to Simon , " Them ' taters are gone . Reckon those bastards , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep us from knowin ' one thing for sure . " Savanna knew when she came out into the back lot and watched the last glow of daylight leave the sky . Her childhood . . . and yet she trembled . She knew the shape of these soft hills as well as she knew the shape of Simon 's face ; in the dark she could see with her memory the maple grove in the valley and the line of elms by the road . Yet she trembled , and went into the house hastily , testing the door as she closed it to make sure it was tight , standing in the dark parlor with her hands over her mouth , afraid to light a candle , afraid to think of any she loved out alone in Oglethorpe darkness . It was a fear such as she had never known before . Evvie Masters came to borrow knitting needles and to consider them with bright and shameless eyes . She stood in the kitchen swinging her basket and staring candidly . " All seems mighty silly . Ma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Pa boltin ' the door at night and cussin ' out Ma 's screechin ' . Do n't seem as though anything could be as bad as that . " Amelia Dorr laid down her cake spoon and shrieked suddenly . " Do n't you ever say those things , Evvie Masters ! We 've got nothing to be afraid of  --  nothin ' , nothin ' ! " Evvie looked at her with cold appraisal and said , " Reckon you ought to hear county folks , ma'am . They do n't think quite that-away . " " Not quite thataway , " Simon said later on to Savanna and herPa . " Fact is , I 'd like to have Cal Smith and Harry tried in most any ' f county but Oglethorpe . " Pa said , " Folks have a respect for the law here , and the Dorts have a good name . Bank on that . " " Down in Lexington , " Simon answered , " there 's murder in their eyes . " They 're skeered plumb to death , " Tom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . " P319That night , Pa looked up from his Scripture reading , and listened to a round of shooting . The shooting died away , and he resumedhis reading . He measured the words carefully , like a woman mixing bread . " But Mary heard all these things and pondered them iii her heart . And the shepherds returned , glorifying God . " The shooting was heard again . Pa laid aside his Bible and went to the window . Simon stood beside him . Grandpa watched them from under his shaggy brows . In the hall , a door creaked as if a slave had come across from the kitchen in search of comfort . They could not see into the dark night ; they could only hear the hard-ridden horses pounding down the road between the elm trees , and hear the shouts of men calling back and forth . Ma suddenlybegan to cry . " Have n't we got enough trouble without that patrol banging clown roads , makin ' trouble ! " Pa did not answer . He stood by the window for awhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abruptly , and stood with his hands deep in his homespun trousers . He said slowly and quietly , " Goddamn it . . . sons of fornication . . . Goddamn their liverlights. . . scarin ' the county , hangin ' my Harry ' cause they do n't know ease from trouble . . . His eyes were drawn to Grandpa . He continued to look at Grandpa for some time . Court was called for the first Monday in September . Savanna wanted to go , to ride in the buggy , and sit outside the courthouse . She 'd take Mammy with her , she 'd be . . . Simon said No . After awhile he leaned over and kissed her , and rode off with Tom Dorr . They rode silently down the road in the clear morning , scaring jack-rabbits and bringing children 's faces to the windows of houses . As they came into Lexington , Dorr spoke suddenly in his thin , gruff voice , " I see this thing now as not easy for you , Simon . I 'll say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We 'll fight , " he said . " Reckon they 'll light too . " " Reckon , " Tom Dorr said . Court week  --  all over the world , Simon figured , as they left their horses at the blacksmith 's and went , pushing their way , to the courthouse . The poor men 's way of having a good time , poor men thrust hack here out of sight and sound of the world . The peddlers had P320come , the itinerants with their carts ; the wagons and buggies of county folk were hitched under the autumn trees ; over on Randy Owen 's store-stoop you could n't budge for the women in bonnets , with baskets ; the men chewing , showing off their Sunday waistcoats , wearing stiff , staring ties , talking , talking , talking , spitting , speculating , betting , putting words in the judge 's mouth , watching Tom Dorr and Simon , watching , saying Howdy or falling silent as they passed . Tom Dorr went first through the crowd toward the courthouse steps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his broad hat shielding his eyes . Folks made an aisle for them up the courthouse steps . Fellows in rough homespun pushed fellows in shabby homespunand made room for them to pass . Simon followed Dorr 's lean , stooped figure , realizing that Tom Dorr was a big man in the county . Simon looked swiftly at the faces which turned to watch Tom Dorr . Knowed him always . . . rides in and out of Lexington on a horse when mean fellers ride mules , make a speech election day for the Democratic candidates , and men mind what he says , stands drinks for fellers at Joby Milligan 's , talks county interests , craps and cotton ; and cotton and slaves . . . niggers . . . owns twelve slaves his own self . H'ist a feller up by gittin a black boy . Black wenchin ' for fun and black slavery for makin ' gentry . Who does n't want to be gentry and well spoken to ? Who does n't want to take it easy and set down for a change ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth and stumpy cotton , and set down aside your wife and fan yourselves on hot days ? . . . Unless you 're the fellers with narrowin ' eyes that has got too far to clum up ever to reach Mr. Dorr  --  the fellers who are pushed back by other fellers ' elbows to make room for Mister Tom Dorr who 's got stinkin ' black boys to work fer him. , ' cause he knows white fellers is white fellers and would n't lift a piny knot to work fer another white man . ( A feller got a cut under his eye from another feller who pushed him too hard while making room for Mister Tom Dorr . They did not exchange words because fists were all they needed . ) Simon and Tom Dorr went into the court-room , and people stared and called out and spat with excitement . Outside , the sheriff could be heard calling out that court was goin ' convene , court was goin ' convene . Already the air in the court-room needed freshening . Stale clothes P321and bodies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No inch of space was untenanted . Men sat on the floor around the walls , and squirmed on the rough splintering floor , leavingcrescent marks on the whitewashed walls where their heads moved back and forth . The judge came in  --  Mordecai Fletcher from over near Wilkes County . He was not their own . He kept order like a stranger , bangingin the way a man from Lexington would not have dared . He was a grim man , Simon thought , who looked as if he were , time and again , made angry by the law . He banged now so that everyonesat up and took notice . Cal Smith and Harry were coming in through a side door . The sheriff and a deputy had guns showing . Simon raised his eyes swiftly as Cal Smith passed him . He was a tired , little man . Maybe his wispy hair had been combed , but it hung over his ears sad and wan , and his coat was in need of a brushing . He stumbled , passing around to the prisoners ' bench @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if full of weakness and sadness at being here . Harry moved slowly , his back very straight . Simon caught a glimpse of his face , hard-jawed , dull-eyed . Simon looked down again at his crossed boots , wondering and waiting . The judge banged . " Do the prisoners have counsel ? " Simon lifted his head at Mead , the county-attorney , a little man with steel spectacles , a pot belly and a worrisome manner . Simon uncrossed his legs and stood up slowly . Counsel for both prisoners " willing and waiting to serve . " The Grand Jury had been sworn in and was waiting . They were all men whom Tom Dorr could nod to and say " Howdy " outside of court . Mead called his first witness to testify in the county 's case against Harry , property of Thomas J. 1 ) orr of Oglethorpe County , charged with rape against a white lady . . . I done see her . . . She told me . . . Yes , sir . . . No , sir . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secondwitness : " He did n't say a thing . . . I saw . . . that 's a lie ... yes , sir . . . yes , sir .. . And a third witness and a fourth . Mr. Simon Bliss did not fool with them . He listened and took notes . Mead called his first witness against Calvin A. Smith of Oglethorpe County who , witness said , aided and abetted . . . Yes , sir , I seen with my own eyes . .. yes , sir . . . no ... reckon . . . sheriff say . . . Aye . . . aye . aye . P322Noon came . The Grand Jury went out to eat and exchange their opinions . Prisoners had guns put at their backsides and went off to have a bite of dinner . Simon talked to them once more briefly , thinking what they must be thinking , and letting them know that he understood . Then he ate dinner quickly with Tom Dorr at Joby Milligan 's . Afterwards he went back alone through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends . He knew that folks pointed at him ; he was too tall and conspicuous to escape notice . He smiled and sent back jokes , knowing how much he needed friends to shape public opinion . He figured on the Grand Jury spending an hour on its dinner , eating its fill and more , sampling Joby Milligan 's Augusta whisky , then settling down finally to say what it thought about Harry and Cal Smith .. . They came back more quickly than he had expected , showing that the jurymen were not divided in their minds . Old Fletcher banged and banged till the court-room was quiet , and the foreman could have his say . " . . . witnesses examined . . . unanimous opinion . . . prisoners being guilty it is ordered and charged . .. to be tried according to law . " Simon sighed and looked out over the heads of the spectators . The air was unbreathable now . Old man Robbins began nodding , and Dan Masters puffed out his lips and fanned himself with his hat . Indictments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the body of a white female ... " " Charged with subverting slave property . . . of conspiring and giving wrongful counsel .. . " " How plead the prisoners ? Guilty or not guilty ? Not guilty . . . not guilty . " Prosecution proposes to try Harry , property of Thomas J. Dorr , first . ( A man 's property has a value which the court recognizes over and above . . . ) Impaneling of jurors now , with the consent of the court . . . Simon sat in front of the prisoners ' bench . A loneliness hedged the three of them around like thorn bushes . His eyes were swift , missing nothing . No shadow on a face , no bewilderment , no perplexity , no confidence . Sitting here alone meant he had no ties with the folks who sat on the other benches . He was shed of all loyalties but the one he had set up for himself . He was hard and unappeas- P323lug . Oglethorpe was a mighty small little county , but he had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no time to lose . " John Gilder . . . you got any scruples against the death penalty ? . . . have you got a free and open mind . . . will you weigh the evidence without preconceived notion ... " Mead 's fidgety little voice hounded and nosed . " John Gilder . . . are you a slaveholder ? " . . . Simon was quick and impersonal , " Have you any scruples against a man holding slaves ? ( Oh , irony that was bigger than the tallest oak on Lonesome ! ) . . . would you give a black man fair and equal justice ? . " Robert Lake . . . you got any scruples against the death penalty ? . . . have you got a free and open mind ? . . . Jason Payne . . . Isaiah Baker . . . Andrew Murray . . . William Shelley . . . James Stillwell . . . " Lean men , short men , tall men , poor men , shabby men in homespun and patched breeches , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean-spoken , gentlemanly , needing a shave , water slicking hair , death penalty . . . I got no slaves , but that do n't mean . . . black sonsof bitches , I mean to say ... Take your place , Mr. Gilder . . . excused . . . take your place . . . Your Honor a full panel , and it 's late in the day . " The judge banged his gavel . " Court adjourned . " Tom Dorr and Simon rode back to Bonaventura . A muscle in Tom Dorr 's face jerked continuously and his voice was tight with excitement . He rode hard and quick , his shoulders hunched as usual , looking neither to right nor left , but talking without pause to Simon . " Reckon they 'll go easy on Harry . Seems like  --  talkin ' to folks  --  they wo n't dare do otherwise . Folks say Milly Rickard 's got to have a man no matter what . They do n't aim to see Harry hangin ' insteadof one of those other men . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Seems like that jury 's made up good . I 've known all them chaps for a long time . They 've thought hard . There 'll be no foolin ' around , sayin ' this is so when it ai n't . Folks are n't naturally mean , " he added after a pause . " Reckon there 's something about a man 's property that 's . most as valuable as his soul . That 's not sinful speakin ' , that 's just sense . A man 's soul gets all shriveled up if he 's not sure whether his cotton 's comin ' up , and who 's goin ' tend it . " P324Simon spoke through his thoughts which were finding their way through doubts and wonderment , like birds in a briar patch . " If Harry goes free , I reckon Cal Smith 'll go free . He and Harry ca n't be set apart if we mean to make us a strong case . " Tom Dorr rode in silence , high in his stirrups but hunched . After a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellers have been runnin ' away . It just wo n't do . Cal Smith 's got to get a good fair trial , but if you get him off scot-free he 'll be wearin ' a suit of tar and be rid away on a rail . Maybe something worse will happen . I would n't want to be the one to say . " Simon looked at him for a long moment , and started to speak , then remained silent . Savanna stood by the mare the next morning , running her hand softly up and down Simon 's leg . " It does n't set right , " she said , looking up into his face , " you one place and me another when bold things are happening . This is n't a lightsome thing you 're doing ; it 's set away deep and heavy in our hearts . " Simon ruffled her hair and held his hand against the round of her head . " Who 'll do your task , waiting here for our baby ? " She caught his hand in hers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . baby . . . oh , my sweetheart  --  Ma 's face gets whiter every day . She says words to me , about us , shaming words . There 's no way of thinking here for a baby like ours . I just sit and look off across those hills . . . " " The hills . . . " he said , smiling down at her . She tightened her lips and rubbed her cheek against his hand . " Be lovesome , " he said , " and waiting . Harry and Cal need it as much as I. " She kissed his hand and let it fall . He hesitated for a moment before he turned his horse . He looked at her long and deeply and then he touched his fingers to his lips . " Be waiting , " he said again . She stood away from the horse , her arms hanging at her side , a cloud in her eyes . Suddenly she crossed her arms over her distended body and smiled . " I do n't hold with women waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 've waited a heap too long . When you say good-by , do n't ask me to keep waiting . " He rode into town with Tom Dorr , and folks looked at him now . P325Nearly all of them had seen him yesterday stand up in court . Curiosity and something else held their eyes . He knew , as if they had used words , what they were thinking . What was it like , being a young feller who stood up for white trash and niggers ? How did it feel ? What did his wife think ? What did he and his kin talk about at meals ? They looked as if they were trying to see him in some way alien . Some folks would not step aside for him  --  their way of saying he was different . Some hawked and spat as he passed  --  not at him but to clear their thoughts  --  and turn their eyes and their whole bodies to watch him . Some said " Howdy , Lawyer , " in sly voices , waiting to hear the tone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their hands and said " Howdy " with a clasp . All followed him in . Today they followed him into the courthouse , not Tom Dorr . He was leading them to something better titan a buryin ' or a marryin ' or a preachin ' . They followed gladly , crowding onto the benches , while he went up ahead and took his scat at a table . The room was twenty-four hours dirtier , with tobacco droppings and nutshells and the dirt of boots . It was hotter and noisier too , as if the people of Lexington had made this room a part of their bodies . Court-room was theirs ; they waited for it twice a year . The benches were theirs ; they pushed and shoved , laughing ; someone sprawling in the aisle to bring notice and laughter to himself . They squatted on the floor , in the window embrasures , happy , swinging heels , calling out jokes . Well-settled citizens talked low and soberly with frowns at the merrymakers . Simon studied the jury again as they filed in and sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( lone right in agreeing to that stringy necked fellow ? Should he have studied longer over the blackbeardedman ? Treat him like a sinner if he knew  --  if he only knew ! He said Howdy with a smile to Harry who slid into the seat beside him . Then , because he could see that Harry was still haggard with fear , he talked of ordinary things in a commonplace voice , and when he saw the sweat still standing on Harry 's forehead , put his hand on his shoulder and held it there until the judge entered . The judge finished the formalities . The attorneys for both sides explained their hopes and intentions . Then the judge gave leave to call the first witness . Mead stood up and took off his spectacles , P326hunched up his shoulders , looked around the court-room , and called out in his fidgety voice , " Milly Rickard ! " Everyone strained , conversation buzzed , benches scraped , till tin judge banged his gavel . Harry looked sideways , out of the corner of his eye . Simon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : fiery red and giggling a little . She giggled when the oath was administered , then she fell silent and a slow wonder and fright grew in her eyes . Simon watched her fingers , brown and heavy-jointed , seeking comfort from each other , finally creeping to the seat of the chair and gripping it with all their might . Not that she had need to fear Mr. Mead . He spoke softly and respectfully . He did not ask questions that needed thoughtful answers . " You come along that road like you did every night , is n't that so ? " " He 's leading the witness , your Honor . " " Mr. Mead , mind you do n't coach the witness . " " Well then  --  did you come along that road every night ? " " Yes , sir . " " So a person watching would know you came always at the same time ? " " Yes , sir . " " And this Harry . . . " Your Honor ! " " This Harry . . . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This defendant . . . tell what happened . " " Walkin ' down the road . . . " the heavy fingers caught the chair , the bare toes spread out flat against the floor . " . . . I did n't pay no mind , thinkin ' wuz a titty bird . It called ag'in an ' I turned out of the way . But it war n't no titty bird . Was a nigger hidin ' in the bushes , layin ' hands on me an ' rippin ' at my skirt . " " Did you holler good ? " Mr. Mead asked , his spectacles off , his shoulders hunched . " Hollered like a stuck pig . " Her flat , rough-skinned face was turned to him as if she were afraid to loose her glance . The pale eyes did not flicker . Only the toes moved on the floor , curling and flattening out . " Then ? "   " Then he swopped me acrost the mouth and rasseled me , and there war n't no two ways fer me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair and her voice thinned to a whimper . " He was a mean It urtin ' nigger . " Simon spoke up sudden and clear . " For that statement , your Honor , I demand a mistrial . " The judge peered and his old eyes did not waver . At length he turned to the jury . " That was a prejudicial statement the witness made . The court orders you to disregard it . Mind you 're not inIIuenced . " Mr. Mead fidgeted until he could resume his questioning . Then he said softly , leaning forward so that his pot-belly rested against the back of a chair , " Is that nigger in this here room ? " Her eyes did not leave his face . " Yes , sir . " " Point him out . Say his name . " She drew her feet back under the chair and her head moved with a misery of slowness . She looked at Simon first , steadily for a moment , and blinked . Then she continued on to Harry . " That 's him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Him a-settin ' there . Like I said afore . Harry . " The audience rustled and shuffled their feet . Benches squeaked eagerly . A low vibration of breath-sound passed over the room . " You 're mighty sure , " Mr. Mead insisted , nosing and poking with his voice . She looked at him with dull wonderment . " I said so fust time . " There was a cold eagerness in Mr. Mead 's voice . " Did you tell a soul about this happening ? " " Wuz a stumblin ' out of the bushes and seen Brack Brett . He kept a-saying , Tell who ! Tell who ! ' but I could n't nohow say the name . He kept a-hollerin ' , and lie tuk up a-hollerin ' at my Pap . Time cum my Pap said , ' Tell who . ' " She was out of breath . The sweat stood out above her yellow eyebrows . She opened her lips and closed them again , though her eyes never left Mr. Mead . He pressed his belly against the chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just what happened . " " Time later , I cum to Lexington . Brack Brett was a-standin ' thar by the store . He sez , Tell who ! Tell who ! ' " Her voice was whimpering a little . She moved her toes uneasily . " Then I seed P328the nigger goin ' down the road . An ' I tuk aholt-a Brack Brett and tolt him what . " Even Mr. Mead heard the end of her sentence with difficulty . He stood silent for a moment , as if waiting for the words to cone to him . " You 've took an oath . So that 's the truth ? " She looked at him wildly for a second , straining her eyes and her body . " Why you askin ' that ? " " That 's all you did ? You just pointed your finger and said , That 's him , ' and then you come on home ? " Her lips were still angry . " Yes . " Mr. Mead put on his spectacles abruptly . " Your witness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about his ears , looking neither at Milly or Simon or the judge , busy with papers which he spread at his end of the table . Simon rose quickly . The position of a boundary line . . . the loss of a cow . . . the threat of revenue officers . . . riding circuit in the mountains . A heap of difference between life and death . When folks were on the side of living , their voices could not get hoarse and their thoughts go helter-skelter  --  like his . He paused for a moment , his fists resting on the table , wrestling with the intimidations of this time and moment . " I 'm mighty interested in some of the things Milly Rickard 's been sayin ' . " His voice was clear and loud and gave a promise that straightened the audience in their seats . " And I 'd like to ask a question or two . " He paused and looked at her in silence long enough for her toes to open and flatten on the floor . " What time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Wuz after sundown . " " After sundown . That means to say , after dark . Right ? " Her toes opened and spread again . He watched her , and asked slowly , " How can you say , positively , after dark , that this Harry was the man ? " Mr. Mead rose tentatively as if to give his client support . Her mouth opened , and she remained open-mouthed for a minute or two . " Could tell it , " she finally said . " How ? " " Jest could . " " Now how ? In the dark bushes , in the night . ' Less , of course , you had been there before the same way . " P329Mr . Mead shouted a protest . The audience banged , booed , laughed , until the judge brought order . Simon said softly , " Fact is , you ca n't even say for sure it was a Negro . " " Wuz a nigger , " she persisted with a concentrated stolidity . A voice shouted from the audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nigger in the dark ! " The judge spoke angrily . The voice was stilled . " You 'll have to say how you knew in the dark . " She stared at him a moment longer , and then a shrewdness curled her mouth . " His kinky hair . I was a-fightin ' hard , and I laid aholt of his kinky hair . " Her eyes gleamed . She could not keep the grin Isom her face . Simon considered for a moment , then he called , " Larry , step up where the judge and jury can see you . " He took Harry by the arm and turned him around . " Straight as yours or mine . " He pretended indifference now that the point had been made . I fe considered Milly Rickard from his position by the table . " You told Mr. Mead that he ripped at your dress . " Her eyes fixed on him , she nodded . He turned swiftly to the judge . " Why was n't the torn dress brought into court , your Honor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held her dress tight to her and answered before the judge could speak : " I 'm a-wearin ' it . " " A-wearin ' it ' ! " Simon echoed . " Stand up then and let the jury sec where it 's been mended . " A dark , slow anger grew in her eyes . " I ai n't mended nothin ' , " she answered sullenly . Simon heard the buzz , the rustle , the shuffle of feet until the judge pounded for order . " You fought and rasseled , yet there 's no torn dress . . . The judge interposed . " Did any doctor or reliable witness examinethis young woman for bruises , Mr. Mead ? " Mr. Mead stared at the judge for a moment before lie said , " I reckon any such would have healed ' fore she identified this here trigger to Mr. Brett . " Simon interposed swiftly . " Is n't it a fact you 've gone into those bushes with other men ? " Mr. Mead jumped to his feet . " You cai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Let her answer for herself . " She did not answer . She stared , with sweat on her brow . Ile pressed her remorselessly . " Is n't it a fact that being mighty poor you 'd take any gifts no matter where they came from ? " She was still silent , biting the inside of her lip . " Is n't it a fact that you were scared a-plenty and thought something bad would happen if your careless ways were found out ? " She said " No " hoarsely . " But you know for a fact that you would have pointed out any Negro coming down the road into Lexington the time Brack Brett got you scared a-plenty . " Mr. Mead cried angrily , " He 's scaring the witness out of knowingyes ' from no ' ! " Simon answered quickly , " No proof of any kind has been offered to show that this girl Tasseled for her virtue  --  no torn dress , no injuries  --  noproof that my client 's property was within five miles of the alleged rape . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughts were now wonderfully sharp . Mr. Mead ( lid not look at Simon as he pushed himself to his feet . He said " Brack Brett " in a voice with . no patience , and he waited , unpeaceful , for Brack Brett to understand that his name had been called . Brack Brett came up slowly , his eyes narrow and moving from one to another . He was a poor man . The way his hair fell about his ears , the way his trousers hung , the way he fingered his hat made this clear . There was a lank sorrow about his poverty , as if it were a mean thing wherever met , but meaner than a man could reckon when felt by Brack Brett . He sat in the witness chair unreconciled ; prepared to accept no affronts of tone , words , or gestures , however rigged out in law . There was no humor in his antagonism ; it was an antagonism which had its roots in the mean hat and the baggy trousers . Long anger had shaped his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He sat staring at Mr. Mead with an unblinking defiance . Mr. Mead spoke with a sharp briskness . " Brack Brett , you tell what happened that day you met Milly Rickard coming out of the woods . " Brett stared , thinking about Mr. Mead . His eyes went to the judge , sizing him up . He looked briefly at Simon , slitting his eyelidsa little . He opened and closed his hand , watching the motions . After awhile he spoke .   " Wuz n't nothing to tell , ' ceptin ' I seed a nigger run out of them woods , lickety hell bent , fastenin ' up his pants , then I seed Milly a-comin ' same way . I git maddern a coot when she start a-runnin ' too and I holler till she stop . She do n't know who ' t were , she say ; she jest a-rasseled , and when she clone rasselin ' she guve in . Reckoned she knew but wuz ' shamed to tell . " Simon interrupted . " Objection , your Honor . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The judge spoke over to the jury . " You heard what Milly Rickardtestified for herself . Disregard what this witness says that she said . " " Yer Honor . . . " That 's what I hold , Mr. Mead ! " Mr. Mead knocked a tattoo with his spectacles against the table , and posed his next question with a heavy hand . " You 've known Milly Rickard for a long time , and you know she tells the truth . " Brett narrowed his eyes again . " Knowed her for a long time . " He considered the worn patch on his trouser leg . " An ' I seed something with my own eyes . " " Tell now why you were so set on finding who the Negro was ? " Brett stared longer than at any time . " Were n't it a nigger ? " A flicker crossed Mr. Mead 's face . He looked with a half smiletoward the jury and with a brief side glance at the judge . " So you reckoned that her Pa would sec it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reckoned so . " " Did he ? " Brett looked away slowly toward the place where Lex Rickard sat and gave himself time for thought . " Lex ai n't a man t ' git riled . I do n't guess he said a word t ' me . Kinda picked at hisself , but did n't pay no mind it seemed . " " Then how do you explain Milly Rickard tellin ' you at last ? " He studied for awhile . " She seed the nigger comin ' down the road a second time . Ai n't that enough ? " " You did n't scare her into tellin ' ? You just let it come easy-like ? " " I do n't hold with wimmen , " Brett said softly . " They ai n't .. . " You just answer what you 're asked . " He pondered Mead . " 1 ' 11 answer what I got to say . " Mead said quickly , " Your witness , Mr. Bliss . " Simon stood up . His eyes went to the audience . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a simple preoccupation with justice . He was not the first man who must teach the meaning of justice . Then his eyes faltered , and a slow smile came in his heart . There by the door , modest in a wide cloak , face high colored and eager , sat Savanna with Nance beside her . His eyes had only a moment to spare . She did not try to hold him by any sign of recognition , and he came back swiftly to the little world of jurymen and witnesses . But there was a quickening in his blood and a vivacity on his tongue which made him want to laugh aloud and settle the law according to the best in humanity . He smoothed back his unruly , black hair , and there was a sharp sudden joy in his roving eyes . " Mr. Brett , a while ago you said you saw a Negro come out of the bushes that night , buttoning up his pants . If you could see him as close as that , how was it you could n't identify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else . " " Wuz night time , " Brett answered . " Not too dark to see him buttoning up his pants . " Brack Brett took a measure of him , and shot his glance at Mead . Then he tightened his lips . Simon said clearly , " You could n't see that he was a Negro  --  that 's what you mean to say by your silence . You did n't see a Negro running away , at all , Mr. Brett . Maybe there was n't anyone there but you and Milly Rickard ? " Someone whistled in the back of the court-room , and a low , excited laugh swept the back rows . " Yer Honor . . . " Mead smacked his fist against the table . The judge said mildly , " He 's only asking Mr. Brett a question . " " Wuz a nigger , " Brett said , unmoved , his eyes still slit . " We 'd be thankful to know how you knew , Mr. Brett . " " She said so . " " She 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What kind of truth , Mr. Brett ? That she 's no better than she ought to be ? That she ducks into bushes every whip-stitch ? That she does n't know one man from another in the dark ? " Voices shrilled , " You take back them words , Si Bliss ! " " He cai n't talk that way about no white woman ! " Simon spoke savagely toward the jury . " I 'm interested in justice , and nothing else . I do n't aim to see justice perjured and bandied about in this court-room . Now , Mr. Brett , can you answer my questionswith a yes or a no ? " P333Brett was coldly surly . " She hai n't done none of them things . " " How do you know ? " " I jes ' know . " Simon swung to the jury . " He just knows . Do you take testimony like that ? When you saw her , Mr. Brett , stumbling out of the bushes , was she disheveled ? Was her dress torn ? Was her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throat , maybe , where he 'd have held her if she had fought him ? " Brett was silent , his lips pressed together , his eyes half closed . " The witness must answer , " the judge prodded . " Cai n't recollect . " " Maybe you knew things like this had happened before . Did you , Mr. Brett ? " He took his time to answer . " She said ' t was a nigger . " " You could n't help but believe her ? You knew Milly Rickard had never done a wrong thing in her life ? You knew she was a pure girl ? You knew she had been brought up so carefully that lying and fornicatin ' were n't in her ? " Someone guffawed in the audience . Brett 's eyes dulled . The statement he was supposed to confirm was broader than his capacities to handle . " You knew she had a name pure as your own daughter 's ? " Brett 's lips puckered . He shot a glance at the judge . He said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge . " " Oh , to your best knowledge ? Why do n't you say Yes ? Why do you qualify ? You would n't vouch for her ? Why ? " Brett sat rigid-still , his eyelids unblinking . " White woman said it was a nigger . Wuz the truth as far as I keered . " The judge banged against the swollen sound of voices , banged three times before he could attain a partial silence . Simon listened to Dorr 's swift words in his car , but remained quiet in spirit and outer man . He waited until his voice could be heard easily in the room . " You mean it did n't matter to you who she said it was  --  you did n't care whether it was rape or not  --  so long as the man in the bushes was a Negro ? " Mead was on his feet before the sentence had been half begun . " Mr. Bliss is tryin ' to put words in the mouth of my witness , yer Honor ! " The judge was an old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P334already said it was the truth so far as he cared . Proceed , Mr. Bliss . " Mr. Bliss said : " My question 's answered . " Brett considered his hat and the torn place on his trousers . " Wuz a nigger . " " In the dark , running , it was still a Negro . All right . You told her that it was a Negro , since she could not see him either ? And then you kept at her  --  ' Tell who he was . Tell who he was '  --  until you scared her out of her wits ? " Brett was suddenly mindful of the ring in his nose . His caution became concentrated . " Who sez that 's so ? " " Nobody says so . I asked a question . " Brett 's thin eyes surveyed him . " Iffen she wuz skeered wuz a reason . She said , ' That 's him , a-comin ' ' long the road , ' and you heered her here , sayin ' the same thing . " Simon did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somethingpowerful in his way of standing , in the lift of his head , in the bright and knowing eyes . " You knew who he was  --  you could identify the Negro comin ' down the road ? " " By gum ! " " Are you a poor man , Brack Brett ? " " Do n't cotton to that question . " " Then  --  times have been hard ? " " Five bales  --  p'int-blank . " " And Tom Dorr and his black fellers get a heap more'n that ? " " Hear-tell . " " It sets a man thinkin ' , does n't it ? " The thin , pale eyes were unblinking . " What wud you say ? " Simon came around the table and sat on the edge , friendly-like . " I 'd say yes . Might n't it even make a feller want to get even ? " Mr. Mead struck the table with his hand . " This ai n't got a thingto do with the evidence ! " Simon turned to the judge . " Seems like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this matter . " " Mind your words , Simon Bliss , " the judge said . " Weigh them careful . " " Why did n't you ask Milly Rickard to identify the Negro before witnesses ? " Brett was angry and reckless .   " They wuz a hull heap of fellers around Randy 's cud identify him once they heered . " Simon returned behind the table . " So you took the law in your own hands ? " Brett considered now a wider circle , of judge , jury , and audience , his eyes moving , though his head turned only slightly . He looked at the audience longer than any , so long that the judge rapped on his desk with a pencil . " Fellers at Randy 's all figgered on Milly 's story . Sheriff was a-chewin ' and he figgered he 'd hev to go along to see how-what . We traipsed down to Cal Smith 's where we seed the nigger goin ' , and we seed them behavin ' friendly-like . Sheriff figgered how the law worked , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " What more did you do to help the law ? " " War n't no more to do . " He looked at Simon with a trapped shrewdness , his lower lip folded out beyond the upper . " It pleasured me mightily to git that black sonofabitch whar he could n't unbuttonhis pants save t ' piss . " Simon turned away abruptly and returned to his seat . " No more questions . " Mr. Mead was slow to rise . Simon listened to the next witness with meticulous interest but with half a mind . He saw things whole , no longer in fragments , and the whole was shaped into his kind of justice . He did not allow himself hope , for the jurymen 's faces were the raggle-taggle of boredomset free , wonder released , preconceptions full shaped . But he felt something astir , something set surely , like the master-thread which a woman sets in her weaving . A black man and a white man hoodwinked by justice , would somehow be freed through the words of their accusers . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his great clenched man 's fist on his man 's thigh to steady his thinking . But he stole a glance at Savanna , for there was truth and reality in Savanna , and full staying power . Her head turned with his , and her lips smiled slightly and she continued to look at him as long as his eyes were on her . Soon he would talk to her , find out what-forHe was glad when the judge banged for dinner recess . It was a good time to let things sink into other men 's heads  --  and his own . He went swiftly to Savanna , and stood before her looking at her for a moment , a smile pulling at his lips though his face remained grave . She answered in a matter-of-fact way , with lowered eyes , " It was silly thinking I 'd stay waiting . I told you where I belonged . " P336She lifted her eyes to him , swift dove-like eyes that did not deceive him . The smile broke on his lips . Her hand went out for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " My heart , " she said very softly . Tom Dorr came up , angry and iron-faced . " You 'll make her go home , " he said to Simon . " Make her ? " Simon answered . " Could you , Pa Dorr ? " " This is no place for a woman , looking like she does ! " " I 've got a big cloak on , " Savanna said calmly , " and I know how to sit and when to stand . Now find us a nice quiet room at Joby Milligan 's , and we 'll have dinner in peace . " Later she said , " ' Pears like Simon 's a good lawyer . He points up things Mr. Mead forgets all about . But we 've got a heap of watching to do yet if I know my own county folks . You 'll be glad I brought Nance , soon as you find out what good ears and eyes she 's got . " He felt the fine wonder that comes to a man when he knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back carefully to the courthouse , where she insisted on waiting modestly until everyone was seated until she slipped in at the rear . They called Lex Rickard next , but he had no facts or opinions . He fingered his single gallus and stared at Mr. Mead and stared at the judge when they spoke to him , and fingered his fly-buttons and stared at them again , and finally said , " Reckon so , " when his mind had been bludgeoned by their questions . As Simon rose he looked at Lex . A man with a kind of poor , wan dignity , unshaven like the patriarchs , dirty like the wandering prophets , fearful-eyed like men since the days of Cain .. . He had no better luck than the others . " Uh-huh , " Lex said , and " Reckon " and " Cai n't say . " Simon paused . Lex was no better witnessfor the prosecution than the defense . Lex looked at him with his faded eyes set in their white lashes , looked slyly and spoke suddenand low . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and spoke for , but you did n't brung them ' taters like you said . " The crowd laughed . Mr. Mead humphed and looked toward the jury . Simon said , unabashed , " Those ' taters disappeared . Funny thing . Seems like that youngun of yours is wearing the sack for his breeches . But that do n't tell where the ' taters went . I want to ask one question , and tell me a true answer . Did you tell your daughterP337to say that Harry was the feller lay on her ? Just answer that  --  a plain yes or no . " Lex sucked at his empty gums , his faded eyes turned to the floor . He went on sucking when the judge told him to answer . His jaws were quiet but his eyes were still lowered when the judge rapped on the desk . Simon leaned against the table . Success or failure did not depend on Lex 's answer , but he would be grateful for small favors . Lex said , " Them ' taters wud 've made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got my belly so sot on a thing . " The judge pounded . " Answer up like yer supposed to  --  yes or no ! " " Them ' taters  --  " He looked at the judge . " Maw and Milly said he 'd never bring them ' taters . They got a hankerin ' ... " " Yes or no ! " " I 'm a-tellin ' you , best way I kin . " That was all . Simon let him go . Simon sat behind his table and listened , his hands clenched under his chin , to the throat-hawkings and the verbal wonderings and the long yeses and noes of the other few witnesses . Tom Dorr sat in the witness chair for a few minutes , saying " Yes " and " No " angrily . " Will you recollect exactly , Mr. Dorr , where your slave Harry was on this night in question , just about sundown ? " Tom Dorr said impatiently , " He was checkin ' with me an ' Jess Newton , same as he did for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 'd have known positively if he had been absent ? " " Absent ? He 'd have gotten plain hell . Nor he nor I would have forgot . " The heat made them all short-tempered , the answers abrupt . The crowd was bound to get all that it could for its own satisfaction . Since a black man 's testimony was not admissible , his master must say whether he would be subject to the lusts of other men or mindful , above all things , of his condition and color . The gallusedaudience stirred , and hollered ribaldry at Tom Dorr , advisingor mocking him , doubting his testimony . The frock-coated audience tried to silence them , but were outnumbered . The air grew more suffocating . Mr. Mead tried to shake Tom Dorr 's testimony , but was left with a mouthful of words . He tried to say , " If you lose this case , you lose a valuable piece of property , do n't you , Mr. Dorr ? " but Tom Dorr said , " You think I want a rapin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disgrace to the bar , Mr. Mead . " P338Simon glanced at Savanna and saw her with her eyes closed , leaning against Nance . He motioned Nance to take her out , but Savanna resisted and sat then with her eyes open . The noise deepened . The judge was angered and banged his gavel , and wiped his forehead and neck with a calico handkerchief . But no silence came till Mr. Mead said , " That 's all the witnesses , your Honor . Move for adjournment . " The judge stared at him coldly . " You 're not the only birds on the tree , Mr. Mead . Court-week 's jam-packed with cases . You two will say your say to the jury without more ado . " Simon took a moment to glance at his notes . In the front of his mind the pattern was shaping , for good or for ill . They were his folks , those men on the jury bench , his kith and kin , dirty , earthy , ignorant ; his kin who had once made a brave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a task to be done overnight . He wondered what they would think if he spoke to them in those terms , what his mountain folk would think if he used such words to them . Words were chary and uncertain tools . Show a man , and be . What else was there ? But now he must stand up and defend a man 's property , property which he did not rightly think was his , and use words which fitted the pattern of his shaping thoughts and yet were discreet . How could a man be two things at once ? He looked down at Harry 's feet , still as death , and wondered what discretions would be set aside when the day of reckoning came . He had no great choice of words . By law , Harry could be hanged , and his master paid his value , for the crime of rape . He would have to talk of the sanctity of property and not much else . Liberty without life would be quite useless to Harry . Later he could take up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Harry 's mind. . . you 're men of judgment , friends , not beholden to any man for your values or opinions . True , as the County Attorney has said , a man sets a mighty store on his property , when it 's worth fifteen hundred dollars . Would n't I be as much a fool to deny it as you would be if someone set fire to your hayricks or looted your barn ? We 're men of sense . Let 's stay that way . " So think along with me for a minute . A respectable citizen , whom you all know , a good Democrat , a good Methodist , a good neighbor , a good friend when you 're in trouble  --  as a heap of folks can testify  --  has fifteen hundred dollars invested in solid property . P339Let 's say it 's a barn . Got a year 's pull of fodder , got cotton all baled and ready , got corn and ' taters , and livestock . Then a fire starts . Illen folks do n't move fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , goin ' wine clown faster'n a bear on a greased pole . What are you going to think of the fellers who say , Cai n't do anything about saving Neighbor Dorr 's investment till we ask Long Johnny or Grandsir Thistletop . They 've been talking and saying . . . ' and then the barn starts to burn . Seems Long Johnny or old Grandsir only heard talk . Somebody said a thing they had n't seen . They did n't know for sure , but they thought . . . . But Neighbor Don 's barn has n't stopped burning . You see how it is . If we 've got sure-fire evidence  --  somebody whose word you could n't doubt  --  that Neighbor Dorr set his own barn afire .. . " Same here . What kind of evidence have we got about Neighbor Dorr 's fifteen hundred dollar black boy ? Hearsay evidence . A girl scared out of her wits . Somebody tellin ' somebody else . Somebody thinking this , doubting that , repeating the other . But the barn 's burning down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smart men . When a thing . . . He finished within a few minutes . He felt the sweat running clown under his shirt . He wiped his brow and his hands , and went to sit down at the table near Tom Dorr . Dorr had an expression on his face that could pass for a smile . Certainly he did not look displeased . The audience hawked and spat and stirred ; a few applauded , though the judge pounded quickly . Some of the jurymen continued to look at Simon after he had sat down , as if they were not yet through with him or his . words . Mr. Mead was fidgety , and poked at his papers . At length he took off his spectacles and stood up. " . . . and the evidence shows without a shadow of a doubt that this slave feller , Harry , property of Thomas J. Dorr , attacked and assaulted and ravished this white woman , Milly Rickard . A woman 's honor is as sacred as the holy Scriptures  --  it 's bound round and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's assaulted and iolated . There 's no sin  --  mind , I 'm telling you  --  as grievous as the sin of forcing a woman into unnatural acts . And one thing we know is true , no matter what might be thought of by mean fellers here and there about the way of speaking and ignorance of this victim here , there 's no getting around the fact that it 's an unnatural act and most grievous sin to have relations with a Negro . No two P340ways . No white woman submits willingly to a nigger . That nigger forced her or she ai n't a white woman ... . . . now we 've had identification by our best citizens . Brack Brett owns his own farm and has votin ' power . He testified honest and straightforward . Sheriff testified honest . You believe him ' cause you have to believe your own sheriff who 's got the right and the wrong of the law closer'n his own name . . . . ... sure a man with slave property , money invested , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over to the law . Sure he 'll say he 's religious and moral and well brung up . Just remember that . Weigh those things good . Ask yourself , Is property everything ? Is n't the safety and purity of your wives and daughters set higher than a thousand dollars ? Are your wives and daughters safe ? That 's the only question worth asking yourself ! " Simon listened with his hand shading his eyes . Mr. Mead said his say in different ways for half an hour . Simon barely listened . Harry , breathing as quiet as death , sat behind him , afraid to draw attention to himself , sitting stiller than a fallen log .. . Simon dropped his hand and fell to studying the jury . The stringy throated fellow was tapping on his chair with his fingers and staring out the window . The black bearded fellow was cleaninghis nails with a splinter taken from his chair . The bushy-headed fellow was leaning forward listening attentively . The fellow in the brown homespun was grinning slyly at his neighbor as if titillated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one could of it . The judge turned in his weather-beaten dignity and spoke the concluding words . He spoke of the sanctity of property and also of white women . But he spoke last about property . Then he remanded the jury to the care of the sheriff , and said that court was adjourned for the day . Grandpa was as curious as a coot-bug . There was n't a thing he forgot to ask about . Tom remembered one thing , Simon another , and Savanna tied them together . ( " You ai n't going tomorrow  --  not over my dead body , " Ma said to her angrily . " Shamefulest thing I ever knew . " ) Savanna took a spoonful of turnips from the dish Nance held . " I reckon you 'd better take Nance with you tomorrow . She heard a power of things today that you 'd better watch out for tomorrow . " Simon looked at Nance quickly . " Like what ? "  | " That Mr. Willie Johnson , " Nance said , her face shining in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sake . He did n't pay no mind to what was goin ' on in cou't . He was a-talkin ' and a-talkin ' to some no-good kin of the Rickards during the speech-makin ' . " Simon cut at his chops with an eye on Grandpa . Grandpa said with his glance fixed on Nance , " Some folks never could forget those vigilante raggle-taggles , ridin ' pell-mell for murderback in the ' 3o 's . Willie Johnson 's Pa never got done admirin ' them . Would n't do no harm rememberin ' that , Tom . Just sup-posin ' . " " They 're decent folks ! " " It 's decent folks in our part of the world who are back of most of the trouble . " Simon came into town early the next morning . He looked into the faces of the men who were already gathered into groups . He wished that men who were planning trouble wore a badge of some sort . He went to see Cal Smith . " They 'll call you up today , or I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How would you feel ? " " Uh-huh . " " My wife sneaked in last night and brought a clean shirt . Reckon I could do with a shave . " " Reckon we 'll get you a shave and a haircut . They 'd like to keep you looking like a bushwacker to give them a talking-point . " Cal Smith held the fingers of one hand tight with the other . " How are things going ? " Simon laid a hand on his shoulder . " You know you are different from Harry . You are n't valuable to anyone but yourself . " The whiteness around Cal 's eyes sharpened . " But we understand each other . You 'll get every last ounce of fight that there is in me . " The holiday spirit flared brighter . Benches and window embrasureswere fought for by old tenants . The world was roaring by , as big as sin , in Washington and New York and New Orleans , but for a week nobody cared . There had been a cock-fight the night before , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This was the world . The stove burned eagerly with peanut shells , sizzled with tobacco juice . Somebody knew for cer-P342tain what the jury had decided , but he was n't tellin ' for fear he was wrong ! A Negro boy , owned by the court , collected bets on the verdict . " The verdict ? " Willie Johnson said , standing in the doorway . " I 'll give you the verdict for a swig of whisky and a round o ' squirrel shot . " The judge convened court and sat quietly , a fine and faded old man . The sheriff told him the jury was getting on its stocks and ties , and its galluses hitched up . He nodded . By fits and starts , the room was silent . Finally , the sheriff reappeared and said , " Here they cum . " " Gentlemen of the jury , what say you ? . . . Guilty or not guilty ? " The foreman who wore a tie and brown homespun stood up . " Not guilty , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The verdict was the verdict  --  most men could see both sides of this question . A man with a tract of land . . . or a slave . . . or a burnin ' barn . . . There were a few boos , but none that could not be drowned out by stamping feet . The judge said , " Silence ! We 'll clear the court and have quiet , ' less you do n't want to get on to the next case . " They were silent . A few friends silently pressed Tom Dorr 's hand and made a sign of congratulation to Simon . Mr. Mead unwound the spectacles from behind his ears . " Move we dismiss the jury . " Simon spoke up quickly . " Move we impanel the same jury ! " The judge said to Mr. Mead , " You 'd get some of the same chaps on a new jury . " Mead was stubborn . " I move a new jury . " The judge sighed . The new jury was hastily impaneled , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the checked shirt still serving . Sworn in , Mr. Mead grew impatient . He twisted the spectacles around his ears and looked around for the defendant . Cal Smith came in through the side door , more quickly than most expected , and went with a hurried trot to his seat . He was shaved and his hair was cut , and his fresh shirt gleamed above his shabby coat . The court-room was electrified . Men leaned forward and stood up ; tenants of the windows catcalled and booed , even P343the well-mannered rose hastily for a better look and exchanged quick reflections with their neighbors . Cal looked at the audience swiftly , then dug his nails into his palms . Mr. Mead was swift with the indictment and the first witness . The sheriff testified , dry , flat-faced , careful with his words . " He seed through the window . . . he got that paper . . . " " Why did you think Cal Smith was doing something wrong ? " " ' Cause he 's got a had name with niggers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. . " Caleb Bowers , you swear to tell . . . only the truth .. " Cal Smith did n't say a word , not a word . Got white and peaky-lookin ' . Guilty as sin , I said to myself ... ' " Knowed he was friendly to niggers ... " " Brack Brett , say again what you said before . . . " ' . . . shakin ' hands . Harry wuz grinnin ' all over . Cal Smith madea run for the back door Heck Richards . . . LesMorison . . . " Simon stood up . " ' Pears to me it 's time to read that paper that Cal Smith gave to Harry , and see what was so bad . I request the court to read the paper taken off Dorr 's Harry and written down by Cal Smith . " The clerk was a deacon . He read Scriptures powerfully . But he stumbled a mite at this reading . Words read differently , when written out by hand and read aloud a court-room . " The base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despised hath God chosen ; yea , and things which are not , to bring to nought things which are . " " He that doth steal a man and sell him , shall surely he put to death . " " Hide the outcasts . Let the oppressed go free . " " That ai n't Scripture , " he said , putting clown the paper without fuss . There was a powerful quiet . By God , it sounded like Scripture , no matter what the clerk said . It had the ring of Scripture . But what ( lid it say ! " Go to now , ye rich men , weep and howl for your miseries . . . Behold the hire of the laborers who have reaped down your fields crieth , and the cries of them are entered into the cars of the Lord . " . . . " I have seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt and I am come clown to deliver them .. . Sounds like Scripture , but whoever heard such Scripture ! " ' Tai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says it 's not Scripture ? " Simon roared , springing to the great Bible lying on the clerk 's desk . " The Lord knows His own P344Holy Word . " He shoved the Bible toward the clerk . " Read it ! " he demanded , and called off chapter and verse . They listened , matching words to words , and sat silent , bereft of speech , mouths working silently here and there , eyes wondering and angry . Simon allowed the silence to deepen . He stood with his hand on the Bible , towering by the jury bench , a mighty spokesman of the Lord . The tenants of the windows stopped beatingtheir heels against the wall ; those who had stood up in wonderingwrath sat down again . Simon said finally , his voice low but mighty , " You heard clear ? Will the clerk testify that he read those words himself out of his own Holy Book ? " They were silent , without challenges . Simon held them for a moment longer in the shadow of their sin . Then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by and by , that Cal Smith is a pious man , a good Baptist . He 's got the fire of the Lord eatin ' him up ... . " How come a good , pious black like that Harry needs Scripture ? " A voice called out , " Who called on Cal Smith to teach him ? " " Cal Smith , you come and testify to your own doing . " Cal Smith , sitting in the chair , his chin stiff , a strange steady sadness in his eyes , looked as if the Lord had well-nigh forgotten his own . Spindle shanks and hollow cheeks came not from the Lord 's vineyard but from the scarcity of meat and potatoes . His voice was so low that folks at the rear yelled at him to speak up . " I ai n't done nothin '  --  no time  --  but the Lord 's work . He says , ' Do unto others like you 'd be done by . ' I figgered I cai n't do wrong following that . " " I seed Cal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a nigger jest like . . . " The judge banged and threatened to clear the court . There was a different temper here than at Harry 's trial . Simon knew that he must fight it before it rose too high . " There 's a Christian decency that does not scruple between black and white . There 's a Christian decency that takes the hand of blacks and calls them brother . You can like it or not like it , or write whopping words in law statutes , but that decency is what we call Christianity , and Holy Writ will prove it . Now let Cal Smith go on talking , the best way he can . " " I met Harry on the road one day and he was mighty perplexed . Wanted to know how this and that thing coulda been . I gave him  |p345Scri|pture  words , and he said he 'd like for to study them . He cum that day to take the writin ' I had made for him . " He paused and looked down at his hands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words at him . Simon tried to interpose ; the judge threatened . " Why did n't Harry ask his master the questions he was wonderin ' ?

Dan Masters and David Dixon spoke for the same reason , Simon knew . They were men of property and power , and they saw their property and power endangered if any in a court of law thought that
