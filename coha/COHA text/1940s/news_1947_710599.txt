txt " Flying platters " of meat con-fitted to soar at high levels toThrifty . New England housewives gave the price tags hardly more than a passing glance . Then , they turned again to poultry and fish as substitutes for the $1and-up steaks and chops . They may even perhaps have reflected a bit on old OPA prices as they contemplated that additional cent-a-quart boost in the price of milk , announced for September 1 . And , with the still high price of butter , they generally seemed to pass up the rather small ears of sweet corn at a dime apiece ? $1.20 a dozen . Fresh eggs , too , seemed to be following that upward spiral of steak prices . With food costs what they are today , salads , fruits , and vegetable plates seemed to go about as good as anything . Meat Price Gouge ' Meantime , a congressional inquiry into what has been widely referred to as " the meat price gouge " has been urged by members of the Massachusetts Retail Grocers and Provision Dealers Association . Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  at least as far as New Englanders are concerned  --  was supplied today by Malcolm McCabe , Executive Secretary of the Grocers Association , who is just back in Boston after attending the national grocers convention in San Francisco . Visiting some of California 's most colorful , eye-appealing , super de luxe markets , where sales volumes hit above S70,000 a week , and stopping at other cities on their way home to find some of the whys and wherefores of high meat prices , Mr. McCabe said that the general consensus of his fellow grocers was that  --  dollar for dollar  --  Bay State consumers are receiving far greater food values than exist anywhere else in the country . The National Grocers Association went on record  --  and was ably backed up by the Massachusetts grocers  --  in calling for a congressional investigation of the causes for the current high prices of meat . Various reasons have been advanced . They include : Monopoly control of meat exercised by the larger packers ; substantial wage increases in the meat packing industry and advancing costs of materials ; heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of shipments to slaughter by the meat producers . " We found on the Pacific Coast , which is even nearer the producer than New England , that meat prices were generally from 25 to 30 per cent higher than here , " said Mr. McCabe . " Kidney lamb chops were 31.25 a pound , and steaks from S1.85 to $1.95 . " Much of the beef , he added , did not rate as high in prime quality as that to which New Englanders are accustomed , some of it was from lean , range-fed animals , with very little fat . While the fat constitutes a double burden for the New England retailer , who has plenty of trimming to do , the beef , itself , is not as high in quality as that received here , Mr. McCabe said . Control Over Cattle He still contended that an " almost complete control over the cattle by the feeders " was one of the chief reasons for the higher prices . He also pointed out that the cutting off of meat importations from Mexico and Canada played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , the country imports only about 7 or 8 per cent of its total meat tonnage . This , in itself , is small . " But , when you operate on an already short market , this cutting off of these imports is reflected in firmer prices , " he said . A couple of weeks of warm , humid weather in mid-July contributed somewhat to a slackened demand ? on the part of many householders for beef and lamb . But , it was generally conceded that the excessively high prices had about as much to do with lessened purchases as had the weather . Most of the beef cuts , aside from steaks , hovered in the **28;278;TOOLONG price range , with tenderloin , sirloin , and porterhouse steaks soaring to $1.50 and up . Lamb , usually rated second in popularity , also is high , legs for 1 roasting being priced at 70 to 751 cents a pound , with kidney chops up to the 90-cent range .                  @ @ @
