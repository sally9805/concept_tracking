From Jerusalem , TIME 'S Don Burke cabled : <P> <P> This Christmas Week in the Holy Land , shepherds went armed , travelers to Bethlehem were shot at , and wise men stayed indoors . An atmosphere of fear , gloom and tense anxiety thickened . Man is against man , and over all Palestine there has been bitter fighting . <P> To see what Christmas Week was like this year , I toured the holy places . I started at Jerusalem 's Old City . Unlike old-time pilgrims , I needed an armed escort of British police . We entered at Jaffa Gate , headed down through the ancient Jewish quarter , where for ten days the Arabs had besieged some 3,500 Jews . Sniping still goes on day &; night . <P> Empty Houses ; As we walked down the narrow , cobblestoned , smelly streets , our footsteps clattered loudly . At the sound frightened faces pressed against windows , were reassured by the uniforms . Along Jews Street , the quarter 's center , only a few shops were open . Life in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arab violence flared up at the announcement of Palestine 's partition . Those Jews whom we did see clung closely to their doorsteps , ready to flee inside at the slight est warning . The only Jew oblivious to it all was a turbaned Moorish Jew , who sat silently leaning against a building in the sun begging for baksheesh . <P> As we went on we entered a stretch of no man 's land , a wide swatch of deserted houses left by Arabs and Jews who had lived side by side . The streets in front of these houses were littered with the debris of terror-old shoes , a battered wide-brimmed felt hat of an Orthodox Jew , an old scarf . One house 's door hung slantwise on a twisted hinge , as though its occupants had plunged wildly through it in mad haste . On the rooftops were British sentries with Bren guns . Also to be seen were rooftop Jewish guards-young Haganah members ; technically illegal , they were unarmed , but they kept arms within hand 's reach . <P> On the Arab side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Wailing Wall , worn smooth by centuries of kissing by devout Jews , shone brightly ; in the brilliant sunlight . There were no Jews there , and the three British constables guarding the wall said that none had visited the wall since trouble broke out . When we crossed the Old City to the First Station of the Cross on the Via Dolorosa , crowds of Moslems were coming out from Friday prayers at an Arab holy place , the Mosque of the Dome of the Rock ( often miscalled the Mosque of Omar ) . They all glanced sharply at me , but hurried on as they spotted my two constables . <P> " Some Excitement . " Along the Via Dolorosa all was dead . An Arab youngster bounced a ball against the plaque denoting the Third Station . At the Sixth Station , where Veronica wiped Christ 's face a Hebronite Arab brushed past silently , carrying an enormous tray of bread loaves . Christendom 's greatest sanctuary , the Church of the Holy Sepulchre , was indeed as though it were a place of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only Coptic and Orthodox priests swinging censers over Christ 's tomb , while in its dim reaches the Franciscans could be heard singing .
