The organism that causes one type of common cold has been isolated . So reported the U.S. Public Health Service 's Dr. Norman H. Topping and his assistant , Dr. Leon T. Atlas , in last week 's issue of Science . <P> In their search for the organism that British scientists hunted in vain for 18 months ( TIME , Dec. 22 ) , Drs . Topping and Atlas first used sterile skimmed milk to wash the nose of a man just catching cold . The solution was sprayed into the noses of volunteers ( inmates of the District of Columbia 's Lorton Reformatory , who were paid $3 a week ) . They caught cold , too . Washings were then transplanted into chick embryos ; solutions from the eggs produced the same thick " sinusitis-like " colds in other volunteers . All told , 57 of 60 human guinea pigs came down with colds . <P> Under the electron microscope , the cold-causing agent appeared to be " characteristic particles ... of the same general size as viruses of the influenza type , but . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physicians named the " germ " . V14A because it came from the first nasal washing of the 14th volunteer . <P> It is still too early to talk about curing or preventing colds-even the type of common cold caused by V14A . Dr. Topping ( who developed the first effective serum for Rocky Mountain spotted fever in 1940 ) would say only that a vaccine is " a possibility , not a probability . " ( It took ten years to develop a flu vaccine after the flu virus was isolated in 1933 . ) As a final gloomy thought , Dr. Topping feared that even if a vaccine is developed , it will give immunity for only a very short time , and , of course , against only one type of cold .
