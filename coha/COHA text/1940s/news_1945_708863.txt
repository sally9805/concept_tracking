txt Bernard M. Baruch , a figure in the world picture for many years , will celebrate his seventy-fifth birthday tomorrow . As he approaches that milestone he sees before him an America in which his confidence remains firm , and the way of life which he considers superior to any other . Close student of the globe for lecades , Mr. Baruch watches other economic systems without regret . Ele feels even more than ever that the American scheme of free enterprise must be our plan , no mater how much others may favor collectivism , whose popularity in some circles he ascribes to " po'itical emotionalism . " " The American people , " he says , " can do anything if you will tell them why , but you must tell them why . But they are never subordi nate to the state , as in some other lands . The state does not control them ; it comes to their assistance when they need it . " The tall financier and philanthropist was , of course , discussing the comparative merits of the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has risen so high in the heavens , But in the discussion he saw no need for the two to come into collision . Both , he said , could survive according to national preferences , only , our way is still the best for us . Russia and the United States , hel ruch 's family moved to New York when he was 11 , but he said his memory never loses the South and the Confederate veterans of whom his father was one . " Some of those old men must know that , " he mused , rocking on 87 at " Reconverted " his long legs . " Not long ago , a Uncle Confederate veteran in Mississippi missing column " I 'm making my second round trip , " he said with a twinkling eye . " The start , the war , the aftermath . " Deeply concerned with the prospects of the veterans as demobilization comes , he is having studies made of the respective benefits by this country and others for the fighting men released from service into an uncertain economic future . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been named as Retraining and Re-employment Administrator . A " Work Director , " Mr. Baruch said , " takes care of the human side . " Stresses " Human Side " " The human side of reconversion has not yet been activated properly , " he stated . " Where is the plan for absorbing the 10,000,000 enlisted men and women , the 8,000,000 war workers into the population , and giving them a chance to make a life of their own choice ? " Today , Mr. Baruch remarked , the world is crying for goods , and with American productive capacity so capable , we can , he added , see four or five years of prosperity ahead , even though " not much brains " are used . There will be confusion in reconversion , for a time , but the change from war to peace will come quickly , due to the American resources of management , machine equipment and workers ' special skills . As a program , Mr. Baruch said , Congress should4map a post-war tax plan , and work to slash the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effected . Taxes must remain high for a time to pay for the war , but reduction , as soon as feasible , will spur business endeavor . A public works program , and expansion of unemployment compensation and social security benefits are necessaries , Mr. Baruch believes . Interests Never Flag Seventy-five years have made no difference to him , Mr. Baruch remarked . " I find I am still interested in the same things and am looking into the future , not the past . If I start looking backwards , I 'll quit . Ladies are still the most charming things in the world . I guess I am no older and no wiser . " As his birthday neared , it was a surprise to find that the millionaire who began as a $3 per week broker 's clerk , has never depended on the charts and graphs so dear to the economist . " Those things dismay me , " he said . " Anyway , when I want to buy something ; a mine , for instance , I never go to see it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report to me . " Born in Camden , S. C. , Mr. Ba missing column went on , could remain friends and must do so . " But we do not need to adopt any part of their way of life ; we can keep to our interests , " he commented . " Our political and economic system saved the world in two wars . It will save the peace if given a chance . We can have a prosperity that will startle the world if we use half the brains and brawn the good Lord gave us ; even 471/ per cent will make for peace and high living standards . But we ca n't marry our system to another and keep our strength . If we do , there will be a divorce and somebody will wake up dead . " Still Virile and Alert Many men are feeble , or at least , growing listless of life at 75 . Mr. Baruch , however , is a virile , towering figure , endowed with a powerful frame . His eyes are clear , bright , expressive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His only concession to his years , he explained , was a hearing device . Alert , in touch with the world of 1945 , and eager for its meanings , Mr. Baruch deems years purely relative things and promises to live many more . When he was asked , to supply a reasop for his remarkable vitality , he answered " The Lord Almighty . " Yet he went on to point out instances of longevity in his family . One of his aunts recently died at 95 ; another lives , at 99 . His father , who emigrated to South Carolina in 1855 and served the Confederacy as an Army surgeon all through that war , died , at 81 . Incidentally , Dr. Baruch left in his son a reverence for the Constitution as the " greatest charter of any kind . " Mr. Baruch 's denunciation of Hit- , ler as a world menace in 1935 ; and his insistence in 1937 , for an expanded Army because aggressors believed only in force and might . " There was talk , too , of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked the financier if he feared the future of America . " Afraid ? " he queried in a surprised fashion . " I 'm never afraid of the future of America . I have boundless faith in Americans taking care of themselves , if they are told what to do and why . "
