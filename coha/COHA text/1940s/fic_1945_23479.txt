HEAR THE NIGHTINGALE SING A Story CAROLINE GORDON T wAs so dark in the ravine that at first she could not see the horses . Then her eyes grew accustomed to the gloom . She caught a gleam of white through the branches . She worked her way through the thicket and came upon Bess and Old Gray tethered to the ring that had been fixed in the trunk of a big pine . But the mule was not there . She looked at the broken tether . " Where 's Lightning ? " she asked . The horses pressed up to her , nudging at the sack that was slung over her shoulders . She took hold of their halters and led them down the hill to the branch and then up the stream to a place where the hazel bushes grew higher than her head . She let them drink their fill , then left them there , tethered to a little cottonwood , while she went on up the hill to look for the mule . The woods were thin between here and the pike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the road . At the top of the hill she climbed up on a stump to look down on the pike . There was a cloud of dust off in the direction of Gordonsville but she could not see any soldiers moving along the road . She could remember times  --  in the first year of the war , just after all the boys had gone away  --  when she used to walk in the late afternoons up to the top of this hill in thehope that somebody might be passing . There had hardly ever been anybody then . Now there was almost always something moving along the road  --  great lumbering army wagons , regiments of infantry marching , squads of cavalry sweeping by in clouds of dust . There was a rustling in the bushes along the fence . There the mule stood looking at her . He ducked his head when he saw that she was looking at him and moved off quickly . She got down off the stump , clumsily , in her home-made shoes , and went towards him , holding out an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she called in a whisper . He wheeled ; his little hooves clattered against the rails . She turned and walked the other way , holding the nubbin of corn behind her back . When she felt him take hold of it , she whirled and grasped his foretop . The nubbin had fallen to the ground . She stooped and retrieved it and held it before him on her open palm . " Lightning ! " she said . " Lightning ! " She slipped her arms down about his neck and closed her eyes and laid her cheek against his side . A LONG time ago  --  winter before last  --  she used to go down to the stable lot early after breakfast on cold mornings , and , finding Lightning standing in his corner , his breath steaming in the frosty air , she would cry out to Uncle Joe that her little mule was freezing and put her arms about him and bury her face in his shaggy hair . Uncle Joe would laugh , saying that that mule had enough hair to keep both of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Once Tom Ladd had come up behind them without their hearing him . " I do n't believe I 'd have given you that mule if I 'd known how you were going to raise him , " he said . " You ca n't get him back now , " she had told him . " I 'm raising him to be the no ' countest mule in the county . " He laughed . They had walked in silence over the lightly frozen ground up to the house . Tom had what her father called " the gift of silence . " But sometimes , sitting in company , you would look up and find him watching you and it would seem that he had just said something or was about to say something . But what it was she never knew . And it might be that he had never had any particularity for her . It might be that he noticed her more than the other girls only because she had the mule for a pet . He liked all animals . She , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a little girl and Uncle Joe would bring a team in to plough the garden in the spring she would look at the mules standing with their heads hung , their great , dark eyes fixing nothing , and she would think how , like Negroes. they were born into the world for nothing but labor , and her heart would seem to break in her bosom and she would run barefoot down the rows and when Uncle Joe cracked his whip she would clutch his elbow , shrieking , " You , Uncle Joe . Do n't you hit that mule ! " until the old man would leave his team standing , and going to the window where her mother sat sewing , would ask her to please make Miss Barbara come in the house : When she became a young lady it had tickled her fancy to have a mule for a pet . Lightning , nosing unreproved at the kitchen door or walking across the flower beds , seemed somehow to make up for the pangs she had suffered as a child . But even then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still alive and the servants wereall still on the place and you had only to call from the upper gallery to have somebody come and lead him back to the pasture when he trespassed , even then in those days that were so hard to remember now , he had been a trouble and a care . H E WAS old Lightfoot 's colt . Lightfoot had gone blind in her last days . Tom Ladd had turned her over to Jake Robinson to take care of . Jake had taken good care of her but he could not resist the temptation to get one more colt out of her . Tom had some business with her father and had been spending the night at their house . A Negro boy brought word from Jake that Lightfoot had foaled in the night . They were at breakfast . Her mother had just asked her to go to the kitchen to get some hot bread . Tom Ladd said , " Miss Barbara , how 'd you like to have one of Lightfoot 's colts ? " She was so taken aback @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the biscuits and sat down and would have let what he had said pass unnoticed . But he looked at her as she came in and he spoke again . " It 'll be her last colt . " Tom Ladd came to their house two or three times a week . A bed was kept ready for him in the office whenever he cared to spend the night . But he had never danced with her or with her sister and if he sat on the porch with them in the evenings it was to talk with her father about the crops or the stock . Tom Ladd loved horses better than people , her mother said , and he loved liquor better than he loved horses . Her father said that this was because he was a bachelor , living alone in that big house , but her mother said it was in the blood : all the Ladds drank themselves to death . She had felt her color rising , knowing that her mother 's eyes were upon her . But it was no crime to love horses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father sprawling on the cellar steps , a jug in his hand . Shc said , " I 'll have to see the colt first , Mr. Ladd . " Everybody laughed and the moment passed . After breakfast they drove over to Robinsons ' to see the new colt . Jake was sitting on the front steps , mending some harness . He did not quit his work , saying only , " I 'll be out there in a minute , Mr. Tom . " They walked out into the pasture . The mare stood at the far end , beside a willow sink . They could see , under her belly , the long , thin legs and little wobbly feet . " Sorrel , " Tom Ladd said , " Lightfoot always breeds true , " and walked around the mare 's hindquarters and stopped and swore out loud . Her father laughed until he had to put a hand on her shoulder to steady himself . " You never told him not to breed her , " he said , wiping his eyes . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ears as long as his , " Tom Ladd said . The colt stopped sucking and flung his head up and stared at them . His ears were so long that they looked as if they might tip him over . He had eyes as large and dark and mournful as a Negro baby 's . The fawn color about his muzzle gave him the look of a little clown . She put her arms about his furry rump and he kicked feebly , nuzzling against his mother 's side . " Hush , " she said , " you 'll hurt his feelings . " It was a year later that Tom Ladd had given him to her , after Jake Robinson had had to give up trying to break him . N ow she led the mule down the hill . The horses heard them coming and whinnied . She led him up to them , so close that they could touch noses . Then she made a halter out of the broken rope and led the three of them hack to the thicket . The old mare and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pine but Lightning kept sidestepping and shaking his head . She led him off a little way and tied him to another tree and opened the sack and gave Bess and Gray four nubbins apiece and the clover that she had gathered in the orchard . When they had finished eating she tethered them again and mounted Lightning and rode him down the ravine . The sun had set . Here in the thick woods it was dark . But she could see the light from the house , shining through the trees . They did not use the path at all now No use in keeping your horseshidden off in the woods if there was a path leading to them . But it was hard , riding through the underbrush . She had to lie flat on the mule 's back to keep from being scraped off . At the edge of the wood she dismounted and was about to open the gate when a sound down the road made her stop , chain in hand . Somebody was walking along the road , whistling softly . She let the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led Lightning back a little way into the bushes . The sound grew . The man , or whoever it was , walked along steadily , whistling as he came . She pressed close against the mule , her arm over his withers . He stood quietly but the sound of his breathing seemed to fill all the thicket . Light from the house fell in a great fart across the road . A man 's vizored cap and the knapsack that bulged at his shoulder showed black against it for a second and then he passed on . But the sound of his whistling was all around her still . An old tune that she had always known : One morning , one morning , one morning in May I met a fair lady a-wending her way She stood there until the sound had quite died away ; then , lifting the chain with infinite care , she opened the gate and led the mule across the road and into the yard . The front door opened . Her sister stood on the porch . " Barbara ! " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sophy went inside and shut the door . Barbara drew Lightning swiftly through the yard and toward the stable . Halfway there she stopped . The stable would n't do . That was the first place they went . Nor the hen-house , though it was big enough . None of the outbuildings would do . They always searched outbuildings , to make sure they did n't miss anything . They would search an outbuilding when they would n't search the house itself . She turned back into the yard and ran down the cellar steps , the mule lumbering behind her . He came down the last two steps so fast that he ran over her . She felt the impact of his chest between her shoulders and knew that his forefoot had grazed her ankle before she went sprawling down in the dark . She lay there a moment , wondering how badly she was hurt , then got to her feet and felt her way to where he stood . She stroked his neck and talked to him gently . A ray of light struck on the wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lighted lamp in her hand . She peered into the cellar , then came a little way down the steps , holding the lamp high over her head . " Have you gone distracted ? " she asked . " Why do n't you see after the stock ? " Barbara asked coldly . " He 's not hurting your old cellar . " She poured what corn was left in the sack out upon the earthen floor , fastened the cellar doors , and followed Sophy up the steps . H ER twelve-year-old brother sat beside the stove , whittling . He looked up eagerly as she came in . " You going to keep that mule in the cellar , Sister ? You going to keep him in there all the time ? " Barbara sat down in the big chair by the window . She lifted her skirt to examine her leg . Blood was caked on her shin and the flesh of the ankle was bruised and discolored . She felt her lip trembling . She spoke brusquely : " I saw a soldier going past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road . " Sophy did not seem to have heard her . " Why did n't you leave that mule out in the hollow ? " she asked . " He slipped his halter , " Barbara said , " I had to walk all over the woods to find him . " " It would have been a good thing if you could n't find him , " Sophy said . Barbara looked at her steadily . " I 'm going to keep him , " she said , " I do n't care what you say . I 'm going to keep him . " Sophy , compressing her lips , did not answer . Cummy had gone over and sat down at the kitchen table where they always ate nowadays . " Are n't we going to have any supper ? " he asked . Sophy went out on the back porch and returned with two covered dishes . " There 's some black-eyed peas , " she said . " And Mrs. Thomas sent us a pat of butter . I thought we might as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the table , arranging knives and forks and plates . A frail woman of twenty-seven , who looked , Barbara thought suddenly , at least thirty-five . That was because she was just recovering from one of her asthmatic attacks . No , it was because she was so thin . She had never noticed until tonight how sunken her sister 's temples were . And under her cheekbones , where even as a young girl she had had hollows , were deep wells of shadow . " She ca n't stand it , " she thought . " She 's not strong like me . She ca n't stand it . . . . I ought not to keep him . Those nubbins I gave him today . I could have taken them to the mill and had them ground into meal . " " There 's two jars of preserves left , " she said . " A jar of quince and a jar of peach . " Sophy nodded . " Might as well have them now . Preserves are n't any good without buttered bread , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Barbara did not answer . She was looking through the open door into the hall . " Is n't that somebody on the porch ? " she asked . Cummy half rose from his chair . " You sit still , " Barbara said sharply . She got up and went through the hall toward the front door . When she was half way there she stopped . " Who is it ? " she called . T .. door swung slowly open . A man stepped into the hall . A tall , red-faced man in a dark cloak and cavalryman 's boots . He looked at Barbara a moment before he took off his vizored cap . " Good evening , Miss , " he said . " This the way to Gordonsville ? " " Yes , " Barbara said and stepped out on to the porch . " You keep on down this lane till you hit the pike . It is n't more than a quarter of a mile . " The soldier was looking back through the hall into the lighted kitchen . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , smiling a little . Barbara moved past him to the door . She put her hand on the knob . " I 'm sorry but we have n't got a thing . " He thrust his foot swiftly forward just before the door closed . He was laughing . " That 's too bad , " he said and pushed past her into the kitchen . Sophy got up slowly from her chair . Her face had gone dead white . Her mouth was open and then it shut , quivering like a rabbit 's . She was always like that . In a minute she would be crying and telling him it was all right , the way she did last spring when the soldiers took all the meat out of the smokehouse . Barbara thought of that time and her right hand clenched in the folds of her skirt . She put the other hand on Sophy 's shoulder and pointed to the door . " Go on , " she said , " you go on and take Gummy with you . " The soldier had sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards him , he looked up at her , shaking his head a little . " I 'm mighty sorry , " he said , " but I 'm so hungry I could eat a horse . " He laughed . " Horse gave out on me way back up the road . I must have walked ten miles . " Barbara leaned forward until her face was on a level with his . A vein in her forehead stood out , swollen and tinged faintly with purple . She spoke through clenched teeth . " Are n't you ashamed to take the bread out of the mouths of women and children ? " The soldier stared . He seemed about to rise from his chair , but he sank back , shaking his head again , laughing . After a moment he spoke , his mouth full of peas . " Lady , you got any pie ? " " We have n't got anything , " Barbara said . " There is n't anything left on this place worth the taking . It does n't make any difference which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The soldier nodded . A mischievous light came in his eyes , " Those damn Rebs , " he said . " You turn ' em loose on a place and they 'll strip it . " " Do n't you say ' damn Reb ' to mel " Barbara cried . He put his knife and fork down and sat looking at her . His eyes sparkled . " Damn Reb , " he said . " Damn Reb . Damn Reb . . . . If you are n't the feistiest Reb I ever saw ! " He took up his fork . Barbara left the room . Sophy and Cummy were on the front porch . She walked up and down there a few minutes , then went into the deserted parlor and stood before one of the darkened windows , " I wish I could kill him , " she said aloud , " God ! I wish I could kill him . " " Hush ! " came a fierce whisper . " Here he comes . " T HEsoldier stood in the doorway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He lingered , fastening his cloak . He was humming that same tune . One morning , one morning , one morning in May I met a fair lady a-wending her way . . . " Very much obliged , " he said . His eyes sought Barbara 's . She did not answer , staring at Sophy who had moved over and was lighting one of the lamps that stood on the mantel , as if , Barbara thought , they had come in here to entertain a welcome guest . Sophy finished lighting the lamp and sat down on the old love seat , her hands folded in her lap . Cummy had slipped into the room and sat down beside her . On the mantel the lamp burned steadily , revealing objects unfamiliar from long disuse : the walnut chairs , upholstered in faded red , the mute piano , the damask curtains . Their mother had been proud of her parlor when all those things were new . The soldier was looking about him as calmly as if he had been invited to spend the evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corners of his mouth . He walked over to a whatnot in the corner . Dresden figurines were on the top shelf and on the shelf below a hand-painted Japanese fan lay among a pile of Indian arrowheads that Cummy had picked up on the old chipping ground . The soldier took one in his hand . The bits of mica embedded in the flint gleamed as he turned it over slowly . " We get ' em like that on our home place , " he said , and looked into her eyes and smiled . " Up in Indiana . " He laid the arrowhead down and picked up a larger flint . " That 's not for an arrow , " he said . " That 's a sword . A ceremonial sword . My grandfather knew an old Indian once told him what all the different kinds were . " He spoke in a low , casual tone , as if to somebody who stood beside him , somebody who was listening and in a minute would say something back . But there was not anybody here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And the room itself was not used to the sound of human voices . There had not been anybody in it for a long time , not since that night , two years ago , the night of Marie 's wedding , when they had pushed the chairs back and danced till dawn broke at the windows . Gil Lathrop played the fiddle . Sometimes he sang as he played : And the voice that I heard made the valleys all ring It was fairer than the music when the nightingale sings The soldier was humming again . That song , the song they all sang that night , seemed to go on inside him , and now he had to have something to listen to and words rang out in the still room : And f ever I return it will be in the spring For to see the waters flawing , hear the nightingale sing He had a clear tenor voice . At home , among his own people , he would be the one to sing at the gatherings . He picked up the little bright-colored fan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Now which one of you ladies does this belong to ? " For to see the waters flowing , hear the nightingale sing . . ? . But the night of the wedding you could not tell who was singing ; the song was on every lip . " Look ! " Ruth Emory had said . " There 's Tom Ladd. / never saw him at a dance before . " He would have asked me to marry him , but for all their talk . It will be in the spring . No , I will never see him again . There are some men who do not come home from a war . If the music could only have gone on that night . . . The soldier 's eyes were blue , really , not gray . Blue , overlaid with white , like frozen water . There was no song in theroom now . Black pin-points grew in his eyes , glinted as he slowly turned his head . " Now what was that ? " he asked . Barbara whirled and stood with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of her . She thought at first that she had not heard anything , that it was only the blood pounding in her ears . Then it came again , the slow beat  --  beat of the mule 's hoof against the brick wall of the cellar . HE left the window and walked across the room . As she passed the fireplace she pushed the shovel with her foot . It fell to the floor with a clatter , taking the tongs with it . The Yankee picked them up and stood them on the hearth . He looked at her , his eyes grave and speculative . " What was that ? " he asked again . She took a step towards him . " It 's my brother , " she said . " He 's armed . " She took another step . " He 'll shoot you . " The Yankee laughed , cocking his head on one side . " Now what good would it do you to get me shot ? " He walked in his heavy boots out into the hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He lifted the lighted lantern that sat on the table and beckoned to Gummy . " Come here , son . I 've got an errand for you . " Cummy 's face took on its stubborn look . " I do n't want to go down there , " he said . Sophy was crying . " Poor little motherless boy . Do n't make him go . " The Yankee put his arm about Cumrny 's shoulders . " You come along with me , son . Nothing 's going to hurt you . " He opened the door into the cellar and , holding the lantern , leaned over Cummy 's shoulder to look down the stairs . He straightened up , laughing . " That 's a mighty peculiar brother you 've got down there , " he said . He handed the lantern to Gummy . " You hold on to that , son , and do n't get in the way of my right arm . I would n't be surprised if you had another brother down there . " They started down the steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his arm still about Cummy 's shoulder . Barbara watched them until they were halfway down , then she ran out through the back door and around the side of the house . The double cellar doors were still closed when she got there , but she could hear the Yankee fumbling with the bolt . He had pulled it out . The doors slammed back . Lightning came slowly up the steps . She waited until his head and shoulders were level with the ground before she reached up and caught the halter . " This is my mule , " she said . Lightning snorted and tossed his head . The whites of his eyes showed . His ears were laid back . She tugged at the halter again . " You let him go , " she sobbed . " You better let him go ! " The soldier raised his arm and pushed her , so hard that she spun away from him to fall on the grass . He brought Lightning up the last two steps , then came and stood over her while she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her arm . The fingers pressed it for a moment , the firm , hien* , admonitory pressure a man might give your arm  --  at a dance , if there was some secret understanding between you that he wanted to remind you of . " I did n't mean to hurt you , " he said , " but you ought n't to have come interfering . Between us we might have broken that mule 's legs on those steps . " She did not answer , staring past him at the mule where he stood in the wash of light from the window , gazing before him out of great , dark eyes . His coat and his little bristling mane shone red in the light . His nostrils were ringed with palest fawn color . If she went over now and cupped his nose in her hands , the nostrils , snuffing gently in and out , would beat against her palm like butterflies ' wings . She looked up into gray eyes that sparkled in the light . The soldier had a broad mouth that slanted a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just about to stretch into a smile . She looked away , thinking how you could set your thumbs at the corners of those lips and rend the mouth from side to side and then , grasping in your hands the head  --  the head that you had severed from the body  --  you would beat it up and down on the boards of the wellsweep until you cast it , finally , a battered , bloody pulp , into those grassesthat sprang up there beside the well . She walked over and sat down on the wooden platform . The planks were cool and wet . She gripped them hard with both hands . The man was still there , making a throat latch out of a piece of twine . He was turning around . " You have n't got a bridle to spare , Bud ? " Gummy spoke up shrilly . " You better not take that mule . I 'm telling you now . You better not take him . Ca n't anybody do anything with him but Tom Ladd and he 's joined the army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's back and was sitting there looking down at them . " I 'm swapping you a good mare for this mule , " he said . " She gave out on me . ? , about three miles up the road . . " Lightning had stood quiet while the , man mounted but he reared suddenly and plunged forward , his small , wicked head tucked down , his ears flat on his neck . And now he plunged on , turned the corner into the lane and broke into a mad gallop . The soldier 's voice drifted back above the pounding of hooves . " I 'd be glad for you to have her . . . Lying down under a big oak . . . . About three miles up the road . " C UMMY caught hold of Barbara 's arm . " Come on , Sister . Let 's go see if we can find that mare . " Barbara did not move . Gummy waited a moment , then he sat down beside her . " One thing , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lightning 'll rub him off on the branches . " Barbara had been sitting with her head lifted , staring off into the lane . When he began to speak again she raised her hand . " Hush ! " she said sharply and then , " What 's that ? " Gummy jumped to his feet . " It 's that Yankee , " he said . " He 's in trouble . " He bounded across the yard and through the open gate . Barbara followed him . It was black dark in the lane . They could not see their hands before them . There was no sound except the thudding of their own feet and then it came again , the cry which rose and swelled and broke finally into hideous shrieks . Barbara caught up with Cummy and pulled him to the left . " It 's this way , " she panted , " over in the woods . " They crashed through the underbrush and came out in a little glade . They could not see anything at first ; then they made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lightning , stock still under a low hanging bough , his head sharply lifted , his forefeet planted wide apart . The dark mass between his spread legs was too dense for shadow . Curmny was holding on to Barbara 's hand . " Somebody 's coming , " he whispered . Barbara did not look around . " It 's Sis Sophy , " she said . " She 's bringing the lantern . " She stood motionless . The long rays of the lantern flickered across the treetrunk and fell on the soldier 's face , on the place where his eyes had been , on the blood that oozed from the torn mouth on to the dead leaves . Sophy was whimpering softly . The lantern shook in her hand . " We 'll have to bury him . . . . Well have to get somebody to help us bury him . " Barbara 's eyes came away at last from the dead man to rest on Sophy 's face . " I 'm not going to help bury him , " she said . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put her hand up and cupped it over his quivering nostrils . He gave a long sigh and stepped clear of the body . She slid her arm down to rest on his withers . " Come on , " she said . " Let 's go home . " Bloody Ridge  --  Guadalcanal RAYMOND HENRI W flo would note such a field ?
