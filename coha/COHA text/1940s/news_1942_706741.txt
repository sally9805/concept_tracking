txt The breaking up of a diligent but almost entirely fruitless effort to enlist the population of Harlem in a move to upset the United States Government and to help the Japanese establish a world empire for the " dark races " was announced yesterday by United States Attorney Mathias F. Correa . This was accomplished with the indictment of five men , four of whom were arrested immediately , while Federal agents began a search for the fifth . The four who are in custody were arraigned before Federal Judge T. Blake Kennedy , and in varying accents each pleaded not guilty to the charges of conspiracy to violate the wartime sedition statute . Leonard Robert Jordan , president of the Ethiopian Pacific Movement , is a Negro of West Indian birth . He looks like a very dark Japanese . His speech was clipped . Lester Eugene Holness , secretary of the organization , is taller , with long , shiny black hair and a small mustache . He spoke softly , almost as if abashed . Joseph Hartley , the only white person in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green suit , snapped out his words belligerently . He enlisted in the Army last week and although he was inducted on Saturday he was promptly brought back from Fort Dix , N. J. , for arraignment here . He has worked as a cafeteria employe and is described as an old // SEDITION CHARGED TO FIVE IN HARLEM // Christian Front member and follower of Joseph E. of the Christian Mobilizers . The " Rev. " Ralph Green Best , a rather short man with a sprinkling of gray in his short kinky I hair , spoke with composed mildness . He is the one who used to lead the tiny audiences that would listen to him and the others in prayer , and follow that up with tirades against the United States and in favor of the Axis . James Henry Thornhill , who was not further identified , except as a speaker at the group 's exercises , was the missing defendant . Their Efforts Futile Mr. Correa and John F. Sonnett , his executive assistant , emphasized that the florid and handsome promises made by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the conspirators wished . While Jordan and the others were exhorting crowds of 200 or fewer to rise up and join their Japanese " friends , " they made so many enemies among the Negro population that there will be plenty of witnesses to testify against them at their trial . " The colored people have been as quick as any group within our population to repudiate all efforts to win them over to the Axis line by propaganda , " Mr. Correa said . " Responsible leaders have expressed the indignation of all loyal Negro citizens at this attempt to identify Jap propaganda with the legitimate campaign against racial discrimination . " They have repeatedly urged that the seditious acts of this group be brought to a halt by prosecution . " Harlem Editors ' Views Expressions of this same attitude were made yesterday by the editors of three publications serving the Harlem district . P. M. H. Savory , editor of The Amsterdam News , said : " Any individual , irrespective of race or creed , who cooperates with the Axis powers is an enemy of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to law . " Every thoughtful Negro is supporting our government in its efforts to protect our country in this critical hour . " William E. Clark , city editor of The New York Age , remarked that the question of race did not enter into this case , and added : " Negroes expect no different treatment from any other race or group when they come before the court . All they want is the same treatment as other racial groups are getting . " The Rev. A. Clayton Powell , City Councilman and editor of The People 's Voice , said : " I am unalterably opposed to any Negro or group of Negroes that seek to find a solution to our problems by doing business with Hitler &; Co . It is important to distinguish between Negroes who are fighting for their rights and Negroes who are fighting for the Axis . " Some of the Promises According to the indictment , Jordan and his associates tried to instill in their hearers simple and complete faith in the good-will of the Japanese toward them . Assuring them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could set up 20,000,000 American Negroes as masters of Africa , the conspirators , according to Mr. Correa , then said : " We are going to knock out Pearl Harbor again , and after we then we are coming into Arizona , coming into Vera Cruz , Mexico , and then we are coming into Arizona , and if you are on the wrong side * * * there will be no money for you . " Japan is going to liberate the dark races , and all intelligent people should realize now that the battle Japan is fighting against the Western Powers is the battle of Africa , the battle of Asia , the battle of the dark man here , in Central America and West Indies . " One of the conspirators , who was not named , was quoted in the indictment as saying : " If the United States or the British Government should draft me to fight against the Germans or the Japanese ' would wave my handkerchief as a , - sign of surrender and go over to join the Axis Powers , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jordan is a British subject , who deserted from the British navy during the last war , according to Mr. Sonnett . He was born in Kingston , Jamaica , 42 years ago , and entered this country in 1920 by jumping ship , in violation of the immigration rules . He served as quartermaster on the Japanese ship Singapore Maru . Recently he was convicted and sentenced to thirty days in jail for a minor infraction of the alien registration law . Movement Viewed as Racket As described by Mr. Correa yesterday , the operation of Jordan 's branch of the Ethiopian Pacific Movement seemed to be in the nature of a racket preying on a very small number of Harlem 's most gullible residents . In this aspect of the case Mr. Correa stressed the following quotation from a speech of one of the conspirators : will break up any system of the so-called white government a million times . . . I will fight for Japan with every drop of my blood , and I would n't ask a penny , for I realize that when the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not as an inferior , but looked upon as an equal man of the Japanese people and the dark people in the world . " Recently , however , the arrest of another agitator by Federal Bureau of Investigation agents showed that the so-called Pacific movement hag other branches . This other man was Mimo D. Guzman , a Filipino who has spent ten years trying to get members for a militant organization that would link the " dark races " of the world . A few weeks ago , when a reporter called on Holness to ask him about Guzman , the secretary and cashier of Jordan 's outfit said : " He must be with the Eastern Division . " Then he refused to say any more . Judge Kennedy set bail for each of the four arraigned yesterday at $5,000 and put the case over for further hearing today . At that time , Jordan said , their counsel , Vernal Williams , would be with them . The penalty for conviction on the charges they face can be twenty years in prison and a fine of $10,000. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
