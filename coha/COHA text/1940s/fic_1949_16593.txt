1 EXT . FRONT STREET - NIGHT FADE IN LONG ELEVATED SHOT of Third Street , a bleak , tawdry strip of commerce end amusement on the waterfront , heart of Paradise City 's Skid Row . It is dimly illuminated except for an are of light about the Paradise Arena , which dominates the scene . The arena ( seating capacity 2500 ) is a cheaply constructed , box-like wooden building , some twenty years old , dirty gray , that apparently has not received a coat of paint since it was built . Four or five floodlights over the entrance cast a harsh light . There are two box-office windows in front , one marked " Gallery " and the other " Reserved . " On the facade in faded le ttering is the legend : PARADISE CITY A. C. BOXING WEDNESDAYS  --  WRESTLING FRIDAYS On its right , separated by a narrow alley , is Danceland , a cheap dance hall . On the same side of the street , we can distinguish such places as a shooting gallery , a Chinese restaurant , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ringside Cafe .

As CAMERA MOVES IN on scene , HOLD for a second ON a clock outside a pawn shop , ESTABLISHING TIME as 8:50 P.M. A raucous TUNE from the Danceland competes with SOUNDS of the street : automobiles , crowd noises and SHOUTS of two news vendors . Ten or fifteen people are milling about in front of the arene , talking , smoking , impatiently looking up and down the street . Four or five men are lined up at a box office window buying tickets .  --  2  --  CAMERA TRUCKS UP ON a man in his forties , ears gnarled , nose bashed in , a locomotor ataxia hobble  --  he is obviously an ex-pug  --  who stands near the entrance with an armload of boxing weeklies .

The big man turns around and we see his face for the first time : there is a frightening stare in his eyes . As they move away from camera the smell man guides him to the arena entrance and the tapping of his white cane on the pavement tells us that he is blind .

He is a gross character , sloppy and seedy in his cheap sports coat . At Tiny 's side , waiting for him to light his cigar , is RED Stoker 's trainer . Red is a mousy , worried little man in middle fifties . He is billiard-bald . &nbsp; TINY ( trying to make the cigar draw ) Where 's ...

Red joins a group clustered about an amusement " skill " machine of the " Erie Digger " type . Behind glass-enclosed front is a variety of prizes ranging from watches , cameras and binoculars to almost worthless paper favors , all of which are embedded in colored balls of gum candy . A miniature steam-shovel claw suspended by a series of small pulleys and wires and partially guided horizontally and vartically by two levers on the outside of the machine , is being steered by a lush as an audience of eight or nine watches intently .

PANNING WITH Tiny as he inspects them , we see two or three amorous couples in various stages of inoffensive love-making ; a bum who has passed out ; a truculent couple arguing and gesticulating but we do not hear them .  --  7  --  On the same side is a juke box playing a loud polka . As Tiny passes through , we hear ad lib lines from the Skid Rogues at the bar : " Put a head on it ! " " No .. no .. We win the first round .... you win the second . " " What 's her number ?

Tiny grabs a hendful of poteto chips from bowl on bar end stuffs them into his mouth . &nbsp; TINY ( confidentially , close to Danny ) Everything 's taken care of .

Tiny offers his hand across the table . &nbsp; TINYIt 's getting late ... I got to blow . 10 CLOSEUP as Danny hesitates , then shakes Tiny 's hand . Danny holds it in a firm grip , Tiny cringing under his steely gaze . When Dan finally unloosens his hand from the vise , we see several bills in Tiny 's palm . Tiny looks down , to confirm their denomination . &nbsp; DANNY ( angrily ) It 's all there ... fifty . 11 CLOSEUP Tiny . He looks up at Danny for a moment , thumbs through the bills and nods his head . Tiny then stuffs the bills in a pocket of his coat , rises and leaves the booth with a slight hand wave .

It is 8:56 P.M. CAMERA PANS AROUND to Stoker . He awakens with a start , a trace of terror in his eyes . As he bacomes conscious of his surroundings he stands up , stretches , rubs the sleep out of his eyes and fondles his right hand , knotted in a fist .

The buildings  --  49  --  are ramshackle , housing the usual assortment of 25-cent flophouses , cafeterias and beer joints . As she passes in front of an old , dimly-lit building , above which is a sign , RESCUE MISSION  --  WELCOME . an Organ is HEARD faintly from inside , accompanying a broken-down hymn .

He is relaxed , impassive . He is loaning back on his stool , his legs sprawled out , his arms resting on the ring ropes behind him .
