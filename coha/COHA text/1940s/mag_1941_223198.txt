One noon hour last week two slim , trim , pretty girls , with yellow hair and peach- &-cream; skin , met in the cafeteria on the roof of Washington 's new Social Security Building , lunched together for the first time . <P> One girl was North Dakota-born Lucille Henricks , 23 , secretary to Donald Marr Nelson . <P> The other was Montana-born Helen Madden , 30 , secretary to Leon Henderson . The well-complected girls became friends over the telephone long ago in the constant crisscross of Nelson-Henderson calls . They had reason to decide to get acquainted , as they sat in the green-leather- &-chromium; lounge , munched cream cheese and veal sandwiches . They were destined for greater collaboration , like their bosses , who had become , by Presidential order on the night before , the key men in U.S. defense management . <P> When Lucille and Helen read their papers that morning they felt , as did many another painfully harassed U.S. citizen , that perhaps the U.S. had at last won a great battle at home-a prime requisite to winning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At long last the President had moved decisively , whipping the vast sprawl of defense management into its first clear sense-making shape , dominated by an authoritative body called SPAB-Supply Priorities &; Allocations Board . For the first time the President had delegated real authority , although he still jealously reserved his final say . On the 15-month anniversary of Defense he had at last accepted a way to get everything done that must be done . <P> Judicious Judge Samuel Irving Rosenman ( TIME , Sept. 1 ) had devised the scheme . His orders from the President were to survey the entire program , to suggest a reorganization which would settle the increasingly louder bickering . " Sammy the Rose , " who believes in the efficiency of simpleness , began by calling on all defense chiefs . After a day of calls he would return to his quiet , comfortable White House room , knit his judicial brow , write down the problems to be solved . <P> Next step was to confer , confer , confer . He saw nearly everyone even remotely connected with defense management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tips , plain and fruity gossip . His regulated mind coldly assayed strengths and frailties , measured promise against performance . Night after night he trotted back to the calm of the White House , puzzled over his notes ; through whole days read books , articles , memoranda . He tried to weigh objectives , ponder human values , disregard individual personalities . Finally he drew his conclusions , drafted three plans basically similar . <P> Judge Rosenman then took his plans back to the defense bosses . So thorough had been his thinking , so deeply prepared were his answers to any objections , there was not a single dissent . <P> The President returned , brooded over the plans . As always he was reluctant to move , to hurt the feelings of incompetents who must be shuffled out of the way . But the pressure of public opinion was on him crushingly ; and the demands for a speedup in U.S. production now circled the world , from Britain through Russia to China . He had a personal reason too : he was heartily sick of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desk . He decided to sign , and gave to his intimates word that he wanted all the quarrels moved into Henry 's room .
