Liberal U. S. Catholics , who do not mind joking ( among themselves ) about some aspects of their Church , have a gag to the effect that the next great saint in the calendar will be St. Bingo . Although church games have been forbidden by certain bishops and archbishops ( latest : Boston 's William Henry Cardinal O'Connell ) , Bingo has been the material salvation of many a poor Catholic parish . The Catholic excuse for Bingo is that , lying within the fairly broad limits of non-sinful gaming , it furnishes recreation for honest people . But the game is a headache to many a U. S. judge and policeman . Last week the Wisconsin Supreme Court declared that Bingo is a form of lottery , hence illegal . A Bingo test case was scheduled for trial in Buffalo . In Cincinnati , Police Chief Eugene T. Weatherly last week issued an eminently readable report on Bingo in Cincinnati during the past year . <P> Last summer Cincinnati 's Protestant leaders demanded that Bingo be outlawed . Catholics , backed by ruddy , white-crested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The city council compromised by requiring police authorization of Bingo parties , limiting prizes to 25% of the gate , with a maximum of $100 a prize ( prizes had gone as high as $1,000 ) . But even under these restrictions , Bingo packed them in . Nearly 2,500,000 players paid nearly $2,000,000 at 2,289 parties during the year , ran up a profit of about $1,500,000 for 30-odd Catholic churches and a scattering of secular societies ( such as the United Negro Improvement Association , the Military Order of Lizards ) . Just one Protestant church , St. Paul 's Lutheran , tried Bingo , gave up after netting $27 at one party . Biggest Catholic take : $219,913.91 ( gross ) from one party a week at St. Augustine 's Church , in one of Cincinnati 's poorer sections .
