16 DUDE BEEF By NEIL M. CLARK H IS clothes looked right . So did he . High-heeled boots , range riding suit of dusty brown with top pockets , big brown sombrero . He was thin-waisted like a cowboy , broad-shouldered , tanned . In the lobby of Tucson 's Santa Rita Hotel he appeared to be a well-to-do cattleman just in from desert pastures . And yet , perhaps because he fitted the part a mite too well , something set him apart . " Dude ? " I said to old Charley , greasy-sack cow operator who until recently spent nine tenths of his working life in the saddle . " Of course he 's a dude ! " he snorted . " You can smell ' em a mile . " Old Charley just barely tolerates dudes . The rather illogical reason is that he sold out to one . Sold ranch , cattle , almost his reason fur existence . As a result of the deal , he has an unexpected stack of dollars in the bank and nothing to do . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canyons that were as familiar to him as the back of his hand , blizzards and sunshine on the ridges , outlaw steers , roundup fires , horses he used to ride  --  and now he just twiddles his thumbs in town . Beef , as everyone knows , is bullets in this war . Those nations having the most good beef to fortify soldiers and civilians will undoubtedly win . That fact gives pointed significance to a back-to-the-land movement which has been gaining in tempo at a great rate in the last ten years . Signs of it may be seen all over the West , b it it has gone furthest and fastest in the Southwest , in Texas , New Mexico , and especially Arizona . Dozens of cattle ranches have passed out of the hands of experienced owners , and have gone to men from the cities who shoot the moon when they see a spread they like , but never met a cow as an equal until the day before yesterday . Already dude owners control millions of acres on which tens of millions of pounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always been the West 's banker . But this is different . Money in big chunks has been going to buy , not finance , cattle ranches , and in many cases the men who own the money are coming with it . They build homes , live on their ranches , help in the actual roping , branding , driving , cutting out , breeding and feeding . Dude ranchers are men or women who have inherited money or made it in something besides cattle . Sometimes they run to movie-set haciendas , with swimming pools , riding stables , patios , elaborate landscaping effects and other comforts and luxuries , Today , dozens of dude mansions dot the country between Tucson and the Mexican border , and elsewhere too . Go and visit Frank Cowlishaw 's little place , for example . Until a dozen years ago , Cowlishaw was the furniture man for Macy 's of New York . He built the department up till it was doing ten or twelve millions a year . Mrs. Cowlishaw was manager of a department in the same store . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their farthest West . In November , 1931 , under protest , they took a vacation trip to Arizona . Within a week they were in love with the mountains and desert . Within two weeks they knew that a heifer was a she calf . Within three weeks they had bought 35,000 acres of landscape and hired a dude wrangler from the guest ranch as manager . That 's how the madness can strike . The Cowlishaws quit New York and have hardly been back since . And they built a house . For years they had lived where space was measured in inches . When they came to the great open spaces , it seemed as if they could n't roof in enough of it . The house has fifteen rooms , some of them as big as many modest homes . There are two dining rooms , seven screened or terraced porches , no end of bathrooms , powder rooms , halls and closets . Frank Cowlishaw 's clothes closet ought to be given in person to Fibber McGee ; it is // nine feet wide , twenty-seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They run 1000 head or so and make a lot of beef . The Jeffcotts also built in that part of Arizona . R. C. Jeffcott was an executive of American Cyanamid , among other things . Most of his spare time was spent on boats . He hardly knew Southern Arizona existed until his son , Dave , went there for his health , loved it , and bought a ranch  --  the old Rail X. The news of Dave 's intention reached Jeffcott , senior , aboard the yacht , Dauntless . He cabled for somebody to stop the lad before he was swindled . An agent came , investigated , reported maybe the boy was n't being swindled after all . Later , Jeffcott came to see for himself , and he , too , fell in love with blue skies , mountains , inimitable sunsets , sunrises and space , and presently was buying another ranch and a herd of his own ? " To show that kid of mine how to make money with cows . " He built a house . Just a cowman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountain and about as indestructible . Neighbors say Hitler 's artillery and an earthquake combined could n't knock it to pieces . It 's built of fitted stones , no mortar . The same firm that installed Mexican tile work in the Los Angeles Union Station was hired to install similar tile in Jeffcott 's house , and it took them longer to do the house than the station . There 's a swimming pool , of course . Windows in the enormous living room are of solid plate glass , mounted so they can be rolled back and the swimming pool become part of the living room . Super-ranch houses are visible evidence of the coming of the dudes , and they 're all new . Jim Pendleton has been running the Baca Float Ranch , near Nogales , for just fifteen years . He 's a dude , too , or the brother of one . Tol Pendleton , the brother , was an all-American in 1910 and captain of the Princeton eleven in 1913 , also an ace in World War I. Having made a pile of money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy the 100,000-acre Baca Float Spanish Grant , and sent Jim to manage it for him . " When I came , " says Jim , " there was n't a bathroom between Nogales and Tucson  --  well , maybe there was one . There were no good roads , telephones , bu-gas systems , electric-light systems . The houses were dobe shacks . " Today , taking that paved and popular road , you do n't wonder whether anybody has bathrooms , but how many there are in each house . Some are reported to have fourteen . Dudes invaded the Tucson area first and heaviest . Not all of them build palace 's . One lives in an old dobe house , slightly modernized , which was formerly the foreman 's . A woman dude refused to put up a big house , saying she did n't know how soon , thanks to war , she 'd have to do her own housework . But the tendency has been to build spaciously , to move Hollywood luxury to the desert , to spare no cost . Naturally , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the business for years and know its margins . A few of the dudes care nothing whatever for cows . There is the story of one wealthy man who sent his secretary out to buy his ranch , and she oversaw the building of the ranch house . On the movie-set order , it was . When it was finished , the new owner came to take a look . A special train brought him and his guests . He held the train for several days , because he thought he might want to leave any minute . Finally , he sent the train away . Then , on about the tenth day , he got a bump on his knee , He concluded he would be better off in the East . He left and has n't been back . PHOTOGRAPHY BY CHUCK ABBOTT In the main , however , the newcomers mean to make a success of ranch operations , and they do produce a lot of good beef . Typical is Freddy Patterson , whose 154-section Willow Springs Ranch near Oracle , Arizona , supports about 2500 cows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Freddy was n't born in any cow corral . Bankers back East know him as Frederick B. Patterson . His father was John H. Patterson , founder of the National Cash Register Company . Until eight years ago , Fred himself was president of that globe-girdling corporation . Cows were just steaks . But now he 's an old dude cowman . " I did n't come out here , " he told me , " merely to enjoy the mountains and the climate . I came to make money , and moved everything I own . I 'd better make money from my ranch , too , for it 's what I live on . " " Have you made money on it ? " I asked . He hedged . " It depends on how you figure . I think of the ranch more as a long-time investment . If you mean , could I get out what I 've put in  --  yes , I could . " Like many of the businessman dudes , Patterson knows his ranch costs to a penny , with the help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along with a checkbook and a good memory . A cost system is no substitute for a good eye for beef , and Patterson says he was taken for thousands of dollars when he started , because he did n't know cattle . But he has learned a lot in ten years , and is proud of the fact that he can do any job on the ranch except roping . " You have to start roping chickens the day after you 're born , to be a good call roper , " he says . He likes to have it known that he rides the spring and fall roundups , sleeps in a roll for five weeks at a stretch , eats at the chuck truck . He especially likes to have it known that he has put a lot of money into developments  --  particularly water  --  that enable him to weather serious droughts and make a maximum amount of beef , year in and year out . Therein lies a major benefit of the dude invasion  --  the range and herd improvements they make . They have ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bang-up job . ( Continued an Fogs 70 ) THE SATURDAY ( Continued from Pogo 68 ) his instincts were correct . There ought to be some flaming words to give high purpose and fine meaning to these ships and all these men who freely put their mutilation and their lives at risk . Words of fire , they ought to be . Deathless words to live forever in the memory of free men everywhere , enduring after all these ramparts crumbled into dust . So Brakley looked around him while the daylight strongly grew . The gaunt gray ships of war were clear now on the vast and white-flecked ocean space . They DUDE BEEF ( Continued from Poge 17 ) Their use of ready cash does n't always please established cowmen . Often it ups land prices and wage scales . But a good deal of it goes into improvements of the kind which , if judiciously handled , in the long run mean more and better beef . Many old-timers never had long enough pocketbooks to do things they knew should be done . Some were so hard-pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chances for long-time gains . Methods of land tenure formerly tended to encourage this and discouraged extensive improvements . That 's changed now , and dudes with bottomless pocketbooks have , for example , built hundreds of miles of fences . Some of these fences are unnecessarily good , costing as much as four or five hundred dollars a mile when the wire for a standard four-wire range fence averages about sixty-five dollars a mile . A Texas dude bulging with oil millions decided to have a fence that , by jukes , was a fence , and put a reinforced concrete wall around the whole ranch . But even costly fences do a job . They keep scrub hulls out of pastures where purebred breeding cows are trying to create a strain of heavier , better beef critters ; they control grazing , so there are reserves of feed when needed ; they simplify roundups and handling . Dudes have developed a lot of new range waterings too  --  windmills and dirt tanks , mostly  --  and often improve thirsty pastures by water spreading . When Patterson bought his ranch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are twenty-nine . This means  --  he hopescorrectly  --  that feed is more evenly used without overuse ; in the long run , that means more beef . There are occasional extravagances , as when a dude installed a pump to pump water 1000 feet uphill , so cows would graze three or four sections far from water . " Every drink costs them cows a dollar , " says a neighbor . Barns need n't be as elaborate in the Southwest as on Eastern farms , but one dude built a barn at a small fortune , that can he seen for forty miles . Neighbors say he built it to have a loft for dances . On the whole , dudes go in for high-grade cattle  --  pedigreed bulls and high-type cows  --  making for heavier calves and more and better beef . W. E. Holland , Philco executive and dude owner of Rancho Sacatal , at Paul Spur , Arizona , bought Anxiety Mixer , high-selling hull at the Denver show a year ago , paying $7000 for him . Holland already owned several other blue bloods . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but they have cash that talks when the best is up for sale . Dudes generally favor the best modern range-management practices . Fewer animals , for instance . Less crowding . Paradoxically , this often makes more beef , for there 's more feed for the animals that are left , better-fed breeding cows drop more calves , and the calves are heavier . One big New Mexico outfit  --  not a dude spread ? in an eight-year period averaged 2,158,180 pounds of beef per year with 18,819 breeding cows , but later the same EVENING POST could be seen in all their majesty , signal halyards full , white foam eager at their eyes as they went plunging south and west to the place where battle was to join . Deep pride touched John Brakley then . He stood erect , remembering from where this glory came . He recalled its continuity . It stemmed from Mahan , Farragut and Jones . From Admiral Mahan , who told Brakley often at the War College that he could remember plainly , in his youth , how his grandfather spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before , with General Washington . outfit , with better range management , averaged 2,506,685 pounds with only 6190 cows . When the Weeks , formerly from the East , bought their big Yolo Ranch , it was carrying from seven to twelve thousand cows . On good advice they reduced the number to about 5000 and are making more beef . No dude , be he as smart as two-tailed lightning , learns ranching in a hurry . There 's too much to it . It requires not only business acumen but also technical knowledge . Only an eye trained long and well can size up a bawling steer and tell what kind of eating he 'll make ; appraise exactly the condition of a range ; recognize which plants are nutritious and which are dangerous ; diagnose the illnesses of sick animals and treat them ; know the signs of predators and what to do about them ; understand markets , price periodicity , public eating habits ; be familiar with the Mendelian law and able to apply it to make better beef ; know what a hired hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what makes a good neighbor . Such things , to the cowman born , are taken in through the pores with daily study and practice for years . They ca n't be summoned to the dude 's service by a wand . Jun* 16,1941 That . close ? That close ! Claude had joined an honored band . So John Bra kley closed his fist upon Fi crumpled slip of paper in the pocket of his greatcoat . He still held it fast . He would never let it go . And that way he raised his head , tipped a little on one side in an old familiar posture . " Yes , Mr , , Snellyr " said the admiral , looking aloft to where the scud flew . " You may make a signal to the fleet . Fly , ' We sail in splendid company . The decision will be final . ' " And John Claude Brakley added , just for Nora 's sake , " ' Good luck . ' " The newcomers try to hire good foremen and managers . A good many employ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phoenix , run by former university men like Wayne Akin and Dr. E. D. Scott , who know the cattle business from grass roots to black ink and are interested in just one thing : to make more and better beef , so they and their clients can profit . Most dudes try to learn the business , and do so to some extent , but very few start at rock bottom and learn all the steps . Sam Bell is an exception . Sam 's father is a Chicago miller and Pullman Company director . After Yale , Sam thought he 'd like to be a sculptor . It did n't work out . Ranching appealed to him . He went to Arizona to buy a ranch . Wayne Akin took him in tow . Sam did n't know which end of a cow was front , but they looked at dozens of ranches , hundreds of cows , and all that sunshine . Sam could n't make up his mind . " Sam , " said Akin , " you do n't know anything about cows . Why do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take you for a cleaning . " " I like it . " " Then learn something about it first . " With that bee in his bonnet , Sam went back to Chicago . Presently he was telephoning to ask Akin if they could n't take him into the company and teach him the facts of life about cows . Maybe , said Akin , joshing , if he was willing to pay $300 a month or so for the privilege . Next thing they knew , there was Sam with the money in his hand . The tuition seemed a little steep , he said , but he was willing . The stall was called and something had to be done . So he was put to work , without pay and without paying , for thirty days . " By then , " said Akin , " we 'll know each other better . " Sam 's first assignment was to accompany one of the men on a hard-riding round of ranches . They took bedrolls , slept on rocks , often rose at two in the morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One of his jobs was cleaning out a corral . He was kept at it for five days , shoveling dung . He never squawked . So it was decided to put him on the pay roll , at thirty dollars a month . Once his father summoned him hack to Chicago and tried to give him a Minnesota farm if he 'd run it . Sam refused . He had a job in Arizona , he said , and had to hurry back to it . " Give Sam Bell another year , " says Akin , " and he 'll make a hand . He 'll even be fit to own a ranch . His wife is as game as he is . He 's one dude I 've known who was willing to start at absolute bottom and learn his stuff . When he 's an owner , I bet he 'll make a go of it . " Why do dudes take up ranching ? Some like the romance of it . Climate and landscape are contributing factors . Desire for security is another reason . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tape and Government control of business have been factors in uprooting many Eastern men and bringing them to the West . A good many wealthy men coolheadedly feel that the range-cattle business is as sound a long-time investment as anything they can put their money into at present . Conditions of land tenure have changed for the better , making ranching in its basic investment factor much sounder . In the East , nearly every foot of land is privately owned . But in the Southwest it 's different . On a ranch holding of 150 square miles-96,000 acres  --  the owner may actually own only eight or ten sections ; the balance is leased from the Government . But in recent years tenure has been made reasonably secure by Government action  --  so that now the rancher can feel that it is worth while to put in improvements . Through Western Eyes Do dudes fit well into their new surroundings ? That 's all according to individual character . Men of the West have always known how to size up people they had to live with , and accept them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They got along with English lords and dukes long before the present influx . Playboy dudes get a cool reception ; old-timers do n't like the type . Dudes who seriously try to fit in and make a go of it are accepted in the cattlemen 's associations and other activities on an equal footing . Dudes , of course , introduce new social twists . Old Charley , in his days on the range , lived spaciously enough for most folks , with all outdoors to spit in , and there was always coffee in the pot , stew in the pan , and a welcome for any passing rider . True , he did n't try to roof in the whole state . He ate with the boys , and nobody now can make him feel at home in some of these new ranch dining rooms with service like that on the Gold Coast . Yet he feels it when he comes to call , and a servant asks him to wait half an hour or so till the owner finishes eating . Different days , different ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nobody knows . Since they have been coming in greatest numbers , cattlemen generally have been on Easy Street , with cattle priced in double numerals much of the time . When calves are again selling for four or five cents , as they have in the past , will the dudes stick ? " No , " guesses one cattleman ; " most of them will tire of their ranches and go back home . Real cattlemen will inherit the improvements they have bought and paid for , and the country will be richer for the improved strains of cattle . A few will stick . Very few . " Henry Boice , one of Arizona 's ablest cattlemen , ventured the thought , as a guess , not a promise , that dudes might have a slight stabilizing effect in bad times by being financially able to hold on to their cattle instead of dumping them to meet mortgages . Gold-Plated Ranching Can the cow business support dudes without other income ? That 's a question . A lot of them have two strikes against them from the start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also because of the prices they pay for their ranches and the sums they put into improvements . Old-time cowmen are n't talking through their hats when they discuss the financial limits and possibilities of the cow business . They insist there 's a point below which , and a point above which , the investment ca n't go . Not long ago , old Charley was bored , and decided he 'd get back into the business . But he could n't Sod a place he 'd have at the prices asked . One of his old friends offered to sell . " How much ? " said Charley . " Twenty thousand . " Charley did a fast mental calculation , and gagged . The place consisted of a quarter-section of patented land , a few run-down buildings , and enough forest land to run 100 cattle . " If I gave you five thousand , the condition your place is in , " he said , " you 'd be overpaid . " " Sure , but I 'll get twenty thousand . " Those who know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fred Patterson wanted an adjoining property at $800 per section  --  a fair price . While he was dickering , a dude came along and paid $3000 for it . In the case of old Charley , what he was figuring on was economic facts . He realized that at $20,000 , he 'd he paying $200 per cow , just for a place to run cows . One of the most careful studies ever made indicates that in these times , if an owner has an investment of less than $100 per cow , he has too little  --  probably he has n't enough improvements to make a go of it  --  but if he has more than $150 , including the cow herself , he has too much . These figures are recognized by **29;1983;TOOLONG men and practical ranchers . With their lavish outlays , many dudes have as much as $400 per cow invested at the outset . Clarence Budington Reiland , the famous author , who is hardly dry behind the ears yet as part owner , with Bruce Barton and Jack Wheeler , of a 50,000-acre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , " Dudes are certainly complicating the situation with us old cowmen . " They are producing a lot of pounds of good red beef , but they are also upsetting a lot of applecarts . What is the considered attitude of the ablest of the experienced old-timers ? Here is one answer . It comes from a man who is president of his state livestock association and has been for ten years , and who has also lent hundreds of thousands of dollars to livestock producers in the Southwest . " Livestock , " he says , " is our basic industry . We can always use the right kind of capital for development and improvement . We like dude capital as well as any , if it 's production capital and well managed . What we mean to fight in our ( Coolinood an Page 73 ) ( Continued from Page 71 ) asseciatinns , and with every possible weapon , is irresponsible dude capital that upsets values willfully or ignorantly , and makes it difficult for responsible , corn , petent cowmen to produce beef permanently with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern standards of living BROTHER , CAN YOU SPARE A LOCOMOTIVE ? ( Continued From Page 26 ) An old-timer at the throttle , Hack can show you how to do it . Take that lunchroom setup at Emigrant Gap , where more than 100 train crews stop to eat every twenty-four hours while their locomotives take on water . Instead of one hash house , the Old Man built two , close to the tracks and spaced more than half a mile apart at the sites where the engines , both pullers and pushers , brake to a stop . Any hour , day or night , the trainmen can fall out of their cabs and onto the stools with food and coffee waiting on the counter . With a pencil and paper , Bill Hack can show you how the steps and time saved amount to twenty minutes a day per engine . For forty-eight AC 's on the run over The Hill that adds up to two thirds of an engine that otherwise would n't exist . " An engine saved is an engine made , " gloated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over The Hill , these babies never cool off . We call ' em for another run before they 're down off the mountain . " Two years ago , at the end of a ball-o ' - fire run like the 274-mile round trip over the Sierra , a locomotive was entitled to a six to eight hour checkup and servicing in the roundhouse at Roseville . But not any more . The Old Man 's turning engines in an hour at both ends of the run . To his way of figuring , the saving in time is just like picking up six to eight AC 's , which , priorities being what they are , ca n't be bought . All you can do is stretch them . There 's more than one way to do that . As recently as 1939 , every locomotive-repair shop from Houston to Portland had it ' - garden , sometimes known as the bone yard . There were a dozen of these altogether , and each was crowded with cold , rusting locomotives awaiting either overhauling or the acetylene torch that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a tradition gone with the war . " Moses had us by the hand , " says President Mercier , explaining what happened . The Espee 's Moses was a former president , the late Angus D. McDonald , who sensed , long before the war clouds darkened , that in a not far distant day the meandering Southern Pacific would become the military belt line connecting the several score Army camps and naval bases of the then-undreamed-of Western Combat Zone . He and Mercier , who was McDonald 's chief aide , acting on the hunch , ordered the shops to hire men and put back into service every old engine whose boiler would hold steam . New Life for Iron Horses Scouring the sidings from El Paso to Portland , Ben Brown , general superintendent of motive power for the Southern Pacific Lines , rounded up 179 old-timers . In the hone yards of the Texas &; New Orleans , which is the Espee of Texas , John Power found two dozen more . On the S. P. of Mexico , Stan Houston , who is Brown 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hauled them over the border . By the end of 1942 , every old teakettle still on wheels was back in service on when they are managed competently by men who have taken the trouble and devoted the time to learning . But irresponsible dudes with too much money can be as disruptive in the cattle business as a bunch of cowmen would be if they suddenly struck oil and spent their billions buying up General Motors at a price twenty points above the market branch lines and in switch yards , releasing more powerful engines for main-line duty . On the railroad 's scattered branch lines today you see engines of many insignia : D.M. &I.R.'s; leased from the Duluth , Missabe &; Iron Range Railway ; Burlingtons ; Chicago &; North Westerns ; Texas &; Pacifies ; Northern Pacifies ; Great Northerns ; Northwestern Pacifies ; even U. S. A. military engines built for foreign service or defense-plant service and borrowed from the Army on a day-to-day basis until they 're needed more urgently elsewhere . " When you 're up against the gun for power , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' and you take what you can get , " said Brown . " We may yet put old Number One back in service . " Old No. 1 is the Collis P. Huntington , a two-driver red-and-gilt job , embedded in the concrete in front of the station at Sacramento , where the first of the Espee 's 14,000 miles of track was laid in 1863 . No. 1 came around the Horn on a sailing ship , but she 'd still run if Brown chipped her wheels out of the cement and if he could find a fireman who could remember how to stoke a wood burner . Down in Houston , John Power , as Irish as railroaders come and filled with an Irishman 's love of locomotives , sat in an office overlooking the railroad yards . Below his window passed everything that chugged through the yard . Suddenly he exploded , without looking up from his desk , " That little engine should n't be pulling that long train . " Outside , a wheezy six-wheeler , revived from some bone yard , was tugging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighting the war to the last ounce of steam ; it and other old-timers push 1000 tankers of oil out of Texas every day , releasing heavies for the main-line jobs that highball troop trains , aluminum and machinery over the long single-track line which feeds the Southern California defense plants . Old John Power pioneered many an idea that is stretching engines for the Espee . One of the best was a method for purifying water in the big black tanks strung along the rails winding across the desert . Desert water is notoriously damaging to locomotives . Not so long ago , the engines on these runs across the desert used to go to the roundhouse after every trip for an eight-hour boiler washout . Twice a month they were shopped to have their boilers scraped , a job that took several days . Today , the Espee 's engines use purified water all along the system , except in the Sierra Nevada and the Cascades , where aqua pura is melted snow .

" ceeded in numbers only by the Pennsylvania and the New York Central . In oomph , the stuff that moves war cargoes over the grades , it is second to none . Each of the smoothly huffing big wamps generates 124,300 pounds of tractive force . During the lean years , when most railroads were riding out the storm without incurring expenses , canny Mr. McDonald was borrowing big money for new locomotives ? $64,000,000 worth . When he died suddenly and Mercier took the helm , one of Mercier 's first acts was to earmark $12,000,000 more for additional engines , bringing the new power order up to 180 main-line steam locomotives and 102 speedy Diesel switching engines to prevent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service locomotives badly needed for handling of trains . The Siamese Twins The last of the monster AC 's were delivered early this year . AC stands for **25;2014;TOOLONG . They are Siamese-twin locomotives , so to speak , with two eight-wheeled sets of drivers fed from one jumbo boiler . Moat of these 6000-horsepower giants were built with the cabs in front , so that the man at the throttle , pushing through storms , snow-sheds and around mountains , no longer peers through smoke and steam and along 100 feet of boiler to catch the lights of the block signals . " He 's out in front where he belongs , " explained Bill Hack . " Mister , these babies are power . " Hack needs power to shove upward of 100 trains a day over The Hill . Two years ago the Southern Pacific was an eastbound-traffic road primarily . Three fourths of its business was hauling perishables from Pacific Coast farms to Eastern cities . The refrigerator cars rolled east loaded with foodstuffs , as many as 260,000 in a single year , then rattled west @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ October , then traffic tapered off into several months of leisurely railroading . Those days are gone . " Every day 's a peak now , " said unruffled Jim Corbett , assistant general manager . Corbett 's job is known in the railroad 's vernacular as " dishing the engines out , " or as " working power into hot territory . " The first year of war , following another year of preparing for war , saw the westbound industrial loads grow month by month until they topped the eastbound agricultural-cargo flow . This new traffic has forced the system to haul both loads and empties each way . Pacific Coast perishables roll east in reefers  --  refrigerator cars . Steel and machinery for shipyards , aluminum for the aircraft factories , guns , tanks , trucks and supplies for the outbound convoys go west in boxcars and gondolas . " You ca n't load oranges on a gondola and you ca n't put steel plates in a reefer , " lamented one of the railroad 's executives .
