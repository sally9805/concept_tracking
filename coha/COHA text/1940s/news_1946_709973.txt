txt For the second time in his long career as a labor leader , John L. Lewis was directed by a Federal court today to cancel an order which the Government holds will mean a stoppage of work by 400,000 members of the United Mine Workers of America at midnight Wednesday . Judge T. Alan Goldsborough of the Federal District Court in tho District of Columbia , acting upon the application of Attorney General Tom C. Clark , signed the temporary order . It restrains all union officials and their attorneys from permitting to continue in effect the union notice served on Secretazy of the Interior J. A. Krug purporting to terminate on five days ' notice the Krug-Lewis contract of May 29 . Since the union 's practice of " no contract no work " will mean a strike on Nov. 20 , Mr. Lewis has until then to make his decision . If he fails to withdraw the cancellation order he will lay himself open to a contempt of court charge and a possible jail sentence or fine , officials of the Government say . Hearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fixed Nov. 27 , at 10 A. M. , as the time for hearing on the preliminary injunction request . The Attorney General filed with 1 the court voluminous affidavits from eight Federal officials asserting that a work stoppage would cause " great loss and irreparable damage " to the country , " will adversely affect great public interests , and will seriously endanger the public welfare and safety . " As a result of these complaints the court was asked for a declaratory judgment stating that the union had no right to give any notice purporting to end the Krug- . Lewis agreement at any time during Government possession of the mines . Mr. Lewis ' argument was that this agreement , carrying over a provision of a previous contract which the miners had with the operators , permitted either side to cancel it on due notice . The Attorney General asserted that Mr. Lewis ' notice of " unilateral " termination of the KrugLewis agreement constituted " in fact and in effect " a call to strike . This allegation was taken into cognizance by Justice Goldsborough in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Gov. ernment 's complaint that by issuing his " unilateral " cancellation notice the union president had violated provisions of the War Labor Disputes ( Smith-Connally ) Act , which ban strike action against facilities seized by the Government . Conviction may mean a fine of $1,000 or ( and ) one year in jail . Order Served on Leader The restraining order was signed at 12:50 P. M. and an hour later two Federal marshals appeared at the office of K. C. Adams , editor of the Mine Workers Journal , in the ornate miners ' offices , and announced their mission . Mr. Adams escorted the marshals to the sixth floor offices of Mr. Lewis and formally introduced them to the rotund man seated behind a big , flat-topped desk . The officers deposited the papers with Mr. Lewis and left . Mr. Lewis had no comment . Mr. Adams said there would be none in view of the drastic terms of the restraining order . It was recalled at the miners ' // offices that in November , 1920 , ( erroneously stated in this column @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordered the union to rescind a strike notice . In a notice signed by Mr. Lewis and William Green , who was then secretary-treasurer , the miners were told that the order issued Oct. 15 , 1920 , " directing a cessation of operations in the bituminous coal fields is withdrawn and canceled . " At that time Mr. Lewis said : " We will not fight our Government . " Men Stayed Out in 1920 A story current at the time was that Mr. Green , now president of the American Federation of Labor , had forgotten to affix the union 's stamp on the cancellation order . Whether for that reason or not , the miners did not return to work for six weeks . They took their places in the pits only when a Federal Coal Commission was named and an arbiter ordered a pay increase . Whether events this time may parallel those of twenty-six years ago was a matter of speculation today . If the union obeys the restraining order and cancels its notice of contract termination , the miners may still remain away from work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action today was taken after full consultation by Interior and Justice Department officials with President Truman . This was made clear in dispatches from Florida , where the President is on a brief vacation . That a Government injunction suit against the country 's outstanding militant labor leader might raise him to the status of a " martyr " for labor 's cause was also taken into account at these preliminary discussions . Despite this possibility Mr. Truman gave the signal for a " finish fight " against Mr. Lewis . Walkouts Already Begun Several hours before the Government 's action , miners in several States began to walk out , three days in advance of the deadline . By tonight it was reported that more than 32,000 miners were idle , the major number in Illinois and Pennsylvania . Others were out in Ohio , Indiana , West Virginia and Kentucky . If precedents are any guide , many more miners will probe ably be out tomorrow , and by 1Wednesday , shortly before the deadline , most of the coal diggers may have left their posts . Recognizing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Defense Transportation today ordered a 25 per cent reduction in railroad passenger service performed by coalburning locomotives . The order is effective at 11:59 P. M. Sunday . The affidavits filed with the Government 's court complaint were signed by Mr. Krug as Secretary of the Interior , and by Robert P. Patterson , Secretary of War ; James Forrestal , Secretary of the Navy ; J. D. Small , Administrator , Civilian Production Administration ; G. H. Helmbold , Managing Director , Ship Operations , . United States Maritime Commission ; Leland Oliis , Chairman , Federal Power Commission ; James A. Crabtree , Acting Surgeon General , United States Public Health Serveice , and J. M. Johnson , Director , Office of Defense Transportation . The Goldsborough order restrained Mr.aLewis and any of the defendants from continuing in effect the Lewis notice of Nov. 15 to Mr. Krug cancelling the Krug-Lewis contract " anefrom coercing , instigating , inducing or encouraging the mine workers at the bituminous coal mines in the Government 's possession to interfere by strike , slowdown , walkout , cessation of work or otherwise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect the aforesaid notice or by issuing any notice of termination of agreement , or through any other means or device from interfering with or obstructing the exercise by the Secretary of the Interior of his functions under Executive Order 9,728 . " Truman Seized Mines in May The country 's mines were seized by President Truman on May 22 last under Executive Order 9,728 after a strike which began on April 1 . In its brief seeking the temporary restraining order the Government held that the Norris-La Guardia Anti-Injunction Act , passed in 1932 , did not affect the situation . Not only did the defendants ' action " contravene public policy , " and become violative of the War Labor Disputes Act , but it would bar the Government from " judicial protection of its rights lawfully to exercise its sovereign functions without interference or obstruction , " according to the brief . In this connection the brief cited the famous Government injunction against Eugene V. Debs , Socialist leader of the American railway strike in 1894 , and several other cases of a like nature . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government 's right to injunctive pro- , tection in any way . The brief added : " The Norris-La Guardia Act marked the culmination of a fiftyyear controversy as to the right of workers in private employ to organize and by collective means to obtain acceptable terms and conditions of employment . " Specifically it removed the injunctive process from the area of labor combat between employer and employe . In no sense , however , does the Norris-La Guardia act purport to deal with the problem here presented ; the invocation by the United States of the equitable powers of the courts to prevent irreparable injury to the interests of the people of the United States pending a peaceful judicial determination of a disputed legal problem . " In his request for a restraining order , Attorney General Clark held that the union 's termination notice breached its contract with the ? Government , violated the Smith-Connally act and interfered with the " sovereign functions of the United States , " which , he said were necessary to insure operation of the coal properties " in the interests of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present emergency .
