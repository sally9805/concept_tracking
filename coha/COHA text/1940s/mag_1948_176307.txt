Last fall it would have been a dream team . For his College All-Star squad , Notre Dame 's Coach Frank Leahy had lined up such 1947 gridiron greats as Michigan 's Bob Chappuis , Notre Dame 's Johnny Lujack and Mississippi 's Chuck Conerly . In Chicago last week , before a crowd of 101,220 , the collegians ( most of whom would shortly be pros ) kicked off against the Chicago Cardinals , 1947 pro champions of the National Football League . <P> The Cardinals , led by Missouri 's Paul Christman and Georgia 's Charlie Trippi , were out to justify their paychecks ( the collegians have won the last two games ) . From a T-formation , the Cardinals marched 80 yards to the game 's first touchdown , stopped the only All-Star bid on the one-yard line , scored the most one-sided victory in the 15-year series , 28-0.
