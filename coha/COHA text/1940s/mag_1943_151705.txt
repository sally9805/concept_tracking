TIME 's Chance <P> Sirs : <P> I suppose people would n't write letters like this one if they were back in the States where bars and music halls take up spare time . . . . <P> I never liked TIME or LIFE until I was drafted , which was two and a half years ago . Since then , however , I 've watched their circulation and influence in the Army . . . . <P> Soldiers , like all Americans , read news and editorials and either swallow them whole or discredit them entirely , depending upon what newspaper or magazine they had . I 'm talking about 95% of soldiers . But those who read TIME neither swallow nor discredit immediately what they read . . . . <P> The point of what I want to say is ... that you have the first honest and yet successful news organ there has ever been . And that is a fact which defeats some of the real diseases our country has , including its lack of moral and spiritual strength . . . . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chance your magazines have to change and clean up the American spirit , and force American taste and thought to better themselves . . . you have the chance to do what every thinking soldier overseas longs will be done every time he thinks of home . . . . <P> ( SGT . ) HARRY WILLIAMS <P> c/o Postmaster Miami <P> &gt; TIME 's thanks to Sergeant Williams for a heartening letter ; and TIME 's sober assurance that it realizes its share of the responsibility of the U.S. press and the challenge it faces. - ED . <P> Lovely Old Madison <P> Sirs : <P> It may interest you to know that there is still a town in the U.S. not marred by the war or the New Deal . <P> I was driving from Pensacola to Jacksonville , Fla. when dusk halted me in the lovely old town of Madison . Going to the old red brick hotel , I was shown to a nicely furnished room with private bath . Being hungry , I hurried down to supper . The old colored waiter shuffled to my table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beef , baked ham , fried chicken and T-bone steak , " he replied . I ordered the steak . . . and he shuffled out . Presently he set before me tomato juice and avocado salad . This was followed by the steak with French-fried potatoes , Golden Bantam corn , a dish of green field peas , ice tea and hot biscuits with country butter . For dessert there was a generous piece of banana cream pie with real whipped cream . . .85 . <P> R. W. WILSON <P> Pensacola , Fla . <P> Presidential Base on Balls <P> Sirs : <P> A pop bottle on your head , smarty ! For characterizing the man who said " We waited it out , and we got a base on balls " ( TIME , July 26 ) as Pitcher Roosevelt . . . . <P> BILL ROGERS <P> Wright Field <P> Dayton <P> Sirs : <P> TIME adds nothing but confusion to a Presidential metaphor when , in commenting on F.D.R. 's characterization of U.S. Martinique victory as a " base on balls , " it adds : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roosevelt 's way . . . . " <P> Any baseball fan knows 1 ) that Mr. Roosevelt 's role in " waiting it out " was that of a batter rather than a pitcher , and 2 ) that pop bottles are traditionally reserved for umpires . <P> ARCH FARMER <P> Chicago <P> &gt; Some pitchers are pretty fair hitters ; pop bottles are sometimes carelessly aimed. - ED . <P> Advertising Art <P> Sirs :
