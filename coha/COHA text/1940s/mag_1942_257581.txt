U.S. citizens last week beheld a preview of what the peace table may be like . The actors were scholars and pundits ; but their show had plenty of unacademic gusto . It raised a question considerably more immediate than the peace itself : were the American people well enough educated to know a just peace when they saw one ? <P> The debate opened last month when a geography professor named George T. Renner , of Columbia University 's Teachers College , published in Collier 's a map of a post-war world drawn to " democratic specifications " ( TIME , June 15 ) . A disciple of the small but respectable school of American geopoliticos which includes Yale 's Professor Nicholas John Spykman ( America 's Strategy in World Politics- TIME , April 20 ) , Professor Renner believes that scholars , not " amateurs , " are best able to write the peace . <P> Rushing in where more eminent scholars had feared to tread , Renner undertook to translate the Atlantic Charter and other " noble statements " by amateurs ( i.e. , statesmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astounded at the result . His geopolitical Europe was divided into nine big nations , with Axis Germany and Italy left apparently as strong as the victorious United Nations themselves . <P> First " amateur " to pound the table and point was Columnist Dorothy Thompson . Cried Dorothy : " If the Axis settled tomorrow for anything resembling Professor Renner 's new maps of the world , it would have won an overwhelming victory . " A group of University of Minnesota professors petitioned President Roosevelt to remove Professor Renner from his job as adviser to the Civil Aeronautics Administration . When Professor Renner arrived at Minnesota soon afterward to lecture on geography teaching , Stratosphere Scholar Jean Picard rose to demand what Professor Renner meant by proposing to partition his native republic of Switzerland . Professor Renner haughtily ignored him . <P> Paper Dolls . Last week a more formidable heckler , Pundit Walter Lippmann , entered the debate . Mr. Lippmann devoted three columns to probing " The Case of Professor R " and concluded that there was reason to be alarmed by the U.S. educational system . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mind unconsciously conceiving a series of atrocious and irreparable crimes in order to make a more perfect world . He believes , for example , that ' to meet democratic specifications , ' we should exterminate the Swiss republic . The reader must bear with me ; I know this is revolting . <P> " Professor R 's vice was the habit of regarding other men as inanimate objects . He thought of the Swiss as so many paper dolls . Since the world of Professor R was composed entirely of paper dolls , he cut them up and pasted them together with no sense of reality , and therefore with no feeling of responsibility , and therefore with no consciousness of guilt . How is it possible for our educational system to produce such a case ? <P> " The almost certain answer is that he is the product of an academic system in which the study of moral wisdom has been abandoned . It turns out reformers without moral restraint , humanitarians without human respect , philanthropists without philosophy , and enthusiasts without religion . "   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
