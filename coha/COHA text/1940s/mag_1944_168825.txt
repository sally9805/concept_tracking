Eleanor Medill ( " Cissie " ) Patterson 's Washington Times-Herald picks up most of the bitterly anti-Roosevelt editorials and cartoons spawned by her brother Joe 's New York Daily News and her cousin Bertie McCormick 's Chicago Tribune . They rarely pick up any of hers . When 59-year-old " Cissie " takes pen in hand , the result is likely to be so rancorous that it shocks even a well-blunted masculine sense of fair play . <P> Last week , brought to boil by President Roosevelt 's refusal to allow draft deferments for premedical students under 26 , Publisher Cissie let go a characteristic kidney-punch . She filled a page with a signed editorial and pictures of 20 young ( 24 to 37 ) career men of the State Department " who do not choose to fight . " <P> Hissed Cissie : " If the Army really needs ALL the able-bodied young men it can get , " it can find in Secretary Hull 's fold " an assortment of rich , able-bodied and unmarried boys of no particular use to anyone . ... There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fill the jobs of these young men . " <P> It would really be good for " the ' pantywaist brigade ' ( and is n't that vulgar ? ) , " snapped Cissie , to have a taste of war . Even Bill Bullitt " might have lost his insatiable appetite for intrigue before the present disaster " if he had " risked his young blood and guts and tears in the last World War instead of cutting dramatic capers at the Versailles Peace Conference . " <P> And just while she was on the subject , " the President himself has no first-hand knowledge of war either , we might add . Like his little boy friends , Pearson and Winchell , he stayed far away from the battlefield of the first World War. * Although at that time a young man , and in perfect physical condition , he did ' his bit ' as Assistant Secretary of the Navy-right here in Washington . " <P> " Violent , Unfair . " At his next press conference , Cordell Hull angrily detailed the deferment record , age and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ printed . All but four , he announced , are overseas , many in jobs of direct military assistance . No man under 26 in his department is draft-deferred . Publicly , the whip-tongued old Secretary called Cissie 's tirade " violent and unfair , grossly unfair . " His private comments were probably purple . <P> ** Columnist Drew Pearson , Publisher Patterson 's onetime son-in-law , was in college during World War I , later served overseas with the American Friends Service Committee . Winchell was ( and still is ) in the U.S. Naval Reserve .
