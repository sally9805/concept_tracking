txt THE TREASURY THREATENS to recommend a veto for estate and gift tax changes pending now in the Senate . Officials were n't pleased with H. R. 5268. covering some rather minor technical changes , when it passed the House . They are strongly opposed to the more important amendments tacked on by the Senate Finance Committee . President Truman . who is on record in favor of tougher estate taut laws . is likely to follow his &dalliers'; recommendations for a veto of the bill if It should pass Congress in anything like the form approved by the Senate committee . The biggest change is one taxing " reversionary " interests at their actuarial value . This is an outgrowth of the Spiegel case . in which the Supreme Court held that a $1,140 , - 000 trust fund was fully taxable under the estate tax because there was a remote chance that it could revert to Sidney M. Spiegel 's estate . Mr. Spiegel. like many other wealthy people . put much of his property into a trust fund and directed that it be paid to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this transfer but expected the fund to escape the estate tax . which is roughly half again as heavy . The Spiegel fund could only become part of Mr. Spiegel 's estate if he outlived all his children and grandchildren . He had six such heirs at the time of his death , and actuaries said his chance of recovering the trust fund by ontlivmg them was worth only about $70 . The Senate committee 's amendment , by taxing this " reversionary " interest of the Spiegel fund only at its actuarial value , would thus reduce the estate tax deficiency on the fund from $454.768 to almost nothing . ? ? THE TAX COURT recently applied the Spiegel decision to a similar trust fund set up by Ruth Brainard Cutler . She put life ihsurance policies valued at $135.000 into an irrevocable trust . directed that payments be made to her children and their descendants , and paid gift tax on this transfer . Four children and three grandchildren were living when she died . so the actuarial value of any " reversionary " interests would be very small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survived her progeny and , if she had . Connecticut Wer would pro-ide that the fund become part or bee estate anti subject to her will . The tax court si ? - reed and approved a tax of some $41,470 . ? ? ? THE TREASURY ALSO OPPOSES an amendment designed to nullify the Supreme Court 's ruling in the Church case . In effect , this amendment would waive estate taxes on trust funds that pay income to the donor during his life , providing these funds were set up before March 4 , 1931. and providing the donor died after February 20 , 1939 . This legislation harks back to 1930 when the Supreme Court held that trust funds from which the donor reserved a life income were not subject to the estate tax . In 1931 Congress decreed that such funds should be taxed , but it didn t attempt to change the law retroactively . So until January this year many people thought funds set up before 1931 were not affected by the ' 31 law . But in the Church case , the Supreme Court reversed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the estate tax . The Treasury has announced it will try to collect taxes on them . The Senate amendment would free such funds from estate taxes if they were set up before 1931 when the bill was passed and if the donor died after the specified date . The measure would , inciantally , relieve the Church estate from some 536,850 in estate taxes approved by the high court . ? ? ? THE ORIGINAL TAX BILL , as it passed the House , contained another section dealing with reciprocal trusts that the Treasury does n't like . These trusts usually are set up by husband and wife . Mr. X puts property into an irrevocable fund , designates his wife as beneficiary and gives her power to name other beneficiaries . Mrs. X sets up a similar fund for Mr. X to receive or distribute . The gift tax is paid on each transfer . Taxpayers hoped these funds would not be subject to the estate tax , though Mrs. X could dispose of property in the fund created for her just as if it were part of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property set aside for him . But in the Lehman case in 1940 an appeals court held that estate taxes should be paid . The Lehman decision posed a dilemma for taxpayers who tried this . They might still avoid the estate tax by giving up their powers to name beneficiaries . Mrs. X would renounce the right given her by Mr. X to dispose of the fund he set up , and Mr. X would give up similar powers over the fund set up by his wife . But waiving these rights would make Mr. and Mrs. X subject to a second gut tax on each fund  --  on the theory that by giving up their right to name beneficiaries they have made the fund a gift of their property rights . To protect them from having to pay a second time , the House bill says taxpayers in this fix could give up their powers of appointment before December 31 , 1950. without paying a gift tax . The Senate committee limited thus exemption to cases where the gift tax had already been paid in setting up the funds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their trusts before the gift tax went into effect . ? ? ? THE TREASURY EYES all such trust fund transactions with suspicion . They have been used frequently , in Indian giver fashion , to take advantage of the lower gift tax rate and avoid the estate duty , without really losing control of the property . The government is quite indignant , after the courts upheld its interpretation of the law and ruled against such avoidance , that Congress may let the taxpayers go scot-free .
