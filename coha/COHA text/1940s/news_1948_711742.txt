txt Dr. Shields Warren , head of the atomic energy commission 's medical department , said today several United States scientists were going blind as a result , apparently , of radiation from atom-smashing machines . Dr. Warren , who said there were " aboutfivh " in the country , added : " There is no evidence at the present time that they were working on the immediate problems of atomic energy . " Cyclotron Researchers Rather , he declared , it is believed they had all been engaged in research involving the use of cyclotrons  --  university or other projects " not closely associated " with the commission 's work . " It has been clearly established , " he explained , " that exposure to radiation will injure the lens of the eye and so cause cataracts . " Nevertheless , Dr. Warren said , the commission is checking to determine if any of the scientists " were associated , with atomic energy activities. ! ' Machine Dangers High He emphasized , too , that the dangers of radiation leakage in the government 's and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involving the atom-smashing machines , In respect to government atomic energy.projects , he said , " the hazards , as far as we can tell from present experience , are extremely slight . " Dr. Warren said he did not know the names of the scientists . Dr. J. 0 , Hamilton , director of the Crocker laboratory at the University of California , in which a 60 inch cyclotron is housed , confirmed that five atomic scientists had developed cataracts . He declined to identify the five or disclose their whereabouts , but asserted , " These were all cyclotron exposures , a type of work in which there is a calculated risk . " One scientist was exposed before the war , he said , and the other ' tout during the war . A cataract is an opacity of the lens of the eye often correctible by surgery .
