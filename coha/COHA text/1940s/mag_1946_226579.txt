Some commercial DDT preparations available to U.S. householders and gardeners have proved 1 ) disappointingly feeble , 2 ) harmful to plants and animals . But the U.S. Department of Agriculture last week declared that DDT , properly used , is still the best insecticide . To help citizens prepare for their annual battle with the bugs , the Department gave out some advice : <P> For flies , mosquitoes , bedbugs , roaches : Use a 5% DDT solution in kerosene , painted or sprayed on screens , walls , mattresses , under sinks , shelves . It is good up to six months but a fire hazard when first applied . Aerosol bombs are less effective than painting ; although they kill all insects in sight , they leave no lasting deposit . <P> For dogs ' fleas , ticks , lice : Dust with a 10% DDT powder-but do n't use it on cats , because they lick off the dust . DDT solutions are dangerous to animals . <P> For shade trees : A .1% DDT emulsion destroys tent caterpillars , cankerworms , gypsy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some other pests . Warning : it increases the population of red mites , by killing their parasites . <P> For vegetables : A 3% DDT dust against cabbage caterpillars , applied no later than 30 days before the cabbage is to be eaten , seems to be safe . <P> For grain bins and warehouses : Spray walls and woodwork with 5% DDT in kerosene . Do n't get it on the grain ; treat bins when empty . <P> For fruit trees : Do n't use . Because DDT is a cumulative poison and apparently injures some plants , it is unsafe to use on most fruits and vegetables until further tests have been made . <P> The Department of Agriculture added a reassuring word : the danger of handling DDT has been greatly exaggerated . It is less toxic than other insecticides ( arsenate of lead , nicotine ) , in two years has not injured any of the thousands of workers who have handled it constantly .
