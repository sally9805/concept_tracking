txt An arms-aid bill not too different from the $1,450,000,000 being asked by President Truman appears in the making . The House Foreign Affairs Committee on Aug. 15 approved the full $1,160,990,000 that was asked for the Atlantic Pact powers , though at the same time limiting first-year cash spending to $655 , - 840,000 , with the rest to be in contract authorizations . As this is along the lines already agreed to by the administration , the House committee action is considered a victory for the President and Secretary of State Dean Acheson . At the same time the prctpect of passage by the Senate and eventual approval by both houses became easier with announcement of the major amendments proposed by the two leading Republican senators Arthur H. Vandenberg of Michigan and . John Foster Dulles of New York . They alter the administration 's plan for administration of the arms fund and  --  like the House action  --  limit cash spending this year , but they do not trim the total by more than $160,900.000 . Curb in Authority They eliminated authority to use $115,000,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on grounds that this should wait a decision taken fully under the not yet established Atlantic Pact council . While the administration does not approve of this cut  --  small as it is in the total ? it may not be unwilling to accept it for the sake of salvaging the much larger remainder . In brief , the Vandenberg-Dulles changes being offered as the only way to get the arms aid through Congress with bipartisan support are : 1 . The requested cash appropriation of $1,160,990,000 for the pact nations would be cut to $1 , - 000,000,000 , with $500,000,000 sought in cash appropriations now and the remainder in contract authority for future spending . 2 . Congress , by resolution , could order the entire program discontinued if it appeared that Europe 's self-help , mutual-aid , and collective defense plans were " going sour . " The congressional veto would prevail until the United States agrees to a common defense plan under the pact . In addition , the presidential right to cut off arms would be retained . No Revolving Fund 3 . Any foreign currency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for administration purposes and not as a " revolving fund " for more arms shipments . 4 . An " ambiguity " would be removed which raised the question of presidential prerogative on complying with any decision of the United Nations Security Council . " The amended bill , " the senators said , ' would keep full faith with our partners of the North Atlantic Community , assuring them on the one hand a prompt beginning of substantial military assistance , and on the other hind , the transformation of such assistance from national auspices to the collective integrating auspices of the treaty as soon as this is possible . Support Expected " We believe that , with the amendments outlined , the bill should receive , and will receive , the support of the Congress and the country , " they said , Although there have " been consultations with Mr. Acheson on the changes , Senator Vandenberg emphasized they had not received Mr. Acheson 's " blessings , " and that they were being presented solely for the two senators . With the House Foreign Affairs Committee action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dulles , the military assistance program faces a brighter future than at any time since its presentation to Congress . The State Department , therefore , is more than ever hopeful that it can get practically all of what it asked for . Despite this , there surely will be heated argument in the Senate committee and fireworks on the two floors . GOP Proposal This was clearly evident as Republican Senators Vandenberg and Dulles advanced a plan of their own that would mesh the arms shipments plan into the common defense efforts of the Atlantic Pact . While both of these influential Republican senators have supported an arms program in principle , they have differed pointedly with the administration on detail .
