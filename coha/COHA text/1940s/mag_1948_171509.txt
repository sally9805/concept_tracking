In hand-to-hand fighting last week , Communist troops battered into Anshan , steel capital of Manchuria . Anshan 's fall tightened the Red ring about Mukden , but the loss had a deeper significance . What had changed hands was the chief symbol of Manchuria 's industrial promise . <P> The Japanese had been first to exploit Anshan 's strategic location in the midst of Manchuria 's iron and coal resources . They built furnaces for pig iron and steel , rolling mills , coke ovens and chemical byproducts plants . Up to V-J day Anshan 's steel output ( nearly 2,000,000 tons ) was the biggest on the Asiatic continent . <P> At war 's end , the Russians removed much of Anshan 's movable equipment ; the Nanking government was never able to restore production to more than a fraction of what it had been . For China , Anshan had remained just a promise . This week , the promise , like most of Manchuria , belonged to others .                @ @ @ @ @
