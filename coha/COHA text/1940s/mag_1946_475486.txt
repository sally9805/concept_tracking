IN A Washington which is hip-deep in little men , anybody of real stature commands attention . During the past five months , as he has shoved his way ? suavely but firmly ? through a herd of bureaucratic midgets , Chester B. Bowles has become about the most conspicuous man in the Truman administration . He has also become a rather troublesome enigma to the bosses of both parties . They ca n't quite figure out how big he really is ; none of the usual political yardsticks fit . According to the rule-book , Bowles should be a hopeless political failure . He is a wealthy businessman ; he has never run for any office ; as head of OPA he held what was supposedly the most unpopular job in Washington . Yet he has built up , somehow , an astonishing volume of belligerent public support . In comparison with a Roosevelt , a La Guardia , or an Ickes , his personality is mild ; but he has generated a kind of fanatic loyalty among the people who work with him . He came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technique of bureaucratic in-fighting . Then he succeeded , after a long and embittered struggle in February , in wrenching most of the real authority away from John Snyder , the President 's intimate friend and most trusted lieutenant . As a result he emerged with more power over the nation 's economy ? and more liability for crises tocome ? than any other administrator in Washington . Most surprising of all , Bowles won his victory almost entirely on political grounds . His only effective weapon was a threat to resign ? and the administration 's political strategists ( including Hannegan , Vinson , and Byrnes ) finally convinced the President that they could n't afford to let him do it . Bowles , they said , was too strong with the voters . H ow did Bowles manage to build up this entirely unexpected kind of political muscle ? His friends sometimes try to explain it by pointing out certain superficial parallels between his career and Roosevelt 's . Bowles at Choate School and Yale , like F.D.R. at Groton and Harvard , distinguished himself chiefly as a conformer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? in Bowles ' case his grandfather , the fighting editor of the Springfield Republican ? may have damped down any early enthusiasm for progressive causes . Roosevelt 's shift to the left is variously ascribed to an almost barometric sensitivity to changes in the public mood ; to his paralysis in middle life ; to the influence of his wife ; and to a patrician contempt for the acquisitive virtues . Bowles made his fortune by reading correctly the public 's temperature ; he suffered twice in his youth from severe cases of mastoid that have affected his manner of speech ; his wife ? almost as active as Mrs. Roosevelt ? was trained in the Smith College School for Social Work ; his ancestry has numbered the gentry among it at least as far back in Colonial times , Both men enjoyed the role of country squire , and both acquired a passion for sailing . Some admirers even detect a certain physical resemblance between Roosevelt and the big , lantern-jawed , sloppily elegant Stabilization Director . mitcsE coincidences , however , hardly I add up to an explanation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indication of political talent or political interest in his early life . Bowles grew up in an atmosphere of great memories that must have hung like a curtain of frustration over the uneventful stage of his youth . His mother was a woman of natural grace who loved people , and whom he worshipped . His father was hearty , totally conservative , and barely holding his own in the paper-pulp business of Springfield , Massachusetts . Bowles remembers bitter arguments over the New Freedom and the League of Nations , and the support he sometimes received in these from a favorite aunt , Ruth Bowles Baldwin , whose husband founded the National Urban League ( a Negro welfare organization on whose board Bowles serves today ) . But the prevailing family atmosphere was standpat . In the background , however , the young man must have sensed the ironic ghost of his grandfather . It was in 1844 that Samuel Bowles of Springfield had taken over the weekly country newspaper which his father had started twenty years before . By the outbreak of the Civil War Sam Bowles had made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nation , declared to be " the most comprehensive daily paper in the country . " He was an autocrat no doubt , as his critics contended , scorning not only political regularity but religious orthodoxy . But he was loved by the men he most bitterly attacked , and declared once that " there is no other line of influence or noble effort in this world except in behalf of ideals . " Overwork killed him atfifty-four . As he lay dying one neighbor is said to have remarked to another ; " He wo n't pull through ; he 's too sick . " To which the second replied : " That 's too bad , because he wo n't like God . " Whether or not Chester Bowles ' later life may be regarded as a tribute to this formidable tradition , his young manhood appears to have been an escape from it . At Choate he played baseball but studied indifferently enough to require tutoring for his college entrance papers . Though he helped pay his way with a clerk 's job in New Haven , classmates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right clubs , captain of the golf team . Bowles held his own but he hardly stood out . His ambition to excel in whatever he did was already great ? but in what direction did his talents really point ? There was no answer . Out of college , he tried a spell of cub reporting in Springfield ; there was grandfather 's ghost hovering above him . He knocked at the door of the State Department in Washington , then at Commerce ; there was nothing promising there . He toyed with the idea of art criticism , took a few piano lessons . Then the decision was made for him . His father 's business failed and he had to support the family . At the Yale Club employment agency in New York he found there was a job open for a copywriter in the George Batten advertising agency . A CORDING to William Benton , who had left Yale three years earlier and was already in charge of a dozen copywriters at Batten 's , Bowles came to the agency without the most elementary knowledge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older man found immediately attractive ; the writing he quickly mastered . Four years later , when the two made plans to set up their own agency , they were already a team to be reckoned with . It would be hard to conceive of two partners more dissimilar in character , tastes , and appearance . The future Assistant Secretary of State already had his own retirement plans ( a well-kept secret ) , his cosmic self-confidence , his missionary zeal to sell culture to the world , his jet-propelled tempo . In 1928 Benton had turned down an invitation to join Lord &; Thomas at double his $25,000 salary , on the grounds that if he was worth that to somebody else he must be worth twice as much to himself . Benton was short , professionally jovial , natty in his attire , lynx-eyed with a whimsical , appraising half-smile , and his stop-watch efficiency was a little awesome . Bowles , in contrast , was oversized , his brown suit was always in need of repairs , and he was often late for appointments because he got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . He kidded the overworked office staff into a sense of personal participation in his own tireless enthusiasm . He was the firm 's idea-man ; he had visions . At first they were visions of unlimited sales . Bowles brought to his work the greatest asset an advertising man can have ? the unquestioning conviction that bigger sales of whatever product he was interested in at the moment would make the world healthier , happier , and more prosperous . ( A shrewd commentator on the advertising giants of that day remarked that " most of them have an unlimited capacity for honestly believing in the products they are promoting . Sophistication and cynicism in their work . . . heads them for oblivion . " ) Although Bowles is reputed to have coined the phrase " Double-whipped " for Hellman 's mayonnaise , his first real contribution was in a then-new field , radio . He designed the first shows in which " the atmosphere to fit the product " dwarfed the individual star , and effective plugs were so skillfully concealed that the average listener hardly knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1935 showed that three of the five top radio programs that year ? Maxwell House 's " Showboat , " the Palmolive operetta series , and Ipana-Sal Hepatica 's " Town Hall " ? were Bowles ' creations . In that year the firm of Benton &; Bowles ? which had started in 1929 with less than $25,000 capital and which ten months later had sunk to $2,000 in the red was one of the nation 's ten largest and doing an $8,000 , 000 annual business . The idea of low unit costs and huge production was perhaps the secret of the agency 's rise . It was in Bowles ' mindwhen he induced first Maxwell House , and later General Foods , Palmolive , and Columbia Records , to slash their prices and aim for mass sales . Hearing his clients talk about the " menace of the consumer movement " led him a step further . He prepared a report which pointed out that the lower one-third of Americans were living in a separate economic world from the upper two-thirds , and that if business wanted to expand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to enable the bottom third of the nation to buy . At the time this sounded like revolutionary doctrine , both to the advertising profession and to most business men . But it won adherents , and his efforts to spread the faith took Bowles a step beyond his circle . He met Don Montgomery , then Consumer Counsel for the Department of Agriculture , now with the United Automobile Workers . He began to read such heretical economists as David Cushman Coyle and Stuart Chase . N THE meanwhile he had suffered and I overcome a crisis in his personal life . To go back a little , in 1933 Bowles and his first wife , Julia Mayo Fisk , had been divorced . More and more he had been agonizing over his work and had begun to wrestle with the larger issues taking shape from it ; perhaps his wife had taken refuge in a social life which he , whose relationships with people must be intimate and intense , found enervating . They parted friends , but Bowles missed his two children and stood in need of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coast of Africa on the Rex in 1934 he renewed an old friendship with Dorothy Stebbins , whom he had met at Vassar ten years earlier . The following winter they were married . Dorothy Stebbins Bowles had already begun to work out a promising career of her own . She was then traveling director of the national Junior League . At college she had been class president . She was outstandingly popular in any company , a born mimic , a singer , and gifted with humor and great understanding . Bow/es at this stage in his life was beginning to feel doubts about the validity of his job , and he had overworked himself to the point of a nervous breakdown . A Cruise on his schooner to Nova Scotia in the summer of 1935 gave some relief , but the idea of returning to his office amounted almost to a fear . His wife , perhaps by encouraging his growing conviction that he could solve the conflict of his advertising career only by freeing himself from it entirely , helped him to regain his self-confidence . The following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his clients and associates , that he was leaving the marketing business for good , Bowles was prepared for the blow . " Everybody else , " Benton recalls , " pleaded , threatened , and argued endlessly trying to make me change my mind . Chet said nothing for a week or two and then one day at lunch he asked me casually , ' Bill , do you think it 's wise to leave until you have an offer in some other field , or until you know exactly what you want ? ' I replied : ' Chet , if I wait for that , I 'll never leave ; the perfect job will never appear or never look perfect enough , ' and Chet said , ' I think you 're absolutely right ; you owe it to yourself to leave now , and I admire you for having the guts to do it . ' " T took four years for Bowles to bring the I agency back to its peak , after a series of withdrawn accounts had been recaptured or replaced only by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own kind of guts under circumstances far more disturbing . Out of a strong belief that the time to participate in the war had not arrived , he had agreed to become one of the directors of America First . There had been a few internationalists like himself in that organization in early 1941 and Bowles had felt that he should use his influence to keep it from becoming narrowly nationalistic . What happened , of course , was that the real isolationists took over , only to lose control , in their turn , to the CoughlinMcWilliams crowd . Bowles sensed the direction in which the organization resign publicly . Friends who suspected that he might have a political future warned him , and several of Benton &; Bowles ' biggest clients let it beknown that they were thinking of withdrawing their accounts . Bowles refused to be pressured into quitting . But in October of 1941 he wrote an article entitled " What 's Wrong with the Isolationists ? " which made his own position clear . In it he said : Most Internationalists are Interventionists . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participation in the war . This group believes that the Four Freedoms can not be won by the sword . They believe that our entry into the war would weaken rather than strengthen our power to aid international understanding and collaboration after the war ... . The standpat Isolationist is wrong because , whether he likes it or not , we can not maintain our economic and social status quo behind a barricade of armaments . When the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor two weeks after publication of this article , Bowles volunteered for the Navy . When the report on his physical examination was delayed , he turned over the firm to his partners and was offered by Governor Hurley the job of administering Connecticut 's tire rationing . It was a new kind of job in plentiful America , and it was a new kind of man , and a new Bowles , that took it . " III A FEW months later , when it became clear that his injured ear was going to keep him out of the Navy , Bowles accepted a promotion to the directorship of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he announced his policy of setting up local three-man boards to represent labor , management , and the consumer , one mayor telephoned to tell him that his city did not contain a " responsible " labor leader . Bowles replied that he understood perfectly the mayor 's dilemma , but for the record would he send him a personal letter stating the fact ? The next day the mayor 's office announced that the three-man board had been appointed . Overnight Connecticut 's OPA began to be a problem to the regional and Washington offices . " Bowles does n't like the fuel oil regulations . " " That fellow in Connecticut is raising hell about the pleasuredriving ban . " " Whatsisname up there says we 're loading the local boards with unnecessary detail . " " This guy Bowles says wc'rc not telling the ' why ' of gas rationing . " " Bowles says he has a better plan . " And he usually did have one . The state administration became a showpiece . Critical Newsweek called it " a lucid chapter in the agency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprised when in the summer of 1943 Bowles was called to Washington by Prentice Brown to replace Lou Maxon as general manager of the national outfit . H E TOOK over an organization which seemed to be in an all-but-hopeless condition . Its staff was demoralized ; its reputation got a little gamier every day ; its operations had bogged down in a dozen spots ; and Congress was baying at its heels like a pack of hound-dogs after a scared rabbit . The trouble had set in at the very beginning of OPA , when Leon Henderson had to hold down prices without the help of any basic law ? by " jaw control , " as he came to call his method . Under the circumstances , his success was little short of miraculous . Many people have forgotten today that the ebullient Henderson saved the government some $26 billion , plus an additional $6 billion for consumers , in those early days of the war . He contrived to stabilize prices and rents , and unquestionably staved off a dangerous inflation . But in order to accomplish these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet aroused to the hazards of runaway prices , Henderson operated with a belligerence and cockiness which in the end were his undoing . Too often he seemed to believe that the whole show could be run from Washington , and apparently he lacked faith in the ability of ordinary citizens ? when they understood what had to be done ? to co-operate and comply . Finally , many of the very people Henderson was protecting came to oppose him . By threatening to withhold all OPA funds , Congress forced Henderson out in November 1942 , and the well-meaning but weak ex-Senator Prentice Brown of Michigan took his place . The worst of Brown 's many mistakes was the appointment of Lou Maxon , an ultra-conservative advertising executive from Detroit , as his right-hand man . Merit appointees in thefield began to lose their jobs , and Democratic congressmen were given to understand that their long-frustrated appetite for OPA patronage might at last be satisfied . Experts were described as " slide-rule boys " and kicked around . Maxon slapped down a proposal for quality control of canned goods through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected to rise . Lobbyists moved in for the kill , By May 1943 , many of the key men in OPA had risen in open revolt ? and in July , after issuing a vitriolic press statement , Maxon resigned . Bowles , who had earlier declined to share the general managership with Maxon , was called to Washington to try to clean up the mess ; and a few months later he took over from Brown the titular , as well as the actual , responsibility for running the agency . W HEN the Coast Guard brought the news of his nomination to Bowles , who was relaxing in his boat off the Maine coast , he knew what had to be done and how to do it . Two jobs were urgent ? to win the confidence of a ravening Congress , and to get public co-operation in holding down prices . First of all , Bowles went to work on Congress . The Senate Banking and Currency Committee , on edge from its bouts with the truculent Henderson , was hardly prepared for the show Bowles presented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been staged just as carefully as any radio program Benton &; Bowles ever produced . He opened at 11 A.M. with a disarming confession of OPA 's unpopularity , the maddening complexity of its regulations , its topheaviness , its lack of experienced businessmen . In passing he remarked that regulating eight million prices in three million businesses , plus keeping direct contact with thirty million housewives and even more automobile drivers , was no cinch . Then , with a sudden change of tone , Bowles showed the senators a chart . It was three feet wide , mounted on a sevenfoot easel , and lettered so that even a Southern Democrat could read it . He gave a few words of explanation and motioned to a clerk , who produced another chartand another and another , until 106 of them had been displayed before the somewhat dazed committee . They demonstrated , beyond any possibility of argument , just what OPA had accomplished ? that prices had risen only 26 per cent during the first 53 months of the war , for example , as compared with the 65 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I. At 4 o'clock the senators crowded forward to congratulate him . The next week they extended the controversial Price Stabilization Act . Through the course of many subsequent hearings , Bowles developed an unsurpassed technique for dealing with congressional committees . His case was always presented with a quiet , good-humored urbanity . He made sure that he had every conceivable fact any congressman was likely to ask for ? presented , whenever possible , in chart form . Even under the most vicious needling , he was never known to lose his temper . Because he did not pretend that OPA was perfect , and did not hesitate to admit his own mistakes , even some of the Republicans came to trust him . Perhaps the most sincere tribute of all came recently from Senator Wherry of Nebraska , a raucous critic of OPA . " You can make a fellow believe anything , " he said ; " I have to eat more vitamins than ever before to resist you . " A smooth personal performance was by no means Bowles ' only technique for soothing rambunctious congressmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick answers to questions . Sometimes the answer was so effective that the legislator merely needed to change the salutation and signature and mail it on to an angry constituent . The staff stood ready to undertake almost any kind of research job for the overworked , understaffed congressmen , who were in real need of the specialized know-how of administrative technicians . Bowles saw a new pattern emerging , through which the long struggle between the Congress and the bureaucracy might be resolved . I N his campaign to win over the public , Bowles relied almost entirely on the idea of voluntary co-operation . You could never hire enough police to control prices , he reasoned ? but you could persuade the people to do the job themselves . Consequently , the local OPA offices were at once given much greater authority , and many of the Washington operations were decentralized . For the first time the language of rationing and prices was made intelligible . Forms were simplified from six pages to a page and a half . A vast program of consultation was developed , to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone , twenty thousand individual consultations took place in a single week : and some six hundred industry , consumer , labor , and farm advisory committees poured in a constant stream of suggestions for improving the agency 's operations . At the same time Bowles did all he could to cushion the yoke of rationing on a public which had never been broken to such a harness . One of his first acts after arriving in Washington was to remove the ban on the use of A-card gas rations for pleasure driving . " Depriving people of the right to use their A-card as they see fit , " he explained , " is like giving a lollipop to a baby and preventing him from sucking it . " And he specifically renounced what had come to be known as the " snooping Gestapo approach " to enforcement of price ceilings and rationing . ( Not that Bowles was n't tough when he had to be : in 1944 alone 333,151 investigations resulted in the nailing of 338,029 violators , and 96 per cent of the cases taken to court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain to all the people why rationing and price control were necessary , and the stake everybody had in making them work . Drawing on his advertising experience , he took to the air . More than two hundred broadcasts a week went out over local stations . His own weekly fifteen-minute network talk , low-keyed and intimate in delivery but factual enough to require seventy man-hours a week in preparation , reached six million listeners according to the Crossley survey . A special staff systematically combed the country 's newspapers for complaints . An editor who distorted the facts would receive a gentle but firm explanation from Bowles himself . When the Chicago Tribune printed an editorial insinuating that Democratic leaders in the city were getting more than their share of gas coupons , Bowles simply wired the local administrator to take all ration books sealed for mailing to the city editor 's desk , and request him to open them and tabulate the results himself . The Tribune never actually admitted that the count showed Republicans were getting slightly more gas ; but it did concede ( inconspicuously ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was dropped . In handling the irascible Washington press corps Bowles displayed an unfailing good humor which gained him much respect . When he announced during his early days in Washington that most meats were going off the ration list but that some might have to be put back later , a reporter in the back of the room said : " But not until after the election , Mr. Bowles ? " Bowles stiffened for a split second , then replied : " You do n't really believe that , do you ? " " Well . . . yes . " " Will you bet twenty dollars , " Bowles asked him , " that some of those meats wo n't go back on the ration list before November ? " " Well .. . no , " the reporter replied , " I guess not , thanks . " And some of the meats did go back on the list . B ol , NrnEs ' advertising experience again proved useful in dealing with the lobbyists . He knew that most of them earn a living by their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , spontaneous wave of public protest ? and that his best defense was simply to expose the way in which such " protests " were manufactured . Late in 1944 , for example , considerable pressure began to develop for an increase in stove prices . Bowles deflated the whole campaign in one evening with a little chat over the Blue Network . He pointed out that it had been organized " by a publicity firm specifically employed by a minority group . . to help raise prices for their already profitable industry . " He then read the publicity firm 's own memorandum outlining the propaganda campaign ? a detailed plan for planting newspaper editorials , influencing financial writers and radio commentators , and preparing a statement to be made by certain university economists . " They are the same economists who later appeared in print uttering the very words prepared for them , " Bowles remarked . He added that the memo had been turned over to him by stove manufacturers who " resented the effort by a small minority to involve the stove industry as a whole in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasion some brewers tried to start a " Write Your Congressman " movement to raise the mark-ups on beer , and the head of their trade association wrote a letter to the members stating : " It is our understanding that OPA will pay more attention to Southern congressmen and senators because they are on the right side politically . " Bowles spiked that drive simply by filing a copy of the letter with the Senate Banking and Currency Committee . By the end of 1945 OPA had become , if not the most popular agency in the country , at least one of the most respected . But the personal qualities of the man who was responsible for this transformation were still unknown to the general public . IV N E X T to courage , stubbornness is perhaps the dominant note in his character . In conference or in a congressional committee witness chair it is sometimes veiled by the notorious Bowles charm ; but it showed up nakedly in the spring of 1940 when he was sailing his own boat home from Bermuda . The party , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends and their wives , a seaman , and a cook . Bowles had made the run before in less than four days ; but this time it was sixteen days before the 71-foot auxiliary schooner Nordlys hove into sight of its Connecticut anchorage , where the children ? there were five of them now ? were waiting , along with the worried Coast Guard , to hear what had happened . A rising gale had blown the vessel 118 miles off course . For five days she lay hove-to with only three sails left standing . Two of the men had been totally submerged while working at the bowsprit , clambering back with the greatest difficulty , and Bowles and the cook had risked being skewered by a broken gaff while they clambered up the swaying mast . While the women sat mending the torn canvas , the party debated whether they should start up the auxiliary motor and use their scant supply of fuel to put into Norfolk , Virginia , rather than continue north with the remnants of their sail . Bowles would n't hear of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own power , " he said , " we 're no good . " The incident of the Bermuda cruise perhaps throws some light on another of Bowles ' characteristics ? a feeling for power which is as much a part of him as it was of Roosevelt . It is a natural and easy , rather than an imposing quality ? an effortless ability to become the focus of any gathering , small or large , to monopolize the talk without raising the voice . A bitter critic of his recent work said : " He 's the world 's greatest optimist , and the world 's greatest selector of facts that agree with some goddam theory . But he 's a force of nature that ca n't be budged . You and I allow ourselves to be swayed by the other side , but Bowles , without letting you see what he 's doing , always comes back to his original point , and wins it . " The critic conceded that Bowles ' willingness to be unpopular for a principle was his greatest strength , but added : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat . " This magisterial compulsion showed up very early in Bowles ' life . He broke his arm twice playing baseball and then gave up the sport rather than play it with a handicap . For a while after college he was convinced that he could go to the top in golf . The National Amateur was to be played that year on his home course in New Jersey and Bowles would go out day after day with a bucket of balls , studying every approach and trap , working out the angles on the difficult holes down to an almost mathematical precision . Perhaps he had overtrained , for he " blew " in the qualifying round , but from that day on his interest in golf was negligible . When he took up sailing , he was not content with lessons from an old salt ; he and " Steb " took a night course in navigation at a New York school . In Washington his friends are astonished at his dedication to prices and markets . The trip downtown in the morning is a miniature staff conference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day are reviewed and new strategy is planned ; after that , two or three hours of homework memorizing figures or a speech are not unusual . He leaves no doubt that he is the head man , not only in title but in his grasp of the task at hand . But his own energies are generally reserved for wrestling with the complexities of policy . The routine of administration , the unpleasant business of shaking up staffs and firing incompetents , was left in OPA almost entirely to his able deputy , James Gamble Rogers , Jr . H ow far these various qualities will take Chester Bowles , it is hard to say . His own ambition is certainly great , and the fervor of those who have worked for him is greater . But he may lack some of the commoner attributes of the master-politician . His opponents in Connecticut say that he is as unpopular with his neighbors in Essex as he is with the political machine regulars . But they point to nothing more specific than the size of the house he built there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house at a beer party which is still remembered ; and at the entrance , in place of the usual " KEEP OUT " sign , there is one pointing to the old beach which used to be public property , reading " PEOPLE ARE WELCOME TO BATHE . " Bowles ' own success in business no doubt accounts for his notable ability to deal with businessmen and use them in the key positions in his organization ; but there is no sign that industry would be any friendlier to a Bowles candidacy for office than it was to Roosevelt 's . During his last month at OPA a facetious friend phoned one day and said , " I was just thinking , Chet , what would happen if you were to drop dead one of these days . " He paused . " The market would go up ten points . " A Connecticut manufacturer admitted that Bowles would have the average consumer of the state behind him ; " but little business , " he said , with some emphasis on the little , " has been badly squeezed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No , he 'd never get started up here . " , A Democratic politician from the state was no more sanguine . " Great guy , Bowles ! He 's done an amazing job in Washington . But up here ? well , it 's the convention that decides , and Bowles is n't even reasonable in taking advice about his appointments . " What neither the businessman nor the politician mentioned was that no other possible candidate but Bowles is given an outside chance of beating the incumbent Republican governor , Raymond E. Baldwin , next fall . O F IDEAS for the larger problems of government , and even plans , there is no lack in Chester Bowles , but he is reluctant to talk of them . " I 've got plenty to do in my present job , " he told his friend Douglas Bennet , the director of Program Planning for OPA , " without trying to be an expert in some other field . " But he did give the core of his political thinking . He is sure that we are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if we can no more than match 1940 production , that will mean a cut of 30 per cent from wartime levels : technological advances since 1940 alone would insure that twenty million unemployed would be walking the streets , or twelve million more than in 1940 . Full production , Bowies continues , is the only answer . " To achieve it we 've got to use our manpower and our resources in peacetime as fully as we used them in war . At 1945 levels of farm and factory prices and at present wage levels , that means 150 billion dollars ' worth of purchasing power ? and 150 billion dollars ' worth of bathtubs , beefsteaks , refrigerators , and decent schools to spend it on . At that level America would buy 60 per cent more food than we ate in 1940 , 72 per cent more clothing , 68 per cent more electrical equipment , 105 per cent more household furniture , 130 per cent more new farm machinery , and three times the number of new homes ! " Bowles voted for Roosevelt four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labormade Bowles invulnerable to the arguments of friends who expected him to change camps in 1940 . ) But he voted for Roosevelt in the belief that the New Deal was a step ? a small step ? in the direction of a full-production economy . With many of the approaches to that goal he differed , and his own methods would not be the same . He believes , for example , in encouraging manufacturers to price their goods at the lowest possible levels , and to depend for their overall profit on high production with a small profit per item He would give special benefits to small business , including credit and research facilities . " The government 's part , " he says , " is to back up our traditional system of free enterprise , guaranteeing the conditions under which that system may work .

He would encourage exports vigorously but at the same time try to eliminate our high tariff tradition : " We ca n't go on exporting indefinitely without taking goods in return . " And finally he would try to work out a program through which labor , management , and farmers would find it as profitable to work together in peace as they had found it expedient during the war years . " But remember , " Bowles says at this point , " I 'm neither a politician nor a permanent government servant ; when my job here is accomplished , be ready to go home . " Whether he wants to become a politician , only Bowles himself really knows . The course of events in Washington , however , makes it appear unlikely that he will soon go home .
