Noonday sun sifted mustily down through the Capitol 's frosted-glass skylights . Up rose two clerks-one in the House , one in the Senate . For 40 minutes they droned away in clear , colorless voices , reading Franklin Roosevelt 's message to the reconvened 78th Congress . The two Congressional audiences were small . But Congressmen who pondered the text found that the President had sent them a confident , meaty almost Churchillian review of the progress of the war . <P> In some 5,500 clear and unvarnished words he hinted at future strategy , stoutly defended his foreign policy , pointed proudly to U.S. production , nodded briefly at a postwar world . <P> " For Mr. Roosevelt , it is an unusual message , " wrote Columnist Raymond Clapper , who has a sharp reporter 's eye in a common-sense head . " Not only is it one of the longest he ever sent to Congress , but it proposes no controversial legislation , is moderate in defense of past actions , and it contains no purple passages . . . . " Mr. Clapper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twice . Mr. Roosevelt actually admitted that " mistakes have been made " in Washington , admissions that from him have the rarity of pearls in restaurant oysters . <P> For the Record . Without dramatics , the President looked at the fighting in Sicily , concluded that the welcome given Allied troops by the Italians boded no good for the Nazis in other occupied territories . Said he : the landing on Italy is not the end ; at Quebec , U.S. and British military leaders made specific plans for other , heavier blows at both Germany and Japan . Definite dates have been set for landings on the continent " and elsewhere . " The heartening news : <P> - By opening up the Donets Basin and the Ukraine , the Soviet Army is doing a magnificent job against the common enemy . But U.S.-British blows are doing more than merely " helping " the Russians . <P> - Campaigns in the Solomons and New Guinea have made a sizable dent in Jap equipment , have furnished the Allies with valuable new bases . The threat to Australia and New Zealand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 ) steady , relentless bombing of Hitler 's ' ' roofless fortress , " 2 ) more help and military supplies to China , 3 ) an offensive in Burma , 4 ) internal unrest in the Axis ' satellite countries . <P> He carefully balanced sober warnings against the good news : " Nothing we can do will be more costly in lives than to adopt the attitude that the war has been won . . . . We are still a long , long way from ultimate victory in any major theater of war . . . " <P> - " German power can still do us great injury . . . . " <P> - " We face in the Orient a long and difficult fight . . . . We must be prepared for heavy losses in winning that fight . . . . "
