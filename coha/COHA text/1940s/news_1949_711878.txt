txt Thirty-three of thirty-five projects operated by the New York City Housing Authority were affected yesterday by a walkout of maintenance workers that threatened to continue well past the week-end . The immediate effects of the work stoppage scarcely were noticeable , and there were no complaints about lack of service from the 37,000 families affected . But union and Authority spokesmen acknowledged that the results of the walkout would be cumulative and that there would be a definite deterioration in cleanliness and repair service if the protest lasted for any long peripd . Heating of the twenty-one permanent developments operated by the Authority in Brooklyn , Queens and Manhattan presented no problem . Automatic oil burners were running smoothly and unattended . // The same situation prevailed at eight temporary veterans ' projects , made up mostly of quonset huts , where tenants tend their own fires , and at four other sites for new projects where the old buildings have not yet been torn down . Only two units retained full maintenance staffs . These were the South Jamaica Houses in Queens and the Edwin Markham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ projects under construction and these were not involved . All the rest were partially or totally affected . The walkout began at 7:30 yesterday morning . It was not officially termed a strike by Local 111 of the United Public Workers , C10 , but rather a " spontaneous protest demonstration . " As a union of public employes , Local 111 comes under the provisions of the state Condon-Wadlin law , which makes strikes by such workers punishable by loss of their jobs . The union reported in the late afternoon that the stoppage was fully effective and said that skeleton crews had been left at every project to maintain all basic services . It said that " every last one of the union 's 1,500 members " was involved . A spokesman for the Authority put the number of strikers at 711 out of a total of 1,067 regular maintenance workers . The following kinds of workers were absent from their jobs : firemen , maintenance men , porters , watchmen , housing assistants , laborers , elevator mechanics , gardeners and office employes . The walkout of white-collar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the other employes 2 Principal Demands Behind the demonstration were two principal demands by the union . One was the request that fireihen and maintenance men receive the $250 bonus granted last July to other city workers , but not to employes of the housing authority . The other was that porters and laborers , for whom no bonus is asked at present , retain their present pay levels when they are placed on civil-service status . The union reported that it was the city 's intention to cut their wages by about $10 a week . Jack Bigel , president of the New ork district of the international union , said the demonstration was aimed not so much at the authority as at city budget officials who , he asserted , were responsible for the financial developments . He expressed the view that if the authority had received the right to resolve the situation , it would have been able to do so " months ago . " Mr. Rigel said that the wages being paid to authority employes were as follows : maintenance men , $1,620 to $2,100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ porters and laborers , $1,200 to $1,500 . In addition , these workers receive a $660 yearly cost-of-living bonus . By late afternoon , with no sign of settlement in sight , Mr. Bigel reported that the walkout might spread to all employes of the authority and that it might continue for an indefinite period . He said that the union might have to yield to rank-and-file pressure and pull skeleton crews off the projects . " I assume our guys will continue their present course of action until they have had an opportunity to meet , talk and discuss this situation one way or another and then decide what to do , " he said . " But there are no meetings scheduled ' for this week-end . The first one is set for Monday , and the protest may continue beyond then . " At the offices of the housing authority , 63 Park Row , where officials earlier were confident that the demonstration would be over by the end of the day , the feeling of optimism had been replaced by gloom in the afternoon . Spokesmen made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a somewhat longer walkout . The picketing of the projects was described by the police as spirited but without incident At the John Lovejoy Elliot Houses in the Chelser ... section of Manhattan , a scattering of women tenants joined the marchers . Another group of tenants , organized in the New York Tenants Councils on Rent and Housing , sent a telegram to Mayor O'Dwyer urging that the demands of the strikers be met . There were no negotiations between officials of the union and the authority . At 5 o'clock yesterday afternoon Mr. Bigel and a delegation of ten union members entered the office of Philip Cruise , secretary of the authority , and asked : " Is there any nhange in the negotiation situation ? " " No , " replied Mr. Cruise . The group left without further word .
