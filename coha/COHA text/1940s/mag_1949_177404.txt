Back from the wild blue yonder , thousands of veterans jumped into the air transport business after the war . All they needed to set themselves up as irregular nonscheduled airlines was a little capital , some flying know-how , and one or more surplus planes , which the War Assets Administration was eager to sell them cheap . Some of them crashed , and some went broke . But about no nonscheduled lines have been doing well enough with cargo and air-coach services to throw a scare into the big , scheduled airlines . <P> Last week the Civil Aeronautics Board , prodded by the big carriers , announced that it would ground the nonskeds as of June 20 . After that , any " large " irregular carrier ( i.e. , flying any airplane heavier than 10,000 Ibs. ) would have to have CAB 's permission to stay in business . In granting permits , CAB would hold the nonskeds accountable for such past sins as flying on what amounted to regular schedules , and thus , according to scheduled airlines , taking business away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stick to irregular charter service . <P> CAB had a tough problem . It had to look out for the well-being of the regular airlines , and the taxpayer who subsidized them , but it also had a duty not to stifle the free , enterprising spirit in which the nonskeds had been born . <P> No Frills . That spirit was typified by-among others-Air America , Inc. of San Pedro , Calif. , founded last year by 34-year-old , Austrian-born Fred Miller . A civilian personnel director for the Army Air Forces , Miller joined the Flying Tigers cargo airline after the war and saved $15,000 . This was enough to rent four DC-45 and start flying the lucrative Los Angeles-New York route last July . Flying 20 round trips a month at cut-rate fares of $99 ( $58.85 under scheduled lines ) , Air America had carried 11,270 passengers by the end of the year . It had grossed $1,600,000 and netted a tidy $41,000 . Miller did it by using 60 seats in his planes instead of the usual 44 . He served no meals , put no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in the air . <P> Fred Miller has already applied to CAB for certification as an air-coach operator . Whether he gets it or not , the new rule is not likely to be a death sentence to Air America. ; Miller can always retreat to some intrastate route , out of CAB 's reach . But CAB 's crackdown might kill off more than half the irregulars . <P> Chloroform . The airline industry might find it could not afford to lose them all . The nonskeds had tapped a new market by making air travel cheap enough to lure bus and rail-coach riders who never flew before . If some of the irregulars had irregular safety records , they had also proved to the scheduled airlines that they could fill their planes by cutting frills and fares . Nevertheless , many scheduled airlines still agreed with ex-CAB Chairman James M , Landis that the U.S. was cluttered with too many airlines . " An intrinsically weak airline , " he told a Senate committee last week , " either should be chloroformed or absorbed by some other airline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would go easy with the chloroform . <P> Last week , with a grumbling reluctance about signing " a blank check which private airline management may fill in , "
