" The greatest of all the bottlenecks in Washington , " said Pundit Walter Lippmann last week , " is the bottleneck at the White House . " <P> Primary cause of the disease , said Dr. Lippmann , is the obstructionism of Congress . Unlimited debate in the Senate can be shut off only by a two-thirds vote . This is a valuable rule , but its abuse in a period of emergency may force the U.S. , to all intents &; purposes , to get along without Congress . The President then has to get things done by proclamation , by persuasion , by the use of his prestige , by indirection , subterfuge , circumvention . How to save Congress ? Said Lippmann : by a gentleman 's agreement to abandon the filibuster on questions of national defense and foreign policy during the emergency . " All that is required is that Senator Wheeler and Senator Nye and two or three others agree to debate their views on the floor of the Senate and then-without filibustering ... let the Senate vote on the question . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work with Congress was his handling last week of the " draft property " bill , dubbed by Washington the " seize-send " bill for its sweeping provisions . The bill gave the President the right to take over permanently or temporarily any property of any kind which could be used to further national defense . ( Compensation would be fixed by the President ; an owner could sue , if displeased , would be paid 75% of the President 's price , pending the outcome of the suit . ) <P> Said Republican House Leader Joe Martin : " The Administration wants the power to take the watch out of your pocket . " <P> Said California 's Senator Johnson : " It 's the damnedest piece of legislation I have ever seen . " <P> President Roosevelt said he had not read the bill before it was submitted , thought its language too broad , indicated that he had primarily wanted a measure to deal with strike-bound plants . He talked long with leaders of Congress , and Administration spokesmen announced that the bill would be greatly modified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President also : <P> &gt; Let it be known that he was dropping many a routine duty , delegating authority in order to deal more with major defense problems and war policies . <P> &gt; Sent a message to Congress , urging immediate development of his old pet , the St. Lawrence seaway and power project , in spite of the fact that it would now have to compete for labor and materials with defense industries . Said he : " The enemies of democracy are developing hydro-electric resource and every waterway from Norway to the Dardanelles . Are we to allow this continent to be outmatched ? . . . Your action on this project will either make available or withhold 2,200,000 horsepower of low-cost electric power for the joint defense of North America . . . . " <P> &gt; Signed the ship-seizure bill that authorized the Government to take over and operate foreign ships laid up in U.S. ports ( see p. 20 ) . Immediately the Emergency Shipping Division of the Maritime Commission announced that it was ready to requisition 84 vessels , would allocate them " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of national defense .
