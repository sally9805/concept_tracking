One of the few nettles in the primrose path of James Caesar Petrillo has been the National Music Camp at Interlochen ( Mich. ) , where more than 600 boys &; girls study orchestra and composition every summer . Three years ago , swarthy , owl-eyed Musicians ' Union Boss Petrillo decided that the ten-to 18-year-old musicians ( too young to pay union dues ) were " nonprofessional " ; he stopped their weekly broadcasts over NBC . Gentle-mannered Dr. Joseph Edgar Maddy , Interlochen director and a union member for 36 years , switched the concerts to Michigan 's noncommercial , state-owned station WKAR . <P> Frustrated Petrillo kept squirming until he hit upon an idea : put Interlochen on his " unfair list " and threaten its instructors with union suspension ( TIME , Feb. 19 ) . Dr. Maddy countered by employing college teachers and composers who , not dependent upon instrumental jobs , are not alarmed by Petrillo 's threat . Last week he opened the camp as usual , said nonchalantly : " Now it 's up to Petrillo . Actually he does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on with our work . "
