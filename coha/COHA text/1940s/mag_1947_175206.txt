In their beaverboard office in the basement of a Government building in La Boca , five dark-skinned men sat back and mopped their brows with satisfaction . They were the officers of Local 713 , United Public Workers of America ( C.I.O. ) , and they had just signed up their 15,897th dues payer . This meant that most of the men now working on the Panama Canal belong to a union dominated by Communists . <P> Less than a year ago the only unions in the Zone worth mentioning were the A.F.L. affiliates , to which most of the 5,000 U.S.-born workers belonged . Then ' the U.P.W.A. saw its chance , and sent organizers among the Canal Zone 's 25,000 Panamanian and West Indian employees , most of whom lived in crowded slums across the fence in Panama . They found a Communist 's dream . Ready for their exploiting was one of the worst examples of racial discrimination extant anywhere , and it was sanctioned by the U.S. Government . <P> When the U.S. went south in 1904 to dig the big ditch it took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid in gold currency ; locally recruited labor , mainly Jamaican Negroes , were paid in silver . Those on the gold roll shopped at " gold " commissaries ; those on the silver roll went to others marked " silver . " Drinking fountains labeled gold and silver stood side by side . At the post-office were two separate wickets . The system went farther : the few Negroes on the gold roll would never have dreamed of sending their children to the superior gold schools , though theoretically they had that right . Worst of all , it was practically impossible to move from the low-paid silver list to the privileged gold roll . After 43 years there are exactly 54 Panamanians on the gold roll . <P> " Throw Them Out . " With such a ready-made situation , Local 713 's membership snowballed . Army officials , alarmed by U.P.W.A. 's growth and embarrassed by the old Jim Crow system , were ready to meet the union 's demands , at least half way . By last week the union claimed these gains : 1 ) removal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; 2 ) an order admitting Panamanians to equal terms in civil service exams ; 3 ) hourly wage hikes of 2 to 6 ; 4 ) a 40-hour week ; 5 ) improved vacation privileges ; 6 ) more overtime pay . <P> Quite obviously , this strengthened U.P.W.A. in the Canal Zone . It also raised the question of the influence that U.P.W.A. 's President Abram Flaxer and other Communist-wired leaders exert in the Zone . Not all Local 713 's members would fall for it . The Local 's secretary-treasurer , Edward Gasking , a Negro schoolteacher , said that if the union 's U.S. leaders urged action hostile to Canal Zone interests , " we 'd throw them bodily out . " <P> But last week Max Brodsky , a trusted Flaxer staffman , arrived in Panama to help run U.P.W.A. 's membership drive . And there were reports that Communists were buying Panamanian citizenship so as to qualify for civil service jobs on locks and docks . In Washington , a Senate subcommittee headed by Minnesota 's Ed Thye got ready to investigate the whole situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
