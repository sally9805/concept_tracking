All over China people suddenly seemed to realize that the elections were just around the corner . Interior Minister Chang Li-sheng calculated that 150,000,000 Chinese were eligible to vote . Nobody had any hard figures on the number of candidates , but in the polls of Nov. 21 and Dec. 21 , some 4,000 delegates would have to be elected to China 's National Assembly and its Legislative Yuan . Constitutional government was being inaugurated on schedule . Last week , China , just like Western models , had ward heelers , slush funds , wire pullers , whispering campaigns , vested interests and a sprinkling of high-minded amateurs . <P> " Do n't Be Silly . " Office seekers worked out their own electoral techniques . Nanking noted with special interest the race of the Misses Liu , Li and Shen for a seat in the Yuan . Gossiped China News : " Miss Liu has been telling people , in an offhand manner , ' Oh , by the way , do you know that Miss Li long ago said she is not interested in running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Do n't be silly-of course I 'm interested . ' " <P> Miss Li masterfully avoided censure when a Chinese reporter came for an interview , learned she was still abed at 10 a.m . " I only stayed in bed to read , " she explained . " Reading what ? " quizzed the reporter . " Why , " said the candidate , " the Constitution . " <P> Miss Shen 's tactics seemed even more cunning . Said she : " I definitely have no intention of running . How could I , who have neither money nor power , time nor leisure , compete with the others ? " Miss Shen said she would rather nurse wounded soldiers . Naturally , with the soldiers ' vote to think of , that sort of campaigning worried rivals . <P> " Illiterates Are Legion . " In the Social Democratic Rebirth Weekly , Writer Tu Jen feared that his countrymen lacked political intelligence : " When I look closely into realities , I feel that the forthcoming elections are but a beautiful dream . . . . Illiterates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ democratic government is are indeed very few . . . . " <P> There were , however , plenty of signs that the democratic process in China , while not perhaps as up-to-date as that of Kansas City , was not wholly different from it . When the Kuomintang announced this week its list for the Legislative Yuan , old-guard members who were not up for renomination let out a howl of protest . They had fed so long and faithfully at the public trough-and was this to be their reward ? <P> Cried Chen Yang-piao : " In Fukien if I am not the No. 1 candidate , I surely am the No. 2 . Why am I not on the list ? " Teng Kung-hsien pounded the speaker 's table as though squashing injustice . " We have been on the wrong road ! Why belong to the Kuomintang after all ? " <P> <P> But such fickleness was scorned by Chen Chih-fong . He was disgruntled , but he staunchly said : " We must struggle within the party ranks . When we are alive we must live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kuomintang ghosts . " <P> Miss Chang Yulin held out the ultimate threat : " If I fail , I shall reveal all the secrets of the elections . "
