The party lasted until 2 a.m. , and the walls of Oslo 's 13th Century Akershus Fortress reverberated with laughter and deep-throated Scandinavian singing . The guests - 97 ministers , generals , diplomats and politicians of Sweden , Denmark and Norway-toasted each other and their countries . Gay as any was the host , Norway 's Foreign Minister Halvard Lange . Yet in his pocket crackled a crisp piece of paper , a note from Soviet Russia . The Soviet ambassador had delivered it just as Lange was leaving for the state dinner . <P> Next morning the guests learned what Lange had known all during the party-that Russia had peremptorily questioned Norway about her joining the proposed North Atlantic Defense Pact , in effect had warned her to stay out of it . Scandinavia 's period of fence-sitting was coming to a close . <P> Treading Water . Halvard Lange would need courage and the ability to keep his feet on the ground if he were to cope with the U.S.S.R. He showed he had both when , the morning after the party , he wiped the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoke-filled Oslo officers ' club beneath a foot-high wall inscription of the Norwegian kings ' motto , " Alt for Norge " ( All for Norway ) , Lange voiced his final no to the Swedish-Danish suggestion of a Scandinavian neutrality bloc . <P> The plan was Sweden's-a slight retreat from her long isolation and neutrality . The idea was that the three countries would arm as a unit , with the U.S. giving them the arms . They would thus be not quite in the same boat with the Atlantic-pact West , but would be hanging onto the gunwale , treading water . <P> With Norway 's rejection , the plan collapsed . The three Nordic powers parted in their usual good spirits , agreeing to disagree , and still bound by old and tough ties . Lange 's persistent refusal , after months of parleying , had won the admiration of his fellow Scandinavians . " This man has more stamina than a buffalo , " sighed a Swede . <P> Two Foolscap Sheets . Next day Halvard Lange discussed the Soviet note with Norway 's cabinet . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Russia-a 122-mile strip on the Arctic tip of the Scandinavian peninsula . It asserted that the proposed Atlantic pact was an attempt by the U.S. and Britain to dominate the world . It asked Norway whether she was going to furnish the West with " air force or naval bases . " <P> Lange went to his home behind the royal castle , relaxed in an easy chair , and drafted the reply in longhand on two foolscap sheets . He submitted it to Premier Einar Gerhardsen ( his cellmate during the war in the Nazis ' Sachsenhausen concentration camp ) , and to the foreign affairs committee of the Storting ( Parliament ) . <P> In the dark-walled committee room , a Conservative member , often a stern critic of Lange 's Laborite policies , huffed : " Could n't be better ; do n't alter one word . " A few words were altered . The reply was delivered at the Soviet embassy 71 hours after the protest had been received . <P> The reply was courageous , and it kept Norway 's feet on the ground . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for joining the Atlantic pact , that she would not grant bases to foreign powers unless attacked " or subjected to threats of attack .
