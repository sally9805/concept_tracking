ANNA AND THE EMPEROR WALTZ A Story NEIL S. BOARDMAN W ELL , they 're gone , cleared out early this P.M. , and that 's perfectly O. K. with me . Small town society bores me anyhow ; I guess ten years in the City does something to a woman , broadens her , makes her see things in a bigger way . At least they ca n't make any more cracks about my housekeeping , the way Mrs. Rolstead did to Mrs. Kirkwood the day she popped in on me unexpected . The old dump may not have many trimmings but it was neat as a whistle today . All the same the remark about the phonograph record was the sort of thing that gets me down on these small town dames , it was not only ill-bred , it was absolutely uncultivated . " Oh , Mrs. Helvig , whatever do you do with your time ? " And while I splutter like a ninny Lydia Rolstead gets in her punch . " Why , she plays that record . " That record . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she care if I do play it every once in awhile ? I guess she can close her windows if she does n't want to listen ; that kid of hers has got a record in his larynx that the whole neighborhood knows by heart . But I could tell by the look on the assembled faces that the subject had been mentioned before when I was n't around . So a little thing like that has become common gossip . I can just hear ' em . While her husband slaves away at the shop she sits around the house playing the phonograph , they say . Why does n't she play the radio ? You can do your housework and play the radio at the same time , they say . " What is this record ? " Mrs. Trillberry remarks , casual as the devil 's wife . " Oh , something very highbrow , " answers Emily Kirkwood , giggling . " Mrs. Helvig goes in for classical music , you know . " Well , that let out their long suit , you might say . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poison to them , nothing but rat poison . " I Wonder , I Wonder , I Wonder , " they sing over and over again , but that 's all right , that 's just their style . " Let 's hear your record , dear , " says Mrs. Trillberry , politely . That 's where I turn on the ice and I guess they feel the freeze . " Why , what record ? " I says . " The one you like so well , " says Mrs. Trillberry . " I do n't know what you mean , " I says . " ' The Beautiful Blue Danube , ' " says Mrs. Rolstead , showing her ignorance up to her hips . " You mean ' The Emperor Waltz ' ? " I says , letting her have it . " Oh , yes , that 's it , " beams Mrs. Rol-stead , not knowing " The Emperor Waltz " from " Home on the Range . " " Oh , " remarks Mrs. Kirkwood , " I heard that in The Great Waltz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's exactly how ignorant they are ANNA AND THE about classical music . But I play the record for them . I get it out of the cabinet and when they see how carefully I handle it , not knowing it 's a Red Seal and the Philadelphia Orchestra or what the hell the Philadelphia Orchestra is anyhow , they are much amused . I do n't know why I play it for them because judging by the way they talk they 've heard it a million times over the picket fence , but I can stand it better than they can , so I play it . And so they gab all through the music and do n't hear any of it , but I give ' ern both sides , and toward the end of the second part they grow still a minute , even their dull emotions being affected , and then I guess they see my face and they are startled because I always did wear my soul Iike rouge on my cheeks and that slow sad part just before the smashing climax raises the goose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arc that much more amused , and they eat my doughnuts and drink my coffee and they say , You ought to join our club and be on the music committee  --  oh , my God ! W LL , they 're gone , but I bet like little cherubs they are hovering about to find out if / play it again before Tom comes home but I 'm damned if I will , though it sounded so nice while they were babbling my appetite 's sort of whetted and I could go the kind of a cry the music would wring out of me if I only wanted to let myself go . But that was a good one , all right . " Why , she plays that record ! " The small-minded bitches . I will play it again . I 'll open all the windows and put the tone up full and let ' em have it . If it were n't for Tom , I would . He ca n't stand their poking fun , though ; poor Tom does n't understand , he thinks people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will play it once more , and now that I think of it , I do hit that record pretty hard , but I never thought of it before , it 's like drink , I guess , only cheaper , and what the hell harm does it do ? It 's funny how I can think back and back and not discover for myself why this piece gets me so . I can play " Are You Lonesome Tonight ? " and feel pleasantly sick inside because it recalls how Eddie Brenner used to take me to dance at that little speakeasy back in Plainview . I think Prohibition days were very lovely . Or if I hear " Rock of Ages " I get washy-eyed seeing Ma at the tubs on hot summer days and remembering how softly she used to sing " Rock of Ages , " and me slopping around in the rinse till she chased me out saying , " Be of Sin the double cure , Save from wrath Annie get out of that or I 'll slap your behind and make me pure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Poet and Peasant Overture " makes me think of the cute little conductor at the Capitol Theater Orchestra / had a crush on when I was fifteen , though of course he never knew it ; and " I 'll See You Again at the Masquerade " reminds me of Tom when I first went out with him before we broke up before we made up again and finally got married . But the more classical stuff , like " Macushia " and " Sylvia , " gives me a real lift , because they sang those pieces and played the " Andante Cantabile " at the Blue Parrot when I was stepping out with the Third Avenue bunch and really hitting things up high with Tony Caspara and having him lay out carpets in front of me a yard wide . He was the only man could say Annie Gunnarson and make it sound like a real name , like the name of somebody that was important and beautiful ; and when I told him it was a dumb Swede name he always said , " Greta Garbo is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loveliest woman in the world . " " How do you know that ? " I would say , smiling , and he would say , " I 've met Garbo . " Well , of course he never met Garbo and he never took me to Hollywood or fixed me up with a car or bought me an evening wrap or married me or did any of the hundred other things I wanted then so badly I 'd have given my soul and did give my soul almost you might say to have ; but he gave me something , / ca n't name it , something that put me in touch with Life and made me see big visions and understand that Annie Gunnarson had potentialities that maybe she was getting too old to realize . That 's the awful thing about growing old , I was nearly thirty then and that 's too late for a girl to realize her potentialities ; but Tony the dirty rat was a swell fellow even if he did break my heart and scare the daylights out of me God I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the chance now I 'd know how to act I bet . At least I 'd know that Torn would probably wait another five years and I would n't have to tie down to him until I was sure I was only a Gunnar-son after all . Not that I have a word against Tom , he tries so hard to understand me and to do what I want but what can Tom do without an education besides make money at the shop and thank God that 's something , and when we have our bills paid we 'll save money and Tom says I 'm not too old even now to take lessons and he 'll buy me the beautiful things I want and we 'll go to the City and after all , Life Begins at Forty , as Dale Carnegie says . And I 'll buy a dozen recordings of " The Emperor Waltz " and crack ' ern all and ship ' em to the old gals in this town vegetating between " I Wonder " and " Brighten the Corner Where You Are . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play it a thousand times , I 'll play it ten thousand times more ! It hits something inside that 's deeper and bigger than their whole town and music committee and county put together . I do n't know what it brings back to me , it does n't bring back anything but when I hear it a great sickness comes over me because in that record are all the things I dreamed about when I was a child and a young girl and a woman so dangerously close to thirty ; all I wanted to be and have , alI the greatness that my miserable little warped soul could have possessed . God Almighty , it is n't what we 've been but what we have n't been and have wanted with all the guts we have that tears us to shreds , that makes our flesh cold and our tongue dry and makes us feel that we 've got to meet it somehow , somewhere , if no place else than in the strains of a great waltz ; and sometimes I almost fall down on the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Strauss because somehow fifty or a hundred years ago away off in Vienna he understood the secret private life of Anna Gunnarson Helvig . NaN sometimes I see big halls full of dancing couples , the men in colored frock coats and the women in great skirts ; but I am not there . And sometimes I see a long procession marching down the old streets of Vienna , with the flags out and the soldiers in uniform , and the white horses and the plumes and the Emperor himself : but I am not there . And sometimes I see a little garden full of roses , and a handsome man who is handsomer than Tony Caspara and almost as kind as poor Tom but he is neither Tony nor Tom , he is somebody bigger than either of them or both of them , and he is at the feet of a beautiful woman , more beautiful than Garbo , and they have all their life before them and that life is beautiful and good and there is no smallness or meanness in it : but I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only I know this , that I am not she . But when the music rises higher and higher and the main big theme comes in then I am dancing in the hall , the whole center of attraction ; and I am in the parade , riding on a black mare beside the Emperor ; and I am the lady lovelier than Garbo , sitting in the garden with him at my feet , watching the petals of roses fall soft to the ground . Then the music changes , it is more sober and sweet , and Vienna fades away , I am Annie Gunnarson again but I am not a housewife in a small town with Tom slaving away to pay up our debts , I am not visited by small-minded neighbors , but I am mingling with people of Culture and Tom is somehow not Tom but is witty and gay and no longer broken by life but still he is my sweet kind husband and we are happy , and I know that this is really the life for me , the life I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low sad strains of the violins steal in just before the record ends , and I know that none of these things will ever be . I know that Vienna is gone forever and even if it were not gone I should not be there . That the world is staggering and Tom is lucky just to have a good job . That I am in this hole of a place for years to come . That no matter what happens I am old , old , a woman past forty with nothing but Tom and a house full of dusty furniture and dirty clothes waiting for me ; and yet the music says , Be brave , be brave , your sadness is beautiful and I am beautiful and we are together and we live forever in remembrance , not of what once was but of what might have been but never will be ! And the music ends with a crash of horns and leaves me empty and cold and life to me is like the low irregular hum of the needle in the groove at the center of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they can not stop me , they do not understand and it is my secret , even from Tom , oh , my God , here he cdmes up the walk , plodding along like a farmer expecting his supper ; heavens , I forgot to get eggs today , have to borrow four from Mrs. Rolstead . I suppose have to listen to news broadcasts all evening on the radio but I do n't care , he 'll go to bed early and be off at six in the morning and then I can do up the breakfast dishes and when the last cup is put away ril sit down in the living room and damn them I 'll play it again . Da Cap SYLVIA STALLINGS H ERE by the shallow river where thin fires burn And the charred grass sourly smells ; Here , now , with half of the forest still to turn Parched gold , and Pennsylvania wells Lower than the oldest farmer can remember ; here the worn Summer still prolongs her spells . We have heard October coming ; we have expected his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On frostless hillsides , sumac thickets Hang bunting out in scarlet folds And the shrill fifing of a regiment of crickets Cavils and scolds . Yet the charmed day lingers : Michaelmas daisies stand In the dry canal-bed , and rotting locks Hang from red hinges that no keeper 's hand Has turned for fifty years , while mallard ducks Scoop in the mud where river-silt and sand Hide the long bones of barges ' hulks . Noon flavored with cider settles over the stone Granaries and the barns washed white with chalk ; High noon walks through the orchards alone Twisting from their stalk Sweet windfalls and yellow pears grown From long ripening to a skin like silk . Dissension sleeps . The river coiling down To doubtful oceans finds all still In the cobbled streets , and slips below the town Unchallenged , feeling its way along the fill Drowsily , too slow to drown Or even turn the mill .
