txt // 4 . Religion as Self-development. ? Self-development is sometimes presented as the essential part of religion . Development of character ' is another phrase for this concept . The concept , in whatever terms it is presented , is a nebulous one , as nebulous as the concept of personality ' that has of recent years become fashionable in pseudopsychological circles . I do not know whether any serious attempt has been made to define religion in terms of personality , but certainly a lot of loose talk about personality and its religious importance seems to have crept into popular discourses on religion . The term self-development , ' like the term personality , ' covers a multitude of sins . Often , it is merely another name for morality or for the living of a progressively more moral life . Religion , as self-development or character development in this sense of terms , is merely religion identified with ethics , which we have considered briefly and must consider further before we are through . There is , however , another slant to the self-development concept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of soul , ' and the development is the saving ' of the soul . When religion is presented in this way , it is an intensely selfish thing . In the extreme form , religion has been urged on man , or certain forms of religion have been urged , as a means of saving his own little soul from hell or ensuring its entrance into heaven . This appeal to pure selfishness has been prominent in Christianity since the second century at least , although it is significantly absent from the teachings of Jesus as reported in the synoptic gospels . Morality , as well as worship and other rituals , have been recommended as means to selfish ends . Oiie is bidden to do good works , to be just , kind , generous , not because these things are worthy ends in themselves , but because , by doing them , one gains merit for oneself , saves one 's own soul . Whether this sort of selfish seeking is more noble ( or less ignoble ) than conforming to religious rules for the money there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helps one 's business has been doubted by many ; but the evaluation of different forms of selfishness is not an important matter for us at this point . It is merely necessary to note well that religion actually has been conceived in terms of selfseeking as its essential feature . Archer brands Plato 's definition of religion as one of the lowest in type . Plato said that religion is merely wanting something from the gods and taking what steps one supposes will be successful // to get it from them . We shall have occasion to notice later that in religion man wants many things , if not exactly from gods , at least from some power ' that can supply these wanted things . Plato was not defining an ideal or admirable religion but was describing religion as it actually appeared ; and Plato was not so far wrong as Archer seems to think . The self-development or self-preservation or self-advancement we are speaking of is one particular item of benefit that some modern groups of religious people seem to make paramount . It does not appear that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as is held by these groups . 5 . Animism As the Basis for Religion. ? The Latin word for life is anima , which means life ' in the physiological sense , that is , the zoological sense , since this second term is derived from the Greek zoe , which meant life considered as a process and which was distinguished from psyche . We might expect , therefore , to find that the word animism ' applies to a doctrine in which life is made fundamental or basic , but that is not what the word means . The Latin word anima meant literally breath ' and was applied to the life process because it is evident that life is dependent on breathing . Later , anima came to mean a daimon , or a soul ' of some sort ; and eventually it designated the soul invented by Plato by combining the old life principle called the psyche with the ego , or subject of conscious experience for which Homer 's term was thumos , and perhaps with the ghost . The theory of animism , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that primitive ' man endowed not only the lower animals , but also inanimate objects , with a soul of one of the several sorts attributed to human beings . Sometimes it is implied that the soul so ascribed is the Platonic soul , or at least a life soul ? an implication that makes inanimate objects really animate . This soul ascribed to animals and objects is often called a spirit , ' which does not change the implication , since spirit derives from the Latin word spiritus , another name for breath . The spirit or soul that is involved in animism is a personal entity , which has the human characteristics of perception , feeling , and thought and which further is capable of action , producing effects iii the physical world . This indwelling entity is sometimes designated simply as the indweller , ' but this term is as ambiguous as is the word soul ; for there are indwellers of various sorts in the folklores // of different cultural groups . At any rate , those who hold to the animism theory of the origin of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a personal entity to animals , plants , and objects commonly classed as inanimate . That savages do personify objects and organisms , and that our cultural ancestors personified them , is true . Children today are given to personifying objects and animals , although we can not assume that a child would personify an object if the personification were not suggested by an adult . Ancient peoples personified rocks , springs , rivers , and mountains ; they personified the thunder and the lightning , the winds and the rain . Eventually they personified abstractions , such as victory and justice . A long process of religious development , however , preceded these personifications . The doctrine that religion developed out of animism is clearly a product of the pseudo-anthropology which assumed that savages are primitive in the literal meaning of the term ; that their ideas and their cultures present the aspect of man at or near the beginning of human development . When we grasp the fact that the savage cultures have gone through a process of development as long as that through which civilization has gone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today assumes that any savage culture represents a stage in the development through which our culture has passed , any more than a psychologist would assume that a child of inferior mentality represents a stage in the development of a normal individual . Savage cultures may have developed from the same primitive conditions from which civilization developed , but the savage cultures have developed differently . That the notion of an indwelling spirit , or soul , in the human being is a comparatively late development is evident from , the stages of development of our own cultural ancestors . Religion , it seems clear , began its development long before this notion of a personified appurtenance was achieved . It seems probable , moreover , that a certain stage in religious development must be reached before the notion of a soul or spirit is possible . Religion has , in many cases , involved the personification of animals and inanimate objects , although modern religion is free from such personifications . Personification , however , is about the most unlikely factor to call upon as the foundation of religion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when other explanatory factors elude him , contradicts the animism doctrine in his explanations of totemism , for he points out that the totem animal is at first not any individual animal , but the whole species . That the early totemists personified the animal species as a species is a notion that Reinach would be the first to say is preposterous . CHAPTER III CONCEPTS INVOLVED IN RELIGION In Chaps . I and II we have discussed certain concepts that have been elaborated by scholars and applied by them to religion in the attempt to define it or to explain it . Those concepts are not necessarily formed or adopted by the adherents of any religion . A person may have faith without forming the concept of faith or attempting to discover what faith is . He may engage in ritual , with no concept of ritual . He may be restrained by tabus , while having no conception of the nature of the tabus . In fact , both in religion and in secular life , the average person is carrying on his processes of thought and action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applied to his performances . Those concepts are comparable to the concept of gravitation , which a mechanic does not need to consider in his practical work , although he deals with phenomena that may properly be subsumed under it . There are , on the other hand , certain concepts which develop in religion , or in most religions , and which are employed by the religious person . It is true that these concepts have been elaborated and clarified by scholars , but they still represent the crude notions of the ordinary religious person . They may be concepts that he accepts as valid , or they may be concepts that he rejects ; but in either case , he employs them in his thinking . These concepts are , for the most part , confused notions , and scholars have not completely clarified them . Our task is to examine them and attempt to put them in order . Concepts that occur in different religions may have different forms in these religions . Such concepts , accordingly , are aids to the comparison of different religions , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that have been presented are often in terms of one or more of these concepts , and the definitions depend on the relative emphasis placed on the concepts explicitly or implicitly . The study of the evolution of religion is , in part , the study of the origins and the modifications of these concepts . 54 // gious belief . This point will be elaborated in the following section , to which it properly belongs . 2 . Concepts of the Cosmos. ? If a god is conceived , not as a personal being , but as an impersonal force or system of laws , or principle of reality underlying the universe , religion based on that concept ipso facto involves a cosmic principle , or power , which to some extent explains or appears to explain the operations of nature . Religions that involve personal gods , or a personal god , usually involve beliefs about the nature of the world , the secrets of its operations , and its beginnings . Orthodox Christianity and Judaism , for example , hold that the world is not only regulated and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Him . In ancient Greek religion , on the contrary , the cosmos , or total universe , is primary , and in the process of its evolution gods appear and flourish , and eventually these disappear and new gods take their places . Although Zeus ' and other gods of the classical era had power to control nature , they were themselves subordinate to the great plan or logos of the universe . In orthodox Hindu religions , Brahma , the impersonal and divine world principle , is eternal , the other and personal gods having developed from the eternal nature of the universe and being subordinate to it . While there may have been religions that involved no conceptions of the nature of the cosmos , it is difficult to find them . On this account , there have been definitions of religion in terms of conceptions of law and order in the universe . Man , it is supposed , for practical reasons or on account of mere curiosity , attempts to understand the world , its principles of operation , and the laws governing its changing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universe , or its outstanding features , such as the weather and the growth of animals and plants , is said to be religion . ' Some scholars , on the other hand , have attempted to exclude beliefs about nature , and natural law , from religion , classing beliefs of this order under the headings of mythological or magical beliefs , or as philosophy , or as scientific hypotheses . It is obvious that an attempt to define religion in terms of beliefs about natural law , or of investigations into causal relationships in nature , leaves no distinction between religion , magic , philosophy , and science and is , therefore , useless . On the other hand , it would seem quite unjustifiable to decide arbitrarily that these conceptions of the nature and origin of the universe , and of its operations , which we find so widely // embedded in religions , are extraneous factors and not actually features of the religions in which they occur . 3 . The Concept of Daimons. ? Our word daimon ' is a transliteration of the Greek word that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a spirit , ' but with less precision , as the latter often implies a life principle or else an aeriform implication . The term daimon applies properly to a supernatural person ( supernatural from our modern point of view ) , who is below the rank of divinity . Daimons are supposed to have an integrated conscious life , which includes perceptions , thoughts , feelings , purposes , and memory . In these respects , daimons are similar to human persons , but they possess certain characteristics that human beings do not . The daimon , for example , is invisible and can penetrate into a material object without displacing any part of the object . These daimons ( the plural form daimonen ' is also used ) are not necessarily souls , ' although some kinds of souls are included under the term . In various religions , the daimons are classified in several categories , in accordance with the powers and other characteristics attributed to them . In Christianity , the daimons fall usually into three classes : angels , human souls , and demons or devils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to these three classes , a class of jinn ( singular , jinni ) , who are further subclassified . The term jinn is sometimes used to include angels and devils , but the usage does not seem authentic . Angels are usually assumed to be good daimons , that is , to be favorably disposed toward men . Devils are always supposed to be bad daimons ? to be inimical toward men . In Greek mythology , as systematized by Hesiod , there was no clear division of daimons into good and bad , but some were more benevolent , or less malevolent , than others , while some had no contacts with the human race and presumably no attitudes toward human beings . In the conceptions of Islam , and of orthodox Christianity , there are angels of high rank ( archangels ) and , subordinate to these , angels of one or more lower ranks . In ancient Syrian and Babylonian religions , and in the Hebrew mythology , there were angels ( or good daimons ) , or several grades . Devils also are commonly assumed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chief devil , down to the minor devils called imps . ' I n Greek usage , the term daimon was sometimes extended to include the gods and goddesses , just as Christians sometimes say , 6o RELIGION : ITS FUNCTIONS IN HUMAN LIFE " God is a spirit . " On this account , translators of Greek writings often render the word daimon as god ' or goddess ' ; but this rendering seems , in most cases , unwarranted . When a Greek writer definitely meant a god , he seems always to have used the word theos ( plural theoi ) in the proper case form , the word daimon being used to designate a supernatural being of lesser rank than divinity , or when there was uncertainty as to whether the being was or was not a god . The extension of meaning , comparable to that of the Greek daimon , is found more widely in the sacred writings of the ancient Persians , where the term ahura ( or asura ) was applied to the gods , as well as to good daimons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as to mere demons . ' In Hinduism the same class names are used , with the meanings reversed ; deva meaning a god as well as a benevolent daimon ( although some of the gods are predominantly malevolent ) , while the term asura means always a demon . As can readily be seen , the distinction between good and bad daimons is by no means as clear in Hinduism as it is in Islam and in orthodox Christianity . Daimons are sometimes male , sometimes female , although possibly there are neuter daimons also . In Christian mythology , the angels appear to be considered as male , although some theologians have been doubtful on the point ; but in Syrian , Babylonian , and Arabian mythologies of the ancient period , there seem to have been male , female , and neuter angels . Satan , the chief devil of Christianity , is assumed as male ; but among devils of lower rank both sexes have been recognized . Among these are the incubi , male devils who creep into the beds of women , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men . During the Middle Ages , incubi and succubi were objects of widespread faith , and doubtless they are still believed in by some Christians , although I have met with but two persons who claim to have had personal experience with these entertaining devils . No comprehensive modern study of available information concerning the sex of daimons of the various religions has been made , so far as I know . That daimons both good and bad may enter into or possess ' human beings and the lower animals , has been a tenet of many religions . According to some Greek views , which possibly were late in developing , the tenancy could be lifelong ; but the more common doctrine was that the possession was temporary . In Christianity , // and in Judaism , the possessing daimon was always a devil ; but in Greek mythology possession by a benevolent daimon , or by a god , was assumed to occur . Possession by a god was ascribed to priestesses who delivered oracles and to other persons who were subject to epileptic , or epileptoid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divine disease , ' or the sacred disease . ' A typical case of devil possession related in the New Testament is that of the Gadarene man who was possessed by a legion of devils simultaneously , which were cast out and entered into a herd of swine ( Mark , 5 : I-20 ) . In the early centuries of the Christian Era , there was widely held a doctrine that every human being was throughout life possessed by a genius , ( the Latin term equivalent to the Greek daimon ) , which guided him . From this notion developed the use in modern languages of the word genius ' to designate a person of extraordinary talent or the talent itself . The earlier assumption that unusual mental ability was contributed by the person 's daimon was thus carried over into modern phraseology . At one Christian period , the belief arose that each person was possessed by two daimons , a good one , or guardian angel , ' and an evil genius . ' Accordingly , we still speak of a person 's evil genius . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who adopted it from earlier Pythagoreans . Daimons of some kinds have been associated closely with serpents . The Arabic jinn , when they become visible , usually appear as serpents , and any serpent may be suspected of being a jinni . This association seems to have been common in Levantine religions and may have been responsible for the reverence accorded serpents by Hindus . There seems to have been a similar association among the Greeks , for , aside from the serpent gods , the gods and demigods ( heroes ) often appeared in serpent form . Daimons , such as the jinn , have also been associated with the air or the wind . The Arabs assume that a whirlwind is produced by a jinni in travel , and the performances of the whirling dervishes may be motivated by the ancient superstition . It is not without significance that the word spirit ' is derived from the Latin spiritus , which means air ' or breath ' ; and that anima , from which our word animal ' is derived , also means breath . ' Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to an old Germanic root word for air ' or vapor. ' // The concepts of daimon , ghost , and life stuff have been sadly confused with one another . The doctrine of animism , ' as we have pointed out earlier , took its unfortunate name from anima , not in its proper sense of life stuff , ' but in the sense of daimon . ' Animism actually is the theory that religion originated in the belief in daimons . It would have been much less confusing if Tylor had called his theory daimonism ' or even spiritism . ' A generation ago , the theory that religion commenced in , and grew out of , the belief in daimons was widely accepted ; but it is now generally admitted that a belief in daimons is not essential to religion , however widely it may be involved in various religions . It should also be pointed out that a belief in daimons presupposes a considerable development of religion , which must have occurred before the belief in daimons could arise . For the first point , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither angels nor devils nor any other daimons . As to the second point , considerations will be brought in later . 4 . The Concept of Mana , or Power. ? Persons , animals , plants , and inanimate objects influence other organisms and objects . In the vernacular , we say that one thing has the power ' to aid , injure , or otherwise affect another . Powers of sorts that we , from our point of view , call supernatural , ' or , if we accept them as real , divine , ' have been features of almost every religion , civilized , semicivilized , and savage . We prefer at present to call powers ' which we consider to be supernatural by the term manas . ' Gods and daimons are conceived as having power to produce effects on man and animals and on the physical operations of the universe . In ancient Western religions , the gods produced , or controlled , the thunder and the lightning , the rain , and all the other phenomena that we lump together as the weather ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made trees and plants to grow and fish and animals to reproduce . The gods controlled the waves and tides of the sea ; they controlled the flowing of rivers and the running of springs . They made men to prosper ; they afflicted men with divers diseases and might cure them . The God of Christianity exercises all the powers of the pagan divinities , and more ; for he is credited with having created the entire universe , which the pagan gods were not . The God of Christianity , moreover , has power to raise human souls ' // to heaven or damn them to hell . Allah of the Mohammedans has the same power , but in older religions the gods were less influential in respect to the various appurtenances that survived man 's death . These are but illustrations of the manifold powers ascribed to gods . Daimons , on a lesser scale , have power to affect human life and in a limited way to modify the course of nature . To one who rejects gods and daimons , but for whom the world is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world power , which is in all or above all . Whether man takes a religious attitude toward the world power or a scientific attitude ( whatever the difference may be ) , the power is nevertheless recognized . This world power was recognized , as we have pointed out , by pagan religions and by philosophies developed out of them , as superior to the powers of the . gods . This world power was called by the ancient Mediterranean peoples by names that we translate by the English words fate , ' necessity , " nature , ' or the Logos . ' Man , in conflict with the gods , might beat them at their own games , or at least might give the divinities trouble in accomplishing their ends ; but man could not defeat nature , or evade or impede its operations . Modern science has adopted from the ancient philosophies the concept of infrangible natural law and of uncontrollable cosmic processes ; and some scientists have subsumed the cosmic principles under the concept of determinism . The terms power ' and powers , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ include influences , or potentialities , of three sorts , which it is well to distinguish . There are influences and potentialities that are capable of demonstration by practical procedures or by scientific tests . These influences and potentialities we may call physical , ' or natural ' powers . There are , on the other hand , powers which are assumed , or in which men believe , which are not demonstrably real , and to these we may apply a term that has been adopted into English and that may accordingly be treated as an English word , namely , manas ' ( singular , ' mama ' ) introduced into European languages by Codrington . Manas , however , are of two sorts , magical manas and religious manas . Magical manas are those powers which are believed in by some persons , but which have been proved nonexistent by practical or by scientific tests or which scientific tests have never yet found to be existent . The powers claimed by mind readers and spiritual64 RELIGION : ITS FUNCTIONS IN HUMAN LIFE istic mediums qualify as magical manas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as real . Religious manas include those which have received wide credence , but which are by the nature of their conceptions not capable of being subjected to scientific tests or even to practical examination . The powers ascribed to the gods are illustrations of religious manas . Concepts of sin and of tabu have been dominated in the past by the concept of mana . External sin is a taint or injury inflicted on a person by a god , a daimon , or some animal , plant , or object , which has the requisite mana . An object or a place is tabu because there is a deadly mana resident in and radiating from it . Certain acts are tabu because of the manas inherent in the acts , not necessarily manas of any gods or daimons . Spoken words , especially names of persons and gods , exercise manas that may be injurious . The powers ( manas ) of gods and daimons and influences exerted by inanimate objects and human beings in these ways may properly be called supernatural , whether we regard them as magical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supernatural , ' however , may be misleading , since no peoples who accepted manas that we call magical ' considered them as other than natural traits or properties . Certain men and women are possessed of manas of magical sorts . Magicians and witches who cause persons to sicken or who can heal them , who can change themselves into animals , or who in various minor ways can control the processes of the physical world obviously have the manas that are adequate for these performances . Holy men ' are men who have mana radiating from them and are therefore dangerous to oppose and even dangerous to touch . The efficacy of the manas of holy men is retained in some sects of Christianity in the laying on of hands to transmit religious authority or to heal the sick . The line between the powers that we consider to be natural and the manas that are magical is a changing line . With progress in civilization , many powers that were considered to be natural become mere manas of superstition . A generation or two ago , physicians administered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heal patients . Some of these drugs ( quinine , for instance ) are still used , since the powers ascribed to them have been certified . Many others are no longer employed , since their alleged powers have turned out to be mere manas . Some drugs , on the other hand , which were once // supposed to be merely armaments of magic , have turned out to have the powers ascribed to them . The plant from which ephedrine was extracted is an illustration . Another illustration of a change from the magical to the natural is the verification of what was once regarded as an Arab superstition : the belief that mosquitoes , by their bites , communicate malarial fevers . No matter where we draw the line between the natural and the supernatural , we must admit that there are powers which are real . Electricity has the power to light our houses and turn the wheels of our machinery ; and we commonly refer to it by the simple word power . ' Every man has varied powers ? to walk , to run , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words have power of a natural sort . The action of the pitcher sends the ball through the air ; the word you utter may cause another man to halt and turn around . The power of whispered scandal may bring ruin to its victim , and verbal propaganda has ruined nations . The savage and ancient conception of mana is merely an extension into the region of phantasy of the concept of powers that have been obvious to all human beings . Beliefs in powers exercised by persons and objects are found in all religions , and sometimes it is difficult to decide whether these powers are mere manas ( figments of magic ) or concepts of religious faith in the proper sense . The concept of power is involved in all science , as well as in praxis . Fortunately , in studying religion from the psychological point of view , we are not interested in deciding whether a belief is a true belief or a mere superstition . Through all religion , as well as through science and everyday assumptions about the world , there runs the notion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least , all four of the causes described by Aristotle : final causes , formal causes , efficient causes , and material causes . The ascription of a mana to a god , a person , or an object is merely the assumption that it can cause such and such results . The term mana ' was borrowed from the language of Melanesian groups who inhabit certain islands in the western and southwestern Pacific . in Melanesian usage , the concept of mana is applied characteristically to the causal efficiency which is believed to reside in animals , in plants , and in inert objects , but it is applied also to the powers of men and of supernatural beings . The savage concept call be understood if we liken the mana-charged object to a wire carrying a high-tension current . The wire is dangerous ; if touched // carelessly it can harm or kill a person , hence proper procedure in approaching it is essential . Wearing rubber gloves ( for lower voltages ) or standing on an insulated platform ( for higher voltages ) , one may handle the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , charged with a powerful mana must likewise be approached in certain specified ways . The fact that we consider the savage manas to be mere magical concepts and that we consider the rituals employed to protect one from the manas to be foolish superstitious practices is of no consequence for our consideration of the manas or the rituals . The characteristics of plant and animal substances that make them suitable foodstuffs and the characteristics of other substances that make them poisonous , are , to the savage , merely manas . From sound experience , magic develops , by unwise extension of a principle of causation that is not understood . While the characteristics of some things are wholly bad , the manas of other things may be used to advantage , if used in the proper ritual way . Just so , certain substances that are poisonous are used as medicines . The dangerous characteristics of plants and animals are inherent in the species or vary according to conditions of growth or training ; but the magical manas may be transmitted from one object to another or acquired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not necessarily ascribed to a daimon residing in it ( contrary to Reinach 's opinion ) , although the conception of a resident daimon may appear eventually . The error of Reinach , and of some other ethnologists , is due to their assuming that savages are really primitive , in the fundamental sense of the term . The fetish of the savage , made of bits of animal , plant , and mineral substances , acquires mana in the process of manufacture and remains potent thereafter . Stones may have various manas ascribed to them because of their size , location , or coloration , but when a block of stone is cut into the form of an idol , it acquires new manas . Certain images , for example , have had a mana that , when a barren woman rubs her body against it , enables her to conceive a child . The bones of a saint acquire mana from him , so that after his death the bones have magical healing power . Any object , however , when treated by the appropriate ritual , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mana . Some medals protect travelers ; others bring horses in the money ' at the track ? provided they have been properly blessed . // Among ancient peoples , any object which a person habitually carried with him , or which he wore on his body , was assumed to absorb mana from him . On this account , the Greeks and the Romans never used the armor or weapons taken from slain enemies . The weapons had acquired the manas of the enemy warriors , which were inimical to the slayer and could injure him . To counteract their dangerous manas , captured weapons and armor were hung or stacked in the temples of friendly divinities . The concept of mana , as we have indicated , is indeed world-wide in religion . It was found in ancient religions ; it is still prevalent among savages and is found in modern religions of civilized peoples . Many Christians believe in the potencies of amulets , charms , and holy relics . Truly , Nothing is lost in religion . ' The belief in manas seems to have arisen through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to potencies that are superstitiously ascribed , the extension being made because ignorant man made no distinction between magical potencies and the actual potencies , which were to him just as mysterious as the manas he invented . The great stone is potent to crush the man on whom it may fall and has the potency to resist the effort to move it . Accordingly , it may have further manas not so easily demonstrable . The tree has the ability to produce fruit that is food for man ; therefore , manas that may be helpful or harmful are ascribed to it . Serpents have qualities that make them good food and snakes of some species have a death-dealing power , so manas are ascribed to them . When man starts the enlargement of potentialities beyond the field of demonstrable powers and qualities , there is no limit to the list of manas that may be invented . Given the concept of mana , and the attribution of important manas to animate and inanimate objects , the eventual development of concepts of daimons and gods may be predicted , unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The concepts of divine and semidivine beings and the concepts of souls ' and of a future life are not starting points for religion , but mark fairly late stages in its development . The concept of tabu , of course , since it is based on the concept of mana , is preceded by the mana concept . 5 . The Concept of Souls. ? The name soul ' is freely applied in English to a wide range of concepts , which are found in ancient and modern religions , folklore , and philosophies . Attempts have been made to define religion in terms of belief in souls , but these definitions // encounter many difficulties . There are so many kinds of souls involved in the different cults , and these are so confused with one another , not only in popular belief of the present day , but also by anthropologists and historians , that it is seldom clear what kind of soul a definition of religion in terms of soul is presupposing . Furthermore , since the soul concepts of different religions are various , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is essential to religion . There is perhaps no other term in anthropology , folklore , philosophy , and the discussion of religion that has such confused meanings as has the word soul . Accordingly , it is necessary to proceed cautiously , and laboriously , in discussing the concepts of souls . We may best begin by presenting some of the various soul concepts that are relatively simple , and then we may consider the various combinations that have been made of these concepts . The only common factor of the various souls is their assumed nature as aspects of the human being , or , we may say for convenience , as human appurtenances , which have been considered as entities , organs , or powers that are relatively isolable from the total human being . z . The Psyche or Life Principle. ? The process of living , or being alive , has been widely assumed to be the result , or the function , of a specific life stuff , or life entity . In early Greek beliefs , this life stuff was designated as the psyche @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning of psyche was life , in one of its aspects , lifestuff or life-principle and was so used by Aristotle . The nous was the life-stuff considered as something floating in , or dissolved in , the atmosphere ; and Aristotle modified this to mean a supernatural influx into human beings who otherwise would be merely natural beings . In later Greek theories , which were adopted by the Hippocratic school of medicine , it was called the pneuma . Although the psyche was not considered as individuated , or as a property of an individual , translators of classical Greek writings and historians of philosophy render the term too frequently by the word soul ' and imply that the soul is an individuated human appurtenance . In ancient Egyptian theories , the life principle , considered as an individuated appurtenance , was called the Ba . When in a translation of an Egyptian papyrus or inscription one finds the word soul , it may stand for the Ba ; but unfortunately , it may be a translation of another Egyptian word , for a quite different appurtenance . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are // applied to the life principle , which seems to have been conceived of in all religions . 2 . The Ego or Subject of Consciousness. ? The term ego ' properly designates that which in a human being thinks , perceives , and feels . In Homer 's verses , this ego is called the thumos ( Latinized as thymus ) . The term for the ego in Egypt is somewhat uncertain , but the most probable term is khu , which Egyptologists translate sometimes as personality .

' There are types of religion , however , that are intermediate between these extremes , which are called dualisms . ' Dualistic religions postulate a good or beneficent divinity and an evil personage antagonistic to the good god ? an evil divinity , in fact . Zoroastrianism , the religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religion of the Parsees , assumed a good god , Ahura Mazda , and an evil god , Ahriman . Satan plays an important role in Islam and may have been important in one or more of the Syrian religions from which Judaism developed . In dualistic religions , Satan , the arch devil , is subordinate to the good god , although he persists as an evil power in spite of the beneficent divinity . No religion can be said to be strictly montheistic if it assumes a continuing power or person of superhuman status , who is an enemy or rival of the good god . Christians who accept Satan as a real power can not be said to be strict monotheists . Christianity further deviates from strict monotheism , in its orthodox sects , by postulating a trinity ; a postulation that theologians have endeavored to harmonize with monotheism . Judaism , on the other hand , is completely monotheistic . The god of Judaism is definitely male , and the gods of Islam and of Christianity are officially male . In the early period of Christianity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some of the church fathers contended that the Holy Ghost should be female , but those who held the male view won out . Since the symbol of the Holy Ghost was the dove , which was an accepted symbol of pagan female divinities , it would appear that the original notion was that this factor in the Trinity was feminine . In polytheistic religions there are usually female divinities ( goddesses ) as well as male divinities ( gods ) . But in Brahmanism , and in most other Hindu religions , Brahma , the supreme god , is impersonal and therefore neuter . From the point of view of highly developed religions , it may seem absurd to ascribe sex to a divinity , and this ascription is intelligible only when one considers the actual process of creation of divinities . Divinities , in the stream of development we are considering , were first female , as we shall point out later , and the change from female to male has been a slow process , not always accepted popularly even when confirmed officially . It is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as personal beings . Although the Christian god is officially male , it is difficult to // deny the divinity of the Virgin Mary in Catholic Christianity . To many Roman Catholics , in fact , the trinity that is designated as JMJ ( Joseph , Mary , Jesus ) is more real and more venerated than the official Trinity of the church . In polytheistic religions , the gods usually differ from one another in respect to their benevolence and malevolence , although all have their malevolent aspects avenging neglect and disrespect and even indulging in cruel whims and in deceit . The God of monotheism also has his dark side , punishing the innocent for the sins of the guilty and visiting the sins of the fathers upon the children to the third and fourth generation . In moderately late stages ' of religious development , gods are personal beings , having attributes similar to those of human beings . Being sexed , they have sexual intercourse with one another and with human beings . As the religions evolve further , the divinities become male and tend to delegate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In some forms of Christianity , God is an impersonal power , just as in Hinduism Brahma , the supreme god , is impersonal ( as well as neuter ) , being the total reality of the universe . Since the impersonal God is a late development in Christianity , and since Brahmanism claims to be a very old religion , it would appear that there is a progress toward impersonalism as religions become older and more highly developed . This may account for the relatively slight importance of gods in Confucianism , Taoism , and Shinto . It may be that religion progresses from impersonal polytheism , through personal polytheism to monotheism , and terminates in impersonal monotheism . One of the major tendencies in definitions of religion has been to make belief in a god or in gods essential , to define religion in terms of belief in gods . Such definitions would exclude the original Buddhism , which denied gods or which at least insisted that they are iiimportant .

Frazer calls this the external soul , ' although , since it dwells in a person , we might well call it the indweller . ' The indweller may leave the person during sleep ; hence , superstitious persons deem it dangerous to awaken a sleeper suddenly , since the indweller might not have time to return . It may leave a person when he yawns ; hence , the custom of holding the hand before the mouth when yawning . The nature of the indweller soul is indicated by the belief , common in the folklore of savages and of European peasants , that a person may lose his soul ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be aware of any loss . A wizard or medicine man may detect the loss and find the soul and return it to its owner . Obviously this indweller is not the life principle , nor the ego , but is a possession which the owner can lose , just as he may lose his spear , his ax , or his pocketbook . It is usually believed that the person who has lost his soul is vulnerable to environmental features from which the indweller protects him . In any case , the indweller seems to have the function of a protective daimon , or guardian genius . Frazer would have done better if he had called the indweller the separable soul ' or the dispensible soul ' instead of employing the paradoxical designation of external soul . ' Expressions that refer to losing one 's soul are frequent in Christianity ; those who use such expressions are not commonly referring to an indweller that is separable from the body during life , but to a soul similar to that invented by Plato . That the expression harks back to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Man Himself. ? In ancient belief , there is a soul that was designated in Greek as autos . This autos was the man himself , that is , the essential feature of the person . The ancient notion of immortality of a desirable sort did not involve the psyche , or the ghost , but was immortality of the autos . In the case of Herakles , his body was burned and his ghost went to the underworld ; but Herakles himself ( autos ) was taken to the society of the Olympian gods and goddesses . The appurtenance of the man which was admitted to the Isles of the Blest was likewise the man himself . The ghost persisted , in an underworld existence which was considered deplorable , but the notion of a blessed immortality involved the man himself . Was this an immortality of the ego , or subject of experience ? We do not know . All we can say is that CONCEPTS INVOLVED IN RELIGION 7T the autos was the immortal element in some men , for not all men were assumed to attain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the ego , the personal daimon , the ghost , the indweller , and the man himself ' ? are all presented by translators and ethnologists as souls , although ancient peoples did not confuse them . Other appurtenances called souls are found in the superstitions of various peoples and are designated by distinctive names , which only translators confuse . The souls of ancient religions and of the religions of savages are appurtenances that differ from one another in their attributes . The differences between the different human appurtenances that translators call souls can easily be determined . The ghost , as the Greeks conceived it , did not exist during the person 's lifetime , but came into existence at his death . The thumos , on the other hand , functioned during life , but nothing is said by Homer about its continuation beyond death ; hence the thumos may be assumed as ending with the decease of the person . However , since the thumos was the ego , or subject of experience , and the man himself , ' if he survived death , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the thumos persisted . The life stuff , whether called psyche or nous , was relatively eternal ; but this stuff was constantly being lost be exhalation and in the bodily secretions and constantly replenished by inhaling from the atmosphere , which was the reservoir of psyche or nous . The personal daimon was conceived as continuing a personal existence before the birth of the person as well as after his death . Greeks of the Homeric age , and somewhat thereafter , seem to have believed unanimously that every man employed life stuff in his physiological processes , and had a subject of experience ; thus , in the confused terminology of translators , a man had two souls ' during his lifetime . After his death , a third soul , ' the ghost , appeared . Some Greeks , but apparently not all , believed that the man had a personal daimon , a fourth soul . ' All ancient peoples further believed that one or more of the many daimons in the universe might temporarily possess ' a man , in which case , he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifth type , to which the term soul ' could be applied as reasonably as it is applied to the other appurtenances . Whether ancient peoples believed in the indweller that Frazer calls the external soul , ' or whether this soul ' is a late development , is not certain . The autos ( the man himself ) of a hero , or of a man specially // favored by the gods , could survive death ; but this was exceptional . Of ordinary human beings only the ghost survived ; and this is an obstacle to the identification of the autos with the thumos . That combinations of two or more of these souls into a single human appurtenance was conceived is possible . Our first written evidence for such a combination occurs in the dialogues of Plato . Plato 's combination of the ego , or one form of ego , with the personal daimon , may reasonably be called the Platonic soul ' ; and since this soul concept was eventually adopted by Christian theologians ( with a slight modification ) , it might be called the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ghost ) with the ego and the daimon is not certain , but Christian concepts of the soul ordinarily make this combination . According to Plato 's Socrates in one dialogue , the soul has an eternal existence , both before the birth of the man in whom it dwells , and after his death . All Christian conceptions of the soul agree with Plato in assuming the immortality of the soul after the death of the person ; but as to whether the soul existed before his birth , or was created de novo at some moment between conception and birth , there has been a difference of opinion . Plato 's Socrates seems not to have been quite sure of the traits of the composite soul . We might suppose that it is the man 's soul , and only his soul , which is conscious , which perceives , feels , and thinks . In some statements , however , Plato 's Socrates implies that the body , as well as the soul , is conscious . The best notion we can gain from Plato 's dialogues is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul , combining a life principle with an organic ego or bodily subject of experience . Second , a daimon soul , which was conscious and immortal , distinct from the bodily soul . Third , a possessing daimon , or guardian genius , distinct from the ego daimon . This explains why Socrates , the second soul , could talk with his possessing daimon , or third soul . There are other possible interpretations of the conflicting statements of Plato 's Socrates , and such have been offered by scholars who have ignored the discrepancies . From the Platonic uncertainty as to the exact nature of the soul , we may conclude either that Plato invented the composite soul , or that the conception had not occurred much earlier and was not yet standardized . Although Plato called the soul the psyche , he does not seem to have identified it with the life principle called psyche in Homer 's poems , and it certainly has no relation to the psyche of Aristotle . This combination of the life // principle with the soul is common among Christians , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relate the life principle to the bodily organism ( bodily soul ) , as Plato seems to have done . Our terminology would be simpler and clearer if we could use the word soul to designate only the immortal ego-daimon appurtenance and employ other terms to designate souls ' of other sorts . Established usages , however , do not permit this simplification ; we may compromise by employing hyphenated terms for the simple souls . The four simple souls of early conceptions are then : ( a ) the life-soul ( psyche ) ; ( b ) the ego-soul ( thunzos ) ; ( c ) the daimon-soul ; ( d ) the ghostsoul , or ghost ( cidolon ) . To these we may add ( e ) the indweller-soul , or external soul ' and ( f ) the immortal man himself ' ( autos ) . If we examine Hindu religions , we find still other types of soul ; but we need not consider these or the various types of souls in Egyptian religion . The accounts of the various types of souls involved in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , although we are certain that many savage groups conceive of souls of several different sorts , we are unable to determine the specific characteristics of these various sorts . The foregoing points should suffice to make clear two facts . First , that we can not define religion in terms of souls . The term has so many meanings that a definition applying to religion in one stage is meaningless for other stages . Second , that psychologists do not discuss the soul in elementary courses in psychology . This is not because psychologists necessarily deny the reality of any of the sorts of souls , but because the concept is so thoroughly confused that it is of no use whatever . 6 . The Concept of Metamorphosis. ? In the mythology of ancient peoples , and in the folklore of peasants and savages of the present day , we find widely spread the belief that a human being can be transformed completely into a lower animal , such as a wolf , bear , tiger , or snake , or even transformed into a tree or other plant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' This mythological conception must be given attention , since it must be distinguished from the concept of daimon possession . Some scholars have distinguished between religion and mythology , opining that they are subjects for two different fields of study . The distinction is a tenuous one , since much of our information concerning religion is derived from mythology , and some mythological concepts // are so closely integrated with religious beliefs and rituals that it is unsafe to rule them out of consideration . The metamorphoses of the Greek and Roman gods into animals and into men are familiar to all persons who have dipped even superficially into the beliefs of those peoples . Zeus , for example , became a bull to seduce Europe ; a swan to seduce Leda ; a cuckoo to seduce Hera ; and took on forms of other animals in the prosecution of other amours . Demeter , Athena , and Apollo changed themselves into animals and birds when the changes were convenient . Daimons presumably had the same power of metamorphosis . In Arabian mythology , jinn appear characteristically in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animals or human forms . The habits of divinities , of assuming human form in endless variety , made ancient peoples especially careful in their treatment of strangers , since any stranger might be a god or goddess or a daimon . That this belief was held by peoples in Arabia and Mesopotamia is shown by the legend of Abraham , Sarah , and the three strangers . Gods , moreover , could transform human beings into animals , and magicians could perform similar metamorphoses . Zeus changed lo into a heifer , and Circe changed her dupes into swine . At the altar of Zeus Lukaios , in Arcadia , men were metamorphosed into wolves and , if they ate no human flesh during their lupine periods , might eventually become men again . Ancient mythology is filled with such legendary stories of metamorphoses . Even without the action of a god or of a magician , persons might change themselves into animals . This belief still persists among European peasants as the belief in the werewolf . The belief in the werewolf has existed in southeastern Europe from ancient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is a corpse that maintains a kind of animation by sucking the blood of living persons ; also from the Zombi of the West Indies , which is not a bloodsucker but whose activity is maintained by sorcery . A werewolf is a human being who is supposed to be able , at will , to change himself into a wolf and back to human form again . In their lupine forms , werewolves ravage sheepfolds , and kill and eat human beings , while in human form they appear little different from ordinary persons . In some regions of the earth , this picturesque Jekyll and Hyde transformation involves other animals ; in India it is the tiger into which men transform themselves . These metamorphoses are not to be regarded as the passage of // some sort of soul ' out of the human body into an animal ; that passage would leave behind a soulless ' human body . The belief is that the whole man , including his body and all personalized appurtenances , changes into an animal . The man ceases to exist as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animal which did not previously exist , comes into existence . The man 's body becomes the wolf 's body ; and the man 's soul ( or souls ) becomes the soul ( or souls ) of the wolf . One might wonder what becomes of the human being 's clothing in such a metamorphosis . Reports in some cases seem to indicate that the clothing remains where the transformation occurred , furnishing thus incriminating evidence concerning the werewolf . In reports of other cases , there is no mention of the clothing , but the ignoring of the garb does not necessarily indicate that it was transformed into the hairy coat of the wolf or other animal . Some scholars seem to have confused the ancient belief in metamorphosis with soul beliefs . Early Greeks believed that at death the body of a man , or some part of the body , was transformed into a snake . This metamorphosis , or fractional metamorphosis , has been interpreted as a belief that the snake was the man 's soul ; an interpretation which is erroneous , at least as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plays no role in religions of the more advanced types , unless we should interpret the transformation of the elements of the Eucharist into the actual flesh and blood of Christ as a fractional metamorphosis . Many people of groups which are supposed to be civilized , do , however , believe in the possibility of total transformation of human beings into wolves and other animals . The belief is even more widespread among savage and semicivilized peoples . 7 . The Concept of Sin . In almost all cults accepted as religions , there is a concept of a human condition that is designated as sin . ' These conditions fall into two groups , which we will distinguish as internal sin ' and external sin . ' The use of these terms is not well standardized , but we shall explain them and illustrate them as we proceed . Internal sin is a condition of culpability or guilt that is due to a person 's own acts or behavior . The concept is sometimes narrowed further by the stipulation that the guilt is due to voluntary actions , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious rule // or principle or to conscious failure to act in accordance with a positive religious rule . If a man enters an enclosure which he knows is tabu to him , his entrance constitutes a sin , of the internal sort ; but if he does not know that his entrance is forbidden , the sin is not internal , although deadly results may follow . For some Christians , engaging in work or sports on Sunday is sinful , if the one so engaging knows that the day is Sunday ; but if he has mistaken the day of the week , the actions are not sinful . Internal sin , in short , is usually conceived as determined by the intention , purpose , or conscious attitude ' of the sinner . Jesus , speaking of this situation ( Matt. , 5 : 27 ? 28 ) goes so far as to say that if commission of a certain act is sinful , then the purpose , and even the desire to commit it , is just as sinful . The purposes involved are sometimes made the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and immorality are not necessarily identical . The principles of some religions make infraction of an ethical rule , or even the intention to infract it , a sin ; but even in these same religions there are sins that are not immoralities . For many Christians it is a sin to take communion after eating a meal , since a religious rule forbids such action ; but the action could hardly be called immoral . ' Sin must also be distinguished from crime ; for crime is infraction of a civil rule or law , and behavior which is not forbidden by law is not criminal , even if it is both sinful and immoral . External sin is a human condition which is not dependent on volition , knowledge , or consciousness , but is a taint which may be acquired unintentionally , even unwittingly . In the same way , a person may contract tuberculosis or malaria unintentionally , even without knowing about it . External sin may even be hereditary , constituting thus a taint for which the individual is not personally responsible , since he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is provided by the Christian doctrine of original sin , which is not merely a doctrine regarding the imperfection of human nature , but a concept of a taint which may lead to the damnation of an individual unless something is done ritually about it . The Christian doctrine might be supposed to be merely an extension of the Jewish belief that the sins of the father are visited on his progeny unto the third and fourth generation ; but the doctrine is much older than Judaism , or even the Hebrew religion , being embedded in the religions of the ancient Greeks . // A man can acquire external sin by his own acts , just as he may become infected with a physical disease by his actions . The man who enters the tabued enclosure unwittingly , becomes infected with external sin as one may acquire typhoid fever by unwittingly drinking infected water . All ancient people were in constant fear lest they should sin unknowingly , for sin is as deadly in such circumstances as it would be if they were aware of what they were doing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seats had to be sprinkled with the blood of pigs , in order to purify the members of the audience from any sins which they might accidentally have acquired . Ancient people regarded a man tainted with external sin as being as dangerous to other persons as is , in our modern opinion , a person infected with a communicable disease . The deadly mana the person has acquired may be transmitted to other persons . Some scholars have put forth the theory that external sin is a late concept of religion , and that the concept of internal sin is older ; but this is the reverse of the truth . External sin is old and universal ; while in ancient religions internal sin is scarcely recognized . In savage religion , also , the concept of internal sin is little recognized . Taking both sorts of sin together , it might seem possible to define religion as including any cult or system involving the concept of sin . Basing religion on sin as its essential and differentiating characteristic seems , however , a drastic step that we can hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear to make the teachings of Jesus , as they are reported to us , antireligious , since Jesus attempted to eliminate the concept of sin . It is true that Jesus was in some respects antireligious , since he was opposed to much that has passed , in his day and since then , for religion ; but it would still seem an extreme position to assume that the teachings of Jesus were basically antireligious or to assume that there can not be a religion that does not involve a concept of , and a belief in , sin . Confucianism may eventually be classed outside of religion , but its exclusion because it does not include the concept of sin would seem , at present , too arbitrary . 8 . The Concept of the Other World . There appear to be several different concepts of an other world ' ; and the relations of these concepts to one another are relatively complex . In most of the concepts the other world is contrasted with the world of everyday life . // I. There is a concept which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a substantive expression . Sometimes this expression is meant to refer to a world other than the world of sensuous experience , but it is more often metaphorical , indicating merely habits and attitudes of life that are deemed impractical , or as some say , idealistic . ' Every metaphor , however , is derived from expressions of realistic meaning ; the use of the expression other-worldly implies logically the concept of an other world , whether or not the one who uses the expression believes in such a realm . 2 . The concept of an other world is often the concept of the realm in which the dead , who have left this mundane life , are still existing . A person , at death , is said to have passed into the other world ; sometimes the expression passed beyond ' or passed over ' is substituted . A person who believes that some aspect or appurtenance of a person survives death usually believes in an other world , although it is possible to believe that the survival is in this mundane world of our daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other world is conceived as the residence of the gods , or of God and the angels . This other world may be conceived as bifurcated ; Divinity and the demigods inhabiting one section , and Satan and his imps infesting the other section . This concept of a bifurcated other world is characteristic of orthodox Christianity and Islam but is not confined to these religions . One who believes in gods and devils may or may not believe in an other world . Early in the development of concepts of gods and daimons , these beings were conceived as dwelling in this world in which men live . It is evident that the second and third concepts are basal , and that the first use of the term , insofar as it does not refer directly to one of the other concepts , is a derivative of one or both of them . Obviously , these two concepts may be combined , the world of the gods being also the world of the dead . If there are two other worlds , ' God , the angels , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , while Satan and his imps may be hosts to the damned in the other . In some religions , there is faith in a third other world ( purgatory ) intermediate between hell and heaven . The nature of the other world , in either conception , depends on the assumption , or belief , as to what the condition of the gods , or of the dead , or of both , really is . In the period before Plato in the Mediterranean world , the other world was merely another region of this CONCEPTS INVOLVED IN RELIGION world . The gods , when they were not down on the surface of the earth , were in the sky , perhaps a little higher than the birds some-times , but still in our mundane sphere . ' They were not subject to ordinary human limitations , but in this respect they differed from heroes in degree only , as the heroes differed from ordinary men . From this point of view , the achieving of divine status by men of exceptional merit is understandable . A distinction was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atmosphere , ( aer ) , and the substance in the higher regions , which was the aetlair , ( ether ) . The concept of the ether as an upper stratum of the atmosphere , seems to have been universally accepted . Mt . Olympus , in Thessaly , and high mountains in other regions , were supposed to project through the aer into the actlair , and so were suitable dwelling places for the great gods , after they became associated with the sky . ' Further , in the Greek world there were hosts of daimons and minor divinities who were practically earth-bound ; satyrs , nymphs , oreads , dryads , river gods , and a long list of other beings were as much of this earth as were men , horses , and snakes . The ghosts of the dead , on the other hand , inhabited a region which was sometimes supposed to be a cavern underground , sometimes a far-off region on the surface of the earth . A few men were trans-ported to the Isles of the Blest , where they ( not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were conceived as actual mundane territory , far to the west , where they were lapped by the river Ocean , the description strongly suggesting Salisbury Plain and the adjacent downs in England . The other worlds for the Greeks , therefore , were merely parts of this world , differing from Greece or Asia Minor not otherwise than did the far northern land of the Hyperboreans ( Scandinavians ) , the regions about the Gates of Hercules , ' or distant Ethiopa . The realm of Hades , lord of the ghosts , was difficult to find , but Ulysses and others entered it while still alive . The heights of Olympus , where the great gods had their palaces , were scalable , but in ancient times few men would attempt the feat any more than they would wander uninvited into the chamber of a human king . There were other places , closer at hand , which were as dangerous , the reckless or careless entrant dying immediately by the power of the resident god or daimon. 8o RELIGION : ITS FUNCTIONS IN HUMAN LIFE It would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mediterraneans there was no other world ; and , in fact , the people of this area did not use the expression . There were merely regions of this world which were set aside for special purposes ; for gods , daimons , ghosts , and exceptional men . These regions , however , corresponded to regions that later men did call an other world ' or other worlds . ' The Isles of the Blest corresponded to our heaven , and the realm of Hades approximated our hell . For a long period of the Christian Era , moreover , hell was located under the earth , and heaven in the skies , or on other planets , still in this world even if farther off than the Greeks supposed their fabulous realms of the gods and of the dead to be . It is possible that in India the conception of an other world is more advanced than in the ancient Mediterranean world . It is possible also that some negroid peoples have had a more advanced concept . In Egypt there was , apparently , a basis for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky world of the gods and men who chose the better way , ' were , to the end of the Egyptian culture , parts of this world , being merely lower and higher parts of it . The region in the west , to which went Egyptians at death by the worse way , ' was a region on the earth 's surface . The first suggestion of an other world which is not just a far region of this world is found in Plato , although , for all we know , earlier Pythagoreans may have had the concept . While not contrasted with this world in a clearcut way , Plato 's description of the world in which the daimon-psyche lives before its incarnation , and after the death of the body , marks a definite step toward the conception of an other world that is not merely a different region of this one . Christianity , taking over Plato 's daimon-psyche as the soul , was influenced strongly by Plato 's conception of the other world , but yielded to popular conceptions and brought the other world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the popularization of the results of the great advances in geography and astronomy , the other world , for many Christians , has become more and more remote from this world . There is no doubt , however , that , to Christians of many groups today , heaven is in the skies and hell deep in the earth ; while to others , slightly more sophisticated , these other worlds are vaguely located on remote planets , a notion tellingly burlesqued in Mark Twain 's account of Captain Stormfield 's Trip to Heaven . // The final conception of the other world as not in space at all , but completely free from spatial limitations , is probably held today by few persons , although the conception of the other world as timeless ? transcending time ? is accepted more widely . It is significant that while the word eternal ' is understood by many as signifying timeless , we have no corresponding word for spaceless . That the concept of the other world , or other worlds , as timeless and spaceless is the ultimate form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress continues , is certain . The progress of the last 3000 years in European religion has been steadily in that direction , and some of the many Hindu religions have already attained it , so far as the literate among their adherents are concerned . Although for the bulk of Hindu religionists the other world is much like the other world of the Greeks before Plato 's times , the implications of the other world as timeless and spaceless are clear in Brahmanism and in . some of the religions that have developed out of it . The advanced Hindu conception , however , is somewhat startling in the naivete of its logic to one who is not familiar with the Eleatic philosophy of Greece and Italy . The other world , being timeless and spaceless , is never and nowhere . It does n't exist . One who enters it , therefore , attains salvation by ceasing to exist . The technical term for this goal of nonexistence is nirvana . ' Some philosophies , like the Sankhya system , and some heretical religions , like early Buddhism , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the irresistible tendency of the systems founded on the Vedas is toward it . Consideration of this Hindu conclusion raises at once the question of the gods of Hinduism . Are they in this same other world , and therefore nonexistent ? This question can he answered . The gods , with one exception , are in a world similar to this world ; in fact , they are practically in this world . In this respect , Hinduism is in the stage in which Greece was in the Homeric era . The exception is Brahma , who is distinguished from the Brahma of the Hindu trinity , which consists of Brahma , Vishnu , and Shiva . Brahma , of course , is a paradoxical figure . It ( the name is neuter ) is the central reality of the universe ; we might say , the Logos . It has no qualities whatever ? no sex or any other traits that can be described . Brahma , in short , is nonexistent ; it represents the finality of divinity , the nothingness into which man also can be absorbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worship is // directed to it , and Brahma is so associated with Brahma that he is little worshiped , there being only two temples to Brahma in all India . Orthodox Hindus are divided into two great groups : the Vaishnavites , who worship Vishnu , and the Shivaites , who worship Shiva . The worship in each group may be directed more to the goddesses associated with the gods , but the classification is official . There is no Hindu name for worshipers of Brahma , for there are no devotees of Brahma ; at least there are none among the orthodox Hindus . When we trace the concept of the other world backward in its development , we have no difficulty in concluding that in a really primitive religion there was no concept of an other world ' in any sense . The Mediterranean peoples of 2,500 years ago were barely emerging from this primitive stage . The conception of the dead as existing in a special region of this world is a step from the notion that they continued in the region in which they had lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gods , walking the earth , or on the mountaintops , or flying through the air , are but a step from the rnanas which were assigned to the animals , trees , and other objects among which man lives . It was a step , nevertheless , in the progress toward the conception of an other world . ' The concept of the supernatural as contrasted with the natural depends upon the concept of an other world . Ancient man believed in events that we class as miracles ; he held many beliefs that we class as superstitions . There was , however , nothing in his world which , from his point of view , was supernatural ; for the distinction between the natural and the supernatural does not arise until there is a concept of a super-nature an other world ' . 9 . The Concept of Salvation. ? ' Salvation ' may be loosely defined as the process , or the condition , of being saved ; that is , of being rescued from , or protected from , some harm , danger , risk , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of equivalent words in other languages , salvation means the rescue of the person , or of some appurtenance of the person , from some danger or threat to his existence or his welfare . In some religions it is the person 's soul ' which is saved or protected , either in this world or in an other world . ' In Islam and Christianity salvation is the prevention of a state of misery which threatens the person or threatens his soul ' in the other-worldly period which follows death and the guaranty of a state of felicity in the other world . // Hindu religions generally regard personal life in this world as unavoidably miserable and felicity as unobtainable . Life beyond the grave is assumed to be miserable , whether or not the person is reincarnated . Salvation for the Hindu , accordingly , is the ending of conscious life . According to some of the orthodox Hindu religions , salvation is attained through absorption into the impersonal Brahma , thus ending personal existence and danger of rebirth . That which is absorbed is , for some religions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all orthodox Hindu sects . On the other hand , Buddhism , an unorthodox religion which rejects the soul , teaches that salvation can be obtained through reaching nirvana , the state of nothingness . One branch of orthodox Hinduism , represented by the Sankhya system of philosophy , assumes the reality of a soul , ' and denies that the soul can ever be absorbed or annihilated . Salvation , as viewed by the Sankhya system , is the attaining of eternal unconsciousness , for a soul that is unconscious can not suffer . All Hindu religions , orthodox and unorthodox , agree that salvation is the ending of personal consciousness . Hindu religions reached their present forms , so far as we know , just before the Christian Era , but we can not trace their courses of development . We assume that all religions , savage , barbarous , and civilized , have developed over long periods from primitive concepts , but some religions have developed more rapidly than have others . The stages in the development of savage and barbarous religions can be guessed only by comparison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Western world , the histories of which are better known . These comparisons give us some light on the development of the concept of salvation . In the period from boo to 400 B.C. , in the Mediterranean world and Asia Minor , the Orphic mysteries , the mysteries of Demeter , the Dionysiac mysteries , and various other mystery cults offered a salvation much like that of early Christianity . These mysteries were increasing in popularity during the first century of the Christian Era , and Christianity was able successfully to contend with them only by adopting the salvation they offered . The mysteries were elaborate rituals , into which candidates were initiated . The details of these rituals we do not know , for initiates were sworn to secrecy . Pagan writers who had been initiated , as for example , Herodotus and Pausanias , carefully avoided revealing any information . I : know , ' says Herodotus , but I can not tell . ' This is a matter it is not proper to relate , ' says Pausanias . Even Clement // of Alexandria , converted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at them . We do know , however , what the purposes of the mysteries were , in their later forms . Initiation into the mysteries assured happiness or an alleviation of misery after death . In some cults , apparently , this happiness was for the ghost , which had a less deplorable existence in the underworld than did the ghosts of the uninitiated . For other cults , probably it was a possessing or indwelling daimon or an external soul ' which was benefited in the other world . For still other cults , perhaps it was the man himself , ' vaguely conceived as an integrated person , whose future welfare was assured by initiation . Before the rise of the mystery cults , in the Homeric age , salvation was bestowed on a few heroes by special act of a god . Herakles was transported to the Olympian home of the gods , although his ghost went to the underworld . Some others were transported to the Isles of the Blest . Rituals of cremation and burial contributed to other-worldly welfare , by releasing the ghost , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse off if compelled to hang about the decaying body . Whether , for ordinary men , cremation was considered as sending a spiritual body ' to the celestial abode of the gods , is a question , but the body of Herakles was burned . When , from the early concepts of ghost , life entity , indwelling daimon , and the even more nebulous concept of the man himself , ' the synthetic concept of the soul developed , salvation was the saving of this soul . Plato 's view was that this salvation was attained through wisdom ? the understanding of the facts about this world and the other world . It is probable that some such notion had begun to form in the Pythagorean cult before Plato . Knowing the truth , and regulating one 's earthly life thereby , could end the succession of incarnations of the soul ; and the soul ( not the man himself , but a certain part of him ) could dwell eternally in the other world of pure ideas . ' Escaping from the body , the soul escaped from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all other feelings , being attributes of the body ego , not of the soul ) and lived a life of pure thought . Prior to the rise of the notion that something could , in this world , be done about the other world , salvation was freedom from danger in this world and the securing of happiness and mundane prosperity . Protection is required , not only from physical hardships and handiCONCEPTS // caps of natural occurrence , but especially from the malevolence of the gods . Actual assistance may be secured , if the gods are properly approached , for the gods may bestow good as well as evil . The means to this end is righteousness ' ; but righteousness meant merely conforming to rituals of sacrifice and worship approved by the gods . Zeus , Athena , and other divinities were worshiped under various of their aspects , among which the aspect of Savior was highly important . Shrines to Zeus Soter ( Zeus the Savior ) and Athena Savior were plentiful in the Greek world . There were other savior gods and goddesses , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Savior . In Christian usage , the term salvation is restricted to otherworldly protection and blessings , although the ancient concept of this-worldly benefits to be obtained through religion still persists . xo . Mystical Experience. ? In many religions , and in some philosophies that do not claim religious status , there is the concept of an experience which , for most purposes , can be called mystical . ' The belief that such experience is possible is mysticism . ' This mystical experience , and that which is experienced therein , are held , in the philosophies that have developed the most advanced mysticism , to be incapable of description . The mystic experience is not perception , nor is it thought ; it is something above these . It is not consciousness , in the ordinary sense of the term . Since knowledge , in the psychological sense , is a matter of perception and thought , the mystical experience is referred to as the third kind of knowledge . ' The indescribability of the experience and its content follows from the fact that words refer to , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so are not directly applicable to the third kind of knowledge , which transcends perceiving and thinking . Any verbal explanations about the mystic experience , we are warned , are misleading ; but by a variety of descriptions we may be given some notion of its ineffable nature . The mystical state or experience is also called union . ' It is as if , in knowing , the knower and the known become identical . Instead of being contrasted , as in psychological experience , they are one . The relation between knower and known which we call being aware ' or being conscious ' is thus completely excluded . The knower , ' for the time being , is that which he knows . ' Discriminating the knower from the known , as they are before // union , the object to be known is , for most philosophical mystics , either God or Ultimate Truth . In union with the divine , one is identified with the ultimate principle of the universe and so may be said , in inadequate metaphor , to know all truth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' is another human soul . ' The outstanding formulation of the doctrine is given by Aristotle , who elevated the ancient Greek concept of noes into that of superknowledge , super-knower , and super-known . Nous is the divine element in man ; it is divine knowledge , and its object is itself . A close paraphrase of Aristotle 's formula is : Nous houses sous . The technical term for the state in which the mystic is when he has the mystic experience is ecstasy , ' which means , literally , a standing out . ' The person stands out ' from himself , from his ordinary condition , becoming other than himself because he is absorbed into the divine reality . In common parlance , we use the term ecstasy for an emotionally exalted state ; but when we use it in reference to mysticism and mystics , we must avoid confusing it with the same term as loosely or metaphorically used . Mystics deny that ecstasy is an emotional state ; for they claim that the mystic experience is above feeling , as it is above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mystics really is a state of pure feeling ( and therefore not an emotional state at all ) , we must constantly bear in mind the mystics ' denial of this conclusion . In the usages of religious persons who are not philosophically oriented , a wide range of experiences that are , strictly speaking , not mystical at all are included under the heading of mystical experience . ' Seeing of visions and hearing of voices is not really mystical ; for the contents of these experiences are thought contents and are describable in words . A supernatural message or revelation of fact or doctrine is not mystical . There is nothing mystical in messages given by spiritualist mediums . Thought reading and extrasensory perception ' may be superstitional , but they are far from being mystical as is the watching of a horse race , or thinking about the war . Saint Theresa is commonly called a mystic ; but there is little in her report of visions of other-worldly visitants ; tactual contacts with them ; or hearing of their voices which could properly be called mystical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supernatural beings upon her , as described , are strictly emotional . Such experiences and states we distinguish as pseudo-mystical. ' // In various sects of the Christian religion , there is some mysticism and a great deal of pseudo-mysticism . No sect has denied the possibility of ecstasy , but the use of mystical phraseology does not necessarily indicate a mystical meaning . The Roman Church is truly Catholic in regard to mysticism , neither denying nor endorsing it . Outside of religious circles and philosophical schools , the terms mystic , ' mystical , ' and mysticism ' have no meaning , but are commonly mere terms of reproach hurled by one scientist ' at another whose theories or postulates he dislikes . Etymology , here , is completely misleading . Our word mystic ' is derived from the Greek word for persons initiated into a mystery cult , but , paradoxical as it may seem , there was nothing mystical about the ancient mysteries , so far as we can tell . We must distinguish carefully between the terms mystery ' and mysterious ' on one hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other . Mysticism is a belief in a supernatural principle , but otherwise the vast range of beliefs in the supernatural that have held through the ages are not mystical . Belief in mind reading , astrology , spirit communications , extrasensory perception , ghosts , and various other alleged occult ' phenomena and objects is superstitious , but not mystical . In addition , certain religious beliefs that are not to be classed as superstitions , whether the beliefs are or are not valid , are beliefs in the supernatural but are not necessarily mystical . The belief in God and the belief in the other world are of this order . ai . The Concept of Holiness . Holiness , or sanctity , in all religions , attaches to persons , places , actions , and material objects . The priest is a typical holy man . A temple or sanctuary is a typical holy place . Sacraments such as baptism are typical holy actions . Crucifixes , amulets , and the bones of saints are typical holy objects . The range of holy persons , places , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concept of sanctity runs broadly through religion everywhere and in all times , and the concept is intelligible only when the range is surveyed . For convenience , we may best consider the personal , local , ritual , and objectival aspects of holiness separately , and attempt to bring these several aspects together in a final synthesis . i . Holiness of Person. ? In some sects of Christianity today , the concept of personal holiness is a conception of moral value , or personal worth . This concept , of course , involves notions of social relations . A moral man is one whose life is exceptionally full of the // virtues of justice , truth , generosity , gentleness , and love . Even a god is deemed holy only if he evidences these moral qualities . This concept of holiness has evolved from the concepts held by ancient people , for nothing appears de novo in religion , but the evolution has been a process of considerable length , and the modern concept , as held by the more advanced religionists , differs sharply from its antecedents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . ancient religions generally , holiness and morality are not so closely connected , and in fact , in some religions they seem to have no bearing on one another . In Hindu and Moslem religions , a holy man is one who follows a prescribed mode of life , in which neither what we would consider morality , nor even decency , is essential . Holy men , in these religions , are devoted to selfish ends , seeking their own salvation or welfare . This is true also of Christian monks of some types , although others devote themselves to the service of their fellow men . In non-Christian religions of the present and past eras the conception of holiness as a characteristic apart from the social virtues has been almost universal . Herakles , the greatest of the heroes , who was taken to dwell with the gods at his death , was guilty of every important crime in the catalogue , but his murders , larcenies , rapes , seductions , mendacities , and varied injustices were , apparently , conducted with ritual holiness . Herakles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Kleomedes also was powerful physically . Odysseus ( Ulysses ) was a hero of lesser rank , greatly admired for his skillful lying and trickery , as well as for his physical exploits . In all religions , the real characteristic of the holy man is his possession of mana . This power may be nothing more than the ability effectively to conduct rituals that are inefficacious when conducted by unqualified persons . The Brahmans have that power and are holy men , as compared with men of other castes . The mana of the Brahman is hereditary but can be lost by failing to observe the caste distinctions . Other holy men in other religions have the power of prophecy or the power of discerning truth . This power is usually assumed to be a special gift from a god , but may be dependent also on ritual preparation , such as abstaining from certain foods , self-mutilation , or the hermit life , or , as in the case of the pythoness of the oracle at Delphi , intoxication by drugs or the inhalation of vapors . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the production of miracles of various sorts or in effective blessing or cursing . The miracles are not always voluntary productions but may be produced by mana radiating from the holy man automatically . The miraculous mana does not cease at the holy man 's death . The bones , hair , or nail clippings of Christian , Mohammedan , and Hindu saints work miracles for centuries . A sick , person , for example , may be cured by touching a holy man , or touching his clothing , as in the story of the woman who was cured of a disorder of twelve years ' standing by merely touching the hem of Jesus ' garment , after which Jesus realized that virtue ( mana ) had gone out of him and asked , Who touched my clothes ? Touching the bone of a dead saint , or being in its immediate vicinity , may be just as effective . The newer concept of holiness has not been completely adopted by all sects of Christianity . In some sects , the manas possessed by the priest are valid even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken away from him by higher authority of the church . Sacraments administered by an officially authorized priest are efficacious , however sinful or heretical the holy man may be , unless his power has been officially revoked . The priest is , in any case , but an instrument through whom power is transmitted or in whom it is manifested . Most Christian sects recognize , however , that it is not proper that a person should be classed as holy unless his life is moral , or at least free from vice . The contrast between this concept and the more ancient concepts is brought out sharply by the fact that most ancient religious approved certain groups of prostitutes , ritually selected and controlled , as holy and provided these holy women in the temples . The custom is still kept up in some Hindu temples . Intercourse with sacred prostitutes was , and is , a religious ritual . In some ancient religions of the Levant , sacred male prostitutes , for homosexual relations , were provided or approved . The term in Semitic languages for such prostitutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King James Version of the Bible by the word dog . ' Consideration of prostitutes and sex perverts as holy persons is excluded from the modern concept of holiness as strongly as is the consideration of thieves and murderers . Holy men of Islam , however , may be sex perverts . 2 . Holy Places. ? In modern times , as in late pagan times , a holy place is a locus in which the power or mana or god or daimon , or of a go RELIGION : ITS FUNCTIONS IN HUMAN LIFR holy man or woman , is manifested . In Christianity , Islam , and Hinduism , the characteristic holy places are temples , churches , mosques , tombs of saints , and similar enclosures or unenclosed shrines . In the Mediterranean area , as in countries farther east , wells , springs , and streams were sacred in ancient times and in some religions still are . Some streams and water sources were especially holy because routes of travel passed by them and pilgrimages were made to them . Among the more important sacred wells in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beersheba , Mamre , and Mecca . The Pool of Siloam along with these others was holy long before the rise of the Hebrews . The Zem-zem well at Mecca is still important in the pilgrimages of Islam , but in. earlier times the other wells above listed were just as holy . In the Greek world , practically all springs giving out an appreciable volume of water were holy , although some were especially sacred . Sometimes holy men created springs , as did Moses in the wilderness . Holy animals such as the winged horse , Pegasos , also created important springs . Presumably the mana of the holy man or animal continued in the spring , but more probably the sanctity of the animal was derived from the spring . Some rivers , such as the Adonis , were sacred throughout their entire lengths . Others were sacred at certain parts of their course , like the Alpheus , which was sacred in Elis , where it flowed by the temple of Olympian Zeus , but which may not have been sacred in its smaller branches in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the chief river of Damascus , which Naaman the leper thought as full of mana as the Jordan ( II Kings , 5 : 12 ) were sacred throughout , and their sources were more holy still . The source of the Jordan remained holy down into the period of Roman control , when under the name of Paneas it was sacred to the old Arcadian god Pan . The important temple of the Syrian goddess at Baalbek ( Heliopolis ) was at the source of the river Leontes . In regions where springs ( living waters ' ) were not found , wells and pools were holy ; but otherwise , the living waters were primarily the sacred sources . The symbolic use of the term living waters ' is widespread in ancient literatures . From the practical point of view , springs and headwaters are freer from contamination than are wells , ponds , and rivers in their lower courses and so are more palatable and better for drinking . In desert areas , wells , although usually contaminated and tasting of minerals and decaying vegetaCONCEPTS INVOLVED IN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for human and animal life . The lower courses of rivers , however , are indispensable for irrigation and household purposes . The sanctity of water supplies is based on factors that are exceedingly practical . The manas of waters easily became extended beyond the limits of actual functions . Waters of sacred springs and rivers were used not only for drinking , washing , and other natural purposes , but also for ceremonial drinking , bathing , sprinkling , and other ritual uses . Pilgrims took away bottles of water for the ceremonial uses at home . Moslems still carry water from the well Zem-zem , and Christians from the Jordan , deeming it especially potent for sprinkling in baptism or for the exorcising of demons . In general , however , Christians consider any clean water to be filled with sufficient mana for ritual purposes if consecrated by the priest or minister , who contributes the requisite mana to the water . In some places , it was believed that a divinity or daimon lived in a sacred pool or spring , in the form of a serpent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the water . In the Greek world , important rivers were not merely assumed to be the habitations of divinities , but were themselves assumed to be gods . Since the river gods were represented in statuary in human form , often with animal characteristics , indicating an earlier animal divinity , it might be supposed that the consideration of the river as a god was merely a metaphorical way of considering the god of the river . On the other hand , there is some basis for the supposition that the rivers as such were really believed to be gods . Perhaps both beliefs may have been held in different places and different times . The oft-recurring legends of a river begetting offspring by a human mother may have meant that the god of the river , in human form , had intercourse with a woman ; or it may , in some instances have embodied the belief ( familiar in many areas ) I hat a woman might become pregnant simply by bathing in a river endowed with the mana of a male . Offerings were made to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , by casting articles of actual value or of symbolic meaning into the waters . Statuettes of gold , silver , bronze , or clay ; money and jewels ; weapons ; and articles of many other descriptions were thus offered . Oracles were consulted at some springs . One form of divination was through the casting in of offerings ; if the offerings were cast out , the sign was unfavorable. // Ordeals were carried out by causing the person under test to drink of the water . If , for example , he were guilty of perjury , the draught would be fatal to him . Among places held to be holy , mountaintops occupy an important position , and so mountain areas were favorite sites for temples . The houses of the major gods and goddesses were believed to be on the tops of the higher peaks and ranges , such as Sinai , Parnassus , Olympus , Ida in Crete , and Ida in the Troad . Around these peaks the clouds clustered , the lightning flashed , and the thunder roared . Power of great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peaks , the rains spread out to water the thirsty soil , and the streams had their sources in the mountains . These were places of danger , to which ascent would be safe only for holy men , with due ritual . On the lesser peaks , altars were consecrated and sometimes temples were built . Sanctuaries , consisting of open enclosures of masonry or upright logs , were common on level areas below the peaks themselves . Sacred areas were sometimes recognized without enclosure . That these sacred heights below the storm levels had their origins in the early usages of elevated places for lookouts against enemies and for signaling , as well as for encampments rendered safe by their relative inaccessibility , is indicated by similar developments in western Europe . Although early holy places were for the most part mountain heights , or precincts of water , there were many other sacred areas . Wherever a temple was erected , or an altar built , it became holy . Shrines , sanctuaries , and temples were in many cases placed at spots already holy ; but wherever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a divinity or daimon , whose manas were there manifested . The tomb of a holy man or saint is holy ground in all religions , for some many of the saint continues to emanate from it . Dens of serpents , such as the snake pits at Eleusis , might become very holy . Caves were the dwelling places of powers , and a large rock , especially if of peculiar form , might be a Beth-El ( house of god ) . Any place in which power was manifested was holy ground . The practical importance of trees was early evident to man , not only of fruit trees , but of others . As the forests on the mountains and plains are denuded , large trees standing alone are valued for their shade , in which a traveler may rest , or in which Socrates // and his friend might discuss philosophy . The holy areas around specimen trees ( rowan trees ) in hot countries are easily explained . Dense thickets , in which wild animals lurked , also became holy ground through their importance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious development that we shall consider later in detail , along with the holiness of food animals . The outstanding feature of holy places , holy objects , and holy persons is their dangerous or inimical nature . Unless one comports himself circumspectly in sanctuaries , and with regard to holy men and holy objects , one will be injured . The holier the place or the object , the deadlier its mana . The man who put his hand on the Hebrew ark with the best of intentions , was struck dead forthwith , for this was the holiest place of the Hebrew religion . The boys who reviled Elisha , the holy man , were devoured by bears . These stories can be matched everywhere in the ancient world , and among savages . On the other hand , benefits were to be derived from holy places and holy persons , by those who understood the techniques . The altars , shrines , temples , and sanctuaries were places where supplication of the divinities and ritual sacrifices to them were most effectual , as soon as divinities were conceived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although it was the presence of the holy snakes in the sanctuary which was of major importance . On the other hand , the cures performed at the grotto of Lourdes were done by virtue of the power of the Virgin , who once manifested herself there . The mana infused into the holy place continued . Bathing in holy streams and springs was not considered sacrilegious , but gave benefits from the manas of the waters . A holy man approached reverently and with gifts in the ritual way may give healing and prosperity . He may bless , as well as curse , and so may the gods and daimons . Some divinities and some places were completely inimical . They exercised manas that could not be turned to good use for men . Some divinities , however , were both malevolent and benevolent , according to the way in which they were approached , or according to their feelings at the time . No divinities were wholly well disposed toward man . The manas exerted by holy places are of various sorts . To enter into certain sanctuaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blind . In other cases , death came // to the violator within a year . Into some sanctuaries an authorized priest could go , but for a layman to enter was presumed to have unfortunate consequences . In many Greek sanctuaries , as in the Hebrew temple , there was an inner holy place forbidden to laymen , although they might with impunity enter the outer court . In temples or sanctuaries that were open to laymen , and in the vicinity of shrines in general , circumspect behavior was necessary and previous ritual cleansing was required , in order to avoid evil effects of the mana of the place or of the divinity residing there . The best that could be hoped from any god was that he would be persuaded to be generous and benevolent toward his devoted worshippers and do his evil only on other people . The Hebrew view of Jehovah was , in this respect , quite in accord with the beliefs of the Greeks and other Mediterraneans toward their gods . To holy places and holy objects , the same considerations apply in part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are sources of benefit if properly used ; damage if improperly used . It is possible , however , that some places were believed to exercise no evil in any case . Whether this is the case in modern religion , it is not possible to decide . A somewhat similar situation surrounds some holy animals , such as the pig . A holy animal for the Mediterraneans and Syrians , it was an accursed animal for the Hebrews . In both cases , it was holy in the basic sense of exerting or emitting a powerful mana . Students of comparative religion have long accepted the view that the destinction between that which is accursed and that which is sacred is a variable , both being tabu because of their nianas , the actual line being drawn in accordance with the assumption that the power may be in the one case beneficial as well as evil and totally evil in the other . There is a peculiar practical aspect of holy places , which is important for two reasons . In the first place , it probably had influence on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second place , it undoubtedly had influence on the development of the concept of holiness as morality . All holy places in the ancient world were sanctuaries , in the sense that they were places in which conflicts between groups and punishment for offenses or reprisals resulting from combats were forbidden . In war , refugees who entered the temple of a divinity were safe . If the enemies violated the sancCONCEPTS // tuary and killed the refugees , dire results accrued to them eventually . Individuals who had committed crimes sought sanctuary ' in holy places . In later periods , only those who were guilty of manslaughter and lesser crimes were thus protected , but earlier , murder was included . In the Levant , areas around springs and wells were areas in which fighting was prohibited . Enemies might find refuge there ; in times of drought , flocks of peoples at feud with one another could be watered there . Those who violated the holiness of these neutral areas were , presumably , visited with punishment later . Runaway slaves could not be recaptured and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they reached certain of the Arabian sanctuaries . The holy springs were subject to the same rules . They were open to the use of all , and no controversies could be carried into their precincts . The advantage of having these sanctuaries scattered throughout the land is inestimable . Travelers could count on water , supplies , and resting places , from which they could not be driven by enemies and in which robbers dare not enter . In especially dry seasons , there were certain areas in which the remnants of the flocks of various tribes could be kept alive and thus the tribes be prevented from perishing . In these scattered spots , few though they were relatively , the brotherhood of man under the common fatherhood of the god was recognized , and there was a demonstration of the advantages of peaceful relations between peoples , contrasting sharply with the general situation , in which the brotherhood was restricted to the clan or tribe , while all hands were against all other tribes . 3 . Holy Objects. ? Objects , as well as persons and places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man may cling about his relics . Scapulars and medals may be ritually infused with mana , which preserves the life of the wearer or in other ways contributes to his welfare . In some cases it is the ritual treatment that creates the mana . In other cases the form of the object itself ( as the crucifix ) or its construction is partly responsible for the mana . The medal of St. Christopher that protects the traveler has a representation of the saint and his name upon it . The medal that helps the racing fan to pick his horses , or brings in the one picked , bears the image and superscription of the appropriate saint . This is not enough , of course ; the ritual of blessing ' the medal is essential . So , the composition of the fetish of an African native , from various materials , // cooperates with the ritual process of its making , to produce a powerful mana . The concept of mana inherent in certain objects , or communicable to certain objects , is ancient and world-wide . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religions and savage religions , they may be baleful to those against whom they are used and may be even disastrous to the user if used unskillfully. 4 . Holiness and Uncleanness. ? We have described sin as a taint or evil mana attaching to a person . It is otherwise designated as uncleanness , or defilement . In highly developed religion , sin is the antithesis of holiness . Satan , powerful as he is , is not holy , but is unclean . A wicked man can not be holy . This contrast , as we have pointed out , is relatively modern and is not fully embodied in all modern religions . Even where a sharp distinction is made between God or gods as entirely moral , and Satan , or devils , as thoroughly immoral , the same distinction is not necessarily applied to men and women . In few religions has even the distinction between good divinities and evil divinities been fully developed . In philosophical forms of orthodox Hinduism , and in some unorthodox forms , such as Buddhism , the distinction is made , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beings whose malevolence is feared while their good will is sought . Justice is not one of their characteristics , and they delight in cruel rituals . The God of the Israelites was appeased by savage treatment of tribes who did not accept him . Zeus of the Greeks , in one of his forms , was entirely malevolent , and the name Meilichos ( ' gentle ' or ' benevolent ' ) was applied to him in not too subtle flattery , in the hope that , by thus being addressed in worship , his evil disposition might be lulled and his evil power might be turned aside from his worshipers . In other forms , Zeus was a mixture of benevolence with malice and mendacity . This was to the Greeks no inconsistency , because the distinction between helpful power and hurtful power was not conceived . Power was potentially good and also potentially bad . Holy places , like holy supernatural beings , exercise power that might have hurtful or harmful effects . Human beings who are wicked , in the modern sense , might be holy ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they had contracted external sin , their manas were wholly bad , and they were a source of danger to other peoples who might come near them . They were accursed , the antithesis of being holy . // Animals and objects might also be unclean , accursed , and so dangerous . Contact with the unclean animal or object might infect a person with sin , which is specifically the uncleanness of a person . As we trace this contrast between holiness and accursedness back toward the beginnings of religion , however , we find it disappearing in the undifferentiated concept of mana . Animals and places that appear in later times to be divided into those which are tabu because they are holy , and those which are tabu because they are unclean , earlier were not so distinguished . They were tabu because they had powerful manas . The notion that hygienic purposes were involved in the tabus on uncleanness in ancient religions , and that the rituals of purification had hygienic bases , is quite unfounded . Only one of the tabus has so far been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on menstruating women , since the menotoxin to be found in different secretions at that period is poisonous to growing plants . But no hygienic significance has been found in any other forms . Contact with dead bodies is no more dangerous than contact with living ; ritual hand washing does not protect against infection . There may be , however , if not hygienic at least practical bases for some of the tabus , as in the removal of offensive odors . CHAPTER IV THE EVOLUTION OF DIVINITIES a . The Final Pagan Divinities . ? Gods are not essential for religion ; for religions that have discarded gods have survived , for a time at least . Buddhism is an instance of a religion that , in its original form , considered gods as of no importance , which is practically the elimination of gods . All religions , however , in their normal course of development reach a stage in which gods and goddesses appear and multiply ; and some religions have gone into further stages , in which the goddesses are eliminated and the gods reduced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throws much light on the development of religion , and even on . its primitive origin , the most important information being supplied from the ancient religions of the Mediterranean area , although comparison with the religions of the Levant , of western Europe , and even of India is helpful . Our information concerning the development of divinities in these areas is , of course , less complete and less reliable than is the available information concerning the Mediterranean area , in which the population became grammallkos in a prehistoric period . The evolution of divinities in the Mediterranean area seems to have reached its final stage somewhere near 50o B.C. , but was nearing completion by ' coo B.c . The primitive stages are lost in the obscurity of the remote past , but from the early processes which left their evidence in the final religious conceptions , and from comparison with other religions , we may , with reasonable certainty , infer the early parts of the development . We may even conjecture the further developments that would have taken place if the Greek culture had not been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were twelve major divinities ? seven gods and five goddesses organized mythologically into a royal family and assigned to a seat of government on the stormy heights of Mount Olympus , in Thessaly . There were , however , many other divinities who were not included in the royal 98 // family . Some of these divinities who were not included in the Olympian group were , nevertheless , of primary importance ; some , on the other hand , were secondary divinities who were rated as progeny of the major twelve . In the period of Roman domination , the Greek divinities were equated with the gods and goddesses of the Roman pantheon , and in translations of Greek writings the Roman names often arc substituted for the Greek ones . Such equations and substitutions , however , are not valid and are avoided by modern scholars . The Olympian twelve ( with their Roman substitute names ) were Zeus ( Jove ) , Hera ( Juno ) , Poseidon ( Neptune ) , Aidoneus or Hades ( Pluto ) , Hephaistos ( Vulcan ) , Ares ( Mars ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Aphrodite ( Venus ) , Hermes ( Mercury ) , Athena ( Minerva ) , and Demeter ( Ceres ) . The family relationships of the Olympian gods and goddesses differ in different legends , but the most widely accepted account is given by Hesiod . Zeus and Hera are brother and sister , progeny of an earlier pair of divinities , Kronos and Rhea . Zeus and Hera , nevertheless , were husband and wife ? an incestuous relationship that some later Greeks rejected . Apollo and Artemis were children of Zeus by Hera or by the goddess Latona , who preceded Hera on Mount Olympus . Hephaistos ( Hephaestus ) and Ares were considered as sons of Zeus and Hera , although Hephaistos seems to have been an ancient god of the Mediterraneans while Ares was probably a later importation from Asia . Hermes was the son of Zeus and Maia , an ancient Arcadian goddess . Aphrodite , the wife of Hephaistos and the mistress of Ares , was the daughter of Zeus by Dione , an ancient goddess . Demeter had no connection with the Olympian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children to Poseidon or to Zeus . Hades was regarded as a brother ( or half brother ) of Zeus , and so may be considered as a member of the Olympian twelve , although his residence was not on Mount Olympus , but in the underworld over which he ruled . Persephone was an ancient Arcadian goddess , hardly to be distinguished from Demeter , but was later differentiated as the daughter of Demeter . She was commonly called Kore , ' a name that meant virgin , or maiden , until she was captured by Hades and taken to the underworld to be his queen . The Arcadian goddess whose name was secret and who was called the Lady ' was probably Persephone . I ' ; ros ( Cupid ) was either the son of Ares and Aphrodite or the son roo RELIGION : ITS FUNCTIONS IN IZUJIAN LIFE of Hermes by an unspecified mother . Asklepios ( Aesculapius ) , the serpent god of healing , was a son of Apollo by a human mother . Hygeia , the goddess whose image always was stationed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Apollo or as the daughter of Asklepios . Kastor and Poludeukes ( Castor and Pollux ) , the Dioskouri ( Gemini ) , who were important gods of mariners , were sons of Zeus by a human mother , Leda . Dionysos , who became one of the most important of the later gods , was , in one of his aspects , the son of Zeus by the human Semele . Athena , the great warrior goddess , who may have derived her name from the city of Athens , or vice versa , has a peculiar relation to the Olympian family in that she was born directly from the head of Zeus , with no mother . The artificiality of this system of divine relationships is obvious . Athena , Demeter , Kore , Artemis , Hermes , Maia , and Poseidon were ancient Mediterranean divinities , of Pelasgic or Celtic origins . Both Aphrodite and Ares are generally assumed to have been Asiatic divinities , imported into the Mediterranean area . Apollo is considered by classical scholars to have been a god imported from the northern area of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held to have been an importation from the region north of Greece proper . Classical scholars are apt to go to extremes , but it can be admitted that some of the aspects or features of Aphrodite , Apollo , and Dionysus in their later conceptions were importations , assimilated to Mediterranean divinities ; and it seems fairly certain that Ares was an ass god , originating in Asia Minor , for whom there was no Greek god to which he could be assimilated . The promiscuous sexual relations of Zeus are to be explained by the obvious fact that Zeus was a synthesis of various earlier gods , each of whom had his goddess . The attempts to systematize the divinities of the Mediterranean peoples began before the Homeric era and was evidently a plan for the bringing of some order into the confused and chaotic polytheism that had developed . Similar systematization was attempted in Egypt , Mesopotamia , and India . In the first two areas , the work of the priestly class is obvious . In Greece , there were multitudes of priests , but no organized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or under the control of the local civic government . The systematization of divinities , accordingly , appears to have been the work of the poets , such as Homer and Ilesiod . TILE EVOLUTION OF DIVINITIES ror Some of the ancient divinities , who retained their prestige to the end of Greek culture , were not taken into the royal family or assimilated to any of its members . Among these were Pan , the Arcadian god of the woodland and of goats , and Maia . While there are indications that Dispoina ( the Lady ) was merely a descriptive epithet for Persephone , it is possible that the indications are misleading . If this is the case , Dispoina , who remained to the last an important Arcadian goddess , should be added to the list . a . Processes in the Evolution of Divinities .  --  In the production and modification of divinities there are six processes recognizable . These processes occur in combination but are analytically distinguishable. z . Primitive Origin , or Creation of Individual Gods and Goddesses. ? This process we shall consider and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? The adoption in one area or by one group of a divinity that had originated in another area or among people of another group . In many cases , the immigrant divinity was not adopted as a total . individual , but certain aspects of a foreign divinity were imported and added to a native divinity . 3 . Assimilation of Divinities. ? The merging of an immigrant god or goddess with one of native origin . In some cases the result of the merger was called by the name of the native divinity ; in other cases the name of the alien divinity was imported and applied to the synthesis . In most cases , the assimilation was more nominal than real ? the synthetic divinities being distinguished thereafter from the original native component . Sacred animals from one region were sometimes assimilated to sacred animals in another region , although the animals had not attained to divinity . Symbols of divinities migrated freely , sometimes , apparently , without migration of other aspects . 4 . Multiplication of Divinities. ? Occurring through migration and incomplete assimilation in most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divinities in the local area may have been involved . 5 . Systematization of Divinities. ? In default of assimilation , divinities were arranged in families such as the Olympian or grouped in trinities as in Egypt and Mesopotamia and partially in India . 6 . Change of Sex of Divinities from Female to Male . There is no doubt that divinities in the areas we are considering , as well as in Egypt , Mesopotamia , and India , were created first as goddesses and that some were later changed into gods . Ioz RELIGION : ITS FUNCTIONS IN HUMAN LIFE The creation of divinities came first in time and may well be called the primitive ' factor in the evolution of divinities . The other processes listed above have not been uniformly consecutive and have followed different patterns in different areas . Migration of divinities seems to have begun early , but the migration continued to the end of the religions , except for those religions which became monotheistic . Synthetic divinities produced by assimilation continued . Change of sex seems to have come rather late in the religions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the multiplication of divinities . Creation of new divinities apparently ceased in the Western world before the Christian Era but has not ceased in farther Asia . In western Asia , the goddesses were supreme down to the period of Roman domination , although the change of sex commenced earlier and was continuing . The goddesses of the Levant were associated with the earth , as the mother of all plant and animal life . These goddesses were especially worshiped on high mountains , and the goddesses may have been their mountains personified . When , later , male divinities were assigned to the mountains , the goddess of the mountain became the wife of the god . Goddesses of the same types , with similar attributes , had various local names , of which two or three are typical . In Phrygia the mother goddess was Kubele ( Cybele ) ; in Cappadocia and the Pontis , her name was Ouris . In other parts of Asia Minor she was called Ma ( mother ) . The Thracian Bendis and the goddess at Ephesus designated in the King James Version @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' seem to have been similar to Kubele in attributes and in rituals employed in their worship . In Crete the mother goddess was Rhea ; but Britomartis , an ancient goddess of the fisherman , had an important place . The Arabian and Babylonian goddess Ishtar was introduced into Syria and adjacent religions as Aslitart or Ashtoreth , from whom later developed Aphrodite . In Assyria and in Armenia there were goddesses of the same type as the ones we have named , and the Anaitis of the Persians may have been borrowed from the Armenians . With many of these goddesses were associated male divinities , as their husbands , lovers , or sons . With Kubele was associated Atys ( Attys or Attis ) ; with Ishtar , Tammuz ; with Aphrodite , Adonis . The names of these gods varied locally , and the male associate of a goddess in one area might be assigned to a different goddess in // another area . Thus , Paris , the villain of the Trojan war , is assumed to be a symbol of Atys , although Helen is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contact with the peoples of Asia T , finor and other parts of the Levant , applied the names of their divinities to those of the Asiatics , as did the Romans later . Thus we have a long list of Asiatic goddesses called Artemis ' ; and a long list of gods called Zeus . ' In some cases , as in that of the Artemis ( Diana ) of Ephesus , the name of the city was attached as a surname , to distinguish the divinity from others to which the same name was applied . In other cases , the original local name of the divinity was attached as the surname . We find , for example , a long list of Zeuses distinguished by their native names as surnames . 3 . The Local Origins of Divinities. ? Each god or goddess appears to have arisen as the divinity of a particular group of people . Traces of this origin persist in the myths and legends of European and Levantine religions , but we perhaps come nearer to the primitive in the religions of nomads of northwestern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not attached to a locality , but follows the group in its wanderings . If and when a previously nomadic group settles in. an area and begins an agricultural life or a localized pastoral life , the god settles with them and becomes the . lord ' of their area . In the Semitic languages that were spoken by peoples of various racial stocks , these localized gods were called Baalhn ( singular , Baal or Bcl : lord or ruler ) . Raving become attached to the soil , the gods remained as local divinities after the population was destroyed or removed , and new populations in the areas were subject to the rule of the Baalim and were required to worship them ( see II Dings 17:24-28 ) , although the newcomers might worship also their own gods . The early populations of Europe created or adopted gods , but whether these peoples were nomads in their remote period , we do not know . On the other hand , we are unable to conclude that the autoclithonous populations developed gods before they became attached to the soil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others of the red-haired , blue-eyed immigrants into Europe and the Levant brought their divinities with them or created them after settling is another problem for the solution of which we have no basis . Although the religions of the nomads of interior and northern . Asia may be regarded as nearer to the primitive than // are the religions of Europe , inferences from the nomadic conditions to those of settled populations can not be made simpliciter . Among settled populations , divinities are developed mainly from economic necessities and economic practices . A hunting or a fishing people may develop gods of a sort , but with the adoption of an agricultural or a settled pastoral life , the development is more rapid and more important . This principle has been accepted by all scholars who have dealt with the development of religion , because it is obviously sound . To the practical features of life that determine the creation of divinities we shall give further consideration in the proper place . For present purposes , it suffices to warn that the conception of a goddess or a god @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the association of the divinity with a tribal totem ' gives no indication of the processes through which the divinity actually was created . Gods , or rather goddesses , are first conceived as trees , plants , or animals and later arrive at human status . Reinach has sagaciously indicated that the first step in the creation of a divinity is the ascription of sanctity to an entire species or variety of plants or animals and that the selection of a single specimen to represent the species is a later step . The deification of springs and rivers ( to which we have referred in Chap . III , Sec. ii ) seems at first glance to complicate our problem regarding the creation of divinities , but , as we shall see , this offers no real difficulties . The occurrence of deified abstractions is more of a puzzle . Abstract divinities were frequent before the classical period of Greece . According to Pausanias , there were at Corinth images of Terror , Necessity , and Force . At Athens there were images of Modesty , Reputation , and Effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( the people ) and Democracy . At Olympia , Pausanias reports images of Struggle , Opportunity , and Truce , while at Aegina in Achaia he found an image of Safety . Although abstract divinities , such as those we have mentioned , were probably of relatively late development , they are obviously products of the final form of the process of abstraction , which commenced by considering the manas of objects and of living beings in abstraction from the objects or organisms in which or through which the manas are exerted . The generalization of minas , which is a form . of abstraction , began early in religious development , even before the differentiation of religion from praxis . When the // mana of an animal is conceived as residing in all animals of the same species , an abstract concept of the many has been formed . The deification of an animal possessing a certain many is not in any sharp contrast with the deification of the mana abstracted from the animal ; and , from this to the deification of more complex concepts such as Truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Ways of Divine Migration and Consequent Multiplication of Divinities. ? When a people not attached to the soil migrate into a new region , they take their divinities with them , but even divinities that have become attached to the soil as Baalhn may be induced to break their roots and migrate with their people . This is easier for a pastoral people than for an agricultural population , but it is not probable that all the gods can be thus transported . The Hamito-Negroid invaders of Egypt brought with them from Ethiopia their hawk god , Ra , and their cow goddess , Hathor . But Ra flies and is not soil-bound , and the hordes of the Pharaoh apparently brought cattle into Egypt with them . Other African divinities , of whom traces persisted in Ethiopia , had become Baalim and were left behind . A conquered group may adopt the divini Lies of the conquerors , and even with some assimilation the multiplication of divinities is promoted by such adoption . On the other hand , the conquerors , if they settle in the conquered areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Both of these effects were produced in Egypt , and the multiplication of divinities was tremendous . When several groups , previously more or less independent of one another , combine into a nation , there is the tendency , often the necessity , for each of the local groups to adopt the gods and goddesses of all the others . This also is exemplified in Egyptian history ; for when the Names were consolidated into the two kingdoms of Upper and Lower Egypt , the divinities of each Nome were added to those of the other Nomes in each kingdom , with some assimilation of the new gods to the older . Even without conquest , colonization , or settlement in new areas , gods are imported from one group to another . This migration is promoted by trade relations between groups , by recognition of a common cultural basis of the groups , and sometimes by mere contiguity . The adoption by the Romans of the Asiatic gods Adonis , Mithra , and Ma may be explained as the adoption of the gods of conquered peoples ; but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FUNCTIONS IN HUMAN LIFE not a matter of conquest of the peoples from whom these gods were borrowed . Greek gods migrated to Asia Minor with no factor of conquest involved . Athena probably developed in Athens , but before the end of the classical era there were shrines and temples of Athena not only in various parts of the Greek world , but also in Asia Minor . This migration of Athena , Artemis , and other Greek divinities to the Levant may be said to have been largely nominal , the names alone having been assimilated to Asiatic divinities , but apparently other aspects of the Greek divinities were assimilated to some Asiatic gods and goddesses . 5 . Forms of Divine Assimilation. ? Assimilation of divinities , as we have already said in brief , may occur in either of two forms . An immigrant divinity may absorb a local god or goddess , or the local divinity may absorb the immigrant . Hera , originally the chief divinity of Argolis , probably furnishes an illustration of the second form . Hera was primarily a cow divinity who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , reducing them to the rank of mere heroines . Hera seems also to have absorbed a cloud goddess whose name may have been Euruphaessa ( Euryphaessa ) , and the cloud goddess did not even persist as a heroine , but disappeared completely . Traces of still other goddesses absorbed by Hera are indicated . In most instances , the form of assimilation is intermediate between the two extremes . Apollo , the oracular god of Delphi , included as his primary feature the snake god Puthon ( Python ) , but he had also the aspects and symbols of a swan god , an apple god , and possibly a wolf god . In a later period , Apollo assimilated some of the aspects of a sun god , although there remained a number of sun gods , such as Helios and Phaethon , whose identities were permanent . The apple god and the swan god were evidently immigrants from the nortliwestern - region of Europe , where the people called by the Greeks the Hyperboreans ' ( probably the Nordics ) lived , and were both completely assimilated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some legends , Apollo slew the Python ; according to other legends , the Python slew Apollo . In either case , the snake god survived as the principal feature of Apollo , who consequently was a god of healing , and the priestesses who gave the oracles at Delphi were called pythonesses . ' Demeter presents a peculiar case of assimilation . Demeter was a synthesis of a mare goddess , a sow goddess , a snake goddess , and to // barley goddess . In her rituals , myths , and symbols , she retained all these aspects , but eventually the barley aspect became paramount and the other aspects were assimilated to that one . It is probable that the relative importance of the various aspects of the divinities assimilated in Demeter had changed progressively in earlier periods . It is possible that the barley goddess originated at Eleusis and that the other goddesses were immigrants who were assimilated to the goddess of the barley , but there is no certainty as to this . According to scholars , most of whom have been plejudiced by too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the place of his foreign origin has been a topic for much scholarly disputation . The assumption that the various gods called Dionysos ' in different areas were all the same divinity , imported and naturalized on the all-or-nothing ' plan in the several places , does not , however , seem to be borne out by the evidence that these scholars have collected . The variety of aspects ascribed to Dionysos in different areas and the variety of plastic representation and pictures all support the interpretation that these gods were various local divinities who assimilated the name Dionysos , which possibly was imported , and who absorbed some other characteristics of different foreign and domestic gods . The outstanding illustration of the assimilation of divinities of a wide range to a basic concept and to a single name , with little else , is supplied by the Greek Zeus . ' The concept is that of a supreme divinity , at least of a divinity more or less supreme over other gods and goddesses ? to use Homer 's phrase , King of gods and men . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Greek tongue were never identified completely as a single divinity , but each retained his individual traits and was worshiped by his special ritual . The name Zeus can be accepted as a dialectical form of the word for god , which in classical Greek is theos , the name Zeus being eventually reserved for the great gods . As gods multiplied , the tendency to rate one as more powerful than another was natural . With the ascendancy of the male , there were gods called Zeus in various places , and the identification of these gods with one another was nowhere complete . As we have pointed out above , the various gods called Zeus were distinguished by surnames , which in many cases indicate the original god . Zeus Melosios was a protector of herds . Zeus Lukaios in Arcadia was a god of the daylight .. Zeus Asterios was probably an ancient form of Pan . rob RELIGION : ITS FUNCTIONS IN HUMAN LIFE The Zeus of the oak grove at Dodona is allied to Peruna and other oak gods of Slavic peoples . Zeus Pelasgikos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and no other , we can understand how Zeus was born in so many different places . We can understand also the various metamorphoses of Zeus as a combination of legends about a variety of gods . The Zeus , for example , who assumed the form of a swan to seduce Leda was evidently a swan god ; the Zeus who took the form of a bull to seduce Europa can easily be identified as the Cretan bull Zeus . Some of the ancient great divinities escaped assimilation into the nominal Zeus . These include Pan , Hephaistos , Hermes , and Poseidon . Hermes , however , became the messenger of Zeus , or , as has been said , the executive aspect of Zeus ' ; and Apollo was reduced to being the son of Zeus . These gods were too great and had themselves assimilated so many other divinities that they could not be taken into the nominal Zeus . For somewhat the same reason there was no female counterpart of Zeus . Demeter , Athena , and Artemis were far too important to be assimilated to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gods , was actually of lesser importance than these great goddesses . In the process of assimilation some curious myths were produced , in which the various god elements appear as actors in the drama . In the myths about Apollo , the god slays himself , for he ( the synthetic Apollo ) is the combination of the snake god ( python ) and the apple and swan gods from the north . In the Phrygian legends , Attis is slain by a wild boar under a pine tree ; but the boar is Attis , and the pine tree is Attis , so Attis slays Attis under Attis . This feature of a myth is technically called reduplication , ' but the real explanation is that Attis is the result of assimilation of a pine god and boar god . The persistence down to the end of paganism of the pine tree and the boar as symbols of Attis ( often designated as Adonis ) is thus comprehensible . In the less complex reduplications , Attis is slain by the boar , with no mention of the pine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An instance of reduplication due to the coalescence of two traditions is presented in the Gospel account of the crucifixion , in which Jesus and Barabbas ( Bar-abbas meaning son of the father ' ) seem to be the same person . In this story are combined the legend of a religious teacher , the legend of a leader of an insurrection against the // Roman government , and traditions of an older Syrian ritual of human sacrifice in which a victim was selected , crowned , and worshiped as the son of god , and finally killed that he might carry messages to the father god . ' 6 . Further Factors in the Multiplication of Divinities. ? Migration of divinities with incomplete assimilation results inevitably in multiplication of divinities , which eventually produces a chaotic polytheism ; but there are other factors that contribute to the multiplication . The change of divinities from female to male did not always eliminate the goddess , but left her merely reduced in status , thus increasing the number of divinities . Assimilation of an immigrant divinity to a native one usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goddess was imported into an area in which there was already a divinity of the same name , the native and the imported divinities remained distinct . To the original Athena at Athens were added by importation at least six other Athenas ; these Athenas were never combined , but remained different Athenas . This is an illustration of a divinity migrating from her original home , acquiring a differentiating surname and some changes in attributes , and then migrating back to her original place . In other instances , foreign divinities were imported under the name of a native divinity , with a distinguishing surname . In Arcadia , various alien goddesses , which were identified as Artemis , each with a distinguishing surname , were borrowed from their original cults and remained separate goddesses . In some cases the surnames were not derived from the place of origin but signified characteristics ascribed to the divinities . Of this order were the names of Zeus Savior , Artemis Savior , Zeus the Friendly , and Artemis 13rauronia ( of the bear ) . The nature of the surname , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given the same name distinct from each other . It is possible that if Mediterranean paganism had continued for another thousand years , the chaos of polytheism would have been reduced . The organization of the greater gods and goddesses into a family was a step in that direction , and the nominal identification of a number of great gods under the name of Zeus ' was another step . Earlier assimilation of divinities had helped a little but not much . The tendency in all religions is first to multiply divinities and later to reduce the number by systematization . It is possible
