txt British , New Zealand , Australian and Netherland fliers under the Royal Air Force command continued widespread and highly successful night and day operations over Germany and German-occupied France m the twenty-four hours through this evening , letting the enemy know once again that British spokesmen meant business when they said with the return of good flying weather the Nazis would be raidei. right around the clock . The R. A. F. squadrons lost four bombers in heavy raids on Cologne and elsewhere in Reich territory last night , but in a fierce daylight offensive over France that followed , they destroyed ten Nazi fighter planes without a single loss to themselves . A Berlin report , heard over the radio here , said one British bomber was shot down at Cologne and civilian casualties were caused by the attack there and that eight R A. F. planes were destroyed by th : German fighters in daylight battler over the Channel coast . London Has False Raid Alarm Toward midnight Londoners heard , for the first time in months , the lone wail of an air raid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planes were near London and the alarm was a false one , possibly set off by a short circuit . No Nazi planes were over Britain all day . The chief objective of the Friday night bombing raids was the Rhineland industrial center of Cologne , which had last been visited by the R. A. F. on Friday , Feb. 13 . Many high explosives were dropped , some of them being what air officials have described as the R. A. F. 's " beautiful big bombs , " which are of terrific blasting power . The Air Ministry communiqu ? said many vast fires were started in the Cologne area , but it did not indicate what specific targets were hit . The raid was the 104th made by the R. A. F. on Cologne . During the night other British bombers hammered airfields , some in Western Germany and some in Belgium and the Netherlands , 1 while still ' other planes planted mines in enemy waters . Fierce dogfights at altitudes of 4,000 to 7,000 feet took place in the daylight sweeps of swarms of R. A. F. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the admittedly speedy and hard-hitting Messerschmitts . One of the enemy planes shot down was of the new Focke-Wulf fighter type . The battles occurred when the German fighters tried to prevent the British from making offensive patrols and harrying attacks on plants and military stations in the occupied French territory . One R. A. F. squadron that had distinguished itself during the Battle of Britain in the Fall of 1940 spotted during the day 's operations ten Messerschmitts flying almost at sea level far below . The British swooped upon the enemy with cannons blazing . The Messerschmitts made a lightning dart for the clouds in an attempt to get away , but they were not quick enough . The R. A. F. pilots sent eight of the foe hurtling into the sea and the two that escaped were seen to have been hit . While this fight was going on another group of R. A. F. planes overtook eight Messerschmitts and a Focke-Wulf craft and fought it out with them . One Messerschmitt was destroyed before the Nazi squadron decided it had had enough . Later in the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of another R. A. F. sweep . None of the R. A. F. pilots taking part in the day 's engagements with the Germans suffered even a scratch , Air Ministry officials said . Netherland , Australian and New Zealand fliers were among those sharing honors for bagging Nazi planes . - As the British bombers roared out toward the Continent Friday night , one Nazi bomber , apparently taking a chance that it would be mistaken for an R. A. F. machine , sneaked across to ftngland . It dropped a string of bombs near a southeast coast town . All the explosives burst harmlessly in the open countryside except one that fell among houses injuring one person and damaging some dwellings . The Air Ministry reported that , in offensive operations by the R. A. F. Fighter Command since last Sunday , twenty-six enemy planes had been struck down for a loss of twelve British planes . Civilian air raid casualties in Britain during February were reported by the Ministry of Home Security as twenty-two persons killed and twenty-one injured and hospitalized.         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
