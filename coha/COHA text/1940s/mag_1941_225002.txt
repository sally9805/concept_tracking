By last week the German Army had achieved a great new margin of superiority in tanks . <P> Lord Beaverbrook told Britain and the U.S. : " The Russians believe that the Germans at the start of the campaign against them had 30,000 tanks , and in the present offensive against Moscow 14,000 are being employed . " The Russians had 14,000 tanks left . Their total was probably under 10,000 on the whole front , probably no more than half that many on the Moscow front . <P> When a New York Times correspondent wrote of the Moscow battle , he did not refer to great tank skirmishes such as had taken place in the earlier battles . He wrote instead : " The Russians are destroying hundreds of tanks with guns , grenades and gasoline-filled bottles . " <P> Battlewagon Warfare . Germany and Russia began the war with approximately equal strength in tanks . How had Germany achieved the apparent 14-to-5 advantage in tank force before Moscow ? <P> Partly , of course , by strategy-by drawing Russian strength aside , especially into the Ukraine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developed anti-tank artillery technique . But mostly because of the difference between the German and Russian conceptions of the purpose of tanks . <P> The German tank technique is largely based on Der Kampfwagenkrieg ( Battlewagon Warfare , 1935 ) by General Ludwig Ritter von Eimannsberger . The essence of the Eimannsberger thesis boils down to this : The tank is exclusively a weapon of large-scale strategic offensive , in no case of small-scale tactical attack , counterattack or defense . For defense against tanks , General von Eimannsberger devised a pattern of anti-tank guns in three rows-a six , twelve , six defense-covering a front about a mile and a half wide . Such a defense , he figured , would be able to knock out at least 54 tanks before being overcome itself . <P> To break through with tanks , he suggested using three successive waves , behind which would pour infantry attackers to maintain their breach . This system calls for tight concentration of tanks into vast breaching units-e.g. , the four Panzer Armies which have made the big breaks in Russia . <P> Russia , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the French conception : tanks should be used as roving pillboxes in support of infantry . Thus Russia had no great tank armies , but spread its large number of tanks all through its infantry armies , squandered them little by little in defensive actions and minor counterattacks . <P> Said Adolf Hitler in his secret Order of the Day opening the Battle of Moscow : " Thanks to your bravery , my comrades , we succeeded in barely three months in crushing this opponent 's tank brigades one after another . . . .
