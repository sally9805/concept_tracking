Since his nation 's surrender in 1945 , Emperor Hirohito has been shifting from a divine to a human monarch . In his new role , the ex-god makes frequent tours among his people . Last week , as Hirohito visited the southern island of Kyushu , the changed relationship between the ruler and the ruled became increasingly and significantly apparent . Cabled TIME Correspondent Frank Gibney : <P> The smiling crowds spilled everywhere . The sidewalks and street corners of Nagasaki were blocked as far as eye could see with politel jostling people , carrying glossy paper Japanese flags , waiting for the first glimpse of Hirohito 's aging maroon Packard . <P> Preceded by a modest automobile escort , it came at last down streets reverberating with banzais . At one place the crowd made a quick spontaneous rush from the curb , almost surrounding the imperial car . Nodding happily to them and waving his shapeless grey hat with the flourish of an old campaigner , Hirohito looked more like a successful and extroverted political leader than the scared sovereign he was in 1945 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schoolgirls giggled nervously . A middle-aged man in a grey kimono lustily waved a frayed pith helmet , a relic of the army 's Pacific salad days , while tears coursed from his eyes . A gnarled old woman stared fixedly , saying over &; over in a choked voice , " li des-it is good . " The react ! n. had been the same in farming villages , coal mines , industrial areas-wherever the glossy , chrysanthemum-decked imperial train chugged its way . <P> The Poised . Before the triumphal entry , the local folk spent long hours sprucing up the vicinity . Said an amazed G.I. jeep driver , noting that old holes in the road near Nagasaki had been filled in : " I hope this guy comes here more often . This is the first comfortable ride I 've had . " Schoolchildren swept streets and sidewalks with small brooms hours before the Emperor was scheduled to pass . This practice - ; led Japanese Communists and many Americans to speak of Hirohito as hoki san , or " the broom . " <P> Although to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his bows and headshakings is still something of a comic figure , his Japanese subjects now call him ochitsuite ( poised-and-at-his-ease ) -a high personal compliment . Hirohito 's /ords are few , but well chosen and sometimes surprising . To union bosses at Nagasaki 's big Mitsubishi heavy-industry plant , he said warningly , " Thank you for your cooperation . I hope you will work for a healthy labor union . " To coal miners , he appealed , " I should like to ask you to produce much more . " To the children of the Catholic Holy Mother Orphanage at Omura , he admonished , " Work hard , pray to Jesus Christ , and grow to be good men . "
