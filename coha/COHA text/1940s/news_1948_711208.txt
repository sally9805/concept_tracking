txt Two men were killed and two others were seriously burned yesterday when a gas explosion and flash fire transformed a threestory building into a roofless , windowless shell in less than an hour . The explosion , which sent at ' least six persons to the hospital , occurred in a gas producing plant of the Kings County Lighting Company , at First Avenue and Fiftyfifth Street , near the Brooklyn waterfront . Fearful that flames might envelop a gas storage tank at the rear of the building , the firemen ' turned in three alarms in twelve minutes and fought the flames from the top of the tank . Not until the blaze was extinguished did officials of the gas company reveal ' that the tank had been empty . From 2 P. M. , when the explosion shattered windows in factories of this industrial section of Brooklyn , until nearly 4.30 P. M. , firemen not only fought the flames but also scrutinized wreckage in the building because it was reported that four persons had been Itrapped inside .

The plant 1 had been shut down two and a // SCENE OF EXPLOSION AND FIRE IN ** YESTERDAY Firemen fighting blaze in plant of the Kings County Lighting Company Tile New York Times GAS BLAST KILLS 2 IN BROOKLYN PLANT // half hours earlier to permit installation of the meter . The search for the bodies was complicated by the fact that just before the explosion some of the I workmen left the meter room and went into the alley for relief from gas fumes . About the same time other men , who had finished another project , entered the room to see how the meter job was progressing . Consequently , when the explosion occurred , firemen and company officials were unable , for several hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building . One of the dead men , Edward O'Hehir , 28 years old , of 551 Fiftyninth Street , Brooklyn , had been working as a watchman in the vicinity , but , other workers said , he was on hand because he was taking his father 's place during the latter 's illness . The other dead man was Michael Gillen , 40 , of 668 Seventy-eighth Street , Brooklyn . Like Mr. O'Hehir , Mr. Gillen was burned beyond recognition .

The explosion , which was heard a quarter of a mile away at the Brooklyn Army Base ' of the New York Port of Embarkation , brought medical help from that point and ambulances and doctors from five hospitals . Several hours after the explosion , Sebastian A. Petrino , production engineer for the Kings County Lighting Company , said that customers had not been deprived of gas because arrangements had been made for them to be supplied by another company while the meter was being in , stalled . The company serves 150 , - 1000 persons in the Bath Beach , Bay Ridge , Bensonhurst and Flatbush sections of Brooklyn . According to Chief Fire Marshal Thomas P. Brophy , the meter I was to measure the gas produced before it was released into a 30-inch main that carried it to a compressor . From the compressor the gas was fed into the company 's tanks at Sixty-fifth Street and Ninth Avenue , Brooklyn . Mr. Brophy said there was no doubt that gas had seeped into the room . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off by a bunsen burner in the laboratory on the floor above . However , he did not know if that floor was being used at the time . Furthermore , the floors are separated by reinforced concrete . Another possibility offered by the Fire Marshal was that a spark from a tool caused the blast . Deputy Fire Chief Edward M. F. Conway suggested that the twelveinch , reinforced brick walls of the building might not have been left standing if there had not been so much window space . More than half of the front of the building was devoted to the three windows on each floor facing First lAvenue These windows permitted easy escape of pressure when the ilgas exploded . There were many reports of rescues and at least halfa dozen ' persons claimed to have removed the dead men either from the bundling or the alley . Pedestrians a block from the building said they had been thrown to the street by the explosion . Indicative of the impact of the blast were bent iron bars on the windows .
