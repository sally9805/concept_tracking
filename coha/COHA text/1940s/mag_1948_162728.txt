" When I paint , " Pablo Picasso once said , " my object is to show what I have found , and not what I am looking for . In art , intentions are not sufficient and , as we say in Spanish , love must be proved by facts and not by reasons . " A new edition of Verve , in U.S. bookstores last week , showed proofs of Picasso 's recent finds and loves . <P> The paintings and drawings , done on the Riviera in 1946 , had none of the nightmare violence that characterized Picasso 's wartime work . Goats , nymphs , centaurs , children and satyrs , drawn loosely in dancing lines or painted with soft smears of cool color , sang and played pipes , swam , fished , ate dinner and slept under the trees . The one warlike note was a comic-strip series of sketches showing a duel between centaurs , which ended with the loser crumpled across a broken arrow and the horned winner looking downcast . The figures were almost all distorted , but never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to spring from inner drunkenness rather than artistic rage . Picasso had pulled and twisted their limbs like taffy , but in making them pinheaded , they also seemed agreeably lightheaded . <P> A stunt pilot of painting , Picasso , now 66 , has made some of the fastest , furthest flights , most resounding forced landings and crashes in art history . He can also , as the new Verve demonstrates , make short , slow , sweet canoe trips when he chooses .
