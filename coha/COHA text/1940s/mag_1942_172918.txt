U.S. parents and churchmen alike had a right to rub their eyes in wonder last week at the news from Britain . In the U.S. almost every State makes it a crime to give sectarian instruction in the public schools , but within a few weeks Parliament will actually make religious instruction and daily worship a statutory requirement for every school in the United Kingdom . <P> Surprising as this British move seems today , the passage of such a law would have seemed even more surprising to men of earlier generations-for exactly opposite reasons . For centuries Christianity and education went hand in hand . Throughout the Middle Ages education was so exclusively the domain of the church that any prisoner who could read was recognized as a cleric ( clerk ) and could get his case transferred to the more lenient ecclesiastical courts . Every great university in Britain and the U.S. was founded with strong religious motives , largely to educate ministers . And until the last century the idea of education without religious instruction was as novel as the idea of travel without a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present drive for religion in British schools started with a leader in the London Times . Shortly after World War II began the Times lamented that " in a country professedly Christian , and a country which at the moment is staking its all in defense of Christian principles , there is a system of national education which allows the citizens of the future to have a purely heathen upbringing . " <P> Evacuation of British city children proved an eye opener to the families who sheltered them . For example , one survey showed that three out of-every five evacuees had no idea who was born on Christmas or why Christmas was celebrated , " knew absolutely nothing of the Bible and had never been taught to pray . " <P> Both the Church of England and Nonconformist sects joined in the drive to put religion into the schools . Even the Roman Catholics approved the move . Gone were the inter-church squabbles that helped secularize British and American schools in the first place . <P> Last summer 224 British peers and members of Parliament signed a manifesto " that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian education that his citizenship shall become the expression of these principles in action . " Last month the House of Commons took time off from discussion of the war for a lengthy debate on religious education . <P> Result : the churches and Britain 's Board of Education are now collaborating to draft an act making worship and religious instruction compulsory and providing a Government inspector of religious education ( i.e. , bringing religious teaching up to scratch ) .
