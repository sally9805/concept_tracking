txt The basis will be established soon by the Securities and Exchange Commission for a legal test of Section 11 ( the " death sentence " provision ) of the Public Utility Act of 1935 . It will come in the form of an opinion by the SEC holding that the Engineers Public Service Co. is not entitled to hold two or more widely separated utility systems . This will be the first formal action of that nature to be taken by the SEC since the Public Utility Act became law . There have been several tentative findings along the line now expected to become final . Recent C. &; S. Decision Forerunner Intimation that such an opinion will be forthcoming soon was given by the SEC in a decision recently handed down against Commonwealth &; Southern Corp . barring that corporation from submitting expert valuation testimony in the corporate simplification proceedings brought by the Commission against that holding company . In that order the SEC suggested that Commonwealth &; Southern must be limited to one integrated system even though the issues involved in the integration proceedings against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasons , however . for such an apparently arbitrary statement in a footnote which read : " This interpretation of Section 11(b) ( 1 ( 13 I has been fully considered by us and adopted in connection with another matter now pending . Engineers Public Service Co. et al. , File No. 59-4 . Our opinion thereon is to be issued within a few days . " The section referred to is the Big " B " of the A. B and C provisions of Section 11 of the Public Utility Act . Big B is one of the so-called standards that have to be satisfied . It requires that all the additional systems that can be retained by a holding company must be located in one state in which the principal system operates , or in one or more adjoining states or in a contiguous foreign country . The Engineers Public Service Co. has been the only holding company to present formal argument before the SEC as to what the Big kt provision should be interpreted to mean . In its argument the company has endeavored to show that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Company With 2 Alternatives The forthcoming SEC order will leave the company with but two alternatives  --  litigation or liquidation . It already has indicated that it would fight any SEC dismemberment order Furthermore since its fight intimations , the company lost all companionship in its firm stand against the SEC when Commonwealth &; Southern Corp . capitulated to the SEC 's wishes for dismemberment . - The SEC already has hinted that under fun Utility Act compliance there would be no need tor a holding company such.a.s Engineers . In a tentative order issued sonic time ago the SEC held that the company should divest itself of all but one integrated system . It suggested that Engineers holdings be confined either to the Gulf States Utilities Co. or the Virginia Electric &; Power Co . That would mean the company would to dispose of its holdings in El Paso Electric . operating in Texas and New Mexico ; Western Public Service , owning properties in Wyoming . South Dakota , Nebraska . Colorado , Kansas , Missouri and Iowa ; Puget Sound Power &; Light . in Washington ; Savannah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Florida . To that list also would have to be added one of the two alternatives ? Virginia or Gulf States  --  suggested by the SEC as major system possibilities . Hearings on for Two Months Hearings on the SEC 's dismemberment plan for Engineers have been under way before the commission for more than two months . The company , counsel said on one occasion , disagreed completely with the SEC 's interpretation of the death sentence . The Engineers management interprets the act to permit the ownership of more than one integrated system whether adjoining or widely separated . The company 's conviction in that regard was outlined to stockholders shortly before the SEC hearings started , by D. C Barnes , president . Engineers , he said , expects to show that the requirements of Section 11 ( ' ' death sentence " or integration provision ) would be met if the company continued to control the properties of Virginia Electric &; Power Co. , Gulf States Utilities Co. and El Paso Electric Co . To date the proceedings before the SEC have been confined to arguments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proceeding , and the one from which court litigation may spring , is still to come . That will have to do with the presentation of evidence of an economic and factual nature to demonstrate the value of holding company management . So far apparently the commission procedure has not permitted such testimony . Engineers Public Service belongs to the small group of holding companies that would have values left for the common stocks in the event of forced dissolution under the holding company act . Capitalizing the 1940 earnings of subsidiaries ( except Puget Sound Power &; Light i at 10 times would give a value for these equities of around $53,001 , , 000 . Engineers preferred stock would be entitled to $42.301,500 in the event of involuntary liquidation . In addition . Engineers had cash and other assets totaling more than $8,000,000 at the end of 1940 . Thus there is indicated on the basis of such calculations a value of more than $8 a share for Engineers , 1,909,968 common shares .
