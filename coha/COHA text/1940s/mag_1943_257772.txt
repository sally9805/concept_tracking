Two nights a week , promptly at 6 p.m. , a small , slight man wearing a sweater and overalls over grey slacks checks in at a British arms factory . For three hours he works at a bench turning out parts for R.A.F. guns . His foreman calls him " proficient . " His people call him George VI , by the Grace of God , of Great Britain , Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seas King , Defender of the Faith , Emperor of India . <P> Britons , proud of their ruler 's gesture of wartime solidarity with the working classes , were told last week how the King got his job . On an official inspection tour of the factory , the King asked how long it would take to learn to operate one of the machines . " That depends entirely on your aptitude , sir , " he was told . The King took off his coat . " I think I 'll start at once , " he said . He did .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
