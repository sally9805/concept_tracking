Until businessmen show heart and sympathy as well as ability and show a genuine desire to reduce the anxieties and , problems of the workers in this country they will continue to be distrusted and ignored on the public questions for which their experience and judgment is peculiarly suited . And they will be voted out of influence accordingly in a democracy that only requires 51% to name its officers and pass its laws . <P> These soberly humanitarian words were spoken last week , not by a New Dealer but by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce chairman who was Herbert Hoover 's right-hand man in fighting the depression 13 years ago . Julius Howland Barnes is 69 now , and long since retired from the grain business in which he was once the biggest U.S. exporter . But last week he came back &gt; into the news again with a plan for improving labor relations by giving first call on jobs to the neediest workmen-and paying them the union scale of $51 for a 60-hour shipyard week-even if they had never before earned half that much . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his shipyards for 169 men who were almost down &; out , and he was well pleased with the result . As for his labor force , the A.F. of L. local leaders said there was not a plant in the U.S. with a better cooperative spirit . <P> Good Heart . When Julius Barnes went back to Duluth from Manhattan to reopen his old shipyard last November , 3,000 men lined up for jobs . Many were hired for their special skills , but to pick his other labor he enlisted the aid of the Junior Chamber of Commerce and gave them a professional investigator . <P> The C. of C. members went all over town talking to grocers , butchers , relief agencies , dredging up down &; outers . The paid investigator tracked applicants to their homes to see if their wives knew how to keep clean and thrifty house . Practically none of the 169 finally hired in this way had ever earned more than $25 a week ; one had twelve children ; another had been hospitalized for so long he had lost touch with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or three proved disappointing , " Barnes reported last week , " the others have taken a new lease on life . Many of them have been upgraded into semiskilled jobs ; others have won bonuses for ideas for plant improvement . They are all working hard and are happy , and we are functioning without labor trouble . " He has a closed A.F. of L. shop in his 800-man shipbuilding plant in Duluth , a closed C.I.O. shop in his nearby Klearflax Linen Looms , Inc. ( which not only makes linen rugs but , for three years , has enriched itself with a new process for treating coarse flax fiber for cigaret paper ) . What 's more , he believes the closed shop is the best way for an employer to avoid " a fighting , quarreling type of labor leadership . "
