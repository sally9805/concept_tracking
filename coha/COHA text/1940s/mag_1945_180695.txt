General Charles de Gaulle sent word to the fuming , frustrated Consultative Assembly : gladly would he confer with them about his Ministers . Into his presence trooped some three dozen leaders of France 's advisory parliament . <P> Politely the General listened . He had heard their complaints before . Justice Minister Franois de Menthon was too reluctant in purging collaborationists , too lax in setting up adequate tribunals . Food Minister Paul Ramadier was too slow in allaying hunger , too inefficient in building up a distribution system . Information Minister Pierre Henri Teitgen was too partial in distributing newsprint , too sluggish in breaking up the paper trusts . The Government had not removed these men . Gravely Assembly Speaker Felix Gouin observed : " Our deliberations are useless if no heed is paid to them . . . . " <P> The General smiled ironically . He gave the impression of laughing a little inside . " You are not elected , " he replied . " And neither am I. You , like my own Government , represent something not quite definite . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get along until popular suffrage has decided for us all . " <P> Then he added , pleasantly : even if the Assembly unanimously condemned one of his Ministers or one of his policies , he would not necessarily make a change . And if the municipal elections , scheduled between April and June , showed that the Assembly did not represent the political character of the country , he would enlarge its membership accordingly . <P> Leftist Assemblyman Pierre Villon commented : " We are in a most awkward position . Popular opinion holds many of us responsible for the failures of the Cabinet . " <P> The General smiled his most pointed smile . " All right ! I have no objection to making a public statement that Monsieur Pierre Villon is in no way responsible for what my Government does or does not do . " <P> Next day , as good as his word , the General publicly declared : " Until universal suffrage shall be operating , I , alone , am responsible before the country . " <P> The Assembly went back to talking in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face of the General 's integrity , prestige and stubbornness ? Full well they knew that they could carry their point ( or lose it altogether ) only at the polls-and that there could be no general election until the 3,000,000 Frenchmen now prisoners in Germany had come home .
