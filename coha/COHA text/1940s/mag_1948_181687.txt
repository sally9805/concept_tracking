At the age of six , Peng Teh-huai attacked his schoolmaster with a stool . Three years later , young Peng deliberately kicked over his grandmother 's opium , which was cooking on the stove , and was banished from the family . Last week , at 48 , Peng Teh-huai , as the second ranking general of Communist China , was still going strong . He was basking in kudos from the Communist Central Committee for the " brilliant victory " he had scored over a Nationalist force at Ichuan , 60 miles southeast of Yenan . <P> Nationalist intelligence had learned a month ago that General Peng was ready to " establish merit " in the northwest . Nationalist planes , based at Sian , were alerted to watch for Red movements . Late in February , near Hangcheng , 5,000 Reds were spotted crossing the Yellow River in dozens of junks . The force headed for the Yellow Dragon mountains in southeast Shensi , where they joined another 4,000 Communists . Down from north Shensi came more . By month 's end , General Peng @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yenan , Nationalist General Hu Tsung-nan decided to beat the Communists to the punch . Two army divisions , under Generals Liu Kan and Yen Ming , marched south . West of Ichuan they met the Red force . Six hours later the Nationalists had suffered 20,000 casualties . Only 2,000 soldiers escaped . Both General Liu and General Yen lay dead . <P> The news from Manchuria was almost as bad as the Shensi catastrophe . Kirin , a fat prize with its huge Hsiaofengmen hydroelectric plant ( power source for Changchun and Mukden industries ) , fell to the Reds . Then , after an eleven-day onslaught , the Reds took Szepingkai . Only Mukden and Changchun held out . When they fell , 300,000 more Red soldiers could plunge south into the heart of China . <P> In Nanking , the government mourned . The " valiant action " at Ichuan would be " sung and wept over in history as ... a demonstration of the revolutionary spirit of sacrifice of the national troops . . . . Such spirit . . . will insure that Communist bandits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But it would take more than a spirit of sacrifice to stop the Red march in China .
