Like many a mere man , James Madison Wood likes to say that a woman is a woman . What makes his truism noteworthy is his insistence on applying it to women 's education . After all , says he , 72% of all women ultimately marry . As president of Missouri 's Stephens College ( for women ) , Dr. Wood has trained 2,000 young women in the arts &; sciences of wifehood , motherhood and homemaking . Even the college 's psychology , literature and economics courses are , as he says , " geared . . . to its homemaking objective . " He seems to be on the right track , for at last count 85% of the Stephens " Susies " land a man within five years of graduation . <P> Though critics accuse Stephens girls of spending more time on their lipstick than on their Latin , amiable Dr. Wood has built the college from a 1912 enrollment of 52 ( and a $100,000 deficit ) into a thriving academy that picks &; chooses its lucky girls . Stephens has had such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dramatics teacher . Talent scouts-who are called " admissions counselors " - give prospects the onceover , report ( among other things ) on their " comeliness " and home-town popularity . Stephens prefers not to waste its makeup , clothing and budget clinics , its courses in nutrition and home management , on the hopelessly homely or the misfits . <P> Stephens girls generally learn quite a bit about horses , planes , and the Bible . They attend the world 's largest collegiate Bible class ( with choir and orchestra ) . The college has a $75,000 riding arena , with 45 horses , and an aviation program with 30 planes . A faculty committee on " education by travel " is now planning a revival of the well-publicized continental grand tours Stephens girls took before the war . <P> Last week 71-year-old Dr. Wood decided that " thirty-five years of living with 2,000 women is all any man is entitled to . . . . " As his successor , Stephens curators picked popular Homer Price Rainey , 50 , ousted president of the University of Texas and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to spend six months at Stephens before he says what he thinks about it all .
