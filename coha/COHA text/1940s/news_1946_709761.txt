txt We are indebted to one of our readers for calling attention to a gem of British bureaucracy which loses nothing in luster if set beside our own domestic product . It is from a vnIumA published in London last year called " Law and Orders , " an inquiry into the nature and scope of delegated legislation and executive powers in England by Carleton Kemp Allen , formerly Professor of Jurisprudence in the University of Oxford and now warden of Rhodes House , Oxford . Mr. Allen vouches for the authenticity of the following letter from the Board of Trade : Making of Civilian Clothing ( Restrictions ) Order , 1942 ( S. R. &; 0 . 1942 . No. 541 ) I am to refer to your letter dated 1st March in which you make application for a licence to permit of a suit being made having more pockets than those laid down in the above-mentioned Order . It is noted that you do not require more than two pockets in the trousers , and that you would like , instead of the third pocket , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am to say that the Board are not prepared to consider the giving up of a pocket in one garment sufficient reason for the granting of an extra pocket in another garment , since the restrictions are imposed on the separate garment and not on the suit as a whole . The Board realize , however , that in certaiir circumstances it may be necessary to vary the restrictions and if you would state why you are unable to make use of the third pocket in the trousers ( it is not necessary that this pocket should be a hip-pocket , the restrictions do not in any way refer to the position of pockets but only to the total number in each garment ) , thus necessitating the extra jacket pocket , full consideration will be given to the issue of a licence . It would also be helpful If you were able to state the exact use to which the extra pockets you require in the . jacket and waistcoat are to be put . With regard to your request for a small subdivision in the right side pocket of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not regarded as an extra pocket and that no licence will therefore be necessary in respect of this requirement . The name and address of your tailor should also be stated in order that if a licence is issued it may be sent to him . Mr. Alien says that the final irony is added to the farce when , " after years of this kind of thing , the whole mumbojumbo of pockets and side pockets and sub-pockets is abandoned , for the excellent reason that it was never worth while at any time . " It is to be hoped , he adds , that the official who wrote this letter " was aware of its inanity ? he would be scarcely human if he were not . But he is not responsible ; he is only doing his duty . Nobody is responsible . It is merely the System at work . This is the aspect of bureaucracy which is most repellent to the citizen . The thing with which he has to deal is just a vast force , unseen , impersonal , unimpassioned , intangible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual . "
