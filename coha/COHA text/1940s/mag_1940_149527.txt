Fifty years a Salvationist this week was Alexander Martin Damon , the only U. S.-born officer ever to become a territorial commander with the rank of commissioner , second highest rank in the Salvation Army . Commissioner Damon commands the Army 's biggest single province , the Eastern Territory ( New England , New York , New Jersey , Pennsylvania , Delaware , Ohio ) . He and his wife , who heads the district 's Home League , are one of the few Army couples to be paid as much as $30 a week for their joint work . Many an archbishop supervises a smaller domain than Commissioner Damon 's , with its 700 Army posts , 8,000 bandsmen and singers , 35,000 soldiers , annual budget of $1,600,000 in New York City alone . <P> " Soup , soap and salvation " was the motto of the Army 's fiery-eyed founder , General William Booth . The Salvationists whom thriving young Grocer Damon heard in Lowell , Mass , in the ' 80s were so poor they could offer only the last . Damon thought that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he recalls of his early years as trombone in an Army band . At Quincy , Mass , the whole band was once arrested for disturbing the peace . The others were sentenced to 30 days in jail but 16-year-old Damon was overlooked because he was so small . <P> Soon Salvationist Damon switched to soul-saving . His steady rise to the Eastern commissionership in 1935 paralleled the Army 's own growth in the U. S .. Commissioner Damon , with piercing blue eyes , shock of white hair and resonant voice , played a leading role in that change . Since 1893 he has traveled 1,099,787 miles , spoken at countless thousands of meetings , made thousands of converts . Last month 900 sinners came forward at his meetings . <P> Founder Booth made autocracy a prime part of the Army 's tradition and Commissioner Damon has a control that verges on the absolute . He has charge of his terri tory 's budget , initiates programs , promotes and transfers officers , has full disciplinary power over them . " We have rules , " says he , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers ' lives should be kept apart . " Officers can not smoke , use alcohol , go to the theatre . Since the choice of a mate requires the approval of their superiors , nearly all of them marry within the ranks , rear another generation of Salvationists . Mrs. Commissioner Damon was Captain Annie Barrow before her marriage . The Damons ' daughter , Mrs. Adjutant Lyell Rader of Newark , is an active Army officer too . <P> " People used to think of us as working only among drunkards and harlots , " says Commissioner Damon . But the Army works wherever it gets the chance . In Pittsburgh last week Commissioner Damon got a bouquet of flowers from a Jew who has given a dollar a day to the Army ever since World War I because it was kind to him when he was a doughboy . " You see , " the Commissioner said happily , " you cast your bread on the waters and you never know how or when it will come back . "         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
