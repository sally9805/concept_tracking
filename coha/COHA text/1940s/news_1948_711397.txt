txt Rebellious Southern Democrats , waving the flag of " white supremacy " and boasting an assured twenty Electoral College votes in Mississippi and Alabama , announced today that they would carry " a fighting campaign " to defeat President Truman into neighboring states . J. Strom Thurmond , ? Governor of South Carolina and Presidential choice of the disgruntled Democrats on a " states ' rights " ticket , was prepared to start a speechmaking campaign covering the solid South , the border states and " the backyards of President Truman and his running mate , Senator Alben Barkley . " Meanwhile , there were mounting indications that party " regulars , " political bosses and even former " states ' rights " enthusiasts were ready to dash cold water on the new ticket 's hopes to gain support from a region that has solidly supported the Democratic party since Reconstruction days , except for the splintering in the Al Smith campaign of 1928 . Laney Opposes " Revenge " Foremost in political significance among those who were taking a cautious attitude toward the Dixie " revolt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was openly reported to he the favorite for President of the states ' rights leaders up to a few hours before they selected Governor Thurmond . Governor Laney , who remained in his hotel room yesterday rather than attend the states ' rights nominating convention , issued a typewritten statement that went to the heart of the struggle ahead for the new party by declaring , " Whatever is done must be done through and by the official Democratic organization in each respective state . " Governor Laney said that he had offered his recommendation that the political dispute be kept within the party ranks to the leaders of the states ' rights party as " a plea and a position " which would be his for " the present and the future . " He emphasized his belief that the South was right in opposing the civil rights proposals in the Democratic party platform adopted at the national convention in Philadelphia , but added that " the spirit of obstinacy and revenge is not the spirit of the Southland . " Warns on Permanent Split He referred to yesterday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the outcome of the Birmingham meeting will be . " He then added that the results of the Civil War " even unto this day are well remembered " and pleaded for action to avoid " a permanent division of our people . " Governor Laney has been a leader in the Southern opposition to the civil rights proposals introduced in January by President Truman . He was named chairman of the first States ' Rights Democrats meeting on May 10 in Jackson , Miss . At the national convention in Philadelphia he announced his candidacy for the Presidential nomination but withdrew before balloting time . Newspaper editorials in key southern cities today largely took a dim view of the wisdom of the " revolt " and the creation of a fourth party , but expressed sympathy with the feelings of those who insisted that the civil rights proposals had angered them to the point of rebellion . There was wide discussion of the possibility that yesterday 's convention , with speakers emphasizing the tenets of white supremacy and " the threats of racial intermingling , " would add to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy Negro voting strength . It was also being pointed out that recognized leaders of political machines , such as Edward H. ( Boss ) Crump of Tennessee , Senator Harry F. Byrd of Virginia , Herman Talmadge of Georgia and Gov . Earl K. Long of Louisiana , had declined to take part in the convention and had not sent any emissaries . The first strong vocal demon- stration on the floor of the convention yesterday came when a speaker scored " the office-holders of the South " for not taking part in the revolt , This was taken as an admission that the new party realized its lack of organization strength based on political patronage . However , the leaders of the new party remained undaunted in the face of the political hurdles they must clear . and they were prepared to return to their home states " to prove that we 've done the right thing here for the good of the South . " The grand strategy of the states ' rights Democrats is to go into the Southern and border states on a white supremacy issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politicians to manipulate the state machinery so that Presidential electors favorable to the states ' rights candidates will be pledged . There is admittedly a twofold purpose to this scheme . First , to defeat President as a symbol of civil ights proposals that are " inimical " to the South , and , secondly , to display enough political strength to be recognized I as " the real minority party " in Congress and thus take over the committee posts that will enable them to block civil rights legislation in that body . The states-righters are setting their sights on 138 electoral votes in the South and . forty-three electoral votes in border states which 1they believe are " on the fence " because of Mr. Truman 's " general unpopularity " and the fact that in those states the racial segregation pattern is practiced . Alabama Court Backs . Rebels There appeared no doubt about the present support of the Presidential electors in Alabama and Mississippi . Eleven in Alabama are pledged against President Truman and the Alabama Supreme Court has held that such pledges are not in violation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nominee of the - Democratic party . The nine electors of Mississippi are pledged to vote for someone other than President Truman . There is strong political unity behind the states ' rights movement in Mississippi ; that state 's Governor , Fielding L. Wright , is the Vice Presidential choice on the states ' rights ticket . There is a strong move under way by liberal leaders such as Senator Lister Hill of Alabama to draw the state back into the paths of party regularity . No such move is reported in Mississippi . It was recalled that in 1944 the Mississippi electors were pledged against the Democratic party nominee , Franklin D. Roosevelt , because of a civil rights plank . Four days before the election a special session of the Legislature was called and a slate of unpledged electors was named . The state remained in the Roosevelt column . There appears no likelihood of such an occurrence this time , but many were recalling it as an indication that in politics anything can happen up to the last minute as long as those in charge of party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this connection it was also stressed that the states ' rights convention yesterday set October as the date for a return meeting at which the extent of success in obtaining Presidential electors . in various states would be ascertained . It could him . develop into a " harmony meeting " if the states ' rights movement collapses , and steps could be taken for returning to party regularity . A spot check showed that Louisiana has ten electoral votes that are not pledged against Mr. Truman and it seems unlikely that they will be , with Governor Long in complete control of the state after an election that set a record for vote-capturing . Crump Sends No Emissaries Tennessee has twelve electoral votes , and although Boss Crump has announced his disapproval of Mr. Truman , it was noted that ' he sent no emissaries to yesterday 's convention . At the first states ' rights meeting Mayor Jim Pleasants of Memphis and Col. Roane Waring , Memphis utility president , were present . Georgia has twelve electoral ' voters to be chosen and it is quite evident that both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M. E. Thompson and his opponent , Herman Talmadge , are decidedly cool I to the states ' rights movement . Florida has eight electoral ' votes , four of them pledged against Mr. Truman and four of them reported to be " on the fence . " Three of the electors were at yesterday 's convention and it seemed likely they would go along with the states ' rights ticket if it showed real strength over a period of time . Texas has twenty-three electoral voters to be chosen in convention in a month . Three to five Of the Texas delegates to the national convention were at yesterday 's meeting , but indications were that Senator Tom Connally and Representative Sam Rayburn would make a winning fight to keep Texas " regular . " Arkansas has nine electoral votes to be chosen in convention and - Governor Laney 's action seemed a strong indication that the Democratic organization there would pledge its electors to the party 's nominee . Virginia has eleven electoral votes already chosen and pledged to the Democratic party nominee and it seemed unlikely that Senator Byrd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights ticket . Thurmond in State Dispute South Carolina has eight electoral voters to be named by the State Democratic executive committee . Opinion was that Governor Thurmond would appeal strongly to them , but at the same time he is involved in an intra-party dispute in which the upland counties have enrolled Negro voters in defiance of state convention rules and he may lose control of the convention forces . North Carolina has fourteen electoral voters to be named in convention and there appears no chance of them being pledged to the States ' Righters , as North Carolina stood more firmly behind President Truman at the national convention than any other Southern state . Oklahoma ' has ten electoral voters , Maryland has eight , Missouri has fifteen and Kentucky has eleven , all to be chosen in conventions . The states ' righters admit that they hope to make a showing in these states by an appeal to the danger of civil rights legislation In regard to segregation practices . Their chances seem very small . In many of these states there are statutory and constitutional previsions requiring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case of Alabama . In each case a court action could be brought if the electors were pledged to the states ' rights candidates , and each state 's court might rule differently . Many observers of the convention were still dubious of the basic political strength involved . There was unquestioned strength , in the demonstrations on the convention floor , but most of the shouting sad parading was done by college stu dents , who seemed to be having a wonderful time . Also , other than Mississippi and - Alabama , which had their national convention walkout delegates present , there was no other showing of " delegates " Who yield such a position because of an expressed will of voters. - One hour before the nominations were offered on the convention floor it was widely reported that the ticket was to be Governor Wright for President and Governor Thurmond for Vice President . Afterward , Governor Thurmond told reporters , " I came over here to say a few words-and found myself recommended for President . "           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
