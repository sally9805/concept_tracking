A maxim of Hippocrates , in Old English lettering , hangs beside the desk of Dr. Roscoe Roy Spencer in Bethesda , Md. : <P> Life is short , <P> Art is long <P> The occasion instant <P> Experiment perilous <P> Decision difficult . <P> To a man who has made public health his life 's work , experiments perilous are strictly a part of routine . In 1919 " Spenny " Spencer fought bubonic plague in New Orleans ; in 1922 he went to Montana to tackle Rocky Mountain spotted fever , developed a vaccine which won him a gold medal from the American Medical Association , public renown as the hero of Lloyd Douglas ' novel , Green Light . Now he is elbow-deep in another ( and even more important ) experiment : as director of the National Cancer Institute , he heads a staff of 120 seeking the cause-and eventually cure-of cancer . <P> Life &; Death . Suggestive as it is of death ( it is second only to heart troubles as top U.S. killer ) , cancer is in fact life run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pattern . The riddle of the disease will not be solved until the secrets of the rebel cells which ravage human tissue are revealed . Meanwhile , the answer must be sought through research in the basic sciences of chemistry , biology and physics . <P> Over the past eight years , by exhaustive trial &; error , the National Cancer Institute and its associates have identified a few pieces which may some day fit into a complete picture : <P> There is no single cause for cancer . <P> The disease has been produced by ultraviolet rays-indicating that cancer of the skin may be caused by overexposure to the sunlight . <P> The theory that susceptibility to cancer is inherited has been substantiated in experiments on mice . <P> In 5 years ' experimentation with tissue cultures at the Institute , Dr. Wilton R. Earle transformed normal cells to cancerous cells by treatment with 20-methyl-cholanthrene , a coal-tar chemical . In an effort to determine what takes place in the mutant cells , he now plans to destroy existing cultures and re-outfit his laboratory for a fresh attack on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week in Washington hearings opened on the $100,000,000 Neely-Pepper bill , which would marshal " the best cancer brains in the world " for an all-out war on the disease , in the same way that the Manhattan Project conquered the atom . Surgeon General Thomas Parran of the U.S. Public Health . Service told a jampacked opening-day audience that there are not enough properly trained cancer researchers as yet even to begin such a program . Why not , he asked , use the existing facilities and experience of the National Cancer Institute as a nucleus for the research organization ? <P> Not all medical and scientific experts agreed with him . Dr. Howard J. Curtis of Columbia University , one of the foremost researchers on the atom bomb , thought that an entirely new government agency should be created . And when Dr. Parran suggested that about ten years would be required to spend the $100,000,000 , crusty Representative Matthew Mansfield ( " Matt " ) Neely , co-author of the bill , exploded : " We have got to stop piddling around with cancer research . ... I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Harvard College gets the money , if someone will just do what Roosevelt and Churchill did to solve the atomic bomb . "
