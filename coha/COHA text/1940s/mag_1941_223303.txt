In the radio rooms of some 50-odd U.S. merchantmen plying Far Eastern waters last week , a terse , startling message suddenly crackled : Proceed at once to friendly ports . <P> This order was from the U.S. Navy . It meant that each ship-whatever its cargo - had to alter its course . Not since World War I has the Navy issued such an order . But not since then have the calm Pacific waters been as non-pacific as they were last week . Seamen landing at Seattle last week , called them " positively hostile . " <P> Because West Coast maritime comings &; goings are no longer published , a complete log of affected ships is unobtainable . But veteran shippers knew the log included several World War I Hog Islanders , at least four luxurious ocean greyhounds , a few new Maritime Commission C-2 and C-3 cargo boats-some on their maiden voyage . Some specific cases : <P> &gt; Isthmian Steamship Co. ' s Black Eagle was probably halfway from Manila to Honolulu when the Navy 's order came , at once made haste under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tin , other strategic materials , she would be a fat prize in anyone 's war . <P> &gt; The President Taylor ( American President Lines ) , outward bound for a general Far Eastern cargo , probably ducked into Singapore . Sister ship President Madison was near Honolulu ; her senior officers already may be riding Waikiki surfboards . <P> &gt; American Mail Line 's Cape Alava was at Hong Kong , is probably nestled under the fortress ' mighty guns . <P> From Penang , Isthmian 's Ensley City was headed for seething and steaming Dutch East Indies ports . The Puerto Rican , out of Balik Papan , was homeward bound , her crew hopeful of reaching Boston Dec. 2 . <P> Only President Roosevelt and Navy Secretary Knox knew when the " standby " order would be lifted . But many a war-wise shipper guessed it would be soon . Reason : the order detained 10-15 vessels bound for Vladivostok with oil and machinery vitally needed by the Russians . It also held back tons of raw materials needed for U.S. war forges . Other shippers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be escorted ( by the Navy ) to Manila , there equipped with guns . That would take longer-but be safer .
