The Second Battle of Berlin was not Armageddon , but it was the most extreme case to date of face-making and nose-thumbing among the nations . <P> Masses of Spies ? On scant ( 24 hours ) notice the Russians last week bluntly informed the Western Powers that henceforth a new inspection policy would prevail on travel through the Soviet zone which encircles Berlin . Russian officials would board all military trains , inspect passengers and papers , pick over cargoes . <P> On the four-lane concrete Autobahn roughly paralleling the railway , a new control point for all vehicles would be set up at Nowawes , on the outskirts of Berlin . <P> Blandly , at first , the Russians spelled out the ostensible reason for such severities . They were decreed " in the interest of expediting travel . " Then egg-bald Colonel Alexander Tulpanov indicated why the Russians were jittery . He thundered to a German audience : " Spies from the British and American zones come in masses to Berlin and from there into the Soviet zone to carry out economic , political and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by recent public reports that the U.S. was about to beef up its espionage service . Or the Kremlin may have created the Berlin crisis in order to take the news play away from final enactment of the European Recovery Program . In Britain , for instance , two papers got so excited about Berlin that they failed to mention that President Truman had signed ERP . <P> Tit for Tat .

" We just got on a bus , " explained one of the tots casually . <P> A platoon of M.P.s cordoned the Soviet-run German railroad administration building . The official reason : contrary to the four-power rules , the Russians had installed armed sentries there . For 24 hours entry was denied all Russians , even two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russians to carry in food for the guards inside the building . Instead , a U.S. lieutenant colonel inspected Russian soup , bread , coffee and cigarettes , then permitted German policemen to carry in the food . <P> To his chiefs in the U.S. , General Clay had radioed this assurance : " We will sit tight . We will not be provocative . . . . Evacuation to me is unthinkable . " At week 's end several U.S. and British freight trains got through to Berlin without being challenged . And , finally , the Russians grudgingly agreed to meet with the Western Powers to " clarify " their terms , if not alter them . For a time , it appeared , there would be an uneasy truce-until the Russians probed elsewhere . Patience and firmness had paid off again .
