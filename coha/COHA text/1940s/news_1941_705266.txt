txt Jacob ( Jack ) Bernoff , 34 years old , an ex-convict , former partner and stooge for Louis ( Lepke ) Buchalter and Jacob ( Gurrah ) Shapiro in the garment industry racket of a few years ago , and before that of Larry Fay in the old milk industry shakedown racket , was held in $50 , - 000 bail yesterday by Judge Streit in General Sessions as a long-missing grand jury material witness . Only a little while earlier he had been arrested in connection with District Attorney Thomas E. Dewey 's revival of another investigation of racketeering he had started two years ago , involving millions of dollars in shakedowns , with small tradesmen and truckmen in the loose milk industry as the purported victims . Bernoff has several police aliases , with the name Cohen as a base for most of them . He was surprised at Sixth Avenue and Fifty-seventh Street about 2 P. M. yesterday by Lieutenant William Grafenecker and Detectives James Canavan , Bryan Farrell and Joseph Norbury of Mr. Dewey 's office after an intensive night and day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word of his capture came to the District Attorney 's office from Lieutenant Grafenecker it was announced that Bernoff was suspected of being one of the principals in the biggest racket in the history of the country  --  bigger than the Lepke and Charles ( Lucky Luciano ) Lacania rackets that startled the nation a few years ago . Fay Slain by Policeman Later it was charged that when Larry Fay , who on New Year 's Eve , 1933 , was shot and killed by a drink-crazed former policeman in front of a midtown night club , organized the retail milk racket about 1928 Bernoff was his closest lieutenant . Bernoff , whose criminal career began as a truant in Brooklyn twenty-two years ago , had been sentenced in 1924 to Sing Sing for a term of three to six years for carrying a pistol . In 1928 , only a short time after his release from the prison , he was convicted in Brooklyn in the kidnapping of a wealthy bookmaker named Greenfield and sentenced to a fifty-year State prison term . This conviction , however , was reversed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in seeking to have Judge Streit fix the bail at $75,000 , charged that Bernoff , at about the time of his release from serving the long sentence , allied himself with Larry Fay in the creation of the milk racket . The racket has been in existence ever since , with large sums of money being extorted by the leaders from victims , he added , and Bernoff not only had a powerful hand in its operation but also took in as a sideline the management of the garment industry racket , organized years after the Fay venture by Lepke and Gurrah , both of whom now are serving long prison terms . Linked to Garment Racket Mr. Yarrow also told Judge Streit that a revival of the investigation of the milk racket by District Attorney Dewey in 1938 had developed that after Lepke and Gurrah vanished when being sought by Mr. Dewey in the bakery and flour trucking racket , which eventually led to the pair 's downfall , Bernoff moved in as the actual dictator of the garment racket at Lepke 's request . He mentioned the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the milk racket inquiry already had been placed under bail as material witnesses in the new inquiry . These men were Murray Gabaeff , described as another close lieutenant of Fay in the early days of the milk racketeering , and Edward H. ( Lefty ) Taylor . Mr. Dewey charged that at one time they had been partners in Bronx and Harlem dairies at the time of the organization of the racketeering by Fay . Each now is under $20,000 bail . Gabaeff was revealed on his recent arraignment before Judge Streit as one of the sixty co-defendants , including several corporations , named in indictments with Fay in 1929 for milk racketeering , which at that time was credited with having netted the racketeers $800,000 yearly . These defendants were brought to trial in General Sessions in 1931 on charges of coercion with violence , but all were acquitted . When Taylor was arrested as a material witness two weeks ago , he said he had been engaged in the music box business in Philadelphia in recent years , but it was declared at the time that the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is known as the " juke box " business , operated by racketeers . Few Details Are Provided Mr. Dewey did not disclose any details of the racketeering , not even to say whether it was confined to the loose milk business , as had been previously reported . He admitted the capture of Bernoff had been planned for more than two months by Assistant District Attorney Aaron Benenson , Mr. Yarrow and Lieutenant Graefenecker , and expressed elation over what he declared was the most important development up to date in the investigation . Mr. Yarrow revealed before Judge Streit , however , from an affidavit he read to the court , that Bernoff 's testimony was needed before the grand jury as " material andl necessary " in connection with evidence that Mr. Benenson recently had uncovered against several , " prospective defendants " in the ' I racketeering . He also said that Bernoff , on learning in 1938 through some y m sterious channel that Mr. Dewey had started to delve into that racket , had vanished , but even so remained in close touch ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the racket . He added that when Mr. Benenson and the detectives put renewed pressure about two months ago in their bunt for Bernoff , there had been recent startling developments before the grand jurors which made the presence of Bernoff before the body most necessary . He further declared to Judge Streit that Bernoff had been disclosed as having been a principal in regular conferences among the racketeer leaders and others , whom Mr. Yarrow 's auditors assumed to mean victims , all through the twelve years of the racketeering in the milk industry , and insisted that , although he knew that Bernoff could raise $75,000 bail with ease , he was not certain Bernoff would not sacrifice that amount to bail rather than appear before the grand jurors . Prisoner Listens Closely Bernoff , who was neatly dressed in a well-fitting camel 's hair overcoat and gray suit , with a white shirt and cerise necktie , cocked his ear attentively when Mr. Yarrow was outlining the reasons for his high-bail demand , obviously intent on absorbing every morsel of information the prosecutor might be willing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say until Judge Streit asked him whether he desired to oppose such high bail , when he replied : " I 'd like an adjournment , Your Honor ; you see , I have no lawyer with me . " Then he announced he had telephoned for a lawyer and expected him to appear ' at any minute , whereupon Judge Streit consented to set over the proceeding for a few minutes . Morris Kaliski appeared as Bernoff 's lawyer a few minutes Jacob Bernoff , committeed yesterday when he failed to raise $50,000 bail . Times Wide World later and Mr. Yarrow further toldl the court : " I know this witness knows and was a close associate of several prospective defendants in this milk racket investigation . I also know that he easily can get $75,000 bail from various sources . " Mr. Kaliski , after studying the affidavit that had been submitted to the court in the motion to detain Bernoff as a material witness , described $75,000 bail as exorbitant . He added that he was not in a position to , state the amount that could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , in view of Bernoff 's evasion of the Dewey detectives for more than two years and his previous long prison record , he would make the amount $50,000 . Bernoff 's lawyer informed the court that his client was not prepared to furnish that amount at present , and the court signed a commitment to place Bernoff in the House of Detention , although it had been intended by Mr. Yarrow to have him placed in the Tombs ' overnight to separate him from possible contact with the other witnesses in the case . As he was being led out of court , it developed that Bernoff 's arrest on Sixth Avenue was due to an accidental meeting with him by the detectives who had been combing the vicinity , convinced the alleged racketeer chief had been in hiding in some large apartment house thereabout . In the process of tracking down Bernoff , the detectives had trailed more than sixty men and women friends or suspected racketeer associates and they were trailing one of these when Bernoff suddenly appeared . He denied from the start he was Bernoff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admit his identity until the detectives had taken him to the District Attorney 's office .
