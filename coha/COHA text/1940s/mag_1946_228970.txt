Within an hour one day last week the C.I.O. 's United Steelworkers accepted and the U.S. Steel Corp . rejected President Truman 's compromise wage offer in the steel negotiations . The steel strike-the inconceivable strike , the biggest strike in U.S. history-was born . <P> The President had issued what amounted to an ultimatum . He had asked C.I.O. President Phil Murray and U.S. Steel President Ben Fairless to settle for an 18-an-hour wage increase . This was 3 more than Ben Fairless ' final offer of 15 ; 1 less than Phil Murray 's final demand of 19 . <P> Replying , Phil Murray said yes in less than 100 words . Ben Fairless took longer . Said he : <P> " Your proposal is almost equivalent to granting in full the union 's revised demand ... of 19 an hour . In our opinion there is no just basis from any point of view for wage increase of the large size proposed . . . . There is a limit in the extent to which wage demands can be met by us . ... <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we can not overlook the effect both on this corporation and on our customers and American business in general . An 18-an-hour wage increase . . . must result in higher prices for steel than have previously been proposed by the Government . Great financial harm would soon follow for all users of steel . . . . Such a high and unjustified wage scale might well spell financial disaster for many of the smaller steel companies and for a large number of steel fabricators and processors . The nation needs the output of these companies . . . . " <P> Hijacking ? On reading Ben Fairless ' reply , Phil Murray waxed loquacious . He called newsmen to the green-paneled conference room of C.I.O. 's Washington headquarters-where his portrait hangs alongside those of Jefferson and Lincoln-and issued a burning statement : <P> " American industry , fattened with war profits . . . has deliberately set out to destroy labor unions , to provoke strikes and economic chaos , and hijack the American people through uncontrolled profits and inflations . ... Its clear aim is to exact unconditional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . The steel industry now has the full and sole responsibility for the strike which must take place . . . . " . Had Big Steel really been merely stubborn in refusing to compromise for the President 's proposal and thus avert a strike ? One industrialist thought so . Big , bustling Henry Kaiser rushed to the White House with Phil Murray , emerged to announce that he had signed with the Steelworkers at 18 for his plant at Fontana , Calif , ( which employs only 3,000 men and enjoys a favorable price differential of $12 a ton ) . Cried Big Henry : <P> " Three and a half cents is 2% of steel wages . Who can estimate costs down to 2% ? Can anyone hesitate to save this country for 3 ? " <P> Behind the Statement . While Henry Kaiser got his usual bumper crop of headlines , Big Steel-which always moves slowly-remained mum . But there were other reasons to consider , beyond Ben Fairless ' statement that " there is a limit , " for Big Steel 's stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
