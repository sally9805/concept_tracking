THE THREAD A Story RACHEL MACKENZIE H ANDS were the only thing that mattered . The special had the easiest  --  sure and light ; the student nurses sure and heavy ; and Sarah 's loving but uncertain . " Wipe off my face , please , " the thin little voice that spoke with her mind but seemed to come from outside her would say  --  hardly more than a whisper  --  and she could tell who was with her and guess at the time , day or night . Only she forgot right away . " I feel I should tell you " ? Dr. Loring had looked so solemn , with a conscientious frown on her young smooth forehead ? " that it 's a very painful operation . " " I understand , I 've had my appendix out , " she 'd said . " Oh . " Dr. Loring had looked a little unsettled . " I 'm afraid there 's no comparison . We 've made a good deal of progress with them edication , but apparently the pain 's too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do is keep it dulled . To get at the nerve , you see , involves removing several of the ribs each side  --  just the small ones . We do n't even tell most patients , the idea might alarm them , but you 're intelligent ; it wo n't bother you . You know last week we had quite an exciting experience : a few months ago we operated a woman three months pregnant . We were going to abort her , but she 'd been married nine years without a child and she begged so , Dr. James said finally we 'd risk it  --  and my dear , she was delivered last week ! " " Did the baby have all its ribs ? " Ellen hadasked . " I beg your pardon ? " Dr. Loring smiled her thin sweet smile . " Oh , I see what you mean . Yes , yes it did  --  it was a perfectly sound nice baby . " " I think I 'm going to be sick again , " Ellen 's voice said . " Here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enamel pressed under her chin . " There ! Now you should feel easier for a bit . Try sucking this ice ; I 've wrapped it in a paper napkin . " Her left hand was fastened around it , and the hand was moved for her up to her mouth . " My throat 's sore . " " Yes , you 've had a trachea tube . " I 've had a trachea tube . " Just a pinprick . " " My arm hurts . " " Where ? " She fumbled toward her elbow with her right hand . " Oh , that 's from the blood pressure instrument ; we 've been taking your blood pressure . Try not to move that hand : there 's a needle in it . " Her hand was lifted back to her side . " I think I 'm going to be sick . " " Careful of that hand ! " " Wipe off my face please . " " Oh darling ! " Sarah 's hand and the washcloth too wet . Morning ? Night ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I ca n't . " " I 'll lift you . " " But I ca n't . " " I 'm sorry , I have to  --  it 's been nine hours . " One of the student nurses ; her hands were so cold , Who moaned ? Did she moan like that ? " All right ? I 'll turn on the water . Any luck ? " " I ca n't . " " Well , do n't worry about it , you never can after this operation . " " Oh , do n't move me again . " " Now you do n't want to stay on a bedpan all night , do you ? " Was she the one making that noise ? H ERE , try this . " The night supervisor 's voice . " We ca n't make you any sicker , and it might help . At least it 'll give you something to be sick on . " A glass rod , a pill , a taste as flat as soda . " I 'm going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand ! Nurse , take that pillow out from under her knees . " " I was trying to make her a bit more comfortable . " That voice belonged to the little one with dimples and soft hands . " You want her to have an embolism ? " A starched rustle . The pillow came back . " You poor thing . " " I 'm sorry , I 'm going to be sick . " " Just a pinprick . " That 's what the special said . Was it the same morning  --  the next morning ? " Can you hear me , Miss Godfrey ? " Down the hall a baby was crying , and the rattle of dishes in the pantry knocked against her head . " Your right hand 's strapped to a board . There 's a needle in it . You keep moving it and every time you do , it bleeds . " " It 's sore . " " It 's been bleeding . We ca n't take it out until you stop being sick . " " No . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand on her wrist was different from all the others . " Ellen , I 'm so sorry . " " Darling , look what I 've brought you . " " Sarah ? " " Ca n't you open your eyes ? " " I ca n't . " " Please try . Look . " Her soft voice coaxed . " I ca n't . " With a great effort she explained . " If I open my eyes I 'll be sick . " It was all slurred together . " But you have n't had them open for two days . " " I ca n't . " " Then I 'll have to tell you  --  it 's a tiny Venetian glass basket with one blue bachelor button and a sweetheart rosebud . Carbone 's fixed it for me . You 'll love it . " " I ca n't . " " I 'll put it right by your bed . Can you smell it ? " " Just ether . " Sarah 's hand was too heavy on her head . " I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter , darling . " " I think I 'm going to be sick again . " When they rubbed her back she screamed inside , but the only sound in the room was the dry slithery sound of the nurse 's powdered hand on her skin . V OICES hurt . There was a voice whis- pering at the foot of the bed . " Do you know ' where Sarah is ? " It joggled the bed . " We were going to meet and she did n't come . " " Martha ? " The sound could n't have got out of her mind , for the whispering went on . She concentrated on raising the forefinger of her right hand . It was strapped down . " Shh ! " the whisper said . " She 's restless . We 'd better go out into the hall . " " I think I 'm going to be sick again , " her voice said . " Sarah ? " She sounded so far away from herself . " She 's gone ; she said to tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to say goodbye , but you were asleep . " " I never looked at her flower . " " Can you look now ? " " Fin afraid to open my eyes . " " Just a pinprick . " They were using her leg now . " We 're going to try something for your nausea , Miss Godfrey . " That was Dr. Brewer 's voice . " You ca n't go on being sick like this . " " Just another pinprick . " S OMEONE was speaking close to her ear . " Ellen dear . " Why , it was Dr. James ; she 'd never even seen him before she came into the hospital . He put his hand on her forehead . " Ellen dear . " " Yes ? " Her voice was so high  --  thready ; her voice was thready . The ether had been like trailing off into a thread , raveling into a thread , and on the last breath the thread had held for the longest second in the world before it snapped . I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Can you think of anything you could eat ? Anything at all ? Do it to please me . " Her voice came from a long way off . " I might eat a piece of orange . If I could chew it . My mouth 's so dry . " " Get her an orange . " " Fruit , Dr. James ? " " Anything . " " Will it make me sick again ? " " I hope not . " " I ca n't open my eyes . " " No . Do n't try . Are you in much pain ? " . " My back . " " I 'm sorry . " He 's sorry , he 's sorry , he 's sorry . " Here 's your orange ; eat it slowly . " " Where 's my nurse ? " " I 'm your nurse  --  oh , you mean Miss Robinson ? She did n't come on today . With the shortage you can only have specials forty-eight hours . " " What day is it ? " " Thursday  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . " " Thursday ! " " We 've been keeping you asleep . " " Here , I ca n't eat any more . " " But you only ate one section . " " That 's all I can eat . " " All right . Now I want to move you . " " I ca n't move . " " You have to . Come on  --  careful of that hand ; I 'll lift it . Move with me . I 'll put my hands under you . There ! " The sound she made was like the whimpering of that dog a car had hit outside the house last summer . " Wipe off my face , please ; it 's wet . " " I 've come to get you up . " " I ca n't . " " Sure you can  --  you 're already two days behind . I 'll crank you up so you MAGAZINE wo n't have to pull on your back . Do n't you move . I 'll swing your feet out for you . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Just sit there a minute . " The nurse put her finger on her pulse . " I guess that 's all we 'll try today . " " I ca n't breathe . I ca n't get my breath . " " That 's the operation . We 'll put you right back . " " I ca n't get back . " " I 'll swing your feet up just let your-self go now . " " Hand me a washcloth so I can wipe my face off , will you ? " Her voice was funny  --  hoarse . " I 'll do it for you . Say , you are wet . We 'll really get you up tomorrow . " The organ in the chapel three stories down was playing Rock of Ages . I ca n't , she thought , I ca n't do it . " Nurse , what 's the soonest they ever do the second operation ? " " Now what arc you asking a question like that for ? " " I want to know . Please . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days to two weeks . Last spring we had a man from Washington , they did his second after a week and he was out of here in three . Of course he was the husky type . But with you I could n't say , I 'm sure . You 'll have to ask your doctor about that . Even if I knew , I could n't tell you . " " Is the second as bad as the first ? " " Now quit thinking about it  --  here , turn over and I 'll rub your back . " " Is the second as bad as the first ? " " Why it all depends , I guess . You just have to keep remembering the first is n't any good without the second , see ? " Oh God , she thought . I BET you do n't want to see me  --  getting you in for this . " " Hello , Dr. Moore . " Her coat looked as if ' it had been starched twice . " Got your eyes open at last ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 've just been having a talk with the head anaesthetist  --  about your being so sick . You were n't supposed to have been so sick . She said you must have been conditioned against ether some time . They have a wonderful record here : fifty per cent of all their patients in anaesthesia are either not sick at all or only once ; fifty per cent are sick twelve hours or under ; and less than one per cent are ever sick longer . Those are the statistics . " " I do n't believe it ; that 's more than one hundred per cent . " Dr. Moore laughed . " I guess you 're feeling better , all right . Much pain ? " " My back . " " You 're getting an awful lot of dope . You know , I think you make a mistake to keep yourself under such control . You 'd be better off to let yourself go  --  cry , scream if you feel like it . Be much easier on your nervous system . " " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easier on me . " " That 's silly . They tell me you have n't even cried . " " I 'd feel worse about myself for having cried than better for crying . " It sounded silly . " Besides , I 'm afraid if I once started I 'd never be able to stop . " " What of it ? You 'd be better off . Control 's too important to you ; you 're too disciplined . Just remember you ca n't control your nervous system . " Well , you can always try . She did n't say it . " Do you know when they 're going to do the next one ? " " Honestly ! Thinking about that already ! Two weeks probably . They 'll tell you , do n't worry . You must n't have it on your mind ; it is n't good for you . " HEN they stood her on her feet she gasped for air , and the walls and floor fell away ; when she walked it was like going down a forty-five degree ramp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But it 's supposed to come up to meet you , she thought ? " The floor rose to meet her and she knew no more . " Instead , the ceiling came down . She ducked her head to escape the ceiling . " Steady ! Look , you all right ? " " Sure . " The perspiration dripped from her face . " Miss Rudd , would you help me get Miss Godfrey back to bed ? " Every evening Jane came . Poor girl , she was always there during the hours that were worst  --  when the dinner dope gradually wore off and it was n't time to be made comfortable for the night . " We do n't dare give you any more , " they said . " Remember you have another coming up . " The pattern of the days had taken on a shape as ordered as a quilt  --  shaded patches of unbearable lost awakening to slow relief to restlessness to pain and then to sleep again . " You make too much effort , " Dr. Moore said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's awfully hard on your nervous system . Your nervous system 's taking a beating on this as it is , remember . Everybody here knows what you 're going through ; nobody 'd care if you cried . " " Well , rd care , " " Shall I read tonight ? You look tired , ' " , Jane said . " What 've you got ? " " You choose something , " Ellen said . " I 'm not reading anything ; my eyes do n't focus . " " How about Boston Adveneure ? " She read it for a time . " I do n't believe that 's very cheerful . How do you feel . really ? " " I do n't see how I can go through it all again . " She said it out loud , with lane right there by her bed . Without any warning , coming to the surface like that  --  the one thing that was not to be said ! Jane looked at her with horror . " I know , " she murmured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes slowly filled with tears . You could n't possibly , Ellen thought , no one could . " I 'm terribly sorry , " she said quickly , " I do n't know what made me say that . " But it stayed in the room with her -- quite tangible in the ugly tan room . " Miss Godfrey , this is Dr. Herzog and Dr. Bush . We 're coming in to take out those stitches . Dr. Bush is Dr. James ' new surgical assistant ; he 'll be looking in on you from now on . This wo n't hurt . " Dr. Bush and Dr. Brewer had on little blue skull caps ; Dr. Herzog 's was white . " Have you seen silver foil used before ? " Dr. Brewer said , tearing the wide bands of adhesive from her back . They reached from her shoulder clear down around her buttock , and when he pulled them off , her whole back burned . " How many stitches are there , Dr. Brewer ? " " Am I hurting ? " " No , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or so , I guess . I did n't count . " He talked in a lower voice then , to the other doctors , and when the last stitch was snipped out , he came round to stand in front of her . " Do n't worry , it 'll fade out to a thin white line you 'd hardly notice . " He laid his hand on her shoulder . " Dr. Brewer , when are they going to do the other one ? " " For God 's sake ! You 're not worrying about that already ! " His voice was too hearty . That evening Dr. Bush stuck his head in the door . " Had a good day ? " he asked . " More comfortable with all that padding off your back ? " " Yes , except that I do n't feel so held together . " " By the way , " he said , elaborately casual , " has anyone told you you 're up for tomorrow ? " Her heart thudded across her throat . " U , ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week today . " " You 're up for twelve-thirty . " " Oh , I 'm not going to have to wait all morning ! " " Sorry , you 're the first on the schedule ; We are n't operating until afternoon . So long  --  until tomorrow ! " He had hardly come into the room . I ca n't , she thought helplessly , and she knew again the drugged suspense of the ride to the operating room and the horror of the anaesthetic , and the circled wakening from nowhere . I ca n't  --  not so soon . " Is n't it soon ? Is n't it sooner than usual ? " she asked the nurse who came in to shave her back . " Oh well , this way you 'll get out all the sooner ; why do n't you look at it like that ? " My mind is n't ready yet  --  I 'm not ready in my mind . But what she said was , " I had n't thought of that . I suppose it means no breakfast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Want a drink before I take away the water ? " " Then I 'll be sick . I 'll be sick all morning . This codeine makes me sick as a dog  --  even if the tray just comes a little late I 'm sick . " " Yeah , I know , " the student nurse said . " It affects some people like that . " " Not even coffee ? Not just a cup of black coffee ? " " Not even water . I 'm sorry . " " But what possible difference could a cup of coffee make  --  if I 'm going to be sick anyway ? " " Maybe this time you wo n't be sick . " D o N'T let me be sick , only four hours more , do n't let me be sick . " Not a bath  --  not today ! " " Nervous ? " " I do n't want to be jiggled . I 'm afraid I 'm going to be sick . " " It 's too bad you have to wait . Here 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sick , do n't let me be sick  --  only three hours more . " One ring , yellow with three red stones , five white stones ; one watch , yellow , two white stones ; glasses . Have I everything ? You have n't any dentures , have you ? " " No , no dentures " ? do n't let me be sick before she leaves . " Then if you 'll just sign here . " Do n't let me be  --  Oh God , do n't let me " We 've come to get some blood . Say , you need a nurse . I 'll go get you a nurse . We can wait . " " What time is it ? " " Eleven . Do you think it would help if you chewed on a cracker ? " " How soon can we go up ? " " Just another hour . I 'm going to get you a cracker . " " I feel so humiliated . " " You ca n't help it . " " But I 'm going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me wash of your face . I 'm going to get you ready . There 's no sense in this . Eat a cracker . " Do n't let me be sick again , do n't " I 'm sorry , I have to make your post-op bed . It 's crazy , but your special is n't coming on until three . " " I 'm going to be sick again . " " I know those blankets must feel like the devil in this weather . My gosh , it 's hot ! Here , we 'll get you into your leggings ? I 'll do it , lie still . Now the T binder and your surgical johnny . That 's the ticket . All right ? " " Everything 's whirling around so . " If I have to be sick again , let it be here . " Close your eyes . The basin 's beside you . I 'll be back . " I ca n't . " Here 's your hypo  --  this ought to do the trick . Now you just lie perfectly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . . . . There ! Any better ? " " I think so . " Why , what had happened to her voice  --  coming to her from outside like that . And her hand relaxed around the basin . " Hang onto that basin . Morphine makes some people sick . Ready ? We 're off ! " Do n't let me be sick ; dear God , do n't let me be sick in front of anybody else . " Hello , " she said to the elevator man . " Well , I think I 've seen you before , " he said . " She 's going up for her second , " Miss Rudd said . " Well , fancy that ! " Up for her second , up for her second . " Careful ! We have n't been feeling so good this morning . Here we are  --  the James patient reporting , " Miss Rudd said . It was the first time . It was the first time all over again . " We 're going to move you onto a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second . " Did she make that moaning sound ? " I 've already had one side done , " she said slowly . " You be very careful not to move me until I 'm really asleep because I hurt so to move . " Someone giggled . " The thing I 'm really afraid of , though , is that I 'm going to be sick at my stomach . " " Here , let me give you some oxygen , " the anaesthetist said . " Never mind if you are , " Miss Rudd said , " I have the basin , " " Ready for the James patient , ready for the James patient ? " It was like being paged , but without any identity of your own . They were squashing her nose against that rubber thing . " Breathe deeply now , take long deep breaths . " Oh God , take long deep breaths . Oh God . Oh God . It was the first time only she 'd already been through it . There was that thread again , raveling out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinner . Dear God-I T WAS the middle of the night when she wakened . She knew it . This is the middle of the night  --  as certain as that . No confusion in her mind , no other reality to reconcile . Only a sense , fleeting , of great distance left behind , and this surge of relief to have done with suspense . Then it 's over , she thought , it 's all over ; things do come to an end . She was very ill . She knew that too . Because the room seemed full of the rustle of people ? There was something stealthy in the small scratches of sound they were making about her bed . No , not that . The beating of wings in her chest  --  the terrified flutter of wings and the little curved claws clutching sharp , clawing deep , her breath beating with them in frantic feathery catches ? Not that either . The awareness was intellectual . Her mind had become a separate entity , beyond her body , quite disassociated from it , removed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and above and all-embracing . From it she could see herself twice : inside and outside at the same time ; as she felt and as she was . No one realized she was awake . " But I do n't understand it , " a woman was saying indignantly . " Morphine is the specific for shock ; they use it in the Army ! " and though the sound came to her from far away , Ellen knew the voice of the night supervisor . Her mind picked it up : shack . Of course . Blankets and the foot of the bed raised high . But there was no time to wonder , because in that same second she became conscious of the thread . She was hanging onto the thread . Hanging on by a thread , something nagged at her ; when you 're this sick it 's a matter of hanging on by a thread . She considered it . No , I 'm not hung , she decided judiciously ; I 'm not suspended . This is active : I 'm doing the hanging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of comprehension why it was so important to make the distinction . If she chose to , she could let go . Well , she thought , well ! It must be this new level , the thread so real  --  very slender , and her hold upon it very light . She had only to open her hand where it rested vertical and taut across her palm , as a beam of light might lie enclosed , to release it and find peace . Peace from the nausea , from the pain , from the dreadful dislocation of illness and the adjustment to living that must follow  --  peace even from the problems of the future and getting older . So this is what death is like , Ellen said to herself with comfortable detachment  --  just a simple sense of peace ahead . No fear . No emotional intrusion . Not even people . How odd , when affection and understanding had always mattered supremely , that she should in this moment of choice feel quite free of all personal commitment ; and briefly she noted this was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So one dies with the mind , she thought , and part of the thought was the objectivity from which she saw herself relaxed and curious and welcoming . But what of the thread  --  the thread that had spun from her consciousness but was not attached to her mind ? The thread was life itself , and suddenly it came to Ellen that she could not let it go . Like a small but imperative nudge from the past it came : the obligation to act responsibly , instilled in her as a child so deeply that now , in a way she could only accept , it remained the essential . She could not let go of life to escape unpleasantness . The thread was locked fast around the hard bright core of her own integrity . And that was all . " Just a pinprick , " a nurse muttered under her breath  --  so they said it even when they thought you were asleep .. " ? Dr. Brewer 's voice said , " I think this transfusion should be all right now " ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her mind knew a second 's ironic amusement as she acknowledged her decision . How funny , she thought drowsily , clenching her right fist tight , how incredible that it should turn on a matter of ethics ! When she wakened again , it was only to pain .
