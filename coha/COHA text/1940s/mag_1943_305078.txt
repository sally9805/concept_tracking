Two months ago U.S. Chamber of Commerce President Eric Johnston toured England , describing to British businessmen the attitudes and thoughts of U.S. businessmen . He preached that high postwar employment must be built upon the free trading initiative of individuals in a free economy . <P> Last week , Johnston 's traveling companion , William Benton , vice president of the University of Chicago , told the U.S. what British businessmen are thinking . In a lively , anecdotal log in LIFE of the innocents abroad , Benton said his findings were that : 1 ) England has lost faith in individual initiative , has placed its hope in cartels ( monopoly ) ; 2 ) the State is increasingly important in the British economy . <P> On Monopoly . The attitude of many a cartel-minded British bigwig , Benton reported , was epitomized by Lord McGowan , chairman of the potent Imperial Chemical Industries Ltd. , and a director of General Motors , who said naively : " I see no hope for collaboration between British and American business unless the U.S. repeals its Sherman antitrust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <P> Told by Johnston and Benton that there was little chance of that , Lord McGowan predicted that " unrestricted competition " would bring " eventual chaos . " <P> On Risk . Benton and Johnston found that most British businessmen not only welcomed monopoly , but also welcomed Government as a business partner , looking to it to control competition and provide security . They expected the Government to supply cash to prevent bankruptcy of large employers of labor . Benton high lighted this viewpoint with an anecdote : <P> " ' Now , Mr. Johnston , ' one of our British friends argued , ' in your country you know perfectly well that your Government would n't permit General Motors to go bankrupt . ' " <P> " ' In peacetime , ' replied Johnston , ' we certainly would . ' The entire table looked incredulous . Johnston was taken aback . He turned to me for confirmation . On my return from England , sitting next to Jesse Jones at lunch in Washington , I turned to him . ' And why not ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Security . Fact-finding Mr. Benton came up with two reasons for the British liking for cartels : 1 ) England has never had antitrust legislation such as ours , thus can not understand such legislation in the U.S. nor the fear of the American people of concentrated power in private hands ; 2 ) the British view of capital is poles apart from the American . <P> On this second point , Benton reported : " At dinner in Liverpool , Lieut . Colonel Buckley , chairman of the Liverpool Gas Company . . . told me about Sir Sidney Jones , sitting on my right , saying ' Sir Sidney is a partner in a firm with only 50,000 capital yet it now operates over 80 ships . ' His tone was that of a man who scarcely expected to be believed . <P> " ' When was the firm founded ? ' I asked . <P> " ' Only 80 odd years ago , ' Colonel Buckley answered . Fifty thousand pounds ( $250,000 ) 80 years ago . I thought of Eric Johnston 's four companies in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my own start in business in 1929 with $5,000 . . . ; of the Ford empire , built in one man 's lifetime on . . . $28,000 cash investment .
