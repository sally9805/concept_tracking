In Miami and New Orleans , horse-clippers were busy snipping winter coats from thoroughbreds , which were arriving by the trainload . Publicity men in loud jackets and louder shirts were booming next week 's opening of the winter racing season . Cagey Hirsch Jacobs , who has trained the most winners for eleven of the past 13 years , prepared to head south-too late to do his 1946 record any good . He had won a mere 97 races this year . <P> Out at San Mateo 's picturesque Bay Meadows , a sorrel-haired and taciturn young ( 35 ) rival , Willie Molter , had already won 114 . Four of Willie 's horses galloped home out front last week . Many a West Coast horse fan , convinced that betting on Willie is as good a way as any to win , bet on everything he sent to the post . They did it without Willie 's blessing ; like Jacobs , Willie seldom bets on a horse race , and never more than $10 . ( A typical paddock conversation goes like this : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like my horse today ? " Willie : " I like him a little . " Owner : " Good bet to win ? " Willie : " He might . " ) <P> Willie Molter , who never says two words if one will do , learned his lesson the hard way . He comes from Fredericksburg , Tex . ( pop . 3,500 ) , also the home town of Max Hirsch , trainer of Kentucky Derby winner Assault . As a jockey on dusty , jerkwater tracks in Reno , Emeryville and Butte , Willie blew most of his apprentice salary finding out that nobody could tell who was going to win . Says he : " I could n't even pick the winners I was riding myself . " His toughest job is trying to hold down his five owners ( including Movieman Louis B. Mayer , whose second-stringers are Molter-trained ) . Like most owners , the five tend to overestimate their horses . If a horse wins , the owner wants to enter him in a higher class . Willie prefers to enter horses in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cats . Willie 's 30-horse stable at Bay Meadows has a barnyard look about it . He owns two goats , two ducks , one dog , one rooster and ten cats . He says it settles his horses to look out of the door and " see something moving around . " <P> He cuts down traveling expenses by racing only in California . Because it does n't cost any more to hire a good jockey than a bad one ( established fee : $35 for a winning mount , $15 for a loser ) , he usually uses a top one , Johnny Longden . But he believes a good exercise boy is more important than a good jockey , and hires the best grooms he can find , at top wages . The rest is a matter of bookkeeping : Willie pays the feed bills and the help , collects $10 a day for each horse , plus 10% of all purses . He will clear $40,000 this season . <P> Like most trainers who win a lot of races , Willie Molter deals mostly in mediocre horses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Bric a Bac , five-year-old son of War Admiral . With a bona fide stake horse to work with , Willie is now pointing for the $100,000 handicap at Santa Anita .
