For the last six years the nearest thing to super-stupendous on the air has been the Lux Radio Theatre . Its casts have included all varieties of cinema hotshots . Its productions have often been so lavish that they overflowed the stage of CBS 's Music Box Theatre in Hollywood . Even its rehearsals are a Hollywood event , with autograph seekers pounding at the doors . This week , after its usual summer pause , Lux Radio Theatre begins a new season with Myrna Loy and William Powell in the aerial version of Manhattan Melodrama . <P> Consulting wizard of the Radio Theatre is Cecil Blount De Mille . Nominally producer of the show , De Mille nowadays does little more than serve as commentator , leaves actual work of whipping programs together to Director Sanford Howard Barnett . Only when particularly knotty problems occur does De Mille contribute a bit of sage advice . Once , when animal imitators were unable to render the baying of a beagle , De Mille dispatched six of them to Lake Arrowhead , there to study the call of four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who progressed so fast that he was eventually permitted to imitate Mr. Smith , the wire-haired terrier of The Awful Truth . Another imitator discovered by Lux was George Arliss , who supplemented his performance on one show with several fine peacock screeches . <P> In the course of its existence , the Radio Theatre has aired 272 different shows , ranging from Peg O ' My Heart to the Life of Louis Pasteur . As an aerial Pasteur , Paul Muni was so nervous that he could n't face a mike until a messenger was sent to his home for a violin . After sawing quietly away for a few minutes , Muni got a grip on himself , went through his act without a hitch . Another mike-fever victim was pop-eyed Joan Crawford , who was so scared during her first performance that she had to remain seated through it . As part of his job as Lux Radio 's sage , De Mille has to calm such agitated performers . His favorite actors among those who have appeared in the show are Joel McCrea , Fredric March and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Miss Stanwyck insists on going shoeless when she broadcasts . <P> Putting the Lux Radio Theatre on the air is a complicated business . Clearing rights to a script often takes weeks , and signing up stars is an uncertain enterprise . To make sure that cinema studios wo n't interrupt Lux plans by whisking actors away to distant locations , the Radio Theatre has established an elaborate understudy system . Rehearsals begin on Thursday , continue until air time Monday night . Part of the ritual of every rehearsal is a spot of tea , a custom introduced by Hollywood 's British contingent . Seldom on hand until Saturday . De Mille , who receives $2,000 a week for his stint , sits quietly through rehearsals , patiently corrects his script as Barnett suggests . But he blossoms out each Monday night . Stars usually attend Radio Theatre premieres in slacks and sport clothes . De Mille , when not busy on a picture , wears a trim business suit which he dons in his dressing room on reaching the theatre . When he is busy , he goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark riding breeches , pastel green jacket with vest to match and a dark green shirt . He invariably instructs the announcer to apologize to the audience for his workaday appearance , despite the fact that spectators are stunned by the getup.
