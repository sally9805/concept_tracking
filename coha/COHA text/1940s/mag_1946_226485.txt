The more she pondered the fate of her native Tyrol , the more Miss Frankie Miller worried . Finally she sat down and wrote Britain 's Foreign Minister a letter about it . Instead of mailing the letter , she took it to the New York Times , paid $693 to have it printed last week as an ad . Said Frankie Miller to Ernie Bevin : " Humbly I beg your Excellency to have the liberation of South Tyrol brought before the UNO . ... I also challenge the zone occupation of Austria . " <P> By last week hundreds of special pleaders had caught onto the fact that their money was as good as any department store's-and many a newspaper saw itself being turned into a soapbox . The news columns were easily policed , for publicity could still go into the wastebasket . But where should the line be drawn on such editorial advertising ? <P> Some samples of recent " paid editorials " in the Manhattan press : " Please . . . let me make my Zippers , " by " Bewildered Small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; " Let 's stop the atomic war NOW , " by Americans United for World Government ; " Let 's stop feeding inflation , " by the N.A.M. ; " An appeal to the peoples of the world , " by the Rollins College Conference on World Government ; the Zionists ' " Palestine ... or they perish , " the Arabs ' retort , " Arabs want peace " ; a blurb for Birobidjan , Russia's- " Pearl of the Far East " for Jews ; " An open letter to Congress , " by Sponsors of Government Action against Cancer ; " Shall we help the Communists to crucify Christian Spain ? " by the Missouri Knights of Columbus . <P> Pressagent Russell Birdwell got in early with a stop-the-atom-bomb-test editorial for which the Military Order of the Purple Heart bought the space , giving Copywriter Birdwell a mammoth byline . Headline : WHERE ARE WE GOING ? Hapless newspaper and magazine executives only wished they knew .
