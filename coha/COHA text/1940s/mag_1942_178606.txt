&gt;Texas starts Spanish lessons in the third grade , has just issued 75,000 free Spanish textbooks . <P> &gt;Sixty-eight school systems reported to the Bureau of Education last week that enrollment in Spanish classes had doubled since September . <P> &gt; In colleges , enrollment in French classes has dropped 23.5% , German 11% . <P> &gt;Berlitz Schools ( languages ) have had a 60% enrollment increase in Spanish . French , which was 50% of Berlitz pre-war business , is now only 5% . <P> &gt;Forty-eight U.S. colleges and universities now have courses in Portuguese . <P> The demand for Portuguese caught teachers napping . The American Council of Learned Societies last week announced a special teachers ' training course ( seven weeks ' intensive study ) at the University of Vermont . <P> Vermont 's course will be based on a teaching method developed by Dr. William Berrien of the Rockefeller Foundation . Without overemphasizing vocabulary or ignoring grammar , Dr. Berrien lets his students live the language , urges them to relate it to their special interests : science , anthropology , economics , etc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them most , guides them to the best literature in their particular fields of interest . <P> Dr. Berrien doubts whether U.S. colleges and universities will ever accept this intensive method of teaching foreign languages , but he thinks they ought to . Says he : " If we are now lacking engineers , agronomists and economists with a knowledge of Spanish or French , it is not altogether the fault of the U.S. people who ca n't learn languages ' but also partly of educators who have failed to relate language to the activities and interests of men in different fields of work . The materials used heretofore in language teaching have been too exclusively limited to fiction , a good portion of it decidedly second-rate . " <P> Other signs of the boom in foreign languages : <P> &gt;Courses in Russian at Cornell and Harvard , Moroccan Arabic at Pennsylvania . <P> &gt; Siamese will be studied at the University of Michigan , which already has 14 students in a course in Malay . <P> &gt; The Council of Learned Societies is hunting for native speakers of Swahili , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , can be started at University of North Carolina . <P> &gt;Japanese has had a 1000% increase since December . Only a handful of universities ( Harvard , Columbia , Michigan , Washington , California , Yale , George Washington , a few others ) with " qualified teachers " now teach Japanese . All are working at capacity at a stubborn language which requires a year and a half 's study before a bright pupil can read a Japanese newspaper .
