The U.S. Congress was going to have a look at the world it had worried about for the last seven months . Last week , the State Department cranked out passports in wholesale lots , sent couriers flying around to embassies for visas , wired overseas for hotel reservations . The Army checked its C-54s , alerted overseas commanders to stand by for V.I.P.s . <P> Not all the congressional junkets were headed for overseas . One committee was headed for Hollywood to investigate labor racketeering . House and Senate committees were planning to tour the U.S. , checking up on housing , agriculture , high prices . But at least half-a-dozen separate committees and subcommittees were heading for Europe , three for Alaska , three for the Pacific , one to Latin America . Before they all return to Washington next January , 100 or more Senators and Congressmen in dozens of committees and subcommittees will spend upwards of $2 million crisscrossing the U.S. and circling the globe . <P> Some of the trips looked like just a good time at the taxpayers ' expense . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Massachusetts ' Representative Christian Herter , who has made himself an expert on foreign relief problems , 19 Congressmen picked from 15 regular House committees will sail for a firsthand look at foreign needs and potentialities under the Marshall plan . <P> Careful , conscientious Christian Herter discouraged committeemen from taking their wives , told them to pack no dinner clothes , be prepared on their return to answer a stiff and lengthy questionnaire . Herter 's goal , enthusiastically seconded by Secretary of State George Marshall : to break down old prejudices and educate key personnel of the House . <P> Congressmen were not the only ones who felt the need for travel and information . In Des Moines last week , 17 Iowa farmers rounded up by the American Farm Bureau Federation plunked down $1,500 apiece for a four weeks ' flying trip to Great Britain and the continent . Said 58-year-old Otis Tuttle of Norway , Iowa : " I am satisfied it will be worth the chips . It might wake us up to the fact that America has a responsibility over there . If Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be just too bad for America . "
