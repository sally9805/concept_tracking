txt Hit directly by rising gasoline , parking , and insurance costs and sideswiped by a potential shortage of the winter . These latest curbs to what was to have been the postwar return of unrestricted driving come immediately after the State 's semiannual safety inspection drive that put several hundred Massachusetts automobiles off the road due to faulty equipment . Many motorists also refused to pay the heavy repair bills to put their cars in shape , preferring to garage their automobiles for the winter . Parking Lot Fees Soar Last week , it was a heavy rise in compulsory automobile insurahce rates that gave the average motorist that " fenced in " feeling of a wartime A card car driver . During the war , he had the car and the money , but not the gasoline . Now he has the car , but doubts his ability to finance the mileage . To add to his troubles , parking lot operators announced their intention of increasing their fees from the customary 25 to 35 cents a day to 40 , 50 and 60 cents . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet the parking lots , up to now , have shown no indications of falling off in business while motorists ponder over the prospects of a Jan. 1 withdrawal from the highways . Furthermore , legislators are taking sidelong glances at the gasoline tax . More funds for a much-needed highway construction program may mean higher gasoline taxes in 1947 . Gas Price Boosted In Boston , particularly , the heavy hand of rising automobile costs is pushing motorists off the roads . Those who can not buy new cars at $1,500 to $2,000 each are finding that they can not longer afford to pay fixed charges of approximately $400 a year to keep a $400 car on the road . And the prospects are definitely for higher and higher operating , maintenance , and depreciation costs through the next year , the motorists are told by government officials and car repair men . Where as before the war $50 would take care of most of the annual repairs , they sometimes require more than $200 now . Gasoline prices announced today attained the high peak of 21.1 cents a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regular . This means a half-cent increase in driving costs , on the average , for every 14 to 18 miles . And what does it cost to replace those worn-out tires ? From $17 to $22 a tire , minus the tube , is the average . That means from $68 to $88 for four tires compared with about $40 before the war . For a Boston motorist to keep his car on the road during the next calendar year , the costs average something like this : For compulsory insurance , $50 ; property damage , $15 to $20 ; fire and theft , $4 to $8 ; collision insurance , $15 to $20 ; gasoline including taxes , $160 ; registration , $4.50 ; driver 's license , $2 ; oil , $25 ; repairs and parts , up to $200 ; parking fees , $20 ; excise tax , $3 to $8 ; depreciation , $100 ; garaging , $180 to $240 . Extras Pile Up , Too . Those figures add up to a bare minimum of between $778 and $857 for Boston motorists who intend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average mileage is 12,000 . Those who go farther will pay more . And there are always such incidentals as a minimum of $1 for semiannual , compulsory inspections , towing in winter , antifreeze liquids , battery chargings , and what have you . Adding to the motorist 's dilemma is the battery shortage . Not knowing when or where he can get another battery , the car owner intends to spend plenty to keep the old one in action . Many motorists are contemplating a complete rebuilding of their batteries . Others are shopping around for available batteries to hold them in reserve in case the old one gives out . The Boston Automobile Club indicated that many motor vehicles in Greater Boston alone will go out of use the first spell of cold weather , due to replacement shortages . Cold Comfort And so it goes into the high-cost stratospheres for all tr L.torists . Those who get caug/ .. , parking in front of hydrants or on the wrong side of the streets win pay more in fines . Which brought the retort from Boston traffic authorities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - motorists are those that should be raised more than any others " ? meaning the parking fines . Thus motorists who are forced off the road by the battery shortage will have some consolation .
