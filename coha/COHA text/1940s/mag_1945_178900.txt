( See Cover ) In peace , the U.S. railways , like the human circulatory system , are taken for granted . Only in war , when the crowded arteries pump hard , does the U.S. become conscious of their existence . Last week , the American people were conscious , as seldom before , of their rail system . The congestion , slowly worsening during four years of war , had reached the danger point under the heavy strain of troops deploying from Europe to the Pacific . <P> It had come much sooner than expected . <P> According to the Army plan , the great mass of troops would reach the U.S. in November , when the railroads must find room for 1,500,000 troops . The Army was caught up in its own efficiency ; it was returning troops from Europe to the U.S. some 30% faster than it had expected . In Manhattan , the great grey Queen Elizabeth , the Aquitania and other transports docked last week . In two days , they disgorged 39,695 G.I.s , the biggest disembarkation of the war . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Pullmans , and rumbled off to camp , many a battle-weary veteran bitterly resented the way he was forced to travel . <P> Many sweltered in grimy day coaches , slept on the dirty floors , jeered at the sleek streamliners which whizzed past as they waited for hours on sidings . <P> The Tool . But many a civilian was no better off . They too waited in long lines in railroad stations , were jampacked into coaches , slept where they could find room to curl up . There was this difference , however : for the G.I.s , things would probably get better . ( The Army was already experimenting with a plan to have them sleep in eight-hour shifts in Pullmans , thus triple the number of berths . ) But for civilians things could only get worse . <P> Last week , the Office of Defense Transportation made it plain how much worse they might get . It ordered U.S. railroads to pool all their passenger and baggage cars , so that they will be on tap to meet Army demands . This was partly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was also a plain warning that , from now on , civilians will travel only at the pleasure of the Army . <P> The Job . The railroads had already performed a transportation miracle . By working men &; equipment to the cracking point , U.S. railroads last year hauled 740 billion ton-miles of freight , more than twice the 1939 total . Passenger-miles trebled in the five years to 96 billion . The railroads had no choice . Part of this back-breaking traffic had been the 3,500,000 troops-and all the materil needed to fight in Europe-that were shipped from East Coast ports . The railroads had done the improbable ; now they must do the impossible . Miracle must now be piled on miracle . In the next ten months they must move as many troops across the U.S. as they had done in three years . <P> <P> And this time they could not spread the job evenly over a network of eastern roads . The enormous load had to be carried by the seven thin western lines which finger out from the midwest , snake through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the high sierra to the key ports of the West Coast , Los Angeles , San Francisco , Seattle and Portland .
