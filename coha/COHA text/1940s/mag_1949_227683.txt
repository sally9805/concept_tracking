THE BEST OF INTENTIONS ( 314 pp. ) - Robert Molloy-Llpplncott ( $3 ) . <P> Joe Moreton , 42 , earns $80 a week editing the house organ of a big company , reads good books , listens to good music on the radio , and has lately begun to think aloud . His wife Peggy , 41 , is a trim little Irish woman whose scruples about birth control have lately begun to complicate their marriage . His children , a daughter 18 and a son 16 , are a smart , self-possessed pair of youngsters who answer respectfully when he speaks to them , make moderated replies to his bitter wisecracks , and seem to him to have recently become large , mature and strange . <P> The Best of Intentions begins as Joe is planning a love affair with a girl he met at the opera . The problem is : how to get out of the house on Sunday without the whole family finding it out . <P> Who Kicked Butch ? With these fairly familiar ingredients , Robert Molloy ( Pride 's Way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be to a Manhattan boyhood what A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is to girlhood on the other side of the East River . All the embarrassments and humiliations of adolescence are here , with perhaps a few more than is customary : the pimples , the first long pants , the first dates , the first fights , the first sexual experiences , and the earnest attempts , quickly thwarted , to become a football star . <P> Joe had a pretty hard boyhood . He wet his pants on his first day at school , and after his First Communion was sick as soon as he got back to his pew . When the little girl around the corner told him that Butch O'Hara had tried to kiss her , Joe said , " Somebody 's gon na teach that big dope a lesson . " She told Butch . The next time Joe saw Butch , Butch began to beat him up . But something strange happened : another boy got mixed up in the fight and the next Joe heard about it , Butch was in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joe had laid out Butch , and momentarily he became a hero . <P> Whose Lead Quarter ? The Best of Intentions is Joe 's confession , not of his sins , but of his frustrations-the fights he backed out of , the infidelities unconsummated , the arguments with the salesman who tried to sell him a suit he did n't want and with the cafeteria cashier who refused to take back a lead quarter . <P> The crowning blow to Joe 's self-esteem was that the girl he loved in his boyhood became a popular novelist and wrote a book in which he found himself pictured as a tough guy , with quaint phrases and vague literary aspirations . It was true enough to make him wince and wrong enough to make him sore . Readers may feel somewhat the same way about The Best of Intentions . Its artificiality lies in the vagueness and unreality of Joe Moreton apart from , his adolescent and middle-aged embarrassments . The latter may have been real enough , but they are less than the whole of life , even in Manhattan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
