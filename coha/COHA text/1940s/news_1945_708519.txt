txt HAVING visited the memorial exhibitions of work by Mondrian and Kandinsky , exponents of nonobjective art , I can now understand , in our day of the pill , plasma and penicillin , why so much space is being allotted to their creations . Of course there were other reasons for hailing this work as the " art of tomorrow , " which came out of the mouths of ebullient and erudite gallery enthusiasts who sprinkled their intellectual elucidations with Platonic , Socratic , Pythagorean and Euclidian references . Coming simultaneously with the crossing of the Rhine , and knowing that art is one of the important props of civilization , it occurred to me , according to the adulations of this gallery talk , that here , in this art , is the panacea for future living . Indeed , may not this art be what we are fighting for ? Inspired by all this , I thought I must dash to the Metropolitan Museum and shout through its historic halls : " Down with those antiquated peepertrators of worldly ills , Rembrandt , Rubens , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls with the cube , the circle and the cone ! " From this transformation we can look ahead to the delightful esthetic experience of viewing just a simple , vague line , and at still some future date perhaps exult at the sight of a solitary dot . But not until we reach the Nirvana of all art , just an empty canvas unblemished by any mark , will we know the meaning of civilization . I NOTE in the catalogue of the Kandinsky memorial exhibition now at the Museum of NonObjective Painting , an omission that if allowed to remain uncorrected would constitute a serious distortion of fact . On page 99 there is a professedly complete list of Kandinsky exhibitions held throughout the world . According to this list , Kandinsky never exhibited his paintings in England . However , I gave Kandinsky a one-man show at my London gallery , Guggenheim Jeune , in February , 1938 . Kandinsky regarded this show as a very important one because until that time he had been known in England only through Sir Michael Sadler 's collection . The show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1909 to 1937 . The paintings included were chosen by Kandinsky himself from his own collection , comprising those pictures he had retained because of their quality . The show was personally planned and arranged by Kandinsky . It proved very successful and received wide publicity . After the close of the London exhibition , part of the material , with Kandinsky 's permission , was sent to a public school in the north of England . As a most interested reader of your paper and one who looks forward particularly to the Sunday art criticisms , I am writing this brief line of protest . Sculpture is one of the truly important arts and the Attorney General and I have long been devoted to sculpture in many countries , and in particular to contemporary American work . It was quite a shock to read Edward Alden Jewell 's rather flip dismissal of the sculpture at the exhibition of the National Academy . Of course every exhibition may not contain masterpieces , but it does seem to us rather provincial to ignore one type of art because you are more interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NEW YORK TIMES ? Might that not be a good post-war plan .
