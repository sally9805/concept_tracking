For the better part of a century , London has been the world 's diamond capital . There the British-dominated diamond cartel has held the famed " sights " at which it sells its uncut stones . Last year Britain re-exported 35 million ( $98 million ) worth of diamonds , more than half of them to the U.S. But due to currency controls , the diamond merchants had to resort to sharp practices to stay in business . <P> Many London merchants sold their gems not at the pegged pound rate , but for cheaper pounds in the free money market in Tangier , thereby losing Britain many dollars . But the dealers had little choice . If they had sold their gems at the official rate , Dutch and Belgian dealers would have undersold them . <P> Last week the London-Tangier diamond trade , which had enabled U.S. dealers to get gems for one-sixth under their London price , received a mortal blow . In London 's Clerkenwell Court , I. Hennig &; Co. , Ltd. , one of Britain 's most respected diamond merchants , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The prosecution charged that I. Hennig shipped 76,254 ( $213,511 ) worth of rough diamonds to Tangier and attached false invoices to make it appear that the gems were consigned to a Tangier merchant . Actually , the gems were bought by U.S. merchants , among them Manhattan 's Harry Winston , Inc . ( TIME , April 18 ) and A. G. Parser , Inc . <P> I. Hennig was fined 281,175 ( $787,290 ) , one of the largest fines ever handed out in a London court ; two company officers were sent to jail . When Winston and Parser appeared in court to claim their part of the shipment of diamonds , worth 26,134 , they were cleared of any blame , but the gems were confiscated .
