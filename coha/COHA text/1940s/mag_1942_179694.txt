Starchy Alfred Robinson glancy , former vice president of General Motors Corp. , long bemoaned Franklin Roosevelt and his New Deal Government . Last week Glancy had a new and important job-under Franklin Roosevelt-running the automotive combat division of Army Ordnance in Detroit . <P> Scheduled to become a brigadier general Glancy will direct the " design , procurement , supply and maintenance of all Army vehicles and tanks . " His first act on hitting Detroit was to take over the second highest building in town for a prospective staff of more than 2,500 , for he has a terrific job ahead of him . <P> For a bitterly long time the Army has lost skirmishes in the spare parts and maintenance war . In the same war Field Marshal Rommel has often won victories in the desert by patching up busted tanks and planes , while the British , brave fighters but indifferent to machinery , won defeats . Under the tents that serve as machine shops in the desert the U.S. means to win victories , but first it has a big job to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in transit due to faulty packing , lost through inefficient storage , or has sat useless for lack of simple parts like spark plugs or coils . Where parts have been ordered they have often served no good end : there is no sense ordering as many spare truck cabs as spare fan belts-one seldom requires replacement , the other frequently does . <P> To solve this stuttering maintenance the Army needed an Army man with industry know-how . Glancy 's knockabout experience had included engineering in Cuba , managing an iron foundry , a tractor and auto company , and generally trouble shooting for General Motors . <P> When glancy returned to Detroit , he found the auto industry already teaching Army men to maintain the tanks and other weapons they produce . He found G.M. going farther : sending factory engineer observers to fronts overseas . These observers have the job of reporting why equipment fails in service , when &; why the service is inadequate-putting war-materiel servicing on the same efficient basis that automobile servicing has long been in the U.S. <P> Observers will soon wear special uniforms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can get around and wo n't be shot if captured . G.M. would not let the Army make officer specialists of its men because giving its men commissions would enmesh them in military red tape . <P> Approved last week by the Senate Military Affairs Committee was a bill speeding up the period of officer training at West Point from four years to three . First effect : to give 450 first classmen commissions in January instead of next June .
