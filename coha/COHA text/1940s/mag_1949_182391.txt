Wearing his famed black beret and crackling with splintery opinions , Field Marshal Viscount Montgomery of Alamein popped into Washington last week . Though his visit was unofficial , Monty , as military chief of Europe 's Western Union forces , delivered one deliberate message to the <P> U.S. Chiefs of Staff : if Western Europe was to stave off invasion , the Western Germans must be rearmed for defensive warfare , under Allied command+ <P> This week Monty was to address the English-Speaking Union in Manhattan , publicly and in more general terms . But the nub of his message was the same : that the West could not allow old rancors to divide it against the greater threat of the East . " Civilization is in danger , " he said , " because of a clash between two conflicting moral codes : between Communism and Democracy . . . As a Christian soldier I declare myself an enemy of Communism and all that it stands for . Unless this danger can be held , great trouble lies ahead . . . <P> <P> " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world is going through one of its vast secular revolutions ... a switchover in human affairs such as the world has not seen since Roman days . . . It is the duty of the Western democracies to ensure that this crisis . . . does not lead to the destruction of the civilization , the culture , and the standard of living which is our heritage . " <P> In that struggle , cooperation between the U.S. and Britain is " the linchpin of the structure , " said Monty . " None of us can stand alone and none are doing so today ... In Western Europe , the eyes and thoughts of everyone are ever turning westward . . . They look to the English-speaking nations and wonder if they can count on their help : definitely . We must not let them have any doubts . " <P> Speaking as a soldier , Montgomery warned : " To promise to rescue the West in due course after a successful invasion from the East is quite useless . If the West is overrun again , that is ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let us fail to do the right things now ! " <P> Such common purpose among Western democracies was far more important than technological advantage or more atomic bombs , Monty insisted , and it might mean " some small loss of sovereignty for the common purpose . " But , said Montgomery earnestly , " the premium is not very great . The dividend will be enormous-it will be peace and freedom . " <P> <P> + A position shared by many U.S. strategists , but not by U.S. military policy makers ( see FOREIGN NEWS ) .
