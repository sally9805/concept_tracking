In spare moments between the hottest fighting on Guadalcanal , about 40 U.S. servicemen swatted mosquitoes , sweated over correspondence-school lessons . When they had done their homework , they mailed it to the University of Hawaii , a branch of Usafi ( U.S. Armed Forces Institute ) . Last week the number of fighting men taking correspondence courses from Usafi was not far from 30,000 , more than half of them overseas . <P> Some students on the rolls last week : <P> &gt; Sergeant Albert Joseph Erickson of Chicago , on duty with a South Pacific mobile reconnaissance squadron . His third test paper on the duties of a railroad rate clerk was held up : " A little of the real McCoy popping over here . " <P> &gt; Corporal Luther Leroy Roberts of Virginia , fuse-setter with an overseas anti-aircraft battery , after taking a premedical course at Washington , D.C. 's Howard ( predominantly Negro ) University . He was late with his trigonometry test papers ; some " have been destroyed by tropical insects . " <P> &gt; Lou Ella Thomas of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up on English grammar in Atlanta , where she has a Navy clerical job . &gt; Seaman First-Class Marvin R. Eienbass of Michigan , studying on the high seas to be an automobile mechanic . In six lessons he has had no grade lower than 88 . <P> Usafi , the alma mater of these students , is at Madison , Wis . Supervising from Washington 's Pentagon Building is Harvard 's onetime Education School Dean Francis Trow Spaulding , now a colonel in the Army 's Special Service Division . <P> Usafi offers 64 courses to men of all services at $2 each . Courses include English and social studies , mathematics and sciences , business , mechanical , electrical and engineering trades . In addition , Usafi splits with servicemen the higher cost of any of 700 correspondence courses given by 80 U.S. universities . Example : for about $10 a serviceman may delve into the history of pre-Civil War Dixie , Canada , Russia or ancient Israel . Successful Usafi students get certificates , and many colleges will give them credits . <P> Sturdy at 70 . Ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old . The pioneer in 1873 was Boston 's Society to Encourage Studies at Home . The oldest existing institutions were founded in the early 1890s : the International Correspondence Schools and the University of Chicago 's Home-Study Department . Today the draft has decimated the younger enrollment . But vocational subjects have gained in appeal and many older people are retooling by mail . Estimated total enrollment : 900,000 , of which university extension courses account for 150,000 . <P> The Hays office of the correspondence-school industry is the National Home Study Council set up after a Carnegie Corporation survey in 1926 . Director is the man who made the survey , John Samuel Noffsinger . The Council standardizes practices , investigates frauds , cooperates with the Federal Trade Commission ( correspondence teaching is interstate commerce ) , improves teaching methods . Since the Council started , about 17 diploma mills have been shut down , as many as 13 fraudulent schoolmasters have been in jail at one time , and the fantastic profits of phony schools have largely been squeezed out .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
