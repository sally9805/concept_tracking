A group of foreign correspondents with Nazi cicerones last week completed a 2,500-mile tour of occupied Ukraine . Their findings : <P> No More Resistance . " The territory we went through was militarily under control , beyond any doubt . Strongly garrisoned and kept orderly , it was ready for the next phase , which is administration and exploitation . " <P> But the Russians had done a pretty good job of sabotage : " It will be a year at least before the Ukraine can be got into industrial working order again . " <P> Man Power . " If any advanced country had thousands of able-bodied farmers and skilled factory hands to send into the Ukraine , it would be a marvelous investment for a conqueror . As things stand now , tens of thousands of men have been taken away by the Russians . " <P> Farm Land . " Nowhere did we see any signs of burned crops , such as might be expected under the Soviet scorched-earth policy , although almost all tools , tractors and livestock had been removed or destroyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had brought Sonderfhrer ( special leaders ) from German farms . These little Fuhrers , used to tending small German farms , were dismayed to find themselves put in charge of almost 100,000 acres each . <P> They found a good sugar-beet crop waiting for them , but all the sugar factories wrecked . They set women to harvesting standing wheat and rye , but they had to harvest with scythes and horses instead of modern machinery . They tried to get autumn sowing done , but only put in from 5% to 7% of normal seedings . <P> Kiev . Said a German officer : " We hesitated to turn on electricity for fear of throwing switches that would set off mines , so electrical service was restored gradually , one block at a time . Some were fixed to explode when electricity was turned on ; others when radio transmission started . <P> Seven thousand of the mines we removed were planted in the most unexpected places , where they had no right to be-in museums , cloisters , churches and administrative buildings . . . . The other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emplacements and other points . which the Russians expected Germans to occupy . . . . The Russian forces had taken the fire department with them , including personnel , trucks and hose . " <P> Nilcolayev , a center of shipbuilding , had scarcely an intact factory . A partly completed 35,000-ton battleship had been blown up . A cruiser , one-third armor-plated , lay toppled off its ways , which had been burned under it . Two unfinished submarines had also been destroyed . <P> Odessa has miles-long catacombs , dug in the 19th Century to get sandstone for the city 's construction . From these caves Russian suicide squads were still reported operating . They were said to come out at night , creep from house to house , find enemy rendezvous , blow them up . Fortnight ago the Rumanian general in charge of the city was blown up with his staff . The Rumanians vainly tried to fumigate the catacombs , have now posted machine guns at the vaults ' entrances . Wrote one correspondent : " The whole atmosphere is one of lurking danger and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visits to the battle front during the last two years . "
