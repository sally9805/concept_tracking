txt An effort will be made within the next few days to - ush through Congress a special tax amortization plan foi national defense plants without waiting for action on excess profits tax legislation . Whether this effort will obtain the blessing of President Roosevelt and all aepartments and agencies concerned still is not clear . A meeting of officials of the War , Navy and Treasury Departments will be held today to consider this problem . Officials of the War and Na  --  y Departments , alarmed by delay in the awarding of aircraft contracts and claiming that the amortization problem is the cause of this delay , are understood to have taken the initiative in the drive to divorce the amortization plan from the excess profits tax bill . Treasury 's Views This move is not new , similar action having been taken two weeks ago , when President Roosevelt held the first White House conference on the amortization problem . At that time the Treasury blocked separate treatment of the amortization question , and it still adheres to its position that excess profits ta3ces , special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ship builders should all be part of one bill . In fact such a bill has already been written . Should the excess profits tax become mired down in lengthy debate , some Treasury officials would be willing to reconsider the question of divorcing the amortization section of the bill , but in the meantime they are standing by the White House agreement . Advocates of more speedy action , who claim that they have the backing of the National Defense Advisory Commission , are urging that a joint resolution be introduced in Congress within the next few days embodying special amortization allowances over a five-year period for new plants constructed for national defense work . Such a step may be taken by some member of Congress even though today 's meeting of War . Navy and Treasury officials reaches no agreement on speedy treatment of the amortization problem . Amortization Program Officials of all departments involved and Congressional tax committee members agreed some weeks ago that a request would be made to Congress to permit defense industries to deduct the cost of new war plants from their tax returns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of obsolescence based upon the physical life of the plant . No details of the proposed plan have been made public , but it is known that members of the National Defense Advisory , Commission are in favor of permitting a manufacturer to write off whatever percentage of the cost of the plant he wishes during any given year . In other words , he would not have to deduct 20% of the cost in each of the five years but could , for example , write off 10% in one year . 30% the next year and so forth . The particular impetus for the move to separate the amortization scheme from the excess profits legislation is that contracts for approximately 4.000 airplanes have been gathering dust in desk arawers at the War Department for the past three or four weeks . These contracts call for delivery during 1942 . To meet those delivery schedules the aircraft industry would have to build new plants . But the industry does not feel it can build new plants , or make accurate cost estimates for that matter , until it knows where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question , up until now . has been tied to the excess profits tax question , which probably will not become law until some time in September . Mounting anxiety in national defense circles over this delay was reported on Tuesday , at which time it first became evident that certain officials were determined that " something be done " Would Settle Amortization An alternative " something " would be to use about $100,000,000 available to the War Department for the construction of new aircraft plants to be built and operated by private industry but owned by the Government Officials apparently were reluctant to follow this course and have decided on the effort to get the amortization issue settled by Congress without waiting for a new tax bill . If this move should be blocked by the Treasury or someone else , it is believed that a further effort will be made to award the contracts immediately , if for no other reason than to eliminate the possibility of criticism of the air corps . Furthermore , it is reported that President Roosevelt has taken a direct interest in the aircraft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of air corps procurement .
