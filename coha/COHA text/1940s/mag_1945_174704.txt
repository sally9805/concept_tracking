Torgau is a small German town ( peacetime population 14,000 ) but it-had its place in history long before last week . It was the scene of Frederick the Great 's victory over Austria in 1760 , and a junction point for Austrian and Russian armies massing against Frederick the following year . Last week history repeated itself at Torgau . <P> In the early days of last week Torgau was almost deserted . Marshal Konev 's artillery had battered it from across the Elbe . Only a few Germans , too numb to care what happened , searched rubbish piles for scraps of food and hunted cigaret butts among the cobblestones . The rest had joined a panicky throng swarming westward toward the U.S. lines . <P> Two infantry and one armored divisions of the U.S. First Army had pulled up along the narrow Mulde River , a western tributary of the Elbe . One morning a patrol from the 69th Division 's 273rd Regiment , sent out to direct surrendering German soldiers and liberated Allied prisoners to the rear , rolled beyond its officially prescribed radius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consisted of four Yanks in a jeep-Second Lieutenant William D. Robertson , a small , wiry officer from Los Angeles , and three enlisted men . <P> Mercurochrome &; Ink . The Russians on the other side of the Elbe- members of Marshal Konev 's 58th Guards Division-sent up colored flares , the prearranged signal to designate friendly forces . Robertson had no flares . He took a bedsheet from a house , broke into a pharmacy , found mercurochrome and blue ink , made a crude representation of a U.S. flag and waved it from the tower of an ancient castle . The Russians , who had been tricked by Germans waving U.S. flags , sent over a few anti-tank shells . <P> Then Robertson decided on bold action . He and his men strode confidently out in the open , toward a German-blown bridge whose twisted girders offered a precarious footway across the river . The Russians decided that only Americans would do such a thing . While Robertson 's party picked its way over the girders , two Russian officers scrambled out from the eastern end . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water , the men of Eisenhower and the men of Stalin met . Robertson slapped a Russian leg and cried : " Hello , Tovarish ! Put it there ! " <P> Feasting &; Toasting . The Russians took the four Yanks into their camp on the east bank , where they were beamed at , saluted , backslapped , plied with wine and German schnapps , sumptuously fed . Robertson arranged with the commander to send a delegation across the river to meet U.S. higher-ups . Colonel Charles M. Adams , commanding the 273rd , greeted the delegation at his regimental headquarters , then started out for the Russian camp at two o'clock in the morning , with a platoon in ten jeeps . When they arrived at six , there was more grinning , saluting , backslapping , feasting and toasting .
