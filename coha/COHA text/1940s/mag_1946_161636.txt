Housing Administrator Wilson Watkins Wyatt , a great hand for optimistic statistics , found some more of them last week . He reported that in August more than 100,000 " dwelling units " had been begun and 62,800 finished . Thus , he added , 708,000 had been started in the year and 350,000 had been completed . Said Expediter Wyatt : " The housing the country needs is definitely on the way . " <P> There was no doubt that the building of houses , apartments , barracks , etc. had come along with fair speed , despite the months of confusion over prices , black markets and materials shortages . But it had not come nearly far enough , or quickly enough . <P> Hundreds of thousands of veterans waiting out the emergency in plumbingless shacks or dark basements could see little real progress . Hundreds of builders and real estate people were not as sure as Wilson Wyatt that something more than a fair start had been made . <P> In Seattle many a family was living in a garage back of an uncompleted house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over his story-and-a-half deluxe doghouse into a three-room apartment for student-veterans ( it had a bathtub , designed for dog-dipping ) . In Montana , Idaho and Wyoming families prepared to live out the winter in basement excavations , with roofing paper overhead . <P> Progress ? Last week TIME correspondents in every major U.S. area reported on housing . Sample reports : <P> &gt;Atlanta : 4,000 new houses completed , 4,000 to be completed " fairly soon . " But lack of pipe , furnaces and gas &; electric meters will delay actual completion of hundreds . No real progress made in getting veterans out of shacks . <P> &gt;New England : no large apartment buildings built ; some progress in converting old houses . Veterans ' leaders estimate that 42,000 will be homeless in metropolitan Boston before the end of the year . <P> &gt; Detroit area : 10,000 units under construction ; many have been delayed for months by lack of materials . Hundreds of otherwise completed houses can not be used for lack of plumbing pipe . <P> &gt;Chicago area : 13,266 permits issued for apartment and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materials . Few apartments have been begun and none is likely to be completed by year 's end . <P> &gt;Denver : hundreds of new houses stand empty for lack of plumbing equipment ; other hundreds of new , occupied houses lack doors , toilet seats , light switches . <P> &gt;Southwest area : in Corpus Christi , Tex. , 350 completed houses can not be occupied because there is no plumbing pipe . In Houston , less than half of the units started have been completed . <P> &gt;California : San Francisco , which needs 41,500 units , has issued only 2,234 permits . In the Los Angeles area , some progress has been made in mass housing but without evident effect on the need .
