It has often been said that the Third Republic is dead . It has often been added , carelessly : good riddance . Last week , inside totalitarian Vichyfrance , two venerable Third Republicans suggested to the world , by their own conduct , that the democratic best of the Third Republic not only is worth restoring but will be restored . These two gentlemen , rising on their elderly legs to the stature of heroes , called Vichy a tyrant to its face , added that most Frenchmen felt as they did . The two were plump , kindly , three-times Premier Edouard Herriot , 70 , President of the dissolved Chamber of Deputies , and white-bearded Jules Jeanneney , 78 , President of the dissolved Senate . From retirement in their country homes , both near Grenoble , they sent a joint open letter to Chief of State Marshal Ptain and Chief of Government Pierre Laval . <P> With legalistic dignity the letter blasted Vichy 's dissolution of Parliament , by decree as of last Aug. 31 , as a piece of black treachery . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of legal niceties . Said Messrs . Herriot and Jeanneney : <P> " If . . . you try to draw France into war against our allies . . . do not make the foolish mistake of believing that you can win the adhesion of its spirit or its heart . . . . You have substituted unlimited dictatorship for guarantees that all civilized nations grant to accused persons . . . . Everywhere you have abolished the principle of elective representation . . . . You have wiped out general councils that reflected the wisdom of our provinces and you have substituted men of your own choice . . . . It is impossible for liberty to die in the country of its birth , from which it spread all over the world . " <P> Between these lines some observers thought they saw a signal that Vichy was about to go to war for Hitler . Said the New York Times cogently : " The cry of the old republicans is more than a cry against the final betrayal of French democracy ; it is a cry to ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France to the enemy . " <P> The cry in itself was bound to go down in any history of political freedom . It took rank with the defiant speeches of Lon Blum and Edouard Daladier at their trials at Riom ( TIME . March 2 ) . Messrs . Herriot and Jeanneney had made strong bids for places in a restored republican Pantheon . <P> Edouard Herriot has long been a one-man collection of many of the most admirable French traits . He is the fat papa type , in warmth but not in stodginess . The son of an army officer , he is a profound amateur of music , a polished man of letters . His excellent lives of Beethoven and Madame Rcamier may well outlive his political reputation . <P> As Mayor of the great textile city of Lyon , he gave it model administration for 35 years . In the Chamber and the Premiership he was a devoted internationalist , a " good European , " urging all aid to the young German democracy and to the League of Nations . But he was no easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after Hitler came to power Herriot said : " My opinion is that Germany desires a period of peace in order to prepare scientifically for war . " He was a leading advocate of Franco-Russian alliance against Hitler .
