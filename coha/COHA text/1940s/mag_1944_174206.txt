The Late George Apley ( adapted from John P. Marquand 's novel by the author and George S. Kaufman ; produced by Max Gordon ) neatly blends not-too-broad laughs with Beacon Street atmosphere . A pleasant footlighting of Marquand 's famous satire , it will doubtless detain its thin-blooded Brahmin hero ( Leo G. Carroll ) on barbarian Broadway for a shockingly long time . And if the stage Apley is portrayed a little more in the rough than in the round , he never-thanks to the fine perceptiveness and wonderful finish of Actor Carroll 's performance-turns into outright caricature . <P> Laid in 1912 , the play ( unlike the book ) introduces its hero in middle age , when the mold has hardened and the mold has begun to collect . To tradition-reflexed George Apley , Boston is Western Civilization , Emerson the Bible , Mount Auburn cemetery the carriage entrance to Heaven , and the strenuous life a round of bird walks , committee meetings and the best clubs . Sex , Apley gathers from a reading of Freud , " very largely governs the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country . " Even in Boston , to Apley 's dismay , its lure involves his son and daughter , as once long ago Apley himself had been passionately involved with a South Boston colleen . <P> It is through having to exclude the long-ago , the whole gradual development of Apley from a human bus into a human tram , that the play falls short of the book-in irony , humanity , completeness . But greatly enlivening the plotless story and largely static portraiture are a continuing comedy of Back Bay manners , the incidental commotion of Cousin Hattie 's tombstone and the best of the rather too recurrent laughs about Harvard or New York . Despite the laughs , the Apleys in the play show traces of New York blood in their veins-just enough , while slightly clouding the tone , to quicken the tempo . <P> The Streets Are Guarded ( by Laurence Stallings ; produced by John C. Wilson ) . Twenty years ago Playwright Stallings co-authored the tough , lusty What Price Glory ? , the best American play about World War I. The Streets Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fuzzy story about a heroic marine who pulls off a perilous sortie against the Japs . With a fever-ridden fanatically religious pharmacist 's mate acting as Greek chorus , it seems throughout to symbolize a modern miracle . But what it says at the end is that such " miracles " are the everyday stuff of soldiering . <P> Telling no full-sized story , The Streets Are Guarded mixes vaporish mysticism with barrack-room horseplay and talk that lacks the old punch . Over it all lies the war-at-a-distance wistfulness of a man who once lived war at first hand . Meant for a martial chant , it is more like a nostalgic ballad , too often sung rustily and off key .
