" A sponger , most likely , " he returned briefly . " Perhaps a turtler . " " But I have been informed that the natives hereabouts are uncommonindolent . Why would an honest craft man her sweeps in the heat of the day ? " He shrugged . Damned if he liked the look of this , not in such a tiny tub as the Evergreen  --  and with such a hell 's delight of a crew . Through his glass Andrew surveyed the distant vessel . It was apparent now that her hull was painted black , that her sails were brown as tobacco leaves . They slatted uselessly when , under the propulsionof six twelve-foot sweeps , the stranger pulled over the oily seas towards a long line of reefs raising an irregular barrier between her and the hopelessly becalmed Evergreen.  |p201LONG  GEORGE , the brig 's gigantic black cook , thrust a bullet-shaped head out of his galley , considered the vessel beyond the barrier reef .

All hands on deck and smartly ! Atherton . Go rout out Mr. Tompkins . " Minga Allen felt much as she had when those first Cowboys had burst out of the birch woods , but only the quickened tempo of her fan beats betrayed her growing uneasiness . Down the forecastle hatch the captain of the larboard watch bawled " A-a-11 hands on deck and stir yer blasted stumps . " The crew got to their feet leaving dark sweat marks on the deck where they had been sitting . Sleepily cursing the heat , Eli Tompkins appeared on deck . He dug knuckles into blood injected eyes and stared so stupidly about that Andrew wanted to root him one in the pants . " Wha 's wrong ? " " Plenty , " Andrew snapped . " Have the larboard watch cast off the gun covers . " " Mr. Beetle , " he called through a leather speaking horn , " re-stack that deck-load of lumber . You 'll need more room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curiously from the shade of the improvised awning . Umm . Certainly Captain Warren had served aboard a mano ' - warsome time ; no mistaking that quarterdeck briskness . He wasn't displeasing to look upon as he strode quickly , lightly about . Captain Warren turned apologetically . " Very likely nothing untowardwill chance . But in these latitudes , Ma'am , well , it 's best to keep a weather eye out . You 'll excuse my absence . " Once he had descended a short ladder to the deck , Minga Allen focused her attention upon the crew of the nearest of the three cannonscomposing the port battery . Captain Warren , extra rangy in his striped jersey , duroy knee breeches and white thread stockings , alternatelywas glancing at the distant , but still-advancing schooner and superintending the stacking of a number of roundshot in circlets of rope which kept them in position . " Smartly now , " he rasped . " God in Heaven ! Ca n't you navvies get out of the way of your own feet ? " Now rammers and spongers were being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cast loose . At this sudden activity the brig 's supply of livestock , penned in the port long boat , commenced variously to bleat , to grunt or to cackle . " Shake a leg there ! " Mr. Beetle brought a rope 's end smacking down across the shoulders of a bandy-legged seaman , belted him good and hard . The fellow snarled and so earned a swipe across the face . Minga looked away hurriedly . Spouting obscenities , Mr. Tompkinswas driving his men . She liked the second mate least of the three officers . He was so dirty  --  mentally as well as physically , and his breath was nothing if not noxious . The brig 's crew readied the vessel for action with remarkable speed for merchantmen . This was due perhaps to those frequent gun drills upon which the black-browed captain insisted , to the sharp resentmentof the crew and Mr. Tompkins no less . They claimed , and with justice , that they were no men-of-war 's men ; nevertheless the Evergreen'stall young captain had , by dint of encouragement and the liberal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Stripped to the waist and scarlet as boiled lobsters , seamen appeared from below lugging bags of grapeshot , bar shot and cylindrical sacks of gunpowder.  |p203Dark  eyes alert and bright , Andrew Warren strode back and forth . Mr. Beetle , in passing , grinned , " Keep your eyes peeled , Ma'am . Ai n't many a merchant crew can fall to so smart-like . Cap'n Warren handles ' em in true Navy style . I can tell . Served in the old Gladiator back in the ' 6o 's . " The more she thought on it , the more curious a mixture appeared Captain Warren . At once headstrong , he was also considered in his judgments ; for an ex-officer of the Royal Navy the New Englander was amazingly considerate of his crew ; on the other hand he could be downright brutal if a situation warranted the use of force . There were other puzzling aspects of his character , she mused while perspiration coursed down her ribs , thighs , everywhere  --  drops were even dripping from her fingertips . For the rock-ribbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mighty friendly with a blue-chinned French privateer captain who had ordered the brig hove-to off Hatteras . Not the least astounding of her discoveries was that Andrew Warren could speak excellent French . The object of Mistress Allen 's ponderings climbed back up on the quarterdeck , his gaunt brown face streaked with sweat . " What of the strange vessel ? " She could n't help asking . He gave her a quick look then smiled a tight smile . " She 's a big craft . Bigger than I like . " From a locker he produced a heavy cutlass with a scarred brass guard . When he had buckled it on he caught up his spyglass and once more studied the islander . The black schooner , he found , had turned and was running on a course paralleling the barrier reef . Obviously her skipper was hunting a passage through the barrier as she toiled heavily on over the shimmering bright blue sea . What most sharpened his anxiety was the discovery that the stranger 's foc'sle was fairly a-swarm . For an honest merchantman she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially reassuring either to consider the Evergreen 's crew  --  only twenty in all ; they were as motley a group as he 'd ever seen shipped . The deck load of pine planking loomed dangerously high and yellow at their backs . God pity the crew if ever a cannon ball went cracking into the lumber ; splinters would go a-flying , spreading horriblemutilation in the brig 's waist . Buckets of sand and water now stood ranged about the mast bases . ' Eli Tompkins was serving out the brig 's scant stock of blunderbusses and boarding pistols . Already , boarding pikes and a handful of battered old hangers lay in convenient places . But for all of that , Andrew mused , if the schooner indeed turned out to be a picaroon the Evergreen 's company would not stand the chance of a snowball on a hot skillet . Through his glass he now could count four  --  six gun-ports let into her starboardside . She 'd mount twelve guns in all  --  twice the brig 's armamentand her guns would be heavier by a long shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along to grant his becalmedvessel steerage way ? It was a miserably helpless feeling to watch the strange vessel continue her slow rowing along the barrier reef , like a tramp hunting a gap in a hedge row . Well , there was nothing to do but to pray that the reefs marched in unbroken ranks clean down to the horizon . He admired the Allen girl 's gift for keeping quiet , for not asking stupid unanswerable questions . Fanning herself slowly she had gone over to stand quietly beside Joe Beaver , the half-breed quartermaster . Even her white cotton stockings now had become soaked and bright and her silver and enamel bracelet felt hot . This was the worst yet . Sweat was dripping from the quartermaster 's elbows . Creak , crack ! Creak , crack ! The brig 's fabric wearily continued to yield to the oily swells . Suddenly from the crew arose a murmur , the schooner 's sweeps had stopped , then had disappeared inboard . " Now , Mr. Beetle , " Andrew Warren observed , " we 'll soon learn what yonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schooner , having lost way , also fell into the trough of the swell and commenced to rock . " No channel through the reef , " muttered Jared Beetle , " that 'll call for a boat attack . " " Wish if God there was a King 's cruiser about . " " Now if we 'd elected to navigate the Old Bahamas Pas  --  " A look from Andrew cut the sentence short . The big , red-haired mate began whistling softly , drummed thick sausage-like fingers on the rail . " Look ! Look ! They 's a thousand of ' ern ! " the frightened voice of a youth in the crew penetrated the breathless hot silence . In scrambling succession a torrent of men were tumbling over the black schooner 's side and into five small craft which had been hoisted out in slovenly fashion . Steel sparkled in brief ominous flashes from their midst . She was beyond a doubt a picaroon . Minga Allen looked hard . So far the situation had come as a welcomerelief from the unbearable monotony of this voyage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside Hudson 's River had not yet done with its consequences . For almost a week she 'd expected that , any day , she would " come ' round " as the girls back home put it . But she had n't . A delay of two weeks was n't to be shrugged away , no matter how many explanations she took refuge in . Oh damn ! If only it had been Jerry  --  not some beastly unknown foreigners now hanged higher than Haman himself . One hopep2o6 remained . She had n't been ill in the mornings and that , so the Brewster girls claimed , was the only sure-enough proof . She was startled to see Captain Warren stop his anxious parade back and forth across the quarterdeck and to hear him snap : " Mr. Beetle , order the bosun first to bend a light cable onto the sheet anchor . Then he 's to free our starboard anchor . " " Aye , aye , sir . " Patently mystified , the big mate swung off down the deck . " Mr. Tompkins ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gray whiskers . " Aye , aye , sir . " " Man the gig ! Lively now ! " " Be we a-goin ' to tow ? " " Damn your eyes , do as I say ! " Under Andrew 's immediate supervision the sheet anchor was rowed out a good two hundred yards off the starboard beam before , as covertly as possible , it was eased down among the corals . Presently the starboard anchor was dropped two hundred yards ahead and somewhat to starboard of the brig 's bowsprit . " You 've made out her name ? " Andrew demanded of the first mate on regaining the quarterdeck . Mr. Beetle nodded . " Aye , sir . She 's the Verdugo , out o ' Sant ' Jagoleastways , that 's what 's painted on her . " " Verdugo ? What 's that mean ? Below there ! " Andrew called . " Any of you know what Verdugo means ? " A very thin Negro with restless yellowish eyes knuckled his shiny scalp . " Dat Spanish , Cappen sar . Verdugo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An apt name it would seem , " Minga observed more to herself than to anyone else . " Does this mean , Captain , that we have to deal with pirates ? " " Aye , with pirates  --  or picaroons as they 're named in these lati/tudes . " Andrew nodded , his gaze on the five boats pulling away from the schooner . Flocks of curious , shrill-voiced seabirds were gliding and rocking above the rowers . He looked slowly into the gentle oval of her flushed features and said , " Pray accept my compliments , Mistress Allen . There are few females who would n't be bawling their eyes out long ere this . " " Then , sir , you seem to have been unfortunate in your acquaintanceshipwith my sex , " she replied with a primness he found exasperating . " And now , pray , what am I to do ? " His sudden warmth for her evaporated . With a bleak grin he said : " Take what you wish to the cable tier . " " The cable tier ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intend that I smother to death ? " " You will be safe there . Splinters  --  " " Safe . Did I ask to be kept safe ? Besides I am confident you will find small difficulty in driving off such a mangy pack of rogues . Why not show your colors ? I warrant a view of the British flag will send them scurrying . " " Oh rot ! " Andrew said impatiently . " They mean to plunder us and since they outnumber us by three-to-one , we are in for the bloody hell of a time . " Minga did n't like his tone , was n't accustomed to it . She straightened until her damp hair brushed the old jib . " No gentleman would employsuch language  --  " Hitherto unseen lights suddenly glinted in the jet depths of Andrew Warren 's eyes and his jaw grew long and sharp . " The devil take your finicky ways . " The silly twit ; why could n't she realize that never would the Evergreenstand in graver peril ? Still , it would accomplish nothing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who fell into their clutches . Sometimes small smoldering hulks were sighted by passing vessels . Other times half-devoured bodies came drifting up on beaches  --  bodies marked also by knife slashes  --  the corpses of women lacking ears or breasts or eyes . It was part and parcel of the picaroons ' way to see that no survivors remained to embroil them with the King 's unsympathetic and implacablemen-of-war . He glanced over the rail . Damn . Those boats were growing larger momentarily . " Mistress Allen , time grows short . " Turning aside , Andrew Warren knotted a dark blue handkerchief about his forehead . It should serve to keep his eyes free of sweat . Next he eased a pair of heavy brass-mounted pistols into a wide canvas belt . In a soft yet curiously ominous tone he said , " Madam , you astonish me . For the last time  --  will you go below ? " Color poured into cheeks already fiery with sunburn . " I will not . " " Quacko ! " Andrew beckoned a large Negro rendered hideous by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either cheek . " Sah ? " " Carry this lady down to the cable tier . " He spoke as dispassionatelyas if ordering a topsail set . " Briskly , now . " " You  --  you dare n't ! " Minga raged . He turned away as he rasped , " Quacko , obey orders ! " Minga looked frantically about . The quartermaster stood like a statue at the useless wheel , his eyes opaque . Joe Atherton stood wooden-faced beside the gun he captained . Grinning nervously the Negro shuffled forward , bare shoulders shining in the sunlight . " Do n't you dare touch me ! " A-quiver with fury Minga whirled on the figure dominating the tiny quarterdeck . " I have no choice save to submit , but I warn you , Captain Warren , my uncle is very highly considered in Jamaica . You will be held severely to account when we reach Montego Bay . " " If we get to Montego Bay , Madam , " Andrew Warren corrected deliberately.  |p209The  five picaroon boats having reached extreme range , Andrew Warren ordered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two anchor lines sloping down until they lost themselves into blue-green depths . What he had in mind might work  --  it would , certainly , had he been commanding a Continental cruiser instead of this stubby little merchantman . The pirate flotilla commenced to pick up the beat of their oars until they sent a welter of spray flashing diamond-like in the sun . Backs white , brown and black glistened as the rowers swung back and forth . Now the Evergreen 's taut and fearful crew could begin to discern details . Garbed in a brilliant miscellany of garments , the picaroons clutched their weapons and rocked their bodies to the stroke of their rowers . One after another , two big whale boats , a large gig and a pair of dugout canoes , pulled up to the line of reefs which barred the black schooner from her prey . Passed it . Came on . Jared Beetle , the Long Island Tory , swung up , his hard features eager . " They 'll just about be in range , sir . " A ring set in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ em have a few rounds ? " " Not yet , Mr. Beetle . " " But , sir ,  --  " " Get to your station ! Blast your soul to hell , I 'm commanding here . " If only he 'd a pair of gun crews out of the Andrew Doria . " Aye , aye , sir . " The mate nodded ; he was coming to understand Andrew Warren . Unexpectedly the Indian quartermaster spoke . " Wind come , Cappen , byme by . " His eyes , vitreous black in the flat plane of his features , swung over the brig 's stern . Up to the northwest the least dim ghost of a cloud was drifting over the horizon . Though Joe Beaver might be right , there was n't a chance in the world that a breath of wind could arrive before the black schooner 's crew was alongside . " Mr. Tompkins , show our colors , " Andrew flung over his shoul/der ; sight of the Red Ensign just might give the picaroons pause . As the signal halyard block @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stranger 's force ; the five crowded and rapidly approaching boats were not two hundred yards distant . A smothered groan arose from the Evergreen 's crew . Sight of the British flag had given the enemy no pause whatsoever ; no reaction at all ensued beyond a brief commotion which caused steel to flicker palely in the boats . Apparently the prolonged absence of Royal patrol ships had lent the islanders courage . Nov the cries of the coxswains , urging on the oarsmen , came clearly over the water . " Unos , dos , tres !  --  " " Un , deux , trois !  --  " " Wan , two , t'ree ! " The cadence was being set in three or more languages . The picaroonswere predominately dark-skinned . Andrew recognized pure black Negroes , mustees , sambos . All looked wild , some half-naked in ragged , wide-brimmed straw hats , others wearing a panache of vari-colored macaw , flamingo or parrot feathers . Now and then one of the raiders would stand up , scream somethingunintelligible , and flourish an axe or a machete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt his belly muscles tighten . It did n't look now as if Dr. Blanchard would ever see those medicines ; a great shame , too . Andrew 's recollections of that hideous place called the Drydock remained vivid . Curse the ineffective weight of his broadside ! They 'd have to let the enemy come dangerously close before it would be of use . To the distant schooner 's signal gaff climbed a red banner which hung limp until an errant puff of air stirred it enough to reveal its design . A skeleton crudely executed in white was flanked by two sprawling initials which Andrew made out as a C and a P. " Means they 'll grant us no quarter , " grunted the Evergreen 's gaptoothedgunner . A sudden fierce clamor arose from the boats . Swaying easily to his vessel 's motion , Andrew cast a quick look down the deck . In patterns repeated thrice his crew fidgeted at battlep211stations ; five men were manning each of the three little guns . At the moment Joe Atherton and the other gun captains were blowing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ linstocks . He levelled his speaking trumpet . " Make ready ! " " Aye , aye , sir ! " Eagerly the gun crews galvanized into motion . The Number Fours leaned far out through the gun ports and soaked their sponges alongside . Number Threes , holding rammers ready , waited while the three little four-pounders were trundled forward by means of block and tackle until their muzzles peered out through the trued-up gun ports . The crews then stood clear of the recoil path and raised red , black and brown sweaty faces to the tall and erect figure on the quarterdeck . Joe Beaver , however , kept his attention on that long gray cloud to the northwest . Perceptibly , it had gained in density as well as in size . In his Naval officer 's tone , Andrew addressed the crew , told them that no one was to go below in any case , save to fetch ammunition . Mr. Beetle had orders to shoot down anyone who attempted to do so . Crisply he called his commands . " Number One gun sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the two canoes . " The picaroons began to row faster and so hard that their sweeps bent in flat arcs . In the prow of the leading boat a huge black pirate in a yellow jersey balanced himself and commenced roaring threats in a guttural African dialect as he swung his cutlass in furious glitteringarcs . No use waiting any longer . Andrew drew a deep breath , shouted , " Fire ! " Number One 's gun captain , a hairy little fellow , pursed his lips and blew hard on his match . Muscles rippled across his bare back when he leaned to hold his match to the little four pounder 's touchhole . Instantlythe priming gave a sibilant huh ! and a small jet of smoke sprang vertically into the air . The Number One gun belched a great gray blossom of smoke out * , f the gun port and sprang back like a thing alive . The cannon's breeching cable , snapped taut , checked the recoil . Compared to the report of a twelve or fourteen pounder these little four pounders certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damn it ! " Andrew 's heart skipped a beat . A fountain of water had played briefly half-way between the leadingboat and the line of reefs . Worse still , Number Two gun 's roundshot also went skipping harmlessly over the sea for all the world like a flat stone flung by a boy . Jerusha ! These merchant crews handled their guns like a gang of seamstresses . At such range there was absolutely no excuse for missing . Number Three gun , Atherton 's , did a trifle better , its projectile barely missed the big longboat on the left of the flotilla 's line . " Christ above ! " Mr. Beetle was tugging furiously at a training tackle . " You dumb bastards could n't hit a blind ox on the rump with a scoop shovel . " Andrew standing taut behind the wheel felt aghast . Three clean misses and the time lost was irretrievable . He tried to inject cool confidence into his command  --  as a good officer would in a critical moment . This was the hell of most merchant gun crews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd been taught . " With langrage , re-load . Briskly now . And if you miss this time you 'll get no third try . " This was obvious . The leading boat was surging up not a hundred yards distant . " Lay Number Two gun yourself , " Andrew flung at Beetle . In two quick leaps he gained the main deck . Should have been there to start with . From the nearest tub of langrage  --  odds and ends of scrap iron , nails , broken glass , musket balls and bits of chain  --  he shovelled. three scoopfuls into the muzzle of his cannon , only half aware that the voices beyond the rail were sounding ominously near and had become altered to a more savage pitch . Bo-om-m ! Jed Beetle 's piece let go , but Andrew confined his attention to the handspikes as his crew traversed the four pounder . Overp213the bulwark sang a number of musket balls which cut holes in the main sheet flapping brown and useless over head . Andrew pierced the powder cartridge in his piece by expertly employinga @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end off a priming quill filled with fine four F. French powder , spilled its contents down the touchhole and smoothed the black grains in place . " Abajo los Ingleses ! " " Mort ! " " No quarter , you bloody sea-going grocers . " A regular gale of cries now came ringing over the rail . The clamor of the picaroons put Andrew in mind of a pack of hounds ravening at the foot of a ' coon tree.  |p214WHEN  , at seventy-five yards ' range , Andrew Warren touched off his piece , the little cannon kicked like a curried colt and a cloud of acrid , rotten-smelling heat beat back into his face . " Hump yourselves , " he panted at the gun crew even before the breeching blocks had ceased clattering . Screams , howls and breathlessobscenities penetrated the lazy curtain of smoke . When the screen thinned , his gun crew raised a delighted yelp . Through the gunport they could see that the gun had scored a clean hit which had carried away the starboard oars of the big , dull red-painted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side , the whaler was moving now in a slow circle to port with her remaining rowers attempting to switch enough oars over to get their craft back on a straight course . As it was she was effectively block-. ing the course of the next boat behind and , at the same time , offering an almost unmissable target . Forward , Joe Atherton 's thick voice could be heard cursing his black gun crew . " Put your backs to it , you club-footed baboons  --  else you 'll smile in hell . " Once Number One gun was reloaded Andrew forced himself to sight carefully at that brilliantly lit tangle of jerseys , shirts and bare bodies in the whale boat . Using a leaded mallet , he gave several taps to one of those quoins which elevated or depressed the four pounder 's muzzle . Setting his teeth , he caught up the linstock and touched off his piece.  | " Small arms ! Man the rail ! " he yelled , well aware that if this time the charge went wide there would be no opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rail . Yonder was a sight he would n't readily forget . Where the whaler had been , only pieces of planking , broken oars , several hats and small kegs bobbed about amid a patch of water varying from pale pink to a deep scarlet in color . Half a dozen picaroons struggled in the water and kept up a terrified screaming . Brushing sweat from his brow Andrew realized that Mr. Beetle 's gunnery , too , had been effective . Further out , one of the canoes was down by the stern and filling fast . The three other boats had , by a miracle , stopped in confusion . " Man the guns ! For your lives ! " In frantic haste the brig 's crew dropped their pikes and blunderbussesand dashed back to their cannon . Such an undreamt of opportunitywas n't likely to offer itself for long . Panting , the gunners reached into the langrage tubs set on the lumber piled behind them . Bolts , sections of crow bar , small rocks and even a set of broken-up stove lids went into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had closed enough for real execution . Meanwhile the stricken canoe turned lazily onto her beam , spilling into the blue-green water those of her crew who had not already gone overboard . " Oo , bloody roar ! " bellowed one of the crew . " Ai n't that clippie ' the niggers ' combs for ' em ? " " Hold your fire ! " At too great a range for langrage the swearing picaroons were backing away , absolutely ignoring the frantic pleas and blasphemies of their comrades struggling in the water . Snapped Andrew , " Reload with grape . " " Wind come , " called the halfbreed , his leather-hued features impassive . That was true enough . Far off to the northeast the aching blueness of the Caribbean was becoming ruffled . Andrew 's thrill of elation faded ; beyond a doubt the breeze would reach the schooner first.  | Even so there was room for more hope than he had ever dreamed possible . So far no one aboard the Evergreen had been hit and his crew were steadying down  --  even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last were perceiving the great advantage lent them by the brig 's lack of steerage way . Raising hoarse cries , they circled for a second to advance , but this time in line with the Evergreen 's bow where none of the guns could be brought to bear . " This passes bearance , " Minga Allen decided amid the fetid darknessof the cable tier . " If there is no more cannonading , I 'll go on deck . That blackheaded villain has no right to condemn me to stew in this wretched place . " Certainly life was making up in a hurry for those long , placid years in Brewster . Imagine being aboard a vessel attacked by buccaneers ! She passed a forefinger over her forehead to scrape away sticky sweat which kept trickling down into her eyes . Suppose the brig were taken . What would happen ? She wished she 'd thought to stop in her cabin for the little pocket pistol Major de Vaux had pressed upon her . Merciful Heavens ! It was really stifling in this complete darkness . She suppressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All along she 'd heard the loathsome creatures scuffling and squeaking among the coils of sour-smelling cable . It was miserable , this not knowing what was happening on deck . She thought she recognized the dull rumble of gun carriage wheels being hauled back and forth . Oaths such as she had never before heard sounded just overhead . A twist of cable kept digging into her thigh , another was chafing her back , and her arms were being continuallypricked by hemp fibers . Of course , she would have left off her stays today , for the first time . When a rat nipped at her ankle she could n't stand it any longer . Bathed in perspiration she commenced to crawl out of the cable hold . " Man the windlass ! " Right over her head Captain Warren was speaking . " Put your backs to it , you misbegotten sons of whores ! "  |p217When  he saw her , Andrew Warren could n't for the life of him restrain a broad grin . If Minga Allen had not always been so neat , so crisp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ludicrous to see her there in the blazing sunlight with her chestnut hair hanging in damp and grimy ringlets , and her pale blue gown smeared with muck and green slime from the cables . She was so wrathful she had failed to realize that one of her garters had become unfastened , permitting a stocking to sag and wrinkle . Profuse perspiration had caused her clothes to adhere to her figure with treacherous fidelity . Certainly she 'd no idea that her up-turned nose was gleaming pink as any carnation . Rigid , she halted before him . " And on top of everything else you  --  you d-dare to laugh at me . Oh-h , you infamous b-boor ! Oh-h  --  if only  --  " Anticipating his passenger 's intention , Andrew intercepted Minga Allen 's hand before its palm reached his cheek . They stood an instant glowering at each other while the Evergreen continued to roll rhythmicallyon the glassy swells . " Why are you on deck ? " he demanded , a wicked gleam in the depths of his dark eyes . " I ordered you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to quiver . " I 'll not return to th-that p-pest hole . You m-may as well know that ! " The grim angle to his jaw relaxed . " Please , Mistress Allen , my intent in ordering you below is only  --  " " To p-prove your authority , to bully , t-to humiliate me  --  to  --  to  --  " "  --  To preserve you from hurt . " " I will not go below again . " When she wrenched free her hand , he stepped back . " I had rather d-die in the sunlight than s-smother in that revolting darkness . " She had intended to say more , to give this fellow such a tonguelashingas would release some of the fear and shame and bitterness which had been poisoning her peace of mind ever since Jerry had smiled and drifted away into Eternity . Yet further speech seemed inadvisable . Captain Warren looked distinctly formidable in his battered straw hat and jersey ripped across one shoulder . The brass- mounted butts of the boarding pistols in his belt flashed like angry eyes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advancing boats . " Stay on deck then , but keep out of the way . " " I will , and be damned to you , Captain Warren , " she was amazed to hear her voice sputtering . Andrew Warren 's strategy in running out the two anchors became apparent when he sent a gang up onto the quarterdeck . Grinning , the seamen brushed past the Allen girl . Phew ! They stank to high Heaven . " Tail onto the sheet anchor line , " Andrew instructed his men while keeping one eye on the three remaining picaroon boats . From this angle , they calculated , never a one of the motionless vessel 's guns could be brought to bear because of lack of steerageway . On his low-pitched command of " Heave away , sheet anchor men ! " , the brig slowly commenced to swing to . Yard by yard the anchor line was hauled , dripping , in over the starboard quarter , and , one after another , the grim iron mouths of the three little cannons began to bear . Over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Without wind the becalmed brig should have lain helpless , awaiting her doom like a moose stuck in a snowdrift and ringed by wolves . " Ay Dios ! Qu hay ? Vamos aprisa ! " The picaroons , a gaunt , tawdry rabble , garbed in a vivid assortment of ragged silk shirts , tunics , hats and equipment , were too close to flee immediately . The brig 's port battery poured grape shot into the biggest canoe , briefly churned the water about it into a white lather . Musket balls peppered the sea just short of the remaining whaler . Heart in mouth , Minga watched a whole cluster of picaroons knocked spinning into the water . Their weapons flickered wildly through their efforts to maintain balance . She got dazed impressions of Mr. Beetle waving encouragements to his gun crew , of Joe Ather/ton , his pinched features brightened , standing near the Captain , of Andrew Warren standing in the hot sunshine , hands outflung to check the cable crew at his side . " Way enough ! Quick , Beetle , quick ! Give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're out of range . " Clearly , the boat crews had had enough . They were backing water in a hurry , oblivious of the desperate entreaties of their fellows who remained clinging to the shattered whaler . When safely out of range , the outlaws put about and began pulling back to the black schooner lurking beyond the reefs . Unforgettably piercing became the screams of the picaroons who remained swimming or clinging to the wrecked whalers and canoes . Several triangular , slate-gray fins had begun cutting the sea 's surface in sudden , dreadfully swift maneuvers which brought them successivelynearer to the men in the water . By fives and tens sharks and barracudas congregated . Already the brig 's crew commenced to witness chilling sights through the crystallinewaters of the Caicos Passage . Fishes , dazzlingly brilliant in color , were ripping at those bodies or parts of bodies which already reposed on the channel 's bottom . Under their tearing assault one of the submerged corpses , that of a Negro , seemed , incredibly , to regain life . Like a marionette , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left of its legs . A large , black-bearded buccaneer was swimming awkwardly toward the motionless brig . " Help , mates . The sharks  --  in Gawd 's name do n't let  --  " The speaker broke off short . One of those deadly fins vanished a few yards distant , and the white of the monster 's belly glimmered as it turned over . " Oh-h ! My God ! " The swimmer 's head vanished under water with magical speed . He reappeared an instant later , yowling amid a crimsonbath , then disappeared for good . The clamor of the remaining picaroons reminded Andrew of such sounds as escaped the Lexington after taking a hulling shot . There was nothing to be done . Even had the swimmers deserved the leastp220consideration , the sharks would have completed their massacre of the picaroons before a boat could be manned . In a futile frenzy of terror some survivors attempted to crawl up on the battered skeleton of their whaler , but all they accomplished was to cause it to roll over . The sea all about appeared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched a lemon-featured mestee start swimmingdesperately towards the Evergreen . In the blue water his scarlet shirt showed bright . Teeth gleamed as he held up an imploring hand and yelled : " Una linea , Senores ! Por piedad , una lineal " " Ah-h the ' ell with yer ! " shouted Joe Atherton whose bared back revealed a shiny and puckered criss-cross pattern of whitish scars . " Ye 'd ' ave slit our bleedin ' craws fer us ! ' Ere 's a preserver fer yer ! " Stooping , he caught up a round shot and hurled it at the swimmer . Before the missile struck the surface , however , a gray and white outline flashed up under the mulatto 's bare brown legs . After a brief , furious commotion , the shark sped on leaving the upper half of the mulatto 's body to zigzag down , trailed by a dense comet 's tail of brilliant scarlet . Soon there resounded no more shouts . Of the stricken boats and their crews nothing remained save scattered debris , a few oars and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soddenly . Thousands of sea birds , aroused from the reefs by the gunfire , still wheeled and darted overhead , their shadows tracing and retracing swift patterns across the Evergreen 's deck . " That were a bloody smart trick , if I may say so , sir . " The brig 's Cockney gunner wagged his head approvingly . " Saving that sheet anchor , them ruddy villians would be aboard o ' us this minute . " Andrew was as pleased as he was surprised . Jerusha ! Half an hour ago he 'd not have wagered a sixpence on the Evergreen 's chances of escape . Yet here she was , unboarded and whole save for a few musket balls through her canvas . Minga Allen , stony-faced because of those despairing cries which yet rang in her ears , sought the shade of the mainsheet . Her kneesp221were trembling and she realized , dully , that one of her stockings had sagged down about her ankle . So this was what a sea battle was like ? Well , there was no denying that Captain Warren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To Joe Beaver and Andrew Warren it became evident that a real breeze was now not far off , but  --  and therein lay a big " but "  --  it would almost certainly fill the schooner 's sails first . Suppose , with her much heavier battery , the picaroon should sail close up the barrierreefs ? There could be no doubt that the Evergreen would then be in range . Andrew thought a long minute , then to the starboard watch gave orders to heave in on the bow line as quickly as the sheet anchor was raised . " I collate you aim to tow , sir ? " Eli Tompkins possessed a genius for commenting on the obvious . " To kedge and tow . The whiskeradoes could play hob with us here . Looks like a long eight is mounted amidships . " Since the Verdugo  --  the name was now clearly visible through Andrew 's glass  --  was hoisting her boats inboard and getting out her sweeps it became apparent that the buccaneers intended to continue their attack ; at all costs , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Verdugo was looting British merchantmen . Mr. Beetle in the long boat commenced to tow the Evergreen while the gig ran out a light anchor as fast as the men , panting over the capstan bars , could walk in the dripping anchor line . " They 're gaining , sir , closing range fast , " Jed Beetle warned from the bows , " and the reefs bow in our direction . " " Starboard your helm ! " Andrew directed the half-breed Penobscot . Under a puff of wind  --  the first to ruffle the Caicos Passage in three eternal days  --  the black schooner heeled gently and , in response to her helm , commenced to bear down on her still becalmed prey . " Pull her head ' round , " Andrew shouted . Presenting his stern to the enemy would offer a smaller target . " Pull ! Pull , you damned jelly backs ! " Jed Beetle also foresaw the Impending danger . The boat crews made their oars bow with effort and their blades churned the sea into a welter of flying spray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dirty gray smoke ; then , a split second later , the Evergreen shuddered as if she had struck a rock . A deadly crackling noise such as Andrew had not heard in almost a year filled the air . He flung up a warning arm as a dense shower of splinters from the deck load went flying in all directions . Like deadly yellow arrows , jagged barbs of wood flew upwards , piercing the limp canvas , littering the deck or falling far out over the sea . Two , three hands lay motionless in the shadows of the rigging . Forward a man began screaming . Unluckily , the boat crews lost their rhythm , commenced to scramble ineffectually with their oars , whereupon the brig lost headway and , under influence of the current , once more commenced to present her beam to the enemy . It was a revelation to Minga Allen to witness how surely , how rapidly , the brig 's captain met the emergency . His voice was not especially loud , but it carried as he ordered Tompkins ' men to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despatched the carpenter and his mate to estimate the damage . " Get those bodies overboard ! " he flung at the boatswain . The hurt sailor kept on whimpering and rocking back and forth , as Long George the cook , with a red hot poker , cauterized a gaping hollow in the sufferer 's thigh . Captain Warren gave a furious look at his own useless battery  --  the range was hopeless for four-pounders  --  then , with Beaver 's help , he swung the main boom outboard , ready to catch the first suspicion of wind . In skittish cat's-paws the breeze , with agonizing deliberation , was nearing the Evergreen . Purple-faced , Andrew wheeled , beckoned to the girl crouched round-eyed by the binnacle . " Bear a hand on the helm , " he rasped . " If you 're set on staying on deck , you 'll work ! " She gave him one startled look , then ran to obey . " You can steer ? " " A little . " Aye , a very little . All she 'd ever learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Take wheel , " he panted . " Beaver 'll be needed elsewhere . " Alreadythe carpenter 's hatchet had begun ringing in the bows . The boat crews were working in unison again so the brig started to swing end on . Boom-m-m ! The Verdugo fired again . Making an eerie screech , a round shot whistled up , punched a ragged hole in the main sheet before it raised a brief geyser in the blue water off the starboard bow . Aware that their prey had regained motion , the outlaws fired a whole broadside and with devastating effect . A chain-shot cut away the main starboard shrouds and two more hit the brig hard under her counter and right at the water-line . Aware of a nerve pulsing fiercely in his cheek , Andrew ran to the rail and looked over . Hell 's roaring bells ! The sea was fairly sluicing in through a jagged hole in the side . A heart-chilling litter of broken planks and splinters was floating alongside . " Hold her steady ! " he flung at the girl . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crack of that disastrous broadside had died away . Minga Allen felt the breath drawn from her lungs , felt an invisible palm smite her across the face . A stay dangling loose was severed not two feet from her nose , its lower end striking the deck with a gentle thump . Death had passed her by just that much . Nor had it missed Captain Warren by any greater margin . He licked his lips but kept on knotting the parted main sheet . " Clumsy beggars , " he grunted , then glanced up . " Steady the wheel ! Here 's the breeze . " A faint creaking sounded aloft as , simultaneously , the weatherstainedcanvas lost its lifeless look . Minga shook the hair out of her eyes , gave the brig 's wheel a half turn , just to get the " feel " of the water . Andrew felt relieved . He guessed she could steer all right . Good stuff , Minga Allen . She might have been churning butter for all the fright she showed standing there with legs braced apart , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " First shot , sir , took us under the cathead ' twixt wind and water . " " Got your sheet lead and oakum to work ? " " Aye , aye , sir  --  but there 's nigh three foot in the forward well a'ready . " " Damnation ! Mr. Beetle ! Man the forward pump . " It was fine all the same to feel the Evergreen stir and go creeping up to overtake the tow boats . As if to accelerate the crew 's efforts , the Verdugo fired a second thunderous broadside . The picaroon , having reached the limit of pursuit , commenced firing at top speed while hovering just inside the barrier of reefs . Minga 's throat went dry , strange little shivers needled the backs of her hands and darted down her loins . Suppose one of those roundshots struck really close ? Splinters were flying everywhere . When a heavy roundshot smashed into the foc'sle her fingers froze to the wheel handles . It made a noise like some Titan cutting kindling . Another shot shattered the quarterboat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , hurled a javelin-like splinter at Long George . It pierced the cook through the stomach . Coughing thickly , the Negro tugged at the jagged length of the splinter with both hands . Slowly his knees buckled and he swayed violently , staring in white-eyed horror to see his blood meanderingoff towards the scuppers . The sand thickened the flow into dreadful crimson lumps . He fell , squirming slowly . Another cannonball tore through the port bulwarks , stretched two seamen quivering on the deck . One of the hens had fallen into the water , where it flopped desperately about until a shark got it . Despite her terrific punishment the Evergreen began to pick up speed . Now the tow boats were bumping alongside , disgorging their sunburned crews . Through eyes smarting with sweat , Andrew glanced aft . The Allen girl had given over the wheel to Joe Beaver and now was crouched under the bulwarks , her features deadly white beneath her sunburn . Intently , she was studying the battle-torn mainsail . A softp225gurgling sounded alongside as , with painful slowness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From aloft came a series of creaks when the brig 's yards swung about against their parrals . The slick look of the sea had disappeared and some of the sun 's crushing heat was fading . The picaroons commenced firing furiously but , because of the diminished proportions of their target and of the increasing range , their roundshot scored no more hits , only raised tall waterspouts from among the bubbles drifting lazily in the Evergreen 's wake . The carpenter returned , his whiskered , terrier-like face very grave . " We 're hit bad , sir , the hole for'ard is worst . " " Shall I have some guns shifted aft ? " " Aye , aye , sir . The quicker the better . " Andrew raged along the deck , roused his panting crew with fists and searing language . Some he set to pumping , some to helping the carpenter . Mr. Beetle and he cast loose those cannons nearest the forecastle . When their weight was shifted the brig 's battered bow became noticeably elevated.  |p226JOE  ATHERTON , his cheeks filled and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' - war style . The salute gave Andrew a poignant , reminiscent twinge . Still , he 'd probably never fight in a stiffer engagementaboard a cruiser , than the one the Evergreen had fought today . That was some consolation . " Vittles are ready , sir . I 've warned Mistress Allen , sir , and she 's waiting in the cabin . " The last traces of pallor were gone from the deserter 's features , also that pinched look from about his mouth and eyes . " Lord , " thought Andrew , " so it 's time to eat . " He did n't feel much like it , not when he thought of the five dead men , overboard and doubtless devoured by those sharks which kept dogging the battered brig . The crew did n't like the way the sharks were keeping the Evergreencompany ; took it as an ill omen . But , as Mr. Beetle unconcernedlyput it , " A sailor who 's ' feared of gettin ' hurt had better bide ashore . " " Very well , Atherton , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the galley . " Leaving Tompkins on duty , heavily he swung down the **25;7483;TOOLONG . Until now , he had scarcely noticed a long , shallow gash in his left forearm ; for the life of him he could n't recall when he had received it . But now it was smarting infernally . Jet hair tumbling over his eyes and quite unaware that he was smudged black as any Coromantee with burnt powder grains , An/drew paused before the main cabin . Here , perforce , the table had been set . In entering , he bent his head to avoid his cabin lamp rockingrhythmically on its gimbals . If Mistress Allen was ready so promptly , it argued that she was going to complain about his having sent her to the cable tier , about his having elected to descend Caicos instead of the Leeward Passage . A pity she 'd overheard the port captain back in New York advise the latter course . She was standing looking out of the stern ports , her long slim body yielding gracefully to the brig 's revitalized motion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thought , in a light green gown . " Good evening , Captain , " she greeted . " I trust the damage is being successfully repaired ? " He bowed low from the waist , in the ceremonious manner Captain Nicholas Biddle demanded of his officers . " The carpenter is working , Madame . " He lent the title a French inflection . " But we 've been badly hulled and that 's a fact ! I am sorry if I caused you any inconvenience . " Why was she considering him so steadily ? Plague take it , it was so dark he could n't rightly read her expression . " I regret having earned your displeasure in that matter of the cable tier , " he apologized heavily . " I felt that we stood in greater peril than you appreciated . " " I do not doubt that , sir , " she returned evenly . A brief silence fell , disturbed only by dishes clattering gently against the fiddles which kept them from sliding onto the cabin floor . He reached for the brass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Madame . I will make efforts to repair it . " " Do n't go just yet , Captain Warren . I must first  --  well  --  I must praise your extremely clever maneuver with  --  with the anchors . " Suddenly Minga 's reserve broke . The sweet oval of her face lit and her words came out a-tumbling , like a litter of puppies from a kennel . " Really , Captain  --  I  --  You were magnificent throughout ! So collected , so shrewd , so  --  so  --  commanding ! " He was taken utterly off stride , felt a great warm flood of gratitude well up within him . This was not at all what he 'd been expecting  --  not by a long shot . Here he 'd been all braced to meet a furious tirade ; instead , she stood there , friendly , a smile curving her wide and vivid mouth . " Why , why  --  " he stammered , " I scarcely deserve such  --  such  --  Nom de Dieu , Madame , you are much too kind . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Indeed , it is you who deserve unmeasuredpraise . I shall find it hard to forget your trick at the wheel . " " La , sir , there was no leisure in which to become frightened . " Her lashes fell as her gaze flickered to the shattered glass of the stern port . He looked so dreadfully tired she wondered why she 'd been so hard on him . After all , he was a Loyalist and he 'd had nothing to do with Jerry 's death  --  or the rest of it . Goodness , if he ever suspected  --  a ghastly suspicionseized her . Colonel Saunders  --  what if he 'd guessed that she had to leave  --  until she could be sure , at least ? He passed her with the intention of entering his cabin . She turned to confront him . " Tell me , Captain , why are the Yankees so arrogant as to boast that only their women possess fortitude ? Why do they protest that Englishwomen are more timorous than mice ? " Unwisely , Andrew interrupted , " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plain as a pike staff . You 're an American  --  er , Colonial , that is , " he added and wondered if he had caught the error in time . Her smile vanished . " 1 am not American ! " she burst out passionately . " I 'd die sooner than ever to be called one of those snivelling , mock-heroic hypocrites called Patriots : " Beside the quarterdeck 's lee rail they paused to consider the sea rushing softly , smoothly by . Sudden bursts of phosphorus glowed among waves curling rhythmically away from the brig 's side . Now that the sun had gone down at long last , the air was cool and full of balm . The wind set halyards , braces , and shrouds to strumming a gentle obbligato . It whipped Minga Allen 's petticoats into a white froth any instant she left them unguarded.  | " Have there ever been more stars out at one time ? " she demanded , her face tilted to the topmasts and the black rectangles formed by the topsails . " Are n't they like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chuckled . " Puts me more in mind of sugar spilled over a blue china dish . Still it 's a fine sight . " He felt all but at ease . The picaroons lay safe leagues astern and his ship was running free again , unleashed from that accursed calm . Why could n't he be rid of a small , but persistent , worry nagging at his peace of mind ? Most likely ' t was the sound of the pump clank-clanking endlessly . If only the carpenter had appeared more certain concerning the damage caused by the Verdugo 's first broadside . It was n't pleasant to have to admit that some of the salt fish , vegetables and rice middlings in the forward hold could not have avoided damage . Well , nothing much could be done till the Evergreen reached Jamaica and could be hove down . Reaction from the sharp stress of the afternoon left him mellow , avid of gentleness . The girl beside him must have guessed his mood . Said she softly , leaning elbows on the rail and staring fixedly out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared distant and self-absorbed this voyage , I pray you to forgive me , Captain Warren . My only explanation is  --  " she fumbled feverishly a second , " is that every last farthing I have left in this world is aboard this vessel . " " Left ? " " My trunks and chests hold all which remains of my father 's estate after the Rebel Committee of Public Safety burnt Millwood , my home . " She spoke less passionately , " You see , sir , my Mother never recovered from Papa 's  --  murder . The Liberty Boys thought it sport to drag him in a cart through a January night , to half drown him in a horse trough . " " Not truly ! " He 'd heard of such things , had Andrew , but he 'd never set much store by them . " Aye , Captain , truly indeed . Papa was near seventy years and so took the lung fever and died . " " ' T was no sense in such actions , " Andrew burst out . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employ moderate language , " Minga observed . The helmsman , a squat mustee with a bandage glimmering on one wrist , stood , jet eyes fixed on the compass card swaying in the binnacle . Faintly , light from within it gilded his blunt features , lent life to a dirty red shirt he wore open to the belt . Minga was aware of Andrew Warren 's increased proximity , of his interest . Her pulses stirred , commenced to beat a quicker tempo . " In Jamaica I hope to begin a new life  --  to dismiss America foreverfrom my memory . " Her voice gained strength born of a determinationslowly conceived . " I shall live for a while with my Aunt Adelina  --  the widow of Sir Thomas Moffat of Moffat 's Penn . It 's situated near Montego Bay . " " Penn ? What in time 's a penn ? " Andrew knew very well , but to keep the conversation alive any excuse would serve . " A penn , I 'm told , is Jamaican for a plantation  --  a stock-raising plantation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Her hair had at last broken free of its ribbon . She made no effort to control it . Since she had dressed it with French scent , no harm would be done if a tress blew across Captain Warren 's lean features . How badly hurt was his arm ? Though he made no to-do over it , he was favoring it the cooler the night grew . " So , sir , you see me as I am , " she declared , " venturing forth with only a scant store of silks , lace , and silverware ' twixt me and a confoundeddisinterested world . " He could n't help but admire her attempt at jauntiness . " You have not met this aunt ? " " Oh , no . Mama had n't even heard from Aunt Adelina since  --  since this trouble . " " Jerusha ! Then you are n't certain your Aunt is at Montego Bay ? " Body yielding to the brig 's gentle pitching , Minga considered him , round-eyed . " Why , of course , she must be there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Aunt Adelina was  --  well ,  --  capable and was n't afraid of anything and was kind  --  when she had heir way with people . " Andrew bit off an acid comment which only a Frenchman would have understood . Well , if Mistress Allen had chosen to voyage so far on a gamble , it was Mistress Allen 's lookout . Apparently , she 'd no conception of what life in the Sugar Islands was like . Seemed she 'd never heard of yellow jack , sunstroke , cholera , or rebellious slaves , either . She directed a sudden glance at him . " And you , sir , own an interest in this vessel ? " For all the glistening stars , it was too dark to see her well . He struggled to resume an instinctive distrust . " The brig belongs to my uncle . " " And where is his business ? " Andrew remembered his long-rehearsed answer . " On Long Island  --  at Northport . " " Surely General Clinton will soon whip these rascally Rebels into submission . " Lucky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood rush into his face . Damn this baggage ! If she 'd seen the " rascally rebels " aboard the Enterprise serving their decrepit guns until they burst , had seen them suffer the surgeon 's cold steel  --  but she had n't . Let it go . Calmly , he said , " No doubt you 're right , Madame , but I venture Sir Henry will find the matter none so easy . " " Possibly . But , sir , surely God will help to punish such infamous scoundrels . " He stood for the moment astonished clear out of resentment . " Surely you do not deem all Rebels as infamous scoundrels ? " Her voice sounded crisp and cold as the crunch of a snowshoe on a crusted drift . " Never in all the world 's history has the name of Liberty been so debased , so perverted by a pack of savage rogues . " Andrew Warren made the evenly spaced seas an object of intense interest . He had to hang on to himself . Dr. Blanchard was counting the days . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the men who had followed Montgomery and Arnold up along that tortured trail to Quebec  --  and back ; who even now were starving and scratchingvermin in miserable cantonments outside of Philadelphia . Now he really pitied her  --  her and her smug , cool attitude . It was n't to be tolerated . For the life of him Andrew could n't help retorting , " Mistress Allen , did you ever hear of the French philosopher who once observed that , All broad statements are false  --  including this one ' ? " The girl , standing straight and slim , considered him with new attention . The starlight emphasizing the length of her eye sockets , lent them a suggestion of the Orient . " Indeed , Captain Warren , you are the most perplexing man I have yet encountered . " Mighty stiff , Andrew turned again to face her . " I am flattered , Madame , indeed I am . " " You quote French philosophers , yet during the voyage I have observed how you agonize over your log . I 'll warrant you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quite correct , Madam , yet I guess I could spell vixen ' without batting an eye . " He figured Mistress Allen would fire up , but she only threw back her head and laughed , the starlight glinting on her teeth . He could n't help liking her for it . " A well-placed shot , Captain , " she admitted . Why did she plague him so ? If ever she 'd needed , craved kindliness , a measure of affection , it was tonight . Her nerves were yet all raw and quivering from that vision of Long George pierced through the stomach . Her hair , free now , was whipping out in fragile gonfalons . She moved a step closer . The hush-hushing of the waves alongside all but hid her soft , " Sir , I had not intended to provoke you . Will you forgive me ? " So the girl had some coquetry to her ? " About my schooling , Ma'am , you are in the right . " His accent returned to New England . " I spent more time plaguing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He leaned towards her , suddenly young in his amusement , his darkp233features alight . " You should have seen the day I varnished the seat of his stool with fish glue . ' T was in the dead of winter so when Master Thaxter sat himself down , the glue warmed . And  --  " "  --  You provoked him , " Minga cut in , " and the schoolmaster jumped up and  --  " "  --  Tore the whole seat out of his breeches ! How could you have known that ? " he demanded over the monotonous slobbering of the forward pump . " You  --  you did n't do the same ? " Something like a giggle escaped Minga . " Ruined Mrs. Higginbotham'sbest show ' petticoat . " " I got caned , " Andrew said . Minga dropped her voice as the whole scene came back to her ever so vividly . She could even see the Shaw girl 's little dog waiting in the dappled sunlight outside the door of Mrs. Higginbotham 's Female Academy for Polite Arts . Absently she tested the soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of the whole school . Mrs. Higginbothameven made me kiss the switch . " " I guess getting a whipping 's all right , " said he , " but that last , the kissing , was a mean thing to do .

" You have been a Naval officer , have n't you ? " So quickly did she alter her topic , Andrew was caught unprepared . " Yes , " he admitted and wished she would n't consider him so directly . " In which of His Majesty 's ships ? " What the devil ? Had she grown suspicious ? " Aboard the H.M.S. Racehorse , and a few other men-o ' - war . " He took refuge in evasion . " Which others ? " " The Edward , sloop , and others so small you would never have heard of them . " He could n't suppress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literally true . By God , he had served aboard His Britannic Majesty 's ships of war  --  as prize master . " Do you plan to lay long in Montego Bay ? " she demanded , eyes on canvas straining away from the main boom . " I 'll have to careen and refit there . " His expression hardened . A damned nuisance lying over . Every day ashore meant the additional risk of detection . " Damned picaroons have blown some sizeable holes through us near our waterline . Chips is clever , yet he ca n't make sure of the hurt . " He drew a slow breath , and the pipe glowing emphasized his prominent cheek bones . " God send we do n't encounterheavy weather . " On impulse he placed his hand over hers as it rested on the rail , murmured , " Mistress Minga , I  --  well  --  I guess I have n't cottoned to you much , but I 'd like to state that precious few girls I 've met possess so much charm and courage . " Her lips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half-light as she peered steadily into his deep-set black eyes . " You flatter very convincingly , Captain  --  and pleasingly . " He heard her catch her breath . Lord , how much , how poignantly , he reminded of Jerry ! He bent , kissed her hand , then strode over to check the course . On the foredeck Mr. Beetle grinned . Cap'n Warren , it appeared , was n't quite the Holy Joe he let on . Well , well ! Nor was that niceNancyof a passenger the frozen-toed pullet he 'd deemed her . Would some attention in that direction bring pleasurable results ? Eleven children , to speak of , and God knew how many others scattered from Portsmouth to Norfolk , were ample proof that girls had found reason to remember , if not to love , Jed Beetle . " When I get to Jamaica , " he decided , " I 'll get me a whole school o ' them mustee girls . By the Great Horn Spoon , I 'll have me two , mebbe three at a time  --  if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they love for nothin '  --  like in the Sandwich Islands . Hope so . Six weeks at sea is too damned long . I 'm sure fit to bust . "  |p235A  MODERATE and favoring breeze hustled the Evergreen southward . Grown more wary than ever , Captain Warren ordered his top canvas clewed up whenever the masthead reported a strange sail . To meet up with a British cruiser at this juncture was the last thing he desired . His condition inescapably would evoke queries , examinations . During two long days and nights the little brig paralleled the jagged gray-blue outline which was the horizon and the coast of Cuba . On the third day they perforce ran closer in . The island lay green , gold and blue beneath a tattered canopy of cotton-white clouds , until , in the late afternoon , the ship 's company saw lead-colored rainstormsweaving restlessly over Cape Maisi 's bold headland . On weathering the Cape , Andrew shifted course for Jamaica . They left Cuba astern . " Come two sundowns , " Andrew informed Mr. Beetle , " we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The weather remained fair . He thanked the high gods but the forward pump continued to clatter and squelch . During the night an abrupt drop showed in the glass readings , half a gale arose and kicked up a moderate sea . It was n't anything to fear ; still it was enough to rout Andrew Warren out of his bunk . When , stuffing nightshirt tails into his waistband , he came on deck a warm , wet wind filled his face with rain , then pounced on him and with playfully rough fingers , tore at his hair . The mates , he guessed , were forward making more secure the Evergreen 's deckload of lumber.  | He came wide awake with a jolt when he noted the lazy ease with which a series of combers leaped the bulwarks , came cascading over the rail . The Evergreen shouldered the water off but sluggishly . What the devil ? The brig should have risen swiftly and buoyantly . He ran aft yelling , " Put her before the wind ! " at the quartermaster . Joe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Cappen , " and ground down the wheel while Andrew himself eased the main sheet . The main top yards screeched protest in swinging to their new positions under the sudden tension and their braces hummed like harp strings . The Evergreen rode more easily as she plunged down wind . The boatswain , a blue-nosed Tory lobster potter out of East Hampton , growled , " Pump 's full o ' flour , sir . Bulkhead 's givin ' , should n't wonder . " For all her new course , the brig responded to her helm so sluggishlyAndrew felt fear lancing his stomach with an icicle . He had to bring this ship in , salt , medicines , hard money  --  all were needed so desperately by the unbreakable survivors of Valley Forge and a dozen other miserable encampments . Jerusha ! It would be a sin and a shame to win through so near to Jamaica and then fail . " Keep her as she sails , " he directed , then made his way forward through the spray-filled dark . Lord , how black it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were but indistinct blurs against the Stygian background . " Heave away on the foretop braces . " Only faintly did Mr. Tompkins ' nasal twang penetrate the dismal droning noise made by the wind in the rigging . " Why the great leaping Jonah did n't you put this craft with her injured hull before the wind ? " Tompkins ' breath reeked of rum when he bellowed . " She only ride bad a mite before you come on deck , sir . " Of course , if Mr. Tompkins had been any smarter , he 'd long since have captained a vessel of his own.  | " Where 's the carpenter ? " " Forward , sir . " Mr. Beetle appeared , grinning as if the tumultuous wind and waves were delighting him . Andrew directed his mates to furl the fore-topsail . Though the seas were nothing to fear as yet , the Evergreen 's evidentlack of buoyancy rendered him uneasy . Andrew was preparing to sound the forward well when the brig 's whole fabric shuddered and there came a noise like some gigantic branch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rending , cracklingsounds . Andrew 's first horrified reaction was that , inexplicably , the ship must have struck a reef or some derelict , but he recognized none of the grating and grinding sensations which would have accompanied such a misfortune . Slowly , so smoothly that Andrew at first was unaware of what impended , the Evergreen dipped her bowsprit into the jet black slope of a roller  --  deeper , deeper . The carpenter lurched aft , bawling , " Cap'n ! Cap'n Warren ! Where are you ? " " Here ! What 's amiss ? " " Stops in the bow 's shot holes have give way  --  hull Goddam ' Carribean'spouring into our hold . " There could be no doubt of that . Now the bow was barely clear of the water . The crew came scampering aft , their frightened voices preceding them . " Stand by to abandon ship ! Beetle ! Tompkins ! man your boats , " Andrew yelled , then turned and ran for the companionway . He collidedwith Joe Atherton . " Here 's yer log and chronometer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " The passenger . Where 's the passenger ? " Atherton nodded over his shoulder . " I pulled her out o ' bed . She 's right behind . " Ensued a frenzied period of manning the boats  --  the gig , the cutter and the whaler . Because Andrew had ordered the damaged brig 's helm put over and because her headsails still gave her a measure of steerageway , it was not too difficult to lower the small boats . True , wave tops splashed into the small boats until a foot of water set all manner of gear and floorboards to drifting about and bumping the rowers ' ankles . Faintly , the light of storm lanterns lashed into the rigging revealed water smothering the forecastle and making a hurrah'snest of the lumber and foremast rigging . The second mate 's boat got away first and pulled off into the wind without waiting to see what would happen . A falling spar punched a great hole through his cutter 's bottom , so Andrew shifted crew , passenger and all to Mr. Beetle 's gig and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Evergreen heeled lazily to starboard and did not right herself . Minga Allen , drenched and shivering in the night air , was amazed to hear a series of sibilant whistlingsand groans fill the night . Air forced up from below was rushingthrough ports and hatchways . " Pull ! Pull free ! " At the steering oar Andrew Warren was throwinghis whole weight to port . The brig 's forecastle already had disappeared under a surging flurry of spray ; next the foreshrouds began to cut at the black waters . With yards waving crazily , with canvas billowing and slatting , the brig 's stern rose . The little merchantman 's jet outline swayed and seemed to stand on her nose . Fumbling at her lucky silver bracelet Minga could only look on in numbed despair , listening to the crack of lumber and loose gear cascading the length of the deck . This could n't really be so ! Only ten minutes ago she 'd been resting peacefully , secure in her berth , relieved in the knowledge that her possessions had n't been hurt during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she 'd lost everything , even the pearls she 'd fought for , long ages ago it seemed , on the road to New York town . One after another , the brig 's cannon snapped their lashings and plunged through the sagging forecourse . " There goes my Sunday go-to-meetin ' suit , " growled Mr. Beetle tugging at an oar . " Well , always was a mite on the smallish side . "  |p239He  rowed powerfully , his great shoulders a-swing . " Damn , " he was thinking , " I 'll have to beg , borrow or steal money and a suit if ever I 'm to sample them mustee girls o ' Jamaica . " " Look ! T'old sow 's fair standing on ' er bleedin ' nose , " Joe Atherton called . The two other oarsmen who with Mr. Beetle , Andrew and the Allen girl completed the gig 's complement , turned dishevelled heads . Softly , feverishly , Andrew blasted his luck . Into the turbulent blacknessof the sea was sinking the last of Hosea Warren 's merchantmen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to mention the last shilling he himself possessed . There 'd be no hope , now , of returning to Boston , deep with Indies goods ; there 'd be no Jesuit 's bark now for those poor tattered devils of Continentals . They 'd have to continue to shake with agues and to burn with fevers . From the Evergreen came a deep rumbling . A series of eerie whistles and gigantic sighs became audible as she settled more rapidly . " Oh-h-h . " A muffled groan arose from the gig 's crew when , as if loath to disappear forever , the foundering vessel 's stern swayed briefly above the waves . All at once the black loom was n't there any more , only the empty sea  --  and wreckage . Of Mr. Tompkins and the whale boat there was no sight . Evidently , despite orders , he had pulled away into the windfilledgloom . Until this moment Andrew Warren had never known true hopelessness . When a Captain lost a command he lost with her a big part of his self-respect . He should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have foretold that a single shot could have caused so much hidden damage ? He clenched his teeth and tried to reason what could have happened . Um-m-m , the cannonball must have entered his brig 's hull on an angle , cracking or otherwise weakening several ribs besides the one it had shattered . When these injured ribs had been subjected to st rain , they 'd given way . A flirt of spindrift blinded him until , mechanically , he wiped his eyes on a dripping shirt sleeve . He 'd met skippers who 'd lost their vessels , had been tolerantly understanding of their sullen , defiant attitude . Small , accusing inner voices bellowed , shouted in his subconscious mind . " You 're a bad seaman , Andy Warren . You 're not fit for com-mand ! " He swallowed hard . This would n't have happened if he 'd avoided the Caicos Passage . Oh Lord , if only there had been a few cruisers to show the Stars and Stripes , to enforce respect for the United States in these latitudes . Still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done better  --  much better . His mind raced on in miserable haste . Of course , the Marine Committee of Congress would hear of this business and then  --  His big hand closed over the tiller handle . Would they likely give Andrew Warren an appointment ? No . Certainly not . It was obvious that a corner , a big corner , in his career had been turned ; in the wrong direction . On the rower 's bench immediately before Andrew Warren crouched Mistress Minga Allen his passenger . She sat vacant-eyed , silent , patently overwhelmed at the magnitude of the disaster . " Please , Ma'am . Will you put this on ? " He struggled out of his sodden pea-jacket , offered it to the girl . She paid not the slightest heed . He knew that she 'd barely had time to struggle half into a dress , and now she sat with one bare shoulder gleaming palely above a blanket with which she was attempting to shelter herself from the chill wind . It was pathetic to notice the elegant Mistress Allen 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What would Colonel Saunders think of his leman now ? The picture looked anything but rosy . There had n't been time to pitch more than a small supply of food , water and some navigating instruments into the gig . Well , he 'd best rouse out of this wretched inertia . The wind was still rising and now the sea thundered ominously up out of the gloom to lick over the gig 's thwarts.  | " Pick up the stroke , Mr. Beetle , " he ordered . " Atherton , you bail . Madame , you 'll have to take the tiller . Steer down wind . We 're going to try to set sail . " Minga paid no heed but sat huddled as before . " I said Take the tilled ' " She looked up , cleared her throat of the bitter taste in it . " You bungler ! Where do you find the temerity to call yourself a mariner ? " " Will you do as I say ? " he demanded . " The sail needs to be raised . We 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see you in hell first . " Her features glimmered defiantly in the half light . When he slapped her smartly she emitted a small , startled cry . " Take the tiller , you vixen  --  we 'll likely founder , else . " She hurried to comply . Hoping against hope that the canvas would prove sound , Andrew set to work . Once the leg o ' mutton sail was set , the gig commenced to answer her tiller . Mr. Beetle , Joe Atherton and a half-grown boy got busy scooping out the water ; a difficult task for lack of proper bailers . Andrew and the half-breed Penobscot occupied themselves to secure a water keg which was rolling heavily about the bottom . It was sobering to reflect that , with the gig possessing a single beaker of water , another calm would mean that , a few days hence , a company of sun-dried corpses might be found a-drifting.  |p242MINGA  ALLEN lay , not very comfortably curled on the gig 's starboard locker . Blankly she stared upward , considering more millions of stars than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how serene seemed those other worlds . " What can there be left to go wrong ? " she demanded wearily of herself . A button was digging into her ear , so , mechanically , she refolded the coat Captain Warren had insisted on placing under her head . The world tonight appeared appallingly immense , Minga Allen distressingly small and helpless . Of course , she reassured herself , her occasional sense of nausea was entirely due to the gig 's motion . Cleverly designed , the Evergreen 's small boat had run before the wind all day . Towards sundown this evening the sea had flattened enough to eliminate the necessity of continued bailing . During the past three days , the gig had shipped water all but incessantly . It came to her that , for the first time since she could remember , she felt afraid of life . Papa and Mamma , it appeared , had n't brought her up to cope with such an uncertain , informal and brutish mode of existence . But Lord above ! How could they have foreseen all this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Millwood , probably married and with a couple of babies . Babies ! She did n't dare dwell on the subject . If it had n't been for Hancock , the Adamses and their fellow rabblerousers , there 'd have been no Brunswickers in America . A fresh hatred for all Whigs pervaded her.  |p243Restless  still , Minga squirmed on the hard bench . From a corner of her eye she now could see Captain Warren 's boldly designed head and powerful shoulders . He was scanning the heavens , no doubt searching for Polaris . Andrew Warren , she had decided , could n't be called truly handsome  --  notlike Sir Jerry . Essentially , the Loyalist captain 's head was that of an alert and aggressive fighter . Quite clearly silhouetted against the sky , she discerned the slight curve of his rather long nose , the determined thrust of his chin . Take for instance their second night in the gig . When desperation and hopelessness had suddenly got the better of her she 'd blazed up to accuse him of all manner of faults . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best a wretched incompetent ! " she 'd cried . That was , of course , ridiculous , yet perversely she had gone on , " You 're not fit to command a herring boat ! " Stony-faced , he had endured her abuse quite a while before filling a bucket with sea water and flinging its contents smack into her face . " Even a good gun can get overheated , " he 'd observed . When she cooled off , Andrew Warren had found some more handsomethings to say about her behavior during the fight with the picaroons . Ever since they 'd been aboard the gig he had done everything possible for her comfort . Rough-talking , red-headed Mr. Beetle , too , was so uncommon solicitousMinga debated whether he was furthering some ulterior purpose . Mr. Beetle was very strong , and proud of it , too . Why , with his bare hands he 'd straightened the bent shank of the wrought-iron boathook . Persistently , it lingered in her mind that for Captain Warren to be supporting the King was unusual . Certainly , precious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Tory point of view  --  a fact deeply regretted by the Royal Navy . When Captain Warren shifted his gig onto the starboard tack , the locker lid dug so mercilessly into Minga 's hip that she fetched a sigh and sat up . Now she could see the rest of the company awkwardly curled up on the floor boards , snoring . How young the cabin boy looked  --  a mere child . Had the war orphaned him ? Probably , like so many others . Andrew Warren 's deep voice inquired , " Is there aught I can do for you , Ma'am ? " " No . I  --  well , I just ca n't sleep . Tonight the world seems so  --  so huge , our boat so tiny . " Curiously , she regarded him . " Do n't you ever tire ? Do n't you ever sleep ? " His teeth glimmered and the horizontal stripes of his ragged jersey rose in a shrug . " Aye , but tonight I do n't dare sleep . Should we miss the landfall of Jamaica it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't mind my conversation ? " " Mind ? Of course not . " He laughed quietly . " Only I confess I 'm astonished that you should take any pleasure in it . " Her face swung quickly in his direction and her lips , dark in the starlight , parted slowly . " Please  --  I , well , I have been unreasonable . But I 'll try not to be so any longer . " He grinned , hooked broad bare toes over her bench . " And what shall we talk about ? " " I should like to know what Jamaica is really like , " she announced , tucking her chilled and shoeless feet under her . " One sometimes hears that the climate is unhealthy ? " She wondered over the way he hesitated before replying . " Since my ship touched at Port Royal five years ago  --  only to water and to revictual  --  Iscarce rate as an authority . " " Is it indeed true that the island abounds with all manner of snakes , bats and scorpions and  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could more certainly make out her clearly chiselled features . Right now , with her hair fallen long and loose about her shoulders , she suggested a girl of sixteen rather than a young woman of maybe twenty or over . Vaguely , he conjecturedon why Minga Allen had not married long ago . She was too blamed uppity and independent , most likely . After a day 's work most men did n't relish finding an argument waiting at home . Tonight Mistress Allen had appeared really worn down . Her face was badly swollen with that combination of windburn-sunburn whichp245tormented everyone aboard the gig . Andrew knew that they had better raise Jamaica tomorrow . The food was running short and the water  --  well , the less said on that subject the better . With a pretty and well-bred young woman aboard so small a boat , life had n't been easy . When natural functions could no longer be denied , he 'd attempted to rig the sail athwart the boat , but fatigue soon had put an end to that . Quickly , all hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That Minga Allen remained such a white-hot Loyalist was a crying shame . After a long cruise a man might like to find someone like her waiting for him . Suppose he confessed that he 'd never been a King 's man  --  and that he 'd be boiled in oil before ever he became one ? What would she say were she ever to learn that Pa had died in battle against her precious King ? On the other hand , what justification could she offer that , at Brandywine , a big Hessian sergeant should have bayoneted Major Horatio Warren when he lay helpless and calling for quarter ? What might be her reactions to the fact that Cousin Gregory had perished aboard the prison ship , Jersey , of nothing else than starvation ? The gig coasted on over an endless succession of rollers , on through a clear , cool darkness lit only by flashes of phosphorescence caused by some fish scurrying away in sudden panic . Despite Mistress Allen 's present mood , he knew it would n't do a bit of good to come out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admire her courage and good sense , if she so much as uttered another syllable against the United States he knew he 'd shut her up so short she 'd never address him again . A small , sad sound returned him to the present . The girl 's head was bent , and her shoulders moved in slow irregular jerks . How small she looked , how forlorn . His free arm swept out and , in a single , powerfulgesture , he lifted her onto the sheet locker beside him . She started , stiffened , but a half-summoned rebuke remained unspoken . " It 's a big sea , ma there , " he murmured . " And the night is so very empty . "  | When her hand came groping , he took it . Jerusha ! This was the last tack he 'd ever expected to sail ! Minga rested her head against his arm and , clinging to it , began to sob softly , sadly , like a winter wind about a nor'east gable . Though immeasurably embarrassed , he had sense enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soberly watched some tears form , then fall from the end of her nose . Charles , his littlest brother , had cried just so when Caesar , his spaniel puppy , had eaten ratbane and died . When , at length , she quieted and settled against his shoulder , he did not move more than was necessary to guide the gig in her course . Warm wind currents passing over this strange girl 's body , protected by a single garment of thin cotton , rendered him aware of an indefinable , yet infinitely harmonious , aura . Odd how contact with her body was at once soothing and strongly stimulating . If only there had n't been that infernal arrogant Colonel Saunders in her background ! He must have been a very common sort to have spoilt so sweet and pleasanta girl . A strand of her hair commenced to beat against his cheek delicately , like a baby 's groping fingertips . The steady lift and sway of the gig set a sleepy rhythm . Once or twice Minga drew closer to him , eyes tight shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he must n't nod . If he missed sighting Jamaica , they 'd all die.  |p247IT  WAS Joe Beaver , the Penobscot , who first commented on a faint sour odor brought on the west wind . Andrew Warren heard him talking to Joe Atherton , whose trick it was at the tiller . " Land soon . Trees , water . " " Garn , yer blinkin ' savage , yer car n't see nothink at all , " the Englishmanwas protesting . " Too dark . " " Tomakwe not see  --  smell land , " grunted the halfbreed . He pointed his thin beak of a nose to port and sniffed audibly several times , like a ' coon dog at the foot of a hollow basswood . With the first light of dawn a small , desperately weary yellow bird appeared and commenced to circle the gig . At length the warbler settled on the gig 's stern and balanced there considering the six unkemptand bleary-eyed humans from a suspicious bright black eye . Presently , a long slate-colored streak made itself visible on a pinkishgrayhorizon . Andrew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , indeed , Jamaica . It could so readily be one of those hundreds of islands which compose the Greater Antilles . Confidence sprouted when , at sun-up , a range of jagged mountains arose , blue as any Dutchman 's breeches , above the rim of the sea . Nearer , though , glinted the flash of a sail . Joe Atherton swallowed hard and Andrew and the rest studied the stranger . Nothing to do but wait  --  the gig was as defenseless as an egg broken into a saucer . " I allow yonder 's some bulldog 's tender . Still maybe she 's a coast patroller , " Mr. Beetle muttered . " No other craft in these latitudes would show canvas white 's a schoolmarm 's thigh . "  | " Pray God she is  --  I ai n't hankerin ' to get pressed . " The boy sighed . " Yep , that 's what she is , " he burst out as a huge red ensign was broken out from the gaff of a rakish little cutter . Joe Atherton wiped sweat from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was looking as if he 'd just heard good news . No Navy officer out here , he hoped , would recognize him . Graceful as a yacht a custom 's cutter surged by , a long eightpoundermounted on her bow . Not a hundred yards astern she came about ; the gig 's company could distinguish a row of sable heads grinningbehind her rail . Occupying the patrol cutter 's cockpit were two mulattos and a long yellow-faced European wearing a uniform coat which , flapping open , exposed a bony , hairy chest . After surrendering the tiller to one of the mulattos , the white man stood up to survey the gig . " Boat ahoy ! " he hailed through cupped hands . " What do you here ? " " Castaways from the Evergreen , brig , out of New York , " Andrew yelled . " Can you take us in tow ? " " You 'll damn well row over here and come aboard , " bellowed the Englishman . " Do n't like the look of you ! " Once the gig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sallow features . The low-lying early morning sun was striking through Mistress Allen 's faded cotton gown . Effectively , it cast her body into silhouette and betrayed that not even a single petticoat protected her long slim legs . The officer , a lieutenant , so the single tarnished epaulet drooping over his left shoulder ranked him , began to do up his tunic buttons . " Lieutenant Pollack , Madam , of his Majesty 's Customs Service , " he mumbled . " Yours to command , Madam . " Minga summoned a wan smile at the awkwardness with which the gaunt individual bowed over her reddened , grimy paw of a hand . " This is Mistress Allen , " Andrew explained with dignity . " She is a niece of Sir Thomas Moffat . " " Eh ? " The speaker 's pale eyes narrowed . " Did you say the name was Moffat ? "  | " Why yes . " Minga looked sharply at him . " Is there anything odd in that ? " " Why no , Madam , " mumbled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grinning . " I fancy not . Indeed not . Were you aware that Sir Thomas , ahem  --  departed this life last year ? " Minga nodded . " So I heard . " " Indeed , so , Ma'am . Of the putrid fever . " She hesitated . " Does his wife  --  Mrs. Moffat  --  still  --  " Lieutenant Pollack looked aside . " Oh , yes , Ma'am , Mrs. Moffat remains on the estate and , if I 'm well informed , she will never leave it . " " Where is the estate ? " Minga demanded , making desperate attempts to keep her sea-stained skirts from blowing . The customs officer passed a hand over a chin dark from lack of shaving ; his dirty fingers quivered incessantly . " Why , Moffat 's Penn is quite remotely situated , near six miles up the Montego River . A rich property , Ma'am , that is , it was , until Sir Thomas died  --  and  --  and  --  well , until rebellion was raised in America . " Wary as seldom before , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wholly unnecessary vigilance with which he superintendedthe cutter 's black crew , the unstepping of the gig 's mast , and in other preparations for taking her in . For all that , and as untidy as he was , the customs officer maintained strict discipline aboard his tiny command . The skinny-legged Negroes of his crew executed their duties with dispatch . All of them went naked save for patched seersucker pantaloons and ragged-edged hats fashioned of rushes . When Minga came clambering aboard , the crew uncovered , but stared in ivory-eyed wonder on the copper complexioned Penobscot , who boarded the cutter with dignity and a certain grace . Swaying on legs thin as pipe stems , the Englishman turned , bent over a little companionway . " Cupid ! I say , Cupid ! " he roared . " Rouse that lazy black butt of yours . Fetch me up biscuits and Madeira ! " He turned to Minga.  | " Meantime , Madam , I fancy you might wish to go below . You 'll discover towels , fresh water and soap . " Aware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officer 's obvious admiration , Minga accepted and became lost to sight . Andrew felt it proper to say , " Mr. Pollack , this is Mr. Beetle , my first officer . " " God no ! Beetle ? Ca n't be ! " The Englishman burst into a series of crackling laughs . " ' Pon my word when you fetch a beetle to Jamaica , you fetch coals to Newcastle ! Beetle ! A beetle to Jamaica ! Blast me if this ai n't rich ! " Scarlet to his brows , the mate surged to his feet , fixed the customs officer with a baleful eye . " Mister Pollock , a feller who 's called after a no-count trash fish had n't orter make free with names . " The Englishman glared . " Keep a civil tongue in your ugly head ! " Tory or not , Mr. Beetle gathered himself . " One more crack and I 'll drive a handful of teeth down yer gullet . " " Silence , you damned insolent dog ! " Andrew barely blocked his mate 's lusty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a fine way to reach Jamaica ! " Drop it ! " he ordered , though he did n't blame Beetle a bit . " Drop nothin ' ! " snarled the mate . " Lemme loose , Cap'n , I 'll teachthat lemon-complected bastard to fun over my name ! " " Sit down ! " Lieutenant Pollack 's hand had crept to the pocket of his tunic . Mr. Beetle never saw it , yet there was a quality to Andrew 's command which exacted obedience . " Should have known that no common Colonial could be expected to possess a sense of humor , " mumbled the customs officer . There again was that infernal , patronizing manner . Inwardly , AndrewWarren seethed , yet was proud of having actually hung onto his temper . Patronage emanated convincingly from this obscure and distinctly malodorous officer of the Crown . Joe Atherton , too the big mate con/tinued to glower and mutter under his breath , Andrew begged a measure of sweet oil and sent him forward to dress his crew 's more serious sunburns . He turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a grim twist to his lips . " Pray , make allowance , sir , " Andrew urged , " that for five days we have been adrift in an open boat . " The Englishman nodded slowly . " It 's a racking business ; was adrift myself once  --  three weeks in the Bight of Benin . Should n't have twitted your mate on his name and that 's a fact . Still  --  " The customs officer 's eye sought the distant shore . " Your mate talks uncommon like a Yankee  --  and so do you . " " Mr. Beetle is from Long Island and is no more a Rebel than you  --  or I , " he had the wit to add . Jerusha ! He did n't like this Englishman'sair . " You 'll have preserved your ship 's papers ? " Lieutenant Pollack inquired crisply . " There was no time . My brig went down like a stone . " " She must have , " came the guarded comment . " Well , Cupid , what is it ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Negro in glaring yellow came swaying aft , big bare feet softly slapping the deck . " Shall Ah cool dat wine wid sal'petre ? " " No , you confounded idiot , just wrap it in the cooling towel , and be quick about it . " In the meanwhile "  --  Lieutenant Pollack delved into a locker and produced a black bottle and poured two tots of rum into well polished half coconut shells . " There 's no denying that Madeira 's a capital tipple , " quoth the customs officer , wiping his forehead with the free end of a bandanna knotted about his neck , " yet for a long cruise , give me straight Jamaica  --  To your health , Captain , and the mending of your fortune . " " To your health , Mr. Pollack , and to his Majesty 's Customs Serv-iceTheytouched dark brown and cleverly carved shells . To Andrew ,  | the amber liquid tasted fine as silk . Nom de Dieu ! It was French rum out of Martinique and it stirred blood slowed by prolonged inaction . Best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alive . This **28;7510;TOOLONG was nobody 's fool . Andrew found it difficult to imagine what might be going on behind the Englishman 's haggard , sweat-brightened face . Lieutenant Pollack put down his helm and , catching a favoring blast of wind , commenced to run westward along a coast lined by tall hills rising boldly from warm fringes of beach , interspersed with swampy entrances where mangroves , plantains and other tropical plants ran riot . Now and again the palm-thatched roofs of fishermen 's huts arose , yellow-brown under the bluish shadows cast by the ragged leaves of coconut palms . Along the beaches canoes , skiffs and tiny little sloops , designed for the capture of turtles , sponges and fish , were drawn up above the water 's edge . Very occasionally the outline of some great white house glimmered amid a checkerboard pattern of fields , against lush , blue-green vegetation . Below , Minga Allen interrupted her ablutions to turn a glistening , sun-reddened face to a nearby port-hole . Yonder lay Jamaica ! A sharp excitement invaded her , set her pulses to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sugar Islands , and by far the most valuable of England 's rich West Indian possessions . Since childhood the word " Jamaica " had aroused in her a lively curiosity . From thence came the sugar , the coffee , the pimentoes , the occasional oranges , lemons and coconuts which once had graced Judge Allen 's dinner table . She 'd heard seafarers and ship owners like Obadiah Wright of Norwich and Captain John Cook , Papa 's great friend , describe a savage black Jamaican race called Maroons . Many a Colonial esquire had founded and increased his fortunes in the Jamaica or triangle trade : Jamaica , New England and Africa . Even as a young girl Minga had explored certain docks along the Eastern River in New York . Whenever a Jamaica ship was in she could recognize it by the sickish-sweet , queer , foreign smell it gaveoff.  |p253Often  she would tell herself , " just think , that ship has seen palm trees , green water and coral reefs . " Generally half-naked , wild-eyed black men , wearing gyves , were discharging those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the strange social usages , terrible plagues and bloodthirsty repression of uprisings among slaves fresh from steamy jungles of the Ivory Coast . Well , mighty soon now she 'd see for herself . Suddenly she started doubting . Would Aunt Adelina welcome , not the semi-heiress she had invited to visit Moffat 's Penn , but a penniless , friendless orphan  --  who was , it seemed , doomed to bear a bastard child ? Resolutely , she returned to her efforts to render herself more presentable . When she returned to the deck , Lieutenant Pollack was drawling with a coconut shell poised before his lips . " Sighted a boat like yours last week . Three people in it  --  poor beggars were withered , sun-dried like so many cod-fish on a rack . They never stood a chance of mak-i no. land . " " No chance ? Why ? " Lieutenant Pollack emitted a short , high-pitched cackle of a laugh . " Some picaroons had gouged their eyes out before setting ' em adrift . The whiskeradoes have grown confounded bold of late . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flattened slowly as he arose . Cupid , Pollack 's enormous Negro steward , passed , in rapid succession , biscuits , Madeira , star apples , avocados , oranges and even a cold joint of what the cutter 's commander referred to as " Jew 's mutton . " Forward , Atherton , the boy and the seamen were noisily consumingackee and salt fish . " What in the world is Jew 's mutton ' ? " Minga demanded . " Da 's goat , Maum , " beamed Cupid , waddling about . " For true . Bery young goat . " I n the shade of the mainsail , Mr. Beetle and Joe Beaver silently , Inn liberally , helped themselves from calabashes of vegetables and cold meat . " This has been a beastly spring , " Pollack observed , and steadiedc tiller with his knee while employing a tobacco-stained fingernailto dislodge a bit of meat from his teeth . " Up-country estates are be- coming deuced hard-hit for supplies . " He grinned bleakly . " But from America the planters manage to smuggle in enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Starving ! " Minga glanced incredulously at the softly green coast slipping so smoothly by . " Why , I ca n't imagine anyone going hungry in Jamaica . It looks like Paradise over there . " Pollack nodded . " No need to starve , true enough . The planters here have only their own beastly greed to thank for this hunger . Ever since we took over this blasted , plague-ridden island , the Crown has been begging the overseers and attorneys to plant food crops . But the beggars wo n't do it  --  every time they 'll plant every last square yard with sugar and import food . " " But why ? " Minga demanded . " Surely it means only a few guineas more of profit . " " Aye , but it 's a profit for owners in England and more commission for their attorneys . " From his pocket , the customs officer produced a yellow bandana which he knotted methodically about a narrow , nearly hairless head . The steadily increasing heat had begun to start sweat trickling down his cheeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tricorn adorned with a limp yellow cockade and braid of tarnished silver . " Make no mistake about it , " he resumed , " the blacks are really starving up in the hill estates . Heard it first-hand that Las Cruces Penn has lost nigh over three hundred niggers . Ought to send you up there , Cupid , eh what ? " A band of little scars running across the steward 's forehead wrinkled . " No , sar . Cupid he need stay by de sea . " He broke into a nervous cackle and waddled off , enormous buttocks quivering like jelly . " He 'd better , at that . " Pollack winked at Andrew , lowering his voice . " Cupid 's a man of parts make no mistake . He 's got brats strewed along the coast from Rio Bueno to Bloody Bay . " As the Calypso , cutter , sailed along , perhaps half a mile off shore , all manner of sea birds glided by  --  gulls , terns , kestrels and greatp255numbers of lumbering gray pelicans . These last coasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surface . Occasionally the cutter overhauled black slaves working traps . They worked from dug-out canoes equipped with clumsy outriggers . Sometimesthey 'd only stare sullenly at the trim green and white craft underits huge Red Ensign , but more often they would give halloo and wave strips of blue cloth , or hold up fishes bright as animate rainbows . Generally their cries were quite unintelligible . " Ooray busha ! Gibnyam f " " What tribes are they from ? " Andrew queried . " Do n't recognize their lingo . " " Guinea birds for the most part , " Pollack told him . " Eboes or Mandingos . They make prime haulers and fishermen . " Occasional strips of road became visible and at more frequent intervalsone could see brown nets drying , small luggers , sloops and canoes at anchor in the incredibly clear blue-green water of a tiny basin . " Must be evergreens up on those mountains , " Andrew mused . Even as he studied them , clawing at the sky , a billow of woolly clouds came tumbling over the rim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table , commenced to cascade down the mountain side . " Once we 've weathered yonder point , " Lieutenant Pollack announcedover the steady swish-swishing of the waves , " we 'll be into Montego Bay . " At the Englishman 's mention of the port , Andrew 's brown features contracted . Well , certainly he 'd never figured on making Montego Bay like this ! No money , no cargo , no ship . Somewhere back up there must lie Senor Cardozo 's compound  --  and those drugs and medicines and surgical instruments Dr. Blanchard and his fellows had pled for so fervently . He felt especially low because it was Uncle Hosea 's last ship he 'd lost ; the Evergreen also had been the first of the family ships he 'd been given to command . Watching the sparkling rush of rollers over a half-submerged reef , he wondered how in Tunket he was going to get back to America . Before long the Trumbull frigate would at last be ready to go to sea ?  | Damnation ! This would be no quick turn-around trip . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as prize master over three of His Britannic Majesty 's men-of-war it would go hard . He 'd best look sharp . Some of his former prisoners might have been exchanged . He shot a sidewise glance at Minga . Now that her chestnut hair had been combed into some pretense of order and she had mended , with a sailmaker 's needle , various rips and tears in her gown , she appeared almost well-groomed . He looked at her more attentively , perceived , for the first time , how very gracefully her neck sloped into shoulders which were at once well made , yet capable-looking . How could such a girl ever have become the protegee of such a crusty old codger as Colonel Saunders ? Well , ashore he 'd try to find out . Probably she was all-aflame under that composed exterior . It was n't , he 'd found out , the girls who talked with bed springs in their voices or wore provocatively revealing gowns , who were the best fun for a bright moment in a dark corner . No , Lautrec had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressions and downcast eyes who really made it worthwhile to make port . Gradually , Montego Bay , principal port on the northern coast of Jamaica , came into view around a small headland . A double tier of white , yellow and brown houses disclosed themselves ; some unimportant-appearing wharfs and warehouses were grouped in disorderabout a semi-circular bay . Minga Allen 's bright under lip tucked itself between her teeth and her chin quivered just a little . Her eyes were sparkling , however , and if she were experiencing qualms of uncertainty over the future , they manifested themselves not at all . " So , Captain Warren , we make port ? " The subdued excitement in her tone was inescapable . He guessed the reason . He must have felt like that long years ago when , on his first voyage , he 'd watched the coast of Brittany begin to move up out of the sea . " What a queer  --  what a very pretty harbor ! " she murmured . A surprising number of merchantmen lay at anchor . Quite a few vessels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ docks , but for all that , the port wore a lifeless , sun-dried and definitely down-at/the-heel aspect . On a slimy brown-gray mud bank off to port a numberof storm- or battle-broken hulks lay rotting , their gaunt ribs a perch for sea birds . Promptly , Andrew located the inevitable guardian fort ; it proved a small , white-washed battery crowning a hill behind the port . A Union Jack hung lifeless from a flagpole beyond it . Mr. Beetle 's expectant grin was fading . God A'mighty ! There was n't a soul a-stirring , let alone a pretty mustee . Still  --  maybe when the sun lowered there 'd be some fun show up ? Money ? He 'd provoke some bully of the garrison into a prize fight . For all he held to his loyalty , he enjoyed hammering an Englishman whenever the opportunityoffered . Under Lieutenant Pollack 's sure piloting through a baffling series of mangrove-covered flats , the cutter shaped a course towards a wharf which betrayed Admiralty design . Spoiled fruit , bits of rind , rubbish and other refuse , drifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shut off by a range of high hills . " Heavens ! Where is everybody ? " Minga demanded . " Is there a plague loose ? " " Pray God not ! " Pollack burst out . " There 's been no yellow jack around for months . " The almost incredible stillness was accentuated by the sound of hammering . It came from aboard a round-bowed brig showing Dutch colors . Two of the vessels in port captured and held Andrew 's attention . First , a large schooner of nearly two hundred tons . A number of fresh yellow shot holes in her black-painted sides marred the smooth sweep of her lines . Her foremast , moreover , was heavily fished and a whole section of her bulwarks had been carried away . Long before he made out the name , Enterprise , Middletown Connecticut , painted across her stern , he guessed the schooner 's status . Further on lay the other captive vessel , the Ranger of Norwich . Sheust have been brought into port quite recently , for from her signal aiI hung a depressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flag and , flapping listlessly above it , the Union jack.  |p258WITH  the already sodden end of his yellow bandana Lieutenant Pollackwiped a heavy beading of sweat from faintly greenish features . " You 'd best reserve your report concerning the picaroons for the H.M.S. Squirrel 's officers , " he told Andrew . " She 's duty ship on this station and expected in tonight . And now you 'll go ashore . I 've my patrol to complete . God blast the traitorous merchants smuggling along this coast ! In league with the Yankees , some of ' em  --  or might as well be . Shake a leg there ! " Irritably , the customs officer considered Mr. Beetle as , quite deliberately , he climbed up to the stone wharf . " Thank you , Mr. Pollack , " Minga said . " You have been rarely kind . " " Aye , we 're deeply in your debt , sir , " Andrew said , offering his hand . The customs officer took it , wrung it listlessly . Blinking , barefoot , and hatless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching the cutter 's lackadaisical black seamen thread the gig 's painter through a ring-bolt let into the Admiralty wharf 's slimy stone work . For the first time in many years , Andrew Warren became aware of a sense of helpless confusion . This was enemy territory , he had n't a penny , only a friendless girl on his hands . He braced a foot on the greasy coping of the government wharf and bent to address the Englishmanstanding hot and impatient in the cutter 's cockpit . " What do you suggest we had best do ? Right away , that is . " " Do ? Do ? Damme , sir , that is for you to determine . I 've done my duty . "  |p259A  shower of sweat drops sketched circles on the cockpit floor when Pollack wheeled and roared , " Hi , you Jug ! You , Punch ! You , Jupiter ! Cast off , you lazy black bastards , and act alive else I 'll see your backsidessmoke under a flopper . " Mr. Beetle glowered , observed , " Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to size . " Atherton grinned broadly , looked relieved to see that tarnished uniform further away . Joe Beaver stood blinking , his vitreous black eyes probing the row of patched and mud-spattered plaster houses beyond the wharf 's end . The boy absently rubbed oil over his scarlet sunburns . When Lieutenant Pollack put over his helm , two Negroes jibed over the cutter 's boom . Her enormous Union Jack stirring lazily , the green and white cutter gathered way . Lieutenant Pollack did not even glance astern , only settled back in the stern sheets and drank thirstily from a coconut , the top of which Cupid had removed with an expert slash from a heavy-bladed machete . " He  --  our rescuer  --  is not over-gallant , " murmured Minga . " Liver 's bad , I expect , " Andrew hazarded . " Too much rum and salt beef . " Aware of an expectant manner among his companions , Andrew said , " Well , we 'd best get out of the sun , " and led to a shed beneath which Naval stores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his chin . " I scarce know what to advise , " he confessed with a small shrug . " Had n't we best fend for ourselves ? " Mr. Beetle demanded and rolled his eyes towards some taverns lining the far side of a sun-lashed square . Yonder a bright green petticoat had flashed briefly at one of the doorways . The square opposite Admiralty Dock was n't much , fringed by discouraged-looking palms and adorned by a very ugly statue raised to some obscure celebrity . " We could meet here tonight  --  no , say tomorrow morning . " " Ai n't no call to worry , sir . We 'll not remain stranded long . Crews die off quicker'n usual in these latitudes . "  |p26oAtherton  gathered a straw between calloused toes , exposed several gold teeth in a taut grin . " Yes . Let us separate . I do n't figure to be around when that bulldog makes port  --  she 'll be ' untin " ands , she will . They all does . " This made sense . Nothing was to be gained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the history of one AndrewWarren . It was agreed , then , to meet on Admiralty wharf at six  --  in the cool of the morning . " Keep that temper of yours below hatches , " Andrew warned the mate . " Speak out of turn around here , they 'll clap you in jail and throw away the key . " " Right you are , sir , " Mr. Beetle winked , then more soberly he added , " I sure admired your innards , Ma'am , that day we stood off the whiskeradoes . " A flush leaped into Minga 's cheeks . " Why  --  why thank you , Mr. Beetle . I  --  we 'll see you tomorrow . " " Aye , that you will , Ma'am , barrin ' acts of God  --  " "  --  Or of the Devil , " Andrew corrected . On impulse Mr. Beetle asked , " Want to come along , Bub ? " The boy beamed . " Oh , yes , sir . " In company they swung off past a heap of six pound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Beaver ? " The Penobscot 's jet eyes sought a row of tall green hills rising beyond the port . He hardly moved his lips in saying , " Tomakwe need woods  --  be lonesome . Three days Tomakwe come back . " The Indian strode lightly on bandy , thin-shanked legs . When he re-entered the sunlight , his long hair glistened like a crow 's wing . The sleek dull copper of his skin glowed through a wide tear in his faded blue cotton shirt . Atherton knuckled his forehead and strode off looking carefully to his left and right . Alone , Andrew and his companion surveyed each other soberly . Right now , Minga Allen looked surprisingly small and bedraggled  --  rather like a lost kitten . She had plaited her hair into two long braidsp261and secured them , crown-like , about her head . Because she wore no stays , only a single sea-stained gown , the outlines of high , welldevelopedbreasts , of a gently rounded stomach and straight legs were frankly revealed . For her part , Minga saw an intense , dark-skinned fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mane of hair which should have been clubbed between his shoulders with ribbon . Certainly he was well and powerfully set up  --  reminiscent of Mr. Beetle , but on a smaller scale . His blue-and-white striped jersey revealedwide bands of muscle rippling across his shoulders , down . nearly hairless arms . His white canvas knee breeches had become se dirtied and stained their original color would be hard to guess . His eyes were tired , hollowed by sleeplessness and long exposure to the sun 's pitiless intensity . Putting hands on hips , Andrew smiled through sun-cracked lips . " D' you suppose , Minga , my dear , that two more destitute persons have ever set foot on Jamaica ? " " Oh , yes . We , at least , are free . " She laughed , though the knowledge that they had n't a farthing between them was n't a bit amusing . " Free to starve unless you can find us fruit . " Momentarily , Andrew knit heavy brows . " I think we shall look up a Mr. Allerdice . " " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  still is , I hope . Before this war my uncle pursued a great commerce with Winde &; Allerdice . " It was sheer torture again to emerge into the pounding sunlight . Minga bit her lip and curled her toes away from the searing heat of the street . This was indeed an unfamiliar world . Not one thing was suggestive of home , neither houses nor shops ; trees and plants all were strange . Even the air smelt foreign . Scarcely a soul was abroad . Ragged Negroes dozed under a line of enormous two-wheeled wains . In the shade of an upturned small boat , some dirty , wan-looking white children were sucking at short lengths of sugar cane . Uncertainly , Andrew descended the water front , picking an erratic course to avoid the droppings of oxen , mules and other creatures . Before long he sighted a substantial two-storey stone warehouse bearing , in faded brown letters , the legend : WINDE , ALLERDICE &; CO . Dealers in Sugar , LumberGrain , Livestock &; American Goods . Within the warehouse someone could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When a ' aloud the wind doth blowAnd coughing drowns the parson 's saw , And birds sit brooding i ' the snowAnd Marian 's nose looks red and raw , When roasted crabs hiss in the bowl , Then nightly sings the staring owl . " Andrew and his companion halted before a warehouse which had seen better days . No paint protected ponderous iron bars on the structure'sglassless windows , and in great flakes pale blue whitewash applied to its facade was peeling into weeds withering at the roadside . Nearly all of its clumsy , iron-bound shutters were warped or broken ; some of them hung crookedly from their hinges . Andrew 's knock reverberated hollowly and , though the discordant singing continued , it evoked no response . In perplexed silence the unkempt couple regarded each other . Andrew passed a hand over a jaw black with a week 's beard . " Well , I 'm damned . You wait here . " Repeatedly calling the agent 's name , the New Englander stepped boldly into a counting room the air of which was heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invoices , manifests , inventoriesand shipping forms of many sorts to drift far and wide over the dusty floor . Heavy greenish mould had gathered on the calfskin covers of a series of ledgers ; letter books had been stacked helterskelteron a chest of a sort in which tea samples were customarily kept . The only evidence of life was a scrawny cat suckling a litter of kittens on a wicker armchair 's sagging seat ; prolonged feline occupancyof the room was pungently unmistakable.  |p263This  disorder came as an infinitely disturbing surprise . Uncle Hosea had pictured Mr. Allerdice as an uncommonly neat and industrious Scotsman . " Death is now the phoenix nest ; And the turtle 's loyal breast To Eternity doth rest . " Following the sound of the song , Andrew lifted the latch of a ponderousdoor , halted on the threshold of a huge room . It was hard at first to see much in this dim gloom . While he waited for his eyes to adjust themselves after the intense sunlight , nearby some rats squeaked and scuttled about . Gradually he became aware of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were emitting a faintly nauseous smell ; beyond them hundreds on hundreds of hogsheads of sugar and molasses climbed in layers towards the roofbeams . Upon them perched quantities of shrill-voiced sparrows . Arrogantly sure of their domain , rats by the dozens galloped unconcernedly about the dingy masses of spoilt sailcloth , chests of china , boxes of hardware , and over padlocked trunks of Manchester goods . From a stock , Andrew selected an axehandle , swung it to ward off the swarming rodents . " To this urn let those refrain That are either true or fair ; For these dead birds sigh a prayer . " The song emanated from beyond a small door to his left so he rapped sharply with the axehandle , at the same time called , " Mr. Allerdice ? " The singer broke off , hiccoughed and must have broken something were one to judge by a resounding crash . A dog growled , sniffed at the door . " Ye waste yer time , I war-r-n ye , whoever ye are ! " quavered an elderly voice . " I havena @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Melhado , Silveira and Company ye must deal with the noo . " " Mr. Allerdice ! This is Andrew Warren . "  | " What fulishness is this ? Go awa ' , ye bloodsuckers , " railed the thin voice beyond the door . " Get ye gone lest I loose this fearsome beastie . " Andrew began to get his dander up . Blast this drunken sot ! Sharply he rapped . " Open up , and be quick about it . I 'm from Warren &; Whitney of Boston and Portsmouth , New Hampshire . " " Warren and Whit  --  Nay , it canna be ! Get ye hence and the Laird 's curse lie heavy on ye for making mock o ' a puir , unhappy old anon . " " I 'm not mocking you . " The New Englander beat down a sudden Aare of resentment . What a time to have to put one 's trust in a rumsoakedold toss-pot . It took quite a tuck in Andrew 's pride to call , " Mr. Allerdice , I  --  need your help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! and then the door creaked back to disclose a gnome-like figure swaying in the midst of what looked like a sort of kitchen-dining room . A three days ' beard bristled below bleared blue eyes and above a filthy , food-stained shirt . The messy little old man was hugging a dark green bottle in the crook of his left elbow . Fighting down his repulsion , Andrew inquired , " You are Mr. Allerdice ? " - Unsteadily the merchant 's rheumy eyes considered this tall young man who so nearly filled the doorway , from dusty bare feet to shock of jet hair brushing the lintel . The old man blinked , rubbed one eye with a dirty knuckle . " Aye . I 'm a ' that remains mortal o ' Jamie Allerdice . " And I 'm Hosea Warren 's nephew . " ' Oh , aye , " he cackled . " Ye 'll be one o ' the Warrens , sure enough . They 're black as auld Clootie 's bottom  --  all o ' them . " ! Belly jiggling loosely under a shirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backwards . " Come in , Mister Warren , and be welcome tae this abode o ' prosperity an ' merriment ! " When Mr. Allerdice 's wrinkled hand waved his guest into the room , a tired old brown dog lifted his lip at him and growled beforep265retiring beneath a cot . The sheets on it must have been there a long , long time . Andrew wavered , undecided as to the wisest course . The thought of leaving Minga in her embarrassingly scant costume waiting by the warehouse entrance was n't attractive , still , it was no more fitting to present her to this decayed old reprobate . Yet , this rum-soaked dotard represented his one real connection in Jamaica with  --  well , with that secure , orderly past which seemed to have departed forever . Batting eyes which shone red as brandied cherries , the Scot peered upwards . " So yell be Hosea Warren 's son ? " In weary patience Andrew corrected him . " No , Mr. Allerdice , I 'm his nephew . Horatio Warren was my Pa . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so ! " He considered his sunburnt guest 's apparent destitute condition a long moment , puzzled , but gave up his effort to understand . " ' T is in a vexsome state ye find me , lad . As in the song , the wur-rld here is turned upside down . " He held out the bottle , giggling . " Pour yersel ' a wee noggin o ' this . ' T is no sae bad . Ne'er tried a drop till ' 76 . ' T was then Mr. Winde and I lost first the Anabelle , then the Tartar and finally our Huntress tae the Yankees . " While Andrew poured out a modest measure , Allerdice smiled an uncertain smile which , somehow , was touching ; in it Andrew could glimpse the keen , upright man who must once have been James Allerdice. " in honor o ' the occasion , Captain , I 'd gladly offer ye Madeira an I possessed a single drap . " Scrawny shoulders sagged and the old man 's clouded eyes wavered . " Wi ' all shame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a beggar ye find . " " A beggar ? What ? Why that  --  that 's impossible . " " Aye , a beggar . Poor as Christian charity tae a Mahometan ! " " But I saw your warehouse fairly choked , bursting with goods ! " " Foreclosed , lad , a ' foreclosed I 've been . " He sank suddenly onto a stool . " ' T is mine no more . Melhado , the Jew out of Kingston , will own it come Eastertide . But  --  " The bent shoulders squared a little and James Allerdice looked Andrew square in the eye , " but I paid my firm 's creditors , mark ye , paid ' em off to the last bitter penny and none can say James Allerdice is no ' an honest mon . Aye , I paid off twelve pence tae the shilling  --  and wrecked a traffic Johnny Winde and me were twenty year a-building . " " Uncle Hosea set a deal by you , Mr. Allerdice , and your honesty . " " Did he , lad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straightened . " Ye 're a good mon to tell me that . It  --  it helps . Though often it has cost us dear , Winde &; Allerdice hae been good o ' their pledged wur-rd . " Never , Andrew thought , would he forget those words . Let who would lie and cheat , but not one of his people ! " What did ye say yer given name is ? " " Andrew . " " Andrew ? Losh , lad , yon 's a braw Scottish name . " The old merchant , Andrew sensed , was exerting efforts to pull himself together . Poor devil ! He felt an immense pity . He guessed something of what Allerdice was suffering . He , too , had failed . Andrew recalled now that night after the Evergreen had foundered , he 'd have sold his right arm for a demijohn of rum . Allerdice swayed to a curtain fashioned of jointed bamboo and bellowed , " Clorinda ! Luk i ' the food locker , see if there 's aught there fit to set before a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Andrew almost added . There was no leaving Minga alone any longer . Then he remembered . He needed to learn , to glean local news , and he could n't with such a determined Loyalist as Minga in hearing . In grim amusement he saw that she would have to suffer for her precious King yet again . " Here . " Mr. Allerdice spoke in almost desperate haste , thrusting forward a calabash cup . Into it he splashed a quantity of dark red rum . " Drink , lad , and remember , the higher we fly our kites o ' ambition why , ' t is the farther they ha'e to fall . " In depressing eagerness he gulped his drink and made a clackin noise . " So yer Horatio 's son ? He was an Army man , an I dinna mistakemeself . " Andrew explained that Pa had served in the King 's Army despitep267the slights a Colonial officer had to swallow  --  up till the fall of ' 74 . Pa , Andrew elaborated , had fought in seven pitched battles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finger at the intaking of Louisburg . Again he had near perished of yellow-jack during Admiral Vernon 's ill-starred venture against Cartagena . Mr. Allerdice tugged at a wisp of his greasy gray hair . " Yer feyther 's well ? " " No  --  he was killed at the battle of Brandywine  --  damned German ran him through as he lay wounded . " Briefly , he elaborated on the family 's recent ill fortune  --  Mother dead a month after Pa , Uncle Hosea a bankrupt though he did n't yet know it  --  and Uncle Isaac a Loyalist . Even now he was thought to be cruising the New England coast , captaining H.M.S. Scarsboroughg 32 guns . Bedraggled old Allerdice cast him a sympathetic look , went over to a jar cooler  --  an affair of porous stone arranged in a wooden frame  --  and laced his drink with water . " Yell not be disposed tae judge me too harshly ? Winde &; Allerdice wasna ' always like this . Time was when I 'd me own polink up in the cool mountains and as fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd e'en a wee bit o ' pleasure boat . " The faded craggy features tightened . " Oh , the havoc wrought by yon stubborn , stupid Hanoverian and his hell-bound ministers ! E'en a Stuart couldna ' be so purblind . " Cautiously , Andrew suggested , " Then His Majesty is not uniformly popular here ? " The Scot glanced mechanically over his shoulder , narrowed bloodshot eyes . " Till last year there were precious few o ' us who 'd not have tossed our cups tae see the German lout roast i ' the nethermost Pit ! " " Till last year ? " Andrew was puzzled . " Now near a ' the Jamaica merchants despair o ' a Yankee victory . " The old man muttered , his lips close to the New Englander 's ear . " We 've a ' lost vessels tae Yankee letters-o ' - marque . " Mr. Allerdice nodded heavily and the old dog looked up , growled deep in his throat . " When the Yankee private ships o ' war crippled our trade wi ' England , most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned againstp268the Colonies . " Mr. Allerdice rubbed a ruddy button of a nose , looked up quickly . It was clear something had occurred to him . " Captain  --  ? " " Well ? " " Ye spoke the now o ' yer Uncle Isaac as a King 's man . Then o ' yer feyther , dead for the Yankee cause . " He leaned forward , his breath rank in Andrew 's face . " That offers a choice . Are ye  --  ? " The decision was inevitable , critical  --  give the wrong answer and disaster would pounce in short order . To give himself time to think , he raised the red-brown rum to his mouth . " I 'm Loyal , Mr. Allerdice , " then added slowly , " just as loyal as you are . " That ought to give the old man pause . He was surprised at having sensed the right answer . Or was it right ? Mr. Allerdice muttered under his breath and drank deep . " E'en now many here hold for the King  --  body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Why , yer Admiralty people , the garrison , the pensioners , the Clergy , the Crown servants and most of all , the Jews . " " The Jews ? " This was indeed a surprise . " Aye , lad , the Jews . " In the stale sunlight Mr. Allerdice 's shaggy head inclined in drunken gravity . " Oh , come now  --  " James Allerdice flared right up . " Dinna question my wurrd , Andrew Warren , not till ye , see what shamefu ' prices the Hebrews offerus distressed merchants who must sell out to pay our honest debts . I 'm no sayin ' some o ' the factors here ai n't reaping fortunes . " " But you are a factor yourself ? " " We were , " Mr. Allerdice corrected bitterly . " ' T was our misfortuneour trade was wi ' North America  --  not England . " " Can not you merchants band together ? As we  --  as in New England ? " " We dare n't , " explained Mr. Allerdice , his shoulders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jamaica since Sir Basilp269Keith perished i ' June o ' the last year  --  has posted rewards for information'gainst Yankee sympathizers . " Still  --  " Mr. Allerdice winked . " Many 's the stand o ' muskets , sack o ' doubloons and cask o ' gunpowder has been shipped north ' twixt Negril Point and Manchioneal . " " If ever the New Englanders get a fleet to sea , much more will be smuggled from this island . " Get a fleet to sea ? Aye , there it was again . As he stood in Mr. Allerdice 's hot , musty-smelling quarters bitterness boiled within Andrew Warren . Thanks to a deal of pettiness , penny-pinching , backbitingand self-seeking in Philadelphia and Boston , there was n't much likelihood of the new Confederation 's ever getting even a decent-sized fleet to sea . The British could land along the Atlantic Coast almost at will . Could Mr. Allerdice be trusted ? Andrew wondered . The Scots in the Carolinas had proved loyal to the Crown to an astonishing degree . It was impossible to keep Minga waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Evergreen 's loss , Andrew mentioned her presence and suggested that he fetch in the Allen girl . The old merchant shook his head . " ' We 'll go greet the lass i ' the  --  the office . "  |p270MR  . JAMES ALLERDICE roused himself , even made an effort to button the loose linen waistcoat he wore as he and Andrew neared the office . Minga Allen had entered , was playing with one of the kittens . When she beheld Andrew 's bent and unkempt companion , her clear gray-green eyes opened wide . The Jamaican bowed so low his head was at a level with her waist . " Yer most humble obedient servant , Ma'am . " " Mr. Allerdice , " Andrew explained , " is kind enough to say he can find us clothing of a sort . " " Aye , that I wull , an ye wull excuse me a moment . " When the old man reappeared , he was carrying a simple gown of gray calico , a bundle of blue and white cotton petticoats , some crude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large for Minga 's feet , and a wide-brimmed leghorn hat . It was no woman 's hat at all , yet it would serve to ward off the blinding heat of a tropical sun . " ' T is but a puir collection for so fair a lady , " he apologized . Minga laughed , clutched the garments eagerly . " They look fit for a princess . How can I ever thank you , Mr. Allerdice ? " La ! It would be elegant to get out of the miserable , torn , stained garment in which she had existed this past week . " Be putting them on and combing yon bonnie hair of yours . Here  --  " He held out a comb , a length of blue grosgrain ribbon and a yellow kerchief . " Yell find privacy i ' the storeroom  --  too much o ' it , alas , " he sighed . " And noo , Captain Warren , let 's see what can be done for you . "  |p271In  a secluded corner of Mr. Allerdice 's vast and shadowy warehouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stepped out of the ill-smelling affair she noticed a pair of enormous black rats surveyingher from between the coils of a hawser piled to one side . Six months ago she would have screamed , then fainted genteelly  --  as became a lady . But now she merely flapped her discarded dress at them and , when they had rustled off , paused mother-naked behind a rampart of coffee sacks , letting her body breathe . A breeze had sprung up and caressed her damp shoulders , breasts , and thighs with cool , invisiblefingers . A subtle warmth enveloped her . La ! What had come over Minga Allen ? Here she was standing , naked as an egg , with Andrew Warren not a hundred feet distant . The realization , however , was not at all displeasing . If only there was n't Jerry to rememberAndrew  --  how capably , how calmly the wiry New Englander met each new problem . She 'd come to notice the vivacity of those black eyes of his  --  odd , she 'd never have believed she 'd favor dark eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; they were fashioned from rawhide , tinted a dull , rust-red . All the same , it was indeed good to find something separating her soles from the ground . Her feet , not having had time to develop protective callouses , had grown almighty tender . Softly she began to hum : " We 'll rather taste the bright Pomona 's store . No fruit shall ' scapeOur palates , from the damson to the grape . Then , full , we 'll seek a shadeAnd hear what music 's made . " Thank fortune , the Aliens followed the Church of England so were allowed the joys of poetry , music and painting . A pox on the longlaced , tight-lipped Puritans and Dissenters of New England ! Theft only music was hymns bellowed through their noses . It was with a rare sense of luxury that she tied about her slender waist a succession of petticoats . They were by no means of a quality with those which now were drifting somewhere about the Caribbean'sbottom . Their cleanliness , however , was bliss . Spirits soaring , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , softly-rounded stomach , discovered that the garment had been cut for a bosom far more ample and therefore swung dangerously low . A shrewd arrangement of Mr. Allerdice 's pale blue neckerchief , however , remedied the expose . Luckily , the kerchief went agreeably with sandals and dress . Lips contracted , she considered the great , floppy-brimmed hat . Adorned with a rust-colored ostrich feather , caught up on one side , the leghorn might even acquire a suggestion of modishness . Meanwhile Mr. Allerdice watched Andrew don long canvas trousers , a fresh dark red shirt , shoes , and a wide felt set with an enormous brass buckle . " I 've taken these garments out o ' stock which ai n't no longer mine , " said he simply . " Melhado can hale me to jail for it  --  but be damned to him , I 'll no ' see good King 's people go forlorn . My partner , Johnny Winde , stood the embargo so long as there was hope , then , wi ' ruin upon us , he made his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ o ' a horse pistol . " Let you and the lassie repair tae the Crown &; Dove ; tell Kendall there ye 're a friend o ' Jamie Allerdice and I warrant he 'll find shelter for ye , savin ' when a privateer makes port . " The Jamaican lowered red-rimmed eyes marked with little patches of white at their corners , fumbled in his pocket . " Six shillings , lad , is a miserable pittance , yet ' t is all I can spare now . " Andrew thanked him soberly . He would , he vowed , return the loan within a week and double it out of gratitude . Who ever had accused the Scots of being niggardly ? The sound of Minga 's returning footsteps caused the wizened little man to glance over a knobby shoulder . Andrew spoke hurriedly , " Mr. Allerdice , Mistress Allen has kinfolkhere , but I  --  well , you must have deduced that I 'm on the perch  --  broke . I must find a ship  --  immediately . Have you any suggestion ? " Come what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be commissioned . He 'd make the Marine Committee listen to reason . " Aiblins yell land a berth as second or third mate . ' T is verra unchancyye 've lost yer ship 's papers , " he spoke in lowered accents . " Yer speech and your be-damned-to-you way suggests the Yankee more than a true King 's man . " Not since she had set out for the Theater Royal had Minga felt such buoyancy  --  despite the heat , the disconsolate surroundings . Somehow , by sense of touch , she had dressed her hair  --  eyes shut , as she had used to back in Millwood when she had tried various coiffures up in the attic . Mama would have scolded , called her vain . " The idea ! A child of your age dressing hair ! " The ribbon was set neatly above her ear , the leghorn pinned up . " The Laird 's mercy ! " Mr. Allerdice gasped , when she re-entered the office : " Why , why , ' t was nothing I handed ye . " Andrew hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! The tension , the responsibility of the voyage removed  --  no matter how disastrously  --  left him eager , more than a little reckless . He understood now why Colonel Saunders had taken up with her . Probably she 'd been a desperate , penniless Tory refugee  --  good enough for ' em , too  --  and her unobtrusive beauty must have captured that red-faced old lecher 's eye . Well , well , and again  --  well . The French knew how to handle a poule de luxe and he 'd been around enough to catch on . The sun was lowering and the terrific heat of day was diminishing . Buzzards  --  the natives called them John crows  --  were craning naked , diseased-looking necks . One by one , they fluttered down from limewhitenedperches on roof tops , dead trees and fence posts . Hopping awkwardly , they set about exploring fly-infested mounds of offal . Negroes of all ages , semi-naked or wearing frayed cotton garments , raised their voices in hawking a variety of wares . " Cocay watah ! Cocay watah ! " intoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fresh coconuts . " Heah fresh millik ! " a bullet-headed child shrilled while she herdedp274a pair of fat-teated nanny goats . Also offered for sale were glowing baskets of oranges , pawpaws and pots of fammee  --  a dish of fish ground up with avocados . All within a few moments the dead streets of Montego Bay became populated with a languidly moving population  --  predominantly black . Gigs , oxcarts and kittareens  --  a species of two-wheeled gig peculiar to the island  --  began to roll by . A Naval officer in blue and gold stared curiously at the tall young couple as he strode along . Now and then a mounted officer would ride by , gold-laced tunic bright in the rich sunlightand his face shinier still with perspiration . " Trade here certainly appears to be deader than dead , " Andrew commented , indicating tall and dusty stacks of log , wood and mahogany . Rum casks and hogsheads of sugar cluttered every dock . The strollers lingered over a slat pen erected beside the water 's edge . In it dozens of sea-turtles with streamers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear green-blue water or drowsed on the surface , awaiting sale to ships which nowadays put in all too seldom . Minga allowed her gaze to wander over the harbor  --  bronze-colored in the late afternoon . " I fear I do n't comprehend , Captain  --  " She looked at him pleasantly , smiled . " Er  --  Andrew  --  if commerce here is at such a desperate pass , why do we find so many ships at anchor ? And see , most of them are freighted ; they ride deep in water . " It was as Minga pointed out . Above a dozen sizeable British merchantmen swung to moorings : the Augustus Caesar , the Lady Juliana , the Gamecock , the Princess Royal and the Lady Keith , and many others . Significantly , the only foreign craft in port were the Dutch schooner and a pair of Spanish sloops , the Pastoria and the Divina . " It 's small wonder you ask , " Andrew replied with a flash of white teeth , " but show me a pink , a snow , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size have to do with my question ? " Minga queried , brushing a mosquito from her neck . " Everything , " the New Englander told her . " Out there lie only bigp275ocean-going ships . A convoy making up for England . " Minga raised slim , perplexed brows . " Andrew , I must be dense . " " Jamaica , nor any of the other Indies , ever grew rich by trade with England alone . " " Why not ? " " The British market ca n't use a third of what 's grown in Jamaica , the Bahamas , Barbados , St. Kitts , and Grenada . " He stopped in the shade of a wide tamarind , turned a suddenly earnest face in her direction . " You see , Parliament and certain self-seeking and absentee landlords now carousing at home wo n't let a British colony sell direct to any other nation . " Sunlight , glancing off the harbor , struck up under Minga 's hat , emphasizing a perplexed V between her brows . " You ca n't be serious . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more so . Mark you , every ship from this island is on its way to a port in Russia , Germany , Spain , Portugal or France  --  anywhere on the Continent  --  but first she must put in at a British port and lose valuable time in paying duty . This , you 'll understand , makes it difficult for local planters to compete with the sugar , rum , and coffee grown in the French , Dutch and Spanish Indies . " She was astonished , had n't imagined or even thought on such matters , nor held opinions on them . " To require them to pay such a tax do n't seem right . " He offered her his arm and kept a sharp lookout . H.M.S. Squirrel was in from patrol duty now and her officers had begun to appear on shore . " Yes , that is one of their principal grievances against the Crown . " He enjoyed her obvious interest , continued , " You 'll discover , Minga , that it 's not generals and admirals that provoke wars  --  it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A muscle in his thin brown cheeks worked slowly . " On the other hand , powerful British merchants , through our Parliament  --  " he had to choke out the " our "  --  " force enormous quantities of Sheffield and Manchester goods onto the Colonial market . "  | " Force ? How ? " " Well , they do n't actually force them , but their factors in the islands tempt planters to over-spend  --  an easy matter since the bankingis done in England  --  and then hold the poor Colonials in a slavery of perpetual debt . They are very deft at the business . " Minga set her chin and her voice lost some of its softness . " I wo n't credit that the King or his ministers countenance such wicked practices . Really , Andrew , someone has misled you . " In the shade of a tall warehouse , they paused while she readjusted the straps on her sandals . While she did so a gaunt gingercomplexionedNegro shuffled up , a bundle of placards in one hand and a pot of paste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a broadsideto a hoarding which was already lumpy with countless notices , posters , and placards . The new one read : CONVOY NOTICEAdmiral 's Penn , May , ye 15 , 1773Application having been made to Me for a CONVOY for the Trade from Port Antonio and the different LADING PORTS on the North side of this ISLAND round to North Negril Point in order to join the CONVOY to Sail from thence the 1st of Next Month .

Dick &; MilliganAgents for the privateerSchooner GRAYHOUNDTheodosius Kendall , proprietor of the Crown &; Dove , proved to be an enormously obese Jamaican wearing thick , red-gold rings in his cars . More than a trace of Africa showed in his breeding . Wiping chubby hands on an apron , he bowed several times . " Welcome , Ma'am . Welcome , sir . Welcome to the Crown &; Dove . " " I am Captain Warren of  --  " " Late of the brig Evergreen , " he broke in . " Yessir , yessir . Most unfortunatebrush with the picaroons . My sympathy , sir . " Like a grotesque duck in a spotted white apron , the innkeeper bobbed up and down in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lavender-hued freckles scattered across the publican 's flat nose and almost spherical cheeks . Strangely animal-like , soft brown eyes , almost concealed by folds of fat , were inspecting the newcomers so steadily Andrew felt uneasy . The world over , many publicans were police spies . " May I grant myself the privilege of offering ye the best the Crown &; Dove ' as to offer ? " " Alas , we have but little money  --  " Minga cut in while crushing a centipede which threatened to crawl into her sandal . " Oh  --  " The oleaginous smirk faded.  | " My friend , Mr. Allerdice , especially recommended your tavern , " Andrew interrupted , at the same time throwing his companion a glance of sharp annoyance . Damn the wench . He was making the arrangements here . " Mr. Allerdice will vouch for my  --  for our  --  er  --  " " Integrity ? " Minga offered meekly . The name of James Allerdice , it appeared , still carried weight in Montego Bay . Mr. Kendall mopped his face , looked serious . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the old days , Ma'am , ' t was many a hundred pounds o ' custom he directed to this very door . " The Jamaican pursed blubbery lips and fetched a tremendous sigh . " Kwee ! as the Coromanteeniggers say . We are all grieved to see Mr. Allerdice ruined and nearing the grave with drink . Pray come in . " The innkeeper led into a courtyard shaded by a huge tamarind . Beneath had congregated a sad-eyed monkey , a flock of hens , two puppies , and a pair of stark-naked Negro babies . The last considered the intruders from round owl-like eyes ; then , when the innkeeper flapped his apron not unkindly at them , waddled across the court , fat little buttocks glistening . " Twins , " Mr. Kendall confided , " and a likely pair . Bred by my second cook to Major Casselman 's footman , a veritable giant of a man . Quite an affair , enjoyed by all concerned . " In the tamarind a handful of pigeons and parakeets commenced to chatter . At the entrance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reverberations caromed off the hills back of town . Andrew , listening hard , felt his heart commence to hammer . Another shot boomed , then another . Jerusha ! Suppose a Continentalman-o ' - war or a state cruiser like Connecticut 's Oliver Cromwellwas standing in ? Such cut-and-run tactics had , in the Bahamas , enabled Captain Rathburne in the Continental ship Providence to capture seven British vessels and then to plunder Fort Nassau at his leisure . More recently a bold Yankee privateer , off Savanna la Mar , had sent in his boats and cut out the Lady Moore , brigantine , under the muzzles of a battery . His hope faded when Mr. Kendall paid the gunfire not the least attention.  | " Well , sir , as I was saying , on Mr. Allerdice 's account I 'll let you and your sister have a nice clean room . " He tipped Andrew a wink of roguish understanding which sent bright stain cascading down Minga 's cheeks . Suppressing his amusement with difficulty , Andrew said , " You mistake us . Mistress Allen was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can pass word to relatives up coun-try . " " So , Ma'am , you have relatives ? This way , please . " Enormous rear swaying under breeches of unbleached linen , the Jamaican panted up an outside staircase . It led to a gallery which ran across two faces of the courtyard . " Sir Thomas Moffat is  --  was my uncle by marriage . " " Sir Thom  --  ! Ahem . Yes , Ma'am , to be sure , to be sure . " A change , as subtle as it was definite , took place in the innkeeper 's manner . " Sir Thomas was a rare fine gentleman , Ma'am , most highly esteemedby St. James County sassiety . " Kendall turned a yellowish moon of a face over one shoulder . " You have met Mrs. Moffat ? " he queried in a fiat , cautious tone . " Why , no . Is Mrs. Moffat  --  attractive ? " It was dead against Minga 's nature thus to discuss a member of the family ; yet curiosity would not be denied . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now , Ma'am , you can have this ' ere elegant apartment for  --  well , sixpence  --  and all the fruit you can eat . " A regular volley of cannon shots thundered among the hills back of Montego Bay . A spindle-legged Negro youth , disfigured by a big fleur-de-lisshapedbrand on his cheek , came pelting into the court . " Misto ' Kendall ! Misto ' Kendall , sar ! Two privateers standin ' in , with three prizes . " " Two privateers . You sure ? " " For sure , sar , " gasped the runner . " Bey salutin ' de port right w . Mr. Kendall 's air of languid affability departed . Cupping hands , he bowled into the courtyard.  | " Shep ! Phebba , Cubbenah ! Turn out , you lazy black bastards , turn out a-running or you 'll taste the flapper ! " From all corners of the tavern , slaves appeared on the run , formed a sable pool at the foot of the steps . " Phebba , you and Julie and Wimba start killin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fetch up limes and fruits . You there , Johnny , pour fresh water into the drip jars . " Mercury , John , Phillip , hump your backsides down to the waterfrontand man my cutter . Bring me the officers , else I 'll sell you to Barbados . " He paused for breath and mopped at the perspiration beginning to pour down his neck . " Junie , run over to Madame Phelibert 's , tell her to wash and scent a dozen o ' her prettiest trollops . They 're to be here by nine o'clock . And , Julie , tell that old bitch the girls must be Mustees . Samboes and Quarteroons wo n't do ! " Like a covey of quail threatened by a hawk , the slaves pattered off . Briskly rubbing pink palms , Mr. Kendall turned . " Under the circumstancesit ai n't possible to spare more than a single room at the price mentioned . Sorry , but business is business and privateersmen are free spenders . They 'll be wanting shore berths tonight . " Let me see , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this row . It ai n't too elegant . Still it 's better than the beach where the land crabs get you . Here you are . " It was a tiny dark chamber scarcely ten feet long by eight . " But  --  but  --  Mr. Kendall , " stammered Minga with a quick look at Andrew . " As I explained , we 're not related , nor are we m-married . " " I 'll make out on the beach , " Andrew said , though he relished the prospect not at all . Momentarily Kendall looked concerned . " Best not ; you 'll likely wake up aboard a convoy with a split scalp . Some o ' the masters are turrible short o ' hands . " The innkeeper was in obvious impatience to be away . " Again , if the fever 's abroad , you 'll be bound to take it . Tck ! Tck ! Well , I must attend my duties . "  |p231AFTER  the slashing heat of the day , to feel the cool vital air beating in from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Theodosius Kendall in a measure must have repented his churlish attitude , for , shortly after he had hurried away , a gangling mulattress had appeared at the door of that small chamber in which Andrew and Minga sat staring blankly at each other . She offered a basket which on examination was found to contain a cold fowl , a dish of hot fammee , some star apples , a great , hairy-husked coconut and a flask of not too terrible smelling rum . Also in the basket Andrew came across a fold of paper . Scrawled on it was a terse message , " Best stay near Lady , Captain . Privateers ashore ai nt gents . Yr. humble obdt. servant , T. Kendall . " Andrew could n't help laughing when the slave girl pattered off . There was nothing humble or obedient about T. Kendall  --  unless there was plenty of money in evidence . Minga smiled , patted her skirt , then picked up the basket and suggested , " I 've an idea , Andrew . Why not go down and eat beside the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems do n't appear quite so prodigious after supper . " They returned to the only spot on Montego Bay familiar to them Admiralty Dock . Slowly they advanced its sturdy stone length and Lind seats on a pile of decking planks . Sea birds wheeled lazily over cm , mewed , cocked yellow eyes , hopeful of waste . Bright-colored land birds frolicked among a tall clump of weeds sprouting from a crevice in the dock 's well-worn stone work . Minga sighed , spread her skirts out wide ih search of greater coolness and briefly regarded the lights of the harbor . Most were yellow , a few green , a few red . After they had eaten Andrew wandered over to a stack of cable and settled so comfortably on it that the girl followed . Presently he pulled out a clasp knife , opened it with an expert flick . " What in the world are you up to ? " " I am about to prepare for you , Minga my dear , the most elegant beverage you 've ever tasted . " Thoroughly intrigued , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the husk of a coconut . " Try some milk ? " He showed her how to tilt the coconut in order to drink . She was n't extra clever at it and the pale blue-white fluid dripped over her chin . " ' Nough ! ' Nough ! " " Now , ma petite , regarde-moi . " He felt so much better he was ready to talk French . With a steady sunburnt hand he tilted a measureof rum into the nut , grinned as he shook it . " Hark to that pleasant gurgling . " Her straight nose shone faintly , intriguingly in the after-glow as she tilted back her head . " I declare , Andrew , it 's hard to believe that you are all New Englander . " He smiled , his dark hair sooty against the starlight . " Neither in body nor spirit . You see , my mother was French  --  from Quebec . " " Then , indeed I shall have to become doubly wary of you . " " You 'd better , " he advised , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critters she probably wo n't heed the advice . " While he continued to jiggle the shell , he studied his companion . Her long slender form had relaxed itself against the thick , dark yellow-stained cable . She remained with arms outstretched , hair stirred by a breeze so balmy it must have lingered all day in some flower-dotted valley high among the Blue Mountains . For the first time in many weeks Minga was experiencing a sense of well-being . True , barring her silver and green bracelet , she had lost every last penny to her name and was utterly destitute ; yet shep283remained healthy , young , and she figured she possessed courage of a sort . Another cheering thought : she was sure from the way she felt tonightthere 'd be no aftermath of that ghastly business beside Hudson 's River . Whatever could have prevented things happening last month ? Belatedly she recalled some old wife 's tale about great frights , about the effect of sea voyages . Joyousness born of relief bubbled within her . Life was n't so rude after all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for . Why not evaluate Jamaica on its own worth ? There 'd be small sense in measuring the island by Brewster standards . One should never try to live one 's home life in foreign parts  --  that was what Papa had always maintained . Besides , what did Brewster matter now ? Suddenly she extended a hand , said lazily , " For heaven 's sake , Andy , stop worrying that coconut . " He grinned , nodded , and prepared to sample its contents . " Please , I 'd like a taste . " Andrew was surprised . For all her obvious relationship to Colonel Saunders she 'd been so prim , so conservative all along , this was a bit more than he had anticipated . Well , so much the better . A nod from Bacchus was always an encouragement to Eros . " Careful , " he warned . " Jamaica rum is n't Madeira . Even laced with coco milk , it can raise a blister on a doorknob . " At his worldliness impatience seized her . Andy Warren need n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was ? A gangle-legged , whey-faced school girl ? Had n't she travelled , had n't she attended a theater in New York ? Had n't she lived  --  well , lived ? She was n't go-g to stand for any more of this dratted condescension . Minga Allend learned how to care for herself ; besides , she reflected languidly , profile and that new dark red shirt were strongly appealing . Lips pursed prettily , Minga took half a mouthful . Not bad . Notat all . Quite pleasant , in fact . He must be teasing her . Warmlittle runlets commenced coursing through her . " You 're mean . Youme this was powerful . " Andrew made no immediate reply because he had up-ended the coconut , was drinking readily . Jerusha , this was more like it ! Now maybe he could forget for a while the disgrace of having lost his ship , of having been ignored by the Marine Committee . Eyes wide to the purple-blue heavens , he settled back , let his body slump against the cable , and revelled in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carousal aboard the victorious privateers . Both vessels had strung up battle lanterns until their yards and hulls were lit up like those Greek churches Andrew remembered seeing along the coasts of the Adriatic Sea . Bursts of strident laughter , concertina and guitar music came drifting over the black , lightspeckledharbor water . High over head some dried palm fronds rustled and a frog whistled softly among the old cannon on the dock . Andrew guessed he was lucky after all . A splinter might have gotten him there in Caicos Passage just as well as not . One of them had near split the brig 's colored cook in two . Aye . In the next engagement would he be so lucky ? The fragrant air stirred , set wavelets to lap-lapping at the slimy stonework of Admiralty Dock , brushed the girl 's hair back and forth across her cheek . Her lips were parted just enough to permit a faint highlight on her front teeth . When she noticed him looking at her , she made a little grimace . " It is very pleasant here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should like a little more of that coconut milk punch . " How magically the punch had removed uncertainties , fatigue , and anxieties ; wonderful stuff , coco-water and rum . Because he did not want her to get sick or become noisy , Andrew took the shell away as soon as she 'd taken one real swallow , and , so there 'd be no room for argument , he finished the last of it . Clouds of red-gold fireflies kept swirling over a small overgrown point of land nearby . Their light glowed so brilliantly that they even revealed the weather-warped figurehead of some long-captured prize . All along the shore whistling frogs were piping musically if monotonously.  |p285How  elegant it was just to lie here , Andrew reflected . Incredible that , last night , he and Minga had been aboard that damned little gig wondering if they were going to die of thirst . " Content ? I am , incredibly so . " Minga had laced fingers behind her head after placing Mr. Allerdice 's big leghorn hat beside the empty food basket . Softly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lo , all these trophies of affection hot , Of pensiv 'd and subdu 'd desires the tender , Nature hath charg 'd me that I hoard them not , But yield them up where I myself must render , That is , to you , my origin and ender ; For these , of force , must your oblations be , Since I their altar , you enpatron me . " Towards the end of the stanza she let a strength into her voiceuntil it streamed rich and warm like a satin ribbon unrolling . He thought it was time to take her hand ; sure enough , she did n't emove her fingers as he murmured , " Your singing , ma mignonne , is all that was needed to make an Hesperides of Jamaica . " " You liked my song ? " She leaned towards him slightly , her eyesfaintly luminous , and looked down on him as he half reclined . " I dote on it . " " Then I am pleased , Andrew . Exceedingly glad . " Her fingers closed gently on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , I have hardly known what to make of you . You are so  --  so fierce , so abrupt , so different . " Ills French blood all at once became predominant . " Mon Dieu ! That , you should never think of me . Not , at least , with you , ma mie . " English , he would always think , was a crippled , inadequate language in which to express subtleties of feeling . " Oh , please , " she said , " continue to talk French . I like it though can not understand a word . " " Why , then ? " " Because it sounds so pleasant . Like warm velvet . " So Andrew did . He talked , strangely enough , as never he could English . Odd , that facility which came to him in his mother's language . In his native tongue he seemed to grope whenever he felt truly moved . " Oh , Andrew , French is beautiful ! Beautiful ! " " Alors Mingue  --  " the name would not go as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me bien je t'adore ! " She recognized that . " Then you really  --  like me  --  truly ? " " Like ! " There was only one response to that ; his arms went about her . Nom de Dieu ! That old buck , Colonel Saunders , had known what he was about . What a wonderfully firm , soft body was Minga 's . Minga could n't help thinking , how much stronger Andrew 's arms were than Jerry 's ; and so much less gentle . This was wrong to be letting herself be caressed like this , she kept telling herself . Yet indefinablyshe did not feel this to be so . Jerry was dead . Poor gay , gallant Jerry ! She supposed their love had not more than commenced to blossom ? So to let Andrew say his piece could n't be truly disloyal . After all , she was n't giving Andrew a thing which had ever belonged to Jerry . In eager cadences this odd New Englander 's voice cascaded fascinating , unfamiliar phrases in her ear . The fragrance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her mouth lowered itself as her fingers sought his crisp black hair . Lord knew what would ensue but  --  plague take it , who knew what would ensue these days ? Andrew met impulse with impulse . Bigre ! Yes , Colonel Saunders certainly had known what was what . As the fragrant warmth of her mouth met his , he thought , What luck , my lad ! What ineffable luck ! Subconsciously , his hands sought the fullness of her loins . But he remembered . Go slow , Andre ! Doucement . Doucement ! He was surprised , pleased , to find himself so much under control . Non . Pas ici . Not here , like a couple of white trash . Later ; at the Crown &; Dove  --  decently . There , no drunken mariners or skulking Negro might shadow the iridescence of so priceless a moment . He heard her voice , soft as the breeze in the palms above . " Andrew , do you truly love me ? " " Aye ! " he told her in English . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Andrew , I  --  I 'm so glad ! I wanted to be sure of that , " Minga told him . Then she poured out her heart . Told him a thousand things about her dreams , her hopes , her longings that she 'd never betrayed to any man . Still , she made no mention of Jerry . Again and again they embraced , their bodies , fresh , vital and hungry , strained against each other until the lights of Montego Bay harbor wavered like swung torches . From amid a delicious , unfamiliar haze Minga thought , " What can have come over you , Minga ? Is this how the tropics affect people ? Does Jamaica thaw out New England nasty-niceness so quickly ? " She did n't know ; moreover , did n't care . Here was a new and fascinatingworld ; it was fine to discover Andrew Warren 's stalwart shoulder ready to interpose . At long last Andrew uttered an impatient sigh . " My dear , suppose we  --  well , we ca n't tarry here much longer . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were whining in voracious legions which a less amorous couple would have noticed an hour back . Piqued at having allowed him to take the initiative in the matter of departure , Minga sat up , clung a little to his shoulder . " Oh , Andrew  --  youare right , we must go . But why  --  Oh , it has been lovely , so sweetly memorable here on Admiralty Dock . " " Yes  --  unforgettable . " He smiled . Dieu de Dieu ! Why would so Iiuich time have to elapse before in the Crown &; DoveThey arose , a trifle embarrassedly and with elaborate care , brushed the dust from their clothing . Because Minga looked so jaunty with her leghorn tilted ' way back from the provocative outline of her face , Andrew drew her to him , all but crushed the breath out of her . She hoped he wanted never to relax from the warm substance of her body against him . Voices , the rattle of oars being shipped , putperiod to the moment and , hand in hand , they strolled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had walked$ length . " Dame Nature made a great mistake in you , Andrew , " she smiled when lights glowed ahead . " Mistake ? " " She made you a foot too tall . " Of course he knelt and briefly lowered his face to her level . Her fingertips closed over the back of his neck , imparting subtle impulses through his scalp and to his brain . Jerusha ! this girl was one in ten thousand  --  delicate , refined  --  and cognizant . When they got back to the Crown &; Dove , all these long weeks at sea would remain as a dreary memory . It was amazing to discover the streets of Montego Bay so crowded . Rendered incautious , Andrew actually smiled at scarlet-coated officers , flourished a cheery brown hand at red-faced officers ashore from H.M.S. Pegasus . Two by two , sambo , quarteroon , and mustee trollops sauntered by , swinging fans and loins in unison . That the port was uncommonly overpopulated tonight was inescapable . News of the new prizes in port must have spread like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fee-hungry magistrates , idle planters , curious merchants , and merchant seamen , restored by the cool air , were makingup for the long day 's deadening heat . All at once it happened and so suddenly there was no time for readjustment . About the last thing in the world a body would expect to see on the streets of Montego Bay was an officer wearing the uniform of the Continental Navy . Yet there one came ; blue coat , scarlet waistcoat , blue breeches , and white thread stockings . Arm in arm with a British lieutenant , this incredible apparition drew near . By ill luck the lights of a wine shop shone full on Andrew as he and his gracefully moving companion advanced along an earthen footwalk . Two yards distant the apparition in the shabby blue , red , and gold halted . " My stars and crown ! Why , if it ai n't Andy Warren ! " Desperately aware of the critical import of the recognition , Andrew drew himself very straight , bowed formally . " I fear , sir , you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensed Minga 's fingers stiffen as he added , " Joseph Whitcomb. "  |p289The  stranger swayed forward a step , grabbed at Andrew 's forearm . " Oh , go ' way ! Do n't try to game me . You remember me , George Holcomb ? Remember , we served in the old Providence together ? " " But , An  --  " Minga was looking at him in wide-eyed amazement . Why should Andrew deny his identity to an enemy officer ? What was this about having served aboard a vessel called the Providence ? With the warm haze of happiness so close about her it was too much to understand . The English officer , a jolly , red-faced fellow with reddened eyes , looked on , amused . " Oh , come off it , George . Warned you you 'd a ! combo too many . " " No . I know Andy  --  ca n't fool me . " Holcomb held out his hand , looked sober . " Sorry to see you here . When did they capture the Boston ? " " Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think , " Andrew said harshly , " and you are blocking our way . " Over the American lieutenant 's flushed features came a look of semi-drunken anger . " I get it . You pups in the Boston never were any good  --  deserted us in the Hancock , and now  --  " His narrow black eyes opened wide . " I know you , Andy Warren . You 've deserted ! You ca n't  --  " " Come ! This fellow 's three sheets in the wind ! " Andrew snapped and gave Minga 's arm a tug . She followed , but walked stiffly , mechanically , like someone on the verge of exhaustion.  |p290JERusHA  ! That had been a mighty mischance , Captain Andrew Warrenreflected as he strode along with Minga silent by his side . Sweat , he realized , was pouring down his face although it was cooler now than it had been in many hours . Of all the officers in the Continental Naval service , why would it have to have been Seth Holcomb he 'd encounter ? Oh , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sense would have played mum . Could Seth have piped up on purpose ? It was more than likely , come to think on it . Holcomb had hated his guts when he 'd been appointed sailing master to the Boston , frigate , whereas Holcomb had only landed a junior lieutenant 's berth aboard the Hancock , 32 guns . If ever two ships had been destined to create antagonism , it was they  --  even though both vessels had been Boston-built and rigged . The Lord alone knew how often Captains McNeill and Manly had bickered and fought . It would be a long time before officers on either ship would stop blaming each other for that crushing disaster off Nova Scotia which had cost the Continental Navy the swift handsomeHancock and the Fox , 28 guns , a brand new prize frigate taken from the British on June 7 , 1777 , but a few days earlier . Damn Seth Holcomb to hell and back ! The street had been crowded  --  had anyone read the situation  --  aright ? Andrew 's heart , he realized , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sandbag . Good thing that English lieutenant with Holcomb had been so potted  --  might have caused a nasty to-do if he 'd sensed the true situation .  |p291The  streets of Montego Bay at this hour were full of sound . British privateersmen of various ratings were running riot over the luxury of finding themselves ashore , over having taken so rich a pair of prizes . Bickering , wenching , drinking , and all manner of rough games were the order of the evening . Maybe it was their ribald remarksand bold glances which rendered Minga so silent . She walked along as if picking her way through a pestilential forest . Although Andrew addressed her once or twice , she made no reply . Well , he 'd best respect her abstraction . When they got back to the Crown &; Dove , they 'd recapture that delicious mood discovered on Admiralty Dock . She was a smart girl , was Minga Allen . Near as cute as Julie , back there in Bordeaux , who knew , all too well , how it paid to keep a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to all sorts of extravagant promises . The Crown &; Dove resembled not at all the drowsy , silent inn of the afternoon . All but a few of its windows blazed , sketched golden rectangles against the night . Half a dozen privateersmen in gaudy , self-devised uniforms were swilling sangaree on the stoop . They sobered only a little when a relief of sentries swung down Prince Street , with white crossbelts shining and bayonets sloped in sinister pale angles . Minga halted and filled her lungs when the officer in command of the detail , a brutal-appearing sergeant , marched past only a few feet distant . She said nothing , however . At the inn 's entrance Andrew had literally to force their way past a gang of hairy , heavily sweating officers out of the victorious privateers . The New Englander stood too tall to invite much interference , but one sandy-haired lieutenant stuttered , " Come with me , chickie , " nd made a snatch at Minga 's arm . Andrew landed a well-timed ow , sent the fellow crashing backwards into a tray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minga was being impressed by the let way he stood awaiting the next onslaught . Though two or three of the roisterers yelled , " Let 's get him , mates , " no one moved . When they got to their room and he had set the gourd lampwick uttering in its bath of tallow , Minga , instead of seating herself ,  | remained near the door , her lips compressed . She held her body very straight and her fingertips trembled gently . Andrew 's sense of elationmelted like the first snowflakes on a warm roof . So then , she had grasped the implications of Holcomb 's stupidity ? Furiously he fought to clear his mind of the last effects of the rum . He 'd better , and in a hurry . When a person was as fanatically Tory as Minga Allen , one could n't rest easy . " You seem to expect something , " he suggested . Her words came out in a flat and precise monotone . " What did that man , that  --  that Rebel prisoner , mean down there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sinking onto the edge of the bed . Instantly the gourd lamp dyed his lean features scarlet , emphasizedthe blackness of his eyes and hair , and projected his shadow in gigantic proportions on the whitewashed wall behind . " What did you fancy he could have meant ? " Minga ignored the question ; her gaze never wavered from his face . Above the crash made by a chair overturned below , she demanded , " Why did you tell him that your name was Whitcomb ? Why did you deny your own right name ? " Andrew , thinking more clearly now , perceived his danger . Smiling , he got up and , as if to open a window opening onto the street , crossed between the door and her . " I had reasons why I did n't wish to be recognized by Lieutenant Holcomb . " The blue and yellow kerchief covering Minga 's breast rose more swiftly . She commenced to breathe faster , resembled not at all the lovely languorous girl who had strained her mouth to his lips net half an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasons ? " she demanded evenly . He wanted to say , " None of your confounded business . " What right had she , a confounded Loyalist , to be questioning an officer of the United States Navy ? " I do n't like the fellow and never have . We grew up together . He hates me because I would n't join the Continental Navy . " Minga felt the flush on her face deepen as she stared at him . Insistentdevilish voices kept clamoring in her brain , " Andrew is ap293Rebel ! A Rebel officer . A Rebel ! A Rebel ! " He was lying  --  lying clumsily , stupidly . Her voice like a low note on a violoncello , she told him so . Perspiration began to sting at his temples as he protested , " I 'm not lying ! " Great God ! He could n't , must n't , dare n't admit his true convictions . This port was swarming with people who 'd be ready and eager to hang a Yankee spy . Minga 's body pressed itself to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remove herself from him as far as the room would permit . " You are lying ! " Her lips quivered as they formed her words . " All along , I 've wondered about you , Andrew Warren . You , sir , are a damned , disloyal Rebel . You are a perjured Yankee officer ! Oh , how I loathe and despise you . I  --  I  --  And to think that I  --  " Slowly , she dragged the back of one hand across her mouth . The accusations fell like weights from her lips . Stung , he took a couple of steps forward . " Well , and what if I am an American ? Who in hell are you to talk  --  you  --  you poor , soiled baggage ? " She need n't think now that he had n't understood the nature of her relation with Colonel Saunders ,  --  just what his protection had meant . From the way Minga winced and gasped , from the way her halfenunciatednext words died , from the way her eyes wavered aside , he knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swallowed painfully . " B-baggage ! " She shivered as through her loins and breasts flickered small hot impulses . " Soiled ? " How could he have learned about  --  about that ghastly night ? Merciful heavens ! Until now she 'd deemed her secret well kept . How hard Mrs. Ashton , Major de Vaux , Colonel Saunders , and the rest had plotted to keep it so . They were the only ones who knew for sure what had happened  --  they and the guilty Brunswickers . To keep the affair extra secret the three mercenaries , sniveling , bawling in their terror , had been hanged in the dead of night . It was amazing that Andrew Warren should have learned , amazing and crushing . What a fool she 'd been to dream that she might keep her name clean  --  despite everything.  | " I  --  I  --  You do n't  --  understand  --  " " I understand all too well ! " He moved closer , towered over her , his black eyes showering fury . The rum was working again . A damned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When he thought of the suffering of those poor devils rotting in prison hulks like the Jersey , of the sick in Dr. Blanchard 's " drydock , " of Pa pinned to the ground by Hessian bayonets , like a butterfly to a cork  --  by God , he hated all Tories . Making a rare effort , he controlled himself . Nona de Dieu , he 'd come to Jamaica to get those medicines , and get them he would , even though right now he had n't but two shillings to his name . No , he did n't intend to let this tart of a Loyalist interrupt that chance . " Steady on , Andy . Steady . Use your head . " Suddenly he saw his tack , caught her wrist and said grimly , " Look here , we 'll fashion us a deal out of this yet . Your people here in Jamaica do n't know you for what you really are , and I guess you ai n't over-anxious to have ' em learn . " He paused , trying to read her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only you and Holcomb know me for what I am . " Minga was aware of his dark Indian-like features dominating the flickering gloom . " You fail to perceive a distinction , " she told him . " Distinction ? " " Yes . What has happened to me is my own concern . What you have done is the affair of the Crown . My duty to my Kinb  --  " " To hell with that stupid , Hanoverian glutton ! " he blazed . His hand shot out as she dodged over to the window , but he only knocked her sidewise and she reeled on , put her head out of the window and screamed . " Help ! A spy ! The watch ! Here , the watch ! " " Damn your sluttish soul ! Be still ! " Frantically , he dove at her . He caught her , all right , and dealt her such a clip on the side of her face that her head whipped over onto her shoulder . She slipped down onto the floor , and crouched there panting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were open , they were for the moment unseeing . Heart hammering , Andrew looked down into the street , thenp295crossed the room and opened the door onto the courtyard . He felt reassured . The courtyard was full of strident laughter . The privateersmenwere playing some rough game , two of them had hoisted mustee wenches onto their backs . The girls were squealing , trying to knock each other off with cushions . Over it all calabash drums were thumping , fifes shrilling . Infinitely relieved , Andrew turned , grinning . " Go on , " he invited , " yell all you please . " Fearfully , she looked up ; felt her skin go cold . She would never forget him like this , with his black hair tumbled over his forehead in savage ringlets . When he turned and slammed shut the window , he resembled those Rebels who had come swarming into Millwood to destroy two-generations ' accumulation of fine property . " Help ! " she screamed . " A spy ! Help me ! " He was a traitor and must hang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tightened his belt . Her terror was somehow fascinating ; the rum was running again in his veins . Nom de Dieu ! this promised to be sport such as he 'd never before enjoyed . Along the littoral of the Mediterranean sailors like their wenches to squall and to kick up a fuss . In a moment now he 'd take her . Not gently as he had planned , but furiously , ripping her garments where they interfered . Outside the carouse was growing wilder , bawdy songs were ringing up into the great cottonwood in the courtyard and the music had reverted to the African Coast . Far louder than Minga 's cries , an oboe was squealing just below the gallery . There was n't a chance in the world anybody would notice . " Now , my pretty pet , you can make yourself pleasing . " His hand slipped under her arms , lifted her to her feet . He pulled her , crushed her to him . " Oh , Andrew , no  --  please , no ! " She should have been revoltedbut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coils of a cable , tightened slowly , powerfully . All at once his head come away from the embrace . Almost subconsciouslyhe had detected a peculiar rhythm in the pattern of noise outside . It sounded familiar  --  it was . It was the sound of men marchingin step . The music , the singing faltered and died away into discords . Flinging her aside , he rushed to the door , thrust his head out into a glare of torches in time to watch a file of scarlet-clad black soldiers in pointed leather caps come pounding into the courtyard . The officer who had accompanied Holcomb was at their head . The privateersmenwere cursing and gaping , but making way . " Up there ! " From among the disordered tables Kendall was pointing with a fat forefinger . " Up there . They 're in there . " As from the depths of a bowl of smoky coals , faces were staring up at him . A fierce yell arose when they noticed his head peering out of the room . Andrew hesitated not even long enough to turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lying crumpled , weeping , on the bed . With an expertness born of long years of clambering about rigging , Andrew caught a bougainvillea vine which came cascading down over the roof and swung himself up , up until he felt warm earthenwaretiles under his knees . The vine crawled along the apex of the roof a distance . " There he is ! " a voice yelled . " Shoot ! Shoot , you black bastards ! " As he went scrambling along the roof , a musket barked and a bullet knocked chips of tile into his face . " Get him ! Quick ! " When he swung into the branches of a tamarind , a staccato volley banged in the courtyard and twigs and leaves fell all about him . " Spy ! ' Ware , spy ! " The cry began to be repeated in the street . If ever he was to find Carlos Cardozo , he 'd have to have plenty of luck tonight , Andrew realized , as he dropped to earth and commenced to run.  |p297THE  KITTAREEN rasped the steel tire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the sand . This was no proper road at all , Minga Allen observed , but the dry bed of an old river . At this point the dead stream paralleled the fast-flowing yellow-green Montego . Mr. Angus Hamilton , bailiff of the Hinton Estates in WestmorelandParish , leaned forward , clucked at his gray mule , and so set the vehicle to jolting and bouncing faster , until its motion reminded Minga of that of a cornpopper held over the coals . What a tidy piece of good fortune first to encounter this friend of Mr. Kendall 's , then to find him on the eve of returning to the estates he supervised . She had been smart enough to trade transportation with Mr. Kendall for an assurance to the Crown officers that the owner of the Crown &; Dove had harbored one Andrew Warren , a Yankee spy , in all innocence . The publican had been desperately anxious when the port commandant had begun barking questions at him . What in truth had happened to the fugitive ? Rumors had circulatedthat he had been taken , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spy had got away scot-free . Resolutely , Minga diverted her thoughts to the future . It was infinitelystimulating to realize that , at long last , Moffat 's Penn lay only a few miles ahead . Here she was riding through a wild , lush countryside which for the moment was quite flat . There had been dense stretches of woods , separating great , heat-brightened vistas of sugar-cane fields .  | During the long trip up from Montego Bay the bailiff , garrulous , kindly and wise in the planting of sugar cane , had answered her multitude of eager questions , had explained how the great industry operated . During the late summer months the land , he told her , was manured by the flying pens  --  movable cattle folds . " The cuttings , Ma'am , are placed in cane holes three to four feet wide and about eight inches deep  --  with maize , or corn as ye term it in America , planted in the middle to grow and shade the young cane . " He spoke of the hazards of planting ; of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hordes of rats , of hurricanes , droughts and , worst of all , of the sudden , fierce fires set by careless or rebellious slaves . Damaged or tainted cane , Minga learned , was promptly rendered into rum . Mold from river banks was better fertilizer than cattle droppings on trash-tops of sugar canes . Slaves should n't be worked much in the rainy season  --  it was bad for their health . " When ye get to Moffat 's Penn , Ma'am , be sure to view the boiling house . ' T is there the juice is rendered after the mills have ground it . " " What turns the mills , Mr. Hamilton ? " " Wind , water , oxen , slaves  --  whatever is most convenient . " " What do they use at Moffat 's Penn ? " " Slaves , " the bailiff said and looked aside as most everyone did at mention of the estate . There must be something odd about Aunt Adelina 's property  --  of that Minga was entirely aware by now . Angus Hamilton , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situated some five or six miles further up the Montego from the Moffat property . Minga was relieved when , suddenly , the road left the old river bed and began to wind in and out through tangles of grenadilla , cordiums , and cottonwoods . In the treetops countless parrakeets , or love birds , chittered and played . Ears canted forward , the mule jogged along more rapidly now that the sun had slipped over the crest of a range of mountains and the air was growing cooler . The countryside seemed to abound in wild life  --  if one looked carefully , one could see lizards , quail , ground doves , humming birdsp299brilliant as dabs of paint on a palette , and strange red and black birds with enormous bills . When the road paralleled the Montego flowing with tawny impatience towards the Caribbean , they could see hideous , muddy alligators drowsing on its banks . " Up above Hinton 's , the river 's prettier , " Hamilton explained . " It 's just one wild cataract after another . Over yonder , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Squire Strudwick 's plantation . A main fine chap is Squire Strudwick . " The bailiff gave Minga a sidewise glance . " Bear in mind he 's a neighbor , next door , so to speak . " Again Minga wondered , finally made brave to inquire , " And pray , Mr. Hamilton , why do you and everyone else speak so guardedly of Moffat 's Penn ? " " Oh , I 'd no such intent , Ma'am . Indeed not , " the bailiff broke out . " Mrs. Moffat 's a very handsome and talented lady . Very capable . Manages the estate herself , now that poor Sir Thomas is gone . " A great shock to the parish  --  his going so sudden-like . Now there , Ma'am , was a man who could handle his bookkeepers  --  keep ' em going the full five years and more , as a rule . " Bookkeepers , Minga soon learned , were young men imported from the British Isles , Englishmen and Scots who , in exchange for passage , sold their services for five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year . Irishmen , of course , got less . " Lord , Lord ! " Hamilton sighed and cleaned his steel-rimmed spectacleson a grimy handkerchief , " I fancy I 'm the last of all of us who came out back in ' 58 . " " Did you find the keeping of books particularly tedious ? " A rasping laugh escaped the dumpy little man at her side . " Lord love ye , Ma'am , bookkeepers do n't keep books in Jamaica . They 're slave drivers , that 's what they are  --  nothing more nor less . But we nasty-nice English ca n't abide to call them that . " He slapped the reins on the mule 's loins . " It 's a dog 's life , Ma'am , what with sitting up every other night in the boiling house , checking the slaves ' thieving , getting the sugar aboard ship , and punishing evil-doers. " p 300 " Then , on the same principle , an attorney is n't an attorney ? " " An attorney , " Hamilton explained , " is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to be sure , who administers the affairs of an estate , be it a penn , a polink , or a coffee mountain . T is he buys the slaves , tends to discipline , hires and discharges bookkeepers . We do n't have to discharge many , though , " Hamilton added , as a drove of wild pigs pattered from a thicket across the road and became lost in a furious tangle of trumpet vines . Nov that the road was smooth Minga was content to settle back on the kittareen 's musty-smelling cushions . Merciful heavens , her backside felt as though it had been kicked in a dozen places ! " No need to discharge the poor devils , not when Old Bones tends to it for you . ' T is at a fearful rate salt food , rum and the sambo wenches carry off your young bookkeepers . " " Sambo wenches ? I do n't  --  ca n't understand . " Quite matter-of-fact , Hamilton replied , " Most plantation owners , Ma'am , pay their bookkeepers a bonus  --  generally a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What ! " " Aye , this is indeed a heartbreaking land , Ma'am  --  desperate lonesome ; these poor devils are poor , poor as the John crows . Mulattoes  --  girls in particular  --  fetch high prices in Jamaica . " " Oh ! " " So it 's small wonder , when rum 's to be had for the asking and black wenches for the crooking of a finger , that they do n't last long . " " You spoke of a sambo ' ; exactly what is that ? " Mr. Hamilton braced his feet as the kittareen lurched into a set of ruts . " Why it goes like this . A sambo is born of a black and a mulatto ; a mulatto of a white and a black ; a quarteroon or quadroon of a white and a mulatto , and a mustee of a quadroon and a white . " The bailiff sighed . " Aye , like I said , precious few whites ever live out their span . There 's the dysentery , the lung fever , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the yellow jack . You would n't believe , Ma'am , what I have seen . There have been times when a body could ridep301a-horseback for half a day , and find nothing but empty houses . Corpses lying in the road , in the ditches , in the guinea yards . The John crows  --  up in America they call them buzzards  --  were fed so full they could n't flap off the ground . " " But , Mr. Hamilton , it is n't right . Jamaica looks so lovely , " Minga protested . " Look  --  look yonder . See all those flowers and blossoms ; look at that wonderful tree with the scarlet blooms . It 's beautiful  --  " " Beautiful like paint over a boil , " Hamilton grunted , steering the mule to one side as a huge oxcart appeared creaking and lurching under a heavy mound of sugar canes . " Now up in the mountains , it 's fine and healthful , to be sure . Next year I intend buying a coffee mountain over near Port Antonio . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll send home for a girl from England . " The road wound out into the open once more and presently passed a fine , neat-looking residence , almost a mansion it was in proportions . The structure 's main floor was elevated perhaps ten feet from the ground by brick pillars , and green shutters screened two sets of galleries which appeared to run all the way round the house itself . " That 's Pondicherry House , " Hamilton explained . " Built by a Colonel Chandos . Died in a battle in America last year . I expect he never thought  --  " "  --  What a queer fence ! What in the world is it made off ? " " You 'll be referring to yonder penguin fence ? " Indeed that was what the barrier resembled . Cacti , which had been planted very close together and then trimmed off short , had healed into dumpy rounded figures which suggested rows of tenpins or , more imaginatively , penguins . Covered with long white spines , the barrier looked formidable , indeed . On rounding a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowd of half naked , incredibly ragged Negroes of all ages . In the center of a loose ring two enormous black bucks were backing away from each other ; jabbering and snarling , they kept their hands behind them with fingers twisted into their belts . " Ah make duppy of yo ' , Benjy ! " one of the two bellowed . " Hyo , hyo ! " the crowd burst out . " Dey lib for goat . "  | Before Minga had opportunity to inquire , the two bucks lowered bullet-shaped heads and dashed furiously for each other . With an audible t-thunk ! they met head on . " Oh , ki-ki ! " One of them staggered , swayed , then , his eyes half closed , sat down so violently that dust spurted out from under him . But for all that , he held his hands behind him . " Butting duel , " the bailiff grunted . " Fool niggers ca n't hurt themselvesmuch . " For the life of her , Minga could n't guess what they were trying to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trickle of blood from his forehead , and backed away . " Dis time Ah chaw yo ' like galli-wasp , " panted the other as again the duellists charged each other like sable battering rams . Hamilton paid only the least of attention . " Damned idiots will keep on like that until one knocks the other out . It 's a wonder , Ma'am , they do n't bash their stupid heads in , but they never do . " When the kittareen drew nearer , the onlookers scattered , barebreastedwenches squalling and naked pickaninnies legging it furiouslythrough gaps in the penguin fence . In less than half a minute there remained by the roadside only an old , withered man and a pale young woman hobbling along on a bent , crutch-like stick . She progressedwith an odd bobbing gait , one leg dragging . Near the heel showed a purple scar . At once Minga recognized that the frightened girl was , in a way , lovely . Eyes rolling fearfully , back muscles rippling , she hobbled along towards a break in the fence and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minga could only think of the halt leading the blind . When the kittareen came rocking up , the girl dropped her crutch and cringed into the ditch . The old man tottered a few steps , then knelt at the roadside , hands raised in supplication . Hamilton asked , " Notice that wench ? " " Yes . Poor thing is terribly lame . " With a whalebone whip Hamilton flicked the mule . " An habitual runaway , three times and over , " he explained carelessly . " Owner'sp303had her hamstrung . She wo n't run away again . " " Hamstrung ! " Incredulous , Minga stared at the handsome Negress . She was peering fearfully out of the crook of her elbow . " You mean her owner ordered her to be lamed  --  forever ? " At the sight of that puckered scar she felt her stomach muscles flutter . " What else can you do ? " the bailiff queried in surprise . " Ca n't go paying travel money and rewards forever . " The breath departed from Minga 's body as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to settle over the forlorn figures . " What was it you said , Mr. Hamilton ? " " I said when a slave runs away more than three times , the owner either whips him to death as an example  --  or cuts the rascal 's Achilles tendon . Have to , you know , Ma'am , or every last black would run off to join the Maroons . Now , the Maroons  --  " " What are they ? " The bailiff scratched a lean and leathery jaw . " Some say one thing ; some say another . General Penn and Admiral Venables drove the Spaniards out of Jamaica back in 1655 , you know  --  chased ' em out so fast the Dons could n't take their slaves with ' em . " Mr. Hamilton sobered , glanced towards the mountains now towering like a titanic palisade above the river valley . " When the Spaniards sailed away , their slaves  --  called Cimarrons  --  took a country called The Land of Look Behind , ' otherwise , the Cockpit Country , which is too near here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Country ? " " Not thirty miles distant  --  over that way . Some say the Cockpit is the vent of an old volcano . At any rate , many of the Cimarro.ns went up in there . Various governors have tried to dislodge them , but they have n't succeeded . " They 've had their own government of a sort for some time , under a black fellow who calls himself Colonel . ' At first the Royal Governmentused to fight them , but now  --  well , the planters pay the Colonel so much a head for each runaway slave returned  --  so the Maroons bring them back . They 're smart as niggers go  --  country 's getting crowded  --  do n't want too many people up in that valley . "  | " But are they always content to stay there ? " Under his floppy straw hat Hamilton frowned , then eased the mule 's rein because the road had commenced to climb . On the side of a hill some two miles distant glowed a white speck , brilliant against the green background . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ma'am , is where you are bound , " he explained . " Hawthorn Hall 's the name of the house  --  as pretty a spot as there is west of St. Jago de la Vega . But , as I was saying , Ma'am , the Maroons behave some years , do n't the others . Depends who 's Colonel . They 've a new one , " he added . " Old Papeen died last month . " Mr. Hamilton fished in his pocket and produced a pouch of tobacco . From it he fished a lump of shreddings which he stowed squirrel-like in his cheek . " Every time there 's a new Colonel , the planters get nervous . Most of ' em ai n't followed the law . " Under the leghorn tied to her head with a topaz-hued kerchief , the girl 's sunburned features turned towards him . " What law , Mr. Hamilton ? " " By law , an owner is required to keep on his property one white man for his first hundred guinea birds , and another buckra  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ai n't one estate out of ten follows the law . Greed , Ma'am , will cause the downfall of Jamaica . " As the slope increased Mr. Hamilton 's gray mule tilted its ears back over its neck , leaned into its breast strap , and put its feet down hard . " See that milestone ? " Minga turned her eyes aside from the Montego . The river was leaping , vaulting and gurgling over a barrier of great boulders . At a **25;7567;TOOLONG stood a short , moss-covered pillar . " That 's the northwest boundary of Moffat 's Penn , " the bailiff told her soberly . Two or three John crows which had been perched , roundshouldered , on a sign post craned scaly , naked necks , and flapped lazily away . The object of their previous attention remained dangling from a bough . Suspended from a cord was a length of meat and bonep305which continued to revolve in the bluish shadows cast by the mountains . " What in the world is that ? " " I told you Jamaica 's a hard land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inexpressible horror , the dangling object proved to be a human leg suspended by its ankle . So recently had the limb been severed that the parched earth beneath showed a scattering of rustyredsplotches . " Tchk ! tchk ! " Hamilton grunted , " looks like they 've been having t rouble at Hawthorn Hall . " " Trouble ? What kind of trouble ? " Minga fixed her eyes on the mule 's dust-flecked rump . " Murder ? " " Oh , scarcely that . I venture some slave raised his hand towards a bookkeeper . When a guinea bird does that , there 's nothing for it but hang him . Law says they must be quartered then and a limb exposed at each corner of the property as a warning . A sensible provision , too , I might add . " From the way she went pale and closed her eyes , the bailiff sensed how inexpressibly shocked his passenger was . " No doubt you deem us Jamaicans hard and merciless people , Ma'am . Well , maybe we are but , as Governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , use your club and spurs freely , else the beast will rend you . ' "  |p306MR  . HAMILTON was polite , but definite , as he stood adjusting a quarter-strap . " Thank ye kindly , Ma'am , but I 've no time to stop in . I 'd like to , mind you , but I be late up to Hinton 's as it is , and Jeremiah , " he nodded at the mule , " is tired . Besides , looks like it 's coming on to thunderstorm . " This was no exaggeration  --  a tremendous black cloud had , with the suddenness of a magician 's trick , splashed over the blue-green crest of those not very distant mountains towering above the wide cane fields of Moffat 's Penn . On the far side of them , mused Minga , lay the Cockpit Country  --  savage and untravelled . " ' T is but a short distance to the mansion , " the bailiff added . " You have only to walk through the black village and then you 'll see Hawthorn Hall ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At least it was when Sir Tom was living . " The bailiff ran a rather greasy , dull brown cuff across his forehead , at the same time considered her seriously . " Pray recall what I say , Mistress Allen  --  the Strudwicks are good neighbors . The Squire  --  well , he 's kept to English ways more than most in these parts . " For all she was bathed in perspiration , Minga smiled her best smile as she alighted . " I vow I do n't know whatever I would have done without you , Mr. Hamilton . You have been enormously kind  --  and instructive . " He certainly had been that . Right now her mind was a-boil with all the hints , facts , and conjectures with which he had supplied her during the long ride up the course of the Montego . She could hear the river rushing and pounding in the distancep307so clearly there could be no doubt that a storm was brewing . Off the crest of the billowing black clouds glanced dull orange-red reflections cast by a sunset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cane fields fell a hushed stillness in which the moaning of a conch-shell bugle , sounding orders for some slave gang , sounded very clear . " Well , goodbye , Mistress Allen , and good luck to you . " The bailiff scrambled back up onto the kittareen 's shapeless seat , and flapped his reins across the gray mule 's rump . The gig 's spidery wheels commenced to revolve and , very soon , Minga found herself standing quite alone at the entrance of a dusty drive which , lined with tall royal palms , stretched for an indeterminate distance up a gentle slope . Never had she felt quite so forlorn or so uncertain . Well , there was nothing for it but to walk on . One small consolation was that she had n't any luggage to carry , not even a kerchief . Beyond her bracelet and the things Mr. Allerdice had given her , three days back , she had n't a thing in the world . Her heated features contracted . If only she 'd had opportunity first to communicate with her Aunt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went this way . Urn . What would Mrs. Moffat think of her niece ? Child of her maternal grandmother 's second marriage , Aunt Adelina could n't be so very old . " Well , I 've been through plenty worse than this , " she reminded herself . She guessed she should be able to cope with Aunt Adelina . Was n't it strange how events could pile up all at once ? For nineteen years her existence had been so placid , so secure , almost luxurious , and then all in a year  --  Millwood looted and burnt , Cowboys , Brunswickers , picaroons . The most overwhelming blow of all , though , had been the exposure of Andrew Warren . Think of Andrew as a Rebel and an officer in the enemy service to boot ! To think that she 'd all but decided that Andrew , and not Jerry Vaughan , had been destined to play the dominating role in the drama of her life . Her suncracked lips tightened . A plague take Andrew Warren ! Had they really captured him ? If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure enough --  She shivered . She commenced to walk along the driv ' , avoiding the many ruts and holes . In the mountains a peal of thunder boomed like theopen- gun in a salute . Refusing to develop her present thoughts , Minga quickened her pace until she found herself almost trotting along under the palms , the dried fronds of which had begun to twitch under restless puffs of wind . To her right appeared what must be the slave village Mr. Hamilton had mentioned . The huts of palm thatch and whitewashed board construction were arranged in four long rows , each with a little garden , or plantain walk , stretching out behind . Pigs and chickens were noticeably scarce , and what few children were about looked gaunt and dull-skinned . All these last went naked , even girls of ten and twelve . So little activity was evident , she deduced that the field gangs must still be at work . A few aged or pregnant women squatted on their hams about a kettle which apparently contained little of interest . In the depths of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drearily . Recent neglect seemed to have overtaken previous care ; piles of crushed stone , standing ready for use , had not been used to fill dangerously deep ruts in the drive . Because the wind began to blow hard enough to send bits of coconuthusks and streamers of dried palm fronds scrabbling across the road , she quickened her pace . Soon Minga 's nostrils wrinkled to a peculiar sour-sweetish smell which seemed to emanate from a great shed-like structure beyond the slave quarters . It boasted a tall brick chimney from which gray-blue smoke erupted , then sank to cling to the earth and creep off as if ashamed of its existence . Ever more frequently thunder boomed ; flocks of white-winged pigeons began streaking by from the fields on their way to shelter in the forest rising at the foot of the mountains . Vivid streaks of lightning played over the purple-black mountain . There was more activity in the slave village now ; chattering in some West Coast dialect , the slaves ran to secure stray livestock and children . Shutters commenced banging to . Cattle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their eyes white and nervous.  |p309All  at once Hawthorn Hall loomed white and stately before her . Three tall storeys high stood Adelina Moffat 's house of stone and timber . What in New England would be called " welcoming arms " steps of an unusual design led up to the main or second floor . Both wings of the staircase , she observed , were guarded by wrought-iron railings of remarkable beauty . In crimson splendor heavy bougainvillea vines clambered up stone pillars supporting the upper floors and spouted towards the mansion 's pointed roof . A wide gallery , shaded by bamboo lattices , encircled the whole house . Under these porticoes quantities of poultry and peacockshad taken refuge . To either side of the main house extended covered passages or cloisters which connected with smaller buildings , also white-painted . Again the thunder exploded , this time terrifyingly near and prompt . Then the sky darkened to a livid purple-black so swiftly that , in no time , Minga was hard put to see her way . Another lance of lightning fell , hissing and crackling , into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thunder clap was indeed awe-inspiring , made the very ground quiver . Still no rain fell , though the air was overladen with moisture . Hurriedly , Minga ascended the staircase , looking all the while for a bell-pull ; she could find none . To her astonishment , no one was in sight , though Hawthorn Hall 's magnificently carved mahogany doors stood ajar . No lights had been lit , but the interior was full of slammings and bangings . Uncertainly , Minga fingered the knocker , a massive affair shaped like a leopard 's head and executed in brass . The wind was fairly booming now , tearing at Minga 's skirts and hat , and raising gritty clouds of dust . Half a dozen peacocks appeared flying out of a field , screamed , settled in a formal garden at the left and disappeared under a bank of shrubbery . Next , a string of small gray donkeys galloped by below , ears flat to their backs . Minga knocked again , more boldly . From inside came no sound beyond the faint tinkle of some stringed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she called , " please , is there anybody about ? " Her only answer was a great gust of wind , followed by almost solid sheets of rain that whirled indoors as had spindrift over the Evergreen'sbow . Terrifyingly loud was the continued hissing , dry cackle of lightning . One bolt could not have struck very far distant for , instantly , the whole ponderous house trembled and reverberated to a most heart-stilling crack of thunder . Minga had hardly caught her breath when another bolt hissed past . By its brief and unreal light she glimpsed cottonwoods , pawpaws and tamarinds dancing a frenzied minuet before the blast . Like the riffles of an expert drum corps , successivebillows of rain lashed at shutters which rattled and slatted . To avoid getting more drenched than she was , Minga stepped insideand was peering about in the gloom when a draught slammed shut the door . Though she strained her eyes , she could n't see much beyond the dim outlines of many glassless windows . The house was full of sound , and only faintly now could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despite the rain hurled in fury against the blinds . When her ears accustomed themselves to the uproar , Minga commenced to recognize the sound of voices , quite a few voices . Down a hallway a light glimmered , glanced off a door of well-polished satinwood , winked cheerfully on its brass door handle , then became multiplied on a floor as smooth and bright as the dining-room table had been at Millwood . The candle advanced . Mercy ! What could she find to say ? Involuntarily she stepped back , tried to get back out of doors , to enter properly . Too late . Above the flame of a candle shielded by a hurricane glass appeared in the humid dark as beautiful a face as Minga Allen had ever beheld  --  aface rendered in gold , rather than in silver , tints . " Please do n't misunderstand , " Minga began . " You see , the door  --  " " Oh ! " Full lips formed a startled crimson circle . " Who 's that ? " Now Minga could observe the apparition more closely . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creature her color key . Glistening jet hair was drawn into a fascinating arrangement , topped by an enormous tortoise-shell comb tipped with little gold beads . From the girl 's delicate ears hung flat earbobs of fine gold filigree . Her dress looked to be of fine yellow lawn looped with little crimson bows.  |p311When  the girl saw how damp , dishevelled and bedraggled the stranger was , her manner underwent a change . Her head went back and her eyes narrowed themselves . Haughtily , she demanded , " What are you doing in here ? Who are you ? Answer up ! " That a person of color should have dared even to address her thus had never occurred to Minga . She was tired and did n't care a rap right now whether school kept or not . She drew herself up , inches taller than the other , and demanded in monumental dignity : " Are you a servant here ? " By using a similar tone of voice Mamma had been able to check the most obstreperous slave judge Allen had ever owned . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  so Minga judged her  --  stared , dark eyes suddenly very wide above the candle flame . A terrific crash of thunder held everything breathless . The harp music continued unchecked . From a room down the hall , however , arose frightened whimpering . " Do n't stand there staring like a ninny , " Minga snapped . She knew now for sure that this golden girl was what she suspected  --  a Creole , and not a Spaniard or a Frenchwoman , or an Italian . " Put that light down and go find Mrs. Moffat . " " Excuse me please , Mistress , but  --  " The girl 's bearing returned to her original manner . " I do n't think Mrs. Moffat will  --  " Because she was wet and hungry and uncertain and angry at this girl 's attempt at patronage , she snapped , " Mrs. Moffat is my aunt  --  I am Mistress Allen of New York . Must I tell you twice to announce me ? " Without warning the front doors blew open and in the sudden inrush of wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tinkling music kept on . The golden girl ran to pick up the broken glass , her little feet in scarlet slippers whispering softly over the glossy floor . Minga was not afraid now , was surer of herself than she had been in a year . Why not ? Had n't she weathered , more or less successfully , None pretty severe tempests ? " Who are you ? " she demanded in a milder tone . " Please , Mistress , I 'm Chloe , Mrs. Moffat 's confidante . "  | Confidante ? What in mercy 's name was a confidante ? The two stood there  --  the golden-brown girl in her full-skirted yellow lawn dress , French lace blouse and vivid scarlet slippers ; Minga in the limp blue cotton dress , leghorn hat , and shapeless shoes Mr. Allerdice had bestowed . She was n't wearing even a suspicion of stays , stockings , or a decent number of petticoats . " You may show me to Mrs. Moffat . " " Why , yes , but if Mrs. Moffat is  --  well  --  if there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped the slightest imaginable curtsy , turned to a great circular staircase of glowing , beautifully polished mahogany . The further they mounted the stairs , the louder the sound of harp music grew . " Please , Mistress , do n't go in  --  " " Nonsense . " Minga was amazed at herself . Yet , in its day , Millwoodhad conceded nothing to this elegant menage . " That door . " Though Chloe looked downright anxious , a curious half smile sketched pallid teeth between lips sharply etched in crimson . Clearly she admired this stranger 's temerity . Minga knocked . There was no response beyond the harp music . The tune was an old Welch air . She knocked again . The music stopped . " Come in , Chloe , you damned yellow idiot . " The voice was controlled , chilly beautiful , like a hillside spring on an August afternoon . " Why does the least little storm send all you breeds off into tizzies ? Why could n't you find the Malaga sooner ? " Slowly Minga opened the door , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozen candles , by a gust of some fascinating perfume which set her nostrils to tingling . In an enormously lofty bedrooma single radiant figure was seated at a small harp . To be freer to play , Adelina Moffat had slipped a gown of pale blue chiffon from her shoulders , and so sat nude to the waist . She could not have been more than thirty-one or thirty-two , and her hair shone like well-polished old silver , giving off elusive bluish tints . Her face , a trifle too long to be of perfect classic beauty , was not facile , yet not wooden , either . A small , bright mouth showed up sharp as the imprint of a deer 's hoof on new fallen snow . Adelina Moffat'sp313eyes were memorable , Minga decided all in an instant  --  brilliantly blue , large , and set fascinatingly wide apart . " Well , and who in Tophet are you , my dear ? " The woman at the harp made no effort to cover herself , only flexed her arms , slowly , lazily , like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moffat ? " " For better or for worse  --  as once I said . " Deliberately the figure on the love seat swung slim , stately legs past the bulge of her harp . Minga always had yearned for legs like those  --  her own were good , but a shade on the muscular side . Half smiling , half frowning , Adelina Moffat leaned back , her small breasts rising in firm points as she did so . " But pray , Mistress , what business is it of yours ? " Her brows , which looked soft as if cut out of mouse skin , rose in fascinating arches . " Who are you ? Come , I wo n't bite your head off . " " I 'm Minga Allen , from Brewster , New York , and I believe , your niece . " " My dear ! " Adelina Moffat pulled up her gown and her image mocked her in a mirror set above a table laden with vials , pots and powder cells . " My dear , how wonderful ! How very wonderful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice suggested the cool perfection of skillfully carved marble . " You 're lovely  --  beautiful . To think we are related ! La ! I vow I 'm flattered  --  " She swept to her feet and came close . " Your name is  --  ? " " Minga . " " How fascinating  --  I do n't believe I have ever before heard it . " A scent , indescribably subtle and quite alluring , enfolded Minga as her aunt suddenly embraced her and pressed lips to her cheek . Though the storm boomed and howled louder than ever , it might have been a serene , starlit evening for all the effect it had on the mistress of Hawthorn Hall . " But you are young  --  so , so beautiful . I  --  I can scarce believe that you are my aunt , " Minga stammered , feeling a sight more like twelve than like twenty . Quite frankly she peered about , became fascinated by the richness of the draperies , by the amazing luxury of this apart- ment situated not a few rods from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undoubtedly of French design  --  green and gold ; dominating the whole chamber was the most monumental bed Minga had ever beheld . Raised by two steps from the floor , it occupied most of the opposite wall and its footboard was fashioned like a great gilded dolphin . A mirror formed its headboard . " I believe , " said Mrs. Moffat , carefully , " that you will find Hawthorn Hall somewhat of a change from  --  what was the name of judge Allen 's  --  your home ? I forget though I did know . Poor Torn used often to speak of it . " " Millwood , " Minga told her . " Please , my dear , sit you down and rest  --  you must be exhausted . " " Oh , thank you . " A warm welcome sense of relief engulfed Minga . Somehow she had been expecting either a withered harpy of a womanor a fat slug . How lucky , how very fortunate , that Adelina Moffatwas young , lovely and dainty as one of those porcelain figures which , off Cape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caribbean.  |p315AFTER  ONE , Two weeks had slipped by , Minga wondered how ever she could have been disturbed by those implications half-expressed by Mr. Hamilton and Kendall , the publican . Reserved , aloof , and disinclined to speak on matters of personal interest , her aunt had proved generous to a fault and , above all , quite devoid of that peculiarly feminine failing  --  curiosity . Yet there were times when Aunt Adelina 's small red mouth took on curves which defied analysis , and she loved to move about her great house clad in scandalously sheer gowns . On hot afternoons the mistress of Hawthorn Hall thought nothing of lying part , or wholly , nude on her great bed  --  pale and perfect as a Grecian statue  --  while Chloe read or sang and a small black boy brushed away chance flies . To Adelina the black servants evidently were less than human , rather like cats and dogs in human form . She would speak as if they were not in existence . The impression grew that some sort of invisible barrier restrained her normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too satisfied to do , apparently , one useful thing . Sometimes for a day or two she would become absolutely inaccessible , her apartment a retreat in which much or little might be taking place for all Minga could tell . The next day she would reappear , gracious , smiling and perfect in every detail . She took an extraordinarily great pride and interest in her coiffure  --  made Chloe spend hours in arranging and rearranging it . Not one room , but a suite  --  powder room , robe room , and bedroom  --  in the far northeast corner of the manor house was assigned to Minga 's use . In it tall , drip-stone water jars tinkled day and night , kept abundant drinking water cool by evaporation . La ! Not even Millwood had been like this . Minga grew to love the tall rooms , the wide , glassless windows , the glistening floors of glowingmock orange and mahogany . Mahogany here was a drug on the market ; even roof supports had been fashioned of the beautiful wood . Adelina Moffat took evident pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cool of the morning she had Chloe fetch dress after dress from cleverly concealed closets , and made Minga , warm and excited , try them on . When one proved unusually becoming , she would say , " It is yours , my dear . " Certainly Sir Thomas Moffat had not stinted his wife in the matter of raiment . He must have been as wealthy as old King Midas , Minga decided . " A pox on so many underclothes , " the widow had burst out one afternoon . " I protest . You 've a figure Artemis herself might envy  --  in this Godforsaken climate one or two will do . " And so Minga had taken , after a few hot blushes , to wearing just a pair of cambric petticoats . " How can I ever thank you ? " she had exclaimed upon the gift of a vivid blue ball gown . Dishevelled from trying on clothes , her slender figure revealed because perspiration had caused her shift and petticoatsto adhere , Minga fairly glowed with excitement . " Do n't try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is reward enough . " Then , for the first time , Adelina seemed to notice the silver and green enamel bracelet , had commented on the clever way the dolphins were intertwined . " A pretty bit of work , my dear . " In Hawthorn Hall a normal day began at the unheard-of hour of five in the morning for the household  --  not for Adelina and herself . Long since she had abandoned the word " aunt . " To continue to employit would have been utterly absurd . Mercy , but it was fine to be cared for once more , to be waited on . In Hawthorn Hall there was food a-plenty , though Mrs. Moffat ' : , overseer , a handsome , dark-browed Jamaican named Henry Thorne , not once but several times had mentioned to his employer the factp317that the estate 's stock of salt fish , salt beef was running perilously low . So , too , was the cattle fodder , previously imported from New York and Philadelphia . One fine morning she and Adelina had gone riding a-horseback and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three oxen lay trembling slowly . It had given Minga an unpleasant turn to see them seek to get up . But they could n't . From the edge of some tall cane blacks , with eyes sunk preternaturally deep in their heads , looked on furtively . " What ails them ? " Adelina had demanded . " Hunger , Ma'am . They 're dying , " Thorne had explained with a slow look at his employer . " We should have bought that corn , no matter what the price . " Adelina Moffat 's bright blue eyes dropped almost demurely . " Of course , Thorne , I suppose I was headstrong . But we ca n't be right ll the time , can we , Minga ? " Struck by an inspiration , the younger woman suggested , " Since ose oxen are practically finished , why not slaughter them and feed ur field hands ? They 're hungry , too ; Chloe told me so . " The two burly bookkeepers who always rode as guards grinned . delina Moffat 's precisely chiseled lips tightened and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tricorn with a jaunty ostrich feather to match . " Alas , my dear , you do n't understand . To feed the slaves meat is invite disaster , revolt . On a diet of meat our slaves , which are mostly Mandingoes and Senegals , become quarrelsome and get age ideas . " When those animals die , Thorne , see that the carcasses are burnt . " The hopeless expressions on the field hands ' faces had troubled nga for quite awhile , but such was the pleasure of living cornably , securely again , she forgot about it . It required almost a month of subtle indications to bring home the tainty , the realization that Henry Thorne was more than just the nager of Moffat 's Penn . Despite a carefully correct manner with ich he invariably addressed the stately blond mistress of Haw- thorn Hall , the Jamaican fell off guard every now and then just the least trifle . As , for instance , that time when Minga had returned to retrieve an embroidery frame from her aunt 's room . Blended shadows had separated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had entered , Adelina Moffat 's primrose-pink complexion had gone a deep rose . In the evenings it was fascinating to listen to island gossip , to hear accounts of the theater in Kingston , where Mr. Hallam 's troupe of American actors had held forth in 1775 ; of great revels over which presided a notorious Mrs. Williams , of the deadly dull official affairs at Government House . There the ladies were excused at ten o'clock , leaving Lord Balcarres and his ilk to get properly drunk before they called for their horses and went galloping off in search of the warm embraces of some mustee . There were many Free Mason lodges in the island , Minga learned , and an elaborate system of militia , very necessary in case of slave uprisings such as had threatened Jamaica no further back than 1774 . Once a year the slaves made truly merry  --  on Boxing Day  --  the day after Christmas . Then the blacks turned out in weird and elaborate costumes to follow their tinsel kings , John Canoe , John Crayfish an Merry Andrew . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves . The island 's monetary system proved an involved business , Min. learned . There were not merely pounds , shillings , and pence . " We have bits worth fourpence , halfpenny , " Henry Thorne tol. her , but his limpid brown eyes clung to Adelina Moffat , lovely in loose gown of apple-green gauze . " Quatties ' worth penny ha'penny Gills ' of three farthings . Macs '  --  at thruppence . Does ' worth fiv pounds , half joes , Macaronis ' from the Presidency of Hondura pistoles , ' ryals , ' and doubloons ' worth two pound ' seven and six . " " A simple matter , " Minga smiled . The three of them , one stiflingly hot twilight , were seated on broad verandah looking northward towards the distant Caribbca watching great banks of rounded white clouds go cruising leisurelyp319off in the general direction of Saint Domingue , Puerto Rico , and Turk 's Island . " The rats are bad again , " the manager commented , setting down his glass of rum and lime punch . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Minga asked , " Why do n't you bring in dogs ? " An ivory fan in Adelina 's slim hand barely checked its even rhythm . " It 's of no use , dear ; always , the slaves either poison the poor brutes or catch them and eat them . " There were other hazards to plantation life , the Jamaican explained . Tom Raffles ants , for instance , which were strong enough to kill poultry and to eat out the eyes of tiny Negro babies . Fire , though , remainedthe greatest hazard . It was an iron-clad law in the island that when an alarm was sounded on a neighboring penn , every available slave must be rushed to the rescue . " Oh , Harry , in Heaven 's name , give over ! " Minga looked up startled . Never before had Adelina employed the familiar form of her manager 's name . This , Minga found , was surprisingbecause , despite his protestations to the contrary , Henry Thorne 's fingernails were a shade too blue at their bases , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pigmentation . For all of that , though , the Jamaican was uncommonly handsome and carried himself like a young lord . " Pray do n't age poor Minga with all that homely talk , " the widow said fanning away an inquisitive fly . " No , please . This is all new to me , " Minga protested . " Mr. Thorne , you were going to tell me how you press the cane ? " Clearly , Thorne was ready to continue . " We have a press powered y oxen , mules , and slaves . Canes are cut in the correct lengths , and fed in between a set of three iron rollers . Compressed , they 're returnedby a dumb retainer for another passage through the three oilers . The juice , thus extracted , falls into a leaden trough which conducts it to a receiver . Cane juice , Ma'am , is eight parts water to one part sugar , one part essential oil , and one part gross oil . "  |p320Alternately  fanning himself with a palm leaf and sipping punch , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second leaden trough into a clarifier , or cauldron , with a capacity of a thousand gallons . Into this , one pint of Bristol lime was added to every hundred gallons of liquor in order to banish acids . Great care , he explained , must be exercised that the liquor did not even come to a boil , that the scum constantly was skimmed off . " From this cauldron the liquor is ladled by slaves of the boiling house gang into a second copper , from thence to a third . Finally , the syrup is ladled into a cooler where what we call striking molasses ' takes place . We make what we call the touch ' by drawing some of the boiling liquor into a thread . " If your thread hardens and breaks , it 's done , " Thorne explained , his broad brown features serious . " For muscovado sugar a quarterinchlong is enough . Perhaps you would care to come out to the fields some morning when the big gang is cutting and tying ? " " Big gang ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Moffat has ninety-odd  --  divided into seven gangs . Ten men cut , ten tie , ten haul ; then there are fifteen bucks on the top heap squad saving cane tops for the cattle , seven slaves to work in the boiling house , two good ones at the stills , six watchmen , and twelve artisans , two hunters , and eight stock minders . " The little gang does light work like hoeing , holing and planting . We need the strongest men in the curing house . That 's the big shed you will see , Ma'am , where the liquor is cooled and stirred . That 's where we add the yeast to make the rum before the brew goes over to the distillers . " " Harry ! I said that was enough ! " It was truly a breathless evening . Maybe that accounted for Adelina'simpatience , but for all that she looked particularly fetching in her pale green gown . Never a trace of perspiration dewed her cheeks or forehead , to Minga 's envious realization . Adelina spoke crisply , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landing . You had better go . " Her vivid blue eyes climbed slowlyp321as the Jamaican heaved a solid , yet lithe , six feet of stature to its feet . Clad in loose white linen that rendered his face darker than ever , he crossed to stand beside the long chair upon which she reclined . " Yes , Ma'am . " " After supper , Harry , I shall expect your report . " " Thank you , Mrs. Moffat . I shall be punctual . " As he bowed the manager regarded Adelina 's slim figure in dumb adoration . God 's blood ! To think that this exquisite , fragile , nearly ephemeral goddess was his ! Brazenly , devotedly , blindly his ! He could n't believe his luck . Kwanshee made those smelly Fula and Mandingo wenches look like stupid black cows . As he turned to quit the verandah , he thought , " Adelina has been kind never to remind me . " He was n't exactly proud of the fact that his grandmother had come over from the Grain Coast aboard a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to " make a report . " Tonight they 'd blend as never before . " Must have been addled to imagine Adelina 's been distant recently , " he reflected . " Maybe I have n't treated her rough enough . What she loves is a paddling and rough talk . Be gentle and polite , and she 's bored . " Wonder if Old Sir Tom 's duppy ever bothers her ? I 'll ask Chloe . No , I wo n't . Chloe is angered at me . A good girl , Chloe  --  but where 's a fellow get , wasting time on a slave ? " He was striding down the great hall now , his heels clicking regularlyover the wild-orange flooring . " If this crop makes up like it promises , " he reflected , " I can hold out near a thousand pounds ore . Thank God , ' Delina 's too damned indolent ever to check gures . Kwee ! No , I must n't use that word  --  it 's slave lingo . " He began smiling . The world was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Delina even half guesses how well I 've got her guinea irds feeding out of my hand ? Some day it 'll strike her , all of a heap , at she 'll do well to marry me . Yellow jack strike that damned mincing macaroni of a George Kinsman ! " Lightly , Henry Thorne swung down the righthand wing of the ! coming-arms stair . Darkness was falling and in the row of book- keepers ' huts lights were beginning to glow . " So ' Delina wants me to come up tonight ? Why was I getting so worried ? She could n't very well have let on to that pretty niece of hers about us  --  not before now . Now take that Allen girl  --  Americans are different . She 's got muscle and a heart too strong for her own good , I fancy . Kwee ! Stab me but I 'd hate to have her crack me ! All the same , the girl is either confounded innocent  --  or slow . Why should it take her so long to understand about  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orange grove , but in the slave village someone was wailing . Another child must be dead of the lockjaw . What a pity nearly every other picanniny took it and perished  --  a real financial tragedy . " Would n't ever have believed ' Delina could hold off so long  --  two whole weeks . Must near have killed her , I guess , except  --  Chloe ? Women are funny . " It will be hard to wait until the house is quiet . Why all this pretensefor the sake of that American ? When will she leave ? It was fine in the old days when ' Delina and me could eat , drink , watch the fun together . " God 's thumb ! He guessed he 'd never get over that saintly , frozen face of ' Delina 's . And what amusing divertissements she could think up . A little on the cruel side . She 'd gone a bit too far with that revel , mid-month last . The manager paused under a huge cottonwood to wipe his face , thoughts flickering like heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King 's birthday this year  --  June 4 , 1778 ? " I told her she ought n't to buy so much powder , " he thought . " Um-m . Whatever chances , King Jack will obey me , but Quarrin ? We 'll watch that old devil . " He 'd heard about what ' Delina had done to Wimba down there in Wine Cellar Number Two . There were floggings  --  and floggings . Once the lattice door had clicked behind the manager 's handsomely proportioned figure , Adelina stopped fanning , turned her almost perfectface . Her breast quivered under the green gauze as she turnedp323to face her guest . " So far , you have not been bored at Hawthorn Hall ? " " Oh ! No , it has been wonderful here . " Impulsively Minga took the widow 's hand . " Why do you ask ? Have I not seemed enchanted ? I am , you know . " Adelina settled back on her cushions . " Life in Jamaica is so often intolerably tedious  --  believe me , seven long years here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaze shifted to a purplish reflection of the sunset in the east . " Oh , Minga , do you suppose I shall ever again hear coaches go rumbling down London 's streets ? I  --  I  --  Until Sir ' T'om 's will is probated , I must linger in this accursed dull island . " She caught her breath and that strange , vitreous quality came to her eyes . " In America , I hear the Red Indians torment their captives  --  " Intently she studied Minga 's ruddy features . " Have you ever heard how ? " " Heavens , no ! " Minga laughed . " When Sir William Johnson commenced to speak on the subject , Papa sent Mother and me a-packing . Why ? " The widow 's fan recommenced its measured beat . " Oh , it 's only that tomorrow Sir George Kinsman will be here to dinner . The  --  the subject is of interest to him . At any rate , my dear , we must see what we can do to amuse him . "  |p324Chloe  was feeling gayer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the day of the Vodu , she 'd been to see the papaloi , devoted celebrant of the Legba rites . Nearly all the slaves on the estate , be they cream , coffee or black , secretly worshipped Ougun Bogradis and Damballa , the one great Serpent God , though dutifully they joined palms on Sunday and bent their heads before the Buckra god . What a great fool was Henry Thorne ! Chloe hated him  --  with the hitter mordant hate of the cast-off , of the deposed . She hated him , clear down to the parings of his finger and toenails . In the grove above the little savanna at the back of Moffat 's Penn the papaloi had done some interesting things with those parings . There , the papaloi had lit candles , donned a scarlet robe and had consulted the Gouede . Was it right that Henry Thorne should throw away her affections like the husk of guinea corn when the cob is cooked ? No . It was not right . The papaloi had said many things  --  strange , frightening things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't wholly believe . The witch-doctor had been born and brought up in Dahomey . Seated in her large and comfortable room , the confidante perceivedthat , greatly as she hated her ex-lover , she hated Adelina Moffat more . She called her mistress Adelina because the widow had ordered her to  --  point blank . To begin with , she 'd been frightenedof such familiarity . Not that ' Delina had n't been good to her , in a manner at once aloof  --  and frighteningly intimate . Sir Thomas had been mightily shocked that time he 'd come veryp325quietly to his wife 's bedroom to find her pouring out a description of her body 's yearnings to a mustee . " I 'll never understand the buckras , " Chloe mused . " Whites  --  the women , I mean  --  freeze up , like they tell about the rivers in America , until something or someone melts them . Then whoosh ! from nothingthere 's too much . " I wonder why the whites ca n't live , ca n't take things more easylike ? Not so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all at once . " Absently the mustee continued to finger her jewels ; some of them were really fine relics of those three gay years spent in Spanish Town where the younger sons of stout English families tried to live a lifetimein a few months  --  before the dreaded yellow jack or putrid fever carried them off from their ships or regiments . The papaloi 's wanger seemed potent , for , if she read the signs aright , Henry was coming back to her , lashed by that scorn of the all-white for the near-white . What would she , Chloe , do then ? In the bright sunlight of the late afternoon she threw back her glossy head . She 'd watch him gasp , slobber for forgiveness , for everything to between them as before  --  and take him back . In a pier glass the slave stared at herself , bit her lower lip and en winked at her image . In what a fool 's paradise did Adelina offat dwell ! The widow , of course , had never dreamt anybody uld ever notice a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t tough and penetrating as iron needles , concealed in the handle a certain fan . Only by the sheerest accident had she , Chloe , noticed c lethal dust concealed in a space designed to contain scent or lip uge . Adelina 's had been a graceful gesture when , with half a dozen people present , she had scattered that fine , but deadly , powder over r ' T'om 's curry . He had doted on the dish and liked it strong enough blister the skin off a bull . Of course , he 'd never noticed the little bamboo fibers . Yes . She held Mrs. Moffat like a bird in a snare , only c did n't suspect . Chloe arose , swung her hips over before a cheval glass , posed there ,  | made pleasant grimaces at herself , then pulled up her dress till it rode about her flat little stomach and inspected her legs . A little plump ? Better not eat quite so much rice . Reseating herself , Chloe pulled out her combs and commenced to do her hair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 'd just finished doing ' Delina 's so it came easy . At length she stood up and smiled at herself in the mirror , while looping a string of pearls and topazes across the crown of her arrangement . The papaloi had predicted Henry and ' Delina would part forever , so she would enjoy the next two weeks  --  watch Henry suffer what she had suffered , for as sure as Damballa ruled sky , sea and land , Delina was tiring of Henry Thorne . Sir George Kinsman was one of ' Delina 's own kidney , and no deacon ; not if even a quarter was true of what the slaves of Lucinea Penn whispered abroad . Skillfully , the mustee applied lip rouge from a pot which Delina would never miss , then real French scent strong enough to drown the day 's accumulation of sweat  --  her fortnightly bath was only a day away now . Why not  --  borrow ? ' Delina had everything  --  and would have it for a while longer . Apparently Sir Tom 's exquisite blond widow had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some bright day she 'd learn how dearly cost were her saddle horses , her brocades , satins , and laces . The hair-do Chloe almost subconsciously had created was flattering . Like the waves from an obsidian sea her tresses swept upwards in sleek undulations . What a rare joke were she to catch Sir George 's eye . He 'd a penchant for mustees ; the whole island was aware of that . ' Chloe giggled . Suppose  --  suppose Sir George were to prefer the lusty , golden-brown of Mistress Allen , to the icicle brilliance of ' Dana ! This American girl was either almighty clever , or so green it wasn'tp327to he believed . Chloe figured , privately , that Minga was far smarter than she was green . A kind sort , though , straightforward and outspoken . She said what she felt , and be damned to you . Americans held that reputation . Queer , though , how it gravelled Mistress Allen when anybody referred to her as " an American . " She could hear Bacchys , the butler , roaring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground doves had begun calling ; the tree frogs , too , were commencing to pipe up . One thing baffled , frightened her a little . From whence did Henry Thorne derive such an amazing influence over the field hands ? He passed for white almost everywhere in Jamaica yet the savage Angolos , Whydas and Senegals worshipped him ; even Grandy , new Colonel of the Maroons , held Henry in admiration . Henry was weak in the head not to tell the widow , ' Delina , about the true state of affairs at Moffat 's Penn . Why , only yesterday out at Flying Penn No. 3 , not one or two , but fifteen slaves had died not of cocobies , or yaws , or flux , but of sheer starvation . Cuffee , head boiler , and Crakadill , still watcher , had gone slipping off into the cane again , even though it would mean forty lashes laid on hard when the patrols caught them , brought them back . Bucko , fierce ex-war-chief of the Coromantees , was looking almost pleased these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd a gun hidden away , was the worst rebel on the estate . Well , enough of that . Chloe was n't any common field hand ; dressed better than ninety out of a hundred white women in the island . Maybe she 'd better stay close to ' Delina ?  --  Better than anyone else she knew what Mistress wanted , how  --  and when . She dabbed rice powder on her throat  --  rice powder with just a speck of saffron in it . In the court below a soft voice began to hum a tune . The words were indistinguishable , but Chloe knew them . " Young officer come home at night , Him give me ring and kisses . Nine months one picaninny white , Him white almost like Missus But Missus lick my back wid a switch . Him say di child for MassaBut Massa say him di child for bitch . " A small clock chimed nine times . Chaw ! She 'd best hustle below . The flowers tonight must be particularly well arranged . Sir George , in his drawling fashion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a saffron-tinted gown with modish paniers bound in pale green ribbon , twisted a necklace of seed pearls around her throat  --  one young Squire Peters of Port Antonio had given her three years ago , the night before he 'd wagered and lost her at pharo to Judge Exelbee Lawford . He in turn had gamed and had lost her to Mrs. Moffat . It was a queer business , this , being owned by a woman . When you belonged to a man you knew straight off how to please him  --  it was simple enough . Arranging some lace edging to her well-filled bodice , she figured there 'd be fun at Hawthorn Hall on the King 's birthday . Henry had got ' Delina to promise a real celebration  --  fireworks and plenty of gunpowder to go bang ! from those old Spanish pieces salvaged from a wreck off Bloody Bay . Henry Thorne knew what he was about . Such a display would quiet murmurings for a while at least . Sir Thomas had certainly made a mistake in buying in so many Coromantees , Senegalese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same stock as the Maroons roaming the Land of Look Behind . Chloe gave her dress a final pat , then fairly galloped downstairs because she could hear horses on the driveway . Already half-naked stable boys were raising shrill cries as they ran to catch the bridles , hopeful that the visiting gentry might toss a few coppers onto the driveway . The riders , sure enough , were Sir George Kinsman and Dr. Belden , the worst doctor and the best gambler along all the northern coast of Jamaica . The latter existed by peregrinating every few weeks from one great sugar estate to another . His stock of medicines was small , but unlimited was his repertoire of ribald songs and jokes such as made even the most hardened islanders color and laugh nervously . Blotched , swollen with high living , he had difficulty inp329dismounting from a dusty , fagged-looking cob . When Chloe appeared at the head of the steps and called , " Good evening and welcome , gentlemen , " Sir George stared , paused in the act of easing his tall gelding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ceres ' daughters . " Though Chloe had not the least idea of who Ceres was , she spread her skirts , swept a graceful curtsy . " ' Pon my word ! " For all he was dusty as any miller , Dr. Belden whipped out a quizzing glass , peered up his ample red nose . " I say , Sir George , who is this ? A Spanish cousin of our hostess ? " " Cousin ? " Sir George bellowed . " Gad ! The fair Moffat will be flattered if not enormously amused to answer you . " The master of Lucinea Penn came swinging up the stone steps , at the same time vigorously slapping the dust from his boots . He used a curious riding crop tipped with a cherub 's golden head . Chloe stayed where she was , well aware that the last glow of sunlightwould warm the golden tints in her skin . Squire Peters often had commented on the phenomenon , had made a practice of sending for her at just this hour of the day . " Welcome , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Belden hawked , spat over the guard rail into the dust , then , much like a hound sniffing its quarry , turned his pointed , red-veined nose in Chloe 's direction . " Well , Sir George , you 've distractions , praise the Eternal ; but as for me , this chick will do . Now then  --  " The scrofulous old rascal started to slip an arm about her waist , but Chloe spun aside , smiling ml not at all ruffled . " La , sir , you are overhasty . " She rolled limpid eyes to mollify im ; then , when still he appeared disgruntled , she fell back a step nd brushed the back of her hand against his . " Have you not heard , Doctor , that wine improves  --  with waiting ? " " And did you hear that ? A witty piece . ' Pon my word , yes . " Dr. ! den was puffing from the steps . " I say , George , what kind of a lace is this ? Here we are , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , damme , not a single confounded drop . " " Oh , please , sir , you are mistook . This way , please . " Yellow skirts swinging , Chloe indicated a small room to the right ; in it Madeira , plunged in wetted saltpetre , should be cooling . Bacchys had done as he should . Said Sir George , smacking leathery lips , " Pray convey my complimentsto Mrs. Moffat , and what time is dinner ? " Chloe said , eyes demurely downcast . " Ten o'clock , a trifle early , I fear . " She lowered her voice to a rich , almost husky pitch . " Mrs. Moffat is impatient . " She managed a quick but fetching look at him . La , she had him going , all right ! His squarish , deeply lined face was suffused , and she felt his fingers grope briefly at her bodice top when the doctor , in his plum-colored riding coat , plunged his features into a bowl of sangaree . She 'd show Henry Thorne . Maybe there 'd be gaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barren , she was worth a lot more than most Creoles and Mrs. Moffat knew it . Moreover , Sir George belonged in the very top drawer of Jamaican society . She could handle an old boar like Dr. Belden with no trouble at all . Besides , he had n't a penny . " I vow , I had no idea Mrs. Moffat possessed such a confidante , " Sir George observed , reaching for a box of Cuban segars . " And where were you the last time I visited here ? " " I 'd forgot to take my bark and was down of a fever , " she explained.  |p331ADELINA  MOFFAT pushed away her plate , reclined on her settee watching a circlet of moths and mosquitoes play about the candelabra set to attract insects to the far end of the verandah . The mosquitoes were n't so bad tonight , thank goodness . All day a wind had been blowing , rushing down from the mountains . For some reason Adelina felt irritable , though her gown was a success and the meal was better cooked than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she would flatter and coquette , perhaps , with Sir George . Critically , she studied Sir George across the candle flame . What a big , masterful brute he looked , all male and fearful of nothing . He was a real devil in a dovecote , too , so the word went . She guessed she 'd never be able to dominate , to cow , to bully him as she did Henry Thorne . Maybe that was what she yearned for , a ruling hand andhot temper that needed watching out for . Under the table she smoothed her new silk stockings . Why should she feel so irritable ? Minga was being her usual charming , forthright self and had capluredthat odious Dr. Belden 's attention . Who but George Kinsman would dare wear red silk heels ? Mm-m a nasty French touch , and yet  --  and yet he wore them with masculineforcefulness . He was so sunburned she guessed Sir George must have been working his estate . For all his devotion to pleasure , the proprietor of Lucinea Penn was no wastrel drone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Sir George . Harry Thorne was competent , in his way , yet he never took the initiative nor came right out and told her what needed to be done , not if it was leastways unpleasant . A curious character , Harry ; but for that taint of Africa he might have risen to a seat on the Governor 's assembly beside Hinton East , Digby Dennis , Jamie Crean , Matthew Wallen and the rest . She watched him talking to Minga in that low-pitched , vibrant voice which , for months , had charmed and fascinated her . An odd creature , Minga , at once soft and feminine , yet she 'd good sense ; did n't shock too easily . It had come as rather a surprise that the American could become so readily inured to the rather brutal life of the Island . Of course , she had n't been out to the outlying villages , had n't seen the gangs working under pressure . One cause of Adelina 's abstraction was the problem of meeting that note of Griggs Barnsby 's . Damn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever had Harry let the estate get so deep in debt ? A sudden suspicion occurred that the manager 's silence might have been deliberate . She fanned more rapidly . Aware that Dr. Belden was repeating an amazingly salacious bit of gossip about a certain Anne Palmer who lived at Rose Hill on the coast , she listened with care . " Come rouse yourself , " she admonished herself , " you must be extra gracious , charming tonight . I say , George  --  " But Sir George did not hear . He was too busy exchanging glances with Chloe . " Have you heard  --  ? " Adelina began , then , when her neighbor remainedabsorbed in the mustee 's conversation , picked up a fork and playfully , but vigorously , jabbed the master of Lucinea on his elbow . " Damn me , " he roared , rubbing his sleeve . " What 's this ? " Adelina 's perfect lips parted slowly and her face was quite serene . " My apologies , Sir George , I fear I mistook your elbow for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so than you should mistake Chloe for your hostess . " He stared , then burst out laughing uproariously . " Touche . My apologies , Adelina . " How could he so have forgottenp333the main chance ? He felt prompted to kick himself . Many and many a hundred hogsheads of sugar had been , and would still be , extracted from the rich black soil of Lucinea . But Moffat 's Penn  --  there was a real estate for you . Together , the two penns would constitute the largest holding on the north coast of Jamaica . Yes . Moffat 's combined with Lucinea should furnish enough revenue to make possible a return to the pleasures of England , of Paris , and of Sicily . Adelina should make as good a running mate as any . The woman possessed charm , looks , breeding , plenty of fire beneath that aloof , too perfect exterior and , if he rightly suspected , more than a moderate fortune . If the wind had n't been blowing the mustee 's perfume and her odd , musky personal aura right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Right in the middle of a sentence he glimpsed her profile , golden in the candlelight  --  and broke off his conversation with Adelina Moffat . On the other side of the table Thorne was saying , " Indeed , MistressAllen , you will find that our mountains are the most beautiful part of Jamaica . Among them it 's cool all day long . And such water  --  you have never seen water like that . " Minga thought of the great clear streams , limpid lakes of America , but said nothing . " Do those mountains mark the edge of the Cockpit Country ? " The manager 's eyes , restless , softly brown like a monkey 's , swung quickly in the candlelight . " The Cockpit  --  yes , it lies on the other side . Why ? " " Oh , coming up from the Coast the man I rode with said thatthe  --  thatthe Maroons were uneasy . He was n't right ? " " I hope  --  " Everyone started at the sudden smashing of Adelina 's glass . Firm , graceful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normally pallid featureshad gone pink and her little mouth had become a crimson cut . She had recognized what had been irritating her all evening . Said she in accents that fairly tinkled with icy rage , " I fear , Sir George , I can not hold your attention until  --  " Deliberately , Adelina Moffat closed her fan and , reaching out , struck Chloe sharply once , across each cheek . Her mask-like expression never altered . The mustee uttered a bewildered cry , flinched back . " Apparently it is not enough , you yellow tart , that you steal my perfume nor is it enough that you dare to rob my lip rouge . It 's that you would have the supreme effrontery to dare to mimic my coiffure ! " The widow 's blue eyes shone so coldly menacing that a shiver ran the length of Minga 's spine . Sir George choked off some comment . It was true . To the last curl Chloe had copied her mistress ' coiffure , had even duplicated the draping of the strand of topazes and pearls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burst out , her eyes filling , " I did n't mean  --  I did n't realize how I  --  " " That will do ! Sit still , you insolent slut ! " Twice more the Englishwoman 's fan impacted against Chloe 's cheek . The first two marks took shape , then the second . Never had Minga seen Adelina Moffat stand so tall , so icily beautiful . The Englishwoman'snostrils were pinched , her cheeks drawn in like those of a person long without food , but her breast was full and erect . " Since my friend Sir George seems to find difficulty in distinguishingus , I propose to remove any possibility of future error . Stand up but stay where you are . " " Yes , ' Delina , dear , " Chloe quavered . Like wax figures in a museum set the guests watched the mustee get to her feet , eyes overflowing and obviously in sheer terror . " Right here and now , " Adelina directed in metallic accents , " you may remove those garments I have been generous  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " No ! No ! You would n't  --  " The mustee backed away from the candles . " Bacchys ! " The widow 's voice reverberated on the verandah like the crack of a lash . " Call Cudjo and Aneas ! " " Oh , no , please  --  " Minga experienced at once a sense of revolt ,  |p335and  an overwhelming impulse to witness what might happen . " Any of you may leave , if you so desire , " the widow told her guests , the candles sketching tawny tints amid the silver sheen of her highdressedhair . " From this spot , " chortled Dr. Belden , " you could n't budge me with a span of steers . Madame , pray proceed . " Sir George was thinking , " You 're a lucky dog , George my lad . You 'll see this baggage stripped without buying her so much as a string of brass beads . " Henry Thorne was thinking , " She asked for trouble . You 've grown too arrogant , Chloe . Be humble , dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of creation dance to a colored man 's tune . Pay for your arrogance , now , though . Have n't seen you bare in months . " At the entrance to the house appeared two towering blacks . Adelina turned deliberately , said , " Well , Chloe , will you obey my orders ? " Minga felt cold fingers explore the length of her back . She ought to do something , she knew , but stillCudjo , a bull-necked , barrel-chested Fula who acted as footman , started in . " No , I 'll do it myself . " A new thought struck Chloe . She gripped the hem of her gown in both hands , pulled . The fabric gave with a soft snarling sound . The candles wavered and blinked as piece after piece of cloth ripped and yielded . " She 's too shrewd , " thought Adelina Moffat . " The yellow whore is parading herself . " " Stop ! " Only the confidante 's shift remained . " Bacchys ! Show these gentlemen her brand . " Because he was very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking orders from this mustee . He spun Chloe about , ripped her shift down to her waist . Low below the left shoulderblade shone the smooth white scar the branding iron had left long years ago . It was shaped like a small heart ; Dr. Belden recognized it for the brand of Adrien Hart of Kingston . There was an owner who believed in marking his property.  | Stately , calm and frigid , Adelina seated herself . " Chloe , you may serve the dessert . " Completely aghast , Minga could say or do nothing when , sobbing softly , the mustee commenced to clear the table . She had n't a penny and , if Adelina Moffat cast her out right now , she 'd be in a hard case . Since the serene days of Millwood , she 'd learned a lot . Yet she felt an immense pity for Chloe tottering about on trembling legs , passing dishes of pineapple , star apple , custard , and sherbet . Sir George now had no eyes for Chloe , only for the mistress of Hawthorn Hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiling outwardly , but Dr. Belden viewed Chloe with fat lips loose about a pale and very long segar.  |p337FOR  A long while Minga lay awake , tense , perspiring heavily on that great four-poster , which at first had awed her . Beyond the mosquitobar a pair of fireflies cruised about . Quite easily , she could see them haloed through the muslin . Her thoughts were n't on the insects . She was thinking about the expression on Adelina 's face when Chloe stood wailing against the verandah wall , a silver tray and a pair of green slippers all that differentiatedher by way of garments from any bare-bottomed picaninny in the slave village . It had been nothing short of devilish so to humiliate the confidante ; so unfair to elevate a slave to the status of an intimate and then , all in the matter of a few moments , to push her spinning from the heights down to the depths from which she had never really escaped . Had Adelina always been the way she was tonight ? Probably not . How could she ? By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town where , doubtless , she had learned her catechism and deportment . Minga turned over . She could n't remember another evening so terribly hot , an atmosphere so completely devoid of energy . All at once her eyes flew wide open , stared into the dark . Somewhere off in the foothills was sounding a faint , hollow tunk , tunk-to-tunk ! Tunk ! Eerily , the rhythm reverberated among various ridges and valleys , but the sound was so far away it presented no immedicate concern.  | How dare any slave  --  of course , it must have been a slave  --  defy the law against drumming ? Except on a few rare occasions , such as cropover , the beating of drums , even hand drums , was illegal . All too easily did the reverberations of a drum evoke long forgotten emotions , savage memories ; worse still , disrespect for the laws of King George III . Thorne had explained in detail , one sultry afternoon , just what drums did to the black exiles . She wondered what Chloe might be thinking right now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before people without a stitch of clothes must have burnt worse than Mr. Hart 's hot iron . " Minga , my dear , " she whispered as , from time to time , the drum continued to mutter under that green rampart of mountains dividing the coast from the Cockpit Country , " you 'll not sit in judgment on Jamaicans and their ways . Like Massachusettsers , they 've their own peculiar way of life . Probably Adelina was right to mortify Chloe so indecently . I expect plenty of owners would have had her whipped for her impudence . " Again she turned on the bed , her nightgown clinging stickily . " Still , my dear , we are not Jamaicans and we do n't enjoy such scenes . " How could she go away ? If only the Evergreen had n't foundered , how different life would have been . A plague take Andrew Warren ! " I wish I  --  " she started to say , but broke off and lay with eyes shut so tight that little fiery points arched across them under their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guarded inquiriesconcerning doings at Montego Bay elicited no information at all . To all intents and purposes the luckless sea captain seemed to have dropped from sight . In a way this was a relief . Had Andrew been caught and hanged , everybody within a hundred miles would have known . Still , he might have been taken , secretly transported for trial at Port Royal , the King 's great Naval depot at Kingston . Why , he might this moment once more be fighting against his King , and yet  --  and yet  --  Oh dear , why must such persistent memories of him come to torment her ? Angrily , she pushed her damp pillow into a new shape.  |p339No  , she warned herself , it would n't do to dwell any longer on the subject of the New Englander . Certain mannerisms of his clung to her memory . There was that swift , yet graceful , gesture with which he turned his head , always with a little upward movement . When perplexed , his forefingers would pinch his lower lip into a little trough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use his hands to emphasize his speech . Had she caused his imprisonment ? How awful if her cries had condemned him to moulder in some dreadful island jail ! Poth Thorne and Chloe had described various Jamaican prisons with harrowing attention to details . Finally the drums fell silent and the vindictive whining of mosquitoesprying at the muslin cover sounded louder as a result . Yes , she must leave Hawthorn Hall , Minga decided . There was no other way out ; a great pity , because she was lazy enough to love this luxurious way of life . If it had only been beautiful instead of cruel . All of a sudden her eyelids flew wide apart . Down the hall a door had opened cautiously . Aided by that preternatural keenness of hearinggranted to those afflicted with sleeplessness , she detected the quick , soft impact of bare feet . It flashed across her mind that Chloe might have decided to settle a score . Minga slid out of bed as quietly as possible , ran and opened her door a crack . After all , Adelina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side table a single candle , protected by tempest glass , was fluttering . Sir George Kinsman was standing , very tall and disheveled , before the door to his room . He wore a long cambric nightgown and his tawny sunburnt hair tumbled loose over wide shoulders . He was smiling as a golden ray of lamp light marked the closing of Adelina Moffat 's door . Chilled , Minga eased her door shut and was about to climb into bed once more when , beyond her window shutters , there materializeda stealthy shadow . It drifted by , following that gallery which encircled the whole house . The unknown halted before the porch entrance of Mrs. Moffat 's room.  | Thoroughly alarmed , Minga opened her own lattice door , but as quickly flinched back into the dark . Voices , subdued , yet perfectly audible , came floating along the gallery . " What is it you want ? " demanded Adelina 's clipped English voice . " You , " replied the deeper , more vibrant tones of Henry Thorne . " That is over and done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand for it , " the manager burst out . " I love you , too dearly , ca n't you understand ? " " What has been has been , and now it is finished . You may go . " Thorne commenced to plead and such a dreadful urgency entered his tone that Minga felt her cheeks go hot . She 'd no business eavesdroppinglike this ; she knew it , yet stayed right where she was . " But , Kwanshee , my own Kwanshee , one does n't cut off love like a weed . One ca n't . Kwanshee , please  --  I  --  need you . " " Keep your hands away . " Thorne 's voice and manner changed . " You are very clever , Kwanshee , almost as clever as you are beautiful . " " Please go . " " No , you had better listen , Kwanshee . Long ago , your very clevernessserved as a warning to me . I have foreseen this and have taken care that you shall not , will not , dare break with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rush of the distant Montegocascading over a series of miniature falls could distinctly be heard . " What did you mean by that , Harry ? " Adelina was speaking as if she had selected and tested every word before using it . A soft eagerness returned to the manager 's voice . " I hope I shall never have to explain . Come ! Kwanshee , let me make  --  " " Thorne , I have had enough of this ! " Adelina snapped . " Go back to your room and tomorrow  --  " Minga saw the overseer 's powerful body straighten spasmodically . He was breathing heavily as he snarled , "  --  And tomorrow you will be what you are now  --  a chill-hearted murderess ! " The staccato sound of a slap echoed into the dark . " You lyingp341black dog ! How dare you invent such a falsehood ? " " I dare , because I intend to keep you ! If I ca n't have you , Kwanshee , you may be certain that neither Sir George , or others of his kidney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to each other . " The feeble wailing of some sick child in the slave quarters assumed importance in the tense quiet . Presently , in a clear , calm voice Adelina said , " Perhaps you are right , Harry . We have been happy together in pleasure  --  and in pain . I 'll chance that it 's better that we  --  that we keep things as they are . " The voices died away on the porch and a lattice door shut . Lord 's mercy ! Whoever would have dreamed that anyone so lovely , so silver pure-looking , so neat and clean couldMinga felt a sense of nausea churn at the bottom of her belly . Adelina had n't really wanted Henry Thorne . Her next reaction was one of fear  --  of sharp misgiving . Adelina had been frightened into yielding . Why ? Murderess ? Nonsense , of course . Every year in Jamaica hundreds of people died suddenly and naturally . Lying there floundering in a mental maelstrom , Minga commenced to understand many other matters . Henry Thorne was smart , just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who controlled the finances , who shaped the policies of the estate . It was to him that half a thousand slaves gave obedience , not to the widow , Adelina Moffat . It now had become imperative that Minga find an excuse and , more difficult still , the means of leaving Hawthorn Hall . Next morning , on the surface , nothing had been altered . Sir George Kinsman and Dr. Belden slept late , arose and grouchily departed . From a glance exchanged by Adelina and her neighbor , Minga was ready to wager that their parting would be anything but long . " Oh , how I hate to see them leave , " Adelina sighed as she and her niece stood on the stoop watching the riders trot off down the palm-lined drive . She looked extremely dainty this morning in a ink sacque and pale blue skirt . Her silver-hued hair had beenranged in such precise curls that it resembled chasing on a pitcher.  |p342Tiny  bluish shadows lurked under her eyes , however . " Did you not deem Sir George delightful , my dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the least interested in me . " " He had best not be , " Adelina 's laugh tinkled in the hot morning air . " It is I whom Sir George is to admire , as that witless Chloe discovered . Oh , by the bye , I have decided to restore her to grace . Please say nothing when she appears at dinner . She is , after all , without education ; just a little animal . " The widow threaded an arm , smooth and cool as silk , through Minga 's . " And now , my dear , let us stroll down to the orangery . " Adelina commenced to talk more freely than ever before . " On His Majesty 's birthday I intend to have a real fete for the Estate . I have sent to Kingston for bunting and masks and gilt paper and all manner of nonsense . " She frowned abstractedly , twirled a tiny parasol edged with lace . " Thorne informs me that this has been a bad year for the cane . Drought in May and many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blacks need cheering up . Well , we shall feed them well this week , sha n't we ? But I count on the fireworks display to please them most . " Preparations went forward and Adelina ordered that , on the morrow , dozens of favored slaves be ordered in from the outlying penns to witness the celebration . " Tonight I have some tedious plantation matters to discuss , " the widow announced as they regained the coolness of the great hall and Minga sought a cup of water from the nearest drip jar . " Perhaps you would like your dinner in your room ? " For several reasons Minga accepted the suggestion with readiness . " I hope , my dear , that you never become mistress of a sugar estate . " A trifle searchingly Adelina 's bright blue eyes dwelt on Minga and not without affection . She caught her breath , said suddenly , " I have come to the conclusion , Minga , you will do well to visit England . " Adelina was in one of her rare moods when once she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! If this was n't a flawless solution to the problemsraised last night.  | " England ! Oh , but that 's impossible  --  you know it is . I 'd love  --  " She spread her hands . Adelina smiled , taking her hand . " Money will be found . Are n't you my own niece ? Sir Thomas set aside a sum for such purposes . " For all her moral lapses , Adelina Moffat could n't really be so bad . Most likely Sir Thomas had died of natural causes . Everyone knew black people were very prone to exaggerate . In that semi-circular library which had been Sir Thomas ' especial pride , Adelina seated herself and picked up a month-old copy of the Jamaica Royal Gazette . Lips pressed , she seemed to make hard work of her reading , but at length she smiled . " There 's a packet for London from Liguanea this Wednesday a week , " Adelina announced . " I shall book you a cabin . Probably the packet is fast enough to outrun most pirates or privateersmen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Hush , hush ! " The widow raised a fragile semi-translucent forefinger . " You have demonstrated uncommon good sense , my dear , in understanding us here at Hawthorn . I felt as you when first I came out from England  --  yes , I , well , I was much like you , but with time and with the heat , I presume we absorb some of the brutishness of the slaves . ' T is an old saying in the Sugar Islands that , with each passing day , master and slave grow more alike . "  |p344IN  A SILVER and vermilion negligee Adelina Moffat lolled on her chaise longue in the sitting-room of her suite , a slipper dangling from her toe , a slim cigarro between slim fingers . Not in a long time had Henry Thorne appeared quite as appealing as tonight when he had bent to kiss her on the mouth . His wellformedfeatures looked sharpened by his long day of riding about the penn , and that white smile of his almost set her heart to beating as before . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet , and was smoking , studying the amber depths of his brandy glass . His saffron yellow shirt , open at the neck , revealed a wide , hairless expanse of softly brown skin . Deftly Adelina flicked the ash of her cigarro into a small silver urn . " You are right , Harry , we do belong together . " " I am so very happy you feel so , " he said quietly . " I have been worried , Kwanshee . Sir George is rich while I  --  I have only myself to give . " He fixed on her intense , spaniel-like eyes . " Oh , my darling , I could n't live without you and I mean what I say . " " There is no need , " she told him softly . " I just wanted to make you jealous , Harry . Come , there 's a lamb , and kiss me . " Quivering , he drew away at last . She lifted her glass , thought hard . " You are very observant , you know , Harry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was you first wonderedabout Sir Tom ? " He paused , his glass half way to his lips . " The day I found that endp345of dry bamboo in your boudoir  --  only a week after I 'd told you about the Congo trick . " Through the smoke lazily curling about the sitting room , Thorne smiled , a curious angry smile . " I could have stopped you then for I guessed what you intended  --  " " Why did n't you , Harry ? " " I wanted you , Kwanshee , more than anything on this earth and  --  well , Sir Thomas was a barrier . " The hum of insects in the formal garden below sounded very loud . Thorne settled back and put his feet up , eyes fixed on the toes of that little bare foot from which Adelina 's slipper had fallen . " I could have held back your hand that night at dinner so I must be a murderer , too , sweeting , because I let you spill the powder . You were very clever . " " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , her lips barely moving . He hesitated on the verge of telling Adelina that Chloe , too , had seen it all . Poor Chloe . Thorne suspected the mustee must still be in love with him . God , how mortified she 'd been , scarlet with shame . Sir George and the doctor had enjoyed the affair mightily . He 'd better be wary of Chloe , though . She seemed to hate him with an intense , subtle hate . He ended by saying nothing , only kissing that small mouth which , for near on a year , had been sweet as the hope of Paradise . The way Kwanshee responded to the caress removed that last doubt which , all evening , had dug at his peace of mind like a broken fingernail . " Oh , Harry ! Harry ! " she was breathing , " I 'll never be so silly again . No never  --  " Presently she sighed . " Harry , find me some of the really old cognac . " Light as a leopard , Harry crossed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No . No , the bottle there was sealed with an old and cry dusty wax . He felt angrily ashamed of himself . When he had finished drawing the cork Adelina was standing before a full-length mirror , luxuriously combing that wonderful silvery hair of hers into glistening gonfalons . They shimmered clear down to her thighs . The reflection lent double enchantment . Some overwhelming power drove him to kneel and kiss her hand as he had in the exquisitely happy days when , in Hawthorn Hall , only two people had mattered . Looking down and sliding fingers through his glossy hair , Adelina experienced a throb of compassion . Heavens ! Harry was actually grovelling for all he was strong enough to break her into a dozen pieces . So handsome  --  and he passed for white . How could he have kept her secret so long ? Well , he had her dead to rights ; no mistake about that . The courts would n't take a light view of what she had done . Gradually , the realization dawned that she was quite as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was at hers . Probably , to start with , he 'd be restrained in the exercise of his hold , but after the first quarrel he 'd not resist a reminder . Then , more clearly , he would perceive his advantage . " Harry , " she said , brushing fingertips down his cheek , " I feel like singing . Pour yourself a good measure while I fetch the little guitar . " She disappeared through a shimmering white drapery which divided the sitting-room from the bedroom , effortlessly , like a star into a cloud . Thorne eased his belt , smiled at his reflection , then poured himself a stiff three-fingers of cognac and tossed it off . Whew ! This brandy was strong , near twice as potent as Jamaica rum . This kind of rum , he remembered , was made from grapes , not sugar cane . He felt better , though  --  a lot better , and extended himself on Kwanshee 's chaise longue . The bold course , that was always the best . What a fool he 'd been . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last month , and why ? Kwanshee had been so quietly terrified while he had recited his knowledge . Silently Adelina reappeared , held out a restraining hand . " No , sweeting , stay there . " Amid a swirl of azure draperies she seated herself on the footstool , delicately , like a thrush on a bough . " Heavens ! Harry , you have finished your cognac already ? Pour me some . " He obeyed , then refilled his own glass . God 's thumb . She 'd donned a scent he 'd never smelt before  --   |p347Adelina  struck a chord , sang , " El Viento Lo Me Dijo , " a lilting Spanish song from the nearby island of Cuba . She played not well , nor not badly , either . Thorne smiled happily when the cognac commenced to " spread out , " as the Yankee sea captains had put it before the war changed everything . God above , with New England privateers ravaging the Caribbean like winter wolves , what was going to happen in Jamaica this winter ? Stock fish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheat had gone out of sight in price , or just were n't to be had . To hell with slaves , slave food and such . Kwanshee was singing again  --  as in the old days . How indescribably lovely Kwanshee was , outwardly . But inside , she became another being  --  a creature of writhing lips , gorged eyes and sudden fierce ideas . He raised himself on an elbow , peered adoringly into the pallid perfection of her features . In years not a ray of full sunlight had touched them for more than a few moments . Every once in a while , when Kwanshee was playing some particularlyspirited passage , a small rattling noise was audible , but he was too thoroughly content to conjecture on its origin . Gradually the candles burned down , and between lingering embraces , Adelina sang , very softly , certain tunes she knew he liked . Every once in a while she would stop , sip from a miniature liqueur glass . The gold of the candlelight deepened and , as , if to render the moments flawless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to flutter the enormous white silk curtains . Adelina 's pet monkey roused in its basket , yawned a ridiculously human yawn , squeaked drowsily , and went back to sleep . Thorne lay on the chaise longue , his muscled chest bared to the refreshingair currents . Surely life could hold nothing more than this . Plenty of food , good liqueur , a clever , tender mistress  --  musicAdelina 's fingers fell away from the little guitar strings . She rearrangedthe garish green and yellow ribbons on its neck . Then , gentle as a kitten 's paw , they wandered over his forehead to caress his temples.  | " Kwanshee ! " Blindly his hands crept upwards , groping . Here , thought Harry Thorne , is peace , for the first time in weeks . It had been a long day on horseback . Must have ridden twenty , maybe thirty miles ? His eyelids surrendered to the downward pressure of fatigue . " Should n't have spent so much time at Flying Penn Number Three , but I 've got to find out who did that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Leander , too . Do n't fancy the situation . Grandy , the new Colonel in the Cockpit acts too big for his breeches . Do n't want Kwanshee 's land overrun  --  everything 's changed . Might n't it be wise to send to Montego Bay for a squad of soldiers ? Even a few redcoats will have a sobering effect on rebels like BlewholeFred and Leander . God , but this was comfortable . Kwanshee 's breath , fragrant as a mountain breeze , stirred gently against his forehead . Thorne 's breathing deepened , slowed . Against the pale yellow upholsteryof Adelina 's settee , the manager suggested a figure skillfully wrought of bronze . Adelina lit a fresh cigarro , and in the mirror watched her image poise it . Harry was relaxed , smiling , eyes closed . If she got to her feet would Harry waken ? He had ever been a light sleeper . On her stool she sat quite still , five , ten minutes , sketching changing patterns in cigar smoke , thinking  --  but not too far . Somewhere in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He did n't rouse . " Harry ? " she murmured . Then louder , " Sweeting ? " His eyelids did not stir . The sound of her voice she guessed must be soothing . Gradually Adelina leaned forward until her fingertips wavered a scant fraction of an inch from his chest , bare where his shirt had fallen open . She leaned forward and , gradually , her lips flattened against her teeth . Why , one could watch the gentle palpitation of his skin just below the sternum . Carefully Adelina Moffat shifted the footstool and her hand slipped into the guitar between its strings , reached into the interior . It was n't a large knife she brought out and , because an Arab hadp349designed it , its grip was small . The steel blade shone blue-white even though the candles gave off golden hues . Strange characters etched in gold glowed on the upper part of the straight , double-edged blade . Oddly enough , she wished that Sir Thomas were here ; above everything else , Tom had admired courage . Because Harry was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her reflection caught her attention . She would not be suspected . Sir George would see that the matter was taken care of . It would be easy enough to prove there was colored blood in Harry . Employing great care she placed the guitar on a chair behind her , then shifted the knife so that its slim , six-inch blade emerged from the top of her fist . A Cuban had shown her , once , how a real knife fighter employed his weapon . How shiny Harry 's skin was  --  down from the nipple and three inches left  --  the heart lay much nearer the center of the body than most people supposed . In almost a single gesture Adelina stepped out of the negligee , tossed it well away  --  no stains to explain  --  skin washes readily . As an afterthought Adelina tossed her hair back over her bare shoulders . The widow drew a deep breath , straightened her arm until arm and knife were like a lance , then threw her whole weight behind her shoulder . After a split second 's resistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the rapping had been repeated for several moments that Minga roused herself . " A moment  --  wait a moment . " She struck flint and steel to tinder , lit a taper . " Minga ! Quickly please ! " It was Adelina 's voice . " What is it ? " Minga flung open her door , guarded the taper 's flame against an inrush of wind . The widow 's pale hair was streaming wildly , eddying to her movements . " A terrible thing has happened ! " She entered hurriedly , clutching to her a negligee of vermilion and silver silk . " Calm yourself , Adelina dear , " Minga begged after pushing shut the door . " What 's wrong ? " The widow sank onto a chair , covered her face , ignoring the fa that her negligee had fallen apart , to betray that no nightgow covered the white perfection of her figure . " Tell me , Adelina , what 's wrong ? " The widow caught at Minga 's arm . " I was restless after checkin : up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air , I sa a light in my sitting-room beating through the lattices of the door I had n't noticed it before , because , as you know , I always lock my bedroom door . " The last traces of Minga 's drowsiness departed mighty quick . There was no doubt that something of an appalling nature had happened.  | " Oh , Minga , from under that door was creeping blood  --  a stream of it . " Adelina 's palms slowly slipped over her face , framing its colorless outline . " Chloe ? " Minga whispered . " No , Harry  --  Harry Thorne . He 'd stabbed himself . " " Oh , Adelina , how terrible ! How perfectly appalling ! You 're sure lie  --  he 's dead ? " " Oh , yes . There can be no doubt of it . " " But why , why should he have done it ? " The Englishwoman shook her head helplessly . " I do n't know except that there are some account books scattered about . Before I retired he told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was true enough , Minga knew , from what Chloe had let drop from time to time . " It 's my belief , Harry saw no hope  --  feared my reproaches . I have trusted him implicitly . I wonder  --  could he have been stealing ? " Minga could n't make out Adelina . That she was obviously shaken to the depths of her being was very apparent . " How needless , how pitiful . Poor , poor Harry , " she muttered . " If only this stupid war had n't cut off our trade with America ! " They sat quite still , holding each other 's hands . Finally Minga squared her shoulders . " Well , I suppose we must arouse someone . " " Yes , it would never do for one of the servants to make the discovery . Minga , dear , hurry  --  fetch Mr. McCabe , the senior bookkeeper , " Adelina cried , and flung herself , face down , on the bed . I am too undone . Tell him quietly , though , and have him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Minga twisted her chestnut hair into a knot , then pulled on her ppers . " Keep up your courage , I will be back directly . " At the foot of the worn staircase a shadow materialized . It was Moe , barefoot and wearing a simple dress of striped seersucker . u carried a small bundle . " Please , Mistress Allen , " the mustee whispered fiercely , " I 've someingto tell you . "  |p352To  ANDREW WARREN it seemed somewhat incredible that over two months had passed since he had raced , panting , through the dark and twisted streets of Montego Bay with the clamor of a pursuing mob perilously close behind . Barely in time had he found sanctuary amid the goods spoiling in the depths of Mr. Allerdice 's warehouse . Out of caution , he had made himself known only on the third day when stark starvation was nipping his stomach . No telling what Mr. Allerdice might conceive to be his duty . The old Scot , however , had lent him every possible assistance and then some ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's search there was nothing for Andrew to do but to spend two interminably hot weeks among the rats in the warehouse . He employed it reading , studying texts on the art of gunnery . To set foot outdoors in daylight would have been the rankest folly ; at least not until his beard , coming in thick , black and curly , grew long enough to alter the contours of his face . At length Mr. Allerdice deemed it safe for the fugitive to stir abroad , but only duringthe heat of the day when nearly everyone lay asleep . " It 's in the country districts yell run yer greatest risks , " the Scot predicted . " A stranger there stands out like a corbie against the cliffs o ' Dover . " It was suffocatingly hot this early August evening , and perspirationdripped off Andrew 's elbows in runlets as he sat at the table , chewing the old Scot 's dish of meagre supper of yams , fish and bammie cakes . Nov that events appeared to be shaping into a morep353hopeful pattern , Andrew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from prison tomorrow , still madder than hops over having been clapped into jail for punching the ears of an insolent seaman out of H.M.S. Tigress . According to Mr. Allerdice , the experience had gone a long way to diminish the brawny mate 's affection for the Crown and such officers as represented His Majesty in Jamaica . Tomorrow , too , Joe Beaver should return from one of his mysterioushunting trips up into the mountains . It was towards the end of Andrew 's first week of self-imposed imprisonment that the Indian had appeared , fat and pleased-looking , before Mr. Allerdice 's crumblingwarehouse . Not much by way of real conversation with the Penobscot was possible , although the half-breed had picked up some French  --  a language which he believed to be his father 's . Through that medium Andrew learned much in few words . After his initial journey among them , the Penobscot , it seemed , had found Jamaican forests , streams , and game irresistible . In short order he made a bow and manufactured some arrows . The game , high in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of his returns to Montego Bay . It was no trick at all to keep himself well supplied with food . As time went on Andrew deduced that the little bandy-legged halfbreedhad , in some inscrutable manner , won the friendship of a clan of Maroon hunters . This was readily understandable , Mr. Allerdice explained , because most of these villains had more than a dash of Indian blood persisting from the days when the Dons had ruled over the island . Andrew , of course , found time to undertake a deal of thinking , to reappraise himself ; also , to make plans . He believed he had arrived on such a plausible scheme , it was hard to wait . But wait , he must , even though up in Connecticut the Trumbull , frigate , should be all but ready for commissioning . It was wearing , galling to his always impatient spirit , to suffer this inactivity . Yet precautions were necessary . The British Crown had a long memory , particularly in the matter of suspected spies.  | And everywhere were natives eager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money posted for the capture of " One Andrew Warren , Notorious REBEL and SPY . He gives out to hail from Long Island in New York . Very tall , black hair and eyes . Notice of his presence is giv'n to any Magistrate of this Colony . " " Well , lad , I note ye 've a better appetite this eve , " Allerdice observed , belching softly over the last of his supper . " And I have reason . " " Aiblins , but ye 'd best stay away frae yon prison . Ye 've been noticed . ' " Andrew considered the old man askance , ended by smiling thanks . " I will heed your advice , Jamie , and stay away . Did you note the prize , a schooner which made port today ? " " Aye . A Yankee-built vessel wi ' a dark green streak . " The Scot tossed his old dog some scraps , heedless that the grease on them stained the floor . " That 's the one . " Ever so clearly Andrew could see her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wanted because a few hands could handle her and in any weather . She looked fast and provided she was n't tender , just the ship for his purpose . Building for speed , at the cost of sturdiness , was a mistake too many New England shipwrightswere making nowadays . In Portsmouth , Salem , Boston and Nantucket they 'd design a craft on modified French lines  --  somethingfaster than a shooting star in a moderate breeze  --  but come on a real gale any sailing master in his right mind would have to strike canvas or risk turning turtle . The latter fate had overtaken the Trident out of Norwich and the Pacific , laid down and built in Ipswich in Massachusetts . Drowned most of their crews . Of course , any vessel with a name like Pacific would , indubitably , have met with a sad fate . Any mariner would tell you it was begging for trouble to name a ship after any of King Neptune 's oceans . Only superstition , Andrew reflected , yet it was curious how many vessels named for oceans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jared Beetle be trusted ? Andrew wondered . The giant wasp355a consummate sailing master , capable of coaxing every fraction of a knot out of a ship . He could handle men , too . That Mr. Beetle knew little or nothing of gunnery made no difference . A certain officer of the Continental Navy should be able to command that department . His plan must take shape quickly , though . Montego Bay jail had become so jammed with captive American crews , that the principal keeper had taken to permitting such prisoners as desired to sleep in the courtyard . The courtyard Andrew had studied , knew that it was surrounded by a twelve-foot stone wall thickly crowned with glistening , razorsharpshards of broken glass . Everything depended upon the date a certain prison ship would arrive to convey the captive crews around the island to the dreary Naval prison at Port Royal . She was expected any day now . Andrew pushed aside his bowl of tea . " Were you able to secure  --  what I wanted ? " The old merchant , cleaner and with some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I bought twa uniforms off a rogue of a sergeant out o ' the mulatto militia from Port Antonio . I 'm ' feared the tunics are a wee bit sma ' for a mon o ' yer inches . " " They 'll have to do . And the muskets ? " " Yell have the weepons come night . " Allerdice sighed , stared mournfully out of the grimy window . " Oh , Andrew , Andrew ; ' t is a fearsome bold attempt ye 've in mind . " This was true enough . There existed dozens of reasons why a fatal mischance might befall the attempt . Still , reinforced by a crew from the jail , plus Beetle , Joe Beaver , and Atherton ,  --  the last , so Beaver stated , had found sanctuary in a fishing village near Bloody Point  --  the schooner might be put out successfully . Fore-and-aft , that rig was hardier , more efficient in beating to windward , a weak point with most of His Britannic Majesty 's cruisers . If the medicines were to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplished by sitting around , stewing in this musty old warehouse.  | During his concealment Andrew learned in greater detail what the war was meaning to Montego Bay , to Jamaica and to all the British West Indies for that matter . The stagnation in the ports was terrific , despite cargoes unloaded from the captured merchant ships and offered at auction by the King 's vendu masters . Nov that King Louis XVI 's subjects had engaged their ancient enemy yet again , many French prizes commenced to make port . In the taprooms circulated rumors of French raids at St. Eustatis , on St. Kitts , and on Grenada on the outer Antilles ; it was rumored that , from Saint Domingue and Martinique , the French government was putting to sea a swarm of cruisers , privateers with lettersof-marque ; swift , graceful vessels so well built , so cleverly conceived that when some of them were taken the Admiralty yard masters would copy the prizes in shameless detail and use them as models for English men-of-war . At Cape Francois in Saint Domingue , General Count Charles Hector @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly thirty ships of the line and God knew how many frigates , razees , brigs , sloops and transports . Dieu de Dieu ! The might of His Most Christian Majesty , Louis the Sixteenth , would with the help of the Continental Forces drive the British out of America in jig time . " Eh , Jock , what is it ? " Mr. Allerdice 's dog , fatter , lazier than ever , had raised his battered head . Andrew 's eye flickered to a certain tobacco jar which held no tobacco at all but a pair of fine French pocket pistols . He changed their priming every other day . When the dog only snuffled , failed even to interrupt his asthmatic breathing , Andrew relaxed . At the door sounded no knock but a faint scratching . So ? Joe Beaver , it appeared , had anticipated his promised return by one day . Why ? Had the Indian lost count of time ? No , it was uncanny how accurately the Penobscot kept track of time , though he could neither read nor write . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door , shot back itsp357bolts  --  but kept on a guard chain  --  and muttered , " Who 's there ? " " Tomakwe  --  Beaver . " The dog , who loved the Penobscot 's powerful body odor , got up , waddled forward , tail wagging . Joe Beaver entered the room as quietly as a deer entering a windfall . It was remarkable , how surprisinglyhe had reverted to his earlier ways . Gone were his heavy seaman 's breeches ; his broad , brass buckled belt now supported a long knife and a loin clout of some dull green cloth . He had a single , brilliant blue feather lashed into a plait of hair over his left ear . Because the Penobscot quartermaster no longer wore a shirt , the two white men could see how the red-brown expanse of Beaver 's hairlesschest glistened with an application of some oil which was anything but fragrant . In his left hand the half-breed was lugging a skin sack of some sort . " G'night , " he grunted , but his penetrating jet eyes roved about . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread his bag on the table and methodically untied a thong . " Pretty , heir ? Bien jolie ? " He indicated a pair of copper bracelets , the cleverly cured skins of some birds such as neither Andrew nor the Scot had ever seen . In the candlelight they fairly blazed with color . Grinning , Beaver spread for inspection the soft **26;7594;TOOLONG of some animal which , for the life of him , Andrew could not identify . Mingled indiscriminately with these was a heel of bread , a greasy chunk of meat , some papayas , two or three bruised bananas , a fishing line , a cake of salt , and a set of long , evil-appearing , band-fashioned iron arrowheads . In silence the Penobscot accepted the bowl of food the old merchantoffered , commenced to stuff his mouth . Indianlike , he disdainedfork or knife , ate with his fingers . In the dim little room a urgent musky , animal-like odor soon began to manifest itself , rew sharper when Joe Beaver commenced to sweat . " You 're a day early , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Do n't know , " Andrew replied . " Why ? You are n't falling in love with some Maroon beauty ? " The Indian 's eyes batted once or twice and he licked clean his fingers before replying . " Maroon chief paint for war soon . " He wrinkled his nostrils with disdain . " Black warrior no can shoot bow  --  quiet , quiet . Chief Maroon promise Tomakwe two pearls , so  --  " The impassive bronze figure held up the tip of a little finger . Mr. Allerdice 's rheumy blue eyes became intent upon the savage now fondling the old dog 's head . " Losh , Andy . " He shook his untidy gray head . " ' T is as I fear . Yon new Colonel o ' the Maroons is plotting mischief . " " Why ? " Joe Beaver made a gesture to his mouth , all greasy from food . " Slave on plantings hungry  --  mad  --  no good work no eat . Many Engee soldiers gone there . " He indicated the north . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had spread far and wide over the island that a battalion of the 5oth Regiment of the Line  --  a considerable part of the regular establishment  --  had sailed for America it company with units from the St. Catherine and St. Andrew Regiments of militia . In the Crown &; Dove that very afternoon British officers had been heard roundly cursing Parliament 's shortsighted policy in leavingthe island so nearly denuded of dependable troops . For months now , Mr. Allerdice had heard various influential planters talk of raising and equipping their own trained bands , but somehow they had not got around to taking action . Mr. Allerdice shook his head . " I pray yer savage here is mistook , Andy . If he 's correct , God help the puir people i ' the up-country . Back in ' 65 I was wi ' the militia tae Johnny Carlton 's polink the day after a band o ' Maroons had sacked it wi ' the help o ' his ain slaves . Mon , mon ! ' T was a fearful sight , enough to sicken the stoma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose the local commandant has been warned ? " An . drew demanded . " I misdoot but he has now , " Allerdice replied , frowning at a pair of kittens battling ferociously between his feet . " Alas , Colonel John . P359son is too steept i ' his rum punches tae heed word from the Archangelhimsel ' . " The Indian looked so hopefully at the Scot 's other tobacco jar that Mr. Allerdice relented , passed it over . In silence the Penobscot selected a plug , drew his hunting knife , a murderous weapon with a heavy eight-inch blade , and commenced to shred the bright Virginiainto the bowl of a pipe he produced from the depths of his war bag . " I suppose , Joe , you 've been teaching your Maroon friends in the mountains how to scalp ? " For the first time , Joe Beaver 's teeth flashed in the briefest of grins . " No can , Cappen . Try , but no can . Wool too short . " That the quartermaster had indeed reverted to type , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he would have sat a month ago to squat on his heels , with broad brown toes spread out for balance . Also smoking , Andrew pushed fingers through the wild black tangle his hair had become , said thoughtfully , " Joe , the vessel I 've been waiting for made port today . " " Uh ? " " What with the garrison here reduced to a skeleton , with both duty frigates at sea next week  --  well , we 'll have the best chance to cut and run we 're ever likely to get . " Mr. Allerdice sighed . " I 'm of the opinion yer over-optimistic , lad . Ye ne'er can be sure what the Hanoverian 's minions will do . " Andrew tugged momentarily at his beard , thought , " Suppose these Maroons do attack ? The Commandant in this town of course will send every man he can spare up-country . " He slapped his thigh softly . " Yes , by God , an uprising will improve our chances . " The more he questioned Joe Beaver , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned , had been gathering quietly , and , for the past two days , the green-blue peaks above the coastal plain had c ( hoed to muffled drummings . By patient questioning he deduced that the Maroon chiefs had marked two particular estates for attack . Which ones they were , the bandy-legged , half-naked Penob- scot had not thought it important to learn . He was positive , however , the new Colonel meant to attack . In lazy , inverted ringlets , curls of smoke rose from the Penobscot 's pipe . He cocked a speculative , narrow black eye at Andrew . " Yes , Joe ? " " Capen , mebbe Tomakwe bring good news . " " Yes ? " " Remember squaw on brig ? " Andrew 's smile faded . Remember ? He was n't likely to forget Minga Allen , not in a month of Sundays ; the little slut had come within a particle of costing him his life . Damn her eyes , she need n't have yelled for the watch like that  --  no matter what her politics . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jerusha ! Just when he was getting Minga Allen removed to something like a comfortable spot in his memory  --  and now  --  " Tomakwe see  --  riding horse . " " Come , come , Joseph , " Mr. Allerdice broke in . " Whaur is she , mon ? She 's a friend o ' mine , too . " " Big ground , under high mountain , " the Indian explained pointingin a southeasterly direction . " Tomakwe no can say name , except Hall . ' " Mr. Allerdice swallowed a long draught of lime punch , thought hard . To the southeast were only two estates the names of which ended in the word " Hall . " No , there were three , if you counted Pondicherry Hall , but that was ' way down the coast . This left only Pembroke Hall and Hawthorn Hall , belonging to that extraordinarilycold and beautiful widow of Sir Thomas Moffat . " Do I understand it is one of these the Maroons intend to ravage ? " Joe Beaver 's naked shoulders rose and he looked infuriatingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Hall . " " Which one ? " Allerdice demanded . " Pembroke or Hawthorn ? " The bronze figure held up two fingers . " Mistress Allen must be at Hawthorn . " Andrew shook his head . The devil could take Minga Allen , for all he cared . He was n't interested .   " If it is Hawthorn Hall the Maroons mean to pillage , " Allerdice said , " ye 'd best send wur-r-rd . Ye canna leave her unwarned . Ye'dnot hesitate , Andy , had ye seen the bonny lass we found lyingnailed tae puir Johnny Carlton 's par-r-lor floor , blinded and split open from belly tae chin . "  |p362THERE  was a thunderstorm , characteristically Jamaican , rumbling further down the coast . In the late afternoon light the searing brillianceof lightning bolts were to be seen jabbing at the plain . Joe Beaver was confident , however , that it was not going to rain in the direction they were following . Indefinably , the countryside through which the half-breed had guided Andrew Warren was in an uneasy state . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon Europeans and some light mulattoes carrying muskets and looking pretty serious . The drummingkept recurring . Around five of the afternoon Andrew had reason to figure that , all things considered , they were n't making bad time . He found himselfwinded time and again , especially when this wild and luxuriantlyovergrown terrain sloped upward . The Penobscot , of course , made light going of it , stripped as he was . Besides , he 'd had ample opportunity to regain his shore legs . " Now why the devil am I doing this ? " Andrew asked himself as he flung himself , panting , to rest under a clump of logwoods . " Joe Beaver may be mistaken ; besides , what in tunket does Minga Allen mean to me ? " She was only a treacherous little baggage , a female Judas who 'd tried to condemn him to a gallows , which , if not sixty cubits high , would still certainly have served to choke the life out of him . I lc wet his lips with his tongue , then rubbed the aching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they encountered on the estates he and Joe Beaver traversed were acting sullen and uneasy . Squatting on their hams , they huddled together in patches of shade . Andrew recognized representatives of various tribes inhabiting the West Coast of Africa from Rio de Oro to the Bight of Benin . There were the fierce Dahomeyans and Coromantees , blue-black Senegalese with filed teeth and rows of cicatrices on cheeks and forehead , apatheticEboes , brisk Mandingoes . Most were branded in two places , some in only one . " How far now ? " he demanded , sponging his neck with an already sodden bandanna . Joe Beaver 's forefinger indicated the lowering sun . He bent first his second , then his third finger . " Two hours more , eh ? " Whew ! Sweat was prickling at the roots of Andrew 's short curly heard . Damn ! He 'd be rid of it the first moment he dared . The Penobscot nodded in high good humor . Ever since they had reached the wild foothills his flat , greasy features had become set in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had added a pair of flaming yellow ones . His copper bracelets shone and he had even run a dab of white lead along his cheek bones . There could be no doubt that Joe Beaver was very familiar with the lay of the land in this direction . Around midday the voyagers skirted an estate upon which some sort of a fete was in progress . There was the sound of drums and of muskets shooting . From a Negro hunter engaged in netting white wings , Andrew learned that this was the King 's birthday . He chuckled , wondered how George III might be feeling on this Fourth of June , 1778 ? Now that Spain and Holland were growing increasinglyhostile the King 's name day could not be overly cheery . Fervently , he hoped that His Britannic Majesty would celebrate his next in defeat . A plague on Minga Allen ! What a strange , complex creature . He 'd have to be mighty sharp in handling her . Well she 'd had her say that time . He could n't help admiring her for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he were to heap coals of fire on her head by appearing two jumps ahead of trouble . Joe Beaver tapped at his elbow , indicated what seemed a mere game trail . " Save walk , " he muttered , then , his sinewy loins working effortlessly , the Penobscot headed upwards along the course of a brook , away from the sun-baked , deeply rutted highway . They clambered up , up into a cool green woods in which wild pigs jerked their tails and clattered their yellow tusks before running away , followed by their striped and spotted shoats . Dozens of humming birds , gold , green , blue and ruby , darted about ; snakes slipped smoothly away under giant ferns . It felt mighty fine to be off the highroad , to be free of a sneaking suspicion that , at any moment , someone might come along who could , and would , denounce him . Never , until landing in Jamaica , had Andrew suspected what it meant to be hunted . He realized now the uncertainty about how much the pursuers knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fears had he not suffered in Mr. Allerdice 's warehouse ? Twice the Penobscot paused in a small hollow where , days ago , he had made his camp , though how he could have tolerated the swarming insects was a mystery . Just as twilight was falling the first drums commenced to throb . It came as a muted thump ! thump-thump , thump ! Tunk , tunk , a-tunk ! The instant he heard that cadence , Joe Beaver froze in his tracks listening intently . Immediately another drum answered ; blok ! blok-blok-blok ! , very quickly . The Penobscot looked increasingly puzzled when , on the mountain side off to their right , still another drum sounded a series of five rapid beats . His smile vanished ; Joe Beaver was listening intently . " What 's wrong ? " " Colonel Grandy this not tell Tomakwe . " Through painful use of French and English Andrew was madep365to understand the Penobscot 's surprise . Apparently , what had been contemplated was a darting raid , a sudden savage descent on the indicated sugar estates . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , probably at nightfall , kill all whites , then for several hours plunder furiously , and when the dawn came , only buzzards floating down from the sky would occupy the plunderedmansions . From what Andrew was able to gather , the date of the descent had been advanced . Joe Beaver was positive on that point , nodded his head until the feathers fairly squirmed . " Owoo-eu-ee . " Somewhere down on the great hazy blue-green plain stretching away below a conch-shell bugle sounded wailing noises , close to human . " Ou-ou ! " " Ouach-ie-e . " Faintly , other conches raised their voices , made an incredibly eerie sound . " Wagh ! " Joe Beaver sounded both angry and definitely disturbed . " Grandy big fool . " The Penobscot 's dully modelled flat face had thinned and his fingers on his war bag had begun to work like the paws of a nursing kitten . Through the leaves of a palmetto the white striping on his cheeks shone bright in the gathering gloom . Andrew asked , " Do they intend attacking tonight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He had gathered that a place called Lucinea , Hawthorn Hall and Pembroke Hall lay grouped in a loose triangle . Joe Beaver shrugged . His attention was not on what Andrew was asking but on a multitude of subtle sounds rising from the great green ocean of sugar cane below . Instinct told him that , beyond a doubt , the Maroons were at this very moment mounting an assault . Damnation ! Why was n't the half-breed more articulate ? Trying to get information out of Joe Beaver was like trying to drag a cat by its tail over a rug . " This trail leads to Hawthorn Hall ? " He felt anxious over the drumming . Minga  --  well , she deserved what she got , but an officer of the Continental Navy could n't stand by while a lady  --  even a damned King-loving Tory  --  stood in peril of a death ghastly beyond imagination . Joe Beaver nodded . When Andrew commenced to walk more quickly , he shook his plumed head . " No . Bad go fast . " Quite vanished was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They presently emerged in a small glade at one end of which the remnants of a campfire described a black circle on the earth , centeredwith a white powdering of ashes . The Penobscot tossed his war bag onto the ground and ran over to a towering cordium tree . Pushing aside a festoon of grenadilla vines he brought out a bow swathed in some oiled cloth , arrows , and a pair of African made spears . " Better this , " he held up a charred stick and pointed to Andrew 's face . Thoroughly , the quartermaster applied charcoal . Were the threatened estates taking precautions or just arguing as to whether this drumming really meant a raid ? The Maroons were far too clever not to drum talk just often enough to accustom people to the hearing of it . At length the New Englander was darkened satisfactorily . With gratitude he accepted the light spear Joe Beaver offered , added it to the pistol jammed into his belt . He felt better prepared , ready for what might chance . The lack of light seemed not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ridge that had seemed tall as a mountain . He travelled at a slow jog , his squat figure twisting and bending readily to avoid those lianas and creepers which dropped tentacle-like loops above the narrow , incredibly crooked path . Andrew , however , found the going increasingly difficult ; uneven stretches of the trail threw him off balance , roots snatched at his low shoes and twigs beat at his face and thorns lacerated his shins and ankles . He had n't much opportunity to dwell upon his difficulties ; more and more conches were moaning and variously pitched drums were banging more insistently . Joe Beaver halted so abruptly Andrew all but tripped over him . He was close behind when , like a serpent , the Penobscot slipped intop367the tangle of tall ferns , quickly strung his bow  --  a short but powerfulweapon made of mock orange . Andrew was glad to lie there beside the trail , sweat-drenched and trying to control his wild breathing . Like a cat gathering itself for a leap , the Penobscot waited , his blunt head outthrust . A faint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attracted the New Englander 's attention . The pattering sound grew louder ; then Andrewwatched nearly a dozen shadowy outlines speed past his hidingplace at a rapid surging run  --  from the same direction he had come . Though he could n't rightly see the runners , a rank smell of stale sweat remained in the humid atmosphere . When an owl in a nearby cottonwood raised its ghostly cry , another bird answered further up the ridge . Punished cruelly by midges and mosquitoes , Andrew started to arise but Joe Beaver 's hot hand closed over his elbow . " No  --  more coming . " Though the sea captain could hear nothing , another and a larger party of blacks  --  Maroons , of course  --  appeared on the path . These were n't running , just moving at a rapid walk . This time Andrew could glimpse the occasional sheen of a spear blade , the dim glint of a gun barrel . The Maroons vanished down the path , their big splay feet patterning the rich black earth of the trail . Suddenly it became appalling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if not hundreds , of Colonel Grandy 's fierce Maroonsbetween him and Hawthorn Hall . Their guttural talk was plainly audible . " Dat puntop swor ' . Whey you get ? " " Weston  --  las ' yeah . " " Man , you mus ' a mad , dat tree yeah go . You cuped Bard . " Another towering buck wearing a crown of ostrich feathers announced , " Ah goin ' kill de busha  --  he whip me . Den Ah tek de young buckra gal  --  " " Chaw ! Hit 's da house fo ' me . Hawtawn Hall bery rich . " Joe Beaver , however , refused to be hurried . Clearly , for the Penobscotthe situation held unexpected developments ; he was n't rushing headlong into a possible snare . Great bats kept swooping , screeching about the travellers ' heads when the trees began to thin and more stars to show overhead . The drumming had died away and only a few faraway conch shells sounded now and then . At the edge of the forest the Penobscot beckoned Andrew off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thicket . In the light of a faint quarter moon lay stretched out that estate Minga had mentioned aboard the lost Evergreen . Cane field on cane field , cattle fold on cattle fold , the expansive wealth of Moffat 's Penn lay sprawled over a wide , gently undulating terrain . Here and there whitish cart tracks shone , dividing and subdividing the plantation . Clusters of little white huts grouped themselves under a sheltering grove of trees . Peace immeasurable seemed to rule beneath myriad diamantine stars . The lowing of some thirsty cattle sounded loud out of all proportion . " Come , there 's precious little time , " Andrew urged , but the **32;7622;TOOLONG head shook violently . He planted his spear in the earth , then , hands braced on knees , peered cautiously downwards from the tall bluff on which they were standing , an eminence rising sheer from a great cane field below . The Penobscotlistened intently , his dew-sodden feathers drooping lank over his shoulder . All at once his breath came in with a hissing rush , and he sprang back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a quarter of a mile distant , a giant drum commenced to roar . The drummers must be pounding with all their strength until the taut bullock 's hide bellowed like a Titan in anguish . " Wagh ! See ! " Andrew could scarcely credit his vision . Pinpoints of fire appeared suddenly all over the plain  --  commenced to move and to converge on a white manor house , standing perhaps a mile and a half distant among its satellite buildings , like an island in the great sea of sugarcanefields . By fifties and hundreds , more torches sprang into being . Joe Beaverp369began trembling a little . Sudden gushes of flame shot up in various directions . " They 're firing the cane fields , " Andrew thought aloud . Every conch and drum in the vicinity was sounding . Great God ! The Allen girl and her Aunt were in the center of that irregular , brilliant circle of death . " Heil Heil " voices yelled from the foot of the bluff . " Kway ! Kway ! " answered Maroons plunging deeper in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hall . " House slaves . " Joe Beaver 's arm swung to the left . Apparently some of the outbuildings surrounding the manor had taken fire and quickly began erupting clouds of rose-tinted smoke , sending pinwheels of sparks spiraling dizzily upwards . Surprisingly late , a musket clanged , then followed a ragged volley . Far distant shouting increased . It was so windless that night that voices , even small voices , carried distinctly . Quite a large dwelling  --  the superintendent 's quarters , perhaps  --  next showed fire at its windows . The shooting died away , then recommencedas the defenders  --  evidently only a handful in number  --  succeeded in reloading . What to do ? Andrew racked his mind . The obvious course of fighting his way through to the women was hopeless . Now the facade of the manor house , which had appeared white by the starlight , began to reflect flames , and glowed a conch-shell pink . Andrew turned his smudged countenance to the Indian . " Are we just going to stand here ?  --  Come . " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was indubitably so , for from the plains rose a dreadful , earpiercingclamor . The firelit area about Hawthorn Hall squirmed with activity as the dull , crashing sound of some heavy object impactingagainst another suggested the use of a battering ram . A few straggling shots punctuated the uproar . Andrew could stand inactivity no longer . He could n't bear the idea of Minga waiting , waiting for that door to splinter and fall . When Joe Beaver shrugged , Andrew cursed him , then went plung- ing down the bluff into the canes below , regardless of thorny bushes . The glare of the fire increased until trees near the Manor House were cast into sharp silhouette . Burning brands were soaring so high it seemed as if , around Hawthorn Hall , a minor volcano was in eruption . A crashing behind him warned that the Penobscot had decided to follow . Reassured , Andrew ran faster and faster , the broad-bladed spear clutched in his left hand . He did n't properly know how to use such a weapon except that it was like a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now the fire was growing still greater . " Yoi ! yoi ! yoi ! " sharppitchedvoices yelled . A series of hideous screams penetrated the clamor . He became aware that other persons , too , were hurrying through the rows of cane . Without warning , a torch flared just ahead , revealeda cart track , and his heart stopped . Never had he seen such a vision as this  --  a line of revolted slaves ; their features were positivelydemonic . Fortunately , Joe Beaver stopped instantly , like himself , a few feet short of the track . The bookkeepers ' quarters must have been raided early in the attack , for a giant Negro appeared carrying an armful of bedclothes and a snuff-colored coat . Another was bent under a chest of drawers , and carrying in his free hand a chamberpot , of all things . " Heu-dah ! Heu-dah ! ! " A stark-naked buck came prancing along carrying a rum jug and flourishing a pallid head impaled upon the end of a pike . When Andrew realized that the severed head had long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his move and held him where he was . It was well he did so . A detachment of Maroons , arriving belatedly , appeared racing down from the bluff . Roughly , they pushed aside the booty-laden plunderers and raced on , swinging heavy cutlasses and howling hideous war cries . In the semi-darkness their sable faces seemed all white-ringed eyes and gleaming teeth . More half-naked field hands , blacks going berserk with rum lootedp371from the storehouse , went storming by ; some were brandishing cane knives , others adzes and hatchets ; but the most of them carried great clubs , wicked-looking affairs set with spikes . " No go nearer . " It was clear that Joe Beaver felt none too confident of his own safety . His hunting knife lay free in its sheath and his fingers worked nervously on the handle of his short broad-backed bow . An arrow lay ready , nocked on the rawhide string.  |p372BEFORE  Hawthorn Hall the uproar had become deafening . There was more shooting now . Despairing screams of male and female origin began rising . Andrew shook Beaver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rows of dewy cane stalks . Though sickened and outraged , he retained wit enough to stay off the cart track . Down it the revolted slaves and Maroons were runningand capering around . Not far ahead a horse began screeching in agony . When he reached a clearing , Andrew saw why . Field hands , long famished for meat , had captured a pair of riding horses . After hamstringing the mounts they never bothered to cut the throats of the wretched beasts but used their cane knives to hack gobbets of raw meat off the still living animals . Like wolves they ringed the wretched horses about , slashing and stabbing until at last they lay still . After veering aside and avoiding the clearing , Andrew emerged on a small garden and so got his first view of the doomed mansion , Up its double doorsteps was eddying a dark swarm of figures , while from its upper stories a continual stream of objects was being hurled to the ground , more often than not hurting those pillagers who were prancing idiotically about . By now the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down , but the conflagration revived , higher than ever , ' way above branches of the cottonwoods , when Hawthorn Hall 's cooking quarterstook . Smudged face or no , there was nothing to be gained by venturing out in the open . The whole clear space around the house was alivep373with flying sparks , squealing animals , and murderous , drunken blacks . " Damnation ! " Andrew growled . If only he had left Montego Bay just an hour earlier . Still , if any friendly black had chosen to tell Mrs. Moffat that that had been no ordinary drum talk , she and her niece might have escaped . Off to the eastward where the cane had been set afire , great , soaringsheets of fire , like billows from a flaming ocean , went rolling over the plain with the speed of race horses . Minga ! If only he had a suspicion of where she might be . A hundredvisions of her came to torment him . With that awful clear sense of shame which punishes an intelligent person who has played the fool , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hot dark , unconscious of myriad insects lancing at his skin with tiny barbs . " Do n't , in God 's name ! Do n't ! Help ! Help ! Oh-h  --  do n't ! " From a patch of cane to Andrew 's right the woman 's voice cried in an ascending scale ; sobbing , gorged with terror . He wheeled . Despite the gale of sound below the manor house , he sensed it must be Minga . Headlong he plunged back into the humid , sick-sweet-smelling cane . Guided by half-heard cries and pitifulentreaties , he travelled in furious leaps . Dew showered in his face , leaves lashed at his eyes . " Minga ! I 'm coming I 'm coming to  --  " He was too short of breath than more to choke out the words . He lost his hat , but held onto the spear and the pistol . Where Joe was he could n't tell . He burst into a little clearing before he knew it . It was n't very big , perhapsfifty feet across . There was another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came voices , grunts , squalling sounds , the smell of Africans mingled with the odor of rum . A squat figure overtook him . " Tomakwe shoot  --  " Faintly gilded by the flames rippling from the roof of the mansion , the Penobscot drew his short bow into a deep arc . When he loosed , one of the figuresforming part of that group busy in the big clearing uttered a rending screech , bounded into the air and fell , legs working spasmodically , arms futilely beating the air.  | Seldom had Andrew seen anything so quick , so perfectly articulatedas the halfbreed 's movements . In the space of twenty seconds the Penobscot had sped half that number of arrows . " Ki ! Who da ' ? " The house slaves , for such they must be by their sodden , ragged uniforms , peered about , bewildered by this silent lethal force . " Myall man he heah ! Oh ! Damballa ! " They scattered without knowing in which direction to avoid the death raining so silently out of the rustling sugar cane . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand and a pillowcase full of loot slung over his shoulder , came blundering right at Andrew . He never saw the New Englander , had time for only a frightened squeak before Andrew 's spear caught him full in the throat . The blade struck with such an impact that the haft snapped . Transfixed , the looter described a ludicrous backward half-arc before he fell futilelyto scrabble and twist and kick the earthen troughs between the rustling canes . Andrew was amazed to see the big clearing devoid of erect figures though several garish forms were rolling about , flopping on hands and knees , to collapse and tug at the arrow shafts protruding from their bodies . " Abtschiech  --  goch  --  gi  --  hillen ! " Eager as a terrier entering a box stall full of rats , the Penobscot rushed out . His short spear he planted in the nearest raider , then with a grunt of " Ke-hella ! " Joe Beaver slid out the long knife which normally rode above the crease between his buttocks . Those fallen figures who had groaned made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senseless murder Andrew , too , used his spear head . In his ears reverberated those pitiful cries . Only now he glimpsed what looked like a white puddle in the center of the trampled earth . It was a body lying half in , half out of a ragged mound of white cloth , a pattern of outstretched limbs clear against the black earth . Andrew plunged forward . Minga !  | " Take courage , " he panted . " Get you out . " Because a headless body can not speak , he received no answer . His teeth locked as the sea captain stood swaying , outraged , incredulous , above that dreadfully sprawled , pallid outline . The Penobscot was hopping about , grabbing at items of loot , stuffingthem into his war bag . The fire , soaring ever higher , kindled a deadly glow , drew dull flashes from the wet canes . Andrew stooped , caught up a limp and slippery arm , and peered intently . He did n't have to look twice to recognize the twined dolphins on that luck bracelet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! This is n't  --  No sense . You 're not  --  Jamaica ! " Joe Beaver , in jumping over a body , missed his footing , stepped on an arrow projecting from the back of a great fat house-slave . The shaft gave , snapped with a little crack ! " Come . " The Penobscot , carrying a shirt full of plunder , tugged at his elbow . " Cappen , mus ' go quick ! " Go ? How could a man go , leave so dear a chalice lying shattered ? Never before had he realized Minga 's fingers were so slim . Take the bracelet ? No . It was a part of her legend . He remembered first seeingit in the Port Commandant 's office  --  that damned Colonel Saunderslooking down his long red nose . " Cappen ! Cappen ! " There was no doubt that go they must . Yelping like a pack of beagles in full cry , another party of slaves was rioting down the cart track away from the plundered mansion . Andrew turned away  --  yearned to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That this should happen ! His mind rushed back  --  saw Minga again on the Evergreen 's quarterdeck , serene , supple , and calm . And now . Now ! No sense in staying . The Trumbull would be launched some day soon . When Joe Beaver caught up the dead looter 's pillowcase , gave it to him , he grabbed it mechanically . Together they shouldered back into the friendly , sheltering sugarcane.  | No longer a ruddy glare beat through the tree tops . The animal noises of slaves drunk on the rum their sweat had made possible , lingered as a confused murmur in the distance . But triumphant , illtimeddrums were still muttering . When they came to a stream , Andrew flung himself flat , dram ; two or three big gulps , plunged his head under the water until he was all but strangled , then rolled over and lay quite still in the ferns . Minga . Minga . Why had the counters of life fallen in this order ? He felt somewhat as he had when one of H.M.S. Racehorse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That had been the end of Hemingway but he could n't admit to himself that Will , his sober , cheery companion in many an hour of fight and frolic , would n't be on deck tomorrow . Somehow , he could n't convince himself either , that Minga Allen no longer lived . Yet she was lying back there , defiled , mutilated , trampled into the black muck of a rural cart track . Vaguely , Andrew was aware of an increasing tension on his skin . Without looking , he knew the stickiness was caused by the drying of blood which had spurted from the fleeing house-slave he had speared . God above ! Why , he still was carrying the fellow 's booty . A fine officer to get into a spin like this ! Why , aboard ship , in even a brisk engagement , he had known just what to do , no matter how the battle went . He yearned to go back and kill more of those black hellions who had destroyed so lovely , so irreplaceable a creature as Minga Allen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drain slowly from his beard and was aware of the taste of charcoal strong in his mouth . Joe Beaver was fishing from his bulging shirt a weird collection of objects  --  asilver ladle , an amber necklace . Despite himself , Andrew 's curiosity was piqued . What next would the Penobscot produce ? A silver snuffer , a fan with an ivory handle , a silver tea box set with jade . The Penobscot kept grunting happily to himself . The white lead on his face had been replaced with a more intricate design . When he had done it , Andrew could not have told , had his life depended upon it.  |p377He  simply could n't reflect on how much he had lost . During the action with the picaroons , in the gig , and penniless ashore . Minga Allen had shone as a fine , rarely courageous woman . What an utter idiot he had been . Now it was too late . His feeling of impotence was infuriating . A man should be able to do something about such outrages. - " I 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Suppose she had been that damned Colonel 's leman ? He had learned , in the last year , that that which seemed utterly immoral in one person , might be explicable , even admirable , in another . A mosquito jabbed at his cheekbone . He sat up , studied Joe Beaver across the starlit clearing . Methodically , the Penobscot was packing his loot into a square of cloth , cleverly cramming the ladle into a silver coffeepot , the necklace into a teak and mother-of-pearl tea caddy . What about his own loot ? For the first time he realized that this pillowcase was heavier than lead . Because it was necessary to think about something besides that dreadfully crushed figure down on the plain , he reached into the bag and fumbled about until a case bumped against his fingers . He drew it out but , before opening it , cast a quick look at Joe Beaver . His ex-quartermaster was fully occupied in packing . Andrew pressed a small steel plunger , was startled that the lid sprang back so readily . Jerusha ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this light . Bright stones ! The realization sent a hot , jolting current flowing through his weary frame . Diamonds . Jerusha ! And again , Jerusha ! Groping deeper into the bag , he encountered a small leather bag . From its shape he guessed it contained coins ; from its weight he deduced that the coins were of gold . Inside were lengths of silk and more square boxes . It would appear that the house-slave had known all too well just where Mrs. Moffat had kept her valuables . Abruptly , the realization came home that the Evergreen had been lost , but not in vain . Here , here in this dirty , dew-sodden pillowcase lay power , unexpected , undreamed-of power ; gold , a pretty good store of it ; diamonds ; and those other cases must hold other gems . But Minga now could not benefit  --  all along he had wanted to replaceher losses , though God knew there was no obligation . Every time you went aboard ship , you knew you were exposing yourself to certain risks . His mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of numbed precision . It would n't do , perhaps , to let Joe Beaver suspect , so he slipped the diamond necklace , case and all , into his shirt . " I can get away now . Why , I can buy a ship if I need to ! " He commenced to tug excitedly at his little beard . " And sail it back to Boston , come Lobster backs , hell , or a hurricane ! " In the firefly-lit gloom he smiled in anticipation of his meeting with the drug dealer . Let Senhor Carlos Cardozo ask what he would ; what he 'd get would be another matter . The whole length of the American Coast the Warrens had a reputation as shrewd bargainers  --  shrewdbut honest . His imagination took hold , commenced to spread like a grass fire . " Why not be clever , lad ? Get yourself over to Saint Domingue where the French are . At Cap Francois or Port au Prince you can fit yourself out for a privateer . With a regular Naval officer 's skill at navigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But no , that was n't what was wanted back in Boston . His orders read to return with the medicines as swiftly as might be possible . Orders were given to be obeyed . The decision to let privateering go came easier when he remembered Dr. Blanchard 's dark tragic eyes and recollected what that hell-hole of mercy called the Drydock had been like . He got to his feet . " We had better get out of here , Joe . " The woods were swarming with retreating Maroons , some of themstill hungry for plunder . It would n't do to lose this new lease on hope . Nor would it do to dwell on Minga Allen 's ghastly end.  |p379THE  shipper 's agent puffed out round little cheeks , folded the invoice , and arose . " Everything , sir , is now in order . Your chests , boxes and trunks are cleared for Philadelphia . " He smiled politely . " Your trunks shall go aboard the Swan this very evening , Dr. Pawling . Captain Taplow has declared his intention of setting sail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir . " Dr. Charles Pawling reset his elegant , Prussian-blue grosgrain waistcoat with a careless tug . " Very well , my man ; make sure not a single item is mislaid . I hold you responsible . " " I am conscious of the honor , sir . " " You will see that my retainers get aboard tonight ? The Indian , Atherton and Mr. Bird ? " The shipping agent folded plump hands before him , bowed a little . " Drunk or sober , sir , they 'll be put aboard . " He had a proper respect , had Henry Dawkins , for one of the gentry and if ever he had seen a real nob , it was this elegant physician from Savannah-laMar . He made a brave figure did young Dr. Pawling in his skyblueskirted coat , buff nankeen breeches , and smart , Irish lace jabot . God 's truth , for all his unfashionable black beard , he was a gentleman , all right , from the top of his blue-black hair to the soles of his feet . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a physicker . Dr. Pawling 's sharp black eyes seemed to see straight into a body ; those high cheekbones of his made him look lean and hungry ;  |p380but  of course he could n't be hungry  --  not anybody as had so many heavy gold seals a-dangle from his watch fob . " I claim it 's a plagued nuisance to travel like this , " drawled Charles Pawling , M.D. " I had been entirely confident of chartering a vessel . " His gaze wandered down the little port 's dilapidated but busy waterfront . Several ships , waiting to rendezvous with a convoy for England , rode at anchor in the incredibly clear blue water . " Why I was informed that so wretched a port as Falmouth would be a likely place to find me a vessel , I will never fathom . Should have made for Montego Bay , I fancy . " The shipper 's agent clucked commiseration . " A pity , sir , a great pity you found disappointment here . Nonetheless , I venture you will find the Swan a comfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guns , new and Bristol-built , I might add . " Dr. Charles Pawling tossed a half crown onto the agent 's paperswampeddeck . " My friend , you have been helpful . Pray pledge me to a swift and pleasant journey to Philadelphia . " Mr. Dawkins beamed , rubbed his hands , bowed several times . " That I will , sir , and I 'll pledge a French cruiser do n't come up with you . " He looked suddenly downcast . " The Johnny Crapauds have grown so monstrous bold , sir , insurance rates mount daily  --  and already the rates run higher than a cat 's back . Still , I warrant we 'll beat them Froggies again as handily as we did back in ' 13 and ' 63 . " " I should rather fancy meeting up with a Frenchman of equal metal , " the elegant figure remarked and , swinging a gold-headed walking stick , he strolled out into the late afternoon glow . No , Falmouth certainly was n't much of a town ; just two and a half streets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Still , it had seemed small enough to be safe , a good place to sail from , Charles Pawling mused , stroking his brief black beard . Jerusha ! He would be almighty glad to shave the thing off  --  but not for a while yet . No wind tonight . The Swan lay faithfully mirrored beside her dock . The other ships , further out , rode motionless . Andrew Warrenp381felt a vast impatience to be off . Thee task of playing the part of Dr. Charles Pawling from Savannah-la-Mar was becoming tedious , though he had a real facility at mimicking various accents , especially English intonations . As he strolled along with a pair of gaunt curs sniffing at his heels , he wondered why it was that most people who were clumsy at mathematics , were able at languages , and the other way around . Yes , it was a nuisance to remember the well-born Britisher 's affected drawl , to cultivate a convincingly patronizing and sometimes insultingmanner towards underlings . Two of the ships nearest shore also had been making ready for sea , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vessel , the full-rigged ship Serpentine . All day gangs of sweating blacks had rowed heavily loaded barges , scows and wherries out to these tall merchantmen . Blocks and tackles had whined protest at the heavy loads of rum , pimento , sugar , and logwood that went swinging up on their decks . Nor was he the only stranger in town . Far from it . During the past forty-eight hours merchants , insurance brokers , prospective passengers , whores , cut-purses , and estate agents had appeared . Some came sailing along the coast in pinks , cutters and tiny sloops ; others rode in on oxcarts , kittareens , or a-horseback . Falmouth teemed with such excitement as would not again prevail for weeks and months . For all his beard and fine clothes , Andrew grew uneasy at this influx . His inn , the Trident Tavern , had been all but taken over by British and Colonial Army officers ordered to duty in America ; army contractors and a scattering of merchants completed the Swan 's passengerlist . The convoy vessels , bound for ports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passenger  --  invalid soldiers , gouty sugar planters , wealthy island aristocrats with wives and daughters , gay at the prospect of making a great showing at home . He encountered Atherton and Joe Beaver  --  alias John Castor  --  the latter clad in seamen 's clothes again , but , as pre-arranged , gave only the merest nod of recognition . The halfbreed seemed delighted to be returning to America . Nov that he was wealthy , according to his standards , the Penobscot 's chief ambition was once more to see a buck deer go slipping quietly through a clump of white birches . Mr. Isaac Bird -- otherwise Jared Beetle  --  also had undergone sharp changes . On his release from jail two weeks back , the big mate had presented a sorry sight ; filthy , bearded , and with fetter sores festering on his ankles and wrists . His whole body was lumpy with infected insect bites . Certainly , his never very positive love for the Crown and its minionshad vanished as frost from a sunny windowpane . Andrew figuredthe mate must be still a-bed after his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half of Falmouth awake until near midnight . Naturally , he had n't been able to deny poor Beetle a few pounds with which to celebrate his enlargement , though God knew what he could find attractive in the tawdry wenches who in the early evening rolled their hips about Charlotte Square . The Trident 's taproom was fairly overflowing with red-and-blue uniformed officers toasting their luck at leaving such a triple-cursed , dull , sweltering plague-spot as His Majesty 's Colony of Jamaica . A yellow-faced captain with brilliant green revers to his tunic was announcing with bibulous gravity , " Aye , you look on a fortunate fellow . I 'm the last of ten line officers in my battalion . We all came out in ' 73 . " He raised his cup . " Well , here 's to ' em  --  Smollett , Thompson , Bridges , and all the rest . " A very thin major of artillery nodded . " Ca n't believe I 'm pulling out on me own feet and not pickled in a cask of rum . " " The devil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indies for that matter ! Why , in God 's name , do we send our best blood out here to rot and die ? " The speaker was a mottle-faced , middle-aged naval officer with a loose mouth and hair gone gray years before its time . " Wish we were going home  --  " " America ai n't so bad , they say  --  stab me if it is , " the artilleryman said . " Collins vows the ladies of Philadelphia are positively prodigal of their affections . " On the tavern 's upper floor contractors and officers were cursingp383their servants , urging them strap up and get the dunnage down tothe Swan . " Where are you bound ? " the engineer queried of the purple-faced naval officer . " Lord knows . My orders read for Halifax . " Gloomily the officer in blue stared into the bottom of his leathern jack of porter . " I 'll damned well freeze to death in those latitudes after my blood 's been so thinned out down here . " " Who 's for Savannah ? You , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Aye , as a replacement for the 60th  --  they 've had the summer fever bad in Savannah . Well , it 's a cheering thought that nothing can be worse than Jamaica . " The captain banged his pewter mug on the table . " Host ! Host ! Fetch us a toddy . I insist , gentlemen . " He turned ravaged , jaundiced features , noticed the big doctor from Savannahla-Marmoodily sipping a glass of Malaga . " I say , Doctor , you must join us , " Captain Mordaunt invited . " A thousand thanks , sir , but I 'm on the point of leaving to keep an appointment at the Ram 's Head Ordinary . " He bowed to the brilliant , heavily perspiring group . " However , I shall hope to join you anon . Perhaps then you will join me in toasting a swift voyage to America ? " Andrew had no appointment , but felt it advisable to remain as aloof as possible . Would n't do to have someone question his tale about hailing from Savannah-la-Mar , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So far , he had successfully represented himself as intent now on winning a commission in the Royal Americans , the British Legion , or some other such Loyalist regiment . He felt disinclined for roistering , at least not until those chests of calomel , ipecac , camphor , spirits , cordials , those boxes of alcohol , benzoin , the chests of surgeon 's tools were safely landed in Philadelphia . About getting them through the British lines there , he was n't particularly concerned  --  people came and went pretty much as they pleased through Lord Howe 's lines.  | He chuckled as he sauntered along the waterfront . To think that all those drugs had been bought for only two of the six large diamondsin that breathtaking necklace . Should he have turned the stones in ? Possibly . But was this not enemy country ? Did not the needs of American sailors take precedence over a parcel of British heirs who probably already had all they needed ? How odd to think that all those friendly chaps at the Trident were , in truth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things : You came to understand their way of thinking , and then refused to be patronized . Perhaps the Ram 's Head might be a quieter place to take supper ; his last meal in Jamaica . Jerusha ! The three months here had whirled by like a mad rush of leaves on the forest floor under the blast of an autumn gale.  |p385THE  Ram 's Head Ordinary was a more prepossessing establishment than the Trident , Andrew perceived ; less noisy , less busy . A pretty building set right at the harbor 's edge , it boasted a wide verandah draped with a flaming vine of some sort . He would relish a final meal of turtle steak and okra , topped off with custard apples and some of that deliciously aromatic coffee such as could only be brewed from beans grown among the Blue Mountains back of Kingston . Very elegant in his blue coat and waistcoat , the New Englander wandered indoors , nodded to three or four planters in soiled white ducks and a pair of burly young subalterns sitting together in the taproom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordered another Malaga and seated himself on a small terrace shelteredby a canopy of palm leaf thatch . On the way he paused before a mirror to reset his jabot , to make sure that his curly little beard was in order . His beard , of course , had caused a certain amount of speculation in Falmouth . Almost everyonethere had raced to the conclusion that he must be French or Spanish . Whoever had heard of a bearded Englishman in the tropics ? Had England not been at war with France , Andrew readily would have given himself out as French . Now the whole port was smoking mad over an unexpected French descent upon a convoy off St. Kitts . The disaster was even now being discussed in the taproom . " They 'll pay for it , and dearly ! " a choleric sea captain was prophesying . So the French were ambushing British convoys ! Andrew 's step
