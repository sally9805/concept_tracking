Before the war , the rose-red , strutting flamingos in the San Antonio zoo lived high : their special diet contained fresh shrimps and dried flies imported from Mexico . Then the zoo got economical . The flamingos were fed a wartime porridge of dog meal and vegetables . Their color slowly faded from red to dirty white . <P> Last week the flamingos were getting their shrimps and dried Mexican flies again , and their feathers were already turning pink-demonstrating , said Zoo Director Fred Stark , how they owe their complexions to their diet . Within six months he expects the flamingos to be as red as they ever were .
