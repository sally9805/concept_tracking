txt The chairman of the War Manpower Commission , Mr. , announces that within two weeks he will send a detailed legislative program to the President to provide for compulsory labor service in wartime . He will ask for power to require a man to remain on a job or to transfer to another one . He will insist on a corresponding obligation on the part of employers to retain workers who are assigned to them . The demands of total war are so remorseless that we can not afford to reject any such proposals in advance . But we should be candid enough to recognize that they will raise great problems . On one point , certainly , there should be no room for dispute . Before we attempt to impose compulsory labor we must get rid of the whole network of artificial restrictions that we have built up against voluntary labor . We must rid ourselves , in other words , of the innumerable devices for creating unnecessary jobs . We must end every useless political job in the Federal , State or city bureaucracies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relief for the period of the war . Relief should be given only to unemployables . Employables must either be trained for war work or used to take the necessary civilian jobs of others transferred to war work . We must reduce Federal works to an absolute minimum . Donald M. Nelson has just pointed to the action that must be taken in his letter to eight government agencies , telling them to stop all nonmilitary construction for the Federal Government which is not essential to the war , and asking that a review be made even of military projects as well . We must suspend the basic fortyhour week for the period of the war and substitute a basic forty-eight-hour week . The average work-week in Great Britain is fifty-six hours . Our own average work-week in industrial establishments is still less than fortythree hours . It is absurd to talk of compulsory labor while this situation is retained . Not least of all , labor unions must be asked to give up the rules and practices they have built up over years to compel the creation of additional jobs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in so far as they are not needed for safety but merely for creating jobs . Thurman Arnold has performed a public service by citing endless " feather-bed " practices of this sort . He has told of union barriers against the use of spray guns for painting ; of union efforts to prevent the use of prefabricated materials in building ; of unions that require employers to hire a man who has nothing to do but turn on a switch . We can not afford these luxuries and follies in wartime . We can not allow unions to force business men to employ useless labor . We can not allow them to restrict the efficient use of men and machines . We can no longer tolerate unions insisting , as in Chicago , that employers can not bring in truck cement mixers unless they hire extra men to stand around and watch . We can no longer tolerate unions forcing employers to " employ " a new truck driver , whether he works or not , when a truck has crossed a State line . We can no longer allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delivery . We can no longer permit union plumbers to insist on cutting off the threaded ends of delivered pipes , so that they may do the job over . We can no longer allow union electricians to tear electrical wiring out of prefabricated houses so that they may reinstall wiring . We can no longer allow theatrical scene shifters to insist that a " full crew " of scene shifters be employed even in plays where there is no scenery . We can no longer tolerate the " stand-in " orchestra , or , in fact , the whole fantastic system of made work that Mr. Petrillo insists on imposing . It would be pleasant to think that we could get union leaders to change their rules in this respect by voluntary agreement . Experience shows , however , that this is not possible . One has merely to think of Mr. Petrillo . As Mr. remarks , in defense of his own proposed bill : " The power of compulsion is in essence a protection to the great majority who act voluntarily . They must be made to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action , and is prepared to require compliance by the few who refuse to cooperate . " Whether or not this can be applied to his own proposals , it certainly applies to ending the artificial restrictions on efficiency and economy of manpower .
