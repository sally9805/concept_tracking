Benign , witty Sir William Henry Beveridge by last week was second only to Winston Churchill as Britain 's most popular man . Britons had bought more than 200,000 full texts of his plan for post-war social security . The Ministry of Information was bringing out a threepenny Beveridge Report in Brief and every Army officer was to be supplied with this brief for the instruction of rankers . Sir William 's Plan had become so popular with the people that the political parties were falling over each other proclaiming its principles their own : <P> &gt; Chairman of the Conservative Party Major Thomas Lionel Dugdale : " A bold and imaginative conception . . . . We are only too ready to extend a welcome to the principle . " <P> &gt; Chairman of the Liberal Party Council H. Seebohm Rowntree : " The Liberal Party gives unqualified approval to the objectives and the three guiding principles . . . . In full accord with the Liberal tradition . . . . A brilliant piece of constructive work . " <P> &gt; The National Council of Labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reconstruction of the new Britain must be the adoption of a charter of security . . . therefore calls upon the Government to introduce the necessary legislation at an early date . " <P> &gt; Communist Party : " It corresponds to the deep desires of the soldiers , the workers in industry , the housewives , of all who fear want and insecurity after the war . . . . The broad principles will be universally welcomed by all progressive opinion . " <P> Though public acclaim made it expedient for the parties thus to go on record , it was by no means certain that the sweeping proposals of the plan would become law . Britain was still leftish-talking , solid-acting Britain . Parliament was still committee-loving , compromise-loving Parliament . Conservatives and the business community still wanted to know where the money was coming from . Labor officials thought " the detailed proposals must necessarily be subject to further scrutiny . " And the powerful National Association of Insurance Committees dug in and said that the general situation regarding Beveridge " will be vigilantly watched . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things were going , broke off his lectures explaining the plan long enough to marry his former secretary , Mrs. Jessy ( " Janet " ) Philip Mair , grandmother and economist in her own right . The marriage , performed by the Archbishop of Canterbury at Caxton Hall , was Sir William 's first . Chirped he : " Though I have known the lady . . . for many years , yet marriage must always be an adventure . Yet my critics say that social security kills that spirit . "
