Next to steam ( which old wind jamming navy men welcomed like a mouse in the morning oatmeal ) the biggest thing that has happened to fighting-ship design is the airplane . Before the epochal crippling of the Bismarck by aerial torpedo , and the crashing success of unsupported aircraft in sinking the Prince of Wales and Repulse , designers of battlewagons and smaller craft had given only half an eye to defense against the new weapon on the seas . Those demonstrations ended all arguments , basically altered ship design . <P> Today the U.S. Navy , busy on the biggest shipbuilding program in the world 's history is at work on ships-battleships , cruisers and carriers-whose design has been radically changed since the keels were laid . How they have been changed is a military secret , for the Jap and the German to learn at their own expense . <P> But the changes forced by the airplanes on all the basic attributes of fighting ships-firepower , mobility and protection-have been so marked that some of them will be apparent even to landlubbers . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be dismissed without sober consideration . <P> For such dreams there is a wealth of background material . When naval strength was computed in terms of wooden ships and iron men , an unidentified artist in the Mexican war of 1846-47 pictured the battleship of 1952 . It was a cathedral-like fortress armed and armored to the crow 's nest . His pagodaed vision had a strange prescience in its slanting surfaces , its radical protection for the crew . <P> On the practical side , a famed forerunner of modern design was the ironclad Maine ( 6,682 tons ) , ugly and awkward but formidably armed for her day ( four 10-and six 6-inchers ) , but no match for the mine that took her in Havana harbor . U.S.S. North Dakota was another step to today , with 20,000-ton displacement , ten 12-inchers , fourteen 5-inchers . <P> But the North Dakota , scrapped before the march of naval progress , was a Mississippi scow compared with the U.S.S. Washington , one of the newest battlewagons , with her heavy armor protection for crews above decks ( against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ topped by nine 16-inchers ) , her imposing hull and turret armor , her sleek , low-lying speed lines . <P> The Washington , with anti-aircraft guns less defiladed by stacks and superstructure than any of her forebears , has a mighty slug in her guns , plenty of speed to dodge while the battle is on . Her successors will go farther still . But none will go so far as the dreamboat design put out by Industrial Stylist George W. Walker of Detroit . He went all the way , streamlined his ship like an airplane , put his main battery in mushroom turrets , massed bridge and stack into a bulletlike island alongside a launching deck for aircraft . It was another vision . But no man could reasonably say that the battleship of 1955 might not have more than a passing resemblance to the dreamboat Walker .
