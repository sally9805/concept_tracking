Every nation in wartime derives inspiration from its own peculiar tales of heroism . Some are legend , some are fact . Legend or fact , a tale was told by the Chinese last week of Chen Chung-chu , a guerrilla leader in the never-never land of North China behind the Japanese lines . <P> As an ace officer of General Li Tsung-jen , Chen needled the Japanese so spectacularly that they made a special expedition to mop up him and his men . <P> The Japanese beheaded Chen Chung-chu . They left the body for the villagers , took the head away . <P> Chen 's wife next day went to see her husband . She knew that he could not rest quietly in the good earth without his head . Tucking a wash basin and a bottle of alcohol under her arm , she trudged off to Japanese headquarters at Taichow . From a Japanese officer she demanded the head of her husband . The officer refused . <P> Then Chen 's wife put down the wash basin . She pulled a dagger from the sleeve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if she were not given her husband 's head she would add to his corpse two dead bodies , hers and the officer 's . The Japanese officer took the head from a basket and gave it to her . <P> Carefully placing the head in the wash basin , Chen 's wife soaked it in alcohol and took it back to her village . There she sewed it to the neck and buried body and head . Now Chen and his head rest in a grave no different from thousands of others that dot the green hills of China .
