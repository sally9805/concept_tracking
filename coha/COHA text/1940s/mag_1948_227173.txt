For red-hot enthusiasm , Argentine football ( i.e. , soccer ) fans rate with any sport fanatics in the world . Buenos Aires alone supports 16 big-league clubs and 24 second-class teams , each with its own stadium or field . The season runs for 30 weeks : on Saturday and Sunday afternoons , crowds totaling more than 300,000 turn out in the capital . <P> When a porteo goes to the stadium he wears his oldest clothes , yells himself hoarse , insults opposition rooters , throws oranges , occasionally sets fire to the stands if things go too badly . Few women ( and fewer ladies ) go to the games . <P> Futbol and politics are so tangled that sometimes it is hard to tell exactly where the kicking ends and the politicking begins . Each of the big sporting clubs that sponsor first-class teams has at least one prominent patron-politico to wangle favors , subsidies and stadiums from the government . So last week , when all football schedules were abruptly canceled , it was both a political and a sport scandal . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brooding over past grievances , organized a union ; some felt underpaid , all were exasperated by the rules which allow clubs to sell or trade players at will . Wealthy clubs had taken to buying up promising hooters , not to play but to sit idle on the bench . A fortnight ago , the players put on a token strike . At exactly 3:45 p.m. , in every stadium in Argentina , all players abruptly stood stock-still for one minute , then went on with the game . <P> Football Czar Oscar Nicolini ( who is also Argentina 's director of Post &; Telegraphs ) was no man to suffer such a rebuke in silence . Promptly he called a meeting of the powerful governing body , AFA ( Asociacin de Futbol Argentina ' ) . To teach the players a stern lesson , AFA voted to wash out the rest of the season . <P> Blunder . The minute the decision was announced , the government , watching carefully , sensed a major political blunder . The season had only five weeks to go , and the 50,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So were backers of the second-place " River Plate " club ( nicknamed Los Millonarios because of the club 's free-handed spending for players ) . So were the " Boca Juniors " ( No. 1 fan : President Juan Pern ) . So was nearly everybody else . <P> No one could prove that word came down from on high . Nevertheless , in midweek , AFA unexpectedly called off the suspension , offered to arbitrate the dispute . Negotiations dragged , and the clubs got set for Sunday games with non-union oldsters and youngsters . Smart porteo money was on a settlement that would shortly have the stars back on the field , kicking and happy .
