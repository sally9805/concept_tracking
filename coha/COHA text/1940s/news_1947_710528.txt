txt More Patrolmen on the Streets MARY VAUGHN MARVIN . Letters to The Times More Patrolmen on the Streets To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORE TIMES : Last April Police Commissioner Wallander was quoted in the papers as saying that " Parents ignore their responsibility to supervise their children . " It is true that some parents ignore their responsibilities , but certain services of the city could be a great help to all parents . We must remember that youth is more influenced by what it sees than by what it hears . For many years I have wished that the youth of this country in our large cities could have had the support during their uncertain adolescent years of more often " seeing the Law , " in the person of the patrolman on duty in the streets . The sight of that patrolman constantly and at irregular times , walking the block , catching first offenders , giving wise advice , and making a good early demonstration that " crime does n't pay " would be a very steadying force to our boys and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set out on a campaign to show the need for more patrolmen , industry , insurance and - the private citizen would say it was cheap at the price .
