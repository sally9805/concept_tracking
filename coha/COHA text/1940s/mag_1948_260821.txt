Last week 's U.N . story starts , properly , with a bearded , 16th Century Frenchman called Jean Bodin , who believed in witchcraft , numerology , astronomy a " nd national sovereignty . <P> He began a career as a political pundit when a Master of the Mint declared that prices had not risen in France in three centuries . Bodin answered in a sizzling pamphlet showing that in fact prices were going up &; up , and God only knew where they would end . After that , he digressed from economics ( publishing a treatise on witchcraft called the Demonomania of Sorcerers ) , and went on to six volumes of political theory , his major work , in which he set down the notion that the state is supreme and inviolable as a matter of natural right . That right , he said , springs from the people 's need for a strong protecting hand in troubled times. * <P> More . &; more people agreed with Bodin until states became so strong that citizens began to limit state powers by bills of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sovereignty by international organization . <P> The Russian position in Paris last week , on which the issue of war or peace heavily depended , had less to do with Marx and Lenin than with Jean Bodin . It was in large measure a pigheaded defense of natsionalny suverenitet unlimited . <P> The Strong Chest . Up for discussion in the U.N . ' s Political Committee was the two-year-old U.S. proposal for international control and inspection of atomic energy . That was , in effect , a limitation of national sovereignty , for it provided that a worldwide agency would have the right to cross any country 's frontiers and look into any country 's factories . Cried Russia 's Andrei Vishinsky : " Nobody will blind us and confuse us with beautiful words about the necessity of waiving part of our national sovereignty . . . The control agency would be an American agency ... an international monopolistic super-trust . The overeager Russian-English interpreter rendered this as " superduper crook . " Our chest is strong ; you can not push us down . Our neck is not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Hector McNeil bitingly bore down on Vishinsky 's reactionary nationalism . a " As a junior Socialist , " he said , " I find it a little unusual to find my revoludenary friend objecting to such a concept as international ownership . . . " <P> Next day Vishinsky declared that Russia would agree to international control-if the control agency were subject to a Russian veto ; that would mean no international inspection except as Russia specifically granted permission . <P> The Obsolete Doctrine . Russia 's frantic insistence on national sovereignty was also demonstrated in the Commission on Human Rights , which was considering a worldwide Bill of Rights . Russia 's Alexei Pavlov promptly cried that it represented interference with Russian sovereignty . Belgium 's Paul-Henri Spaak summed up the West 's position when he cried : " We fear you when you preach this antiquated , obsolete doctrine of national sovereignty .. . "
