Malaria , which killed Alexander the Great in his prime and often saved Rome by cutting down besieging armies , is still the greatest enemy of man 's health and welfare . The U.S. is one of the few areas of the world that has reduced malaria 's ravages to manageable size . Elsewhere , it claims 300 million victims , 3,000,000 of whom die each year . By sapping the vitality of its victims , malaria breeds poverty . It bars economic progress in so many parts of the world that it has been called a " gigantic ally of barbarism . " <P> The Sleeper . Most Americans think of malaria as a tropical disease , says Leon J. Warshaw in Malaria : the Biography of a Killer , published this week ( Rinehart ; $3.75 ) . Actually , says Dr. Warshaw , the disease has struck from the Arctic to Patagonia . Once known as " the shakes , " it was rife a century ago throughout most of the U.S. Dr. Warshaw , a New York diagnostician , estimates the number of U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows just how many there are , because malaria is a skilled mimic , imitating the symptoms of other diseases . <P> Granting that malaria is no longer a serious problem in most of the U.S. , Dr. Warshaw warns : " It is impossible to predict when a change in climatic conditions , even though temporary , may cause an explosive outbreak . " However , the widespread epidemics expected after U.S. servicemen returned from malarial outposts in Africa and Asia have not developed . <P> Guardedly optimistic , the U.S. Public Health Service considers malaria licked as a public health menace , but it is still " a sleeping giant . " Says PHS 's Dr. Robert M. Coatney : " We should n't do away with our police force . As soon as we relax , it will come back . " <P> The Police . For 250 years quinine was the only police agent used to control malaria . Swamp drainage and screening of buildings have been added to the force since 1898 , when it was shown that malaria parasites ( tiny protozoa of the genus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anopheles mosquitoes . The mosquito picks up the parasites from infected humans , nurtures them and injects them into fresh victims . The parasites run through the bloodstream of their victim , causing periodic fevers at the peak of their reproductive cycle ; many lodge in the spleen , causing local pain . <P> DDT has now become the most powerful of the antimalarial police . New drugs are being perfected to replace quinine and wartime atabrine . The ideal drug , says Dr. Warshaw , must cure ( not merely suppress ) all forms of malaria . It must be easy to make and take , and so cheap that hundreds of millions of men , women &; children all over the world can get it .
