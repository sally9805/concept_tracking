R AIN clouds rolled in on the mountains and hovered over the rock bank above the coal mine . From the cluster of mine buildings , red brick and gray corrugated steel all turned black , came a deepthroated rumbling . Coal was coming up the shaft , coal was being shaken and cleaned , and vents spewed forth a cloud of smoke and coal dust . Coal dust rained on the company store and coal dust rained on the union hall . Coal dust rained on the garden patches , the rutted streets , the gray company houses in The Flats and on Htmky Hill . At two P. irt. the mine whistle blew , high and thin and lonely . Soon the men came up . Their caps once had been white , their overalls blue , their faces white , but now , at quitting time , they were like blackfacecomedians , black all over , except for their white teeth and the whites of their eyes , and their red lips . Late that night some of them sat drinking beer in a circular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , recording secretary of Local 3648 , United Mine Workers of America , an earnest , intense young man with a thin face and pale arms , was saying , " Hell , the miners are proud of their union . It 's a part of their lives : And they 're proud of Lewis . He can take ' em all on , the whole world . He can meet . with senators and hold his ' ead up . " The others around the table nodded , all but one or two . Hoot Croyle went on , " And when they hear old Winchell and all these guys on the radio that tear their hair and beat their chest about the miners , they get a pride out of it . They do feel that they 're fighting a battle for all American labor ; they 're the shock troops . " He lit a cigarette . " When I started in the , mine there was n't no union here . Our fathers worked without air . We 've got portal to portal ; we 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the best thing the miners ever got . It protects the miner from the cradle to the grave . And if John L. Lewis did n't do another thing in this world , there should be a monument to the man . " Mike Demchak , an aging socialist agitator , said , " It 's the union did it , not Lewis . The miners . " . wrecked Johnstown , killing about 2200 . That ended the idyl . Soon the Berwind-White Company began mining coal . Today , miners hang their dinner buckets in the butlers ' pantries of the millionaires ' homes , and the dam site is a lovers ' lane , and in the bar at the millionaires ' faded hotel miners argue union affairs . Everything , even the town 's water supply , comes from the mine . There is no local government , except the company . And the union . The union has come a long way . Not many years ago in the coal fields men who wanted to start a union had to hide in the woods to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constabulary of the operators  --  drove out agitators , broke strikes and cracked skulls . Courts backed them up . One injunction even forbade striking miners to congregate in their church . Wages were low , hours were long , danger was great , housing was squalid , children were sweated , miners were cheated at store and mine , and so they kept trying to unionize . St. Michael miners joined the UMWA in 1922 and struck . Driven from the company houses , the strike leaders and their families set up tents on the hillside across the creek . In midsummer John L. Lewis abandoned them . Not till November did they give up , defeated . Nationally , the UMWA was beaten into virtual impotence during the late 1920 's . The New Deal saved it . One afternoon in May of 1933 , as the miners at St. Michael emerged from the shaft , they were met by an organizer standing boldly at the tipple , unmolested . Local 3648 has been going strong ever since . No wonder pictures of Franklin Roosevelt still hang in every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world  --  Croatians , Slays , Austrians , Hungarians , a few Poles , Italians , Scots , Englishmen , Welshmen . Before daylight . they walk or ride to the mine ; they descend 750 feet in the cage to the shaft bottom ; they ride the little coal cars back under the mountain to the working places ; and all day long they sit , legs spread flat before them , or in bad places lie on their sides . and dig out the coal with pneumatic pick hammers , and shovel it into cars . They use no mining machines , nor do they blast coal . The coal seam here is rich , but it is low , averaging perhaps three feet  --  in no working place can a man stand up . Though the company maintains high safety standards , coal dust and silica fill men 's lungs , falling rock and moving cars kill and maim . Ask the men why they pursue such a trade , and most will tell you , " Because I 'm too damn dumb to learn anything else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently when he said , " Once I worked in a Dodge assembly plant , where I had nothing to do but wipe the goo-goo off one side of the windshield . I went . back to the coal mine , doing something more important . And besides , you 're more your own boss . " In their considerable spare time , the miners sit around the house and read the paper , or they play pinochle and rummy ( Coni hailed on Page 107 ) WHAT THE MINERS SAY ABOUT JOHN L. LEWIS ( Continued from Page 27 ) under the trees or in the saloons , or they play bocce . They take their wives shopping in Johnstown and South Fork and Beaverdale , maybe going to a baseball game . In the fall they hunt birds and rabbits and deer , and on the day the trout season opens , the mine is as good as closed . At three P.M. the dusty streets , deserted all day when the men were at work , were coming to life . Hoot Croyle 's wife , beleaguered by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen when Hoot came home . He was thirty-four , born a few miles away , of a family for whom the adjoining township was named . His father had been a miner . Hoot had unruly auburn hair , a white complexion , brown eyes , a belligerent undershot jaw . He felt keenly his lack of formal education . He read greedily not only the Congressional Record and books on economics and labor but also novels like James Joyce 's Ulysses . He is secretary of the Workman 's Educational and Social Club , of the local union , and of a sportsman 's club . " The Health and Welfare Fund takes more time than all the rest put together , " he said , putting on a short-sleeved sport shirt and a narrow-brimmed felt hat . " I got to go see a guy now . " He walked down the road and climbed a stony path . On a broad L-shaped porch overlooking the valley , sat Sam Osewalt , a round sad man in an undershirt . He sat in a wheel chair , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine seventeen years ago . He had been twenty then . His industrial-compensation award , the maximum , had amounted to fifteen dollars a week for about ten years . After that , except for $655 in donations from the local union , there had been nothing till Lewis won the Health and Welfare Fund . It pays him sixty dollars a month for life . He said bitterly , but quietly , " The company never even bought me adhesive tape , and , buddy , when you buy a roll of tape now , it 's eighty-five cents at the company store . They thought I 'd be dead M a few weeks . " Osewalt , nervous , wheeled himself to and fro . Hoot held out a thumb-worn copy of the UMWA Journal . " This is what I come to see you about , " he said , and pointed to a headline : REHABILITATION PROGRAM OF WELFARE FUND STARTS PARALYTICS ON ROAD TO NEW LIFE . Osewalt nodded . " I seen it . " Hoot said , " Does that give you new hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of fixing their back up , I do n't know . " " Well , I 'm gon na write in about you and I need your papers . " Osewalt smiled hopefully . " Yeah ? " They talked about fishing , about the new wash house , about the union . And what did Sam Osewalt think of John L. Lewis ? He said , " What do you think I think of John L. Lewis ? " Over in the new part of town , Mike Demchak was sprawled on a davenport , listening to his daughter play the piano while his wife fixed supper . He lived in four rooms , half of a double frame house on the hill at the edge of the woods . Flowered draperies and ace curtains hung at the windows . An old oak , glass-doored bookcase held Mike 's books , his proudest poisessions  --  Plato 's Republic , Dos Passos ' The Big Money , Ingersoll 's lectures , Darwin 's Origin of Species , a history of the UMWA . Beside him , goldfish swam in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , but he had not been able to dig out the particles of coal dust from the fine lines around his eyes , and so black circles ringed his eyes . His cheekbones were wide and high , Slavic ; his hair was dry and black , cropped short . When be was fifteen , his father , an Austrian immigrant , had taken him into the mine " to show me it was no good . " He liked it and stayed . Almost from the beginning he stood up against the bosses for what he considered his rights . He joined the union when to do so was dangerous . An old socialist influenced him greatly . Debs was his idol , still is . He bummed around the country , boxcars and handouts , trying to learn . The union sent him to Brookwood Labor College . He determined to devote his life to the labor movement . But he is independent . At one time or another he has been blacklisted by both company and union . He was president of the local union at St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading influence . " I 'm a dreamer , " he said , reaching over and snapping the radio off . " Idealist . When you take an office in the union , you become conservative . I can do my stuff better from the floor . " He smiled . " I 'm a strike maker . I 'm an agitator . " But for what ? For the movement . What movement ? He gestured with one hand . " The labor movement should be an instrument to bring about a new social order , the co-operative commonwealth . " It was Debs ' phrase of 1895 , and it sounded curiously dated . Mike said , " I 've loaned out books about socialism . But the miners want something right away ; they ca n't wait for the socialist commonwealth . They want their thinking done for them . Lewis thinks for us , " and he grinned . " A lot of the core of Lewis 's hundred per cent backing is from old-time socialists . " Lewis appoints the two key district officers , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they receive , so the miners are always demanding autonomy  --  that is , self-government ? despite threats that to do so will cost them their jobs and union memberships . Local 3648 is always needling the district and the international , putting pressure on congressmen , striking without authorization . Mike said , " Strikes are no darn fun . Wait , I 'll show you , " and he hauled out a batch of pay statements and incometax reports . He earned $3908.16 last year before taxes . " Here 's an average two weeks ' pay , a hundred and seventy dollars and fifty cents . I 'm still a pretty good coal miner , even if I am past fifty . But here we were on strike . I only got sixteen dollars and four cents . " He shook his head . " When this last strike ended , some of the men owed **29;3639;TOOLONG store bills . But even so , I do n't think you could have got one man that would have said no when Lewis said the contract was dishonored . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John L. Lewis and his officers . " Mrs. Demchak , a friendly , strong , rather handsome woman with brown hair and a soft Slavic face , said supper was ready , and Mike padded into the neat kitchen . The two children , young Mike , thirteen , and Marianna , sixteen , were already seated . As Mike and his wife ate  --  pork chops , boiled potatoes , green beans , salad  --  they talked about where their money went . Their rent was only $14.92 a month , but their other expenses equaled a city workman 's . They had about $1000 in war bonds . Mike said , " We been living better than ever before , not like poor people ought to live . We make a lot of trips ? Pittsburgh , Beaverdale , all around . " He motioned toward a cabinet . " Some houses you ca n't find a pencil , paper , magazines , books ; the medicine cabinet 's empty ; we have all that stuff on hand . " His wife said , " We were very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came here  --  new lamps , new rugs , everything . We still need a refrigerator and a new stove , " and she gestured toward the kerosene stove . " That was the strike . That 's why I did n't get my stove . " Mike said , " Well , they dishonored the contract . " His wife said , " But the prices go up when you go on strike . " Mike said , " You do n't understand , Mary . You do n't know why the prices go up , " and he launched a long discussion of price economics . His wife brought the coffeepot and refilled their * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * big white cups . Mike , rubbing his thumb and forefinger along the gold frame of his glasses , said earnestly , " If we win , the others do n't have to strike . " " It puts the whole country out . " " About time too . " " You sound like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of freedom the people there have n't got ? " " I 'm glad to hear you say that , at least . " " ? but if things keep on , they 'll have the workers here in worse shape than in Europe . They sure told the railroad workers how to do . " Mrs. Demchak sighed , " Well , I do feel if there had n't been so many strikes we 'd have been better off . " Mike drove through the gray dusk with Hoot Croyle , his prot  --  g ? . They stopped at Joe Mucko 's house to talk to him about landscaping the war memorial . He was a miner , but his own yard was full of flowers and he was studying horticulture by mail . " I fiftysix , " he said , " but you never too old to learn . I study psychology , geography , I got a cyclopedia , thirty books , astronomy . I 'm intending to get a Government book on cosmic rays ; that 's the newest thing in the field . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mucko 's face was lined and tense around the mouth . Born in . Yugoslavia , he had been digging coal here twenty years . " In those days a man is n't free . Before the union , if you note there 's crookedness in the mine , you protest . The boss is rough , he tell you to take your tools out . He no can do that today ; he has to make a settlement . " Why had he struck last time ? " The contract was dishonored , we decide stay home . John Lewis insists on them old miners get pensions . He might be man of mistakes , nobody 's perfect . But what he did for the miners , like hundred-dollar vacation pay , we notice it . And we 're for him . And I do n't think there 's any crime in it . Of course , " he added , hesitating , " he cause shortage of coal . But always when danger come , he let us go to work . He keep his eye on the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He said , " I 'm satisfied with Lewis . " And what if he were n't ? He grinned . " Pretty hard ; he always win ; it do n't do me any good I do n't like him . " Down the road came Ben Griffin , on his way home.from a late shift , tall and lanky , the only Negro in town . He was a deeply religious , soft-spoken man who raised flowers  --  strange how many of them raise flowers . His teeth flashing white , he said , " If the operators would co-operate , Lewis would n't have to pull us out . The main thing they after is to break up the miners ' union . And the only way we can hold it is to stick together . We do n't want no strike , " he said , speaking slowly . " We do n't want to see the country tied up no worse than nobody else . But that 's the only weapon we got . " Had he encountered much race prejudice here ? " Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the glass . " And here comes Guerrino Guerrieri , called " Greeno . " How does he like Lewis ? " I think he 's pretty good to me , anyhow . I think he 's only guy put up any fight . " What does Greene do with all the leisure time Lewis has won him ? He grinned . " Go up the road , get a couple beers , come back . " Hoot Croyle said , " That 's a good idea , " and he and Mike drove up to Steve Oravecz 's saloon . The young men clustered at the Tong bar , sport shirts and thick shoulders , were arguing about Judge Goldsborough 's " conjunction , " and though there were only about twenty of them in the low-ceilinged room , you had to shout to be heard . Mike and Hoot and some others carried their beers into the deserted dance hall , a quiet place , and sat in a round booth to talk . A kibitzer leaning over the back of the booth asked , " Why do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 've learned they 'll never get anyplace in this world as individuals . " Three or four others had gathered around . Hoot ordered more beer . He drank fast , nervously . He described how he had told off ' the foreman today : " He said it 'd be better if I 'd spend my time with the first-aid team , than running around drinking . I says , ' It 's none o ' your damn business what I do . I understand you got some pretty good stuff in your cellar , too , ' " and he glanced all around and bobbed his head fast . The others laughed ; they loved it . Somebody mentioned John L. Lewis . That started it . Andy , a little roundfaced , red-faced man in a brown felt hat and a shirt with a South Seas design , said , " Well , I do n't know . That last fine . It was his own fault . All he had to do was answer questions . If you ask me to come to your office and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a quarter if I do n't go , I 'd go . " " He was fined for not ordering the men back . " Andy said stubbornly , " I do n't care . If they do it to us many more times , they 'll break the union . And they take it off of us . " Another miner agreed . " Even Lewis 's own twenty-thousand-dollar fine 'll be paid by us . " Hoot said sharply , " Who will bene-fit ? " Another said , " Why should you take the whole licking , Hoot ? Why does Lewis always call a work stoppage , never a strike ? " " Because it looks more spontaneous . " 108 Tru. : SATURIttY EVENING POST jaltatar. 15.1919 " No . Because if he called a genuine strike he 'd have to pay us strike benefits out of his international treasury . " Hoot did n't believe it . Someone said , " It 's in the bylaws and the constitution . I can show it to you , " and the argument swirled around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , who would you trade Lewis for ? " There was a pause ; they were all thinking . One of them said , " Nobody . The labor movement is bankrupt for leadership . " A kibitzer asked , " What if Goldsborough should throw Lewis in jail ? " Immediately they all said , " Then we do not work . " What of the UMWA 's future ? " I do n't know , " groaned Mike . " Lewis is a man who will not tolerate anyone who might take his place . It 's going to be a tragedy when he dies . " Soon ' they left . The tavern was almost deserted . Off in a corner by a pinball game , old Joe Kensek sat alone , a little man with thick black hair and a face livid and seamed , staring straight ahead and complaining he could hardly breathe . It was the silicosis probably , maybe miner 's asthma . He was afraid to have his lungs X-rayed . Thinking of the old days , he smiled , his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink lots , raise hell . No more . I like mining , not tending bar . Mining good work . We got good coal . " John L. Lewis ? " He 's all right to certain extent . But that damn certain extent is gon na run out someday . Someday they 're gon na want to work for what they want , not what he wants . " At the front of the long , narrow , lowceiling union hall sat the officers of the local , papers spread out on a plain plank table . Framed photographs of John L. Lewis and all the high-collared international presidents since 1890 looked down on them , and on the wall , too , hung a charter of affiliation with the Pennsylvania Federation of Labor . Mike said , laughing , " We have n't got around to taking it . down since Lewis disaffiliated us . " About seven P.M. the rows of chairs and backless benches started filling up with old miners in black hats and sweaters and pipes , with young miners in corduroy jackets and sport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dozen or so . But there 's a big crowd tonight ; the door prize is thirty-three dollars . " The local gives a three-dollar door prize each week , and if the winner isn't. present , it goes into a jack pot . The local president , Mike Slanoc , banged the table , and Hoot read the . minutes of the Inst meeting too rapidly for sense , though you could catch a string of figures . " Certificates of benefit from the Health and Welfare Fund , sixty dollars a month for twelve months to Soand-So ; seventy dollars a month for twelve months to So-and-So ; thirty-three dollars and thirty-two cents a month ? " A hum of voices drifted up from the barroom below . Hoot ran through correspondence received , old business , his voice loud and curt . He read an appeal from a society to help t he blind , and Mike Demchak , standing against one wall in his best blue-gray suit , and necktie , said , " I move we send ' em five dollars . " It carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " We talked with the superintendent . He wants to pay sixty cents a yard for taking up eight feet of bottom . " An uproar ensued . Hoot cried , " Sixty cents wo n't even pay for the powder ! " and others agreed noisily . The president. , big Mike Slanoc , said , " That 's right ; the hell with it . You tell him the brothers are not gon na do it . " The trustees reported . They had visited the family of Clem McCloskey , who had been hurt in the mine . " She told us last night they had nothing in the house to eat at all . " Mike Demchak said , " Do we have any money in the fund that goes to charity ? " " Twenty-five dollars , " said the treasurer . " Move we give ' em twenty dollars ' worth of groceries . " Somebody said , " Amend it ; make it . groceries from any store but the company store that shut off their credit . " The treasurer interrupted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five dollars to the blind and take thirty-three for the door prize . " Confused discussion produced a solution : Transfer twentyfive dollars from the general fund to the sinking fund . President Slanoc sweated through the rules of order ; the McCloskeys would get the groceries . The men were scraping their feet . restlessly . Slanoc said , " Any other new business ? Any complaints on the mine ? " A big man called , " The whole mine 's a complaint . " Laughter , and an old man shook a cigar box , and a hush fell over the room ; he withdrew a slip of paper and called , " Louis Roberts . " No answer . Next week ? jack pot : thirty-six dollars . Chairs scraped , feet scraped , men talked , and cool night air rushed into the room . Nearly half the men went downstairs to the club barroom . It was a big square room , pipes hanging low over the chrome-and-red chairs , its ceiling supported by steel posts , its floor linoleum . Hoot , Mike , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wall . While the waitress brought beer , Hoot was saying , " Sure we have n't got much democracy in our union . But remember , before we had a union we never had much intimate contact with democracy . " The others talked about what was wrong with the union . Mike Demchak sat back in silence . All at once his chair banged down and he said angrily , " Unions are the holy of the holiest ! The labor movement you fellows joined was already built for you ! " His voice was contemptuous . hurt , and he talked about his lifelong battle for the workers , but the young men listened uncomfortably , their faces cold and hard . To the table came a tall , spare , middle-aged miner in a blue-serge suit , Jim Patterson ; and Mike Demchak greeted him warmly . " Now we got everything . I 'm a socialist and here 's a conservative Democrat . Let 's hear what Jim 's got to say about John L. Lewis , for instance . You think he 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pipe . " In some ways . But the constitution says that any miner in good standing with the endorsement of five locals can run for that job . " Mike laughed . Patterson said , " I know . But just the same it 's true . Next question . " " What about all these strikes ? Prices ? Public interest ? " " Commodities got to come down . They 'll drive us into depression . High wages will do it too . I have no solution . We 're all human . The only way to solve the problem is to take the animal , the greed , out of us . You 'll never do that . " Mike said , " What about the public interest in a coal strike ? " Patterson nodded . " Public sentiment 's pretty much always against . the miners . But in ? this pension fight I do believe we had the majority with us . Anyway , if coal is so vital and the country has to have it ? and if I 'm good enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should receive some consideration . We have in the neighborhood of one thousand killed every year . And we have double that amount of permanent injuries . That , the public never takes into consideration . " He had been forty-two years in the mines , twenty years in this same mine . And what did his union mean to him ? " In plain words , our bread and butter , " he said , smiling . And then , serious-faced , " You go back to 1865 , Lincoln freed the slaves . Previous to that , we barely knew the meaning of freedom . And I do think union helps to keep you free . Because the only mistake old Abe made , he freed the slaves , but he did n't do anything to the drivers ; he left them alone . And they 're still here . " Mike looked at the old octagonal clock above the bar . " We got to meet ( Continued itrt Page 110 ) Wee ea , .. ' nun a train in Johnstown . Is that daylightsaving time ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed . " You ought to hear what my wife says about the miners : too damn contrary even to go on the same time as everybody else . " He and Hoot left . The car climbed a hill , and the lights of St. Michael , strung out up the valley beyond the mine , vanished . Mike , driving cautiously , was saying , " When I did that talking , I was n't of
