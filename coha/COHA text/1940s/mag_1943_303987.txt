Last week the sometimes gloomy subject of the postwar world got a laugh at last . Out of Britain came the most amusing satire of World War II . Called The Adventures of the Young Soldier in Search of the Better World ( Faber &; Faber , 6s. ) , it is a breezy but atrabilious burlesque at the expense of postwar plan ners . Author : Britain 's bearded , ebullient Cyril Edwin Mitchinson Joad , who in the last ten years has espoused pacifism , Mosleyism , polygamy , socialism , appeasement , Christianity , spiritualism , hedonism . He has also written some earnest , reputable books of philosophy , become one of the most popular members of the British Broadcasting Corp . ' s " Brains Trust " ( Britain 's Information Please ) . <P> The book owes much of its punch to Illustrator Mervyn Peake , whose line drawings ( see cut , p. 101 ) blend Tenniel fantasy with George Grosz bitters . <P> Cripps and the Devil . Satirist Joad 's Young Soldier is " a fine specimen of young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than is sometimes found among those who have emerged from the valley of the shadow of middle-class education . " When his adventures begin , he has just been listening , in his mess , to a broadcast by Sir Stafford Cripps on What We Are Fighting For . Sir Stafford said we are fighting to make a better and happier world . The Young Soldier thinks that is very nice , wonders how it is to be brought about . He decides to collect his thoughts during a walk . Out of the bosky underbrush pops the Devil in the person of Captain Percy Nick ( Per-Cynic ) . The Devil , Heaven 's most unsuccessful politician , laughs at the Young Soldier for worrying about Politician Cripps and at all talk of a better world emerging from the war . " When the devil was sick , " he misquotes Rabelais , " the devil a saint would be . When the devil was well , the devil a saint was he . " <P> Next the young man encounters an orating windbag , Mr. Speakeasy , M.P. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pensive soldier . He is also unmoved by the frenzied screechings of Mr. Escapegoat , the diplomat , and the Rev. Hateman , the cleric , who unite in a Vansittart diatribe about German savagery and sing a duet : " The Germans are not the Herrenvolk . We are the Herrenvolk . ... " <P> Mr. Ema and Miss Ame . Then the Young Soldier meets fat , jolly Mr. Transportouse ( Transport House is the head quarters of Britain 's conservative labor leaders , loathed by leftish Laborites ) , who genially expounds the wonders that will come from Labor Party gradualism . He takes out of a box two tiny human figures - Mr . Ema ( Education for the Masses ) and Miss Ame ( Ministress for Amenities ) . They deliver pretty speeches about classless education and beautiful laborsaving apartments for all . This meeting slightly lifts the Young Soldier 's spirits . He hurries past a gesticulating Robot mechanically expounding Marxism and predicting Capitalism 's postwar collapse . <P> But the Young Soldier is dismayed by Red-tape Worm , a bureaucrat . Red-tape Worm predicts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditioned soon after birth . Tiny ivory radio sets will be inserted in each skull so the authorities can learn what people think , can flash thoughts into each citizen 's head . Worm also predicts that Government will provide for every possible human need .
