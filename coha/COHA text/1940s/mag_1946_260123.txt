One evening last week , The Company of Four , a London longhair repertory group , presented Jean Cocteau 's Azrael ( English title : The Eagle Has Two Heads ) , * Next morning Londoners learned that whatever might be said about the play ( and little was said in its favor ) , a young woman named Eileen Herlie , of whom few had ever heard before , was a Great Actress . <P> In many another city , wise theatergoers would have put that one down in salt and waited for the still greater new actress of week-after-next . But since London 's theatrical critics are perhaps the least effusive group of professionals on earth , there was a distinct possibility that young Miss Herlie was probably not far short of the 18th Century 's Mrs. Siddons . <P> Wrote bespectacled , courtly Ernest Betts ( Daily Express ) , who can be as tough as molybdenum : " A great tragic performance . . . . She has an extraordinary range of expression-from bitter sophistication to tragic emotion , and again , to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grant : " A magnificent . . . performance in a specious play . . . . " Wrote George Bishop of the Daily Telegraph : " . . . Magnificent poise ... the dignity of a queen . . . . " The News Chronicle 's hard-eyed Alan Dent : " Eileen Herlie 's powerful , central and splendid performance makes us long to see her in something saner . " The often hard-boiled Noel Coward said simply : " We have seen the birth of a great tragic actress . " <P> <P> Dark-haired , full-blown , 27-year-old Eileen Herlie ( ne O'Herlihy ) is the Scotch-Irish daughter of a small businessman in Glasgow . Until last week her career has been much like that of most other young actresses . As a little girl she always hogged the starring roles in re-enactments of movies ; as a teen-ager she met stern opposition from her parents when she wanted to play-act for keeps . Her tribulations as a typist were anesthetized by amateur theatricals ; as soon as she saved a little money she fled to London for " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shillings a week and job-hunting through the blitz . <P> Through fellow Glaswegian Paul Vincent Carroll ( Shadow &; Substance ) she finally landed a job as an understudy in The Divorce of Lady X. The producer of her next show , East Lynn , proposed after three days ' acquaintance , but she decided to wait " a decent interval , " got around to marrying him three weeks later . Only this year she joined the talented little group which calls itself The Company of Four . <P> Critics were eager to see Eileen Herlie in something less artificial than Cocteau in order to check their judgments . Hollywood is interested in her , too , but she wants to " dabble quietly before taking the plunge . " The big money does hot excite her ; she lives quite comfortably on her 20 a week-top pay for The Company of Four-shares a house with two other women , a composer and a ballet dancer . The " horrible din " of their combined professional exercises doubtless explains why husband Philip Barrett continues to produce his road shows . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waking hour . Result : she is absent from the gay night life of London 's West End . <P> <P> * A play that Manhattan is scheduled to see this season-with Tallulah Bankhead as lead .
