When New Jersey 's Millionaire Senator Albert Hawkes arrived in Washington six years ago , the late Minority Leader Charles McNary took a look at his record and remarked : " His economic thinking goes back to B.C. " Last week New Jersey 's G.O.P. machine decided that it was time to update . With the full approval of up- &-coming; Governor Alfred Driscoll , state G.O.P. leaders unanimously resolved : " Senator Hawkes has little if any prospects of re-election and would be rendering a notable service to the state and nation were he to withdraw his candidacy . " <P> In Hawkes 's place , they nominated as their candidate David Van Alstyne , 51 , OF Englewood , majority leader in the state senate and wealthy Wall Street broker . But Hawkes did not want to quit . Crying " a threat to our free primary system , " he announced that he would run anyway .
