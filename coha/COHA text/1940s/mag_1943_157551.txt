The Civil Aeronautics Board last week approved a strategic air transport deal : the purchase by United Air Lines of a 75% interest in Mexico 's twelve-year-old , 1,675-mile Lineas Aereas Mineras , S.A. LAMSA connects Mexico City with the U.S.* and with eleven important cities across the rich center of Mexico . Thus the one U.S. domestic airline which joined hands with Pan American Airways in sponsoring the " chosen instrument " policy for international flying after the war ( TIME , Aug. 23 ) became the first ( except for American 's direct flights to Mexico City ) to compete with Pan Am below the Rio Grande . <P> Up to now , LAMSA has had a pretty tough time . From 1938 through last March it ended up with a net loss of 273,000 pesos ( $56,500 ) , and its present book value is only some $32,000 . But United thought LAMSA 's prospects were worth $145,750 for 3,750 shares of stock . UAL also announced that it would sink $1,000,000 more in improvements . <P> CAB 's cautious approval was for " air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if LAMSA extends its operations beyond the borders of Mexico . " United officials insisted they had no further ambitions-not even for a new San Diego-to-Nogales route to link the two lines directly . But there was scarcely an airman alive who did not predict : 1 ) sooner or later LAMSA would compete with Pan Am in more than one Good Neighbor country , and 2 ) that when it asked for permission to do so , CAB would give it another green light . <P> <P> * At Ciudad Juarez , across the border from El Paso , and at Nogales on the Arizona line .
