txt Nowhere else , perhaps , is the term " cartel " regarded with the professed abhorrence that characterizes its status in American public opinion . Yet , we are periodically reminded at this time of year that our own Federal Government , acting in behalf of a small segment of American agriculture and a small segment of American industry , conducts one of the tightest and most monopolistic cartels to be found anywhere in the world . This is the cartel set up to subsidize the domestic sugar industry under the Sugar Act of 1948 . Under this Act " domestic " producers 1who include not only growers on the mainland but in Hawaii , Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands ) are assigned a combined quota of 4,268,000 tons annually , although they consistently fall short of reaching that figure . The difference between the total of the domestic quotas and the estimated total consumption for the ensuing year is allocated under an import quota system to Cuba and other non-domestic suppliers . It is the task of the Secretary of Agriculture to provide the consumption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need hardly be said , a key figure . If it is set too low it means higher prices for the producers and a squeeze for the country 's consumers . Complicating the Secretary 's job are the considerations he is instructed to keep in mind ? considerations which run at times head-on into one another . These include : the current level of sugar consumption ; whether there is a deficiency or surplus in sugar inventories ; trends in population and consumer demand , and the current cost of living compared with that of 1947 . At the end of last month the Secretary of Agriculture listened to the testimony of spokesmen for both producers and consumers as a preliminary to reaching his initial estimate of 1949 consumption . As might have been expected , the ideas of the two groups were far apart . Representatives of the producers urged the Secretary to set the figure in the neighborhood of 7,200,000 to 7,250,000 tons , a level which , they said , was needed to maintain a reasonable level of prices in 1950 . Representatives of the industrial users of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set at a little under 8,100,000 tons . Sugar consumption in 1949 has run far ahead of the 7,500 , - 000 tons which was the final basis of import quotas . In 1948 Clinton Anderson , who was then Secretary of Agriculture , first set the consumption total at 7,800,000 tons . This was later revised downward three times , with the final figure 7,200,000 . Secretary Brannan , on the other hand , started out a year ago with a 1949 forecast of 7,250,000 tons , or 250,000 tons below actual 1948 consumption . He had to boost his estimate later in the year . Spokesmen for the nation 's big consumers maintain that on the whole the 1948 law has been so administered as to exercise a restrictive influence on the use of sugar . Although this does n't seem to be reflected in the trend of prices , the figures on per capita consumption lend support to the argument . For , despite the fact that purchasing power in the United States is far above the level of the late Thirties and that general food consumption has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year was but ninety-three pounds , as compared with ninety-seven pounds for the years 1935-39.
