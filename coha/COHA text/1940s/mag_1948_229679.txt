When Polish Premier Josef Cyrankiewicz got home from Moscow last week , fellow officials were waiting at the station . They thrust a bouquet of red carnations into his hands the moment the train screeched to a stop . . . The red posies were justified . Moscow had promised Cyrankiewicz a dazzling price for Poland 's abstention from the Marshall Plan : a five year , billion-dollar trade agreement-plus a $450 million credit ( the largest ever granted by the Soviet Union ) and immediate delivery of 200,000 tons of Soviet grain . <P> Close up , the deal looked even better . The Russians promised heavy machinery , including electrical equipment , chemical and automobile assembly plants , a big steel works . They were all items of which Russia herself was short . <P> The Warsaw radio purred : " There is a vast difference between the Marshall Plan and the brotherly help of the U.S.S.R. The U.S.S.R. gives us what we really need . . . . " Moscow had reason to be satisfied , too . Russia was getting , over the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sugar , zinc and rolling stock . <P> Socialist Premier Cyrankiewicz was smugly happy himself . At the customary Kremlin banquet , more than half the members of the busy Politburo had turned up-an unusual honor . Moreover , he had had an hour 's visit with Stalin , who was in a big-brotherly mood . What had they talked about ? Soon after the Polish mission got back , accounts began to go around : they had chattered about the world situation and about left-wing socialism ; Stalin believed that there was a place for socialists in a " people 's democracy " if they stay far enough left ; Stalin did not believe there would be a war and he thought the economic plans of the West would fail .
