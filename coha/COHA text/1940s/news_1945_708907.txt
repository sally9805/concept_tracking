txt With 's army in disarmed Japan and Eisenhower 's army in conquered GerMany , Secretary Forrestal 's pre ' tense in his letter to Sen. Walsh that any evidence , in the martyrdom of Adm . Kimmel and Gen. ' Short needs to be concealed in the national interest is a palpable fraud . We will suspect that any one who upholds this pretense is party to the terrible conspiracy which has already been completely exposed . This conspiracy , to which ? President Roosevelt and Secretaries Hull , Knox , and Stimson were the principal parties , i ! fully set up in the reports of the navy and army investigations . The conspiracy was to tempt and force Japan into an attack upon American possessions . Tc this end the navy in the Pacific ocean was reduced from its dominating power to one of inferiority . This fleet in turn was split in two , with the Japanese navy . b et ween the fractions where it could mass against either one . Then , without conIsulting the senate , an ultimatum , known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conspirators knew - by Nov , ' . 25 that the ultimatum ' would not be accepted . At that time they expected that the helpless troops in the Philippines and Guam would be the victims , but did nothing to save them . At 10 p. m. , Washington time Dec. 6 , more than 15 hours before the attack ' was delivered , the conspirators learned that war was unavoidable and imminent . This information , by explicit order , was withheld that night from Chief of Naval Operations Stark and Gen. Marshall , the army chief of staff . On the morning of the 7th , still several hours before the Japs reached their target , it was known the attack would ? come that day at a moment when it was still night in the Philippines but dawn in Hawaii . It was pointed out that the attack would therefore be delivered upon ' Pearl Harbor . When Adm . Stark was finally apprised of all this two and a half hours before the known hour of the attack , he said : " My God , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once . " But he did not do so . Gen. Marshall also was informed two hours and a half before the attack . He had on his desk a secret telephone with which he could have reached Gen. Short instantly . He had at his disposal the navy short wave radio with which he could have reached Kimmel and Short in a few minutes . In these vital moments he omitted to use these normal and speedy means of communication , and had recourse to a code message sent by commercial cable not marked rush . The warning was too late . Here we have ample testimony to exonerate Adm . Kimmel and Gen. Short and to convict President - Roosevelt and Secretaries Hull , Knox , and Stimson of conspiracy to have our forces attacked in the Philippines , Guam , Wake Island , and Hawaii , and of withholding from them that fact . Secretary Forrestal 's secret information is not needed . He and , more particularly , those he is vainly trying to protect are convict esl without it . Adm . Kimmel and Gen. Short are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
