txt The The committee acted at the close of a three-day hearing in which it was brought out that Mr. Eisler , a composer who had been working in Hollywood in motion pictures , was permitted to enter the United States without reservation in October of 1940 despite strong ideological suspicions raised against him . The evidence disclosed that many prominent Americans , among them Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt , had interceded in 1939 in behalf . of Mr. Eisler 's long efforts to find lodgment in this country , in the belief that he was a talented musician deserving sanctuary from the Nazis and was not a Communist . Mrs. Roosevelt in 1939 wrote twice to Sumner Welles , then Under-Secretary of State , about . the Eisler case . George S. Messersmith , then an Assistant Secretary of State , wrote to the Consulate General in Havana , the point to which the Eislers were then directing their appeals , that there was no reason to bar Mr. Eisler as a ' Communist unless there was " definite and convincing proof . " His brother , Gerhart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the principal Communist agent operating in the United States , was convicted in Federal Court here Aug. 15 for passport fraud . Sentence was deferred pending a motion for a new trial . He had previously been sentenced to one year in prison and a $1,000 fine for contempt of Congress , resulting from his refusal to take the oath to testify . Gerhart , who is 51 , was represented before the House committee as an agent of Communist realpolitik . He defied his inquisitors sitors from the outset . Johannes Eisler , who is 49 , was represented as one of the world leaders of cultural communism , specifically in music , and had been so described , it was brought out , in Communist publications . He took 1 an attitude the opposite to that of his brother ; he refused to answer no question although he parried many . Good Faith Scored Anew The introduction into the Johannes Eisler case of high personages , and a committee decision not to call the one obscure consular official who was shown actually to have opened wide the door to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committee 's good faith as the three-day session ended . Norman M. Littell , who acted as counsel for Mr. Welles and Mr. Messersmith , denounced the omission of the testimony of this consular official , Willys Myers of the station at Mexicali , Mexico . He declared it was " complete confirmation " of his earlier assertions that " the Welles-Messersmith-Mrs . Roosevelt correspondence had absolutely no significance or relationship to the fact that Eisler got into the country . " Referring to the fact that Mr. Eisler obtained no visa at Havana , and that nothing was said to kiggest that Mr. Myers in Mexicali had ever been importuned , Mr. Littell declared : " The conclusion is irresistible that no ' Washington pressure ' resulted in granting visas to the Eislers . " Mr. Littell , a former assistant attorney general , also attacked the committee for the fact that the name of JoSephus Daniels , the former Ambassador to Mexico , was brought into this morning 's proceedings . Paul Churchill Hutton , who as a visa officer in the Mexico City consulate in 1939 granted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was the witness at the time . Mr. Hutton testified that he had , by request , prepared for Mr. Daniels a memorandum on the Eisler case , at the time their application for a visa was pending at Mexico City , but had never been asked actually to present it to the Ambassador . Mr. Littell , who told reporters that this was " a contemptible misuse " by the committee of " an honored name , " earlier had come to the press table to make this state-ment : " I am authorized by Mr. Daniels to gay : 1 . That Mrs. Roosevelt never communicated with him at any time- about Eisler. 2 . That he has no recollection whatever of the name Eisler , until seeing it of late in the papers . 3 . That , naturally , in his Embassy in Mexico City thousands of people wrote to him and that in courtesy and custom he replied to them . " This latter referred to the fact that Robert Stripling , the committee counsel , had brought out from Mr. Hutton that " two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had written to Mr. Daniels in behalf of Mr. Eisler , and that the Ambassador had directed replies to be sent . Julian Bryant was identified by committee counsel as a lecturer for The New Masses , a Communist publication , and a conductor of tours to the Soviet Union . Chairman J. Parnell Thomas , Republican , of New Jersey , declared from the bench , however : " There is nothing in our records to show that Julian Bryant is a Communist . " s , Mr. who announced the committee 's written findings , declared that it had been decided not to call Mr. Myers as a witness becatise he " would n't add anything at all . " He added that while both the State Department and the Immigration officials had been censured , " there 's no question that the State Department was more at fault than anybody else . " The committee report , approved unanimously by all four members who attended , technically as a subcommittee , did not mention Mrs. Roosevelt 's name . It said that there was no in tention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sumner Welles or any one of the State Department officials involved had pro-I Communist sympathies . " " The record is clear of this , " it went on . " But the committee definitely of the opinion that , i through the influence and pressure ) exerted by certain prominent people , efforts were made to manipulate the immigration laws to such ' an extent that in the final analysis the principal point at issue , communism , was entirely overlooked and the immigration case resolved itself into a mere determination of whether Eisler was a professor within the meaning of the law . " This was a reference to the fact that the final authority over the ' whole affair , an immigrations appeals board in Washington , at length held that Mr. Eisler had established certain qualifications as a professor that entitled him to non-quota , or favored , status as an immigrant . The committee asserted that it had been " shown beyond doubt that Hanns Eisler was not only a ' mere ' member of the Communist party , as he has testified , but that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Soviet Union for many years . " " The record is clear , " the report went on , " that Eisler perjured his way in and out of the United States at win , going to Soviet Russia and other countries whenever he pleased . " The record shows that finally , during the war , Eisler was given a haven , and a very lucrative one , in the United States , although it was clearly indicated that he could have found refuge in Moscow , London or Mexico . " Messersmith Is Accused Mr. Messersmith was accused of having " attempted to explain away his actions " by testifying that a 1939 State Department paper flatly calling Mr. Eisler " a Communist " had been prepared by an employe of questionable " objectivity , " R. C. Alexander . " In the opinion of the committee , " the report added , " this is no defense , for the most casual investigation by the State Department , immigration authorities or any other agency would have exposed Eisler beyond a doubt as an international Communist agent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employe , Mr. Alexander , had been followed , Eisler would never have been permitted to enter the United States to carry out his international Communist assignments . " The evidence indicated this sequence of events in the persistent and finally successful efforts of the Eislers to come into the United States as permanent residents : 1 . Sept. 7 , 1939 , a two-months visitors ' permit , issued by Mr. Hutton at Mexico City , which they extended to a year while being sought by immigration authorities . 2 . Sept. 20 , 1940 , a non-quota visa issued by Mr. Myers at Mexicali. 3 . Sept. 20 , 1940 , the rejection of this Asa by Immigration Officer Clarence R. Porter at Calexico , on the American side , and a local rejection of Mr. Eisler 's appeal . 4 . Oct. 21 , 1940 , a sustaining of the Eisler appeal by an immigration board in Washington made up , as testified to by Joseph Savoretti of the Immigration Service , of " Messrs . Seward , Finucane and Charles . " 5 . Oct. 22 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
