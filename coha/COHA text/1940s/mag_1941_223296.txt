One cloudy October morning , a long line of women in shawls , some of them holding babies , formed before a tenement in the slums of Brooklyn . When the doors were flung open , a young nurse with red hair welcomed the women in . Thus did Mrs. Margaret Sanger open the first U.S. birth-control clinic , 25 years ago last week . <P> For eight days , hundreds of mothers crowded the little clinic . But on the ninth day came a woman " large of build and hard of countenance " -a police spy . Next day the clinic was raided . Mrs. Sanger and her sister , Mrs. Ethel Byrne , who helped her , were sentenced to 30 days on Blackwell 's Island for " operating a public nuisance . " Sister Ethel went on a hunger strike , was the first woman to be fed forcibly in U.S. prison history . When the case was appealed Mrs. Sanger lost , but the way was opened for physicians to give birth-control advice . After she was released she stumped up &; down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , found time to raise three children . <P> Last week in Manhattan , a crowd of notables celebrated the 25th anniversary of Mrs. Sanger 's clinic . They noted with pride that : 1 ) there are now more than 620 contraceptive centers all over the country , serving millions of women in 46 States ( distributing birth-control information is still illegal in Massachusetts and Connecticut ) ; 2 ) in a recent Gallup poll , 77% of U.S. citizens favored the teaching of contraception through Government health clinics . <P> Because of this success , the Birth Controllers have recharted their course , turned fertilitarian . Worried by the long-trend fall of the birthrate , they dropped their old cry of " limited " families . Instead , they urged U.S. parents to have as many babies as they can afford , to " space " them two years apart . To show they meant it , last year they changed the name of their Journal of Contraception . Its new title : Human Fertility . <P> Last fortnight 13,000,000 people in the U.S. sneezed , wheezed and sniffled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans to ask the U.S. about its colds every fortnight this year .
