txt Letters to The Times ROBERT MOSES.KAAREL R. PUSTA SR.HARRY EMERSON FOSDICK.SIDNEY HOOK.M.G . Letters . to The Times New York Site for U. N. Commissioner Moses Upholds Plan for World Capital Here To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : You printed on Oct. 31 a letter as to the Flushing Meadow site from a committee of domestic long - range planners headed by Talbot Hamlin . Mayor O'Dwyer and the members of his committee and consultants have already stated why , in their opinion , a new world capital on virgin territory in the suburbs of this city would be expensive , unpopular and unworkable . This letter is addressed to a statement repeated twice in their communication to the effect that it is outrageous on the part of the present city administration to offer to give away park land in the Borough of Queens where parks are " few , small and far between . " The parks and playgrounds of Queens , due to intensive efforts during the last thirteen years , are not few , small and far between . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to be filled , but these gaps are not in the northeasterly area where we have Flushing Meadow , the Kissena Corribut a direct and significant aspect , is the crying need for public information and understanding which this situation reveals . Plainly , we face the possibility of repeating the tragic pattern of the VD epidemic that followed the first World War unless this need for education is met and citizen activity and support for a broad program of social hygiene  --  covering the stillneglected preventive side  --  undertaken . An immediate remedy is at hand . The channels of action are open . The Stamp Out VD Campaign of the American Social Hygiene Association , now under way , offers an immediate opportunity for all who wish to do their part to do it now . The $300,000 to be raised will be spent on new health-promoting services here in New York . Contributions should be sent to the association at 1790 Broadway , New York 19 , N. Y. Support it compellingly in the public interest . To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " feel themselves today a happy and proud people . They should be happy to know that their daring exploit in crossing thousands of miles in tiny boats has not been in vain , and their trust in the generosity of the American people and their Government was not misplaced . They should be proud that their courage and determination has been put in line , in a most feeling manner by the President , with the pioneering spirit which had built the United States . They will certainly never forget that their admission to America will be performed only by strength of a humane interpretation of the existing rigid immigration law . - We must hope , that their case may help to dispose the American Congress and public opinion toward a general modification of the immigration rules pertaining to political refugees , as announced by President Truman . As a resident of the United States and compatriot of the Norfolk and Miami ocean travelers , I was much affected by the gracious gesture of the President , and impressed by the attitude of the American press , which did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adventurers of freedom as a principle of justice and equity . The editorial " A Reprieve for the Inanda " in the Oct. 25 issue of THE TIMES is a fine illustration of that liberal spirit , which justifies the hope that the United States , initiator of the Atlantic Charter and the Four Freedoms , would take the lead for a general settlement of the refugee and displaced persons problem . There seems to be no alternative but verbose or misleading declarations and , hence , despair of a worthy people who believe in their right to asylum and ask only to live and work in liberty under God and law . KAAREL R. PUSTA SR . ' Sea Cliff , L. I. , Oct. 31 , 1946 . Information on Venereal Disease To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The alarming increase in venereal disease that has followed the close of the war is cause for concern among all public-spirited New Yorkers . After a war in which we brought VD down to an all-time low , New York now has a 29 per cent increase over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to public health is self-evident . Less easily perceived , the same claim , and invokes the same maxim according , to which any act is justified when , in its eyes , it furthers the declared end . But if we judge other regimes not by what they say about themselves but by their deeds , why not apply the same standard to the Soviet regime ? There is a voluble group of professional friends of the Soviet Government which cries out against any criticism of Russian policy in foreign affairs as an attempt to " disparage " cused of " making the atomic bomb a threatening factor in diplomacy , " " unilateral action in Japan , " " intervention in Brazil 's election campaign by the American Ambassador , " together with other items in the familiar litany of charges to be found in Pravda . This public letter concludes : " All these objective appraisals add up to the Soviet Union 's present skeptical attitude towardAnglo-American deeds , as contrasted with Anglo-Saxon words . " I am not contesting the right of Mr. Pope and his friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it , to challenge the good faith of those who apply the same test of deeds to Soviet Russia 's words would seem to indicate that Mr. Pope seeks rights and privileges for himself which he would deny to others . SIDNEY 1-100K . Brooklyn . Oct 25t. 1946 Legion of Honor Awarded to Chefs To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Miss Nickerson , in her article on Escoffier , in THE TIMES recently , wrote that no other French chef has been decorated with the Legion of Honor for his services to French cooking . At least one other has been , Montagne . His superb small Paris restaurant with its modest tabard , " Montagne , Traiteur , " as one might say in Americanese , " Montagne  --  Eats , " stood , until about fifteen years ago , at the corner of the Rue St. Honore , and , I think , the Rue des Echelles . Boulestin of Covent Garden , London , was , I believe , another . Research might reveal that a few more chefs , ranging from Lyon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red ribbon of la Patrie reconnaissante . G.
