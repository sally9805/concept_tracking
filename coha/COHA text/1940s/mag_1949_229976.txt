In Ohio , when a jury finds a man guilty of a capital crime , the death penalty is mandatory unless the jury recommends mercy . The first jury that heard Cecil Yankey 's trial for the crowbar murder of 71-year-old Leroy Woodland in 1947 could n't reach a verdict . Yankey agreed to plead guilty , was sentenced to life imprisonment by a one-judge court . <P> After 2 years in the Ohio Penitentiary at Columbus ( where he spent his spare time studying law ) , Yankey decided he could do better , asked for a second jury trial on a technicality : since he had been sentenced without a jury conviction , he was entitled to be sentenced by a three-judge panel . He won a new trial . Last week , the same crime brought 41-year-old Cecil Yankey a second verdict . Said a Highland County murder jury : " Guilty " - with no recommendation of mercy .
