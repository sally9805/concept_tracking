. I HE spot the lone horseman chose for recon-JI naissance commanded a magnificent view . He could see for dozens of miles . At his back , the shaggy Montosos shut off the sky . But to his left and below , Divide Camp lay only half-hidden among pifions and junipers . And straight ahead the San Augustine Plains walked away to a hundred-mile horizon which in the far distance was the blue of mountains meeting sky . It was mid-December . The night , even close to a roaring fire , had been bitter . But now the cloudless New Mexico morning seemed warm . Jacket opened at the throat , Lon Danley steadied his binoculars . The nearest herd , he noted , was perhaps two miles away . The noise of it had been rising in his ears , the bawling of half a thousand steers , softened by distance , seeming strangely like cathedral music . They were George Farr 's cattle , Danley guessed ; Farr ran some 2500 head on his sprawling rough range over to the south . Riders allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along , yet kept them bunched and headed toward the Divide . They 'd water at the tank around midafternoon , Danley knew , and then they 'd graze on slowly till bedding down . Farr did n't hold with the easy wayof throwing them into a stout corral and rolling up for a night 's sleep . He 'd night-herd . The outfit 's mule-drawn chuck wagon had gone on ahead and was out of sight , but the dozen or so extra horses in the remada grazed along separately a little to one side . Danley noted through the glasses that a second herd was coming up rather fast . They were n't more than five miles from where he sat . Practically a traffic jam , be thought . He could n't be sure at the distance , but he thought they were Crockett Morrison'e stuff , probably a mixed lot bound for Texas . He saw a fly crawling slowly through the brush to one side , and when he put the glasses on it , he identified it as the pickup truck that Crockett used for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Danley 's glasses picked up still another herd . This one , however , was far behind , maybe fifteen miles , and Dan-ley thought it might be C-Bar-N or S-Circle stuff or something from Red Lake Ranch or the Lynch Brothers ' outfit ; it could be any of a dozen . And then Danley 's glasses picked up something else . Off to one side was another bunch , either moving slowly or not at all . These were no cattle . Sheep . A thousand head or more . Lon smiled a little to himself as he focused on the unconscious camp tender in greasy coat and a month 's growth of beard , who , totally unaware that anyone 's eyes were on him , was loading his leisurely burros for a shift of camp . The herder , some distance off , was leaning on a stick near a huge rock , doing nothing . All of a sudden Danley saw something else . Two , five , twelve , sixteen flying figures crossed the glass . They skimmed the ground faster and more gracefully than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ band of wild antelope at play . Danley chuckled a little , appreciatively . For them , no riders and no herders , ever . This scene , at which Lon Danley , district grazier for the United States Grazing Service , was taking an official look , was a fairly busy day on the oddest highway in the United States . You could call it a superhighway . Nothing of gasoline , thousands of pounds of rubber needed to bring Hitler and Hirohito to heel . Furthermore , it would have cost the owners thousands of dollars extra , and most of the animals would have arrived with less meat on their bones . To understand why the driveway , in this day of high-octane gasoline , is not an anachronism , but practically the latest thing , remember what yesterday on the range was like . Parts of it were a bloody battlefield ; vast areas were threatened with ruin from overgrazing . The Government was far away and seldom heard from . A man could do as he pleased if he had nerve and a quick trigger . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the range . But it 's done legally , through Government agencies . And today , while some conflicts and risks remain , most of them are passing . Old ways have been deeply modified , production operations have been made far more secure . And the driveway is a striking symbol of all these changes and improvements . One of the hazards of earlier days was the risk of driving across ranges claimed by men who disliked having their ranges crossed . There was often good reason for that dislike . Some tramp sheepmen , for example , would go wherever there was grass , no matter who claimed it One man in New Mexico is said to have owned 35,000 sheep and two sections of land . He 'd send his sheep toward the mountains in the spring and back again in the fall . They made only two or three miles a day if the grass was good , and wherever they passed they left behind them a range ruined for that year . The West has endless stories of battles between established cattlemen and trail tramps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and guns or driven over cliffs ; herders were hanged , shot or chased over the mountains . In retaliation , cattle disappeared or died , and cowboys suffered mayhem . Yet , despite disorders , most cattle and sheep drives were legitimate and necessary . Herds changed hands and ranges . Fat steers and lambs had to go to market . Grass gave out on one range , but was good somewhere else . Railroads were scarce , and until about twenty years ago , nobody dreamed of big-scale highway hauling of livestock . For a while , highway hauling became popular . It seemed the better way . But the war shortage of trucks made driving popular again . Many of the conditions that originally favored drives still prevail , and many believe they will hold their place even when trucks are a dime a dozen again . For it 's a long distance between freight stations in the Magdalena country , and a truck haul can cost plenty . The rail facilities out that way , in fact , would give Connecticut commuters the eight-o'clock shudders . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Santa Fe that follows the Rio Grande through Socorro . It wanders up the hill to Magdalena , thirty miles away and 2000 feet higher . The engine huffs and puffs , but can haul no more than twenty-five cars up the steep grade . There 's one train a day each way . The Magdalena stationmaster , asked for a schedule , snorts , " He the train crew generally leaves here between noon and four . He generally gets here between ten and two . " The line ends at Magdalena , a town of 1300 or so that has been a mining and cattle center so long that it is content to be somnolent and selfunconscious , really waking up only once a year when the cowboys gather from the ranches round about for their strictly amateur rodeo and races . The next rail shipping point is Holbrook , Arizona , 223 miles by highway . In between is " big country , " country you can get lost in , country that has been there a long time and has strange memories . The San Augustine Plains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the Magdalenas , Montosos , Datils , Pelonas , Mogollons , San Materis . Some peaks Ilse to 10,000 feet or more . There are dark canyons and shaly slopes where grizzlies and lions still shelter . The Gila Wilderness area is just over the southern horizon . To the north there 's a vast lava fiowwith cinder cones , ice caves and unexplored mysteries . The driveway proper traverses the San Augustine Plains from end to end . By branches , it draws cattle and sheep from ranches over several thousand square miles . New Mexico Grazing District 2 , as the Grazing Service officially designates the region , includes 4,218,371 acres , of which nearly half is Federal public domain , while the rest is divided between private , state and miscellaneous ownership . There 's a lot of national-forest grazing land adjacent to the district . Any of the ranches , by Eastern measurements , is a little empire . The Reinhardt Brothers , for example , whose cattle are branded S Circle , drive forty miles to town , all on their own range . Crockett @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't the biggest . Hardly any ranch is smaller than ten sections , and one that the owner calls " just a little two-bit cow place " can lose you between the back door and the back fence . It 's in such country that cattle and sheep drives have come back . Conditions that encourage them are significant . This is n't open range any more . It 's fenced . But still they drive . Old-time cattle trails had no fences to worry about . The West was mostly public domain , and still is . But what used to be confused and disorderly has become orderly . Stockmen , through regulations of the Forest Service and the Grazing Service , have gained individual rights in their ranges , though these are by lease rather than ownership . To protect allotted ranges from crowding and trespass , fences have gone up all over the public domain . But  --  and here 's the point  --  reasonably free movement of stock is still as necessary as ever . From the start , the principle of driveways  --  hoof highways  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose . But this proved to be mostly a book transaction . The driveways were n't improved , policed or designed to contribute to the happiness of animals using them . Indeed , the nearest perrnittee usually regarded his section of the driveway as so much extra free range for himself , and he grazed it clean , so that when a flock or herd moved , there was little on the driveway for it to eat . Stockmen used trucks more and more to avoid the losses in weight incurred in driving over grass-less driveways . At first the Magdalena Driveway was no different . It was set aside in 1917 . Improvement did not begin till 1937 . And its importance was not clear until the war . Then , however , it grew into something as different from unimproved driveways as a superhighway is from a back-country dirt road . For one thing , it 's tightly fenced . It can be used only for driving . There 's no free grazing for trespassers . So , when herds move , there 's usually good grass . Blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Frank Hubbell 's big ranch is in the Salt Lake region , more than 100 miles from Magdalena . When his lambs go to market , they 're on the driveway twenty-one days . Last year he shipped the heaviest lambs in the area . One day he assured me that those lambs weighed more at the shipping point , after the long drive , than when they left the ranch . Dick Sellers , whose place is not far from the Mogollons , at the far end of the San Augustine Plains from Magdalena , told me the same thing about his cattle . Fencing to save grass is one thing . Water is another . It is provided at regular intervals . In early-day drives , the drive foreman usually rode ahead to locate water . When it was droughty , cattle sometimes went days between drinks . On the Magdalena Driveway , wells have been put down about every ten miles . Windmills keep huge steel tanks full . Pipes connect them with concrete drinking fountains serving dozens at once . In addition to fences and water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of them strong enough to hold hundreds of mad bulls . If an owner wants to , and nobody beats him to it , he can throw his cattle inside and escape night-herding . Finally , there are definite traffic rules . A stockman must get a permit before going on the driveway ; no charge for that . If he 's driving cattle or horses , they must move not less than ten miles a day ; if sheep , five miles a day . These speeds permit animals to graze as they go , but keep them from eating the driveway clean . Also , the driveway is big enough-64,758 acres , equal to 100 big Illinois farms  --  to allow many herds to travel at once without crowding . This hoof highway , in short , provides about what an automobile tourist expects to find along any good highway  --  a good road , well marked , with plenty of " hotels " and " restaurants " ? and speed limits . Grazing District 2 serves 267 permittees and licensees , and about 110 free users . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less of domestic stock that he is allowed to graze without charge . A few ranchers still find it possible and convenient to move their stock by truck . Most of them , however , drive . Danley figures that 22,756 cattle were driven last winter , and approximately 55,000 sheep . Trucking would have cost about $3.50 per cow and 35 cents per sheep , or a total of nearly $100,000 . October to January is the driveway 's big season . For thirty miles or so , the driveway runs right along with U. S. Highway 60 . This route is not too heavily traveled , but every so often a war worker from Florida or Tennessee , homeward-bound from California , has to stop for ten or fifteen minutes while a thousand lambs without wrist watches and with only one dim idea in mind cross ahead of him . One bunch of Whiteface steers , down from the hills on the trail to town , came to the ribbon of blacktop road for the first time and it scared them worse than a hair rope ever scared a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cowboys in Socorro County could n't make them . They had to be driven back to the ranch . Nearness to the highway makes problems for owners who use pickup trucks for chuck wagons . It 's dangerously easy , in the last stages of a drive , for half the crew to climb aboard at the end of the day , get to Magdalena and back before morning , but be too bleary-eyed at sunup to sit in a saddle . The driveway symbolizes tremendous changes on the range . It penetrates true " story " country . Conquistadors were roaming hereabouts in 52 helmets and breastplates hunting cities of gold before Pilgrims came to Plymouth Rock . Pre-Indian races left ruins on cliffs and mesas , and a cowboy may find pictographs on rock faces any day . Mines abound . There are endless treasure tales . The owners of one ranch are always on the lookout for two wagonloads of pure silver stolen from the famous Lake Valley mine and never recovered , though the thieves were shot . Some old-timers think they know about where the fabulous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kettle can be gathered in no time . Apaches roamed and killed here not long ago , and the San Augustine Plains saw the beginning of more than one of those great sheep drives , each a minor epic , bound from the feeding grounds of New Mexico for the hungry mining camps of California . The coming of cattle and unpredictable cattlemen created stories of a new kind . They still talk a lot about the fabulous Ray Morley , for example , the bearded cattleman and ex-football coach , who once controlled nearly half a million acres , and who is said to have dyed a bunch of sheep so a gullible Easterner could keep raising the kind of colored wool the Navajos wanted for their rugs ; and who allegedly once lent his car to cattle buyers , then Phoned the sheriff it was stolen , causing the cattle buyers to lie in jail three days before he rescued them . True or false , such stories grew . Another story character was the Englishman , Montague Stevens , who lost an arm , but always rode harder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote a fascinating account of dogs and hunting in his book , Meet Mr. Grizzly . New times , new ways . Ray Morley 's sister , Agnes Morley Cleaveland , still lives close to where their mother unloaded the family from a covered wagon nearly sixty years ago . In her popular autobiography , No Life for a Lady , she recorded scores of incidents and memories . Not long ago , she told me , she was piloting some visiting friends to the Cebolleta Indian ruin , in the direction of Poverty Pool Flat , and she thought it would be fun to meet a trail herd and let the novices eat at the chuck wagon ; and sure enough , as they rounded a point , there was a trail herd spread out in an open draw . She hailed the boss . He was an old friend , Johnny ( Bowlegs ) Payne . " Just in time for chuck , " she said , expectantly . It was a matter of high pride on the range to invite the stranger to " light and have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossed Bowlegs ' face . ? ? 16 " Never thought it would come to this , Mis ' Agnes , " he said . " We ai n't got no chuck wagon . " He waved toward where the rest of the crew was eating under a big pine tree . Instead of a cooking rack , Dutch ovens and coffeepot , there were vacuum jugs , lunch hoxes and pop bottles . " We send the pickup forty miles to Gallup for Fred Harvey lunches , " Bowlegs said . " The new boss says it 's cheaper . Maybe ' t is . I 've already done et my own lettuce sandwich an ' pickle , an ' there ai n't an extry in camp . " Yes , there truly are changes . But the biggest is the fact that order under regulation is preferred to the old way of get-what-you-can-hold and shoot-ifyou-must . The authority of the Government is accepted now , simply because stockmen know it 's the sensible way to do the job . A year ago a sheep-man was allowing his flocks to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after warnings , he was " trespassed " and given a fairly stiff fine and a warning that a fourth offense would cost him his grazing rights . The lesson went home . Last winter his lambs were on the driveway and got to Magdalena before the cars came to haul them away . Instead of holding the lambs on the driveway for three or four days , as he might legally have done , he rented private pasture : he was n't going to run any risk of being called a trespasser and losing that precious permit . I listened to another sheepman explain almost tearfully to Danley that be was n't trying to mooch driveway grass . He had a permit , he explained , to move 2000 sheep to a distant range . Halfway there , they ran into a heavy growth of chamiza . This valuable forage plant was new to his sheep , and they sure loved it . But the sheep and the rains hit the chamiza at the same time , and the sheep , overgreedy , bloated . Some died . Knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his herders turn back . Then he met Dan-ley . The significant thing was his earnest effort to prove his absolute honesty . In the old days he might have felt accountable to nobody . That 's change . Few cow camps actually depend on Harvey lunch boxes and sandwiches with lettuce panties . Most stockmen eat big and live lustily , as always . The country is almost as wild as ever . Distances are the same . Cattle and sheep are about the same . The change is in attitude . Things once accomplished outside the law are now done better under regulation . The driveway is a striking symbol of change that has removed many of the old reasons for conflict and insecurity . On the whole , the West likes the new way better .
