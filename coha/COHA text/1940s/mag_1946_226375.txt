The Women <P> John O'Hara , satirical best-seller whose expert fictions ( Appointment in Samarra , Pipe Night ) occasionally burn women with a hard , acetylene-like flame , explained why women fascinate him as a writer : " You never can tell what they will do . " On the other hand , said he : " The whole tradition of masculinity , at least in America , is to stay in the groove-and that means stay in the rut-do n't stick your neck out . " <P> Ellen Wilkinson , Britain 's Minister of Education , appeared in the House of Commons sporting a hat to remember : high-masted , forward-pitched , bobbing with green feathers at the prow . Small , bird-like Minister Wilkinson , fiftyish , got up to answer a question about textbooks . M.P.s , fascinated by the hat , lost a gentlemanly struggle with laughter . Minister Wilkinson giggled too . " It looks all right , Ellen , " said House Leader Herbert Morrison encouragingly . A faint cheer arose . Minister Wilkinson sailed bravely ahead . <P> Road to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 29-year-old second cousin of the Duke of Windsor , happily prepared to renounce his rights to the Swedish throne . In topcoat and homburg , and clutching violets , he sped down to a Manhattan dock to greet slim , trim Mrs. Kerstin Wijkmark , 35-year-old divorced Swedish journalist . <P> Down the gangplank she came in mink and a yellow headscarf , sped to his arms , marked him with lipstick , then gaily wiped it off and bussed him again a couple of times for the news photographers . They had always wanted to live here , and now they would . The prince had a job , with an export-import firm . He had even bagged an apartment-three rooms . Porters piled 37 pieces of luggage into a cab , and off they rattled-the energetic bride-to-be and the future Mr. Carl J. Bernadotte. * <P> Sporting Life <P> James Joseph Tunney , on vacation in Havana , worked out on his hotel roof , drew news photographers , who found him looking exactly like a 48-year-old retired heavyweight-still in topnotch shape , here &; there . <P> Vice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could get no work shirts in which to do his new job as Ambassador to Belgium . He wildly rummaged Washington , D.C. for twelve , white , boiled . Size : 15 , 34-in-sleeve . <P> Francisco Franco lightened the gloom of a generally hostile world by togging himself in hunting clothes and giving a splendid imitation of an old-fashioned candidate for some office or other . <P> New Directions Congresswoman Clare Boothe Luce 's " good and sufficient reason " for deciding not to run for re-election in Connecticut suddenly became clear : she was received into the Roman Catholic Church , at St. Patrick 's Cathedral in Manhattan , and promptly explained matters . The " question of faith " might be raised if she now ran for office , said she ; such a " false issue " might obscure important political issues ; so she was " unavailable by design or draft .
