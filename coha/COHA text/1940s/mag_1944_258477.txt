At exactly 4 p.m. the big brown C-54 touched the ground of the Washington airport . The door swung open ; out stepped Charles Andr Joseph Marie de Gaulle . <P> The General looked down on a platoon of French air cadets and three squadrons of U.S. airmen , rigid at attention while the 94 heat wilted their khaki and soaked their hats . He stood there for a long moment , looking about him , blinking under the sun of a land he had never seen before . Then slowly Charles de Gaulle moved down the ramp , looking even taller than his 6 ft. 4 in. , even thinner than his pictures . As his foot touched the ground , the 17-gun salute to a general roared into the hazy heat ( four guns less than the salute for the head of a state ) . The faint est smile passed across the grey , impassive face of Charles de Gaulle . <P> Comment a va ? While the smoke from the guns curled up into the haze , Henri Hoppenot , De Gaulle 's representative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Department 's Protocol Chief George T. Summerlin . The three men walked over to a little group of top French and U.S. military men . " Very glad , " said De Gaulle , in his rehearsed English , stiffly shaking General Marshall 's hand . He passed on to General Arnold , Admiral King , and Lieut . <P> General Vandegrift ( of the Marines ) , to Major General Watson and Vice Admiral Brown , White House aides . A U.S. Air Forces band blared the Marseillaise and the Star Spangled Banner ( an honor re served for heads of states , members of reigning royal families , and diplomats of ambassadorial rank , according to strict protocol ) . General de Gaulle 's body clicked into ramrod attention , two stars gleaming just above the cuff-line of his saluting arm . <P> A sleek black Cadillac whisked the General to the White House . In the oval , creamy-walled old diplomatic reception room , Franklin Roosevelt said , " My , I 'm glad to see you . " The conversation limped along in mangled French and English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the photographers were through and Franklin Roosevelt said . <P> " Let 's go upstairs and have some tea . " <P> Visitor 's Grind . That night General de Gaulle was given a dinner by Secretary of State Cordell Hull in the Carlton Hotel . <P> The General was miserably tired , his eyes ringed with deep black . But he drank heartily of Manhattans , French sauterne , American Burgundy and Portuguese champagne , and cleaned up his squab and asparagus tips . At 10:42 he was out in the lobby again . Many distinguished people have walked through the Carlton lobby , but never before had the well-dressed loungers bothered to stand up and applaud . <P> The General merely looked around at them briefly , mildly gestured his hand , kept right on walking . The applauders plainly regretted their lapse from indifference . <P> Next morning his minute-to-minute schedule ground on . At the sumptuous residence of Henri Hoppenot , at 2929 Massachusetts Ave. , De Gaulle met the people who were carrying on the work of his Committee in the U.S. Still poker-faced , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once again . . . . Let the past be past . . . . <P> Before the end of 1944 every German now in France will be killed , made prisoner or obliged to flee . It is up to ourselves to shape our future . . . .
