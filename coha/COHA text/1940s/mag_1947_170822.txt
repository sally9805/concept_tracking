The Chinese say that their painting is " like vapors and clouds which rise into space , gather around cliffs and drift over wide expanses . ... " <P> Westerners often have trouble catching the drift of these painted vapors . One who has no trouble is Princeton 's George Rowley . His Principles of Chinese Painting ( Princeton University Press ; $15 ) , on sale last week , is a well-illustrated and well-reasoned study of this elusive cloudland . Summarizing the Chinese approach to painting , Author Rowley lists four " categories of greatness " : <P> Chiao ( clever ) . " Clever " Chinese are slick at rendering the " outward formal likeness " ; they know the " rules . " As Old Master Ching Hao put it : " The skillful painter carves out and pieces together scraps of beauty . " <P> Miao ( wonderful ) . " Wonderful " painters have no idea what makes them so . Their work is moving but it is apt to look " strange , queer , and have neither reason nor resemblance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not thought ( ss ) . " <P> Shn ( divine ) . The " divine " painter penetrates " with his thoughts the nature of everything in heaven and earth , and thus things flow out of his brush in accordance with the truth of the motif . " No artist can be " divine " who is not something of a mystic . Some Chinese **28;16056;TOOLONG the " divine " is as much as any artist can hope to achieve . <P> I ( effortlessness ) . " This kind of excellence can only be found in the seers , the saints , and the greatest artists . . . . Perhaps untrammeled is the one word which comes closest to suggesting this ultimate quality . ... If the painter has attained depth and breadth of character , then he is ready to aspire to that highest kind of freedom , the freedom of effortless creation . "
