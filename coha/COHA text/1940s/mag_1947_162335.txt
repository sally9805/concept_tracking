It was a big week for Gillette . First , the razor blade company launched a $1,000,000 campaign to plug its new bright blue plastic container for 20 blades ( 98 ) . Next day , the board of directors declared an extra dividend of 50 a share , raising 1947 dividends to $2.87 a share , highest in the company 's history . The following day , Gillette 's 3,457 employees got an extra week 's pay as a bonus for record production . <P> That evening , company foremen were guests at a champagne-confetti blowout at Boston 's Copley-Plaza Hotel , heard a short pep talk : " You 've done a damn good job , guys , " said President Joseph P. Spang Jr. , " but in the same breath I want to say we 're still behind on our orders . We want to get that old man 's face in every store in the world . " <P> Blades for Bottle Caps . The old man , the late King C. Gillette , whose mustachioed countenance is one of the company 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one day in 1895 , he tried to think of some invention as indispensable , disposable , and cheap as a bottle cap . Result : the first idea for a safety razor with a throw-away blade . <P> It was 1904 before he got enough money and machinery to put the safety into production . Since then the company has never lost any money , never failed to pay a dividend . But competition and the depression of the ' 30s sent the directors on a man hunt for someone to better the company 's " disappointing " results . Spang was chosen . <P> A Bostonian and a graduate of Harvard , where he made freshman letters in football , and track , Joe Spang , now 54 , got his start shaving hogs for Swift &; Co . He was Swift 's vice president in charge of sales when Gillette hired him away in 1938 at $45,000 a year ( present salary : $100,000 ) . <P> Blades for Strawberries . Gillette 's new President Spang was a real salesman , all right . Under Spang , Gillette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was thus able to talk ( " Look Sharp ! Feel Sharp ! Be Sharp ! " ) to a shaving audience . Spang dropped the company 's electric shaver because it competed with the more profitable blade business , added shaving cream to the line of products , followed up advertising with hard-hitting merchandising . Gillette 's net income increased from $2,941,890 in 1938 to $10,501,448 last year . This year the company 's main plant in South Boston is still working the wartime three shifts a day . <P> Gillette 's seven foreign plants ( Berlin , London , Buenos Aires , Paris , Zurich , Montreal and Rio de Janeiro ) are also working at capacity . In foreign trade , Spang had gotten around the lack of dollars and other currency troubles by a system of " compensation trading . " Thus , Swiss-made blades are being exchanged in Italy for tomatoes , asparagus , and strawberries , in Austria for wood , in Czechoslovakia for glass . The goods are then sold in Switzerland for francs and the francs exchanged for U.S. dollars to buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So what if we ca n't get our profits out , ' ' says Spang , an enthusiastic foreign trader . " We 'll get them eventually . We 're not in business for five years or just ten years or even 50 years . We 're in business from now on-indefinitely. "
