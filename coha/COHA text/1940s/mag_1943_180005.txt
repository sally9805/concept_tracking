" War is grim and war is horrible . It has always been the military man himself who has been the first to point this out , wisely leaving it to well-manicured civilians to sing sweetly of its lice and mud and torture and death . . . . This present tragedy of history is markedly different from its predecessors . In this war the artist is on the spot . Whatever his previous preoccupation with three plums in a silver dish or three girls in a grassy glade , the artist has now been wrenched out of it by the necessity of recording . . . man 's reaction to the greatest crisis of all history . . . .

The 125 paintings , later to tour the country , were part of a large-scale venture unique in unofficial war recording : since before Pearl Harbor , LIFE has been sending artists-all easel painters of standing-to camps , to war fronts and to sea as accredited war correspondents . Their pictures will eventually be given to the Government , to be housed in some future museum of war art . <P> In Washington , varnishing-day guests saw oils , water colors and some drawings of subjects from a pre-Pearl Harbor defense plant ( by Paul Sample ) to Texas Artist Torn Lea 's literal impressions during the Battle of the Solomons . Notable were a richly colored night scene by Chicagoan Aaron Bohrod of soldiers from Fort Benning , Ga . disporting themselves at an amusement park , and Peter Kurd 's painting of B-17s returning at twilight from a raid on Rouen .
