In seven days last week the U.S. and British air forces operating from Britain dropped between 16,000 and 17,000 tons of bombs on Nazi Europe . <P> About 900 freight cars would be required to transport this tonnage by rail . It compares with 13,000 tons dropped by the R.A.F. in the 52 weeks of 1940 , with 7,500 tons dropped by the Germans in the entire London blitz . <P> Such bombing has not taken place in previous years because the air fleets required to deliver it were not in existence . But even three months ago such a tonnage could not have been dropped in one week . For three months ago the Luftwaffe was fighting every raid with all it had-many bombers were shot down , and many so shot up that they required extensive repairs . Again &; again the R.A.F. and Eighth Air Force had to take several days off to lick their wounds-and they can not take much time out if they are to deliver 16,000 tons of bombs a week . <P> The German Choice . In short , since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not that the German air force has been destroyed . It is not that German plane production has been wiped out . What has happened is that the German air force does not choose to fight except occasionally . <P> This is a deliberate German choice , but it is a choice made from weakness . It is similar to the German choice not to press the U-boat war . The Germans still have many U-boats . Some day , perhaps when the second front is launched , they will be thrown in as a wolf pack , exceeding in size any that has ever struck before . But the undersea war has become so tough for the Germans that they have had to limit operations sharply in order to preserve their U-boat fleet . <P> In the same way the Luftwaffe has chosen to curtail its operations-because its losses were too heavy and damage to German plane factories had reduced its rate of replacement . <P> Allied airmen found the Luftwaffe last week choosing its spots-holding back on some days ( often in cloudy weather ) , fighting savagely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fleet of 600 Fortresses and Liberators bombed Berlin at leisure , while their fighter escorts scoured the air around the city and found not a single Nazi pilot to quarrel with . <P> But next day was . different . A similar U.S. air fleet attacked Brunswick , Mn-ster and four smaller towns , and this time the Luftwaffe came up in force and fought . Toll for the attackers was 27 bombers and six fighters , but 61 Nazi planes were shot down . And at week 's end a fleet of more than 1,000 R.A.F. bombers fought a grueling battle with flak and night-fighters over Berlin , paying with 73 bombers for the huge fires left spreading in the doomed Nazi capital . <P> Top Priority . Allied airmen are convinced that the Luftwaffe is now giving its No. 1 priority to preserving " an air force in being " for use against Allied invasion of the Continent . No. 2 priority is defense of vital industries , with such issues as home morale and the Russian and Italian fronts well down the list . <P> Like a badly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shortened its line by retreating-first by virtually surrendering the air over France , again by refusing daylight combat on days of poor weather and overcast .
