Last week the U. S. felt suddenly defenseless . The hurricane that had struck Europe , the gathering clouds in the Three Easts , had come , with nightmare speed , close , real and threatening . The reaction was profound - broad and deep . As in few times of peace the Nation spoke as a whole and the voice came clear to Congress : Arm . Arm the U. S. for what may come . <P> There were cool heads . Deeper than the widely reported hysteria was a grim determination to prepare for anything . One tremendous shift was apparent : the rising wind of world events had for a time at least blown away Isolationism . There were still Isolationists in the U. S. but they were themselves isolated from the feeling of the nation as a whole if not from reality . <P> To many a U. S. citizen , the screaming headlines of the German smash through Belgium and down into France came like an unremitting , seven-day Orson Welles broadcast of an invasion from Mars . <P> In Jeannette , Pa. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ descending from the skies ; the Pennsylvania legislature studied ways to protect industrial plants from air raids ; in Brooklyn a war-crazed British sailor danced despairingly on a high window ledge ; in Manhattan and Seattle , two men killed themselves because of news ; in Kirkland , Wash . a lady letter-writer noted approvingly that a coffee shop had changed " hamburger " on the menu to " liberty steak . " <P> Columnist Westbrook Pegler led his column : " Now , just a minute . Wait a minute ! " New York City 's waddly Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia griped that the U.

S. out of war ; Temple University 's student chiefs telegraphed a plea to calm " war hysteria " ; Harvard Professor Roger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the moral issue " ; Stanford students wired Mr. Roosevelt protests at his Pan-American policies ; in Manhattan Author Hendrik Willem Van Loon resigned from the Dutch Treat Club because Author Clarence Budington Kelland remarked : " The fifth column in this country is headed by that fellow in the White House . " <P> ? The New York Herald Tribune 's Editorial Writer Walter Millis , author of the Isolationists ' Bible , Road to War , wrote in his Yale 20th reunion book : " I would like to see the Nazis get the pants licked off them and the Stalinists sent back to the Kremlin ... I hope the U. S. wo n't have to get into the war , but am not prepared to say that under certain circumstances American military participation would not be necessary and worth it . " ? In the House , Ism-eater Martin Dies was lustily applauded for the first time in months when he launched a routine denunciation of isms and the C. I. O. ?
