For two years Russia has stalled U.S. efforts to plan jointly the freedom of a united Korea . But in her zone north of the 38th parallel , Russia has quietly built up a one-party , Communist-led government , trained and armed a big native Korean army ( more than 100,000 men ) .

Instead , the Russians have spent most of their time organizing South Korean Communists , and setting up an elaborate espionage system headed by Anatole Ivanovich Shabshin , who was Russian vice consul in Seoul for eight years before the war . U.S. experts wondered when the Russians would feel that their North Korean puppets were strong enough to engulf South Korea without open Soviet help . <P> Last week the Russians apparently felt that the moment was near . Colonel General Terenty F. Shtykov , chief Russian delegate to the Joint Commission , said that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1948 , " then the Soviet troops will be ready to leave Korea simultaneously . " Translated from the Russian , this was another way of saying : Let us both leave the lamb to the butcher . Cried Moderate Leader Kim Kyh Sik , chairman of the Korean Interim Legislative Assembly : if the U.S. withdrew , " North Koreans would sweep down like red lava , cover South Korea and end Korea 's existence . " The U.S. Government , which last fortnight asked the U.N . General Assembly to help end the Korean stalemate , thought the same .
