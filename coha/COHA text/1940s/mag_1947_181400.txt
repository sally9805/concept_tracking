The atomic dragon 's trainers are learning how to gentle him . They have a long way to go . The dragon is still too fractious to harness ; his fiery breath is still deadly . But last week the trainers announced important progress ; atomic energy may yet do more good than harm . Some day the dragon may be yoked to a plowshare . <P> At Los Alamos , N.Mex. , the atomic Forbidden City , the physicists described a gentle atom bomb . It contains enough " fissionable material " to vaporize its surroundings . But instead of exploding , it smolders as quietly as a furnace banked for the night . <P> Hazardous Past . The tight-lipped Atomic Energy Commission did not tell all it knows about the new " reactor . " The active substance is plutonium , which wrecked Nagasaki . This time it is under exact control . In operation since last November , the tame bomb can be throttled down until " the heat produced in the core of the reactor is no greater than that given off by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a " pile " like the original uranium pile at the University of Chicago . But uranium needs slow-moving neutrons to make its atoms split . Thus , a uranium pile is made up of small rods of uranium embedded in a large mass of graphite . Plutonium is different : its atoms can be split by fast neutrons . So a pile made of plutonium needs no graphite or other " moderator . " The " Nagasaki model " atom bomb is a plutonium pile that reacts so quickly that it blows itself ( and the neighborhood ) to bits in millionths of a second . <P> The bomb-tamers of Los Alamos had a ticklish assignment : to make their bomb explode , but gently , in slow motion . How they solved the problem has not been fully explained . Uranium piles are kept from reacting too fast by inserting cadmium rods into the graphite . The rods absorb neutrons and check the action . The more cadmium , the slower the pile percolates . Some similar method may be controlling the tame plutonium . <P> The A.E.C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bomb taming : " Original design , testing and construction were undertaken by a group working with the late Dr. Louis Slotin , victim of a radiation accident at the Los Alamos Laboratory in May , 1946 . . . . " <P> Hopeful Future . " The heart of the fast reactor , " the report explains , " is a small vessel " ; but apparently the vessel must be surrounded by a good deal of auxiliary apparatus . " Since the heat is generated in a relatively small region , special cooling provisions are required to prevent overheating of the center of the reactor . " <P> So far , the plutonium pile has been used only for research , where it has been extremely useful : " The fast reactor gives a more intense source of fast neutrons than physicists heretofore have been able to obtain , except during the brief time of the test of the first atomic bomb in the New Mexico desert . " <P> Keeping its secrets close to its chest , the A.E.G. hardly mentioned the practical possibilities . The fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thick shield to protect the neighborhood from destructive radiation . This limits its use . But the comparatively small size is an obvious advantage . The new pile , further developed and allowed to run faster and hotter , may be the furnace of tomorrow 's atomic power plant .
