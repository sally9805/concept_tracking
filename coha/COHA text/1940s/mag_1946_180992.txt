The Cleveland Indians bloom in the spring , and look pretty on paper , but in 45 years they have won the pennant only once . Every summer Cleveland fans rise up and holler for an Indian 's scalp-usually the manager 's . This time they wanted to fire the owners . <P> The situation looked promising to a minor-league mogul and ex-marine named Bill Veeck ( rhymes with wreck ) . He rounded up nine moneymen , including Comedian Bob Hope . Last week they bought the Indians for about $1,750,000 . <P> The first thing Boss Veeck did was to count the customers . The 8,526 who went to see the Indians beat the league-leading Red Sox were a pretty small band . But there were only 22 people in the stands the day Veeck bought the bankrupt Milwaukee Brewers in 1941 . Veeck soon put his theory to work in Milwaukee : good baseball for the fans , something extra for those who are n't . <P> Boogie Woogie &; Bases . The extras included boogie-woogie bands and tightrope walkers . He put on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a.m. ) for night workers in war plants , and gave away sway-back nags and pigeons ( without cages ) as door prizes . <P> Ballplayers came in &; out of Milwaukee so fast that Veeck liked to say he had three teams-the one that left yesterday , the one playing today , the one coming in tomorrow . After lifting Milwaukee from eighth to first place in the American Association in two years ( and the value of the club from $90,000 to $250,000 ) , Veeck joined the Marines . An impish-looking fellow of 33 with a crew haircut and massive face , he was injured at Bougainville , now carries his right leg in a cast . <P> He won Cleveland sportswriters instantly by confessing : " I 'm a publicity hound . " They were pushovers anyway for someone who promised to do something about the Indians .
