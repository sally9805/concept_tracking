Ambassador Winant stepped out of the White House last week as gingerly as a man who feels he is loaded with dynamite and may blow up if anybody bumps into him . He had reason to step warily . Before he left England , the British Government had shown him a confidence that few Ambassadors have received . It turned over to Gil Winant an account of British war plans and British war experiences , as well as analyses of Britain 's shortcomings , tragic mistakes , and lessons learned , at a frightful cost , during the war . <P> Obviously Ambassador Winant could not talk freely , even to himself . His voice , ordinarily very low , almost died away entirely . Prolonging the agony was the fact that President Roosevelt , resting after his speech , had kept him waiting for four days . When Ambassador Winant , having reported to his chief , eventually emerged from the White House last week , he apologized to reporters , in his slow , pained voice : " It 's easy to understand that there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make public statements which might endanger their fighting forces . " <P> Then Ambassador Winant hurried on to meetings and interviews-with Secretary Hull , Harry Hopkins , Secretaries Stimson and Knox , many others-until 2 every morning . <P> Partly because the U.S. public does not know John Gilbert Winant very well , extravagant stories about his mission nourished . A shy , sincere man who usually gives the impression of being much more ill at ease than he actually is , he is an effective Ambassador because he has a quality more valuable than any amount of diplomatic training-an imaginative sympathy for the suffering of people with whom he lives . <P> As Ambassador Winant made his rounds in Washington , the stories about him multiplied . Irritated particularly by one-that the Ambassador had brought word of a peace offer which Britain was considering - President Roosevelt held one of his hottest press conferences in eight years . Glaring sternly at the reporters , the President said he had on his desk copies of two orders sent from Germany to Nazi dupes and Nazi agents in the U.S. One order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ever moving against a country in the Western Hemisphere ( and the President mentioned Adolf Hitler 's remarks to ex-Ambassador John Cudahy-last week published in LIFE-as one example ) . The other order was to spread the story , as soon as Mr. Winant arrived in the U.S. , that Britain was all in and ready to sue for peace . <P> " There was not even a tenth cousin of a peace offer or anything like that , " said the President , letting correspondents quote him directly ( " provided you use this , not as a denial by the President , but as an accusation by the President " ) . <P> Whatever the Ambassador had brought back , it was not peace talk . The U.S. could no more learn the details of Ambassador Winant 's report than it could learn the plans of the British General Staff , but it could learn the general outline of his views .
