txt ATTACK UP THAMES Germans Press Steady Drive From Southeast at British Capital BIG FORMATIONS BROKEN R. A. F. Fighters Scatter Foe Over Kent  --  Bombs Hit Widespread Areas By ROBERT P. POST Special Cable to THE NEW YORK Tuses . LONDON , Tuesday , Sept. 3 ? What is coming to be the familiar pattern of German air raids over England was repeated yesterday and during the night . Large formations of Nazi planes came over the southeast coast and over Kent . They were met by fierce resistance , as the alarm sirens wailed in London ; the formations were broken by Britain 's fighter aircraft and anti-aircraft guns , and the raiders retired , leaving losses . Indicating a change in tactics the British did not throw in their Spitfire and Hurricane fighters until after the raiders , which came over in waves of 100 or more , had met anti-aircraft barrages . Then the fighters dived in against the German formations , already confused by the reception they had got from the ground , and scattered most of them in the Kentish region . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P. M. The high , mellow note of " All clear " from this alarm sounded over the capital just before 3 o'clock this morning . Flashes Seen From City Roof Nothing could be seen from a high roof in the city except distant searchlight beams and occasional flashes that might be bombs and anti-aircraft fire ; or might , on the other hand , be from street cars &ling; about their businesses . Up to 10 P. M. , the Air Ministry said , the day 's figure for the German planes shot down was fortytwo  --  thirty-eight by fighters of the Royal Air Force and four by antiaircraft guns . Thirteen British fighters were lost , with the pilots of seven of them saved , according to the Air Ministry . The Ministry announced a revised " score " for Saturday that brought the total of Nazi planes known to have been brought down that day to eighty-eight . Yesterday 's first two London warnings , at least , were caused by raiders apparently coming in over the Thames Estuary . They met intense anti-aircraft fire that is reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time of the first siren alarm a large number of Nazi aircraft had been forcing their way up the Estuary . They flew into a terrific fire from ring after ring of London 's defense guns . R. A. F. fighters soon joined the game . Battle Fought Swiftly As a matter of fact it was not until after the Germans had turned tail that the sirens in the center of the city went off , so fast was this particular air skirmish . Nevertheless , the German formation was so ' broken up , with Nazi fliers in many parts of the area , that it was not until forty-three minutes after the alarm that " All clear " was sounded . Thereafter all was quiet within London until 5:24 P. M. , when the " Devil 's Chord " again set up its wail . The reason was the same . A group of Nazi raiders  --  this time estimated at about 100 ? flying toward London again met such a battering from anti-aircraft guns that the formations broke as the avenging wave of British fighters poured in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before 6 P. M. A Southeast Coast town suffered the worst in a raid late during the night . Many high explosive and incendiary bombs fell over a huge section of the community . The Midlands were bombed for the eleventh successive night . A man and a baby were killed when a shelter in one town took a direct hit . Several houses in the town were damaged and heavy explosions were heard elsewhere . Some of the German planes that crossed the southeast coast were said by observers to be four-engined craft , Junkers 89 's , of the type the Nazis have used as troop-carrying machine 's in the war on the Continent . But there was said to be no evidence they were being used as such here . Against all of the day 's raids the // NAZI PLANES RAID BRITAIN IN RYES // British fighters took a heavy toll . In the Germans ' widespread attacks , both high explosive and incendiary bombs were dropped in many parts of Britain . The astounding thing in the whole situation of England is that ordinary life for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is being lived without anything but the adjustments  --  so pathetically easy ? that have to be made when death flies nightly overhead . Raids All Over England . LONDON , Tuesday , Sept. 3 ( R ) ? Throughout the waves of air attacks yesterday and during the night , comparatively little activity was seen or heard in London itself , but the German planes fanned out in raids over all of England . It was estimated the Nazis hurled about 700 planes against Britain in three attempts during yesterday to bring destruction upon London . An Air Ministry bulletin said 300 bombers and fighters were used In the last daylight attack . While the number of night raiders was not known , it was reported they were coming over singly or in small groups . One Nazi dropped about fifteen bombs . Another loosed two scream bombs on the gardens of a residential district of London , damaging houses but causing no casualties . In addition to the night thrust at London  --  a little later than the timetable schedule of the past few nights  --  the Germans were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , southwest , northwest and Northeast England and the Midlands and over Wales . The night alarm- started " silently , " both sides sparring for openings . Six waves of German bombers escorted by fighter planes crossed the Southeast coast during the afternoon and evening , but British fighter planes broke up the formations  --  each of about sixty planes ? and forced them back . The British fighters darted out of blinding sun and battered and smashed the close-packed " Luftwaffe " waves that included huge , four-motored Junkers bombers . Bombs were dropped in the metropolitan area , but bitter anti-aircraft fire kept the Nazis from the heart of London , shooting down three Nazi bombers within two minutes over the outskirts of the city late in the day when 100 German planes attacked . The Germans flew over the coastline at great height and in close formation , but anti-aircraft fire forced them to scatter . Then the fighter planes roared to the attack " like a pack of dogs , " and the Germans never reached the ' city proper .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
