No South American scientist had ever been awarded such honors in the U.S. In Manhattan last week , Argentina 's Dr. Bernardo Alberto Houssay was made an honorary fellow of the New York Academy of Medicine . In Boca Raton , Fla. , the American Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association gave him its first award for distinguished research . Eminent U.S. scientists acclaimed the shy Argentine " the world 's greatest living physiologist . " <P> The object of all this kudos was a small , quiet , black-eyed , 60-year-old man stiffly dressed in a black sack coat and old-fashioned starched collar . Because he signed a wartime manifesto favoring " democracy and American solidarity , " he was promptly fired from his job at the University of Buenos Aires by Argentina 's Dictator Juan Peron . <P> A great admirer of the U.S. , which he considers the " most scientific " and one of the " most moral " nations in the world , Dr. Houssay last week was traveling happily from banquet to banquet and reveling in the " international fraternity " of his fellow scientists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is very regrettable that political considerations oblige us to some restriction . " <P> Dr. Houssay 's most important work has been on the pituitary gland . ( He discovered that pituitary secretions play a part in diabetes . ) But he and his colleagues have also published nearly 300 reports on a wide range of medical studies . His monumental Human Physiology , considered by some the finest physiology text ever written , will soon be published in English by McGraw-Hill for worldwide distribution - the first Latin American scientific work to be given such recognition . Dr. Houssay has been honored by scientists and leaders of a dozen nations ( including the British Royal Society ) . But in Argentina he is now restricted to a small laboratory financed partly by the Rockefeller Foundation . <P> Said shaggy Dr. Anton J. Carlson , dean of U.S. physiologists , as he presented the research award to Dr. Houssay in Boca Raton : " We regret that a few myopic citizens in our sister Republic of Argentina have tried to black out the Houssay scientific beacon at Buenos Aires . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frontiers of biology and medicine in every land . "
