The U.S. prepared to mobilize for total war . This meant manpower-and woman-power ; every man , woman , youth and maid , of every race , color and creed who is not lame or halt or blind . The move was one of potentially vast scope : it meant , if carried all the way through , a shake-up of U.S. life so deep , so wide , so far-reaching it could not yet be grasped . It might take another year or more of total war to bring the earthquake shock full home . <P> To start the great job , the President created a War Manpower Commission . He named as boss the man who had drawn up the first tentative plan : Federal Security Administrator Paul Vories McNutt . And to Manpowerman McNutt he gave an executive order that was a basic blueprint for regimentation-if the demands of total war required regimentation . The 132,000,000 U.S. citizens , unsure and shaken , prayed that Mr. McNutt would use his great power wisely . <P> Manpower , the nation 's greatest asset , was being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the draft , by unregulated enlistments of men who were more useful in their jobs than in the services , by industrial competition for skilled and able managers . The order would stop all that-as fast as McNutt could act . <P> For months , ideas and plans for such a manpower mobilization had floated across the White House desk , to sink out of sight in the President 's " dead basket . " The clear-cut necessity for such a mobilization had been sidetracked by the usual scramble of power politics-and by the President 's reluctance to set in motion such an upheaval . Then a fortnight ago four White House advisers ( Supreme Court Justice William 0 . Douglas , Budget Director Harold Smith , and Brain-Trusters Judge Samuel I. Rosenman and Anna Rosenberg ) met in secret sessions , emerged with a final plan . Last week the President moved , named as chairman the man who had always hankered after the job . WPB 's Sidney Hillman , who had also wanted the job , was shunted into a corner as " special assistant to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organized labor had once opposed on account of his past labor record , in the past two years had carefully made his peace in that quarter . Now the sun rose in glory upon politically ambitious Mr. McNutt . While the full scope of his authority was not entirely clear , men who expertly analyze White House orders were sure that snow-crested Paul McNutt , who had rejected a sure Vice Presidential nomination in Chicago in 1940 because Franklin Roosevelt wanted Henry A. Wallace , had received a compound-interest reward . <P> His War Manpower Commission was to be a nine-man board , to include the Secretaries of War , Navy , Agriculture &; Labor , WPB Chairman Nelson , representatives of the labor-production division of WPB , the Selective Service system , the Civil Service Commission . In all matters of manpower these mighty ones were directed to defer to Chairman McNutt.
