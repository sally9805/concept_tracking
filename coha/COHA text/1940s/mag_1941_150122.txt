Brahms : Concerto No. 2 in B Flat Major ( Vladimir Horowitz , pianist , with the NBC Symphony under Arturo Toscanini ; Victor : 12 sides ; $6.50 ) . The Brahms concertos are as massively splendiferous as the Brahms symphonies . In this one , Toscanini , his pianist son-in-law and the recording engineers ( it was made in Carnegie Hall instead of in NBC 's woolly-sounding Studio 8-H ) do a superb job . <P> Tchaikovsky : Symphony No. 3 in D Major ( " Polish " ) ( National Symphony Orchestra , conducted by Hans Kindler ; Victor : 10 sides ; $5.50 ) . A melodious , unaccountably little-played work , whose title " Polish " has almost no relevance , gets a fine performance by Washington 's able young orchestra . <P> Patter Songs from Gilbert &; Sullivan ( Nelson Eddy , baritone , with chorus and orchestra conducted by Robert Armbruster ; Columbia : 6 sides ; $2.75 ) . Baritone Eddy 's fans-but not Savoyards-will forgive his rather apologetic , Yankeefied impersonations of the Mikado , Jack Point , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , First Lord of the Admiralty Sir Joseph Porter , K.C.B. The last one sounds like an odd , unconscious parody of President Roosevelt speechmaking . <P> Aaron Copland ; Music for the Theatre ( Eastman-Rochester Symphony Orchestra . Howard Hanson conducting ; Victor : 6 sides ; $3.50 ) . First performance of one of the best of contemporary scores : a set of sharp , finely orchestrated pieces for no particular play . <P> Selections from Six Wagnerian Operas ( Lauritz Melchior , tenor , with the Philadelphia Orchestra conducted by Eugene Ormandy , the Victor Symphony and the San Francisco Opera Orchestra conducted by Edwin McArthur ; Victor : 10 sides ; $5.50 ) . In fine fettle , so well in the groove that you can almost see him bounding Wagneriously , Tenor Melchior gives voice to airs from Lohengrin , Tannhauser , Die Meistersinger , Flying Dutchman , Siegfried . Soprano Kirsten Flagstad joins him in the opening duet from Die Giterdmmerung . <P> Medieval and Renaissance Choral Music ( Choir of the Pius X School of Liturgical Music , conducted by Mother Georgia Stevens , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As glowing as a rose window , these early church melodies are sung to perfection by Mother Stevens ' famed female choristers . ( The Pius X School trains liturgical teachers chiefly , since women are ordinarily not supposed to sing in Catholic churches . ) As result of a mix-up in pressing , however , Tenor Melchior ( see above ) displaces the choir on one record .
