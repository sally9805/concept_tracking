In the enormous expansion of the U.S. Army Air Forces beginning in 1942 , old-time airmen felt sure they could see trouble ahead . It seemed inconceivable that inexperienced pilots could be rushed into hot new aircraft without sending accident rates skyhigh . Last week the oldtimers could congratulate themselves that they had been wrong . <P> The Army 's accident rate had gone down , not up . It was .11% lower per 1,000 hours flown in the first eight months of 1942 than it had been in the ten years from 1930 to 1940 , when the Air Corps prided itself on being a smart , seasoned outfit . The fatality rate had gone up , but only by a whisker : .014% . <P> For keeping military flying reasonably safe , the Air Forces could thank close command and the painstaking safety education of its fledglings ( TIME , Nov. 30 ) . In 1942 's first eight months , Army airmen flew almost twice as far as they did in the ten years ending in 1940.         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
