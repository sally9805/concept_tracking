One adjunct of the U.S. Army Air Forces will be out of operation by Christmas-and its members do not like the idea a bit . Last week , with appropriate regrets , General " Hap " Arnold , boss of U.S.A.A.F. , announced that the WASPs ( Women Airforce Service Pilots ) would be disbanded on Dec. 20 . <P> In a way , the WASPs , who had done a man-sized job of flying for the Army , had asked for it . Through their head woman , famed speed-flying Jacqueline Cochran ( wife of tycoon Floyd B. Odlum ) , they had demanded the same military status as the WACs , WAVEs , SPARs and Women Marines . In spite of Hap Arnold 's earnest support of the plan , which would have made Jackie Cochran a colonel , Congress had turned thumbs down . <P> Then the Air Forces ' ladies , fed up with civilian status , gave their ultimatum . Said Jackie Cochran : the WASPs should get military status or be washed out altogether . As Congress showed no disposition to change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Admitting that there were now enough men to carry on the WASPs ' jobs , principally ferrying of Army aircraft , he swung the washout brush , picked the December date " to permit the WASPs to reach their homes by Christmas . " <P> Home is where most WASPs will land , according to Mrs. Hazel Taylor , their public-relations officer , who predicted : " Their careers will be marriage . " Jackie Cochran 's own " tentative " plan is to run an orphanage on the Odium ranch in California . But airmen who heard such intimations of renunciation wondered . Flying is a habit hard to break .
