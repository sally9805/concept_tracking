Last week a Manhattan art gallery put on a show of the most popular form of art in the U.S. : newspaper cartooning . Reeves Lewenthal 's up- &-coming; Associated American Artists Gallery ( TIME , April 21 ) picked for its show one of the best and most widely reproduced editorial cartoonists in the U.S. : the St. Louis Post-Dispatch 's Daniel Robert Fitzpatrick . <P> The 45 cartoons in the show were a cross section of rabid Isolationist Fitzpatrick 's daily stint , from bulge-jawed Mussolinis and neurasthenic Hitlers to war-racked skeletons , the bums and shady politicians of St. Louis ' own legendary Rat Alley . Fellow cartoonists took their hats off to Fitzpatrick 's slick technique of getting his points over without capsizing his cartoons with explanatory captions . Fitzpatrick 's muscular draftsmanship and Dor-like spaciousness ( see cut ) are , if not art , something close to it . <P> Daniel Fitzpatrick , 50 , worked up into cartooning the hard way . Born in the industrial city of Superior , Wis. , he was kicked out of high school at 16 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and history . In Chicago he found he could make money turning out comic strips for the Chicago Evening News at $1 apiece . Before he was 21 the Evening News had hired him to do front page cartoons . A year later he heard that the St. Louis Post-Dispatch 's cartoonist had quit , got the job , started out with a cartoon attacking the old-fashioned wooden railroad coach by depicting one as a coffin on wheels . Today , after more than 27 years with the Post-Dispatch , sandy-haired , white-mustached Fitzpatrick is one of the four top-rank daily political cartoonists of the U.S. and the most belligerently individualistic of the four . ( The other three : the New York Post 's Rollin Kirby , the Baltimore Sun 's Edmund Duffy , Scripps-Howard 's Harold M. Talburt . ) Behind the scenes at the Post-Dispatch his editorial opinions sometimes clash with those of his bosses , Publisher Joseph Pulitzer and Editor Ralph Coghlan . <P> Feared by almost every public character in St. Louis , he complains : " The trouble with my job is I have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia : in Moscow the Museum of Modern Western Painting has eight Fitzpatricks hanging among its Renoirs and Gauguins . <P> A little overwhelmed at being considered an artist ( he has tremendous respect for the big names of U.S. painting , once spent a summer studying with Henry Varnum Poor ) , Cartoonist Fitzpatrick spent his time last week in a happy whirl of chats and drinks , bought a painting by Max Weber . As a concession to Art , Fitzpatrick had hung two oil paintings among his cartoons : one a Daumier-brown picture of a group of card players , the other a dour , Picassoesque self-portrait ( see cut ) . Of the latter he said sadly : " It was done in one of my blue periods , during a hangover . "
