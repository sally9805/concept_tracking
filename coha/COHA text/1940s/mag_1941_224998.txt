WAR &; PEACE <P> George Sylvester Viereck , 57 , is a U.S. citizen who has made a career of spreading German propaganda . That is a perfectly legal way for a U.S. citizen to make money , if he tells the Government what he is doing and who is paying him . Because Citizen Viereck has apparently been less than frank with the Government , he was in trouble last week . <P> Born in Munich , Viereck arrived in the U.S. at the age of eleven , went to college , became a naturalized citizen , leaped into letters . His first small fame bloomed with publication of a book of poetry , grew a little brighter because of a story that his father was the bastard son of William I of Prussia , which would make him Kaiser Wilhelm 's cousin . <P> More notoriety than fame accrued to George Viereck during World War I. After the sinking of the Lusitania by a U-boat , Viereck wrote : " The facts in the case absolutely justify the action of the Germans . Legally and morally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the U.S. " <P> His pro-German expressions aroused so much wrath among his Mt . Vernon , N.Y . neighbors that he asked police to protect his home . He was expelled from the New York Athletic Club , expelled from the Poetry Society of America . " But no executive committee , " cried he , " can take away from me my pass to Parnassus . " <P> Since Hitler 's rise , Viereck has taken up his trumpet again , has tooted lustily for Naziism . Several times the Government had turned a piercing eye on him . It hauled him in a year ago for a searching examination , and Viereck , who had properly registered as an agent of a foreign power , apparently told everything there was to tell . <P> But there were still a few things he kept to himself . According to a Federal grand jury charge , he had failed to relate , for instance , that he had supplied Congressmen with material for speeches so that he might get his propaganda into the Congressional Record and sent around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he had provided material for a book published under the authorship of Illinois Congressman Stephen A. Day , or that he had aided and financed the " non-interventionist " **31;9705;TOOLONG . For these and other oversights , last week Viereck was indicted on five counts , released on $15,000 bail . He pleaded not guilty . <P> Said he , with curled , pale lip : " My indictment is only an incident in the perfidious plot to smother and smear all opposition to the arbitrary forces cunningly at work to destroy the America we know and love .
