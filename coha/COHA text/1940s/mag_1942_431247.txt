 | The girl pushed her dark hair from her forehead with an exasperated gesture and said : " For heaven 's sake , Mother , why should I go out with Bob ? I do n't like him . " Evidently resolved to break up the argument , she buried her pained eyes in the luncheon menu . But Mama would n't let her get away with it . " Darling , it 's just that I do n't want you to be alone so much now that Charlie is in camp . After all , Charlie and you are not even engaged , " she said brightly . Mother and daughter were sitting at the restaurant table next to mine . The daughter was eighteen at the most . " Poor child , " I thought . " she is in love with Charlie , and Mama is a fool to try to make her go out with Bob , just to escape being alone . " And I thought : " Now there must be hundreds of thousands of girls like this one all over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are faced with the alternatives of going out with the Bobs or spending many evenings alone . If I had a daughter , I should want her above anything else to have the stamina to be alone . For self-sufficiency is the most important quality a woman can have . It gives her a sense of inner security ? the only security that counts ? and that makes her a happier and kinder woman . " The trouble at the root of many an unhappy and futile woman 's life , I should explain to my daughter these days , is that she feels humiliated at the thought of spending an evening at home with a book or music or just thinking about Charlie . Brought up on the idea that being " popular " means having lots of dates and parties all the time , every evening she spends alone becomes to her evidence of social failure and must be avoided like poison . This is where the Bobs come in . Mind you , Bob may be perfectly all right . Another girl might prefer him to Charlie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she the girl in the restaurant , Bob stands for everything second best , for all the ersatz people she will have to put up with if she ca n't face a date with herself . And I should warn my daughter that the Bobs have a rabbitlike way of multiplying in the lives of women who ca n't be alone . Their disarming reliability makes them a menace , because it makes a girl forget that to her they are only second bests and that it is really the more elusive Charlie she likes . Before she knows it , the Charlies get disgusted with her for cluttering her life with the Bobs and walk out . She is stuck with the Bobs , who always will form a wall between her and everything worth-while . It is all right to tell a daughter to be self-sufficient , but it is not enough . The main task is to explain how she should go about it . One does not become self-sufficient by ceasing to rush around in quest of popularity . Self-sufficiency is the result of strenuous training , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself with the use of one 's God-given faculties ? intellectual , moral , sensual , physical ? with a view to building up one 's inner resources and capacity for enjoying the great and real pleasures in life . In the first place , I should bring up my daughter to live with her books as with friends who are always there to comfort and stimulate her . A daughter of mine would be allowed to read any book ? except those of a strictly pornographic order ? at twelve . For though she may be too young to perceive the entire scope of a great novel by Tolstoy , Balzac , or Stendhal , at no period will she be so unconsciously sensitive to the beauty and majesty of a great artist 's concept . I should want my daughter to be familiar with the great events and figures of history . A young mind which understands that life went on though Rome fell and that nothing remains of Alexander but the legend of a dazzling young world conqueror , develops a philosophically detached and intelligent concern with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What is more : a historical perspective teaches one to view petty grievances and worries more intelligently and to take both them and oneself lightly . There is , I should try to show my daughter . an inimitable elegance in this sort of lightness that no dressmaker can create . Nor should I be afraid that through her reading my daughter would have too early a knowledge of things generally reserved for an older age . Insight into the cravings and passions of the human soul and into the strange and terrible workings of fate will teach her not to be outraged by wickedness , while she continues to admire goodness . Senses trained to perceive the beauties @#  | of this world are most important instruments with which to build up the inner resources that make for self-sufficiency . But one has to go about the training diplomatically , in order not to bore the very young . Most children are irritated when the beauties of nature and art are pointed out to them by their elders . A sort of magic transmission of one 's own enjoyment ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheer force of one 's own feeling and knowledge seems to me the best way to train a young girl 's senses to enjoy nature and art . It is comparatively easy to train a young girl to use her hands and like it . Cleaning a room and seeing it come alive , shining and new , is immensely gratifying . Cooking affords pleasure and suspense known only to artists . Slapping paint on furniture is bound to elate even the loneliest heart . Nor should I discourage my daughter from dabbling in painting , music , needlework , dilettante as her efforts may be . Somehow one gets particular fun out of things one does n't do especially well , and they , too , are important in building up one 's inner resources . I THINK a fundamental mistake of our modern education is that the young are babied at an age when in great historical epochs they were already people . I should want my daughter to realize at a fairly early age that she is on her own and that she alone must bear the consequences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early in a comparatively independent fashion , know all sorts of people , take care of her clothes and her money , make her own decisions without running to Mama . I know of no more effective way of helping her acquire a realistic knowledge of the . orld and a social sense , of weaning her from any inclination to self-pity , and of ' building up her sense of humor and her ability to take herself lightly . Being on her own at a fairly early age helps a girl , too , to get on with men . - Often it is said that men give a wide berth to the self-sufficient girl . But this true only if she directs her self-sufficency against men , as a tank directs its guns against the foe . This is , of course , a colossal mistake . Man is no enemy , and ng him is the simplest way of dealing ' th him . Nor did I ever see the little s tactics and strategies , which soed experts prescribe to women who h to get and hold their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have wn who were most successful with were not the most sophisticated or youngest or the most beautiful . But vitality , warmth , good humor , and ? ledge of the world seemed to make = irresistible . They had what Goethe eel a " listening soul " and the ability make men say brilliant things . They also the ability to create an atmosof quiet in which men could relax be themselves . us , if I had a daughter , I should her : " In order to get and hold your use your instinctive shrewdness , sense of values , your tact , and above your kindness . Try to understand and share their interests . Not that guarantees success . Nothing does . ca n't play safe in love , and nothing keep you from suffering . But if you  | are the person I want you to be , always have yourself to hold onto , matter how much you may suffer . . " Living , " I should say to my dau " is a great adventure .
