Victor Reuther decided to skip a special union conference in downtown Detroit and spend a quiet evening at home . The kids were sent up to bed as usual after dinner . A couple of friends dropped in to chat a while . After they left , Vic Reuther , a top policy strategist in the mighty C.I.O. United Auto Workers , picked up a morning paper and sat down in a straight-backed wooden chair to read . His wife Sophie lounged comfortably on a sofa a few feet away . <P> Suddenly a shotgun muzzle was thrust through the front living room window ; the crash of falling glass was drowned out by a double blast . A spray of lead pellets the size of peas ripped Vic Reuther 's head and right shoulder-his shattered eyeglasses and his dental bridge flew to the rug ten feet away . Slowly he rose , clutched his bleeding face , then fell to the floor crying , " Call an ambulance . " Sophie Reuther called police , then rushed screaming into the dark , empty street . <P> Keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Detroit almost to the last detail . Thirteen months before , an assassin had fired a shotgun through a kitchen window in the home of Vic 's elder brother Walter , and shot down the cocky , redheaded president of U.A.W. Walter Reuther 's right arm is still crippled from the blast that hit him . <P> Walter learned of his brother 's injury from a radio bulletin as he was riding home from a union session , accompanied by two bodyguards , in the armored car the union recently bought for him . At Redford Receiving Hospital he comforted 37-year-old Vic while the doctors pumped four pints of blood into him . " Remember , Vic , " said Walter , " how you held my hand a year ago . Now I 'm holding yours . Keep fighting , Vic , keep fighting . " Vic mumbled , " Look after the kids . . . and Sophie . " At Henry Ford Hospital , where he was transferred a few hours later , doctors dug six pieces of lead out of his body and removed his right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get the hard-driving Reuther boys of U.A.W. But who ? And why ? The Reuthers had made enemies in their climb to power in U.A.W. , but Vic , the quiet union educational director and behind-the-scenes strategist , insisted that he could not imagine who would want to kill him . Walter Reuther was n't quite sure either : " The same people who paid to have me shot paid to have my brother shot and for the same reason . They could be diehard elements among employers , or they could be Communist or fascist agents . " Michigan Senators Arthur Vandenberg and Homer Ferguson guessed that it was the Communists ( the party hotly denied it ) , got the U.S. Senate to call for FBI investigation . Others guessed that it might be the work of some crackpot , either anti-union or a U.A.W. man soured by bitter fights within the union .
