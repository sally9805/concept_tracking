THE INNOCENT EMPRESS-Erna Barschak-Duffon ( $3.50 ) . <P> <P> Women remember the late Eugenie Montijo as a certain Empress of France who wore a tilted wren's-nest hat which achieved a brief renascence in the ' 30s . <P> Refugee Erna Barschak presents her in this compassionate and entertaining " intimate study " as a rich sheaf of sorrows and symbols , a difficult but by no means unsympathetic human being . <P> " I should have lived , " Eugenie wrote when she was 17 , " a century earlier . The ideas that are dearest to me are now ridiculous . ... I have a mixture of dreadful passions in me . ... I fight against them , but I lose the struggle and in the end my life will end miserably , lost in passion , virtue and foolishness . " Eugenie was almost a textbook image of ambitious and dislocated womanhood , tinged with the dread occupational diseases of hysteria and frigidity . But in her flaming devotion to an idea , she was magnificent . Her 93 years were one long , un-flickering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this faith brought her marriage to Napoleon III , and helped make history , and helped unmake it . <P> Passion . Eugenie was born during an earthquake . Her father , a Spanish count who had served under Napoleon , was a sort of primitive Pavlov . He used to seat the nervous little girl astride a cannon and fire it off again &; again while , with the one good eye the wars had left him , he studied her reactions . Eugenie became a Napoleon-cultist , a frenzied romantic . After the death of her father , Eugenie and her mother wintered in Paris , where the new emperor , Louis Napoleon , fell passionately in love with her . But her marriage ( in 1853 ) was no love match ; she was infatuated by a symbol , and managed to trap it . <P> Erotically , she was a child . As for the Emperor , less complicated women dropped in his lap like plums , but he had neither the skill nor the patience to make a good wife of Eugenie . <P> Virtue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most bourgeois Court , barring Victoria 's , of a bourgeois century , did not make Eugenie a happy woman . So , like many another disenchanted housewife , Eugenie went in for good works with her sleeves up . She was a tremendously energetic , genuinely intrepid woman , and her conduct during a cholera epidemic endeared her to the public . And at a time when Frenchwomen were 80% illiterate , she did work of permanent value for the education of her sex . <P> Foolishness . Politics interested her more . Although her astute husband was not overimpressed with her political qualifications- " You never get an idea , " he told her , " the idea gets you " - his sense of guilt towards her made him yielding . Out of this stock suburban situation , a good deal of the fate of France took shape . <P> Eugenie can be fairly accused of profound " moral complicity , " if not worse , in the quick , awful , fumbled war with Prussia which shattered the regime . <P> The Flames Were Dimmed . Exiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a restoration . Louis Napoleon had no such delusions during the two years he lived . Their 17 - year- old son , Prince Louis , would make no play for public affection , by which alone a restoration might have been conceivable ; it was a Napoleon 's business , he insisted , to be a soldier . He was killed in Zululand.
