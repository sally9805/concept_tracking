Wolf-suckled were mythical Romulus and Remus who founded Rome in 753 B.C. In 1940 A.D. from South Africa came a scarcely more credible tale of a black boy reared among baboons ( TIME , April 1 ) . Between these doubtful tales are 22 cases of children reared in the wilds by wolves , bears , leopards , etc. to which anthropologists credit some authenticity. * But only one case is open to real scientific study : the wolf-children of Midnapore , whose rescuer described them with camera and diary . World authority on these incarnations of Kipling 's Mowgli is Anthropologist Robert Mowry Zingg of the University of Denver , who has taken over the records of the case , will soon publish a book on it . Last week in The Scientific American he presented a brief preview of his material . <P> In October 1920 the Rev. J. A. L. Singh , an Anglican missionary , was hunting among the pagan jungle tribes of northwest India . At a remote village he heard of a " man-ghost " who lived seven miles away under an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blind near the ant hill , settled down at dusk to watch . <P> A grown-up wolf ( he wrote ) came out of one of the holes . This animal was followed by another of the same size and kind . The second was followed by a third , closely followed by two cubs , one after the other . Close after the cubs came . . . a hideous-looking creature-hand , foot and body like a human being . Close at its heels came another awful creature , exactly like the first , but smaller . Their eyes were bright and piercing , unlike human eyes . However , I at once came , to the conclusion that they were human beings . . . . <P> Two days later Singh and a few natives dug open the wolves ' den . They slew the fiercely protective mother wolf , rescued the two waifs who nestled snarling among the wolf cubs . How they got in the den and whence they came were never discovered . Secretly the missionary put the wolf-children , females aged about two and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pictures of their development . <P> Before he could make human beings of the waifs , Amala and Kamala , Singh had to break them of their deeply ingrained wolf ways . They had to be tied into bed , tore off clothing as savagely as wolf cubs , dreaded daylight , at night howled eerily as they had with the jungle pack , at ten , one and three o'clock . They lapped milk from a dish in imitation of the orphanage dogs , whose company they preferred to other children 's . They craved raw meat , and Kamala was once caught devouring chicken entrails which her sensitive wolf-nose had located in a garbage pail . For months they could not walk upright ; their muscles were powerfully developed for loping on all fours . <P> Humanizing of Kamala , the elder , was hindered by the death of Amala , whose wolf-ways were not so set . But like a dog , Kamala in time came to trust Mrs. Singh , whose hand always fed her . She became " a pathetic little subnormal , but clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vocabulary of 50 words , interest in clothing ( if it was red ) , ability to run simple errands and play with other children . Kamala died at 17 , unmarried . <P> By rearing two children in a wolf den , fate performed an experiment which the maddest scientist would not dare . But sane Dr. Zingg is pleased with the valuable evidence that :
