txt The Senate last night overrode the wishes of the Administration anc added an excess profits levy to the pending revenue net of 1940 The excess profits tax . written into the Senate bill provides a scale of taxes somewhat similar to those imposed in the last World War . It is a levy based on the invested capital of corporations . It was adopted by a 41 to 31 vote After allowing a specific exemption of $3.000 and an amount equal to S ' , - of the invested capital . the tax would be computed as follows : of the taxable income in excess of the allowed credits and not in excess of 20 , ; - of the invested capital : and 40 , , of the net income in excess of 20 , ; . of the invested capital . Fate in Howse in Doubt There was considerable doubt last night as to just what attitude the House will take toward the La . Follette amendment when the tax bill is sent to conference for adjustment of differences between the House and ' Senate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the House ways and means committee agreed to leave the so-called " war profits tax " issue untu the next session of Congress . This decision had the approval of the Treasury Department and was based on the rather general feeling that taxes of this character would have to be prepared with great care to prevent them from interfering with plans to speed up industrial production of war materials . The desire to avoid the issue raised in the La Follette amendment was responsible , in large measure , for the decision of the ways and means committee to bring the tax bill before the House under a strict " gag " rule which prohibited amendments from being offered from the floor . Last night , Chairman Doughton of the ways and means committee , who will head the House conferees on the tax bill , declined to forecast the position the House will take on the La Follette proposal . He said the ways and means committee would want to give the amendment careful consideration . In other quarters , the belief was expressed that if the House conferees balk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view of the fact that the amendment was not sponsored by the finance committee . Proposed by Senator LaFollette ( Frog. , Wis. ) , the excess profits tax would be in addition to all other taxes levied and would be applicable to corporate incomes for taxable years beginning after December 31 , 1939 . Allow Inventory Losses Only corporations specifically exempt from the excess profits tax are personal service corporations . personal holding companies and foreign personal holding companies to which surtaxes already apply . For corporations subject to the tax , deductions would be allowed for losses sustained on inventories and a " reasonable " deduction for the amortization of the cost of plant or equipment installed after January 1 , 1940. for production of war supplies . A tentative estimate of the amount of such amortization for any year should not exceed 12 ' *. % of the cost of the facilities borne by the taxpayer . According to the La Follette amendment the term " invested capital " means : ( 1 ) actual cash paid in for stock ; ( 2 ) actual cash value of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock , at the time of such payment , " but in no case to exceed the par value of the original stock or shares specifically issued therefor , unless the actual cash value of such tangible property at the time paid in is shown * ? to have been clearly and substantially in excess of such par value , in which case such excess shall be treated as paid-in surplus . " The adoption of the . La Follette excess profits levy occurred while Senate leaders were attempting in a night session to complete action on the revenue bill which generally increases income and excise taxes by 10% and authorizes a $4,000,000,000 increase in the federal debt limit .
