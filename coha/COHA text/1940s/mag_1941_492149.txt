would wait until he arrived and exchange a few words with him , man to man , before they strolled down to the confectioner 's . Next door , Kirby Harron 's younger brother , Lee , waited just to speak to Phil as he passed the Harron gate . Lee leaned on the gatepost , playing with a buggy whip from his father 's harness shop . Lee was fourteen , though large for his years , and he imitated his brother in the casual manner in which he addressed Phil Edwards . He bad the words formed in his mouth , " Hi , Phil , " when he saw a man grossing the street from the other side . It seemed that everyone on the block saw that man at the same time , and they all knew he was moving toward Phil . Lee wanted to yell out to Phil . Afterward , nearly everybody on the porches said they had wanted to do something too . But , in a way , it was not the business of any of them . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what had been going on with his wife and Phil Edwards . All the voices on the block hushed . The street grew so still you could hear the drone of the June bugs . There was nothing else except the soft steps of I Phil on the brick sidewalk . Then he faltered , as Gilly Wingfield stepped on the curb with steel glistening in his hand . Pale streaks jumped out and the small bright thunder deafened the street , He fired five times and Phil Edwards was already on the ground when the pistol snapped . on an empty chamber . Gilly raised his head and stared upward , like a man coming out of a trance . Then Annie Gooch screamed and young Kirby Harron jumped from the steps of the Gooch porch and ran toward the street . From next door his mother cried , " Come back , Kirby ! He 'll kill you too ! " Everyone else was shouting then , and other men were running from their porches . Fourteen-year-old Lee Harron tumbled out of the gate to join his brother . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Mrs. Harron , murmuring to herself , moved uncertainly after her husband . Gilly Wingfield was hacking away , still clutching the gun and staring at the dead man as if he had never seen him . before . Then Kirby Harron reached him and swung . Gilly staggered under the blow . The boy followed , striking out in blind hate . Gilly went down , covering his head with both hands . The gun slid away and somebody snatched it up . Several men started to pull Kirby off . He fought at them . " It wo n't do any good now , Kirby , " they kept saying . " Phil 's dead . " Gilly was being dragged across the street by a swelling crowd . Ladies faltered around the edges and some of them were crying and others were trying to talk , but no one listened to anyone else . Kirby Harron grew quiet . " Where is Phil ? " he asked . " He 's in the Gooches ' . " That was his young brother , Lee . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and " " Saw him , " Mrs. Harron said mechanically . She had walked up behind them . " Oh , Kirby , why do you do things like that ? If it was n't bad enough  --  right in front of our house ? " Then she saw that Kirby was embarrassed in front of the other men and she sighed . " Well , you come on in the house now . " " I want to go in the Gooches ' first , mamma , " Kirby said . " Then you come in , Lee . " " I want to stay with Kirby . " In her shocked bewilderment , Mrs. Harron seized upon this one certainty . " You are coming with me , sir , " she said . " Kirby might be his own man now , but you are not yet . " Mr. Harron joined them . " Do what your mother says , son . " He went with Kirby into the Goodies ' house . Leslie Gooch 's father was talking to the doctor , standing beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sofa with his head back on the curve of the arm . Blood rolled darkly on the green cloth and spotted brightly an antimacassar that had not been moved . Mr. Gooch had taken of Phil 's high-buttoned coat and opened his shirt , and Kirby saw it was inside there that all the bullets had gone . His stomach heaved and he started to turn away . He made himself look . The gold glittered in a cuff link in one of Phil 's white cuffs , which still looked fresh . It had been just after supper when Phil inserted the link with the hand that wrote the neatest of any clerk in Richmond . There was n't anything Kirby could say . His father was talking to Mr. Gooch . Somewhere in the house he heard women 's voices . He supposed Mrs. Gooch was trying to comfort Annie , because one of the sounds was like a lady crying . Then his father turned away and nodded , and Kirby followed him out . Outside , the air tasted good . Kirby felt sorry for Leslie Gooch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . His sister was going with a bookkeeper , too , and it could have happened to them . If it had , he 'd feel like he had to kill somebody . That was the way he felt when he ran out . after Gilly Wingfield . It was n't just poor Phil . When he heard Annie scream , he knew what Wingfield had done to her , too , to Leslie and the Gooches , to his own family and all the neighborhood . Kirby had to do something then , because it was more than he could stand . Hitting ( idly Wingfield had n't done any good . The hate was still in him , but it was n't for Gilly any more . He did n't know what it was for . His father said to him , " That 's what comes of fooling with another man 's wife , and that Wingfield will get off on the unwritten law . " " It does n't matter about him . Phil was a fool . " " I do n't know about that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless you know what 's in his heart . Phil made a mistake taking up with the wrong kind of woman when he loved a sweet girl and ? " He made a mistake by the way he went about things . If he had n't acted like a fool , this would n't ' ye happened here the way it did . " " Now . Kirby , remember the poor fellow 's dead . That could be any one of us . " He shook his head . " Yes , sir ! " " It could be any of us around here . It would n't happen to people like the Bowerses . " " You and the Bowerses ! Forget the Bowerses . Let 's go inside and see your mother . She 'll he pretty upset about all this . " " I 'll be in a little later , papa . I want to go to the store . " Kirby moved fast through the deepening shadows of the old street and turned into the grocery store . He paused in the doorway , checked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kegs of fish , and a crowd was helping the grocery-man pick up the salt mackerel and herring . When they saw Kirby , all of them swung toward him . They were laughing , but there was something else in their eyes . They recognized him as another man , no longer a kid , as they bunched around him to shake his hand . " Where 'd you get those muscles ? Wrassling paper bales in the mill ? " " It want nothing , - he mumbled . " Wa n't nothing ? I would n't run out at any murderer with a gun in his hand , even if I did think it was empty . ' ' " No , sir ! You must be a real chum to Leslie . " The groceryman yelled , " Ai n't ary one of you go ' be a real chum to me if you do n't get these fish up . " Slowly , by ones and twos , they turned away , still talking . Slowly , Kirby hacked through the door . They did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It had nothing to do with Leslie , and he had never thought of the pistol . It was something in himself . He slipped through the door and almost ran back through the heavy shadows of the trees . Nearing his house , he slowed down . For the first time in his life he did n't want to go back . He did n't know what he wanted to do , only his home was no longer a place waiting for him . T WO nights after the funeral , Leslie Gooch told Kirby of the shame brought upon his family . They were walking toward the park with Kirby 's big younger brother , Lee , lumbering beside them . The neighborhood was quiet again , except for kids playing duck on davy at the corner . The evening was sweetly warm . Couples strolled along as if nothing had ever happened . Young girls talked in low voices on porch steps and pretended not to notice the boys swaggering past , and the boys , raising their voices , pretended they did n't know they were being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resented the way Leslie Gooch accepted the shooting . " I know things wo n't ever be the same with me , " Leslie kept saying . " Annie will never get over it , and papa and mamma wo n't either . Boy , a thing like this surely changes you . " " It ought to change everybody around here , " Kirby said . " We ought to live somewhere that things like this couldn't. happen . " " Where you live has n't got anything to do with it , Kirby , but it looks like you ca n't think of nothing else except that it happened in our neighborhood . " " I ca n't . " The boys turned into Church Street , moving in the shadows of the large houses built toward the park . " Well , that ai n't the thing , and nobody on the block but you thinks so . You see , Phil always spent every cent he made , and then a lot of the time he owed a lot of money for his clothes  --  sometimes nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred . . . dollars ! " Fourteenyear-old Lee tried to conceive it . " Yes.suh , he was a real spender . Then when the time came to get married , he could n't afford it , and that 's how he got into all this trouble . " " That 's loony. - " It sure is , " Lee agreed with his brother.March 1,1941 They ' , baled the drive around the park and Kirby pointed to a couple in a two-horse carriage . The man and woman were laughing , and the boys saw a diamond sparkle in the man 's silk tie as he threw back his head . " Fellows like that could do it and there would n't be any shooting in front of your house , with your mother to see it and know what it was about . " " Maybe fellows like that can , but that 's not what I 'm talking about , " Leslie was getting stubborn at having his new ideas denied . " Anyway , I 'm going ; to save my money , so when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait . I do n't ever want any more disgrace to come on my family . " " All right . If you were like that man in the carriage we passed , you could do what you wanted and you would n't bring any disgrace on your family . " " I 'd like to know how a man like that can help it . " They crossed the walk and stood on the grass on the crest of the hill . They sat on the edge of the hill , their legs resting on the slope . Below , the James River curved around the factories and mills and docks , and down near the big bend a Norfolk boat glided along with lights shining on the water . On the Manchester side a freight train whistled in the darkness . Kirby said , The whole thing would just be different . You 'd live where everybody did n't know your business , like in one of those big houses behind the park . Nobody knows what 's going on in them . " " Then you 'd have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's being free of people , being  --  being bigger than people around here are . " " If that 's not being rich , I do n't know what it is . " Leslie shoved at the dry grass with his heel . " Well , maybe I do n't know exactly myself so I can tell you , but I really do know . " " Is that what you want to be ? " ( Continued on Page 33 ) ( Continued from Page 30 ) " Yeh , I do . I want to be away from a place where things like Phil 's being shot in front of your house can happen at all , whether it 's to me or somebody else . " " You talk like people ai n't good enough for you , all at once . " Leslie was sullen . " The things they do ai n't good enough for me , I 'll tell you that . " Leslie did not speak for a minute . They heard him breathing hard , and then he scrambled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's the way you feel about it , but I 'm not going to take this off you ! " He hacked away . " But we 'll see who 's right . I 'm go ' stop working in the factory . I 'm going in the office like Phil was . I 'll be as good a bookkeeper as he ever was , maybe better . Maybe I 'll even work in a bank . Then you 'll see if I 'm good enough for you . Then you wo n't be good enough for me , any more than what you are for the Bowerses . " He turned and ran across the park . Kirby did n't move . " You let him get away with that ? " Lee gasped at his brother . " He has n't got away with anything . I feel sorry for him . " Lee brooded over that , watching the people stroll past . Then he said , " I sure did n't know you thought all that you told Leslie . " " I did n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then ? " " Yeh , I meant it . I just did n't know it before . " The bell tolled in the Methodist church and Lee squirmed around to rise . " It 's nine o'clock . " He waited expectantly for his brother to start . Kirby did n't want to go home . He looked at Lee , who was hoping he would come , and a sudden wave of tenderness rushed over him . It was a tenderness for all his people , suffocating him , so he did n't know how to relieve it any more than he knew what started it . Somehow he had to help them all , so they would n't ever be sad like Lee was now , waiting on something he had no control over that would give him happiness . He had to find a way to help them , just as he had told Leslie he would . He jumped up . " Let 's hurry up then , " he said , " so we 'll have time to stop off for some ice cream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next night Kirby hurried home 1 from work to tell his family how he was going to help them . He ran whistling into the front room . The shades , which had been drawn all day against the heat , had just been raised , and the family was grouped around the open windows for the small dusk breeze , He tossed his cap on the hatrack and turned , and then he went . completely still . Every one of them faced him with reproachful resentment and , with no greeting , his sister Janie opened the attack . Leslie Gooch had told his father about his argument with Kirby , and the Gooches would scarcely speak to them because Kirby had said they were not good enough for the Harrons , and , Janie finished , " I was going to be a bridesmaid at Annie 's wedding . " Mrs. Harron , nervously fluffing her skirts about her ankles , took it up . " We 've lived next door to them since we all came to Richmond after the war  --  when we were all poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and now you 've told them your kinspeople are better than they are . Mercy , I ? " " it 's you mentioning the Bowerses that I ca n't understand , " his father said . Bonny Herron was a huge man , with a high-growing black beard , and he had been an enemy of his wife 's people , the Bowerses , for sixteen years . Because of him , Kirby answered , " I never mentioned the Bowerses . That was Leslie . " " Oh , " his mother sighed , " I do n't care who mentioned what . You did tell him you wanted to move away from here , did n't you ? " a " That 's just the kind of talk that started all the trouble , son . I do n't know what 's come over you . " " I 'd like to see what comes over him , " Janie said , " when he hears about Leslie . " " What about Leslie ? " " He , " his sister said triumphantly , " has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he 'll be a clerk like Willie while you 're still in the shipping room ! " " Not unless he starts tonight , he wo n't . " The whole family cried out at once , everyone jumping up except Granny . Dark and solid , she had just waited . Kirby said , " I 'm starting in the office at the paper mill tomorrow morning . " They were too shocked and surprised to compliment him on his advance , or at first even to think of it . While they gaped at him , his mother spoke for them all , " Why did n't you tell us ? " " I have n't had a chance , mamma . You all jumped on me about Leslie the minute I came in the house . " " I know , but . . . we did n't even know you were trying to get it . " " I did n't want to say anything about it until I knew I had it . " " That 's fine of you , Kirby , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the new position too . " " Yes , it certainly is , " the others echoed . " But I do n't understand why you keep things to yourself the way you do . I did n't even suspect you were n't happy in the shipping room . " " I was happy enough . I just decided I was n't getting anywhere that way . " " You decided it , " Janie snapped , " to get ahead of Leslie Gooch . It was all after your fuss with him . " " It was after that , all right , but not to get ahead of him . I said I wanted to get ahead and he said he was going in the office , and I saw that was the way to do it . " They looked only the more baffled . Bonny moved over near him , uneasy and uncertain . " But , son , how did you do it ? Mr. Broughton 's had old man Cary in the office there since the war . " " That 's what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been in the same job too long . He was slow and he made mistakes . It took time for the rest of us to get them straight . The mill 's not doing too good and I told him he could save money by putting me in the office . I 'll get paid less than Cary , and a new man , without experience , in my place in the shipping room , will get paid less than me . You could put a kid out there if you did n't have to watch out for mistakes from the office and do things twice . " " What did Mr. Broughton say ? " It was an awed whisper from his father . He gave me the job . " " Letting poor old man Cary go ? " Kirby nodded . They all stared uncomprehendingly at him , as if suddenly before their very eyes he had changed into something strange and foreign , removed from their ken and yet somehow of it . Hurt showed slowly in Kirby 's eyes , and resentment of the hurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you all looking at me like that for ? Like I 've shot somebody or stolen something . " " No . . . . No , son , " his mother and father started together , and then Emily went on , " It 's just that we were sort of taken aback and  --  and it seems such a step . Are you sure you can manage a job like that ' ? " " I said I would , did n't I ? " As she faltered again , Granny spoke for the first time , " He 'll do it all right , just like he got the job when he said he would . There 's one thing about Kirby  --  ever since he was a baby , whenever he said he was going to do something he did it . " They all agreed , all with the same stunned bewilderment . Watching them , Kirby understood suddenly why they stared at him so oddly . He was removed from them , and he knew , in that frightening moment of clarity , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beau , called from the door . " Good heavens , " Emily cried , " it 's Willie 's night for supper and we have n't even set the table ! " Janie , straightening her organdy dress , hurried into the hall , The others followed Emily hack to the kitchen . Lee went last , watching his brother . Kirby did not see him . The light was fading and he did not see that either . He was aware of nothing except how lonely he was all at once . IV F OR three years Kirby Harron followed a lonelier way than ever he had dreamed existed . So simple a thing as changing from the shipping room to the mill office could change his whole life , until nothing seemed any more as it had been and even the most familiar took on strange meanings . At home the family no longer understood what he was trying to do , though he worked for their good . With a larger salary , he saved a good deal of his money , prevailed on his mother to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and even ( Continued on Page 35 ) ( Continued from Page 33 ) froth the occasional chunks Bonny brought in from his horse deals . Pooling these savings , Kirby invested them himself ? only to have everybody regard him uneasily . It was against nature for a young man to think of putting by instead of spending , and his father was troubled to see him figuring in his room of a night instead of going out with the boys . His father was troubled , too , at the way Kirby assumed control of the finances , and there had been some tense passages between them . Afterward , Bonny Harron , smoldering with his unexpressed violence , would go off to another fair or horse show and neglect his harness shop . Kirby would take stronger hold of the house then and , to fill the new loneliness of his nights , study on new plans for his people . The only one who encouraged him was Willie Costello , who had married Janie , and in the fall of 1884 they had a baby girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family to a new house . He had done a lot of figuring with Kirby , and one night he announced , " If Janie and I came to board with you , Kirby could take on a four-thousand-dollar mortgage for a new house of our own . " Granny said nothing , just rocking stolidly beside the stove , her face dark with scowls . Her hearing had failed a little in the past few years , but she could hear Willie well enough . She just did n't like what she heard . " That foolish cackle of his , like a half-grown rooster , " she called it . Granny was used to big men , and she could never stomach Willie 's dainty ways . Why he wore the most open wing collars on East Hill she could never understand , for she had never seen a scrawnier neck on a man , and she simply could n't look at his fluffy blond sideburns and mushy mustache . Emily tightened Bonny 's handkerchief , that was wrapped around her head , holding vinegar-soaked brown paper against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my headache so much worse I could jump out of my skin . " Kirby said , " This is not just talk this time , mamma . Interest on a mortgage would n't be any more than what we 're paying rent here . With Willie 's board , we could meet taxes and insurance and make improvements . And I know a house we could get for seven hundred and fifty cash , with taking over the mortgage . It 's out on the park , and that would be a fine place for us . " " The park ? " Granny grunted . " Ai n't nothing out there but weeds . Better for to move back to the country and " That 's the point , " Kirby said with growing conviction . " Church Street is going to be extended to include the park . It 'll be a grand street , facing the park , and the property will be very valuable . Only the owner of this house do n't know Church Street is going to he extended , so he 's offering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " He might as well ask a million , " Emily protested . " But , mamma , we 've saved five hundred dollars . Granny has two-fifty of her own . With that seven-fifty offered him in cash , I 'll bet the owner would n't turn it down . He 's sick of holding the place , because he can rent it now only for country property . " " But I ai n't sick of holding on to what 's my own , " Granny said . " I 've got to have something put by against my old age . " " I 'm all you need against your old age , Granny . And if it ever came to where you needed that two-fifty , that would n't be enough to do you any good . " " Where 'd you get such thoughts , boy ? " Emily groaned , shifting her handkerchief-paper bandage . " What I ca n't get used to is how he 's willing to cheat this man out of - " " I 'm not cheating him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If I know the street is going through and he does n't , it 's worth something to me for knowing it . " " Lord , look down , " Granny muttered . Kirby 's mother stared at him , her eyes frightened . " Kirby , I know you want to help us and all , but ? " " ' Tai n't no buts about it , " Granny said flatly . " His father would n't hear of it . " " That 's right , son , " Emily said , " and I wish you would n't goad your father too far . He does n't like the way you 're running things now . " His enthusiasm crushed again , Kirby blurted , " Well , I do n't like the way he is either ! " The words between them were out at last , and all of them knew they had been coming for a long time , and there was nothing more to add now or to sub-tract , Unexpectedly , Granny said , " You can have my money if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this woodshed , freezing every winter , and I never did hold it was fitten for a family not to own their own home anyway . But that 's between you and your father , and I do n't want anything to do with that . " Emily looked uncertainly from one to the other . Desperately she said , " Kirby , where did you learn about the Church Street extension ? " " By not doing what papa does  --  talking when he should he listening . Now I 'm going out and listen some more . Maybe I can learn how to make you all willing to be moved to a better place ? of your own . " He hurried out of the room . His favorite place of listening in the evening was the hotel bar . He would buy one beer , or at the most two , and listen to the men talk . They paid no heed to the pour young man leaning near them , but Kirby forgot nothing they said . Through listening to them , he had learned that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the extension of Church Street to include the park . That was a secret , going no farther than the bar , but Kirby would profit , because he never made the mistake of " talking when he should be listening . " He knew he was not welcome in that hotel bar , and it bothered him , but neither the bartenders nor the customers suspected it . He walked quietly through the swinging doors , paused to pick a spot near the most important-looking group . Tonight they were mostly sports , flashy men who gave themselves loud words and vain boastings . He had learned to distinguish those , but he always listened . Sometimes they dropped secrets too . The bartender scowled as Kirby ordered a beer . Kirby returned the glance with a cold , hard gaze and the bartender turned away . He hooked his worn heel over the rail , spat in the braes spittoon , and settled an elbow on the bar . Tonight the talk seemed settled on shows and fancy women and old Broadway . His attention fading , Kirby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and how now it was time to take a stand . At the mill , he knew he had made himself solid . In his first year in the office he had kept strictly to himself , for fear the old gentleman would discover how hard the ciphering came to him . His job had been to keep an account of all raw materials used , both to determine the cost of a paper run and the amount of stock on hand . He used to take his work home and get Willie Costello , an expert bookkeeper , to help him straighten out his inventories . By the second year he reached the point where he could handle it all alone during the days . and he broadened the scope of his work to figure out the cost of a paper run himself . At nights , Willie taught him the shortcuts of arithmetical tricks , and soon Kirby was doing work which Mr. Broughton bad done himself when old man Cary was there . Even though this freed Mr. Broughton of clerical routine and gave him more time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his work or took him into his confidence . From Kirby 's own figurings during the past year , he knew the paper mill was clearing expenses for the first time since it had been burned during the war , but Mr. Broughton never seemed pleased . Whenever he said anything to Kirby , aside from business , it was to complain of the changes in Richmond . " Too many new people have come in , " he said in his precise old-fashioned drawl . " They do n't do business as Virginians did before . I think , in being forced to behave like the carpetbaggers , tv prevent them from stealing the whole state , some of our citizens have learned to like their ways . All I can see is that we 'll eventually he run by arrogant poh whites and silk-hatted cutthroats . " Particularly he hated the large Model Paper Company , a corporation that arose during Reconstruction . " A heartless , inhuman machine , " he would orate , " run by its stockholders , just like the Gold Bugs that arise everywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the North will strangle us all worse than the armies of the Yankees , and the Model , right here in our city , is aping them . Kirby gave no heed to any of the ideas of Mr. Broughton , nor these of anyone else , which did not affect his immediate personal problems . Now his problem was his father , who had sworn he would never move again , not to please a living soul . Bonny Harron had come from a plantation , where , with his father and three brothers , they had raised a little tobacco , but spent most of their time racing and trading horses , fishing and hunting most any creature of the woods that flew or walked . They never had cash and always had debts , but those black-bearded giants held a way of life they would n't swap for a king 's . That way was lost in the war , and with it went Bonny 's father and two of his brothers , and the other brother , ( Continued an Page 37 ) ( Continued from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the county court and nursed a cough which he claimed only store-bought whisky would cure . Bonny had married Emily Bowers , whose family 's plantation was virtually a model and whose brothers were successful men in Richmond  --  Walter an officer in an old , conservative bank and Buford a fashionable doctor . They had accepted Emily 's marriage to Bonny well enough during the war , when no man was more honored than a scout with Jeb Stuart 's cavalry , and Bonny made a glorious figure in his yellow-sashed uniform , before fighting and hunger thinned him out . But after the , war it was a different story . Then the Bowerses could not bear thinking of their sister and her two babies living on the Harrons ' ramshackle plantation , deteriorated even more by the four years of neglect . They told Bonny this , told him in their austere parlor on East Franklin , told him in their quiet , steady voices , with their gray eyes showing no feeling whatsoever . Bonny had lost his temper , all his inherent violence trying to crash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had in the summer of 1865 . Nearly twenty years had passed since then , and the men had never spoken again . Bonny had been a poor provider , becausa the ways of the city were not his ways , but life had not been bad so long as he had his escape . Neglecting his harness shop from time to time , he followed county fairs and race meets , trading horses and running them as of old . He never lost money and sometimes made a little , and he thought they were getting along all right until Kirby wanted to move to another neighborhood . On Jefferson Street they were all poor together , like nearly e ' erybody was after the war , but where Kirby wanted to go , the people were beginning to grow modestly well off again and holding themselves proud . Now Kirby had completed all his plans for huying the new house , and never a word had he said of it to Bonny . Bonny waited and waited until he had about decided that Kirby was just dreaming . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ casually , " Papa , would n't you like to take a walk and look at the new house ? " His children were there , and his wife and mother , his brother and his son-in-law and his baby granddaughter , and suddenly he could n't bellow as he had thought he would , and shout , " Plague the house ! I 'll never move ! " Almost before he knew it , he and Kirby were strolling together along Church Street , the old part where big brick houses stood in cold and solid formality , their stone steps and brass knockers shining . ? nny knew Kirby was trying to show him how much nicer the new house would he for the family , and in his heart Bonny recognized that it was , just as he admitted to himself that Kirby was taking better care of them than he ever had . That knowledge had kept him still all the past weeks , and it kept him agreeable now , though he dreaded each block which brought them nearer the park . The houses were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their facades and thick columns of coal smoke curled from the chimneys . Bonny could not repress the recollections of his simpler days which these handsome homes evoked . " See , they 've got a lot of big fires going in these houses . ' Twa n't many like that on the Hill when we first came to Richmond . The only one we had was in the kitchen , and we all had to dress together there of a morning . But we had our good times then , because all of us were poor together . " Kirby spoke very carefully . " I know , papa , but it 's nearly twenty years since the war now and everybody 's not poor any more . Richmond is building up again , and it 'll grow even bigger than it was before , Mr. Broughton said . " Bonny nodded , stealing a glance at this strange young man who was his son . Not so tall as Bonny and leaner , Kirby stood just under six feet and his strong frame had not yet filled out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though Kirby would never have looked the man he had in a cavalry uniform , he wore city clothes as Bonny never could . The sloping shoulders , powerful enough , were not so padded with muscle as to wrinkle the cut of his new overcoat , and the velvet collar set him off like a real beau . He carried himself like one , too ; his head held high and his derby slanted back the way they were worn on East Franklin . Seeing him in profile , the set of his face suggested the Bowerses , but what disturbed Bonny was the thing in his eyes that . was neither Bowers nor Barron . Ever since he had first noticed it in Kirby , Bonny had lost his ease with his son . " I reckon this is the time for young fellows like you . You 've never been hurt by the war and you 've always known the city like it is now . You do n't remember well those days during Reconstruction when a man could n't go on the street at night without a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a horde of poor , ignorant , savage Negroes on us , and you expected footpads in every shadow . " " I know things were hard for you , papa , but they 're go ' be different now for us all . You know everybody will feel better to be in their own home . " He would n't , but nobody asked him any more . They listened to Kirby . He made himself say , " / reckon so . They 're sure different enough . " Then Kirby said suddenly , " Look , there 's the house ! " Set hack about fifty feet from the winding drive , the white frame two-storied house stood bleakly in a field of weeds . It was higher and wider and deeper than the house they lived in now , but the porch was narrow and cheerless , with puny little columns , as if the owner 's money had run out when he reached the porch . Black gloom settled on Bonny . Worse than he had feared , the lonely house looked cold and desolate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ending at the hill where the hospital used to stand . Kirby saw his expression and spoke quickly , " You see , papa , houses will build up around it when Church Street comes through . That 's how we got it so cheap now . They 're going to widen the drive and straighten it , so it 'll come close to the house . Then there 'll be a paved sidewalk , and behind that we 'll have our own front yard . With a fence around it and all , maybe some flowers , it 'll look a lot nicer and  --  well , ca n't you picture that ? " Bonny knew he should say something , but his picture of being way out here away from his old neighbors was smothering him . " I was just thinking , " he mumbled , " there wo n't be much to see out here , will there ? " " Maybe not at first . " The enthusiasm was gone from Kirby 's voice . " No , " Bonny agreed lamely . They came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Bonny could not help faltering . The wind whined around them and flapped his coat about his big legs . " Let 's go in , " Kirby said . Bonny had determined to be agreeable at all costs , but he could not bring himself to enter that empty house . The sun glinted on its bare windows and swirls of dust eddied along the thin porch . Bonny tried to think up some excuse . Kirby had walked forward . Now he paused and turned . " Well , do n't you want to go in ? " It was an impatient voice , a Bowers voice , the voice of all that part of Richmond that had hounded and hurt him . Under it , all his hard-held restraint broke , and with it went the control over his deeper resentment that had been forming all through the past long months . " No , " he blurted , and then his voice rose . " No , damn it , I do n't want to go in ? now nor never ! " He glared at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words would release . But he was looking at eyes turned suddenly cold . They were brown like his own , but while his were all crazy and hot , these were still and hard . He could see Kirby holding them steady against him , like his mother 's people did , and that broke him completely . " You think I should be happy to go in such a house , do n't you ? You think it 's better than anything I 'm used to . Well , let me tell you something . I lived in a house on our plantation a lot finer than this nasty little shack stuck out here in the woods . I 've been used to something in my life too . You can act . around the house all you want like nobody knows anything but you , like everybody 's got to do what you say , but you 'll never get . me to act like I think this is wonderful nor be anything but sorry the day I have to set foot in it . And I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can put that in your pipe and smoke it . " He was shaking when he finished , tensed for violence , for release with his body and his inflamed brain . But Kirby never moved a muscle , never shifted his brown eyes . He said , " I reckon that 's been in your craw a long time , and now it 's out , I hope you feel better . But since you brought it . up , I 'll tell you something too . I took charge of things at home because you did n't . Every time you did n't know what to do , you left your harness shop and went off to some fair or horse show . That was all right . for you . It kept you from worrying . But you went off and left mamma without food many 's the time and " " I do n't want to hear any more from you . " You never wanted to hear anything you did n't like . But mamma did n't want to accept charity from the Bowerses either . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told you , I remember , I was six years old . Uncle Buford sent us a big basket of food , because we did n't have any in the house . He sent it by his nigger butler too ! Yes , he drove up in a fine carriage , that black buck , all in a uniform , and he handed mamma that basket like she was something you would n't spit on . She cried when he went away , but we had to eat the food . I remember that too . It was the first time I 'd ever seen an olive , and it tasted like hell , and mamma said they had always eaten them in her family . You let her go through that , let us all , and none of us ever forgot it or ever will . " Bonny still shook , but it was not from rage any more . It was the same as that afternoon when he had left Buford Bowers and his brother . All the spirit was gone from him , and all at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the park . He cut straight across the fields , behind the big houses on Church St reet , and never even saw anybody on the street . until he came home . He told them there was a fair in Albemarle County he wanted to go to , that he had several horses he believed would make a good trade . When Kirby came home later , the family was stilled . They felt what had happened was for the best , that maybe Bonny would even pay more attention to his harness shop and follow fewer fairs . But it was still a terrible thing to see a big , black-bearded man like Bonny , who had been one of the best scouts in Stuart 's cavalry , defeated by his son and crawling off like an animal to lick his wounds alone . I-FOUR yours later , no one would have recognized the white frame house which Bonny Harron had first glimpsed standing bleakly in a field of weeds . The white was gone in a warm yellow . The dull front wall was broken by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to a wide gallery , supported by Hated columns , with green steps descending to the trick walk of the lawn . New homes Bunked the Harron house on both sides . lining the four blocks of Church Street , which ran brad and straight where the old drive had curved around the park . They were tine houses , too , with carriage blocks in front and iron dogs in their iron-fenced lawns , and one with a handsome deer . But Bonny liked neither the house nor the neighborhood any better than on the day he had come with Kirby to see it . In fact , he never thought of where he lived as a neighborhood , because mine of the people were has neighbors . At the most , he had a speaking acquaintance with them , and with some he did not even exchange a nod . They were all too stiff for turn , too careful , thinking too much ahout how they appeared to the world . He could see them standing in their yards , studying their property and eying their neighbors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were all trying to make a show , the way everybody in Richmond was these days . He used to think Kirby was wrong , working every night on plans for Broughton 's mill or for improving the house . He wanted to change the mill as much as he changed the house , but old Broughton argued with him there . No-body argued with him at home . With Willie Costello working as his bookkeeper , he turned his room into an office . From there , he handled all the moneys co mi ng into the house , through salaries or board or any other way , and he apportioned every penny to he used for house expenses , taxes and mortgage interest and payments , and improvements  --  always improvements . Scarcely a month passed without Kirby conferring with carpenters and painters , figuring to get the best for the least . That had seemed to Bonny a poor way to live , with every move in a man 's life accounted for , but now he reckoned he was the wrong one . The family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't quarrel with that . But he was n't made to fit into any such pattern and he withdrew as quietly as he could . He took to leaving the harness shop more than before , going for ever longer trips to fairs and horse shows . His business had gone ; he knew that , and the others would know it , too , soon enough . But he had to get out of the city , get away from the people who made him uneasy all the time now . The family could not deny that he brought in occasional cash from his horse deals ; even Kirby would admit that . Strange how he had become like a little boy to his son . It did n't hurt him any more  --  not the way it used to . He was a countryman , an old soldier , and he could never have taken care of his family the way Kirby was doing . Kirby was of the city , He understood its way . He liked its scenes and smells and muted rumble , liked its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the city 's life in his way as much as the Bowerses were in theirs , and the family responded to his sureness . He had helped Lee , too , getting him a job with the Pocahontas Transfer Company three years ago and working with him at night on figures , so he would be more valuable . And now , to get a larger revenue into the house , Kirby had built a room on the upstairs back porch , and there he hoarded Uncle Gracchus . Gracchus Harron was Bonny 's older brother , and since the war he had been addicted to American rye whisky . He set more store by it than anything in life . It was because of this and his passion for singing in four voices that Gracchus gut in the riot . No one ever truly understood the riot , except that Gracchus and his companions were coming home from a Sunday-school picnic , Out he appeared at the Harrows ' house suffering from a hip injury caused by a thrown brick . Nobody wanted him to stay except Granny , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his new room , but these two understood each other , and he stayed . He had been there no more than a week and was still in bed when an insurance agent came to collect damages fur Bannon 's saloon , where the riot occurred . Bonny chased the agent away , and he left , threatening them with a company official . The next night just after supper , they heard someone stumbling and muttering out on the front porch . All the men except Gracchus jumped up and hurried into the hall . Reeling against the screen door was a middle-aged man , immaculately dressed and very drunk . He straightened when he saw them , making an obvious effort to compose himself . " Where 's the old scoundrel ' ? " he mumbled . " What do you want here , brother ? " Bonny asked- " I told you  --  that old scoundrel - the saloon-window breaker the " " Are you looking for Gracchus Ha rro on ? " " ? That 's the fellow . My friends told me - friends at Bannon 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The door sailed open and he staggered back , lost his balance and pitched hard to the floor of the porch . He rolled over , muttering , as they reached him . They picked him up and Bonny said , " I think you 'd better go hack to your friends . " " What friends ? I have n't any friends . " His head sagged forward and he lay limp in their arms . The men looked at one another . Willie said , " We ca n't let him go like this . He might be robbed . He 's got a big diamond ring on his finger and a pearl in his tie . Boy I " But he looks like he lived on the West Side . " " I live on West Grace . " He muttered a number . " But I do n't want to go there now . " " Who are you ? " " I 'm Raymond Bland Pendleton , if that means anything to you . " " The insurance man . You know , the one the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't call me ' insurance man . ' I just work there . I do n't like it  --  do n't like the common people there  --  do n't like anything about it . " " I 'll take him home , " Kirby said . " I 'm going uptown tonight anyway . He 's not far from where I 'm going . " " I reckon that 's the best thing . We 'll help you get him to the trolley car . " " Do n't want go home . I 've signed the pledge . Got teetotaler 's badge in my pocket . " " Lee , " Kirby said , " get me my hat . . . . Willie , bring a wet cloth Raymond Bland Pendleton protested while they soaked his face and wrists , rubbed the back of his neck and shook him up in general . When they finished he was able to drag his feet along with his arms draped around the shoulders of Bonny and Lee . They came to the tracks of the new electric streetcar and Mr. Pendleton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ride one of these things . Horsecars all my life . Richmond changing too much anyway . No other city in world has things like this  --  electric cars to rush through streets . Wake the dead . " Then the car came clanging around the corner , On the front platform the motorman turned the shiny brake handle with a flourish and clanged his foot bell . " Awake the dead ! " Mr. Pendleton shouted , and collapsed in their arms . All four men took him on , telling the conductor to hold the car . They set him in the corner , leaning back , his face drawn in pain . He looked as if he had been weeping , but they knew he had n't . The others left him with Kirby . The conductor banged down on his cord and the car lurched ahead . All the way on the long ride to the West Side Mr. Pendleton never stirred . At Madison Street , Kirby lifted him from the car with the conductor 's help . He was a dead weight now . Kirby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the dark side-street block to West Grace . The trees threw soft shadows , and street lights cast little yellow circles in the darkness . Horses ' hoofs sounded a muffled rhythm as a buggy and a carriage passed each other . In the brick houses lights glowed through tall windows . The houses seemed more stately and the street quieter than on East Hill , and Kirby felt the sense of richness , of mellowness , stir in him . Then he found Mr. Pendleton 's house . The narrowest on the block , it was pinched between two handsome houses . He moved quietly toward the porch , intending to place the man on his feet after he mounted the steps . emerged from the porch shadows . Her white dress was a flowing , rustling b But lady as r , he paused to shift him a l There was a quick scent in Kirby 's nostrils and then he saw her face , a dim oval , very pretty , and lips , dark in the night , moving angrily . " Do n't bother to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is ! Just take him to his room ! You know where it is ! " The voice was shrilly pettish , and Kirby straightened against it , still holding the man on his shoulder . " I 'm sorry , ma'am , " he said ; " I 've never been here before . " ( Continued on Page 41 ( Continued from Page 38 ) " Oh , you 're a new one . " She looked more closely , and he saw the light in her helpless , furious eyes . " You 're the kind he takes up with when he goes off from his home . You 're the kind who does n't know who he is and spends his money for him , and then " " I 'm the kind , ma'am , who never saw him before in my life . I 'm the kind who was eating supper with his family when this man came to our door so drunk he could n't stand up . He was there to investigate my uncle for some insurance claim , but he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did n't want to come home , and I do n't blame him . If you 'll show me where to drop him , I 'll be glad to take my leave . " " Why  --  why , you ? " She stepped back from him , and then another lady was at her side , a young one , saying , " I 'm sorry if we mistook you for someone else . If you 'll be kind enough to follow me , I 'll show you where to put him . " Kirby carried Mr. Pendleton into the hall , palely lit from a gaslight in the parlor . Broad stairs rose slowly to the dimness above . The young lady ran ahead of him up the stairs , and Kirby noticed the curve of her body flowing out from her narrow waist . In the upper hall she lit a jet covered by a frosted globe , and she was standing just under it as Kirby turned away from the stairs . She was breathing quickly from her run . A lace collar circled her throat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things Kirby noticed as he moved toward her , feeling her watch him . Her eyes were wide and he saw their light hazel color , like her mother 's , but there was nothing helpless about hers . There was nothing helpless or flustered in her face , either ; though that , too , resembled her mother 's , except the mouth . Her lips were wide and full , parted now , and the sudden desire to kiss her made Kirby forget everything else . It was as if something of his feelings passed to her , for she did not move as he reached her side . She stood looking , not at her father but at Kirby , with her wide light eyes , and time and sound and motion seemed to stop . Kirby realized that all the while Mrs. Pendleton 's frenzied steps had been rushing up the stairs , but he was not aware of having heard them until she called at the head of the stairs , " What are you standing there for with him , young man ? " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Inside , a faint breeze stirred the curtains beside a large double bed , but the room was hot . Kirby laid Mr. Pendleton on the bed . He moaned , rolling over and burying his face on the pillow spread . Mrs. Pendleton panted in , her vagrant scent touching Kirby as she brushed by him . " What are you standing here for ? " she flung at him . " Do you expect pay for bringing him home ? " Kirby turned and walked from the room . Behind him , he heard her voice break , and she sobbed , " Oh , Ray , whatever are we going to come to ? " Then he turned around the head of the stairs and he sensed the girl looking at him . He glanced back . She was hurrying out of the room , her skirts swirling about her ankles , her lips still parted as they had been when she stood under the light . He paused there until she reached him . " I 'm sorry , " she said . " Wo n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd like to talk to you . " They went downstairs together , without speaking . Her nearness hurt him in some curious , muffled way , like nothing he had ever known . It was a straining , eager and unfocused , shaking all the sureness he lived by . They moved into the parlor , where both paused , uncertain , half turning to each other . Then she said , " You must be awfully hot . Would n't you like some water or  --  or lemonade ? We have some all made . " " I would like some , thank you . " The room seemed strange to him while she was gone , where before he had not noticed it at all . It seemed cluttered with oddments of furniture and ornaments , and in a big gilt oval frame over the mantelpiece was the colored picture of an older man whose face looked vaguely familiar . It was a large face , strong and coarse , with a tight mouth and eyes like those of a gang boss . Then Kirby forgot him as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a silver waiter . They sat opposite each other in wing chairs near the window . They sipped the lemonade , and Kirby , his brain glazed , could only say , " This is fine . " She smiled then , suddenly , with young humor lighting her face . " I do n't even know your name . What is it ? " " Kirby Harrorn " " Mine 's Nancy Pendleton " ? and the smile faded . " You knew my father 's ? " " Not before tonight . Like I told your mother " " I know . I heard you . You see , mother gets all upset when he goes out and does that . " " It 's all right . " " But I want you to know she did n't mean what she said . She does n't even know when he 's like that . My father should never drink . He ca n't carry it like other men . And he does n't drink now , unless somebody leads him astray , and my mother thought you must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understood that . " " But I do want to thank you for bringing him home . It was from East Hill , was n't it ? " Kirby nodded . " I remember he said at breakfast . he might have to go there about a claim . " " My uncle . He was in a riot . " " Oh , I read about it in the papers . It must 've been terrible . " " He was the only one badly hurt , but your father 's company is trying to collect from him because they 've got to pay the saloon that was all smashed up . Uncle Gracchus was just passing by when the people from the saloon jumped on him . He was singing and they did n't like it , I reckon . " He smiled a little , for the first time . She forced an answering smile , and it was very sweet . " He should n't have to pay anything for singing . I 'll tell father tomorrow , and I 'm sure everything will be all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'd like to , though . " She had finished the lemonade and set the glass on the table . There did n't seem any more to say . Kirby finished his lemonade . He did n't know whether to hold the empty glass or set it on the table . She settled it for him . " Wo n't you have some more , Mr. Harron ? " A politeness colored her voice and he sensed that the answer should he " no . " He arose . " Thank you very much , but I reckon I 'll have to be moseying along . " She arose , too , and held out her hand . " It certainly was nice of you , and I know mother will want to thank you herself . " Courteous phrases fumbled around in his brain . Suddenly he shook them all out , said steadily , " I 'm glad I had the opportunity of meeting you , Miss Pendleton . I hope I can see you again . " Her light hazel eyes stared straight into his . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T HE letter from Mrs. Pendleton , written with delicate precision , was on a heavy huff paper . After he read it , Kirby automatically held the sheet to the light . It was cloudy and streaked , with short fibers - a poor paper , pretentious , and designed to sell in fancy boxes with a slice of ribbon across the top . Fingering the sheet , Kirby remembered that the wallpaper in their living room had been faded . He was in the room he shared with Lee . In a corner of the wide drawer in the bureau he kept a box of note paper , samples of the finest run of bond the mill ever had turned out . Rag and sulphite-pulp base , the sheet was clear and even , with the watermark , Broughton Bond , standing out with grace and authority . Kirby felt sad about that paper . Mr. Broughton , who had set great store by it , lost money on the experiment and the whole project of bond papers had been abandoned . Mr. Broughton seemed to have lost his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the clerical work of the mill but much of the buying himself , and nearly always wrote out the orders for a paper run . Frequently , of late , he worked out the furnish for the beaters with Mr. Broughton , and sometimes he even handled a run from the order to the finishing room by himself . In spite of all the added time this gave Mr. Broughton on the street , he gained no new business and barely held his own . At the mill itself , he seemed uncertain what to try next , as with the Broughton Bond , which he made when he should n't and which he abandoned when he should have kept on , just as it was beginning to sell . The trouble was he made every kind of paper under the sun , from newsprint to Manila wrapping , with every grade of book paper between , when he should have concentrated on a few . From Kirby 's own figures on beater time and machin.e run , he pointed out the enormous waste of so many changes in stork @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble to do the figuring at home , at . night , and when he told Mr. Broughton , the old gentleman had answered him very stiffly . " You 've become a very smart young man on handling figures , " he said , " and please remain in that province . I handle the mill . " Kirby bad been so angry he did n't answer at all , and for several days only the coldest courtesies passed between them . Then Mr. Broughton came to him and apologized for speaking so sharply . " It 's a poor man who could not accept criticism , " he said , " especially when it was offered with the interest of the mill at heart . But I would like to point out that my experience counts for something . " It counted for being scared to follow through with a paper they all believed in , for being eager to turn the whole mill upside down to make a few reams for some sure sale to a jobber . Kirby did n't say that . He realized that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then on he learned how to advance his ideas so Mr. Broughton would listen . He was hard to change , and sometimes lately , as Kirby grew surer and the old man more uncertain , their arguments became bitter . But nothing would induce him to try the Broughton Bond again . Well , this was not the time to think of new arguments to try . He took several sheets of the paper and went downstairs . It was no use to think of Mr. Broughton now . In the living room , Kirby noticed his mother in the low glow of the lamp , where she was reading . That was the way in which he had seen the girl , only a few nights before , and suddenly he was grieved for his mother because of the difference in the two women . So short a time ago as his own life span , when she had borne him , Emily Bowers Harron must have looked as fresh and young as Nancy Pendleton had looked with her parted lips . Now tired lines streaked the softness that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing her always here , always unnerved by their violence of sound and movement , that her early years had been lived in a gentler world . The Bowerses were soft , as she was , but also hard , as she was not , and maybe that was because they had remained in their own world , where they were sure . He remembered glimpses of them in their carriages , their faces calm and their eyes cool , and everything about them in order . But she had been uprooted from her own world , and Kirby saw all her life on her tired face now , all the confused and broken memories haunting her eyes . Then she said , " What is it . Kirby ? I 'm reading a new novel and I want to llnish it before I go to bed . I 've had a hard day . " " Yes 'm , " he said , and remembered what he wanted . " uh . I want to write to Miss Pendleton , asking to see her , but her mother has written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one I should write to . " " Write to them both , son . " Her eyes brightened and her voice quickened . " Acknowledge Mrs. Pendleton 's apology and tell her you hope to have the honor of addressing her daughter . Then write to Miss Pendleton and ask may you call upon her at such and such a time . I wonder if that Mr. Pendleton who came here was Ray Pendleton . " " That 's who it was , mamma . " " I declare , " She smiled very softly . " He used to be a beau in Richmond when I was a girl . You tell him that you are Emily Bowers ' son . " " I will . What kind of a fellow was he ? " " Do n't say ' fellow , ' son . " " Gentleman . " " Oh , he came of country people like ourselves , only he had moved to Richmond before the war . I do n't think they ever amounted to much , but they were very proud of their name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she laughed a little ? " he did give the most foolish compliments . " " I think they are still very proud of something . " " Well , that 's just . their way . They have no more to be proud of than you have . But they love to make a show , and you 'd better he careful if you want to escort Ray Pendleton 's daughter , if she 's anything like he was . She 'll want ti do things up in fine style . " " I do n't see how I can get any more money . Mr. Broughton said that the seventy-five I 'm getting now is all I can hope fur , and I know that 's true , because the mill 's not doing so good . That 's only what . old man Cary got though . " " I would n't cross the bridge until you come to it . Maybe she 's not like her father . You go on and write your letters now . " Kirby went slowly upstairs to his room . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was talking to himself . Kirby lit the handy-man lamp and sat down to compose his letter to Nancy Pendleton , VII HE heat wave had broken on the 1 night Kirby called on Nancy Pendleton . Though the days continued hot , in the evenings a faint breeze lightened the air . Sitting with the Pendletons on their front porch , smelling the lush dusk and hearing voices drone on other porches , Kirby remembered that dusk on Jefferson Street when Phil Edwards was killed in front of his house while Annie Gooch jumped up screaming next door . That neighborhood seemed far from this mellow block . Here the lonely , muffled yellow of the street lamp did not lift the darkness of the yards , separate and withdrawn . Vines , bordering the iron grill work of the porches , shut each family off from its neighbor in a deep and secret shadow . It was what he had tried to tell Leslie Gooch the night they had argued in the park , only he had not understood it clearly then . Now he knew the shooting could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not happen to everybody on the block . All the neighbors would not be drawn in together like one family ; each person would not suffer the shock of Annie Gooch seeing her lover killed , and feel the shame . Yet . the Pendletons did not seem to belong to their neighborhood as surely as his family belonged to theirs , even on Church Street , and Kirby could not have said why he sensed that . Part of it perhaps came from the way they were treating him . He had not been there ten minutes before he knew they had not wanted him to come . They were just being polite because of the night he had brought Mr. Pendleton home . Ray Pendleton was going out of his way to show Kirby that he was not the man he had appeared to be when he had a load on . Tonight he acted the great gentleman . He did have real breeding in his face , and you could see he had lived elegantly , but he was putting on airs too . Mrs. Pendleton was more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice she talked around him , mentioning names and events unfamiliar to him , and then pretending she had forgotten he would n't know . She thought he knew nothing , and she was one of the West Siders who thought nobody on East Hill could be very nice anyway . When she mentioned Doctor Brandon , and Kirby said the Brandons lived near them on Church Street , Mrs. Pendleton cried , " Oh , do they still live over there ? " " Yes , ma'am , " he said in a low voice . Resentment boiled up in him . He glanced toward Nancy , sitting silently near the porch rail . Her face was expressionless and he could not tell whether she was looking at him or not . All evening she had spoken little , and that impersonal ? part of the aimless talk that skirted around him . Nothing of the mood between them the other night was even suggested by her now . Distant and removed , she was one of the family , dutifully receiving a necessary guest and waiting for him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . Then he recalled that his mother had always told him , " Do n't squirm like a worm in a hot skillet , so 's everybody can see you are uncomfortable . " He forced himself to remain rigid , and then he remembered his mother 's words about Ray Pendleton . Staring straight ahead , he said , " Mr. Pendleton , my mother asked me to give you her regards . She was Emily Bowers before she married . " " Emily Bowers ! " he exclaimed , and it was a different voice . Kirby heard Mrs. Pendleton stop her untidy rocking and the smell of her perfume reached him as she turned suddenly . Then Ray Pendleton went on , " I have n't seen Miss Emily , I reckon  --  why , I reckon it 's since the war . She used to visit her brother Buford in town , just before the war , and  --  and It was to her home I went the  --  the other night ? " " Yes , sir . " " But I know your Aunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " that is , your Uncle Walter 's wife . " " Yes 'm . " Hating himself , he kept silent about his feelings for the Bowerses . " Your mother knew her in the old days , did n't she , Mr. Harron ? " " Not well . " " No , " Ray Pendleton said , " the Bowerses were country people , like myself . Country people used to stay in the country then . Many 's the good time I 've had at Miss Emily 's house . That was a beautiful place of your grandfather 's . " Mrs. Pendleton , now almost anxiously sweet , asked , " Is it still in the family , Mr. Herron ? " " The Bowerses still own it . " " I would have mine , " Ray Pendleton said , " if I had n't been a smart aleck . I came to Richmond two years before the war to make my fortune . I never could go back to the country after the war , even though everything was changed here . I recollect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up Main Street and seeing everything in ruins . I knew then that all the old life was gone , and I should have left with it . The only people who should have stayed were those who were glad the old city was wiped out , because they could make the new city . " " Now , Ray , " Mrs. Pendleton interrupted , " Mr. Harron wo n't come back if you belabor him with your stories about changing times . I reckon he hears enough of that at home , and ? " Her words drifted on , but Kirby 's attention halted at the " come hack . " That was what it meant on the West Side to have Dr. Buford Bowers for an uncle , even if you had n't been near enough to speak for years . Until then Mrs. Pendleton had been trying to discourage him from returning , and now  --  now the evening was suddenly in his hands . He glanced again at Nancy , who had not uttered a sound during all this talk . Her face was partly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth . He had to see her away from her parents , he had to know . Kirby stood up abruptly and asked if he might take Nancy to the confectioner 's for some ice cream . His words hovered in the soft evening and he heard them over , loud and blurting . He saw Nancy look up at him , unmoving ; her face a white mask with a dark , full mouth . He bowed toward her , toned his voice down . " That is , " he said , " if you 'd care to . " " Thank you . I think that would be very nice . " Her voice was as impersonal as it had been all evening , Descending the steep steps , he held her arm , wondering if he should . She walked as if he were not touching her . At the fence , he was relieved to release her as he held open the gate . Past the yellow glow of the street lamp , they walked in darkness , but he could see the outlines of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding her body straight . Not many women moved with her freeness , and there was something eager in her walk too . He remembered the strained eagerness in her face the night she had stood under the hall light , and the memory of what he had felt then returned painfully to him . They reached the corner . Down the side street they saw the light from Cabell and Chelf 's drugstore lapping out on the brick sidewalk . Young laughter ran from the store , fading into the street heat of the evening . In there he knew he could not talk as he must , so he said , " Look . Would you mind walking a little before we go in ( Continued on Page 44 ) ( Continued from Page 42 ) there ? I want to talk to you about something . " She glanced up at him , her face still expressionless , but with appraisal in her eyes . " All right , " she said indifferently . Against her manner he would never think of the way to start , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about coming back . Well , I would n't come back to see her or your father , but you . What I wanted to ask you was  --  was : Do you want me to ? " He heard her light laugh , a little unsure , and then , " Why , naturally , you 're always welcome . " " 1 know  --  I mean I appreciate that . But do you really want to see me ? " " I must say you 're a very strange young man . You do n't believe in bandying words , do you ? " Knowing her laughter was at him , knowing he was helpless against it , he blundered on . " I do n't know how to and , besides , what 's the use ? I know I want to see you a lot , but I wo n't come if you do n't want to see me . " " As I said , you 'll always be welcome . I do n't know what else you want me to say . " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , you said you heard my mother ask you to come back and " " After she knew I was kin to the Bowerses . " His anger possessing him , he added , " Before that she was just waiting for me to leave . " " I think you 're taking a lot for granted , " she said coldly . " I 'm taking what happened to me . Do you think I have n't got any feel-ings ? " " You talk like I have n't any , saying such things about my mother . " " Well , they 're true . " " If you think that , I do n't see why you want to come back , " " Because " ? and he heard his voice rising , held it down ? " I want to see you . " " Well ? " The same light indifference colored her voice . " All right , " he interrupted . " Maybe I 've talked in the wrong way , but , you see , I do n't know much about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - " " You certainly are n't going about it in a way to find out . " He did n't answer that . His anger at her merged with his resentment of her mother , his contempt for her family , and all of it was stirred up by his defensiveness , Her very nearness goaded him now . He heard his hardened voice lashing out , and he could n't stop it . " You see , over on East Hill wher : I live , boys do n't have time to learn things except by asking . We do n't go to dancing schools ; we go to work . And nobody there is anxious to help us either . I 've learned . everything I know by asking and listening , and I reckon I 've found out what I want to know here . " When Nancy said nothing , he asked in the same tone , " Would you care to have some ice cream now ? " " No , thank you ; I do n't think so . I think I 'd better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her porch , Kirby walked fast and unseeing , knowing only a numbed fury that drov him , like a goad , all the way up Church Street Hill and on to the park . At his house , all the lights were out except in the room he shared with his brother . There Lee was stretched out on the bed , his feet propped up on the end post , practicing smoking a cigarette . " What the hell you doing that for ? " Kirby asked . " The boys at the transfer company do it and it 's cheaper than cigars , cheaper even than Willie 's cheroots , and I do n't like chewing tobacco . " " You got to smoke something ? " " Ai n't no harm in it . Sure wo n't stunt my growth . " He laughed . Kirby did n't answer . He slammed his shoes to the floor and , standing up , started untying his tie . Lee rolled a little to get a better look at his brother . " Say , what 's the matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with that girl you seen ? " " Saw ! No , I did n't . Her family treated me like I was a dog until they knew we were kin to the Bowerses , and then butter would n't melt in their mouths . I do n't want anybody to be nice to me because I 'm kin to them . What 's the matter with me ? " He threw his tie on the dresser and ripped the limp collar off his neckband . " We 've got a nice home and do n't owe anybody a cent . I 've got a good job , better than his , and we 're just as good as his people . Mamma said so . " " Gee , Kirby , you sound like that night you argued with Leslie Gooch on the park . " " I feel like it , too ; only I knew what to do then . " He started pulling off his shirt . Lee put out his cigarette , serious now . " You ought to get more money at the mill . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , but Mr. Broughton ca n't afford it . He 's taught me everything I know about paper and that 's the only way he can pay me . " Gee " ? Lee was all sympathy " you ought to be able to do something . " Kirby looked at Lee . Suddenly he stood very still . " I 'll tell you one thing I can do . I can put you in the shipping room . You 'll be assistant shipping clerk . There 's a fellow in there I do n't like anyway , and I 'll get Mr. Broughton to fire him . " " But I ca n't figure well enough . " " I 'll teach you . I learned it myself , and so can you . " " But , Kirby " ? Lee struggled to his feet ? " I like it at the transfer company . " " You do n't work because you like it . You work to get somewhere . You think I want my brother to be a day laborer ? You start Monday . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Nancy Pendleton . It was on the hall table when he got home from work . He knew he had been waiting for it when he ripped the envelope open . Dear Mr. Harrcrif : Our girls ' club is giving a moonlight this Thursday and I will be very glad it you would be my escort upon that occasion . We leave at five o'clock , so we can go all the way to Gamble 's Hundred Plantation . Will you please let me know if this will suit your convenience ? Sincerely yours , NANCY PENDLETON . Kirby walked slowly up to his room . Before supper he wrote the acceptance , polite and formal and not at all anxious . But he thought of nothing else until he met her at the wharf and joined the large group of strangers moving up the gangplank . In the excitement , Nancy seemed just another of the strangers , introducing him here and there ; she one of them , and he the outsider as always , When the river boat swayed sluggishly away from the dock and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , staring at the outline of the old city . He watched the seven hills assume form and shape against the sky , watched the pillared white capitol that had been the symbol to his people defending their capital against invasion . Then the city had belonged to them as much as to anybody . Now he , alone among all these young Richmonders , felt disinherited ; that his people 's share had not come down to him . When they were all herded by the chaperons down into the white-painted saloon and he began to catch the names of the others , Kirby knew he was among those who had inherited the city . These were the sons and daughters of families whose names he read in the newspapers and on the new buildings - bankers and real-estate men and brokers , commission merchants and jobbers , manufacturers in iron and wood and flour , railroad operators and tobacco men from every branch of the business . The old names were not many among these bright young West Siders . Their names belonged to the builders of the new city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't know who he was . His name meant nothing . But taking no chances , they were pleasant enough . and not one was dressed better than he . Kirby had a new suit , double-breasted , with high-cut coat and silk-li ned lapels . He was wearing a stand-up collar with his blue silk cravat , tied in a large loose knot with a pearl tiepin in it . His mother had given it to him for Christmas , telling him at the same time to avoid such imitation diamonds as the crescent worn by Willie Costello . At first he had felt terribly stiff , trying to stand and sit naturally , to answer pleasantly and laugh with the others , even when nothing seemed funny . The low-ceilinged saloon was hot and the monotonous motion of the boat made him restive . Then he sensed that Nancy did not belong wholly with them either . He could n't say how , but she was like her house on West Grace . It was in the block , and all right , but there was a difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at ease , hut , he liked the moonlight ride even less . The jokes seemed silly , the talk inane , arid the men affected . He tried to remain close to Nancy in the aimless milling around . He wanted to be alone with her . But the whole party had divided into groups , each under a sentinel-like chaperon , and the loud music of the orchestrion incited them to gayer cavorting . Finally , Kirby slipped out of the saloon , moved up the steps to the deck . Except for faint boat lamps , the only light was moonglow . He leaned on the rail , staring at the shore line . He knew he should n't leave the party , but he had to be alone a little while . Those people were too strange for him . He watched the outlines of an old plantation house take form against the sky . Almost immediately the boat began threshing water as it turned ponderously in the river . With the change in movement came a rush of voices up the companionway . Kirby stepped back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , singing , " Richmond girls , wo n't you come out tonight and dance by the light of the moon . " Relieved that he would n't have to re-enter the saloon alone , he moved toward the stream spilling out of the doorway . Before he joined them , Nancy stepped through . She was laughing gaily when she saw him . She paused , her eyes widening in an unguarded moment , like on the night she had watched him move toward her in the hall . Then , without a word to those around her , she moved straight to him . " I did n't know where you were , " she said , not at all reproving ; rather , anxious . " It got too hot for me . I-1 was just going to cool off a minute . " " Oh . I was afraid you were n't having a good time . " She glanced toward the rail . Couples had strung out almost to the end . " Let 's go duwn to the far end . " Then , almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off with their escorts . " " Do we stop here ? " " Just slow for the boat to turn and let everybody look at Gamble 's Hundred . See ! The searchlight is going on it now . " The thin pallid light sprayed over second-growth pines , marching down to the shore . Near Nancy a chaperon was telling several couples about the famous plantation , . . and that was all rye and wheat , acre after acre ; my father remembers seeing it when he was a tittle boy . Back on the highland were hundreds of acres of tobacco , and there "  - -  the light wavered on a marshy point of land , jutting out into the river , with cypress trees bordering its hanks --  " they say the first lady of Gamble 's Hundred used to stand every afternoon , rain or shine , and stare westward up the river . She had had an unhappy love affair , so the story goes , and her sweetheart had gone to the frontier . She grieved herself away and died of a broken heart . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's buried in the garden yonder . " The light moved along the vine-covered wall , then over a vast lawn sloping to the river , and rested on t he house itself . " You should know about Gamble 's Hundred , Mr. Herron , " Nancy said . Your Aunt Catherine Bowers was born there . " " She 's no aunt of mine , " he answered bluntly , then added , " I hardly know her . " " Yes , I knew that the other night . " He turned sharply toward her . At that moment the searchlight gave a flourish over the river and went off . The boat had completed its turn . The chaperon gathered her pink eiderdown wrap about her shoulders with a shepherding movement , starting the couples to the saloon for refreshments . " Do we have to go hack with them ? " Kirby asked . Nancy , studying him and then glancing over his shoulder , shook her head . " I do n't reckon they 'd mind for a little while , It 's right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bowerses and me ? " " I did n't know it until you 'd gone and I got to thinking over things you said . Then I knew you would n't feel about things the way you did unless there was something wrong like that something that had made you very sensitive . My mother has treated many boys like that , and worse , and they never felt the way you did . " " I was right , though , was n't I ? " " Yes , " she said , very low , " you were . My mother had been complaining about your coming all afternoon , but do n't think it 's just you she picked on . She 's like that about a lot of people  --  people she does n't even know . You see , we 've got two sides in our family too . That 's how I guessed about you . " You mean your mother is cut off from her own people ? " " Not cut off exactly , but there 's a strain . My mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people who own the Model Paper Company ? " " That and other things , and the insurance company where my father works . He does n't like them and they do n't like him , but he , having to work for them and all , and then sometimes doing things like the other night  --  well , they stay away from each other all they can to keep from arguing , but it seems like something is always corning up anyway , and my mother does n't know which side to be on , and - and " She checked herself , glanc-ing up at him . He had been watching her , and their glances held , like that first night under the hall light . Suddenly Kirby felt a communication between them such as he had never known with a living soul . He knew he could tell her anything , and she him , and that was why she revealed these things about her family , even before either of them realized the response between them . He was anxious to let her knew that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " It 's much more than that in my family . The Bowerses wanted to run my father 's life , like the Measles did yours ; only my father would n't have anything to do with them . They parted hating one another , and for years they have n't spoken . Things did n't go so well with my father , and that made it worse for us . " " Not for your mother , though , " Nancy said . " It would 've been better if my father had stood up to the Meades , but they had ? had things he wanted . " " The Bowerses had things the rest of us wanted , too , though my mother never said so , and that 's what I 've tried to give them . I just could n't hear it that anybody could ever look down on them . " " That 's why I guessed about you , because von felt it so deeply , and because you did n't just feel it , you wanted to do something about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treated you. - " oh , that 's all right . I do n't blame you , me being so mad and all . ' ' ' ' But 1 was mad tiro . I wanted to spite my mother for asking you hack just because you mentioned the Bowerses , and then you hurt me by knowing what she had done . / really did n't want you ever to come back again then . " " I never thought I 'd hear from you again . " " You would n't have tried to see me again , would you ? " Kirby was embarrassed . " I do n't know , " he answered in it low voice . She laughed a little , unsure , and Kirby said , " But I certainly am glad I did see you . " " I 'm glad too . You see , something you said the other night , that I thought over afterwards when I was n't cross any more , made me know that you 're lonely too . " " Are you lonely ? " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the saloon . " I know what you 're thinking  --  about boys -- hut they do n't keep me from being lonely . They do n't have things at home like I do . They all have everything right . They do n't have things to make them feel different from other people , like like " Like we do , " Kirby said suddenly , " Yes , " she said it breathlessly , unthinking , and then caught herself . Already the sharing between them had ( Continued on Page 48 ) ( Continued from Page 45 ) happened , and the knowing of it , and they were held together by it . Nancy looked up at him , hushed , almost I rightened , and Kirby felt his life sway toward her . He made no move , nor did she , but they had touched , held each other for that moment with something inside them . Nancy moved back from the rail . " 1 reckon we 'll have to go back in now . " " But when can I see you again ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that stirred him , Nancy said , " When do you want to ? " DC F ROM that night on . Kirby no longer felt that he walked alone on earth . He did not have to spend odd evenings in the bar of Ford 's Hotel , listening to men and learning , nor the other nights at home , figuring and figuring on ways to improve the house . They seemed happier at home , too , since there were no more changes . As summer wore into fall he liked to see his family sitting around the dining-room table , talking and laughing , and when friends or kinspeople dropped in , the men would fight over the war and the women would discuss new styles and preserving and fall cleaning , and later his mother would serve hot chocolate and ladyfingers . The evenings when Kirhy saw Nancy he told her about his life at home , told her about everything . It was as if he could not tell her enough of all he had stored up since he used to talk to Leslie Gooch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had ever confided his plans for the mill , his own hopes there , and his struggles with Mr. Broughton . It seemed that the less sure the old man became in handling the problems of the mill , the more testy he became , the more he resisted any change , only the other day Kirby had given him figures showing that the wastepaper sorters spent three hours longer than they should on every consignment of wastepaper they bought from Hicks , because the papers contained too much ground-wood pulp . Instead of wanting to save those extra three hours , at fifteen cents an hour , Mr. Broughton had grown angrier than Kirby had ever seen him . I 've bought wastepaper from Frank Hicks ever since I 've been in business , and I 'll continue to so do as long as this is my mill . And I wish you 'd remember , young man , that it is still my mill , even though you seem to think you run it . " Kirby told Nancy he had got so mad he had shouted at Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All right , " he said , " from here on , you run it , and I 'll do just the work that I 'm paid to do -- a mill clerk 's . I 'll spend my own time on myself from now on . " Nancy was troubled , and suggested that Mr. Broughton might not want him there at all if he upset the old man - like that . " I was willing to leave , I was so mad myself , " Kirby told her . " But two days later he came to me and said , ' Kirby , you know I could n't run the mill without you . Why , I 've depended on you for five years . But I 'm not myself lately . I do n't seem able to cope with the changes any more , and sometimes it just looks like you are the change itself . I know I need it , though , in my sane moments , when pride is not uppermost . I ca n't run a small business the way I used to  --  not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as elsewhere . But I 'll keep trying and I 'll try to co-operate with you . If I accept your help , perhaps we 'll earn enough more so that your salary can be commensurate with your duties . ' " Nancy liked his telling her those details of his work . They were hound up in his dreams and they gave Nancy and Kirby a wonderful sense of sharing . She told him about herself too . They had gone on from the night on the moonlight ride , continuing each time where they had left off before , and the time was never long enough to finish . Through the weeks , she slowly revealed the life in her home that made her different from all those young West Siders Kirby had met on the boat . Mrs. Pendleton was a country girl from Hanover County . Her father , Wash Meade , had been a peddler before the war , selling to the plantation houses . During the war he had worked in the quartermaster department in Richmond . There he used his peddler 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duke , a wartime speculator . After the war , he stayed in the half-ruined city and went into the construction business . While other men gathered in forlorn groups , talking over their losses and the wreckage of the city , and while still others proudly worked at menial jobs , Wash cultivated the carpetbaggers and the officers of the army of occupation . He had cash and vigor , a shrewd sense of trading in material and men , and no scruples . Wash could scarcely write his own name , but , he could carry figures in his head and he was one of the builders of the new city . His oldest son , Vincent , started with him , and a year later Wash brought his daughter and her two other brothers to Richmond . The boys occupied themselves from the first . Vincent grew up with the newly organized Model Paper Company , in which the old man bought controlling interest Charlie was put in the Tidewater Bank , and Bob in the insurance company . But Phyllis had nothing to do . The city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fresh buildings . Downtown , the wrecked streets were cluttered with crippled and broken men , ex-soldiers reliving the war and the days before . Uptown , the nice people lived behind closed shutters . Phyllis Meade was sixteen and pretty , fresh from the country , and she lived in the strange city among desolation and harsh growth for over a year before she met a young man . He was Ray Pendleton. a clerk in the new insurance company , and he was the handsomest and most elegant gentleman she had ever seen . He knew the city in the gay days before the siege , and he had furloughed here in the great days of the war , before Gettysburg , when it was a world capital and all the fine homes were thrown open to officers of the First Virginia Regiment . The glory of the lost days was still on him , and he was a gallant beau in his own right , for all that he was as poor as Job 's turkey hen . Phyllis was flattered . She pictured all those old families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while her busy brothers got nowhere with all their grubbing . She was swept off her feet and , in 1868 , they were married , From the beginning , Ray tried to live like the rich Meades , and joined the new Chesterfield Club , with Vincent and Charlie . It was all exciting until , when Nancy was born a year later , Phyllis discovered that Ray not only lacked the money for the doctor 's bills but that they were heavily in debt . Then her father , Wash Meade , came to their rescue , and that formed the pattern of their lives . They always lived extravagantly , Ray drank too much , they were always in debt , and her father always paid them out . That went on until Wash died , three years ago . When his will was read , he had left to each of his sons all his stock in the companies where they were officers , and to his daughter a clearance of Ray 's debts . They amounted to more than twenty thousand dollars . He said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " In addition , his construction company , which had started him , was to be sold . This was to pay all the expenses of his estate , and the residue to be divided equally among the four children . The fourth amounted to fifteen thousand dollars . Ray hailed this as his deliverance from the Meades . " I 'm my own master , " he told his family . " Now we can live like gentlepeople without explaining to them about it , or arguing over everything I do . " He took an office on Main Street and set himself up as an independent insurance broker . He rented a house on West Franklin , furnished it in lavish style on credit , and entertained in the same way . At first he did fine . Soon he was back in his old ways , and drinking heavily . Then after two years , the fifteen thousand dollars was all gone and Ray 's business not worth a shinplaster . Phyllis went to her brother Vincent , the head of the family . and to Bob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ray a position there again . They were stony and both impressed upon her that they were helping only because she was their sister . As for him , it was up to her to hold him in line . They gave up their fine home on West Franklin , and with it most of the elegant furniture which they had never paid for . Both as a decoration and as a gesture of surrender , Ray allowed the picture of his dead father-in-law to hang over the mantel in the West Grace house . It was the only thing Vincent had given them since they were married and it was the coarse old man , with the eyes of a gang boss , whom Kirby had noticed in the cluttered parlor that first night he went there . Nancy had told him all this easily enough , with little feeling and no bitterness . Like himself , it seemed a relief for her to talk , and she confided in him that she had never told another soul about all this . Then one night in late October , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Kirby saw that at once , and for the first time she came into his arms . It was more like a little girl coming to her father , and Kirby held her as though she were that little girl . In the silence he heard her father and mother upstairs . R ay Pendleton was mumbling thickly and Mites Pendleton was trying to quiet him , sounding all undone herself . It was not the helplessness of that first night when Kirby brought him home . She was scared , but she was angry , and her voice came harsh and mean , " Oh , Kirby , " Nancy her an awkward pat , not knowing what to say . Scarcely aware of Mr. and Mrs. Pendleton and the shame they brought on Nancy , he felt a completion of his own in her turning to him , and an invincible strength for the caring of her . " Uncle Bob brought him home . " Nancy raised her voice to drown out the louder words upstairs . " He said this was the last time . Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And he does n't seem to care . He has turned on everything and  --  and everybody . " Kirby held her the closer , wanting to enclose her with the limitless power he felt . Then her father 's voice rang out in a wild cry , " It 's you and your whole family who 've brought me to this ! Money , money , that 's all they understand ! And they ruined me for understanding anything else ! " Mrs. Pendleton struck back at him . They could n't hear her words , but he shouted the louder , his hysterical voice ringing through the house , " You 're just like them  --  that 's the trouble ! You wanted things , always things , from the day we were married ! You wanted things to make you accepted by Richmond people ! Hell 's lire and corruption , nothing would make Richmond people accept anybody as common as your family ! " They heard her voice rising shrilly , " Nothing could be any commoner than you are now ! You fourfiusher with your airs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me out of here ! " Holding his arm around her , he led her through the hall . She took a wrap off the hall rack and he drew it about her . She was trembling . Outside , a damp wind moved slothfully . The thinned trees laid hard shadows over the sidewalk . Nancy paused at the head of the steps and said , " You remember that first night you wanted us to walk , even though it was as hot as could be ? You wanted to talk then . I want to talk now , Kirby . Will you walk with me ? " They walked slowly , turning into West Franklin . They passed the big new houses of tobaccomen and bankers , and the gray stone home of Walter Bowers . Kirby did not think of him now . Nancy clung to his arm , saying nothing . The only sound was the muffled cloppety-clop of a trotting horse on another street . They reached Monroe Park , where they had turned back the first night . Now they crossed the tracks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their feet . rustling the fallen leaves . In the deepest shadow , Nancy stopped and turned to him . Her face was pale in the night light , but he could see clearly the strained intensity . " There does n't seem much I can say , now that I 'm with you . I was so upset before you came . I felt I just had to tell you , but I reckon you already know . " " 1 know how things are with your family , all right , and I know how that can make you feel . " " Yes , only it 's more than that . " " Could it he that ? that you want me to feel them with you ? " Her light eyes opened wider . " Could it ? " " Because I do . " " You do , do n't you ? Maybe that 's why I felt better when you came . " She drew hack a little from his arms , and he held her there . He said , " Nancy , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I sort of felt that you belonged there . I mean , coming to me in time of trouble . And I felt strong , like I could look after you better than anybody , no matter what happened . " The wind blew colder . She shivered and moved back between his arms . " You know , Kirby , I felt that in you . I felt you were strong like that , but  --  but I do n't want to depend on anybody . " " But that 's what I 'm for . " " You 've had enough of that with your own family . " " That just taught me how . " " Maybe all of us should learn that . Maybe there 's something in me that makes me have to too . Maybe I have to know I can be independent of everybody if I have to  --  not like my mother , dependent on my father . " Kirby took a deep breath . " Nancy ! That 's to think that every husband will he like your father . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I am . " " No ! No , do n't say that now . " " But now 's the time . Do n't you think I 've thought of it all these nights when I 've been near you ? ' " Please do n't , Kirby . I know you 've been lonely and all " Look . It wasn't. lonely for people . I know lots of people . I was lonely for somebody I needed . Nancy , I need you . I knew it the first night . " " Kirby , you need somebody less than any man I 've ever known . " " You think that because I 've had to make myself act that way . I did n't have time to waste , fooling around like those fellows on the moonlight , and I never wanted to fool around anyway . I wanted somebody who would be everyi hing to me , and I could wait until I found that person . I could wait because I was used to waiting and doing without . That does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crazy sometimes thinking about it . but I always knew I would rather be lonely than not have the one I wanted . And you 're that one , Nancy . You 're the one I waited for , the one I know I need . With you I:would n't want anything else in life . It would be everything . It would he like a dream . Ca n't you understand what I 'm say-ing ? " " Oh , Kirby , if that were only true ! " " You think I 'm lying ? " " No , no . Only it seems too good to be true . " " But I 've always loved you . " " Oh , darling , I thought you 'd never say it . " Kirby straightened away from her , staring . He saw her lips parted as on the first night , when he had wanted to kiss her more than he had ever wanted to do anything , and he saw that the eagerness in her face now was no longer strained and driven . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands . Her lips pressed to his , she yielded up all the years of her loneliness and all that had ever driven her . They were his now , to hold as he held her , to keep and cherish all his enduring days . He knew that and he knew he would , as he knew that all he had worked for was to be used in taking this girl as his . She stepped back , her quickening breath the only sound in his world . " Kirby , Kirby , I love you so ! " Then he saw that she was frightened . Kirby was scared himself . He clung to her with hands turned stiff . That was the moment when he knew his life would never be the same again . All his simple days were lost , already running out beneath his feet . The Pendletons and the Harrons , the Meades and the Bowersea , old homes and new homes , all would he gathered in a new stream of time , rushing together , sweeping him along with this woman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ton if he could marry Nancy , he bought two cigars at Broughton 's tobacconist , planning to offer one to Ray Pendleton before he began his speech. , i All the way uptown on the electric car , he rehearsed the speech over in his mind . It was hard to concentrate in the crowded trolley , with people laughing as they swayed on the side seats , and calling to the motorman to keep the dour closed . Every time a passenger got off or on , the high wind funneled through the narrow car . When Kirby left the trolley , he felt more nervous than he had since the time he had asked Mr. Broughton for the job in the office . At the house he longed to pause in the vestibule to adjust his cravat and arrange his thoughts , but he strode straight to the door and rapped the knocker loud . The dour was slow in opening , Through the fanlight , he saw the hall light brighten and heard low voices . When the door opened narrowly , Mrs. Pendleton and Nancy stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pouted with disappointment and did n't even speak . Nancy gave a muffled sigh and the anxiety deepened on her face . Only in her eyes did her response to him show , and that seemed worried . Then she said , " Come in , Kirby , " and her voice sounded worried , too ; only he knew she was glad he was there . Mrs. Pendleton gave a sort of half nod as he stepped into the hall , placing his hat and light coat on the rack . She stayed close beside him and Nancy when they moved into the parlor , as if she did n't want them alone together . The room looked more cluttered than usual , and the only object with clear strong outlines was the coarse face of Wash Meade in his gilt frame . Even Nancy lost her sureness , the radiance of her high young color . Kirby , bewildered , spoke out , " What 's the matter ? " Neither of them looked at him . Nancy said , " Father has n't come home . He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , Kirby suffered the terrible letdown . Mrs. Pendleton saw it . She turned all her frustration and weak fury on him . " Anything you wish to talk to him about you can say to me , Mr. Harron . " Kirby sensed the restraining movement from Nancy , but her mother 's words had been like a blow , and Kirby reacted instinctively . " I want to marry Nancy . " Mrs. Pendleton gave an impatient gesture . " I suspected that was on your mind . Well , I 've got too many troubles to think about that . " " This is not a trouble . I can take care of her . Besides , it certainly would n't do her any harm to get away from this opening the door by inches , like I might be a burglar . " " He 's brought home worse than that ; policemen too . " She collected herself a little , tried to be dignified . " I 'm sorry , Mr. Harron , but this is no time " " This is a fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think things are ever going to be any better ? " " Kirby , " Nancy murmured . " Well , why not face things ? I can make them better for her , Mrs. Pendleton , and  --  " " Oh , I 'm too upset to think now ! " It was plain that she was . " This is the last time for him . My brothers told him so . They gave him this big case over in Petersburg , a real chance for him . He 's always complained that they treated him like an upper clerk , when he should 've been an executive . And he is just a clerk . " She stopped , pursing her lips , then sank into a chair . " Sit down , Kirby , " Nancy said . They took chairs near Mrs. Pendleton . She was pretty even now . She wore none of the lines that Kirby 's mother had and her skin was very soft , almost as soft as Nancy 's . She was trying for control , when suddenly she let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm mean to him and that my brothers ruined his life . But there 's another side to it . He saw them being important in business , making money and spending it , and he wanted to be like they were  --  and he 's just not . He 's been a very charming man , but he was n't cut out for their kind of life . He 's always thought he was better than they are , and maybe he is , but that does n't make him a money-maker , like they are . And now I do n't know what 's going to happen to him if they let him go . " Talking about it calmed her somewhat . After a moment , she glanced up at them . She studied Nancy and Kirby as though she had never really seen them together before . Her lips quivered and her soft eyes filled with tears . " I know you 're right , Mr. Harron ? that this is as good a time as any to talk , Mr. Pendleton will never be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich as Jay Gould , and you 'd think there was n't a greater gentleman in Virginia , but - " " Now , mother , " Nancy said quietly , " it 's no use talking like that . " " It 's no use talking anyway , I reckon . I do n't know what to say any more . It 's all out of my hands , and his too . " " Do you mind if Nancy marries me , Mrs. Pendleton ? " " I do n't know anything about you . " " I do , mother , " Nancy said . " I love him . " " Why do n't you talk to your Uncle Vincent ? " " He has n't anything to do with us , mother . " " He 's going to have everything to do with us . He 'll probably have to take care of you . Your father wo n't . " " But , Mrs. Pendleton ? " Kirby began . She jumped up , her pretty mouth twisted as it had been the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk to you , I tell you . I wo n't . You go and see my brother , Vincent Meade . I 'll do whatever he says . And if I 'd done it twenty years ago , I 'd be a lot better off . " She rushed out of the room . As she climbed the stairs , they heard her weeping . Nancy looked crushed . Kirby stood up nervously , took a turn about the room , stopped beside her . Uncertain , he laid his hand on her shoulder . She reached up and took it , clinging almost desperately . " Oh , Kirby , " she said , " the sooner , the better . Go and see him . See anybody , only ? " He looked down at her chestnut hair , softly glowing in the light . He could see the careful brushing and the long care she had taken in drawing it back loosely and so neat from her temples and gathered low on her neck . His hand tightened on her shoulder . " Do n't worry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see , I 'll see him . See if you can have him here the next time I come . " O F WASH MEADE 'S three sons , Vincent was the acknowledged leader . It had always been so , and not only because he was the oldest . Even before they all came to Richmond , he ( Continued an Page 52 ) ( Continued from Paje 50 ) had shown ambition and a flair for figures . In the city he developed imagination and a great vanity . His father encouraged both and Vincent became the family representative in their growing financial ventures . All these the old man turned over to Vincent before he died . Now , in his middle forties , he was a director in Bob 's insurance company and in Charlie 's bank , president and majority stockholder in the Model Paper Company , and a speculator in railroads . He was deacon in his church , committeeman of the Chesterfield Club , engaged in many public philanthropies , and acquainted with powerful financiers from New York and Philadelphia who were pleased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their homes . He needed only to gather together his growing railroad system to complete an empire , and then the Senate was the next step . This spare man in a frock coat waited for Kirby in the cluttered living room the next time he went to the Pendletons ' . Ray Pendleton was there , plainly embarrassed , though he tried not to show it . He wore his finest manner , and his short , erect figure , well filled out , was dressed as if for a ball . His head held high above a wing collar , his thinning brown hair sleekly brushed , his brave mustache pomaded and wax-tipped , he was arrogance and pride . He was Old Richmond , he was Old South , he was the living legend who rode in parades with the Stuart Horse Guards , and he broke over the reality of Vincent Meade  --  who did not ride with the Stuart Horse Guards , but acted on the committee for the new Yellow Tavern monument to Jeb Stuart- Vincent Meade took command , benign and patriarchal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ links , and Nancy , not too close to Kirby on the sofa , waited on her uncle . They had talked it over before he came , and suddenly they were all together , even Nancy , and he was outside . He wished he could hold Nancy 's hand or exchange a single glance . She looked straight ahead while Vincent Meade took over their destinies like the reins of a four-horse team . " Well , Mr. Harron , " he was saying , " I 've been hearing a number of good things about you at Broughton 's mill . We think there 's every reason for you and Nancy to get married as soon as you can unload your personal responsibilities and save enough cash for a down payment on a house of your own . We 'll help you get started , with furniture and the like , and you 'll be in a position to use all your earnings for your married life . Boarding gets you nowhere . It often seems nice to go hoarding at first , because you have no responsibilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profit to someone else . Now , you have proved you can handle money of your own . Use that gift to buy your own house , one for you and Nancy . " " By unloading my responsibilities you mean my family ? " " I do n't mean to cut them adrift in any way . You have a five-thousanddollar equity in an eight-thousanddollar house on the Hill , Turn the house over to them . I 've taken the trouble to investigate your family , Mr. Harron , and I find there are enough people working there to be able to carry the house comfortably and ? " " No , " Kirby interrupted firmly , " I 'm going to take care of them as long as I live , " " Mr. Harron , " Meade said patiently , " we 're talking about your getting married . That is the only way to do it . You 've carried your family all these years , and it 's very fine of you , but you simply must choose between one family and another . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house my family 's in now and ? " " I 've told you that 's uneconomical and , besides , Nancy does n't want to board . " Kirby turned on her , stared until she faced him . Her eyes guarded , her face expressionless , she seemed nothing like the yielding girl he had held in his arms only a few nights ago , saying , " Now , Kirby , now . " He tried to get through to the woman he knew . " You never told me that , Nancy , " he said . " We never talked about it , Kirby . I would he willing to board , anything , if that were the only way . But I 'd rather start in my own home . " Her voice was level , conversational , and belonging to anybody in town . It had nothing to do with him . " So you see , " Vincent Meade said , very smoothly , " you do n't want to start your marriage in a way your wife does n't . " Kirby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting to pounce . He said , " If that 's the way Nancy wants it , we can work that out too . " " I know you have confidence in yourself , and I admire it , but we must deal with cold , hard facts in this working it out . To make money , you must either produce or sell , and you do neither . Obviously , your only hope is to save , but you 're putting yourself in a position where you can hardly keep out of debt . Are you willing to risk marriage on those terms ' ? " Kirby glared at the equine face , spare and potent as a column of figures He glanced toward Mrs. Pendleton , smiling with pretty malice ; at Mr. Pendleton , blandly indifferent , and then at Nancy . This time she would n't look . He would not explain again that he was not controlled by those facts . He said , " Are you , Nancy ? " She had to face him then , her composure held with an effort , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color of them , unlit , as she said , " Not if we do n't have to . " " Well , " he said stubbornly , " we do . " " Oh , no , you do n't , " Vincent Meade cut in , and Nancy turned quickly back to him . " I 've shown you the way out , and there is n't any other . As long as you support your family , the more they 'll lay on you . Your expenses there will grow , not decrease . Your father will get more shiftless ? " " Leave him out of this . " A hard knot was forming in the pit of his stomach . " All right , we 'll leave out him and all the old people in your house . But we ca n't leave out your position , can we ? You know the mill is just hanging on , and Broughton 's getting more old-fashioned all the time . Suppose you 're thrown out of work just when Nancy and your family both need more money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then it would n't close . " Vincent laughed . " The only way anybody will ever manage Broughton 's mill is to own it . Come now , I 'm speaking of your immediate future . " " It looks like you have got it all worked out between you . I thought it was between me and Nancy , but it does n't seem that way any more . " " Now , Kirby , " she said , and this time she really looked at him , and he knew the feeling of having her belong to him at the same time when she was not with him . He could n't get his thoughts straight . Vincent Meade 's arithmetical voice rolled on . " Whatever there is between you and Nancy , you must know your future , because your future is also hers . It must seem obvious , if you reflect a moment " ? and he sounded as if Kirby never had ? " that you ca n't go on being a mill clerk the rest of your life  --  as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but you go about it in the wrong way . You get security by earning large , not by living small . Now , you have worked hard in a one-horse mill for the past ten years , but what of the next ten ? What from here ? From what position will you carry all these responsibilities which you so carefreely shoulder for another 's life ? In brief , have you any future plans ? " Kirby knew he had no answer . He felt the stupid silence heavy within him , felt the hard knot in his stomach straining his nerves . He longed for the release of shouting , like his father had against the Bowerses , longed to be away from here , where everything in him was exposed and dismissed . " No , " he said defiantly . Nancy steadfastly would n't look at him , but Mrs. Pendleton would , with her soft malice . Ray stared beyond them all , while Vincent Meade wrapped his bony fingers together over the watch chain across his vest . " Then , young man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help you with plans . All young people need some help . You have the push and the pluck ; and time , I trust , will supply the good judgment . I 'm willing to take a chance on that . You come over to the Model and take over the office work of our Number Two Mill . It 's new and growing . You can grow with it and from it . I will look after the future and you take care of the present  --  which you do so well . It 'll be worth one hundred a month to you and " No , thank you . " Kirby was seeing the big Negro in livery climbing from Buford Bowers ' carriage and thrusting a basket of food at his mother . " I do n't want charity . " " Kirby ! " Nancy was pale , her eyes wide , though not with the light he liked to remember . Vincent Meade stiffened . " A wonderful opportunity is not considered charity by good businessmen . " Kirby felt his control slipping away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you could 've said so an hour ago . You brought that up when you could n't think of anything else . " " Young man , " he said sharply , " I offered you a position that is worth thirty-three and one third per cent more than your present one . If you do n't care to come with us , that is your affair . But it was not offered , as you say , because I could n't think of anything else . I am not forced to think of anything at all on your behalf . " " Then do n't . " " Really , Mr. Harron , " Mrs. Pendleton began , but her brother silenced her . " That 's all right , Phyllis . I 've tried to help in bringing about a marriage for Nancy . If this young man prefers it his own way , then there 's nothing more I can do . Maybe he 'll show us all we 're wrong , but ? " Kirby jumped up . He was shaking , and he dug his fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Continued from Page 52 ) to hold steady . " I do n't care about showing you anything . All I wanted was to marry Nancy . If she wants it your way , then it 'll have to be with some man like you , but I 'm not turning my family out of their house . " " Well , " Vincent Meade said , " I reckon that settles it . " " No , no ! " Nancy cried . " He 's excited now ! I know how he is , and you all do n't ! I 'll talk to him by myself ! . . Kirby ! " She stood up , facing him , all her love at last hare on her face , and all her distress darkening her eyes . " You come back tomorrow night and we 'll talk together . Uncle Vincent is right about what we 're undertaking , but we can find some way . " " I think that 's best , son . " It was the first time Ray Pendleton had spoken . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Without it , he was a man of real dignity and the only person in the room who seemed to understand Kirby . " You and Nancy have a little talk . Only do n't wait till another night . " That was how Nancy happened to go out into the hail with him , Kirby knew that . She would have let him go alone , to keep from antagonizing her Uncle Vincent , and as it was , she seemed nervous . She was his all right , no doubting that , but it was the same as when they were in the room . She was not with him . " Oh , Kirby , " she whispered , as they stood in the shadow of the vestibule , " you do n't have to he so stubborn . You know that I understand how you feel . " " But you do n't seem to have any confidence in me . " " You know I have . " She moved lightly against him , her hair soft against his jaw , and her hands resting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrying two families , especially when you have n't any prospects . " " I have the prospects inside me . I thought you believed that when we talked about getting married . " " Oh , I do . People will always believe in you . But that 's the future ! It 's now we want to get married . " She moved closer against him . " Put your arms around me . It 's cold out here . " He saw the sheen of her chestnut hair in the faint , reflection from the street lamp . There were no leaves to muffle its shadows . The skeleton of the tree traced a black pattern in the light . " As Uncle Vincent says " Never mind what he says . You did n't think all this before . " " I did n't think before , Kirby . Like you said , it was just thinking of us being together in a life of our own . But I knew we had to talk to the older people . We needed advice and maybe help . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Nancy , I do n't want that kind of help . He 's trying to help make me into something I 'm not and do n't want to he . I want to live the way my own family has . They happen to 've been poor when I came along , but that was n't their fault . Their way is right . " " Hush , Kirby , " she said very gently . " Nobody 's asking you to he like my uncles . They just want you to think of what you are going to be , though . You ca n't go on in this job for all the years to come , can you ? " " I 'll work that out when I get to it . " " Oh , " she said impatiently , and moved back away from him . " They 're not things to come . They 're here and now . I do n't want to live like cry parents have , from hand to mouth . That would ruin everything we had between us . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't believe I 'll give us that ? " " How can I believe that when you wo n't see beyond your nose ? " " All right ! I 'll see beyond my nose ! I 'll give you what you want , what everybody in the whole damned West Side seems to want , if it 's the last thing I ever do ! " " Now , you do n't have to talk that way . " " Yes , I do . I 've got a good life here , and it 's not good enough for the Meades . I 'll get one that 's good enough for John Pierpont Morgan . " " Darling , if you 'd just get one that 's good enough for us . " " Let me ask you one thing : Would it he good enough for you , if I had real prospects , to begin by living with my family in a Weat Side house ? " " I 'll live anywhere wit h you , Kirby , if you 'll just do things right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and nut live small . " XII EIOR the next few days , he spent little time at the mill . First he found a buyer for the Church Street house , willing to pay eighty-five hundred dollars . The park neighborhood was reaching its peak of growth , as space was limited . It had become the finest section an East Hill , and the house , in excellent condition and of pleasing appearance , was at its t op value . Kirby found a large , rick house on the West Side , far out on the new Albemarle Avenue , that stood as desolate and alone as the house on Church Street had when he had first seen it . This house Kirby was able to buy for fifty-five hundred dollars . The owner could not meet the payments on his five-thousand-dollar mortgage , and he was letting the house go for a transfer of the mortgage and five hundred dollars in cash . It had cost seven thousand to build , and had six bedrooms , including a hall room . Kirby took a ten-day verbal option @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went home and had Willie Costello get out the hooks . " It 's sure good you have a bookkeeper in the family , " Willie said cheerfully . He was vain of his handwriting and decorated . the pages with flourishes of flowers and flying birds , while Kirby strode up and down the chilly bedroom . Only a small coal fire burned in the grate and Willie sat near it to keep warm . Kirby was unaware of the chill . He was absorbed in his figures . With everyone 's salary and board accounted for , he could swing his marriage in the new house , if he made no mortgage payments or improvements . Bonny was the only person contributing virtually nothing , and Kirby had a plan for his father . His father would n't like it , I , ut nobody would like any of this . Then he and Willie went downstairs to the dining room and called in the whole family . They came apprehensively , because a gathering meant some new change , and Kirby had been in one of his hardest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any kin , as he stood there in the glow of the table lamp , his lips drawn tight and his dark eyes like agate . " I 've just been figuring , " he said , " that we can carry another house well as we can this one , and that 's the only way 1 can get married . The mortgage on this one is now three thousand . I can sell this one for eighty-five hundred , which gives us fifty-five hundred clear . With Ave hundred I 'll make the cash payment for a new house and assume its mortgage . With the five thousand , have what I need for an investment I 've got to make in order to get married . " In the stunned silence . Emily managed to say faintly , " What kind of investment , son ? ? ' " If Mr. Broughton refuses to make me manager of his mill , I 'll buy it ! "
