Britain 's Minister of Fuel , dour Emanuel Shinwell , balefully noted that some capitalists were lifting up their heads again . Austin Motors ' Leonard P. Lord had charged that the Government 's February auto production estimate of 10,000 was 2,000 more than the truth . Government estimators were under orders to " paint a rosy picture , " said Lord . To the Leeds Labor Council Shinwell made an answer which was Labor 's frankest public statement of its attitude toward nationalization of industry : <P> " . . . Some motor manufacturer has been complaining about the Government and apparently the motor industry leaders are not prepared to play ball . We do not want to nationalize every industry in the country-at any rate , not at present , but they had better be warned . The people of this country are in no mood to stand any nonsense from private ownership . If they can not deliver the goods the Government will do so . . . . <P> " Private property must be used for the benefit of the nation . The private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not too expensive , but this attitude on the part of private enterprise that the Government must not come in and must leave it to private enterprise , is just plain nonsense and bunkum . " <P> If manufacturers had not got the point before , they had it now . Any industry that refused to " cooperate " with the Labor Government 's economic program might find itself nationalized . <P> Gone was the day when Manny Shinwell could generously tell a group of glum businessmen that after Labor was done with industry there would " still remain something like 80% and you can play around with that if you like . " Now he roared that there was " no department of public activity , whether national or local , in which Labor has n't got to have a finger in the pie . " He thundered at . his hearers : " We must be in everything because we are the country . " <P> British Chamber of Commerce Chairman John S. Dodd growled back : " If Mr. Shinwell will concentrate on producing more coal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bunkum , ' there is a fairly good chance we shall produce our goods before he produces his .
