Manhattan 's classy , glassy Museum of Modern Art prides itself on being up-to-date . But last week the Museum opened a show that at first glance looked decidedly oldfashioned . On the walls were 98 photographs by Old Master Alfred Stieglitz , who was 82 when he died last summer . The pictures ranged from 1889 to 1935 ; included horsecarts , snowstorms , " portraits " showing only the hands , unabashedly sexy nudes , and studies of clouds . <P> Visitors accustomed to the sharp , snappy shots that cram the pages of picture magazines and camera annuals might wonder why critics rate Stieglitz the greatest artist in the short history of photography . The answer lay in the pictures , but it was not on the surface . Stieglitz had never resorted to trick camera angles and darkroom shenanigans for their own sake , never searched out dramatic subjects . His art called for consistent understatement . <P> Fame at 26 . Stieglitz himself was just as flamboyant and talkative as his art was quiet . His father , a Manhattan wool merchant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he liked studying photography better . He came home famous at 26 , in a few years had won 150 prizes . Stieglitz was already becoming noted for his " firsts . " He was the first to photograph moving objects at night . His imaginative eye made him a pioneer in picturing airplanes , snowstorms , skyscrapers , clouds . Then , flaunting his black cape in the face of the American dollar , the young romantic announced that he disliked competitions and would not make one picture for money . Stieglitz had plenty of uses for his small private income . One of the first was a magazine-the now classic Camera Work - which proved that photography was an art , and incidentally established the reputations of Paul Strand , Edward Steichen and other young photographers . <P> When he was not photographing and editing , Stieglitz was fighting . No self-respecting art gallery would show photographs , so he opened his own with the help of his growing circle of admirers . Along with photographers , he introduced most of the pioneers of modern art to the U.S. Among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Matisse . He fought for home talent too ; Max Weber , Arthur Dove , Marsden Hartley , John Marin , Charles Demuth and Georgia O'Keeffe ( whom he later married ) all rose to fame through him . But Stieglitz always insisted he was no dealer . He never sold a painting unless he was sure the buyer appreciated it , and refused to take a commission . Stieglitz ' own magnificent collection ( part given and part purchased for a song ) was on exhibition with his photographs last week . <P> Undisturbed Pictures . Stieglitz ' silver mane became the central planet of a worshipful cult . Lewis Mumford , Waldo Frank , Sherwood Anderson , Dorothy Norman and Gertrude Stein all sat at his feet . <P> As he declined into old age , fewer &; fewer new people found their way to the high , white little gallery on Manhattan 's Madison Ave. , called " An American Place . " " I 'm glad , " he would say mysteriously , " that no one has been in today to disturb these pictures . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proprietor 's brooding glance .
