txt  | In the American Manufacturing Belt , differences in language , culture , wealth , and consequent opportunity greatly hinder the leveling processes . Negroes have been moving from the South into the large industrial cities of the North in tremendous numbers . This migration , most pronounced during and following the first World War , took the plantation Negro into an inhospitable urban environment to which he may perhaps be maladjusted , as indicated by his higher death rate . Roughly 85 per cent of the Negro population in the North is urban and is concentrated primarily in the larger cities . It is little wonder then that the old stock fears it is being slowly but surely overwhelmed from within by these great hordes of foreigners and Negroes . As early as 1720 , Christopher Lodowick wrote from New York : " Our chiefest unhappiness here is too great a mixture of nations . " Suburbs and Satellite Cities No one thing connected with urban centers has been more important in recent years than the spilling out of people into the suburbs . In many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though they shared in its municipal government . The big city everywhere is losing out today to its satellites , garden cities , and outlying tributary areas ; it is growing outside rather than inside . Had a master plan been followed , suburbs probably would not be the magnets they are . When cities were laid out , no one could foresee the great industrial growth or improvements in transportation the nation was to experience . Suburbanization has been made possible by improvements iu transportation , especially the automobile . The automobile was a mere curiosity in 1900 , but in 4 decades it transformed cities , created metropolitan areas , attracted people from remote districts into the urban trade territory , and enticed city populations into suburbs . The suburb must rely upon the central city for its economic and social well being : The model suburb , whether it is industrial or residential , however superior , aloof , and detached it may believe itself to he , has ii , basis of existence and dravas much of its sustenance from the noisy , grimy city of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but from which it has managed to remain independent politically.29 Footnote  | Nevertheless , most of the cities are suffering because so many leading citizens live outside their limits while carrying on their business within ; it is for this reason that the political destinies of cities increasingly reside in the " gas-house " type of voter . Metropolitan Districts A metropolis , a city which has grown to gigantic proportions , includes formerly independent towns and villages along with new ones it has created . The United States Census says : Metropolitan districts have been set up for use in the 1940 Census in connection with cities of 50,000 or more , two or more such cities sometimes being in one district . In addition to the central city or cities , the general plan has been to include in the district all adjacent and contiguous minor civil divisions ( townships , etc. ) having a population of 150 or more per square mile . The metropolitan district is thus not a political unit but rather an area including all the thickly settled territory in and around a city or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or less integrated area with common economic , social , and , often , administrative interests.30 Of the 140 metropolitan districts in the United States ( Fig. 131B ) , the American Manufacturing Belt has 65 ; of Canada 's 9 this region has 5 . Many cities have grown too large for the good of their inhabitants . Some chambers of commerce that for years strove to get industries by offering all sorts of inducements are responsible for many industrial maladjustments . It was estimated a few years ago that American cities were spending $10,000,000 a year to attract new industries . America has gone in for big cities , big buildings , big factories , big machines , big everything . " This worship of size , regardless of quality , is a very serious thing . There are grave perils in size ... . Urban megalomania is just as regrettable a disease as elephant iasis . " U1 Thus at one time New York City planned for 30,000,000 people , but decreased immigration , decelerated birth rate , and the depression of the 1930 's at least delayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than is confined within its political or city limits . For example , New York and Chicago even spill over into adjoining states . To an aviator , however , the whole constitutes one city . New York City has expanded far beyond its city limits , crowding the arms and tributaries of New Footnote  | York Bay and Long Island Sound in both New Jersey and Connecticut . Chicago is not just the city incased within definite political limits , but extends along the shore of Lake Michigan for more than 100 miles and includes Waukegan , South Chicago , Whiting , and even Gary ? all as much a part of it as the " loop . " Pittsburgh , capital of the world 's iron and steel industry , means not the city per se but the Pittsburgh District , which includes the cities , townships , and boroughs of its 3 river valleys . Here is a district with almost 2 million people , all with much the same economic interests . Pittsburgh defined politically has roughly only aboutone third of this number . Pittsburgh is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actual city spreading beyond the municipal corporation . The Big City ? Is It Doomed ? Large cities are not reproducing themselves . Moreover , they have grown so big that the poor people live under tragic conditions ( Fig. 132 ) . Most of the big ones are ailing to a greater or lesser degree , yet the average one seems to concern itself more with growing larger than with curing its sickness . Louis Mumford stated in one of his books substantially the following : We cut a steel gash in the bowels of the earth and call it a subway . Every morning we hurl from the Harlem to the Battery , within a concentrated period of time , several hundred thousands of people under disgraceful conditions of crowding . Every evening we repeat the process in the reverse direction , and that is what we are pleased to call civilization . There are many persons who believe that the great city is doomed ? that it is a " dinosaur . " One of these , Oswald Spengler , says that as civilization dries up it concentrates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Carthage and in Rome , so its modern counterpart is drying up in New York , Chicago , and Pittsburgh . " The authors do not concur in this belief that large urban centers will die or disappear , for cities seem to be going through a new stage in their evolution made possible by the automobile ? that of spilling out from the center and over the corporate boundaries . It would appear that " with all its evils , the city is with us as a practical problem . " Footnote  | Rurbanization Rather than have three fourths to four fifths of our population reside in great cities , O. E. Baker recommends rurbanism ? an attempt to attain a balance between agriculture and industry . Model suburbs , garden cities , and suburban homesteads represent variations of this ideal . Certainly there are advantages in combining in the same community the best in urban and rural life . Workers then could live close to the mill and yet enjoy the benefits of semi-rural environment . Baker uses southern New England as an example of rurban life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though small , are possibly more highly improved than anywhere else in the country . He stresses the fact that this is not a matter of superior natural environment but rather of a philosophy of life exemplified by frugality rather than extravagance , culture rather than consumption , and the home as the ultimate measure of success . He thinks New England has developed a civilization that should be studied and adopted elsewhere in the United States . 3 . PRINCIPAL SUBREGIONS OF THE AMERICAN MANUFACTURING BELT Eastern New England Included within this subregion are the industrial parts of Maine , New Hampshire , Rhode Island , Massachusetts , and Connecticut ; in the last two states only those parts east of the Connecticut River are considered . Boston obviously is the dominating center . Of considerable importance also are Providence , Fall River and New Ite 1ford . ' I'Ihis is an area of diversified light industry . Formerly some type of manufacturing was followed in almost every village . Today most of these small mills are abandoned , but this subregion will not heconne one of ghost cities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that specialize on high-grade products that utilize skilled labor and are made from non-bulky or imported raw materials . The metal-goods industry The Ruimifacl ure of small metal wares finds almost ideal condilions here , for this industry ut ilizes skilled labor , caters to a national  | and international market , consumes little fuel , and assembles raw materials at comparatively low cost . The textile industry Cotton . New England was long the center of the nation 's cottontextile industry but it has yielded supremacy to the South in the manufacture of coarse and medium goods . Between 1919 and 1929 New England textile mills declined in number from 324 to 241 . However , the New England textile industry is still nationally important , especially in the preparation of finer fabrics . Today 31 per cent of the industry , based on spindlage , is in Massachusetts , Maine , New Hampshire , and Rhode Island . The textile industry employs about one third of all New Englanders engaged in manufacturing . Among New England 's early advantages were ( 1 ) damp air , which was essential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air frictional electricity results in the yarn twisting and snarling ) , ( 2 ) excellent water-power facilities , and ( 3 ) skilled labor . The two principal reasons for the collapse of the industry are ( 1 ) the failure to keep the plants modern and in condition to operate efficiently , and ( 2 ) costlier labor and shorter working hours . Wool . New England is the indisputed leader in wool-manufacturing industries . Its mills make both woolens and worsteds ? specializing in one or the other . The industry located there because New England was rich in water-power , in clear , soft water , and in wool . New England no longer produces the wool for the industry , but the fact that about 60 per cent of all wool used in the United States moves through Boston is a compensating factor . Woolen manufacturing is more concentrated than cotton manufacturing . Outstanding centers are Lawrence , Providence , Woonsocket , Holyoke , and Lowell , the first three being especially active in worsteds.33 Unlike cotton-textile manufacturing , the woolen branch has not migrated from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the region is the style center for woolens and that the markets for both woolens and worsteds are in the North . Footnote  | The shoe industry New England leads in shoe manufacturing , with eastern Massachusetts possessing the greatest concentration of plants in the world . The chief locative factor is skilled labor , though access to leather and other materials and proximity to markets are important . Brockton , Haverhill , and Lynn are definitely shoe towns ? the first two concentrating on men 's shoes , the last on women 's . The North Shore has always specialized on women 's shoes , the South Shore on men 's . North Shore communities were primarily interested in fishing . The wives , daughters , and sisters of the fishermen obviously preferred to work on women 's shoes , which were lighter in weight than men 's . The South Shore , on the contrary , with few good harbors but better farmland , turned to agriculture . Men were home the year round and preferred to do the heavier work required on men 's shoes.3 " New England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local markets and better access to raw materials . New York , Ohio , Illinois and Wisconsin all have become important in this industry ? a response to the westward migration of the center of population . Cities Boston ( 2,350,514 ) is located in the Boston Basin ? a rolling low-lying plain . The harbor , dotted with grassy islands ? drumlins ? that open into the unbroken reaches of Massachusetts Bay , is commodious and deep and has an irregular shoreline with numerous long , narrow peninsulas . The first settlements took place on these peninsulas or " necks . " Since early days men have filled in the bays and torn down the hills , building much of the city on " made " land.35 Boston early became New England 's outstanding port . It outstripped Salem because it was nearer the interior of Massachusetts.36 Boston harbor is open the year round and is closer to northwest Europe than New York , Philadelphia , or Baltimore . However , vit is primarily an importing port , owing to the fact that its hinterland Footnote  | is confined to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Middle West . Of the 4 major Atlantic seaboard ports , only Boston failed to complete a railroad into the Middle West , contenting itself with a connection between its Boston &; Albany Railroad and those railroads beyond the Hudson River . In 1930 the value of its exports was only one-fortieth that of New York City , one-third that of Philadelphia , and less than two-thirds that of Baltimore.37 Ships frequently unload at Boston before proceeding to New York to take on a load of products that originated in New England . In other words , Boston deals less with New England traffic than does New York City . Providence ( 711,500 ) is located at the head of Narragansett Bay . In spite of access to the sea , its growth is the result of railway traffic . It has always been dwarfed commercially by Boston . Providence , the second-largest city in New England , with its satellites Attleboro and North Attleboro , manufactures most of Anglo-Arnerica 's jewelry . It also produces hardware , tools , and expensive light-weight textiles . Worcester ( 306,194 ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is the second most important industrial city in Massachusetts . With the opening of the Blackstone Canal in 1828 , it became the leading industrial city of the United States not on a natural waterway . Its industries , diverse and well-balanced between metal products and textiles , produce wire , looms ( William Crompton of Worcester invented the fancy loom ) , grinding wheels , envelope-making machinery , rugs , leather belting , and shoes . Lynn ( 98,123 ) , located between Salem and Boston , early became a great shoe-manufacturing center because fishing vessels carried a part of their catch from these harbors and brought back hides as a part of their return cargo . Lynn , unlike other places in New England , never suffered from a scarcity of raw materials . It continues as a great shoe center largely because of its early start . Nevertheless , it was one of three American cities to drop below 100,000 between 1930 and 1940 . Doubtless a major reason for this decline was competition with the Middle West in the shoe industry . Fall River ? New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ textile centers , comprise a single metropolitan district . Fall River , occupying the crest of a long steep hill , was named by Amerinds for the river ( falling water ) which flows through the Footnote  | city and supplies power for its mills . Although its name was synonymous with cotton manufacturing from 1871 to 1929 , Fall River has been the hardest hit of all New England cotton cities . New Bedford , at the mouth of a small river , became the world 's leading whaling port about 1820 . At one time 10,000 seamen maimed its ships . The textile industry started in 1846 and boomed from 1881 to 1883 . It continued to be important until 1921 , when some mills closed , others curtailed production , and still others migrated to the South . New Bedford is today an important fishing center . With the advent of trucks and hard-surface roads , it has also attracted many boats that formerly made Boston and New York their ports . Lowell ? Haverhill ? Lawrence ( 334,969 ) . Lowell , America 's oldest industrial city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ junction of the Merrimac and Concord rivers , it early benefited from abundant water-power . Ease of developing this power and nearness to the port of Boston with which it was connected via the Middlesex Canal were primary considerations in its selection by textile companies prior to 1840 . It also had soft and clear water , with little suspended material ? an aid in the dyeing industry . For a long time Lowell was the leading cotton-manufacturing center of the nation . In addition to its early start , probably the main advantage of Lowell is its proximity to New York City , the primary cotton-goods market , and the fact that spot business * has become more important . Lowell 's future rests upon lowering taxes and reducing t he relief load . Haverhill is located like Lawrence in the Merrimac Valley but is famous for shoes , specializing in high-fashion styles for women . it this industry only Brockton among Massachusetts cities surpasses it . Its other manufactures are paper , woolen goods , chemicals , and hats . Lawrence lies in the narrow trough along the Merrimac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wool-manufacturing city , primarily because of its water-power . Its great red brick mills are strung out along the river banks . It still is predominant because of nearness to clothing manufacturers and because the high value of wool enables it to stand transportation charges from the far corners of the earth . In recent years Lawrence has begun to manufacture soap and paper . Footnote  | Southwestern New England This subregion includes the parts of Massachusetts and Connecticut that lie west of the Connecticut Valley . Here factories specialize on light products requiring high mechanical skill ? machinery , tools , hardware , firearms , electrical goods , watches , and clocks . These are all products of high value and small bulk , which require little raw material and power , and can easily stand transport charges to distant markets . From early days towns making the same products were in the same river valley , because expansion logically takes place along " topographic lines of least resistance . " Thus the brass industry is strung along the Naugatuck Valley in Connecticut from Torrington to Bridgeport . The manufacture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predominates in this subregion . The market center is New York rather than Boston . The Springfield-Holyoke metropolitan district ( 394,623 ) includes Chicopee , West Springfield , Westfield , and Northampton . Springfield lies on the east bank of the Connecticut River and is most famous of the alluvial terrace towns of the valley . Every city and town whose name ends in " field " was founded because of its distinct advantage over sites on the floodplain . Springfield owes its commercial importance to the fact that the Boston &; Albany Railroad crossed the Connecticut Valley at that point . Its principal industries make electrical goods , motorcycles , machine tools , radios , and refrigerators . Holyoke is built on numerous canals that have provided cheap power . It is famous as a producer of quality writing paper , made of rag scrap from near-by textile mills . It also makes fine textiles ? woolen , worsted , silk , cotton , and rayon . New Haven ( 308,228 ) , at the confluence of three small rivers , is situated on a shallow harbor difficult to navigate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except incoming coal and petroleum . Essentially an industrial city specializing in light manufacturing New Haven produces hardware , tools , firearms , wire , railroad equipment , clocks , and toys . It is probably best known , however , as the home of Yale University . Bridgeport ( 216,621 ) lies at the mouth of one of the small rivers flowing into Long Island Sound . It was formerly an important whaling port , but the arrival of life first inilroad iii I8I ( I diverted all interest to uiannfnet in ing.  | Bridgeport probably is not surpassed in the manufacture of diversified products . Its acres of factories pour out brassware , brake linings , electrical equipment , hardware , machinery , muni tions , pharmaceuticals , rubber goods , tools , sewing machines , and typewriters . Hartford ? New Britain ( 502,193 ) , on the Connecticut River , early became important as a bulk-breaking point for the upper valley . The river navigation that was so important in the early commercial life of the cities never recovered after the War of 1812 .

It is the largest city in Connecticut and the most important insurance center in the world .

New Britain is the hardware center of the North American continent , producing half the hardware made in Connecticut and about one tenth of that made in the United States . Its first articles ? sleigh bells were sold by Yankee peddlers about 1800 . This business created a demand for other light articles ? such as cutlery and edge tools , which were made in small shops . Industrial New Britain did not come into its own until the era of steam power , for this city had inadequate water-power . Waterbury ( 144,822 ) occupies the valley of the Naugatuck and lad rivers . This typical Yankee industrial town is the center of the brass industry of the North American continent , and is known for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ District The New York area ( 11,690,520 ) is one of superlatives . It is North America 's most populous and cosmopolitan district and the most intense mixing-bowl . It has the best harbor and is the largest port , and it leads in commerce , manufacturing , and finance . It also dictates the nation 's styles and attracts the greatest number of tourists . This area is located at the mouth of the navigable Hudson River on a well-protected deep-sea harbor and at the focus of major land and sea routes . By value it handles approximately one half of the nation 's commerce . Its harbor consists of 7 bays , 4 rivers , 4 estuaries , and 12 different channels ( Fig. 134 ) . The Hudson River scours out the mouth of the bay , keeping the channel deep . The  | direct waterfrontage is 771 miles , and 347 of it have been developed . The harbor includes the Hudson River , the Upper Bay , the Narrows , the Lower Bay , Newark Bay , Kill Van Kull , Arthur Kill , the East @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Channel , Bay Ridge Channel , Gravesend Bay , Sheepshead Bay , Sandy Hook Bay , and Raritan Bay ( Fig. 134 ) . Most of these channels are deep enough to accommodate the largest ships afloat . The channel leading to the Atlantic is direct . The tidal range is so narrow that ships may come and go at almost any time . Ice never blocks the harbor , though fog occasionally holds up traffic . ( At times the fog is so thick that ships and ferries can not stir for several days . ) New York is the only Atlantic port with an easy route into the interior ? the Hudson-Mohawk Depression ( Fig. 135 ) . The Erie Canal ( now the New York State Barge Canal ) more than any other single factor contributed to New York 's greatness as a port , for it made all the country between the Great Lakes and the Ohio River and between the Mississippi and the Atlantic tributary to the Atlantic Seaboard and largely to New York City . The New York Central Railroad , following the route of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rails from the Middle Vest almost to the tip of Manhattan . Other railroads have established marine and rail termini on the west side of the Hudson as near to the New York Central as possible . As a result , the Port of New York has 12 railroads . Congestion The great amount of water , while advantageous to commerce , is a barrier to traffic between Manhattan and the rest of the New York area . For decades attempts have been made to mitigate the traffic congestion in and about New York City . In 1936 New York 's subways , elevated lines , surface cars , busses and taxis handled 3 billion passengers.38 Because of the small area and the hordes of human beings that come and go into the city daily , the most elaborate subway system ever conceived has been built , while above ground is operated an extensive bus system . Vehicular tunnels have been built ? the longest in the world ; great suspension and steel-arch bridges have been built across the rivers . Railroads enter Manhattan via tubes under the Iludson and Iast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | Figure estimated that the water barriers of Manhattan cost each New Yorker $10 per year . With the added bridges and tunnels built since then the per capita cost must be considerably more . ' " The gust of ferrying a ton of freight across New York harbor would take tlutt same ton 200 to 600 miles by rail . ' ? Skyscrapers Most urban sites permit almost indefinite lateral expansion . Southern Manhattan , with a restriction of space , is an exception ,  | for " nothing less than -a thickly populated skyscraper can meet ground rent and taxes . " Fortunately , Manhattan consists almost entirely of solid rock and hence provides the foundations for the skyscrapers which make New York 's jagged skyline the most aweinspiring sight in the world ( Fig. 136 ) . Population The population ( white ) of New York in 1626 , the year Manhattan passed from the Amerinds , was less than 200 . In 1940 the population of New York City had reached a total of 7,454,995 . If wee add to this population that included in the metropolitan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jersey ) , Peekskill ( New York ) , and Norwalk ( Connecticut ) ? the total approximates 12,000,000.41 The population is mostly in Manhattan and Long Island and in the peninsulas of the Bronx and Bayonne . New York 's foreign-born population , representing every part of the globe , is extraordinarily high , being 73 per cent as against 31 per cent for the nation . Should these foreigners and the 440 , - 000 Negroes be removed , " whole cities within New York City ( including the slums ) would be deserted . " 42 Of the 5 million foreign-born whites , more than one half came from eastern and southeastern Europe and less than a third from northwestern Europe . The city is peppered with Little Spains , Little Italies , Little Rumanias , and so forth . New York City also draws heavily on the native white population of all 48 states , approximately three quarters of a million New Yorkers having been born outside New York State . ' " Commerce New York , the greatest port in the world , has a ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daylight hours . 1 It 1938 the-value of its tonnage was $9,258,000,000 , or more than 11-per cent of that of the nation.44 With its hundreds of steamship piers , it accommodates more than 9,000 vessels ( foreign and coat - wise ) each year . Some of the piers exceed 1,000 feet in length and are equipped with the most modern types of loading and unloading machinery ( Fig. 137 ) . Footnote  | Picture The Hudson River , including the New Jersey side , handles more than half the port 's business based on value , and yet it occupies only about 10 miles out of a total of 771 for the entire port . The imports include chiefly fuel oil ; mil gas , crude oil , raw sugar . p 416 fruits , coffee , flaxseed , rubber , raw silk , gypsum , and paper , whereas the principal exports are iron and steel scrap , refined petroleum products , automobiles and parts , wheat and flour , and livestock feeds .

Its banks had deposits in 1938 of $17,617,000,000 and cleared checks to a total of $163,000,000,000 ? 53 per cent of the country 's total.4b Because New York is the financial center of the United States , many national concerns have selected New York as their headquarters . This is true of the big oil , steel , and automobile companies whose actual manufacturing operations are carried on elsewhere . Industry Unlike Chicago , Pittsburgh and Cleveland , the New York area , because of the competition for available land , does not manufacture heavy products such as pig iron and steel . Its industries are clothing , printing , oil refining , chemicals , tobacco , metal products , fertilizer , asphalt , metal smelting and refining , soap , silk manufacturing , sugar refining , and slaughtering . The garment industry The garment industry , America 's fourth largest based on valise of products , operates in all but 7 of the 48 states . This industry . New York 's largest , is highly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between Times Square on the north , Twenty-fifth Street on IIII , south , Eighth Avenue on the west , and Fifth Avenue on 1Ile east . Three quarters of the 200,000 Manhattan garment laborers work in an area 200 acres in size . This indicates that , unlike the steel and automobile industries , garment factories , which ihri in the crowded conditions of a city , do not need huge plants . The shops are generally small and there are 7,000 of them , the nverage employing only about 30 workers . New York promises to re . i n : i i n the capital of the garment industry so long as it can maintain itself as the style and buying center of the United States . Footnote  | The clothing trade is inextricably bound up with immigration . Irish and Germans , constituting the first reservoir of labor ( up to and through the 1880 's ) , were followed by Russians , Bohemians , Poles , and Italians . Hardly a nationality exists that is not represented , though Italians predominate at present . These immigrants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unions . About 74 per cent of the nation 's women 's clothing and about one third of the men 's wear is made in New York City . The chemical industry The New York area is the continent 's largest single chemical center , with between 15 and 20 per cent of the industry . Most plants are large and are growing larger . The most important branch produces heavy chemicals including acids , ammonia , sodas , and potash . The harbor location enables raw materials to be assembled from widely scattered areas . Furthermore , the finished products find a huge market at hand . The roomier New Jersey part of the area is most important for heavy chemicals . The finer chemicals , particularly pharmaceuticals , are made mostly in Brooklyn . Oil refining The New York metropolitan area is the outstanding petroleumrefining center in the world . Since it is cheaper to ship crude oil t Ilan refined products , almost every major oil company that carries on business in the metropolitan area has a plant on New York harbor . Vast quantities of crude are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by tanker from California , the Gulf ( ' oast , and Caribbean Latin America . Much of the refined product s , particularly gasoline , is distributed by barge , although gasoline pipelines are becoming increasingly important . New York 's oil refineries are located on the New jersey side of the Hudson ! liver because of storage-space demands , the obnoxious fumes , and fire and explosion hazards . Five New Jersey plants have plul s averaging a square mile or more in extent . Bayonne is one of the world 's largest refining centers ( Fig. 138 ) . All plants in this ari a are situated on the waterfront to facilitate imports of crude oil and exports of finished products . Southeastern Pennsylvania Southeastern Pennsvlvania comprises the area from Philadelphia to Wilmington , tuL ( t her with Baltimore and smaller areas in  | New Jersey , Delaware , and Maryland . No other subregion shows such a combination of heavy and light manufacturing ? everything from iron and steel to silk . Though Philadelphia is the hub , much business and trade , especially in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , southeasternmost point of this subregion as well as of the entire American Manufacturing Belt , is noted both for commerce and manufacturing . Since more than one third of its employed citizens are supported by manufacturing , however , the city is considered as essentially Indust rial . Philadelphia ( 2,898,644 ) , on the outside of the major bends of the Schuylkill and Delaware rivers , occupies a narrow neck of land between them and accordingly benefits from deep water . The Schuylkill passes from the Piedmont to the Coastal Plain , in a series of falls which end just northwest of the apex of the great bend of that river . " Philadelphia thus may be considered both a Piedmont and a Coastal Plain city . We shall include it in the 1 merican Manufacturing Belt because the area from Boston to Baltimore is so highly industrialized . Philadelphia is not so old as either New York or Boston . Howver , it surpassed both in trade and population about the middle i if the eighteenth century , primarily because of its local tributary area , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was significant before the day of fast transportation ? when cities were fed by their immediate tributary areas . Philadelphia , t he nation 's first planned city , was laid out on the familiar checker ) ward pattern . As the population of the Atlantic Seaboard spilled over the mountains following the Revolutionary War , the attack upon the natural resources of trans-Appalachia began . All 4 main Atlantic ports attempted to reach back beyond the mountains and bring as much trade as possible within their influence . New York completed its Erie Canal to the Great Lakes ; Philadelphia had to supplement its Pennsylvania Canal with a railroad that lifted the I H gat s over the mountains ; Baltimore 's Chesapeake &; Ohio Canal was halted at Cumberland , where the mountains form a wall 2,000 feet high ; and Boston , with 2 uplands to cross , realized that the building of a canal was impossible . From early days Philadelphia has ranked high in manufacturing , being favored by : Footnote  | 1 . Superior locational advantages ? ( a ) at the head of navigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bends of its two rivers . 2 . Power ? ( a ) hydro at the Fall Line and ( b ) anthracite in near-by northeastern Pennsylvania . 3 . An abundance of flat land . 4 . Energetic and able people ? Quakers , Germans , Dutch , a n 1 Scotch-Irish . The industries are highly diversified . Textiles , the first hoportant enterprise , still lead . Leather tanning , a pioneer industry . has been favored by a plentiful supply of soft water and formerly by forests of oak and hemlock . Now that the United States depends much on imported tannins , Philadelphia 's location as a port is advantageous . Philadelphia also leads in sugar refining , cigarmaking , and in the production of rugs and carpets , locomotives , tools , and chemicals . It is the nation 's largest ship-building center , with 4 different concerns . The metropolitan district is also a leading oil-refining center and petroleum products constitute about 60 per cent of the exports . Philadelphia , a great seaport , has a navigable waterfrontage .. f 38 miles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well served by railroads ? the Pennsylvania , Baltimore &; Ohio , and the Philadelphia &; Reading together serving the greater part of the count ! east of the Mississippi River . The principal imports are crude oil , raw sugar , bananas , fertilizer ingredients ( potash and nitrate ) , wood pulp , and china clay . The principal exports are petroleum products , iron and steel scrap , coal , and coal tar . Camden lies opposite Philadelphia on the Delaware River . Because it is economically a part of Philadelphia , it is included in that city 's metropolitan area . As a manufacturing city it , is famous for its canning factories , ship-building yards , and phonograph factory . It is the home of the Campbell Soup Company , the largest maker of canned soups in the world , whose plant consists of 42 buildings covering .8 city blocks . Camden is advantageously located with respect to the important truck-farming region near by . This city is the leading manufacturing , commercial , and industrial center of southern New Jersey .

It also occupies a strip of low land between the river and the hills . Wilmington , Delawares only city of over .5 too inhabitants , has iii ils metropolitan distdel coiisideralily snore than half ' of the  | Mate 's population . It is important industrially , with machine shops , foundries , paper and textile mills , and plants that produce hydraulic jacks and leather-working machinery . It leads all other areas in Anglo-America in the manufacture of glazed kid and is especially noted for hard fiber and rubber hose . Wilmington is also the headquarters for the 3 largest explosives manufacturers in North America ? DuPont , Hercules , and Atlas . ( ' ontrary to general opinion , however , no explosives are made in I ) elaware . The DuPont Company is probably the world 's largest diversified chemical manufacturer .

The river was deepened in 1932 to accommodate sea-going vessels , but it is little used except by sand and coal barges . Trenton 's location on the direct land route between Philadelphia and New York has brought to it many industries , especially those engaged in making secondary steel products such as cables and steam turbines . Since 1850 it has been one of the nation 's great pottery centers , specializing in fine china ( Lennox ware ) . The pottery industry uses some of the common clays from New Jersey and Pennsylvania , but the better clays are procured from Florida , North Carolina , and Cornwall , England . More important than local clays are the markets and skilled labor . Trenton has long been the Mecca for immigrants trained in ceramics . Baltimore ( 1,046,692 ) , America 's eleventh-largest metropolitan district and its seventh-largest city , as well as one of its leading industrial and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ navigation on the Patapsco River , about 12 miles from Chesapeake Bay and 170 statute miles from the Virginia Capes . Baltimore is a striking example of that class of cities able to penetrate far inland as a result of the drowning of river mouths . The harbor , consisting of the dredged Patapsco River and its tributaries , hies about 40 miles of deep-water frontage . Baltimore has always looked seaward ; shipping and trade have been in its blood from the beginning . Its kinship with the sea goes hack to the day when foreign marts were imperative to take rare of the surplus agricultural commodities of colonial Maryland . Baltimore is one of the I principal gateways from the Atlantic to the interior . It , ranks first iii imtercoastal service with the  | Pacific Coast via the Panama Canal . Baltimore 's outstanding advantages are ( 1 ) location on the enlarged Chesapeake &; Delaware Canal , which links the 2 bays and brings Baltimore 24 hours closer to New England and northwestern Europe than formerly , ( 2 ) nearness to the important coal fields of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facilities ( America 's first railroad , the Baltimore &; Ohio , was started here in 1827 ) , and ( 4 ) an eastbound freight differential of 3 cents per 100 pounds under the New York rate . Baltimore has , in the Sparrows Point plant , the world 's largest and America 's only tidewater iron and steel industry . The plant was located here after a careful engineering study had indicated that Baltimore was the most desirable site on the Atlantic Seaboard . Though all of its raw materials come from some distance ( limestone from Pennsylvania , coal from the Virginias , and iron ore from Chile and Cuba ) , Sparrows Point has probably the lowest pig iron costs outside of Birmingham . Other outstanding industries are the manufacture of food and kindred products ? the second-largest meat-packing plant on the Atlantic Seaboard being located here . Canning and preserving have since the beginning of this industry been outstanding in Baltimore . The treatment of non-ferrous metals ( Baltimore is the largest copper-refining center in the world ) , the manufacture of transportation equipment , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of various kinds , all are importai t . Petroleum refining is outstanding because of the port 's advantageous position for receiving crudes and distributing refined products to the Middle Atlantic and southeastern portions of the country . Baltimore ranks high in the manufacture of commercial fertilizer ; it had the first factory in the country and is well located for gathering the ingredients from all over the world , and for supplying quickly and economically those parts of the country that use fertilizer most extensively . The Mohawk Valley and the Ontario Plain The Mohawk Valley and the Ontario Plain occupy the great water-level route from Troy to Buffalo and are traversed by the main line of the New York Central Railroad , the New York State Barge Canal , and U.S. Highway 20 . Most of the industries are secondary rather than primary and in many ways are similar to those of Southwestern New England . The subregion is : IIIHO ? t enHililetely urhaiiized.  | products .

This subregion , lacking a capital of its own , lies within the orbit of New York City . Albany-Troy-Schenectady ( 431,575 ) lie close enough together to form a single metropolitan district . Albany , at the great bend in the Mohawk Route , near the head of deep-water navigation on the Hudson , and between New York City and Montreal , has long been an important transportation center . It began as a commercial city and has so remained , ranking high today in the trans-shipment of wheat , soda ash , and petroleum . Albany 's factories produce goods of all kinds , a few of which are chemicals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper products , and clay goods . Troy , on the opposite bank of the Hudson and 6 miles north of Albany , lies at the head of tidewater and is the eastern terminus for the New York State Barge Canal . Formerly the national center for the manufacture of collars and cuffs , it still ranks high in men 's wear , especially shirts and collars . Schenectady , 15 miles northwest of Albany on the delta of the Mohawk , is a major industrial center . It is the home of the General Electric and the American Locomotive Company . The materials required for making electrical equipment and locomotives , as well as the principal markets for the output , are accessible to Schenectady . Utica-Rome ( 197,128 ) , despite their inclusion by the Census in the same metropolitan district , differ economically . Rome 's industries produce steel wire , cables , and tubes , as well as articles of copper and brass , whereas Utica produces mainly textiles and cloturing . About one third of Utica 's labor is employed in knitting factories . Syracuse ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between Albany and Buffalo , dominates the central portion of the subregion . It , is connected will Lake Ontario by the canalized Oswego River , a branch of the New York Slate Barge Canal . As a major mawifacl tiring city , Syracuse . leads in foundry. protool steel , automobile parts , cer ; i t ics , and shoes . Syra-  | cuse china and Nettleton shoes are famous for their high quality . In its soda industry , Syracuse utilizes a local resource ? salt ? and in this respect is unique , since almost every other manufacturing enterprise in the city makes use of raw materials from distant sources . Rochester ( 411,970 ) gained early prominence as a result of its site at the falls of the Genesee . This water-power , along with the city 's location in the heart of the early American wheat belt ( especially in the first half of the nineteenth century ) , enabled Rochester to become the leading flour-milling center of the continent . Rochester also shared in the important east-west transportation along the Hudson-Mohawk route via canal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic center for much of the Finger Lakes District . Rochester is better known than most cities , regardless of their size , because of its national prestige in the manufacture of cameras , optical goods , scientific instruments , and certain types of electrical equipment , all requiring highly skilled workers : It also takes high rank in the manufacture of men 's clothing . The **37;1115;TOOLONG Subregion ( Niagara Frontier ) This subregion lies between lakes Ontario and Erie in western New York and adjacent Ontario . It is complicated by the inter national boundary which , as a result of the tariff , plays a vital role in causing manufacturing to be more important on the ( ' anadian side than otherwise would be the case . In the entire British Empire , the Province of Ontario ranks second only to the United Kingdom in manufacturing . The power from Niagara Falls Is widely used on both sides of the border and has played an imports i lt part in the development of chemical , metallurgical , and other industries . Because of the international border there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Toronto on the Canadian . Iron and steel At Lackawanna , a part of metropolitan Buffalo , is one of America 's greatest iron and steel industries . The Lackawanna ' Iron and Steel Company moved here from a location it had occupied at Scranton for 60 years . Like other Lower lake cities , Buffalo is an economic meeting place of coal , iron ore , and fluxing limestone . I is Has ( furnaces and coke ovens are so located on a ship canal that lake carriers can deliver economically to them iron ore . limestone ,  | and coal . Lying in the heart of a great iron- and steel-consuming area , Buffalo plants can deliver their finished products by barge , Like freighter , railway , and truck . Besides the Lackawanna plant , 1 here are several others in Buffalo . In Hamilton , Ontario , is one of Canada 's leading iron and steel Industries . Its chief advantages for making steel are : 1 . Location on Lake Ontario , which facilitates the assembly of rtlw materials and the marketing of finished steel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Welland Canal . Excellent rail facilities . The city is on Canada 's 2 transconlittental railroads , while a third connects with railways in the 1'Irited States . 3 .

G. Ample water of good quality and temperature . 7 . An abundance of flat land for expansion and growth . Flour-milling Buffalo is the world 's leading flour-milling center , having disrInccd Minneapolis in 1930 . This is a reversal of the trend of tcrly days when mills grew up in the wheat-growing regions Rochester ( New York ) , Kansas City ? or on the market sides of hem ( Minneapolis ) . Buffalo 's mills reap the advantages of cheap liter transportation on the Great Lakes , nearness to the large , nsuming markets of the East , low power costs , excellent transort ation facilities in all directions , and the milling-in-bond privlegl , . ' 7 Iectro-chemical and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world 's leaders in the production of alloys , aluminum , abrasives , and so on . Its advantages are ( 1 ) an abundance of cheap hydro-power , ( 2 ) the Footnote  | availability of raw materials , ( 3 ) the meeting of rail and water transportation , and ( 4 ) the presence and proximity of a large consuming market . Cities Buffalo ? Niagara ( 857,719 ) . Buffalo , on Lake Erie at the mouth of Buffalo Creek , owes its early growth to a strategic location at , the foot of lake navigation , where Lake Erie discharges into the Niagara River . It commands the eastern end of Lake Erie . Major factors in its growth were the old Erie Canal and later the railroad which connected it with New York City . Few cities in the Western Hemisphere are its equal in the combination of modes of land and water transportation . Buffalo benefits industrially by being near Pennsylvania coal and Niagara Falls hydro-power . It shares equal rates with Chicago , Detroit , and Cleveland on Lake Superior iron ore . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heaviest consuming markets . Buffalo is the logical point of trans-shipment for lake-borne traffic destined for New York or Boston . It is the great American shipping point for wheat ? Canadian and American . Since wheat is an excellent filler for a general cargo on liners , huge tonnages are transferred from lake carriers at Buffalo and sent to Atlantic ports . Especially does this city handle much wheat during winter when the St. Lawrence can not be utilized . The city of Niagara Falls has unrivaled power resources which have drawn to it a special group of industries ? electro-chemical and electro-metallurgical ? which demand huge quantities of cheap power . A few of the important products are aluminum , carborundum , and synthetic nitrogen . Toronto ( 657,612 ) on the north shore of Lake Ontario , is Canada 's second-largest city and the only great one whose population in homogeneous . It commands the easiest and shortest route to Georgian Bay and the Upper Lakes country . Toronto is strategically located also with respect to the rich agricultural lands of the Ontario Peninsula and the productive mining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Niagara Falls , t ho city has access to an abundance of cheap power and has become 1 ho chief manufacturing center of Ontario , making clothing , elect rival equipment , and machinery . It is also the leading meat-paekinK center of the Dominion . The Toronto harbor front , a marvel of engineering , has played a dominant role in the growth and de ? elopncent of the city . On it  | two modern industrial areas were created from poorly drained land . coal and coke , petroleum , grain , and general merchandise comprise I lie principal items in the water-borne trade . Hamilton ( 164,719 ) is located at the western end of Lake Ontario on a deep , protected , and commodious harbor at the base of the Niagara Escarpment . It ranks fifth in population but third in manufacturing among Dominion cities . It is the most represent- ' a five manufacturing city of all , with about one half of its workers employed in factories and mills . Hamilton made its harbor comI detely modern to take advantage of the benefits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iron and steel industry , Hamilton ranks high in t lie production of textiles , chemicals , rubber goods , soaps , electrical equipment , and canned foods . Erie ( 134,039 ) is included in the Niagara Frontier because it is too small to comprise an independent subregion and because the .1 i nerican iron and steel industry considers it a part of the " Buffalo 1 ) istrict . " Erie is located at the only place on Pennsylvania 's straight and uninviting Lake Erie shore where there is a good protected harbor . This is made possible by the hooked spit of Presque Isle . Occupying an area of flat to undulating land on Presque Isle Bay , the city has been free to spread in 3 directions . With a restricted hinterland , Erie has been unable to keep pace with Cleveland and Toledo ; nevertheless it is today Pennsylvania 's sixth-largest metropolitan area , being surpassed only by Philadelphia , Pittsburgh , Scranton , Reading , and Harrisburg . Though Erie is an important trading center ( millions of tons of coal , iron ore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is essentially an industrial city , its factories supporting more than two thirds of the population . A few plants are located on the waterfront , but tuost of them are strung out along the railroads . The most import ant industries are those engaged in making metal products and paper . Erie is especially noted for mechanical refrigerators . The Pittsburgh-Cleveland Subregion The Pittsburgh-Cleveland subregion is the continent 's outstanding metallurgical center . It also has a diversity of other industries , ouch as rubber tires , electrical machinery , motor vehicles , machine tools , airplane parts , paints and varnish , clay products , clothing and textiles . : iii glass . The dominant centers , Cleveland and Pittsburgh , are followed closely by Youngstown , Akron , and Wheeling . This area supplies suutlwaslern Jlichigan and most of Ohio  | and eastern Indiana with the raw and semi-finished steel used their secondary industries . The area is strategically located for heavy industry , since it lies between Lake Erie on the north , over whose waters move the millions of tons of iron ore and limestone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Iron and steel A large part of North America 's metallurgical industry is local et in this subregion ( Fig. 139 ) . Through concentration of production the steel industry has been able to reduce its costs below what would have been possible if steel plants were seal iered throughout the country with primary thought given to location . of consum er ' plants and secondary consideration to the costs of assembling raw materials . Figure Footnote  | It would not be economical , for instance , to manufacture steel in quantity at points in the great Mid-Continent oil province , nor tin plate for cans in every canning center . The consumer 's chief hope is for cheaper transportation costs . No one steel-producing area is ideal , all being affected by influences favorable and unfavorable , natural and artificial . " Most iron and steel manufacturing is still carried on near sources of raw materials . Though proximity to market is an ever growing factor , assembly costs are the more compelling . Unfortunately , nature seldom places raw materials in accord with consuming cent ( Ts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that point where raw materials and markets for the finished . products both are available . No single steel center in North America combines these , though Chicago and Detroit approach this condition most closely . In the United States iron ore usually moves toward the coal fields ( Fig. 140 ) , the main reason being the presence of general nianufacturing districts ? the largest markets for most steel products - in or near the coal fields . To produce 1 ton of pig iron requires : shout 1.7 tons of iron ore , .9 tons of coke , and .4 tons of limestone . The problem of fluxing stone is less important than that of ore and coal because limestone is widely distributed . Two states , Pennsylvania and Michigan , supply 62 per cent of the country 's metallurgical stone . The world 's largest quarries , those at Calcite on I.ake Huron , provide 27 per cent of the steel industry 's requires i tents .

The geographic assets and liabilities for making iron and steel in I'iitsburgh , Cleveland , Youngstown , Wheeling , Johnstown , Canton , and Massillon are presented in the discussion of those cities . By-product coke . No discussion of the iron and steel industry is justifiable without mention of the manufacture of coke ? the chief fuel used in blast furnaces . Before the development of by-product ov ens , coke was made in " bee hive " ovens from which the valuable olatile materials escaped into the open air . Coke , almost pure : trhon , is made by driving off certain volatile materials . ' I'lte " bee hive " industry was virtually dead until the time of the second World War . It then provided a reserve source of coke when Footnote  | by-product ovens could not meet the demand . The most famous " bee hive " coke center was Connellsville , southeast of Pittsburgh , where coal from the Pittsburgh seam made superior coke . Accordingly , myriads of ovens sprang up in its tributary area . " Bee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since the by-products ( gas , tar , oils , and chemicals ) were not saved . By-product coke , on the contrary , is made in or near cities ? manufacturing centers , where the hyproducts not used by the iron and steel industry itself are available . The largest by-product- plant in the world is located at Clairton at the southern end of Pittsburgh on the Monongahela Piver.  | The rubber industry The rubber industry and Akron have long been synonymous to the average American . Rubber made Akron . This city along with its suburbs manufactures about one half of the nation 's tires . Akron 's first rubber factory was established in 1870 ? the result of sheer accident . B. F. Goodrich , dissatisfied with his business prospects at the close of the Civil War , engaged in-the oil business . Being unsuccessful , he went to New York and dealt in real estate . In. his dealing he came into possession of a rubber factory at Hastings-on-the-Hudson . Handicapped by lack of funds , he was encouraged to go to Akron by a friend who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nucleus of the great Akron rubber industry . ' ? Shortly other rubber enterprises came . Concentration of rubber manufacturing was a good thing during the industry 's infancy , for buyers and sellers could get together conveniently . Akron was also a central spot for skilled labor . Now that the industry is mature , however , concentration is no longer desirable . Mills have sprung up in Alabama , California , yZaryland , Mississippi , New England , and New York , as well as in foreign countries . This decentralization is the outgrowth of the serious sit-down strikes of the 1930 's and of the trend of automobile production away from Detroit . The clay-products industry The industry whose products include brick , china ware , clay refractories , porcelain , terra cotta , tile , pottery , and vitrified sewer pipe is especially important in the Upper Ohio Valley of Pennsylvania and Ohio . The high degree of concentration , despite the fact t hat clays are widely distributed throughout North America , indicates that the raw material as a factor of location is less important t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor . The Ohio Ii iver area is especially well located with respect to fuel ? both coal and natural gas . The stoneware industry , centered at East Liverpool ? the cons inent 's leader in pottery , procures its clays from Georgia and Florida ( kaolin ) , Maine and Canada ( feldspar ) , Kentucky and Tennessee ( bill clay ) , and Illinois and Pennsylvania ( flint ) . The clay refractories or heat-resisting products industry is located principally in the Allegheny Plateau of Pennsylvania , where the fire clay is inter-Footnote  | layered with bituminous coal . This clay is procured underground rather than from surface pits . Clay refractories are in demand by the iron and steel industries near by . Because of the high tariff on imported china , the Havilands , after much research on American clays , selected Shenango , Pennsylvania , as the site for their American factory . The glass industry For 5,000 years glass-making was a handicraft ? the workers being highly skilled . About 1908 , machines began to perform the operations and , except in the non-standardized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Glass is made by fusing sodium sulphate , calcium carbonate ( pure limestone ) , and quartz sand . The chief locative factors are , in order of their importance : 1 . Fuel , especially natural gas . 2 . Proximity to market ( glass is fragile and bulky and takes high freight rates ) . 3 . Efficient transport facilities . 4 . Access to raw materials . 5 . Availability of labor . Charcoal , the first fuel used , was later displaced by coal , and finally by natural gas . At first glass-making was concentrated east of the Appalachians , but the adoption of the new fuels resulted i i western Pennsylvania , southeastern Ohio , and northern West ti i r ginia becoming the chief center . Natural gas is the ideal fuel because it is clean and inexpensive and produces very high and uniform temperatures . An immense amount of heat must be available to melt the raw materials . Glass sand and other materials invariably travel to where cheap fuel is located . Thus cen 1 ru l Pennsylvania , with great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gas , has no glass industry . Natural gas , then , is the major factor contributing to the location of this manufacturing , enterprise . Machine tools The machine-tool industry came into being as a separate entity about 1870 , when industrialists were widely adopting mass-production methods . New England had been the source of most of , Auierica 's machine tools . As nnaniifacttiring ii igrnle I estwartI , i1 hall to have metal-cutting machines , nnI 1ev l ; n land 's factories were  | too far away to supply them . The first plant in Ohio was established in Cincinnati shortly after the Civil War . Cleveland , which today ranks next to Cincinnati , did not get started until the early 1880 's . The manufacture of machine-tools tends to locate close to its raw materials and its market . Machine-tool plants are scattered throughout the entire American Manufacturing Belt , from Connecticut and Massachusetts to Wisconsin and Illinois , though Cincinnati and Cleveland still lead . Electrical equipment The American Manufacturing Belt produces the bulk of all electrical machinery , and Pittsburgh is one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plant , which employs about one fifth of all the secondary metal workers in the city . Cleveland , too , ranks high , with Lincoln Electric ( outstanding in the manufacture of electric welders and welding wire ) and General Electric , with its world famous laboratories at Nela-Park . Cities Pittsburgh ( 1,994,060 ) occupies a low peninsula between the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers where they converge to form the Ohio . This strategic location caused the city to become the early trading center for western Pennsylvania and the outfitting point for settlers moving into the New West . Until 1825 , the Ohio River was the major route of communication and transportation pito the trans-Appalachian region . Pittsburgh is today the world 's outstanding iron and steel center . This distinctive rank is consequent upon ( 1 ) the momentum of its early start , ( 2 ) proximity to coal fields whose fuel is superior for coking and steam , ( 3 ) excellent location astride three navigable rivers which extend north , south , and west , ( 4 ) its location at an important gateway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lake Erie ports , to which iron ore is cheaply transported , ( 6 ) nearness to important steel markets , and ( 7 ) an abundance of killed and semi-skilled labor . Waterways have been much used by Pittsburgh 's industries . ' oal is hauled by barge ( Fig. 141 ) . Much finished steel is shipped down the Ohio . Manufacturing plants are concentrated along all three rivers . lotlg as pig iron 11111 ' -t be lnn ; nde in a blast furnace , the Pittsburgh district , with its vast deposits of high-grade coking coal ac-  | cessible by improved waterways , is likely to remain a major iron and steel center . Pittsburgh is more than a great primary iron and steel center , however . Its secondary metal industries employ even more workers . Among the more important of these are the making of electrical machinery , apparatus , and supplies ( by the Westinghouse Electric &; Manufacturing Company in East Pittsburgh ) ; railroad supplies , including air brakes , switches , signals , and cars ; aluminum products made from pigs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Aluminum Company of America at New Kensington ) ; hardware of all kinds , castings , and structural shapes . Other classes of manufacturing represented include food products ( by the H. J. Heinz Company ) , paper , glass ( large plants at Arnold . Creighton , and Glassport ) , coke and by-products ( Clairton ) , chemicals , cork , clay products , and refined petroleum . The urban development , originally restricted to the limited area of flat terrace near the confluence of the rivers , has spread over much of the upland , for in areas of rough topography only the river valleys afford ample space for big mills . These of necessity then have preempted the best sites . Cleveland ( 1,214,943 ) , located at the mouth of the Cuyahoga River where steel rails meet the water 's edge with comparative ease , provides an outlet on Lake Erie for the natural lowland route from the Pennsylvania coal fields . It has an outer harbor consisting of the lake front , protected by a breakwater and given over to commerce , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devoted to manufacturing . Though founded in 1796 , Cleveland grew very slowly : in 1800 it had but 25 inhabitants ; in 1820 , 600 ; and as late as 1850 , only 17,034 . As the Middle West developed , Cleveland first became prominent when the Ohio Canal , opened in 1834 , connecting it with central and southern Ohio . As the northern terminus for the canal , the city soon became the most important trans-shipping point between t he Ohio River and Eastern markets via Lake Erie and the Hudson River . Then came the railroads ; the lake shore provided convenient transit for east-west lines , as did the Cuyahoga Valley for those from the south . After 1850 manufacturing became important . Cleveland is a city of diversified industries , but iron and steel manufacturing , concentrated irr the " Flats " of the Cuyahoga Valley , predominates . The cost of assembling raw materials for the hl.rsi furnaces is low , since iron ore and limestone are brought all the way by water . Cleveland also has a large local market for  | fabricated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Detroit area . Besides iron and steel , Cleveland has other important industries : it is the second machine-tool manufacturing city in the nation ; it ranks high in men 's and " women 's clothing , rayon , salt , clay products , Diesel engines , storage batteries , refined petroleum , motorcar parts ( all Chevrolet coach bodies are made in Cleveland ) , and paints and varnishes . Cleveland today rivals Pittsburgh as a center for the manufacture of electrical equipment . It also is an important petroleum-refining center , the work being done on the same property as when John D. Rockefeller organized the original Standard Oil Company in 1870 . At that time Cleveland was the oil capital of the world . The city is a leader in the paint and varnish industry , being the home of the Sherwin-Williams Company . This industry is one of the most highly competitive i ( r the nation , and successful operation requires that it be well located for assembling raw materials from all parts of the world and for supplying the market , though the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have unexcelled transport facilities . Akron ( 349,705 ) is located on the divide between the Lake Erie Basin and the Ohio River drainage . During Indian times , it was on the 8-mile portage path between the Cuyahoga River to the north and the Tuscarawas to the south . When the Ohio and Erie Canal was opened for traffic in 1827 , Akron , which occupied the canal summit , was guaranteed a prosperous trade . Today , as the rubber capital of the world , Akron is a city of factory workers , nearly one third of whom are immigrants or their children.51 Like that of many American industrial cities , Akron 's population has been declining . Formerly the nation 's tire production was centered in Akron , with the 3 big producers and many small ones located there . Recently the geographic trend of tire production was away from Akron ; branch factories were built in many states and in foreign countries . The city 's 2 big advantages were an early start and proximity to Detroit ; its disadvantages were constant serious labor disputes and strikes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the highest in the United States . ' In addition to rubber , Akron also manufactures breakfast foods , matches , and clay products . Youngstown ( 372,428 ) straddles the Mahoning River , which unfortunately is not navigable . This river valley is a part of the  | easiest rail route connecting Pittsburgh with the shore of Lake Erie . South of Warren all routes follow the Mahoning Valley , whose railroads carry some of the heaviest tonnage in the country ? mostly iron ore and coal . Youngstown is a city dominated by the iron and steel industry , the plants of which line the river for 20 miles ( Fig. 129 ) . Nowhere else ill North America is the local importance of this basic industry so great . Iron and steel alone account for 55 per cent of the total factory products and give the district third rank in North America . Nevertheless , Youngstown has been slipping metallurgically ? a consequence of its land-locked location . Railroad transportation of either coal or ore is so expensive in comparison with water movement that distributing and assembly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to railroad cars . Youngstown has urged the United States government to canalize the Beaver , Mahoning , and Shenango rivers , to enable it to benefit from water transportation and compete more favorably with Pittsburgh . One of the largest steel companies has overcome the district 's physical handicaps by superior management , but another is solving the problem by decentralization . Like many iron and steel districts whose plants lie along rivers , Youngstown suffers from an inadequate water supply during the drier months , even though it built Lake Milton with a capacity of 9,500,000,000 gallons against such an emergency . Steel mills utilize millions of gallons of water daily ; one of the principal uses is to cool the huge furnaces , which operate at temperatures near 2,200 ? F. From the time a gallon of water leaves Lake Milton until it leaves the plant of the Youngstown Sheet &; Tube Company , it has been used and re-used about 20 times . " Wheeling ( 196,340 ) lies on the Ohio River 90 miles below Pittsburgh at the debouchure of Wheeling Creek . Here the Ohio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The current clings o the left bank , facilitating anchorage and terminal construction . The old Cumberland or National Road which crossed the Ohio River at Wheeling had much to do with the city 's early growth . Later railroads came , among them the Baltimore &; Ohio , which followed in general the route of the National Road . With an abundance of coal and satisfactory transport facilities I ) y river and rail , Wheeling early became an important steel center . One of its chief handicaps has been a dearth of level land . Accord-Footnote  | ingly , not a single open-hearth furnace has ever been built in Wheeling . Many plants are engaged in making secondary metal products , especially tin plate . Clay products and glass , by reason of natural gas , coal , raw materials and proximity to large markets , play a significant role in the economic life of the metropolitan area . Johnstown ( 151,781 ) , at the eastern extremity of the subregion , lies some 60 miles east of Pittsburgh on the principal transportation route to the Atlantic Seaboard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days it was the head of the western branch of the Pennsylvania Canal . It is strategically situated at the confluence of 2 major tributaries of the Conemaugh River . The streams have cut through rich beds of bituminous coal , thereby stimulating coal mining and contributing to the development of the iron and steel industry . Dearth of level land has forced the city to grow up partly on the valley floors and partly on the plateau surface above , but all the mills are located in the valley . Johnstown is , industrially , a miniature Pittsburgh . Iron and steel contribute normally about three fourths of the net manufacturing value . The Bethlehem Steel Corporation employs two thirds of the wage-earners engaged in manufacturing . Canton-Massillon ( 226,996 ) , whose centers are 8 miles apart , vie for supremacy in the processing of miscellaneous steel products . Both cities are in a fertile farming area . In early days Massillon was more fortunate in being on the Ohio &; Erie Canal . Being close to coal deposits , both cities early developed important farm-implement industries . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) industry , and is a processor rather than a manufacturer of steel ; it makes mechanical tubing and cold-finished steel bars . Additional products include aluminum cooking utensils , drillers ' supplies , metal stampings , turbines , and roller bearings . The Southern Michigan Automobile Subregion The automobile subregion , including besides metropolitan Detroit-Windsor the " inner " and " outer " rings of cities ( Fig. 142 ) , contains the heart of the automotive industry . The other products made here are definitely secondary . Included in the semi-suburban inner ring are Mount Clemons , Pontiac , Ann Arbor , Ypsilanti , and Monroe . Included in the outer ring are 8 cities definitely in the orl , it of I retroit 's great industrV Flint , Lansing , Owosso , Jackson , . Adrinn , fort Huron , Toledo , ; ind  | South Bend . One of the more outstanding phases of manufacturing here is the relative unimportance of basic-materials production ? iron and steel . Figure Thus factories making parts but definitely tributary to Detroit reach out for a considerable distance . Detroit became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being the hub of a circle within which were located the pioneers of the industry , " " R. E. t ) ltls and Henry Ford . Ford developed an automobile cheap enough for all ; he developed standardization and interchangeable guts , thus making mass production possible . He raised capital among local bankers . ( Ieographic and economic conditions have justified the selection Footnote  | of Detroit as the automotive center ( Fig. 143 ) . The industry had to be strategically located with respect to steel . In the American Manufacturing Belt are concentrated 92.5 per cent of the finishedsteel producing capacity of the United States and 88 per cent of the automobile manufacturing plants . Detroit is well located for getting steel cheaply by water from South Chicago , Gary , Cleveland , Lorain , and Buffalo . If Cleveland 's pioneer inventors ? Stearns , Winton , and Gaeth ? had gone in for mass production of inexpensive cars and if Ford had done just the reverse , in all probability Cleveland and not Detroit today would be the hub of the automotive industry . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coasts , to Canada , and overseas , following the twin principles of modern relocation : first , regional plants ; and second , production in well-balanced communities where labor efficiency is high . " The industry is dominated by 3 large corporations which together supply nine tenths of the automobiles in North America and are among the world 's leading industrial corporations in size and organizational complexity . Largest of the three is General Motors Corporation which , with its subsidiaries , contributes about two fifths of the total production . In order of size following General Motors are the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation . Cities Detroit-Windsor ( 2,400,282 ) . Detroit , oldest of the lake ports , early became an important trading post . It is strategically located on the Detroit River through which traffic passes from the upper to the lower lakes and at one of the few easy crossings into Canada . It thus lies on the great'water route connecting Lake Superior iron ore and Appalachian coal ( Fig. 140 ) . Detroit grew quickly , carelessly , fantastically , and hence without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farm , hamlet , village , and town , but could not be assimilated quickly . The fluctuation of the automobile industry has always caused the population to ebb and flow , and one has the feeling that Detroit is a city of transients . Though little primary iron and steel are made there , Detroit may become a major metallurgical center , because it can assemble ravv ' materials economically and it is a major market . Detroit is industrially a young and progressive city , and is able Footnote  | to attract various types of enterprises ; for example , those making machine-tools , mechanical refrigerators , radios , and airplanes . Windsor is treated as a part of Detroit though statistically and politically it is a separate city . It is the largest automobile center in the British Empire , a situation attributable to the international boundary and to the desire of automobile manufacturers to locate Canadian branches as near as possible to Detroit . Windsor also has important salt and chemical industries based on the thick salt deposits underlying the city . In 1938 , 800,000 American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Total passenger crossings of the Detroit River by automobile exceeded 6,750,000 each way . Saginaw ? Bay City ( 153,388 ) , famous old lumber towns located on the Saginaw River near Saginaw Bay , are important producers of automobile parts for Detroit . They also make furniture and refine beet sugar . They lie in the only important coal field in Michigan , as well as in the petroleum and salt-producing area . Flint ( 188,554 ) , situated on the Flint River 70 miles northwest of Detroit , ranks next to that city in the production of automobiles . It is in the outer ring of cities . Flint is also Michigan 's thirdlargest city . The city 's industrial life centers around the Buick and Chevrolet factories . Flint was recognized as a " vehicle city " long before the era of the automobile . Lansing ( 110,356 ) , on the Grand River some 85 miles northwest of Detroit , is , like Flint , one of the outer ring of cities dominated by the motor industry . Besides being the home of the Reo and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoists , pumps , and air compressors . Lansing is also the state capital . Grand Rapids ( 209,873 ) , at the southern end of the big bend of the Grand River , is an important manufacturing center . It early benefited from water-power made available by the rapids in the river . At first it was famous as a sawmill town ; then it became t Ile furniture center of the world ; now it ranks high as a supplier of automobile parts . Furniture still leads the list of factory production , but it is much less important than in the past . Grand Rapids persists as the furniture " style center , " for styles in furniture are as fickle as those in clothing . In the early days of furniture-making , trees from the lake states supplied the timber ; today very lit t le native wood is utilized . An important furniture exhibition is held 4 times a year in enormous buildings erected for the purpose . The furniture industry brought many accessory manufacturing plants to Grand Rapids ? those making mirrors , locks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and varnishes . The automobile-parts industry is capitalizing on the skills being released by the declining furniture industry . Kalamazoo ( 77,213 ) occupies a site on the Kalamazoo River between Chicago and Detroit . Like other small cities in southern Michigan , Kalamazoo makes parts for motors ; also paper , stoves , furniture , and pharmaceuticals . It is well served by railway and highway . The city 's tributary area is important agriculturally ? being famous especially for celery , fruits , and peppermint . Toledo ( 341,663 ) , which commands the west end of Lake Erie , is not located directly on the lake but on the Maumee River near its confluence with Maumee Bay . The Maumee is the largest river flowing into the Great Lakes . Toledo is said to have the best harbor on the lakes ? certainly the most commodious . On the right bank are nearly all the facilities for handling coal and iron ore , which are the principal items outbound and inbound . Since 1929 Toledo has ranked second only to Duluth-Superior in the volume of tonnage handled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great mining areas of West Virginia , eastern Kentucky , and southeastern Ohio , and dispatched by lake carrier to Duluth , Chicago-Gary , Milwaukee , and Detroit . In fact , it handles more than two fifths of all the bituminous coal shipped from Lake Erie ports . It even claims to be the largest soft-coal port in the world . Toledo 's importance as a coal port depends upon the fact that , in the maturely dissected Appalachian Plateau , railroads must follow nature-made grooves , and in this case the groove is the Kanawha River , which flows northwest toward Toledo through the rich coal-mining region . From the Ohio Valley the tracks follow the Scioto Valley , whence they arrive in a flatter area and assume a more direct path . West Virginia today mines as much coal as Pennsylvania but is much less important industrially . Hence the bulk of its coal is sent out of the state . Toledo is the third-largest railroad center in the country . It is on the main east-west route connecting Chicago with New York ; also , four of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since early days has been a leader in the glass industry , producing containers and special glass for automobiles . It also refines petroleum , makes automobiles , and manufactures a famous brand of scales . , ' nab , Bend ( 147,022 ) , the site of an old Indian portage connecting the St. Joseph and Kankakee rivers , lies only 80 miles east of Chicago and is on the main rail routes between that city and New York . Stimulated I , y an abundance of hardwoods , its first  | great industry was the making of farm wagons and carriages . With the passing of horse-drawn vehicles , South Bend soon became an automobile-manufacturing center . Additional industries ' make sewing machines , airplane engines and parts ( best-known supplier in the continent is Bendix ) , fishing tackle , paints , varnishes , and shirts , the last industry having moved from Troy , New York , to benefit from cheap female labor . The Inland Ohio-Indiana Subregion This subregion is distinctly removed from the Great Lakes , but is strategically located with respect to the Ohio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ east and the productive farm lands to the west . Its industries are diversified ? machine-tools , cash registers , electric refrigerators , soaps , meat , tobacco , iron and steel , beer , shoes , radios , and clothing . The most important part is the Miami Valley from Piqua or Springfield to Cincinnati . Indianapolis is the major center in the western part ; Cincinnati , in the eastern . Eastern part The eastern part of the Ohio-Indiana subregion , still is important for its agriculture . In the early days farm products were so low in price they were fed to cattle and swine , which in turn were driven over the Appalachian Mountains to Baltimore . By the 1850 's Cincinnati had become so important as a meat-packing center ( called " Porkopolis " ) that it put an end to droving . The real stimulus td manufacturing was the Miami &; Erie Canal . Along its route developed a string of cities and towns which later became great centers of industry . This area is unique in that it lacks raw materials and power . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value of its manufactures , ( 2 ) an emphasis upon precision machinery , and ( 3 ) a widely ramified market . " This area has become a reservoir of skilled labor . Columbus ( 365,796 ) , unlike most capital cities , is a great manufacturing and transportation center . Columbus is located in almost the exact geographical center of Ohio . This was an allimportant factor in the location of state capitals before the days of railroads and automobiles . At the confluence of the Scioto and Olentangy rivers , Columbus lies at the eastern edge of the Corn Footnote  | Belt subregion of the Agricultural Interior in an exceedingly productive area . The city itself , which was incorporated in 1834 , has grown-in , population from 3,500 to more than 300,000 . Columbus supports a variety of manufacturing enterprises , including iron and steel , machinery , food products ( especially meatpacking ) , leather , and paper and printing . The country 's largest manufacturer of mining machinery is located here . Because of cheap fuel from near-by southeastern Ohio and West Virginia , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ County near by was a factor in Columbus ' growth . Springfield ( 77,406 ) lies in one of the richest agricultural valleys of Ohio . Its land-locked position retarded development and growth between 1815 and 1830 , forcing it to trade exclusively with a moderately prosperous local market . The Miami &; Erie Canal , which ( lid so much to develop western Ohio between Lake Erie and the Ohio River , passed by Springfield , though the prosperity brought to its tributary country was reflected in that city . Springfield , long important in industry , was by 1855 a leader in the manufacture of agricultural implements , one of its factories for a while being the largest in the world . After 1900 this industry shifted westward with the agricultural frontier ; only one plant remains . Springfield , with four well-known magazines having a combined circulation of 2,000,000 copies a month , ranks high as a magazine publishing center . Other industries include the making of automobile bumpers , gas engines , road rollers , steam boilers , and water turbines . The turbine was invented here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , owed much of its early importance to its location at the point where the old Miami &; Erie ( " anal crossed the National Road , which connected Cumberland , Maryland , with Vandalia , Illinois , and was a great highway over which products moved between the East and ' West before the advent of the railroad . Dayton lies also in a rich agricultural region . The city is a great manufacturing center and one that has been growing faster than the national average during the past three decades . Between 1919 and 1929 it ranked second in percentage of gains in industrial wage earners ? a growth attributable largely to t lie production of mechanical refrigerators. ? ' Dayton is a highly specialized industrial center making primarily consumers ' goods , of which the most important are mechanical refrigerators ( invented Footnote  | in the Miami Valley ) , computing machines , cash registers , lighting systems , and airplane parts . Wright Field near Dayton was named for the inventors of the airplane , who , after their successful flight at Kitty Hawk in North Carolina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aviation industry . Wright Field is the Army aviation proving ground . Here also were developed the earth-induction compass , radio beam , blind-flying instruments , and modern aerial photography . Hamilton-Middletown ( 112,686 ) , which lie 10 miles apart the highly fertile Miami Valley , were early favored by productive farms and the Miami Canal , and are today famous for their iron and steel industry . As small cities they are unique among American metallurgical districts , because the trend of industry for a century was toward concentrating factories and financial resources in large cities . Moreover , they do not benefit from location on a navigable waterway for securing raw materials or distributing finished products . Their advantages lie in important patent rights , ' efficient opertions , and more satisfied labor than is to be found elsewhere . This last factor no doubt is a result of location in smaller cities withbetter living conditions for the working man . The district is unusual in that its blast furnaces'and coke ovens are in Hamilton and its steel mills in Middletown . Blast furnaces usually adjoin steel plants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of delivering pig iron in a molten state , the company devised a ladle car with a capacity of 150 tons which is taken by rail from Hamilton to Middletown ( Fig. 144 ) . This district ranks among the leaders in production of sheet steel and tin plate . Cincinnati ( 789,309 ) , strategically situated on the northernmost point of the great bend of the Ohio River near its junction with the Miami , opposite Licking Valley in Kentucky , became an outstanding river town when the Ohio was one of the country 's great commercial highways . In fact , in 1850 , next to New Orleans , it was the chief city of the West . The deep channel and the favorable river bank helped Cincinnati to become a great commercial center during the steamboat era . Its history is inextricably bound up wit It that of the river . In 1832 Cincinnati was connected by canal wit II Toledo near Lake Erie , enabling it to secure products for its breweries , flour mills , and packing houses . As agriculture moved westward , industries using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as meat-packing industries , tended to desert Cincinnati for Chicago and other cities near the Great Plains . As steel rails superseded the river and canal , Cincinnati , especially after ltic . ) O , became a slow-growing city . Cincinnati ranks as at leading industrial center especially in the production of clothing , machine-tools , playing cards , radios , shoes , soap , and textbooks . 11 is the machine-tool center of the world and  | alone contributes one third of Ohio 's tremendous output . Its Procter &; Gamble plant at Ivorydale covers 11 acres and is one of the largest soap-manufacturing plants in the world . Western part As in the eastern part of the Ohio-Indiana subregion , agri ulture in the western part remains important . Nevertheless , mahufacturing is outstanding . The leading products are agricultural implements , chemicals , glass , automobile parts , electrical machinery , steel forgings , pharmaceuticals , hosiery ; airplane accessory parts , engines , and propellers ; and wood products , particularly furniture . Flour-milling , meat-packing , and vegetable-canning are especially outstanding . Indiana is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early as 1861 . Madison County alone has 43 canneries . More than 100,000 acres are devoted to tomatoes alone in this state . At Elwood is held an annual pageant in honor of the tomato . Other vegetables that are canned include corn , kidney beans , pumpkin , and cabbage ( sauerkraut ) . Indianapolis ( 455,357 ) is the largest city in Anglo-America not located on a navigable waterway ? ocean , lake , river , or canal . While it is centrally situated ? a locational asset for a state capital ? it has little or no local geographic advantage . It developed as an important crossroads for trunk-line railroads connecting Pittsburgh and Buffalo with St. Louis and Chicago . Dominating a trade territory within a radius of about 100 miles , its industries are typically concerned with the needs of the agricultural u ? nlan.d . It is near the eastern interior ( the Indiana Illinois ) coal field ( Fig. 63 ) . Fort Wayne ( 134,385 ) , at the head of the Maumee River , is an important manufacturing center . In 1815 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its rapid growth in early days , however , was the result of economic activity brought about by the Wabash-Maumee Canal . When steel rails superseded the artificial waterway , Fort Wayne became an important railway center . Among its more important industrial products are electrical equipment , castings , airplane engines and accessories , machinery , and automobile part s . Other cities With only two metropolitan districts in this part of the subregion , one might minimize its industrial importance . There are , however , a large number of small cities whose variety and combined l 01111 ) 111 . of manufactured products are very great ? Huntington , Peru , Marion ,  | Kokomo , Elwood , Muncie , Anderson , Newcastle , Richmond , Con , nersville , and Shelbyville . The Chicago-Milwaukee District The Chicago-Milwaukee district occupies the western and southwestern shore of Lake Michigan from Gary to Manitowoc and includes satellite towns and cities extending a short distance inland . Heavy industry predominates , South Chicago-Gary constituting the best-balanced primary metallurgical district in North America and the one that threatens ultimately to displace the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , refine oil , and make electrical equipment , airplane engines and accessories , agricultural implements , railway cars , automobiles and trucks , clothing and shoes . Most manufacturing in Wisconsin and Illinois is confined to this subregion . Chicago is the economic capital of this subregion , as well as of the entire Middle West . Meat-packing Meat-packing and the manufacture of corn products , though more important in Chicago than in any other North American city , are treated in Chapter XII , " The Agricultural Interior , " because of their close association with agriculture . Petroleum-refining Whiting , Indiana , which lies in the Chicago Metropolitan area , is one of the 3 largest refining and storage centers in the American Manufacturing Belt , most of the major oil-producing companies being represented . When Whiting began to refine oil , proximity to market was the major locational factor , and only crude oil was pumped through pipelines . The increasing use of pipelines for transporting gasoline during the past decade , however , has resulted in a shift of refining activity to the oil fields , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation 's total . Iron and steel Chicago-Gary , comprising one of the outstanding manufacturing districts of the world , is strategically located for making iron and steel , for iron ore and limestone can be brought directly to the blast furnaces by lake carrier , and coal is not far distant in southern Illinois , though some coking fuel is brought in from West Virginia and Kent in ky . This ( list ric t has the best balance between produc-  | tion and consumption of any iron and steel area in the United States . With the removal of " Pittsburgh Plus , " 5J it almost equals Pittsburgh in production . In fact it did equal it in 1934 . Gary is one of the few examples of a scientifically planned industrial location . For more than 30 years ' its metallurgical industry has been built up step by step . In 1905 the United States Steel Corporation needed a new plant to serve the rapidly growing Midwestern market . What is now Gary was then an area of sand dunes and swamps . Its intermediate location between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deposits enables this area to assemble its three raw materials economically . Gary 's location with respect to markets is unsurpassed . Near enough to deal conveniently with Chicago 's manufactories , it is at the same time far enough away to escape high land values and ruinous taxes . Labor is plentiful . Cold , clear water of good quality is available from Lake Michigan . The terrain is level and there is plenty of room for industrial and residential expansion . Moreover , the soil is sandy and unproductive , and consequently land is cheap . Furniture The plentiful supply of lumber of the Great Lakes area gave rise to an important furniture industry . Chicago still ranks first in the manufacture and distribution of furniture . Agricultural implements Because agricultural implements are bulky and heavy , they should be made as close to market as possible . The industry has , therefore , migrated westward with the agricultural frontier ? from western New York through Ohio and Indiana to Chicago , which is now the world center in this industry . Cities Chicago ( 4,499,126 ) is so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact the whole Agricultural Interior has been called Footnote  | Chicago 's hinterland . Without this hinterland , Chicago could not be the city it has become . Chicago is located near the southern end of Lake Michigan where the Great Lakes system dips deepest into the heart of American agriculture . J. Paul Goode enthusiastically claimed that Chicago was born great , that it inherited a " generous list of geographic advantages and was destined from the beginning to play a great role . " s ? The specific site of Chicago , like that of sister cities on the Great Lakes , was determined , by a river ? in this case the small , inconsequential Chicago River , which provided protection for lake boats . Chicago has grown sensationally . Whereas a century ago it was merely a remote and inconspicuous trading post , its population has increased a hundredfold since 1850 . Today the city proper has 3,396,808 ; the metropolitan area , 4,499,126 . It is now the greatest receiving , distributing , and manufacturing center in the Middle West . No city on earth has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope to rival it in this respect . The city grew primarily during the era of east-west trade development . Its preeminence in transportation is derived from the fact that it lies near the southern tip of Lake Michigan , which extends 330 miles in a northsouth direction , diverting all northwest , west , and east rail.lines around its southern end . Thirty-three trunk lines which radiate to all parts of the country have their terminals at Chicago . Had there been no lake , the route between the Northwest and the North Atlantic coast would have been considerably north of Chicago . The building of railroads and roads has been greatly facilitated by the flat terrain of the Chicago region . Milwaukee ( 790,336 ) lies on Lake Michigan at the mouths of three small rivers 85 miles north of Chicago . Because of its propinquity to Chicago , which dominates the entire Midwest , Milwaukee never will be able to capitalize on its favorable commercial location . The rivers are navigable and the harbor , one of the best on the lakes , is capable of accommodating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? especially grain and coal . Moreover , it dominates the commercial activities of all but the northwestern part of Wisconsin . Nevertheless , Milwaukee is classed as an industrial city , and to manufacturing it owes most of its growth . A city of diversified industries , its plants make Footnote  | products ranging from farm implements to silk hose and from beer to shoes . Especially important are its heavy machinery industries ? those producing cranes , hoists , steam shovels , excavators , ore crushers , mining equipment , and agricultural implements . Racine-Kenosha ( 135,075 ) , on Lake Michigan between Milwaukee and Chicago , benefit industrially from this location because their automobile plants have easy access to steel mills whence they can procure sheets , strips , and bars . The St. Louis District The St. Louis District has its center in the city of St. Louis ( mostly in Missouri but partly in Illinois ) . It is the largest city between Chicago and the Pacific Coast and is one of North America 's leading centers of diversified industry . Especially does it exert strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ location enabled St. Louis to dominate much of the river trade ( luring the steamboat era . The city later became a railway center , ranking second only to Chicago . The metropolitan district , which includes East St. Louis , Alton , Bellville , and Granite City , contributes heavily to the nation 's total output of shoes , beer , meat , electrical equipment , airplane engines and accessories , chemicals , alumina , glass , refined petroleum ( the towns of Wood River and Roxarra ) , and iron and steel . St. Louis ( 1,367,977 ) , lying on the first high ground south of the mouth of the Missouri and near the confluence of the Ohio and Illinois with the Mississippi , started as a fur-trading and outfitting point for trappers and traders . It is still an important river town ; many tugs and barges are to be seen at the riverside . The railroads have made it a great distributing and manufacturing center . In the early days St. Louis was a gateway to the Far West , as Pittsburgh was to the Middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towns and cities clustered about the confluence of the Mississippi and Missouri rivers . The terrain consists of broad , flat bottom troughs separating smooth , undulating uplands . It is a major manufacturing center . The Montreal , Ottawa , Three Rivers District The Montreal , Ottawa , Three Rivers district , widely separated from the Buffalo , Niagara Falls , Erie , Hamilton , Toronto subregion , is Canada 's outstanding industrial area . All hut Iwo of Ilse I ) oncinion 's manufacturing cities and all of its distinctly industrial  | ones are located in these two subregions . Located at a crossroads where the Ottawa , St. Maurice , and Champlain valleys meet the St. Lawrence , this subregion is the heart of the entire St. Lawrence Valley . Half the total trade of Canada passes through it , and many exports and imports are processed or manufactured there . Cheap hydro-power , an abundant supply of intelligent labor at a reasonable price differential , a rapidly growing market , a good supply of industrial water , and ample room for the establishment of new and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more interested in manufacturing than in shipping . Its chief industries are engaged in the production of flour , pulp and paper , textiles , shoes , sugar , chemicals , gasoline , railway equipment , lumber , aluminum , and cement . Many of these industries , of course , could not exist if it were not for the tariff on products made south of the border . Only the cement industry needs coal , and this is delivered cheaply by water . The combination of raw materials , low-cost power , and access to markets is certain to make this area one of the great industrial and distributing centers of the world . The pulp and paper industry is mentioned specifically because it is so important along the north shore of the St. Lawrence between Montreal and Quebec ( Fig. 22 ) . This area 's principal advantages are the navigability of the St. Lawrence , which enables deep-draft vessels to bring raw materials to the mills and take manufactured products to the markets of the world , and the location of many mills at the mouths of streams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lawrence ) , down which logs are cheaply driven and on which huge and economical water-power is developed ( Fig. 161 ) . Occupying such a location is Three Rivers , which is said to be the world 's leading pulp and paper manufacturing center ( Fig. 165 ) . Montreal ( 890,234 ) , by virtue of its position on an island at the head of navigation for large steamers , and at a point where the St. Lawrence is most easily bridged , is the logical junction for North America 's lake and river traffic . It eclipsed Quebec in importance when ocean navigation was extended farther upstream to its docks . Montreal is also a crossroads where the Champlain and Ottawa valleys meet the St. Lawrence . As a port for the greatest wheat lands of the world , Montreal has warehouses and grain elevators with enormous capacities . The city is one of the Dominion 's leading manufacturing centers with important flour , iron and steel , pulp and paper mills , clothing and textile indust lies , and sugar refineries.  | The greatest expansion in population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one tenth of the Dominion 's inhabitants . Nearly two thirds of the total population is FrenchCanadian . Ottawa ( 150,861 ) , on the broad Ottawa River , is known mainly as a political city ? the Dominion capital . It is also the center of Canada 's pulp and paper industry ; numerous large timber rafts are floated down the Gateneau and other rivers from logging camps in the coniferous forests of the Laurentian Shield . The hiss of steel teeth biting into logs is a common sound in Ottawa . The lumber mills procure cheap hydro-power from the Chondiere Falls near by . Three Rivers ( 41,811 ) , an important Canadian port of entry , is situated at the confluence of the St. Maurice and the St. Lawrence rivers 78 miles southwest of Quebec and 92 miles northeast of Montreal . It is served by both the Canadian Pacific and the Canadian National railways . Founded by Champlain in 1634 , it is one of Quebec 's oldest towns . By reason of its relation to the enormous water-power of the St. Maurice River , Three Rivers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a large lumber trade . Summary of the Manufacturing Region and Its Subregions Each of the principal subregions in the American Manufacturing Belt , whose cities are predominantly industrial , has now been presented . This does not mean , of course , that manufacturing within this main belt is confined exclusively to these areas , for there are within it many small , relatively isolated industrial districts . There are also some industrial districts just outside the regional boundaries . Examples of these are the Ironton district , the Lower Wabash Valley , the bridge cities ? Evansville ( Indiana ) and Paducah ( Kentucky ) ? on the lower Ohio , the Rock River cities , the Fox River district , and Berlin ( New Hampshire ) . All are manufacturing centers in essentially nonindustrial areas . The relative unimportance in manufacturing of much of the northern Appalachian coal field is possibly the result.of unsatisfactory ' railway facilities through the mountains . But even here there is considerable manufacturing in isolated centers . All in all , the subregions comprise a region where manufacturing dominates , and no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their factories lie relatively close together . The  | American Manufacturing Belt is indisputably North America 's industrial workshop . 4 . TRANSPORTATION In a region where manufacturing is predominant , cities numerous , and population dense , transportation must be superior . The American Manufacturing Belt has an unsurpassed network of railways , highways , airways , and waterways that bind it together and link it with other regions ( Fig. 123 ) . Some significant changes in the relative importance of the several types of transportation took place during the depression of the 1930 's . Railroad transportation declined in relative importance , whereas that by motor gained . That by pipeline declined while that by water gained . ' Ocean Transportation Brief reference must suffice for this topic since New York , Baltimore , Philadelphia , and Boston have already been treated and it was seen that as port cities they all excel . All are connected with the far corners of the earth and all have ready access to the food , industrial raw materials , and markets of interior Anglo-America . The Great Lakes The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world . For 1,700 miles they extend in an eastwest direction , connecting the great raw-materials producing Central Northwest with the fuel , industries , and markets of the East . Few barriers to navigation now exist between Duluth and Montreal . The lakes seldom experience severe storms , but they are closed by ice normally from December to May . The shores of the lakes are dotted with great industrial and commercial cities . Most of the traffic consists of bulky products ? iron ore , coal , wheat , and limestone . These are handled economically by specially designed boats capable of carrying enormous cargoes . Speedy loading and unloading facilities have been installed at the ports ( Figs. 145 and 146 ) . The Great Lakes ? St. Lawrence Seaway For some years this project , has been widely discussed throughout both the United Stases and Canada . It would link the Great Footnote  | Lakes and the St. Lawrence River with the Atlantic , permitting ocean-going ships to penetrate the continent 2,350 miles to Duluth . It would also provide an abundance of hydro-power . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seaway received a majority vote in the United States Senate , but failed to be ratified Wellman Engineering Cu . Figure because a two-thirds vote was required . As a result of World War II , the issue is again before the people . Said President Franklin D. Roosevelt in December 1940 : Seacoast shipyards are already overtaxed with uncompleted construction . Shipyards on the Great Lakes with access to the ocean yet close to the some ( s of supply of labor , raw and finished material , further removed from possible attack may be a vital factor in the successful defense of this continent . To complete the seaway , specified channels would have to be dredged to a depth of 27 feet and locks would have io lie conslrueted to by-pas certain sections ( Fig. 117 ) . //  | Since the greater part of the seaway is on the international boundary , Canada and the United States must agree on a plan before work is begun . The estimated cost is $655,372,000 , of which $324,771,000 would be paid by the United States , $240,601,000 by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New York State Power Authority . " Statistics are used effectively by both proponents and critics of the project . This much is undeniable ? the cost would be enormous and the waterway could be used only during 42 per cent of the year . Figure  | Rivers Rivers were the great highways of colonial days , having been used whenever possible in preference to the hard and slow overland routes . Their chief advantages as highways were low cost and convenience . Many a stream that now seems too small or shallow to have served was very extensively used , and many a settlement would have died out had there been no stream over which to float products to market . All large western communities in the period 1800 to 1850 were located on the Ohio or the Mississippi . Steamboats on the rivers were of outstanding importance until about 1860 , when they were largely replaced by railroads , which could make trips in a quarter of the time . T-he Detroit ( a link in the Great Lakes system ) , Monongahela , Ohio , Great Kanawha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rivers of the American Manufacturing Belt . Most important are the first three . The Detroit River The Detroit River , which drains Lake St. Clair into Lake Erie , is 28 miles long and 1/2 to 3 miles wide . A shoal that formerly blocked its entrance from Lake St. Clair has been cut through . About three fourths of the tonnage moving down the lakes passes through the Detroit River ? more than moves through the Suez and Panama canals combined . The Monongahela River The Monongahela , a deeply entrenched river , is unique in two respects : ( 1 ) it is the most used in North America , averaging more than 20,000,000 tons per annum , and ( 2 ) it is one of the few important streams flowing northward . Because the Monongahela , which flows through an area richly endowed in coal , focuses upon Pittsburgh , the world 's leading iron and steel center , and because it was handicapped by annual drought and floods , it was the first river in the United States to be improved for navigation . Canalization of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locks for passage of boats ( Fig. 148 ) . These improvements have overcome the natural handicap of low water in late summer and autumn and of floods in spring . Before unprovenients were made , only rafts and boats of one-foot draft could navigate it . Today it is navigable from Fairmont , West Virginia , to Pittsburgh .  | Pittsburgh 's principal competitive advantage in the iron and steel industry is the low-cost barge transportation on coking coal from river tipples to by-product coking plants without trans-shipment ( Fig. 141 ) . The Ohio River The channel of the Ohio River was not navigable during the droughts of late summer until the federal government established a permanent 9-foot stage with a system of more than 50 movable dams which back the water into a succession of pools deep enough for navigation . Locks permit the boats to get around the dams . The Ohio accordingly has become one of the continent 's leading carriers of freight . Thousands of commodious barges , shackled tows , are propelled over the river at all seasons , except for several days in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when ice is objectionable ( Fig. 149 ) . The tonnage is several times greater now than it was at the height of the steamboat period . Ninetyfive per cent of the total freight consists of bulky products ? coal , coke , ore , sand and gravel , stone , grain , pig iron , and steel . Increasing quantities of gasoline are being shipped . Most of the traffic is in - the hands of contract and private carriers . The Mississippi River The Mississippi , while a transportation artery of some importance , suffers the handicap of flowing in the wrong direction ? from north to south rather than from west to east , the main direction of traffic . It suffers further from sand bars and snags , and from having a channel that is not uniformly deep . Except for the part of the river below St. Louis , most of the commerce is of only local importance and contributes little to national production and distribution . The Illinois River This stream is formed by the joining of the Des Plaines and Kankakee rivers and enters the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It has a depth of 9 feet from its mouth to l ' t ica . It , forms , with the Sanitary and Ship Canal and other rivers , a continuous waterway across the state of Illinois which joins Luke NIichi ! gan and the 11lississippi . A considerable tonnage of bull : ' products passes over its waters .  | The Hudson River The Hudson River reaches the Atlantic Ocean at New York City , where it is called the North River . It is tidal up to Albany . It is used by barges , tows of which move over its waters laden especially with crushed stone , bricks , cement , and lumber . Large numbers of tankers carry gasoline from seaboard refineries to Great Lakes cities ; other craft carry refined sugar , returning with automobile parts and iron and steel . The Hudson River channel , including the west side of Manhattan and the adjacent New Jersey side , comprises the most important part of the Port of New York , handling 50 per cent by value of the business . Canals Space forbids adequate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Though most of them proved inadequate , particularly because they were closed by ice for several months each year , they did , nevertheless , play a vital role during the decades when people depended primarily upon inland water transportation . Canals were built to connect natural waterways . The famous " Soo " Canals are discussed in Chapter XIV , pp. 530 ? 531 ; those inland from Atlantic ports , in Chapter VII , pp. 163 ? 165 . Abandoned canals ( Fig. 150A ) will not be discussed . Among the outstanding canals in this region today are ( Fig. 150B ) the Welland , the New York State Barge , the Chicago Sanitary &; Ship , 4nd the Chesapeake &; Delaware . The Welland Canal Most important in this region is the Welland Canal , built to avoid Niagara Falls and connecting Port Colborne on Lake Erie with Port Weller on Lake Ontario . First built in 1829 , it was a tortuous ditch with 25 locks . Nevertheless , it did a tremendous business and during the boom grain year of 1928 handled 131,531 , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which constitute about 90 per cent of those on the lakes , could not navigate the canal ; cargoes had to be unloaded at Port Colborne , the Canadian terminal harbor 25 miles west of Buffalo , and placed aboard smaller ships . These required about 16 hours to make the trip , against 8 hours today . The greater economy and efficiency attained by larger lake vessels led to a desire to enlarge the canal ; the work was begun in 1913 and completed in 1931 . The new  |p465  Welland Canal can handle any ship on the lakes . Whereas the old canal had 25 locks , the new one has but 7 . Though 30 miles long , it has few curves and no bad ones . New York State Barge ( Erie ) Canal This canal , which connects Lake Erie with the Hudson River was opened in 1825 . It follows the only practical route through the Appalachian barrier ? the Mohawk Gap and the Ontario Plain . Freight rates between Buffalo and New York immediately dropped from $100 to $5 per ton and the transit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Erie Canal , probably more than any other single factor , made New York City the greatest port on the Atlantic Coast . Traffic from the interior poured into New York Harbor . The Erie was financially successful , and it was the busiest inland waterway in the world for many years . In 1875 , however , its traffic was surpassed by the railway . Tolls were abolished in 1883 , but this was a temporary solution . By 1895 the tonnage fell to 3,500,000 as against 19,000,000 for its competing railroad . The solution appeared to be a larger canal ? the New York State Barge Canal , which was completed in 1918 . It followed the route of its predecessor most of the way . It is 353 miles long from Buffalo to Waterford ( near Troy ) on the Hudson . But the canal is a disappointment . It is used only by self-propelled vessels or tows propelled by them . Traffic has been increasing in recent years but only slowly . The leading commodities transported are grain , sand , stone and gravel , sulphur , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unused , primarily because of ( 1 ) the absence of common carriers , ( 2 ) lack of traffic agreements with the railroads , and ( 3 ) the effects of ice in winter . The Chicago Sanitary &; Ship Canal ? A link in the Illinois Waterway System As early as 1673 the explorers Joliet and Marquette spoke of the : 1 ( 1 vantage of a canal that would connect the Illinois and Des Plaines II ers with the Chicago River . Construction on the Illinois &; NIiehigan Canal was not begun until 1836 , however , and it was not open for traffic until 1848 . The waterway was 6 feet deep , 48 feet ide , and 97 miles long . It connected the South Branch of the ' hieago River , about 7 miles from Lake Michigan , with the Illinois Uiver at 1. a Salle . Fed iii part by Chicago River water , it also aided in solving ( ' Iiie:igo 's sewage problem , which had been critical , mice no current could crony the urine away from the dead end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level of this canal in order to reduce the pollution of the lake . In 1911 the Chicago Drainage Canal , which paralleled its predecessor to Joliet , was opened . Since it had a depth of 21 feet , it soon drew away all through traffic from the old canal . The old Illinois &; Michigan Canal flourished for about 20 years until railway competition became too severe . Despite paucity of traffic , this canal did not experience the fate of most others because of its strategic position between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi . In the 1920 's the Illinois Waterway System was further improved , and it is now a 9-foot barge waterway from Lake Michigan . to the Illinois River . Traffic is definitely increasing . The Chesapeake &; Delaware Canal The Chesapeake &; Delaware Canal ( Fig. 150B ) , connecting the Delaware River on the east with an arm of Chesapeake Bay on the west , is 19 miles long and 27 feet deep . It was completed in 1829 , thus providing an all-water route from Philadelphia to ' Baltimore . Tideless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Intracoastal Waterway , which has been owned and operated by the United States government since 1919 . Accommodating all but the very largest ocean-going vessels , it shortens the route from Baltimore to Philadelphia by 316 miles . Traffic has increased steadily and greatly since 1929 , the chief items handled being petroleum products , ores , metals and their manufactures , chemicals , lumber , and vegetable food products . Railroads Though the United States has but 6 per cent of the world 's population and 5 per cent of its area , it has nearly one third of the railroad mileage . Most cities in the United States developed simultaneously with railroads ; 73 per cent of all rail traffic terminates in urban areas . As early as the 1850 's , far-seeing men felt certain that the West would be developed by railroads rather than b rivers and canals . By 1860 railroads had triumphed over inland waterways , and since then port rivalries have been expressed in the competition of the railroads serving them . The American Manufacturing Belt has a real rail web ? the - most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than half the passengers and tonnage handled by all American railroads . This volume of traffic is attributable to the fact tlinI so large a part of the population dwells iii the 1I auiifacturnI kelt that most  |p467  of the products of the farm , the mine , and the factory must be consumed there . Most of the lines run east and west . In this region no one , be he an inhabitant of a city , town , village , hamlet , or farm , is more than a few miles from a railway . Highways The roads of the colonies were little more than cleared paths and were made mostly for local traffic . Toll roads were built by private companies between 1790 and 1840 . The federal government began construction on the National Road in 1811 , opening it in 1817 . Since then this nation , but more particularly the American Manufacturing Belt , has been spider-webbed with roads , because hardsurface highways and heavy traffic are synonymous with dense population and high productivity . Without automobiles and motor trucks speeding over the roads day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food . Trucks benefit from low capacities and high speed and can , therefore , provide frequent shipments at low cost . They also have a distinct advantage over railroads in short hauls . As yet they have played only a small part in long-distance transportation . Trucks have been a potent factor in decentralizing industry . Unfortunately the highway system in the region under discussion is glutted with bottlenecks , especially in and around cities . liy-passes , parkways , and turnpikes are relieving the congestion in metropolitan highway systems . A single outstanding example is 1 he Merritt Parkway from Westchester almost to New Haven , by which for ten cents a car may sweep over the Connecticut Hills for : i2 miles at sustained speed and safety and with only one stop . Entrance highways into New York City from the west are marvels of efficiency . The Pennsylvania Turnpike is discussed on page 193 . Pipelines Crude oil and gasoline Petroleum , when first discovered , was transported in barrels by wagons , and somewhat later by railroads . As production skyrocketed , a new method of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pipeline resulted . Pipeline routes have been chosen with great care ? often with the aid of aerial surveys . Sharp valleys , ridges , and rivers are avoided whenever possible , and even soil , climate , and vegetation are considered . The routes usually go directly to their destinations except , when skirting urban centers.  |p468  The American Manufacturing Belt has attracted many of the trunk pipelines from the Mid-Continent Province to refining and marketing centers on the Great Lakes , the Mississippi River , and the Atlantic Seaboard , and from the Appalachian Province to refineries on the Atlantic Coast ( Fig. 123 ) . Formerly only crude oil was shipped , and this still is largely the case . Recently , however , gasoline pipelines have been constructed from the Mid-Continent area to the Great Lakes , from the Atlantic Seaboard to the Great Lakes , and from the California fields to markets . The Great Lakes Pipeline , the longest in North America , was built by the producing and refining interests of the Southwest to retrieve the markets in the Middle West , which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now firmly entrenched as a part of the American transportation system , is superior to any other land device for handling liquids , though it can not compete in cost with the ocean tanker or the fresh-water barge . The ton-mile cost of shipping bulk petroleum is 8.3 mills by rail , 3.2 mills by pipeline and 1.25 mills by tank vessel.Gt The chief advantages of pipelines , in addition to the low cost of transporting the oil , are that ( 1 ) movement is continuous , ( 21 there is no problem of the return of empty equipment , and ( 3 ) rights of way are relatively inexpensive . Natural gas Much natural gas , frequently associated with the oil industry , has blown off and been wasted . That in the East Texas , West Texas , and Oklahoma City pools amounted to uncounted billions of cubic feet . In the first half of the nineteenth century , some natural gas was piped in New York State and Pennsylvania . After 1870 much of it was piped in Ohio and Pennsylvania . Formerly the movement was largely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from West Virginia . More recently Oklahoma , Texas , California , and Louisiana have become the leading centers , with lesser ones in Montana and Wyoming . In 1937 pipelines carried 687 billion cubic feet of gas across state lines , of which 67 per cent emanated from Texas , Louisiana , awl West Virginia . Illinois and Ohio are regularly the most import ant consumers of natural gas . Footnote  |p469  Air Transportation In 1941 , for the entire country , 358 planes were used by commercial companies and these carried 4,500,000 passengers and 22 , - 500,000 pounds of express . The distance flown was 150,000.000 miles . The great size of the United States and Canada , along with the demand for speedy transportation , stimulated the rapid growth of airways particularly since 1930 . Airline routes of the United States and Canada are confined to fairly well defined lines of travel , since they connect leading cities and depend upon ground aids . The natural environment of the region over which planes fly has much influence on weather conditions and hence on safety . Especially is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , heavy rain and snow , thunderstorms , surface winds , and upper winds . It is indeed significant that topography has exerted little influence in the laying out of airlines . The concentration of traffic is greatest along routes between New York and Washington , New York and Boston , New York and Chicago , and Chicago and St. Louis . The service here is much more frequent than in the South and West . Roughly speaking about 70 per cent of the nation 's entire air traffic originated and GO per cent was received in the American Manufacturing Belt . ' 5 . AGRICULTURE WITHIN THE REGION En the American Manufacturing Belt , most of the agriculture is of the city-supporting type , providing factory workers with perishable foodstuffs such as fluid milk , eggs , fruits , and vegetables . In other regions cities exist to serve near-by farms ; in this region farms exist to serve near-by cities.ss There is a localization of farm types around the urban centers ? first , market gardening , then whole-milk dairying and poultry raising , butterfat dairying , livestock feeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agriculture of the northern and eastern parts of the region consists primarily of dairying , crop specialties ( fruits , vegetables , and tobacco ) , and mixed farming . Footnote  |p470  Dairying Some of the leading dairying areas of North America are concentrated in this region because of ( 1 ) plentiful hay and pasture , ( 2 ) soils insufficiently productive to grow cereals in competition with the states farther west , ( 3 ) cool climate and short growing season , which are favorable for hay and pasture but not for most crops , and ( 4 ) rough terrain ( in some areas ) ill-suited to the extensive use of machinery . The large amount of hay , silage , and manufactured feeds supplies the basis for an economical dairy ration . Finally , . the proximity of the area to the important population centers insures a steady demand . The greater the city , the greater is the distance to the outer edge of its milkshed ? the source of its fluid milk supply . Thus New York secures the bulk of its milk by fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Buffalo , and Columbus , however , rely exclusively , and Detroit , Pittsburgh , Baltimore , and Chicago largely , on transportation by motor truck . Special tanks and refrigerator bodies are used in hauling milk . One area , the St. Lawrence Lowland , converts much of its milk into cheese , for its own population is not sufficiently large to absorb the heavy production as fluid milk , and the New York City and New England markets are not available by reason of the international boundary ( tariff ) and distance . Mixed Farming One fourth of the nation 's crop of dry edible beans , as well as large amounts of potatoes and sugar beets , are produced in southern Michigan . All are well suited to the light soil and the short growing season . The St. Lawrence Lowland between Montreal and Quebec is quit level , and mixed farming is important there . Vegetables , fruits , and cereals are grown for local consumption , along with such fodder crops as barley , hay , and mangels . Fruits Orchards and vineyards are very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lake Erie shore of Ohio , New York , and Pennsylvania , in the Niagara Peninsula of Ontario , on the southern shore of Lake Ontario , and in the Finger Lakes district of New York . Most orchards and vineyards are placed on slopes to  |p471  benefit from air and soil drainage , or on the lee sides of lakes , which ameliorate the temperatures . Fruit is commercialy unimportant where late spring and early fall frosts prevail . For this reason more than any other , important fruit areas adjoin large bodies of water , such as Lakes Michigan , Erie , and Ontario ( Fig. 151 ) . Welch Grape Juice Co . Figure Vegetables Market gardening ? the growing of vegetables for sale in near-by lies ? characterizes the environs of every metropolitan area . Culivntion is very intensive .

In the Cleveland area old ridges ? shorelines of former ial lakes are widely used for t his I ) urlrose , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on sloping lands closer to the lake are devoted to vineyards . Growing of vegetables on muck soils . Four types of soils have exerted tremendous influence on the distribution of the continent 's vegetable industry . One of these , black muck , occurs in the general area about the Great Lakes in northern Indiana , Illinois , Michigan , Minnesota , New York , Ohio , and Wisconsin . Muck soils lie primarily in glaciated areas ? in depressions where lakes and swamps formerly existed or about the margins of existing lakes . Their suitability for growing vegetables was discovered by Hollanders in southwest Michigan near Kalamazoo . Such soils when reclaimed are especially suited to celery , onions , mint , lettuce , cabbage , and potatoes . The growing of vegetables on muck is as localized as the distribution of the soil . The most prosperous districts are those located near large population centers . Growing vegetables under glass . The south shore of Lake l ; rio between Ashtabula and Toledo is the continent 's center of gl:rsw covered farms . Vegetables are grown during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is expensive to build greenhonse and heat them . Approximately $28,000 is required to place rut acre of land under glass , and 200 to 500 tons of coal are burned t maintain this acre at a suitable temperature for the season . Commercial growing of vegetables began in this area about 181 but has reached its present proportions mostly since 1915 ( Fig. 152 ) The Cleveland area , with 10 million dollars invested in some 27 acres , is the only one in the United States where new greening ' are being built . Individual growers have as many as 10 acres u n I glass . For the most part the glasshouse industry competes sueec. fully with the same crops grown in warmer parts of the count ' because of higher yields , superior quality , and nearness to nr:rrl , e Head lettuce is an exception , however , little being grown now cause of the superior product and low price of that from 1 he I ri perial Valley 2,000 to 3,000 miles from large markets .

Most glasshouse farmers grow additional crops of celery , corn , carrots , beets , and beans out of doors in summer . The chief advantages of the Lake Erie shore for this enterprise are central location with respect to the larger consuming centers ( which means lower transport costs ) and proximity to sources of glass , steel , and fuel . Tomatoes , the principal crop , are superior to Courtesy of " rubacc ? Figure those sent from great distances because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 ) can be marketed within a few hours after they are picked , and ( 3 ) are free from attacks by insects and diseases , by reason of careful control . Tobacco The Connecticut Valley , especially the lower central part. , is d leading tobacco-growing area . Five sixths of the crop is of the cigar-binder type and one sixth is Sumatra . The value of thn latter , however , is almost equal to that of the first . Sumatra tohaeeo is grown under shade ( 1 ' ' ig . I. 1l ; this result .  |p475  in a thinner leaf with less gum and little damage from wind and hail . Much of it is grown by large corporations whose scientific methods are not surpassed anywhere . Because tobacco is grown on the same land continuously , liberal applications of commercial fertilizer must be used to insure satisfactory yields . The Outlook It has been noted that the American Manufacturing Belt ( Fig. 126 ) in 1940 had approximately 45 per cent of the total population of the United States and 28 per cent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had 46 per cent of the metropolitan areas and 51 per cent of the cities of 5,000 or more inhabitants in the United States . It had 50 per cent of Canada 's greater cities . In addition , the American Manufacturing Belt provided 70 per cent of the wage jobs and contributed about 65 per cent of the manufactured products of the United States . In short , this relatively small region contains a disproportionate share of North America 's population , metropolitan areas , cities , manufacturing plants , and wealth . It is a region of industrial cities . This region 's future probably will continue its present , but it is hazardous to make a prediction . Labor-saving machinery on farms i n the Agricultural Interior and elsewhere , which released so large a part of the farm population , has enabled the rural areas to serve as the population seed bags for cities of this region . In the 1920 's about 6 million persons , nearly all from farms , transferred from rural to urban areas . Further mechanization will enable still fewer people to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materials needed by the nation . Thus whereas agricultural workers in 1840 comprised 77.5 per cent of the gainfully employed , they had decreased to 21.5 per cent by 1930 and 19.9 per cent by 1940. i Tnable to remain on the farms , the rural surplus population will , as now , migrate to the cities . No one as yet knows what the future of big cities will be , though during the past few decades they have grown less rapidly than the total urban population . The National Resources Committee believes urban growth in the future will be slower and more uncertain than in the past . " The large cities ? those of more than 100,000-do not have a birth rate sufficiently great to maintain them , and without immigration from farms and small towns , they would decline to one third of that Footnote  |p476  population in 3 generations . Thus , if cities , large or small , are to grow in the future , there must be migration from other areas . Economically and socially , the small town is a better place to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living is not so high and the comforts of life are greater for the masses . Hence it would appear that people connected with manufacturing industries would do better to locate in small communities from which they could derive greater benefits in material comforts . Industries are becoming less closely tied to the regions where they began , but no one knows precisely how important rurbanism will become . There is no evidence of a marked dispersion of manufacturing establishments from city to country , but there is definitely a movement from the centers of metropolitan areas to their peripheries . Most of the farmers in the American Manufacturing Belt are not subsistence farmers ; they live on the proceeds from the sale of specialties , being " cogs in a great regional economic machine whose major function is to turn out two thirds of the nation 's manufactured goods . " s ' Though manufacturing is increasing in other parts of the continent , especially in the South and the Far West , the American Manufacturing Belt bids fair to continue as North America 's great workshop , for no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to raw materials ? the deciding factors in the location of industries ? and no other is so well served with transport facilities . Its cities should continue to supply the bulk of the fabricated products needed elsewhere throughout the continent , insofar as these are not produced locally . As Canada and the United States threw themselves into the second World War in , an all-out effort to win , strategic sites in that part of the American Manufacturing Belt lying west of the Appalachians ? the : part presumably least vulnerable to enemy bombing ? were selected by many industries for making all kinds of war materials . Footnote  |p477  Northern Continental Forest A REGION OF LOGGING , TRAPPING , MINING , AND RESORTS ANGLO-AMERICA 'S largest and least-known region ( Fig. 154 ) is largely an interminable coniferous forest , with a sprinkling of broadleaved trees , covering an area of flat to rough terrain . A map showing distribution of population superimposed on a map indicating regional boundaries will show the area 's relative emptiness . Maps of topography , soils , and climate show why there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ region consists of the Laurentian shield ( Fig. 2 ) ? a land of crystalline rock , rounded hills almost devoid of soil , fast-flowing rivers , and innumerable lakes , swamps , and muskegs . Long cold winters characterize most of the region ; its amazingly short growing season makes agriculture relatively unimportant . On the mainland proper , agricultural settlements persist only in the clay belts ( Fig. 154 ) .. From boundary to boundary , most of the inhabitants whether they be French-Canadians , nglo-Canadians , Labradorians , Newfoundlanders , Amerinds , or " Americans , " are engaged in extractive pursuits . The natural enironment discourages most other types of enterprises . A.considerable part of the population is semi-nomadic . The Laurentian Upland has experienced a certain amount of ecological succession , having passed from fur-trading to mining to logging , and in a few small areas even to farming . Fishing has been commercially important in coastal Labrador and Newfoundland . Except in the extreme southwest or east , the greater part of this region remains as it was originally ? a land of the Amerind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Amerinds . Newfoundland and Labrador This subregion occupies a strategic position across the mouth of the ( gulf of tit . Lawrence and : dung the trade route connecting  |p478  America and northwest Europe . It is advantageously situated with respect to important fishing grounds ( Fig. 41 ) . Newfouiidland , the most important part of this subregion , has long been the western terminus for trans-Atlantic cables , wireless stations , steamer lanes , and airplane crossings . More recently the island has Figure become one of the most important places for naval and air bases in eastern North America . During the second World War these new bases , along with developments in Bermuda , largely protected the industrial part of the continent . Topography Newfoundland and Labrador consist of a glaciated low-rolling rocky terrain broken here and there by mountains . Glaciation lett it studded with lakes , almost soil-bare , swampy , and with a fjor ( led shoreline . Southeast of Newfoundland , the ocean bottom consists of a submarine plateau or tableland ? one of the major fishing h : IILM of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unit Nevv'folinrll:ll ! !

As a result of the deeply serrated shoreline , no point in Newfoundland is more than 70 miles from the ocean . Altitude plays its role , as evidenced by the replacement of forest by tundra at elevations exceeding 1,000 or 1,200 feet . Because the ocean waters are above the freezing point of salt water , winter temperatures are higher than would be expected for Figure the latitude . In the Gulf ice . The bays on the Labrador coast and large areas of the adjacent sea freeze solid . Summers everywhere are cool , because the Labrador Current , laden with floe-ice and icebergs , moves southward along I he east coast . Since meteorological records have not been kept , little definite information is available on the climatic conditions of the interior . But the relative proximity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy ? St. Johns receiving 54 inches as an anmud average ( Fig. 155 ) . Considerable snow falls in the north-  |p480  western part of the subregion in winter . Ice storms , more common here than elsewhere in North America , occur when a south wind sets in . Rain freezes as it contacts the ground , which is below freezing . To aid pedestrians during such storms , St. Johns has provided some of its streets with iron railings . Fog is prevalent on the Grand Banks but not over Newfoundland , which with only 40 to 45 foggy days a year is less plagued than southeastern Nova Scotia . Winds from all points on the compass which change direction suddenly , are sometimes so strong that houses must have double walls , double doors , and double windows to keep the wind and fine snow out . ' Even trees on the shores of Labrador and Newfoundland are stunted by these winds . Natural vegetation The natural vegetation consists largely of coniferous forest though grass rather than trees characterizes the more poorly drained areas ? the muskegs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is almost completely lacking in forest , though the sheltered stream basins support some tree growth . Minerals Newfoundland contains considerable mineral wealth . At Bell Island is one of the 8 great iron-ore reserves of the world . The .. re , high-grade hematite containing 54 per cent metallic iron , extends a great distance under the sea . ' Only here in all Anglo-Anneriet-can iron ore be mined close to the ocean . Valuable lead and zine ores lie near Red Indian Lake in Newfoundland 's interior . III addition , the island has one of the world 's most extensive deposit* of fluorspar . Settlement The Newfoundland and Labrador subregion was the first par of Anglo-America to be discovered and used by white men . Tinng Newfoundland is England 's oldest colony , for many general ions + was considered unfit for human occupance . Moreover , set t It t net was discouraged because the mother country wished to use it exclU Footnote  |p481  sively for the fisheries , which in turn served as " a school of seamanship " for the British Navy . Speaking of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the summer of 1941 , Wallace Reyburn said : There could be few men better fitted to take on the duties of the Navy than these hardy Newfoundland lads . Having spent all their lives in this island colony off the east coast of Canada , they have the sea in their very bones . At an age when the average English youngster is attending preparatory school , their boys are out in their tiny fishing boats off the coasts of Newfoundland and Labrador , Figure  |p482  living up to the Newfoundlanders ' claim of being the best fishermen in the world.3 When occupance finally did get under way in the eighteenth century , practically all the population settled along the coast near the fishing grounds . Today more than 90 per cent of the inhabitants live there ( Fig. 156 ) . Contrary to much popular opinion , Newfoundland is not now and never has been a part of Canada . It is now a Crown Colony , having lost its dominion status in 1935 , a situation attributable to a desperate financial condition following loss of markets for its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Germany . Most Newfoundlanders are small in stature but wiry , of English , Scottish , and Irish extraction . Their standard of living is low ; families are large and incomes small . The interior is unsuitable for farming and is visited by myriads of mosquitoes during the two or three warm months . Among Britain 's North American possessions , Newfoundland alone failed to become primarily a colony of settlement . Economic conditions Fishing , logging , and mining are not sufficiently important to make Newfoundland and Labrador prosperous . In 1933 Newfoundland , unable to withstand the impact of the depression , had to be saved from default by Great Britain . Countries dependent upon one or two exportable raw materials have a precarious economy . Newfoundland 's dilemma was further caused by a whole series of unfortunate circumstances . She lost her foreign markets for fish ; prices dropped ; and there was a succession of bad fishing seasons . The second World War caused the loss of the German market for iron ore . Then there was the enormous expense involved in building the trans-insular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategic reasons , has little reason for existence . The large indebtedness incurred in building this road bore too heavily when other adverse factors developed . Fishing Some authorities declare that French and Portuguese fishermen came to the banks before Columbus reached the New World . ' ( ' er-Footnote  |p483  tainly commercial fishing goes back to the days when small sailing vessels carried to Europe commodities having immediate sale and bringing large returns . Codfish could be caught off the Grand Banks and at the mouth of the St. Lawrence . Fishing was solely a summer enterprise . Fishing today employs probably one quarter of the total population anti about 15,000 craft . Shore fishing , now more important than banks fishing in Newfoundland , accounts for about 75 per cent Courtesy Edwin If ' . Mills . Figure of the cod . Whereas 8,000 Newfoundlanders in 330 " bankers " fished on the banks in 1888 , only 1,000 in 40 vessels did so in a recent year . ' Fish products , until recently accounting for more than half the value of Newfoundland 's exports , are now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a demand for better-quality fish led to the catching of smaller cod and the development of " dry fishing , " the product of which was sold in the Mediterranean . ' Drying is still carried on but , compared with Iceland , Newfoundland is at a disadvantage , because it is more humid . It is the fresh-fish industry that is increasing in importance . Footnote  |p484  To hold their part of the fishing business , many vessels keep in touch by wireless with their markets . Since March 1939 , the Broadcasting Corporation of Newfoundland has provided isolated and remote settlements far up the coast with important information on fisheries ( Fig. 157 ) . Logging and lumbering Newfoundland 's best timber lands lie in the interior , extensive tracts of which have not been completely surveyed . The trees , however , are inferior to those grown along the Pacific Coast , in the Lake States , or in New England . Trees can not attain large proportions when temperatures are low and winds strong . Though some logging and lumbering are carried on , the bulk of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fortunately , title to most forested land is vested in the Crown , though licensees such as paper mills possess large holdings of good timber and the railroads have received extensive grants . At Northwest River in Labrador a large industrial sawmill has been located . ' Pulp and paper The forest , dominated by spruce and fir , supplies the raw materials for pulp and paper , the exports of which , based on value , now surpass those of fish . Laws prohibit the exportation of unmanufactured pulpwood so as to give employment to the local inhabitants . The first paper mill was built at Grand Falls in 1909 ; now there are several . One of the largest , situated at Corner Brook on Newfoundland 's west coast , has leased from the Crown 12,000 square miles or almost one third of the entire island . Newfoundland 's numerous rivers provide transportation for logs , water-power , and access to export markets . Mining The only mining of commercial significance in this subregion is carried on in Newfoundland at Bell Island in Conception lay . where iron ore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up heavy stones for ballast , left them in their dories while at anchor in St. Johns . A canny Englishman suspected these stones were iron ore , had them assayed , and found they ran about 55 per cent metallic iron . lUnfortunately , A1abaua ore is " widow Footnote  |p485  ore , " lying some distance from the nearest coking , coal in Nova Scotia . In normal times production fluctuates between 1 and 2 million tons . At the close of the first World War , Germany 's loss of Lorraine forced her to purchase large supplies of Newfoundland ore . Small amounts have been sent to Sydney , Nova Scotia , and a trickle to America 's great tidewater plant at Sparrows Point , Maryland . In the future , when Lake Superior deposits have declined , the United States will no doubt draw heavily upon this ore . ' Production of other minerals is unimpressive , though some lead and zinc are mined . Agriculture Agriculture could never be more than a small-scale enterprise in an area with so hostile a natural environment ( short growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the planting and fishing seasons conflict . Farming , largely of the subsistence type , is carried on almost exclusively by the families of fishermen and loggers . Hay and potatoes , along with hardy vegetables ( cabbages , beets , carrots , and parsnips ) , and fruits ( currants , gooseberries , raspberries , and strawberries ) , are the leading crops . In 1932 less than one half of 1 per cent of Newfoundland 's land was devoted to crops . The country will never be a great farming land , but the fishing population should give more attention to gardening . Vegetables , especially , are badly needed to combat beri-beri and other nutritional diseases . The extension of the railway has stimulated some agricultural settlement in the interior . Since the spring of 1936 , the government has encouraged the clearing of land and the planting of crops under its supervision . The large areas in bog land suitable for draining should prove valuable for pasturage and hay . Trade Newfoundland is absolutely dependent upon trade for its existence . The fish , lumber , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but unfortunately the prices of all , especially of fish , upon which the bulk of the people depend , fluctuate widely , and poor prices enforce a standard of living dangerously low . Footnote  |p486  Transportation Railways and highways have been discouraged by the rough topography , numerous streams and lakes , poorly drained uplands and abrupt cliffs , along with meager natural resources and sparse population . Not a single mile of railway exists in Labrador and southeastern Quebec , and only one line taps the interior of Newfoundland ( Fig. 156 ) . There are only 490 miles of first-class and 385 miles of second-class roads in Newfoundland . Except in Newfoundland , travel in summer is largely by canoe and in winter by dog team . Transportation by water is good except during winter . The fjorded coastline , with its numerous harbors , invites ships . During winter , however , ice completely closes the harbors of the mainland , but those on the Atlantic side of Newfoundland may remain open . Cities Cities are strikingly few . ' When colonization began , each group of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for fishing operations . The many small villages are separated by considerable distances . More than 90 per cent of the population lives along the coast , forming a " black border " ( Fig. 156 ) . St. Johns ( 39,886 ) , capital city of Newfoundland , founded ill 1580 , lies within a few miles of the most easterly point of North America . It has a pouch-shaped harbor that was used as a fishing base long before settlement . Salted cod may be seen on spruce boughs on almost any day during the fishing season . The chief port and nerve center of the island , St. Johns has the only drydock in this part of North America . The harbor is rarely frozen over in winter and has sufficient depth to accommodate vessels of 30 feet displacement . The port handles 80 per cent of the imports and . exports of the island and is the eastern terminus of the trans-insular railway . Corner Brook ( 6,374 ) , on the Humber River in the Bay of Islands , is a one-industry town with an important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mill . Because the harbor freezes over in winter , newsprint can not be exported to the United States until the ice breaks up in early summer . Corner Brook also lies on the main line of the trans-insular railway . Footnote  |p487  Botwood ( 1,090 ) , on the Bay of Exploits , formerly served only as the summer shipping port for the paper mills at Grand Falls and the mines at Buchans . It is now a large seaplane base and has taken on added significance because of the measures for warfare in the Western Hemisphere . ' " Grand Falls ( 4,244 ) , an inland paper town on the Exploits River , belongs to the Northcliffe interests . It exports pulp to Britain , where it is converted into newsprint . The company built and owns the greater part of the town ? hotels , schools , libraries , hospitals , and many of the houses . So high is the birth rate in Grand Falls that a genuine problem is being created , , since the paper mill can give only a limited amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Newfoundland and Labrador is lessened by their disagreeable climate . The coasts of Labrador and western Newfoundland are frozen solid from December till late in June , though the Atlantic coast of the island affords shelter during most of the year . The pulp and paper industry has favorable prospects but does surprisingly little for the majority of the population , whose living standards are low . Some experts believe mining has a future even in Labrador . Despite sparse population , the whole subregion , because of meager resources , seems overcrowded . Since improved conditions depend more upon fishing than upon anything else , the economic outlook appears to be unfavorable . The political outlook , too , is far from bright . It has been pointed out that Newfoundland recently relapsed from the status of a self-governing dominion to that of a Crown Colony . Self-government means self-financing  --  a difficult accomplishment in a country whose resources are meager and of the type whose prices depend upon the vagaries of international trade and hence oscillate widely on the world market . The Laurentian Shield For a long time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , except for the furs it supplied , considered to be worthless wilderness . 1 t was practically unknown except to the trappers and fur-traders , to lumbermen , prospectors , and sportsmen ? people whose numbers always are small . So inhospitable was much of the Shield that , Footnote  |p488  despite determined efforts to put roads across the rocky , shallow soil and the filigree of lakes and rivers , Canadian expansion was deflected around the southern rim . But this situation has changed in recent years with the tapping of the Shield 's wealth of forest , minerals , and water-power . Even its soils are being utilized locally , especially in the Clay Belt ( Fig. 154 ) , though for agriculture the area is precariously marginal . The Upland , though enormous in size , is isolated . Its location has been and ever will be a handicap to development . Its thin soil , poor drainage , hostile climate , and pestiferous insects add to its unattractiveness to the average immigrant . It is a magnet only to the pioneer type of human being . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an area west of the Shield but in the Northern Continental Forest .

The nearest doctor was 1,500 miles away , and it would have taken six months t o get him . . . . Contact with our neighbors and through them with the outside world was made only twice a year , once in summer when the York boat brigade came in with supplies of trading goods and provisions ; and again in winter when the mail was brought in by dog-team ' 1 Topography The Laurentian Shield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ granites , gneisses , and metamorphosed sedimentaries ) , covers two thirds of Canada , its rim towering above the St. Lawrence and Ottawa valleys and the Coast of Labrador and reaching south of Georgian Bay , Lake Huron , and Lake Superior . It was so thoroughly glaciated that its rivers were dammed , forming lakes . Drainage is poor ; swamps or muskegs are exteusiv . Lakes are so numerous that " the country might almost be deserilH as water with land between it " ( Fig. 158 ) . The rocks have . latch reduced to a peneplain of uniform height . Though there are h oat hills and valleys , there is little difference in elevation , the average being approximately 1,000 feet . The landscape should be Footnote  |p491  sidered hummocky . In addition , the ice left an irregular but thin mantle of glacial drift in some places and scraped bare extensive areas in others ( Fig. 159 ) . Climate In so enormous an area , important differences of climate from north to south or east to west might be expected , but actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? largely a result of interior location , distance from oceans , and of the barrier influence of the Rocky Mountains , which keep out the moderating effects of the Pacific Ocean . Winters are cold and long ; summers short and warm to hot ; no other part of the Dominion records such wide ranges of temperature . The total precipitation is light , and most of it falls during summer . Only in the vicinity of Hudson Bay and the Great Lakes is the influence of water felt ; here winters are less severe and summers cooler . Soils Generally speaking , the soils are sandy and poor , " second- and third-rate in quality . . . , " but over most of the area they are 3 to 4 feet deep . Contrary to popular belief , Griffith Taylor asserts that umly 5 to 10 per cent of the Shield is bare rock , the rest consisting of forests and swamps . " L The better soils lie in the Clay Belt ( Fig. 154 ) , where the clay soils are derived principally from limestone.13 Natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forest with a deciduous admixture ( Fig. 5 ) . From south to north t lie trees become smaller , those in the extreme north being " worthless little trees . " The forest has been known in detail only since the advent of aerial photography . The northern limit is determined mostly by climate and partly by drainage . The poor drainage which characterizes the flat land south of James Bay and the west coast of Hudson Bay makes this area so waterlogged that tree growth occurs only along the rivers . " Footnote  |p492  A scientific inventory of the taiga or great northern forest has been progressing since the development of aerial photography , which is making every locality accessible regardless of distance from settled areas or difficulty in land transportation . From aerial photographs , even the heights of the trees can be determined by measuring the shadows , and from the density of the forest the volume of the standing timber can be estimated . Not only is this method faster but it is more economical , the cost being about $7.75 per square mile as against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by relatively few species , those of greatest commercial value being pine and spruce ? pines in a broad belt north of the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River ; spruce north of it , and scattered and slow-growing spruce of little commercial value in the sub-Arctic belt before it merges with the tundra ( Fig. 160 ) . There is a stand of hardwoods in the southeastern part of the Shield , but , since hardwood logs can not be river-driven , this forest until recently was little utilized . The increased demand for hardwood lumber and mechanical improvements in logging equipment are , however , enabling these forests to be tapped . The leading hardwood tree is yellow birch . Native animal life Native animal life was originally abundant . This meant a relatively scant human population which could not be increased mat erially by resort to agriculture . Among the numerically more haportant animals are the beaver , martin , mink , muskrat , otter , caribou , moose , deer , wolf , fox , bear , and rabbit . Fish , too , are abundant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so n 11-merous as to make life almost unbearable . Insects constitute the outstanding handicap to settlement and exploitation . Water-power Few areas in the world have better water-power sites than the Canadian Shield . Large rivers and small rivers seldom run morn than a few miles without tumbling over a fall or rapid . Moreover , they have their sources in lakes which serve as excellent st.orage reservoirs . Eighty-two per cent of the developed and roughly ( 10 per cent of the Dominion 's potential water-power are in the coal-1e provinces of Ontario and Quebec . " Much of this water-power lies Footnote  |p495  far from centers of population ( Figs. 161 and 13 ) , but much of it is connected by transmission lines with the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence areas . A great disadvantage is the cold winters , during which the streams freeze over and power is not available . Ontario reserves its water-power as a public property , while Quebec does the opposite . Therefore , competition is keen and agreements on conservation practices are difficult to obtain . The abundance of this power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mining in the Laurentian Shield . The occupance The Amerind . Before white men came , the Shield was occupied by nomadic Amerinds who subsisted by hunting and fishing . It is not known whether they ever tried agriculture , but if they did it was unsuccessful , since the climate is too severe for maize . Their numbers were small ? possibly 500,000 for all North America north of the Great Lakes . ' The density of population has been estimated for that time at approximately 2 to 5 people per 100 square miles . It is significant that these inland Amerinds were by area even less numerous than the Eskimos along the shore of the Arctic . ' $ This relative emptiness of inhabitants was due to a " warlike social tradition " ' s and to the fact that hunting and trapping always preclude a dense population , since they entail the great disadvantage of uncertainty : today game may be plentiful , tomorrow it may be lacking . Hence life was precarious , poverty extreme , and starvation not uncommon . These Amerinds , backward Algonkins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Crees in the Clay Belt J0 ( Fig. 8 ) , were highly mobile both within and between their tribal areas . Marking off their hunting grounds by blazing trees , they never encroached on one another 's territory until after the arrival of white men . Culture here was lower than in the Southwest . The paucity of formidable barriers east of the Rockies meant in general terms a similarity of environment and culture . With the coining of white men , trapping for furs became important . So keen was the competition between the French and Hnglish traders that Tndian tribes warred upon one another . Footnote  |p496  The submarginal portions of the Laurentian Shield remain the land of the Amerind , whose culture demands a thorough knowledge of the habits of wild animals and ability to move over wide areas in pursuit of food and peltries . Large tracts are now specifically reserved where only Amerinds may hunt and trap.21 In certain areas where airplanes might be used to transport furs , they have not been encouraged , because they would cost the Amerind his " spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bringing in supplies . Steady employment of the native is the crux of the matter . " 22 White settlement . The wide scope of this book does not permit . a detailed treatment of white settlement on the Laurentian Shield . Two motives actuated those who dared enter the wilderness : ( 1 ) to gain and plunder the natural resources , and ( 2 ) to make homes there and build new societies.23 The fur-trader exemplified the first , the farmer the second . Though the land never can accommodate many settlers , nevertheless , much money and time have been spent in a fruitless effort to push the frontier beyond its natural limits . By 1855 the better lands of eastern Canada had been acquired and settlement was " washing the shores " of the Shield . At this time and for decades afterwards the Shield was known only superficially . As in the Intermontane Basins and Plateaus ( Chapter XVIII ) two interests were working against each other : one , trying to administer the natural resources in the-wisest way , was desperately attempting to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than good , whereas the other used all its power to encourage settlement . That the Shield is a restrictive environment , seems proved by the fact that after almost a century following pioneer penetration , the Crown still has title to all but a miniscule percentage of the land.74 Many who did settle have moved away from the pines and rocks . It is now generally believed that pioneers . should be discouraged from engaging in " hot-house colonizing . " Public acceptance of such an idea is difficult to obtain , for one of the deepest-seated human instincts is that " the land is for the people . " Footnote  |p497  The impact of the white man ' upon the Amerind . The history of the fur trade is the history of the contact of two civilizations ? the European and the Amerindian . The limited cultural background of the latter provided a considerable demand for products from Europe . With guns , iron axes , and iron needles , the Amerind could gain a livelihood more easily . With European weapons more animals fell before him , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ammunition manufacturing were beyond his knowledge. = ' Thus the old cultural traits began to disappear , the old ways of getting a livelihood were forgotten , and the delicate balance which had existed so long between the Amerind and nature was destroyed . Have the natives benefited or lost ? Authorities overwhelmingly agree they have lost and that they are now actually threatened by their imported civilization . Both their racial character and health have suffered . Present population . The first whites were French explorers and fur-trappers who did not settle on the land . Later French immigrants whose descendents comprise the present French-Canadians occupied the St. Lawrence Valley between Montreal and Quebec as well as several tributary valleys . As a result of the limited arable land and the high birth rate , some of these spilled over into adjacent areas and now comprise a considerable part of the Shield 's population . Later came English fur-trappers and traders ? rivals of the French . The transfer of Canada by France to England increased the number of Anglo-Saxons in Canada , though most of these went into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , were drawn onto the Shield by its timber , minerals , and , to a lesser degree , its agriculture . More recent immigrants are the Germans , Finns , Hungarians , Italians , Russians , Poles , Slovaks , and Swedes . On the Shield these nationalities tend to segregate into blocks , as they do in the large metropolitan centers of eastern United States . The introduction of mining started an influx of peoples from all types of climates , some well fitted and some poorly fitted to cope with the harsh environment . Those who remained had to develop initiative and resourcefulness . The Shield , which is largely marginal and submarginal , is supporting a mere fraction of the total population of Canada ( Fig. 13 ) . This will change little in the future . Footnote  |p498  Economic development Regardless of whether man has engaged in fur-trading , lumbering , mining , or farming , his activities have been dominated by the forest . The explorer and fur-trader , unable to go cross-country on - foot or horseback as did their American contemporaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the forest . To lumbermen the forest was a great natural resource from which they desired to keep out all but themselves . The prospector and the farmer , on the other hand , did not look kindly upon the forest ; to them it was an enemy that had to be destroyed . It is no coincidence that the " Ontario farmer cordially hates a tree . " The prospector sees in the forest simply a covering that prevents his knowing what kind of rock underlies his feet . Extractive industries then have and probably always will hold sway on the Shield . Agriculture will expand briefly but will be relegated to a secondary place unless science makes contributions now unknown . Trapping Fur-trading began along the coast , but it never attained great proportions there because the short rivers were poorly suited to transportation and because the population was concentrated along the coast . The enterprise really became important and migrated onto the Shield in the latter part of the sixteenth century when beaver hats became fashionable in Europe . Beavers were most numerous in the more northerly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had little chance of success and where the environment provided a favorable habitat for fur-bearing animals . The beaver was not a migrant , and its destruction in any locality forced the hunters to enter new areas . Prime furs were taken only in winter and in the more northerly parts of the forest . Fur-hunting still is important here ; about two thirds of Canada 's peltries based on value are from animals trapped in this area and one third from those raised on farms throughout the Dominion . When possible the animals are caught in snares or traps to avoid damaging the pelts ( Fig. 162 ) . Because fur is longer and thicker in winter , Amerinds and half-breeds at that time scatter out ? along the streams , sometimes going hundreds of miles to get their pelt riesr , The more desirable animals ? the beaver , otter , and muskrat livo along the streams . Moreover , waterways are highways ( Fig. 1(u) , even in winter , when they form ready-made hand roads . When ice melts in the airing , hunters take their catch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and larger boats are used . Many of the fur-trading posts belong to the historic Hudson 's Bay Company ( established in 1670 ) , which accounts for nearly half of Canada 's furs . It has 221 trading posts strategically located with respect to navigable water . Most of the raw furs Courtesy tiuJlson 's Bay Co . Figure move to St. Louis and Montreal , the continent 's leading markets , i hough the Hudson 's Bay Company crop is sold at special auction London . The railway , motorcar , boat , and airplane have made some changes in the fur business during recent years . The advance of Iumbering , mining , and agricultural settlement , along with more efficient methods of trapping , has driven the frontier of fur-bearing animals farther afield and has greatly reduced their numbers . Footnote  |p501  Wild life destruction and conservation . The Canadian government has set aside national parks , game sanctuaries , beaver and mink farms , and has put into effect closed seasons where natural conditions provide suitable habitats . It has organized preventive patrols and is issuing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retard excessive exploitation . This conservation is intermeshed with the safeguarding of the future of the Indian population . Fur resources must remain adequate for the thousands of Amerinds whose livelihood is almost entirely dependent on trapping . Logging and lumbering Logging and lumbering superseded trapping in the more accessible territory when the beaver was destroyed . The industry has been based largely upon the pines which grow as far north as the Hudson Bay drainage . Trees grow slowly in cold , windy climates and on thin , rocky soils and poorly drained land . Thus about 100 years are required for a tree in such a habitat to reach sufficient size to be used for saw timber . Lumbering on the Shield has declined in importance in recent years because of ( 1 ) the competition of British Columbia and of northern Europe , whose forests are more accessible , ( 2 ) the exhaustion of the best pine near the St. Lawrence , and ( 3 ) the high tariffs in the United States . When the forests of British Columbia have been removed as have those of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more important source of lumber , though in the northern part species dwindle in number and size . Logging and lumbering depend upon snow in this region of long cold winters . Tractors and horses pull sleds laden with logs that were cut in early autumn . The logs , upon being delivered at a ' stream , are dumped on the ice to await the spring thaws and the freshets , which transport them by the hundreds of thousands to strategically located sawmills ( Fig. 164 ) . River-driving is an economical method of transporting logs , though this applies almost entirely to softwoods . Logging employs the workers ( Slays , Swedes , Finns , and French-Canadians ) only about 100 days per year . Some of the lumberjacks are farmers who must supplement the living they eke from the land by other means . At present the lumber industry of the Shield is relatively unimportant . Many abandoned mills are moldering , numerous villages have been deserted . nod " a derelict and hopeless population is  |p503  marooned in the backwoods . " With the exhaustion of much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as jack pine and hemlock are being used more and more for lumber . Pulp and paper is eastern Canada 's leading industry and Canada is now the world 's largest manufacturer of newsprint ( Figs. 22 and 165 ) . Beginning in 1866 , the industry grew steadily until the termination of the first World War , then boomed between 1920 and 1930 , when new towns sprang up over night , huge hydro projects were installed , and thousands of persons were employed . Much of the industry is controlled by American capital . The United States , the world 's largest consumer of newsprint , is interested in Canada and the Shield in particular because it is near by and because newsprint since 1911 has been admitted free of duty . Some pulpwood also is exported ( see p. 76 ) . At first the paper companies , which engaged only in manufacturing , purchased their pulpwood . So great , however , became the demands that they were unable to meet the requirements by purchase and hence were obliged to get either freehold or Crown grants . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area is retained by the Crown , whereas in the United States 80 per cent is in private ownership . Canadian pulp and paper manufacturing , however , is not restricted to the Shield ( Fig. 22 ) . A close correlation exists between the location of the pulp and paper industry , the spruce-balsam forests , and the distribution of water-power . Spruce , though growing as far north as trees can , really reaches its optimum along the Hudson Bay Divide . So extensive is this forest that it would appear to be able to supply present needs in perpetuity , provided reasonable conservation is carried on . The method of transporting pulp logs is similar to that used by the lumber industry ( Fig. 166 ) . Relation between water-power and pulp and paper mills . Cheap power is an important factor in the location of newsprint plants , as is shown by their distribution . A string of mills ( all water-driven ) lines the southern edge of the forest from the mouth of the St. Lawrence to Lake Winnipeg ( Fig. 22 ) . If , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mill lies on navigable water so that of her raw materials can be secured cheaply and finished products be shipped economically , its location is strategic . A paper mill is a Footnote  |p506  huge and costly plant which can not afford to migrate even if its tributary area is denuded of forest cover ( Fig. 165 ) . The practice now is to follow reforestation as a means of insuring a continuous and permanent supply . A company having a large area with trees at all stages of growth has little to worry about if fires can be avoided . Moreover , the large-scale processes and the enormous cost of the plants have a good psychological effect upon the people who live in the region , for they look upon this industry as a permanent one one not out to exploit or mine the forest , as has been the case with too many sawmills . Mining The Laurentian Shield is world famous for its mineral wealth . Prospecting over much of the area is facilitated by ( 1 ) bareness of the rock , ( 2 ) accessibility by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an accurate geological map for areas along stream courses . Had the region not been glaciated , prospecting would have been far more difficult . Many of the outstanding mineral deposits were discovered by chance ? mining beginning as a by-product of railroadbuilding , the fundamental purpose of which was the development of agriculture in the Clay Belt of northern Ontario . " Much prospecting today is done by airplane , the greatest single aid to the extension of mining . Power , essential for operating the mines and mills , was at first supplied by wood , but as near-by areas were cut off , the cost because greater . Water-power replaced it , being first used by the mines in Ontario in 1906 . Among the Shield 's more important minerals are nickel , copper , platinum , gold , silver , and iron . Mickel , one of the more important ferro-alloys , gives steel certain physical properties such as hardness , toughness , and strength . Certain combinations of nickel and copper are exceedingly resistant to corrosion . ' Canada , whose ores were discovered about 50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , accounting for about seven eighths of the world 's supply . The entire output comes from the Sudbury district in Ontario ( Fig. 167 ) , an area about 550 square miles in extent lying some 35 miles north of Lake Huron . The area is well located with respect to the United States market . The delrusilM Footnote  |p508  are sufficiently extensive to meet world requirements for at least a century at the normal rate of consumption . Copper of high grade occurs with nickel in the Sudbury district ; for every pound of nickel procured , there is a simultaneous yield of about two pounds of copper . Today Canada is an important copper producer , but most of the output has to be sold overseas , since the United States , the world 's largest producer , imposes an import duty of 4 cents a pound . Platinum is procured as a by-product of nickel , and today Sudbury accounts for about one half of the world 's output . Russia , South Africa , the United States , and Colombia are the other plantinumproducing countries . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ /old . Most of the goldworkings are being developed in the Shield , and the area between the Great Lakes and Hudson Bay is peppered with mines . Gold-mining has been so successful as to have stimulated prospecting from the eastern to the western ends of Ontario and Quebec , and important discoveries have been made some hundreds of miles from railways . Many authorities believe that prospectors have , barely scratched the surface . The two most famous districts are the Porcupine and the Kirkland Lake ( Fig. 167 ) , whose 20 mines contribute 58 per cent of Canada 's gold . Silver . Cobalt ( Fig. 167 ) is the great silver center of the Shield . High-grade ore ( some of it native silver ) is found close to the surface in small exposed veins ranging in width from 1 to 20 inches . In the early stages of development this could be picked out anal shipped to smelters , little capital being required . Later on substantial returns received from working high-grade ores were reinvested to furnish capital for more expensive undertakings . Much silver is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold . In fact , the total amount from this source exceeds that from socalled silver mines . Agriculture It has been reliably estimated that 85 per cent of Canada is unsuited to farming . Nevertheless , following the common belief that all forest lands could be used for farming , Canadians during the nineteenth century pushed into the northern wilderness=the Laurentian Shield ? which someone has called " an agricultural noman 's land . " Most settlers believed that the plow would immediately follow the woodsman 's axe . Accordingly , enormous 1ractm of forest were cleared that have since proved to he ill-suited even for subsistence farnling.  |p509  The agricultural pioneer has actually penetrated the Shield in only a few favored places , such as the Clay Belt ( Fig. 154 ) . In the future , farming must be subordinated to trapping , mining , lumbering , and pulp- and paper-making , because of poor soils and severe climate . Only the French-Canadians are willing to fight nature on her terms , to clear the forest , and to withstand the possibilities of repeated crop failures . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their native parishes . With a low standard of living , they till precariously marginal land that most other nationalities would avoid . Farming is the preferred way of life and the safest from the Anglo-Saxon influences that go with industrial life . There is , of course , an ulterior motive for settlement in Quebec ? the authoritarian basis for extension on behalf of a creed . The Quebec government , noting the heavy emigration of FrenchCanadian farmers to the urban centers of northern United States , urged active colonization as a means of keeping them in Canada . These farmers grow " a few ' simple necessaries , live in a rude log shack without any pretensions to comfort , bring up their families of ten or even twenty children and send them off to work in the camps ' as soon as they grow old enough . " 33 The climate is not conducive to farming . Winters are long and extremely severe , and the growing season , always short , varies in length from year to year . The rainfall , though ample in amount ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falling largely during the harvest period . Accordingly , many crops are ruined as they stand in the field . There are cases , though they are extreme ones , of farmers who have harvested only four crops out of nineteen.33 If livestock are kept , the long , cold winters necessitate costly feeding . Most of the farming ( except where local markets exist ) is of the subsistence type . Fifteen to twenty acres are broken and comprise the average farm . The mining and the pulp and paper industries have brought in their wake an increased population which has stimulated agricultural development in near-by areas . The principal crops , hay , barley , oats , potatoes , and vegetables , are of the hardy type . Since it is extremely difficult to live solely from the land , nearly every farmer works during the winter ( his off-season ) in a lumber camp , in a mine , or in a pulp mill . Footnote  |p510  Agriculture in the Clay Belt . The Clay Belt ( Fig. 154 ) remained almost empty for 2 centuries following discovery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is separated by the wedge of the Shield from Toronto ( 450 miles ) , Montreal ( 600 miles ) , and Winnipeg ( 1,000 miles ) ; without the railway and airplane it could not possibly be reached . Its isolation may always be a distinct handicap . Unfortunately , the Clay Belt produces crops precisely like those grown iu the older parts of Quebec and Ontario , areas which are much closer to markets . The mining districts , located near the margins of the Clay Belt , have a population of only about 60,000 . The Clay Belt is more than a pocket . It is estimated that some day 29,000,000 acres may be available for agriculture ? 16,000,000 in Ontario and 18,000,000 in Quebec . This is probably too large a figure , for much of the land is no doubt marginal . Today not more than 5 per cent of the Clay Belt is occupied . Many middle-latitude crops can not be produced because of the short growing season . John Randall , commenting on the future of the Clay Belt , says : It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some other sections of the Shield . Likewise it is as certain that the region will not become an agricultural area of primary importance to the Dominion . . . . ' Manufacturing The aluminum industry , like that of pulp and paper , is dependent upon an abundance of cheap power . No other electro-metallurgical operation consumes so much electricity . To make one ton of aluminum requires electrical energy equivalent to that of 16 tons of coal ; this amount would produce 18 tons of newsprint . The aluminum industry then , " a hog for power , " of necessity seeks out cheap electricity . The Shield , with its riches of water-power , has enabled Canada to rank third among all the countries in the world in the manufacture of aluminum . The importance of power can best be appreciated by the fact that all the raw materials must be imported ( Fig. 168 ) . Canada 's industry is located at Shawinigan Falls and Arvidu , Quebec ( Fig. 168 ) . The plant at Arvida is reputed to be the largest , in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as does all of greater Montreal . Since it is not on navigable water , terminal facilities are at Port Alfred , 20 miles from the head of Footnote  |p512  ocean navigation on the Saguenay River , with which it is connected by railway . The smelting and refining of copper and nickel constitute a major enterprise on the Shield , employing labor and capital on so large a scale as to give them rank among the Dominion 's leading industries . Noranda , 350 miles northwest of Montreal , ig Quebec 's leading base-metal producer . Its products include copper , gold , silver , silenium , and tellurium . The Sudbury area 's smelters and refinery handle most of Ontario 's base metals . Here the International Nickel Company operates a smelter at Coniston and a smelter and refinery at Copper Cliffs . The copper electrolytic refinery at the latter place is the greatest in the British Empire . Formerly nickel was refined in the United States ; but , because of a strong feeling that it should be done within the Dominion to enable Canadians to share in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colborne . Flin Flon , 400 miles northwest of Winnipeg on the boundary between Manitoba and Saskatchewan , has both a smelter and a refinery . Its products are copper , zinc , gold , silver , and silenium . Transportation The first transportation in this area was by canoe in summer and by dog team and sledge in winter . The maze of waterways with only short portages enabled the canoe to go unbelievable distances , and the accumulation of snow due to the absence of thaws in winter made sledging easy . The Hudson 's Bay Company , because of its policy of relying largely on Amerinds , has been little interested in the transport business . Railway construction was begun as a means of encouraging agricultural settlement and , in the case of the Hudson Bay Railway , to enable the wheat growers of the Prairie Provinces to compete more favorably with Argentina and Australia . Where construction has penetrated mining districts , the government has had to assist  - -  the Crowsnest Pass Railway , the Temiskaming &; Northern Ontario Railway , and the more recent lines to Flin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 169A ) . Yet the mining industry creates a demand for high-grade produce , supports an important traffic , and tends to encourage mixed farming in its tributary area insofar as nature permits . Though the Hudson Bay Railway did not have as its primary purpose the opening up of mineral lands , the line serves as the key to the saxicultnra possibilities of a vast stretch of the Shield .  |p514  For a long tithe after mining was developed in the Upland , the traffic was heavy only one way ? inbound , and it was not until 1918 , with the boom of the pulp and paper industry , that outbound or southbound traffic became more important than inbound or northbound traffic.3 ' The airplane is revolutionizing transportation on the Shield ( Fig. 169B ) . A plane can cover more distance in one hour than a canoe in 5 days . In winter , by using skis and " nose warmers , " airplanes can penetrate the most remote parts of the Shield , placing prospectors on the ground before the spring breakup . In summer , pontoons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because the lack of overburden on the Shield permits the geologist to detect rock structures . Tractors are being used more and more , summer and winter ( Fig. 166 ) , in both the mining and the forest industries . Trade The products of the Shield are those badly needed by great industrial nations . Either they are necessities , such as minerals , lumber , pulp , and paper , or luxuries such as furs . Recreation The Laurentian Shield is excellently adapted to recreation . Because of its relative nearness to population centers of southern Canada and northeastern United States , this subregion is building each year an increasing number of summer hotels and cottages h ) accommodate tourists who want the solitude of the great " Nora h Wood . " As motor roads are built , the summer population of the Shield should increase . Fishing , hunting , and canoeing all ; n e excellent . This subregion also is world-famous for its winter sport Near Montreal are numerous centers catering to skiers ( Fig. 17111 . Cities and towns Nowhere in the Laurentian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have about a dozen cities of more Ham 10,000 inhabitants , and a number of towns with 1,000 to 4,011o . Footnote  |p516  With the exception of The Pas ( 3,153 ) , a thriving commercial center in west-central Manitoba on the Hudson Bay Railway , nearly all towns and cities are inseparably linked to the mining industry . Flin Flan ( 6,821 ) , on the raw edge of the frontier in Manitoba , is a one-industry town , its importance being due more to the quantity than to the quality of its copper and zinc ores . Sudbury ( 31,888 ) , located north of Lake Huron and on important rail routes , exists only because of the nickel-copper ores . Sudbury attained the rank of a city in 1930 . Shawinigan Falls ( 20,237 ) is situated on the St. Maurice River 21 miles north of Three Rivers . ? It is on both the Canadian Pacific and the Canadian National railways . Its strategic location on the St. Maurice gives it an abundance of cheap water-power , which operates great electro-metallurgical and chemical industries . Shawinigan Falls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Among the other important towns are Timmins ( 28,544 ) , Cobalt ( 2,332 ) , Kirkland Lake ( 17,340 ) , Noranda ( 4,538 ) , Amos ( 2,835 ) , Copper Cliff ( 3,695 ) , and Arvida ( 4,564 ) . The outlook The railway , highway , and airplane have made the Shield accessible . In only a very few places can settlements be anything more than small isolated pockets of varying size . It is not known what science may permit in the way of agriculture in the future . There have been many failures to date , but the pioneer stock attempts to hold on . Undoubtedly new mineral discoveries will be male , and these will tend to boom local areas . They will , however , in crease the population of the Shield only in a small way and for ; c relatively short time . The real future of this area depends upon the forest because it provides water storage , a permanent refuge for fur-bearing aniiu ; t Is and the Amerindian population , and a primeval wilderness for 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locked within he fastnesses of the Canadian Shield . The Upper Lakes Subregion The Upper Lakes subregion , often called the " cut-over area , " includes ' northeastern Minnesota , northern Wisconsin anal . Al iel - igan , and the part of Ontario that lies north of lakes 1linn and Superior ( Fig. 1511.  |p517  Like the major region , the Upper Lakes subregion is a land of extractive industries ? fishing , trapping , logging , and mining . Topography The " cut-over area " was largely scraped bare by the continental glaciers . The ice gouged out the softer rocks , the depressions later forming thousands of small lakes ; it also deranged the drainage and threaded the area with a filigree of rivers . It mellowed the terrain over which it moved . Thus low hills characterize much of the land , though high steep hills locally called " mountains " lie along the western and southern shores of Lake Superior . The rocks are much like those noted in the Laurentian Upland of which this area is a part ; they are ancient , tightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being Continental , is subject to the severe variations that characterize the interiors of large land areas in middle latitudes ( Fig. 155B ) . Winters are long and cold , summers short and cool . h:xtreme temperatures may range from - 50 ? to 105 ? F. The growing season varies from 90 to 100 days , though at Marquette and other places on the south shore of Lake Superior it is 158 days long . There are large sections where the first autumn frost arrives early in September . Precipitation varies from 25 to 35 inches , falling mostly as rain . Though only 10 to 20 per cent is snow , the whole area is snow-covered for 90 to 120 days ? a longer period than in any other area of comparable size in the United States.36 Soils The soils , like those elsewhere in the region , are poorly ? suited for growing standard crops . They are also distributed in intricate patterns with pockets of fertility scattered here and there in the huge wilderness of non-productive land . All soils , gray podzols , are light in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from crystalline rocks and lie in a humid climate . Some areas are strewn with glacial granitic boulders , while others are characterized by deep , sterile sand or peat and muck . ' When the frontier was moving over the Upper Lakes subregion , Footnote  |p518  no soil surveys had been made and nothing was known regarding its suitability for crops . Accordingly , settlers took anything that was cheap , believing that crops would grow wherever trees did . The result was an irregular , inefficient , and illogical pattern of land use . Public agencies are now trying to do the best they can for the people who settled in this area of meager resources . Natural vegetation When the explorers and fur traders broke into this subregion , they found a virgin forest consisting of conifers in the northern and northwestern part and mixed forest in the southern part ( Fig. 5 ) . White pine was the principal commercial tree . but jack and Norway pine and even spruce and fir were associated with it . I n the southern portion were beech , birch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew on the better soils ; the conifers , in the more sandy sections.3r The best of the forests was in northern Michigan , northeastern Wisconsin , and central and northern Minnesota . Native animal life The forests and streams abounded with wild life . Such furbearers as the beaver , marten , fisher , and otter throve . Deer , moose , and bear were numerous , as were the ubiquitous wolf and fox . Migratory waterfowl and fresh-water fish were abundant . The occupance During the first half of the nineteenth century , settlement spread rapidly over the trans-Appalachian region so far as rainfall would permit crop production . The Upper Lakes area was less fortunate , remaining an unbroken forest for 2 centuries after its discovery the only development of any sort being the trapping and trading of furs . Lumbermen rather than farmers finally opened it . They bought the land , built transport facilities , cut off the timber , and got out . Their business was timber , not land.ss Footnote  |p519  Ecological succession Few areas in Anglo-America better exemplify ecological succession than this one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fishing , lumbering , mining , and farming . Trapping The virgin wilderness abounded in wild life , with winters long and cold enough to put the furs in prime condition . The early voyageurs who came by way of the Great Lakes found ideal conditions for their vocation . ' " The interior location and the great distance from Europe meant that only products that were valuable , easily conveyed , and in great demand could bear the costly transportation . This enterprise was the principal business for 2 centuries after the discovery of the subregion . Fishing Fishing was a flourishing industry in lakes Huron , Michigan , and Superior , antedating lumbering and mining . White fish and lake trout in 1880 made up 70 per cent of the catch . During the past 50 years , however , they have declined steadily as a result of overfishing , destruction of immature fish , and the fouling of waters by city .. sewage and industrial waste . Even so , these three lakes still account for 60 per cent of the fresh-water fish caught commercially in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the catch was valued at $3,500,000 . Nearly all of the fish are caught luring the summer months . Logging and lumbering This subregion had North America 's largest and densest stand of white pine . When forests of this highly prized tree had been mined out " of New England and the Middle Atlantic States , lumbermen led the onslaught into the northern Lakes area . Contributing factors were the rapid urbanization of the Middle West and Improvements in transportation ? the Erie Canal and the building of railroads . Yet the real mass attack on the forest did not begin until the termination of the War Between the States . By 1870 , Wichigaft ranked fiat itt the production of lumber and reached its Footnote  |p520  peak in the decade 1880-1890 . In 1896 a traveler covering 40 counties and going 2,000 miles wrote that : The heart of the white pine country , from Manistee on the west to Saginaw on the east is an almost continuous succession of abandoned lumber fields , miles upon miles of stumps as far as the eye can see .. . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minnesota , which took leadership , attaining its peak in 1900.4 ' This army of lumbermen had one-track minds : theysought but one resource ? pine . They cut any tree so long as it was big and they were not concerned when young growths were ruined by the fall of the tree they were cutting . Stripping the forest , leaving only slashings and stumps in their wake , they moved on . Whereas in 1890 these three Lake states produced 35 per cent of the nation 's total , by 1910 they could not supply their own needs , and today they produce only 4 per cent , the bulk consisting of hardwoods . By 1920 even the best hardwoods had been cut off . Reforestation was hardly considered . Everyone thought that with so vast an area of dense growing timber and with much yet tai be cut , the forest was inexhaustible . Accordingly the land was repeatedly burned over ( Fig. 171 ) . These fires destroyed the seedlings and the forest litter and so ruined the topsoil that in many localities white pine can no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in land-utilization surveying in Michigan , estimates that these sand-pine lands will require 500 years undisturbed by man to produce a pine forest like the original one.42 The mining industry The Upper Lakes subregion is one of North America 's richest in minerals ? not in variety , but in quantity , and of the type most in demand by industry . South and west of Lake Superior lie the continent 's best , largest , and most favorably located iron ores . o n the Keweenaw Peninsula are the richest and oldest , though not t Itamost profitable , copper accumulations . On the west shore of Lake Huron are most valuable deposits of metallurgical limestone . Mining ' is the outstanding economic enterprise inthis area . today . Footnote  |p522  The removal of copper , but more particularly of iron ore , caused the redrawing of much of the industrial map of the United States , for the center of the iron and steel industry migrated from the Ohio River to the shores of the lower Great Lakes . Billions of tons of red hematite ore have been found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie in mountains , as the word " ranges " suggests , but in elongated east-west extending beds ( Fig. 172 ) . They were formed during an ancient mountain-building period , but erosion has long since worn down the mountains and the terrain is now almost flat . In the Mesabi Range ; the ore deposits , shallow and extensive , are covered by glacial till to a depth of 10 to 150 feet . Mesabi ore is an example of deposition and concentration of ores in small valleys between hills ( Fig. 172 ) . On the Gogebic Range , the iron deposits lie hundreds of feet below the surface . Its ores exemplify the deposition and concentration of ore by circulating waters in underground channels ( Fig. 172 ) . Eleven counties ( 3 in Minnesota , 5 in Michigan , and 3 in Wisconsin ) comprise the famous " Lake Superior iron ore region , " which accounts for 85 per cent of American production . Minnesota alone contributes 61 per cent of the total . Without Lake Superior iron ore , the American industry would possibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Upon the Mesabi Range ( the greatest body of iron ore in the world ) has been built the extensive iron-ore and lake-shipping business , and indirectly most of the steel manufacturing of the Lower Great Lakes area . Billions of tons already have been removed , but at the present rate of mining ? about 60 million tons per year ( 79,827,335 gross tons in 1941 ? an all-time high ) , the ore should last at least 25 years . Data on reserves are not dependable , for the steel companies give out no more information than necessary , since they report no more taxable property than the public authorities choose to recognize.43 Production on a large scale began about the time the lumber industry was declining . Shipments from the Marquette Range ( the only producer until 1877 ) started in 1854 , and those from the Mesabi in 1892 , when the first railroad reached it . At first , mining in the Lake Superior area was done undergroulitl . In time large deposits of high-grade Mesabi ore i1I loose forte were discovered near the surface . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Footnote  |p524  shovels after the glacial overburden had been removed . Thus open-pit mining , the fastest and most economical method known , came into use ( Fig. 173 ) . This mode of mining can be followed only in summer . Underground mining is carried on the year round , the ore being stock-piled during winter . As mining went forward , the richer and better ore was removed . Today , in order to send high-grade hematite down the lakes , it must first be beneficiated ? much earthy material being removed prior to shipment . The Mesabi Range contributes about three fifths of the total production of the Lake Superior area . Since 1892 , it has sent down the lakes approximately a billion tons of ore . The greatness of the Mesabi Range is due to ( 1 ) large size , ( 2 ) nearness of ore to the surface , ( 3 ) quality of the ore , ( 4 ) proximity to Lake Superior , and ( 5 ) ease of mining . The ore was first recovered with hand shovels ; later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tons at a single bite . Railway tracks are built into the pits . More recently , crawler trucks on giant rubber tires have been used . The world 's greatest single mine , the Hull Rust at Hibbing , Minnesota , is 350 feet deep , from 1/2 to 1 mile across , and 2 ? miles long , with an area of 1,100 acres . Taxation of iron ore . Most of the inhabitants live in mining communities , and the mines are largely owned by steel interests in the East . Minnesota counties , especially , have been taxing these absentee owners heavily . As a result , tourists are amazed at the fine roads and well-equipped schools in an otherwise exceedingly poor region . The state of Minnesota has a commission of experts in mining accounting , mineralogy , geology , and mining engineering who permit no discovered ores to escape assessment . The iron and steel manufacturers complain bitterly , pointing out that Minnesota 's mining tax is 10 times as great proportionately as that for the nation as a whole . On the other hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent of the ore , is averse to sending millions of tons of tin ' red metal down the lakes each year , leaving in place of the rich heritage vast holes in the ground . Ore shipped down the lake means only a dollar or so to the state but is worth $8.00 to $200.00 and more when converted into iron and steel at Gary , Cleveland , or Pittsburgh . Minnesota used this as a major argument in get 1 ing the United States Steel Corporation to construct the plant at Duluth . " It seems certain that the iron and steel indnsiry will Footnote  |p526  remain largely where it is so long as the chief source of ore is the Lake Superior district . The influence of the ore-producing area never will be strong enough to draw the iron and steel industry to it . Moreover , the large steel markets lie hundreds of miles to the southeast , and the restraining influence of freight rates from the coal fields of Pennsylvania , West Virginia , and eastern Kentucky will keep most of the steel plants where , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ores , Michigan levies only against the exploited ones , those adjacent to them , and those most evident . It would , appear that the different mode of taxing in the two states is ( 1 ) a political expression of Minnesota 's predominant agrarianism ? indicated by the fact that the taxation of a dollar invested in a mine is twice the rate on a dollar invested in a farm , and ( 2 ) a desire on the part of Michigan ore owners to compete with Minnesota ore , which has certain natural advantages . Copper , mined by the Arnerinds long before white men reached the New World , was even then an important article of trade . Commercial exploitation did not begin with the Amerind but with the white man . Michigan was the leading copper state from 1847 to 1887 ? until the great porphyry deposits in the West were developed . Native copper in a chemically pure state is found in the Keweenaw Peninsula . Reserves are not well known , since the mineralized zone  --  a narrow belt 2 to 4 miles wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prospected . For a long time practically the entire supply of the United States came from here ? 96 per cent in 1849 . After years of continued output , however , the mines have had to go deeper and higher production costs have resulted . In addition , lower prices and new techniques for handling the low-grade surface ores in the West so adversely affected the Michigan industry that by 1930 it accounted for only 9 per cent of America 's output . Some mines are now nearly a mile below the surface . Limestone . In Alpena County , Michigan , lies North America 's leading source of metallurgical limestone . The quarries lie so close to the lake shore that , despite the fact that they are geographically ? 300 miles from the blast furnaces , they are economically only : 1 ( 1 miles away , since water rates are only one tenth as much as ra i I rates . Accordingly , this area has become the largest and the cheapest source of stone for the great iron and steel plants of tin Great Lakes area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p527  each year . Limestone is used in blast furnaces to remove from the ore such impurities as silica and alumina , which have a stronger affinity for lime than for iron.46 The quarry of the Michigan Limestone &; Chemical Company at Calcite has 9 ? miles of vertical quarry side from which electric power shovels of 23 tons capacity remove the stone . This company has its own harbor with a loading slip . As the stone is brought from the quarry , it is crushed into pieces less than 9 inches in their maximum dimensions . Conveyor belts then carry it to storage , separate piles , receiving that to be used for open-hearth furnaces , blast furnaces , and cement plants and chemical companies . Even in the same pile the stone is graded both as to size and chemical composition . The boats used to transport this particular limestone are " self-unloaders . " One of these ? the Steamer Bradley ? is 639 feet long and has carried cargoes exceeding 16,000 gross tons.47 Moving iron ore down the lakes Ore from the Minnesota mines is loaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or 160 cars and taken to weighing and classification yards before continuing on their way to Duluth , Superior , or Two Harbors . The distance from the mines to Duluth is only 60 to 80 miles and the trains coast much of the way . The railroad charge for delivering ore from mines to boats , a distance of 79 miles , is more than that by freighters which carry it 10 times as far . If iron ore had to be transported by rail to lower Lake ports , the freight alone would be more than $8 per ton . Aside from a very small amount moving by rail to St. Louis , all three states ship their ore to lower Lake ports by water ; there is no other choice . The docks jut out into the lake like huge peninsulas . The trains , after being moved onto the docks , dump their ore into " pockets , " from which it drops by gravity through hatches into the holds of the lake vessels ( Fig. 174 ) . The docks are 72 to 84 feet above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to load a vessel , but the job has been done in much less time . In 1919 the steamer D. G. Kerr loaded 12,689 gross tons of ore in 30 minutes ' actual loading tune . When a boat reaches a lower Lake port , the ore is discharged in 4 or 5 hours by means of huge clam-shaped unloaders ( Fig. 145 ) . The Great Lakes can be utilized for only 7 or 8 months , because Footnote  |p530  the connecting links such as the " Soo " Canals are locked by ice ( Fig. 175 ) . No time is lost by a vessel during the season of navigation . Every effort is made to complete as many round trips as possible ? the number usually being 23 to 30 . It is a race against time to accumulate enough ore at the lower Lake ports to keep the mills operating throughout the year . Numerous collisions occurred prior to 1911 in hot summer months when fog was bad . Vessels on the down trip are now required to follow a slightly different course from those on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lake are at least 5 miles from each other , and are also separated so far as possible in rivers and channels . The traffic tonnage moving through the " Soo " Canals is almost unbelievable . In a normal year it exceeds that of the Panama , Suez , Welland , and New York State Barge canals combined . Nowhere else in the world is so much bulk traffic handled ? about 111 , - 000,000 net tons in 1941 ? an all-time high . In an effort to procure a return cargo , principally coal , a much lower rate is offered by northbound carriers . Most coal moving northbound from Toledo and other Lake Erie ports , however , is destined for such industrial areas as Detroit , Chicago , and Milwaukee , or for Canada rather than for the upper Lake ports . The " Soo " Canals , from the standpoint of tonnage , are the most , important artificial waterways in the world . The St. Marys River , connecting lakes Superior and Huron , is about 63 miles long and at Sault Ste. Marie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a fall of 17 to 21 feet , depending on the stage of water in the two lakes . In order to afford passage for deep-draft vessels , canals and locks having a water depth of 24 feet had to be built through this barrier . So important are they that when the canals freeze in winter . Great . Lakes traffic closes . The first " Soo " Canal was built on the Canadian side for the passage of small boats by the Northwest Fur Company in 1797 1798 . The first canal on the American side was built by the st n t e of Michigan in 1853-1855 , following the discovery of iron ore it i the Lake Superior area . This canal was transferred to the United States Government in 1881 when the Weitzel Lock was built . So great has lake traffic become that 4 locks have been built on , the American side ( Fig. 176 ) . A new one is being built on the situ of one of the old locks ? the Weitzel . It will be $0() feet long , SO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ congest ion and loss of t into awaiting lockage , permit deeper loading of ressels , and assure ade . ctua.le locking capacity for reasonably prospect commerce . ' I'la+ Dominion go ' ' ertunettt eollslrUetetI a lock and canal on the ( ' anadiui  |p531  side in 1895 , but nearly all the lake carriers use those on the American side . During the season of navigation a vessel is locked through the Soo Canals about every 15 minutes day and night . In 1941 the average was 14.4 minutes , and a record was established when 25,865 vessels passed through . Corps of Engineers , U. S. Arms . Figure Transportation The Great Lakes provide the finest system of inland waterways in the world . Their traffic consists almost entirely of bulky products ? iron ore , coal , wheat , and limestone . In 1940 during the 71/ months of lake shipping , these four commodities reached a net tonnage of 142,436,806 . The boats that move them are built solely for service on the Great Lakes and their connecting waterways . They yVoiild be useless for ocean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A sink , le ship of the largest class can carry 15,0011 IU ( i3O00 Ions . Some are self-unloaders . These boats aver-  |p532  age 11 to 13 miles per hour , makipg a round trip in approximately a week if they are engaged exclusively in the iron-ore trade and if they carry no coal upbound . If coal is carried , the time is increased by one day . Since large carriers are more economical than small ones , those being constructed now are of the more efficient 600-foot type . These are also speedier and can be loaded and unloaded in faster time . Such a vessel involves an investment of from $1,000 , - 000 to $1,500,000 . Rail and highway transportation are available , though the former is relatively unimportant , since there are few main lines . The net of branch lines built during the lumbering era is now largely abandoned , and in many instances the rails have been removed and sold for scrap . The significance of iron-ore shipments is well indicated by the fact that 99.75 per cent of the cars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably will not change , since much of the mining country appears incapable of important agricultural or other development . Hard-surface roads have had a remarkable development in the past 35 years , though much remains to be done if the subregion is to capitalize on its recreation possibilities . Especially must attention be given the scenic roads along the shores of lakes Superior , Michigan , and Huron . Agriculture Not more than 10 per cent of the Northern Lakes subregion is in crop land now , and possibly not more than 20 per cent ever can be utilized for agriculture.4t3 The crop acreage per family is too low and the tax burden too high to permit successful farming . Paucity of markets is a severe handicap in this essentially forest environment . Unfortunately , poor lands as well as good lands were sold through high-pressure salesmanship to all kinds of people ? miners , factory workers , former city white-collar employees , and Corn Belt farmers . Some accidentally obtained good land but most did not , since they " found themselves in possession of ( 1 ) outcrops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or of stump land covered with granite boulders or of ( 2 ) soil so light and sandy that , when cleared , it was blown about by the wind . " " Footnote  |p533  The majority of early farmers worked part-time in mines , mills , or logging camps . The amount of improved land on most farms ( 25 to 30 acres ) has been so small that a complete living could not be made solely by growing crops . It is unfortunate that no soil maps or agricultural experiment farms preceded immigration . Knowledge came only through trial and error and the crushing of human beings by a relentless nature ( Fig. 177 ) . A large proportion of the farmers remaining are foreign-born or of foreign parentage , being mostly Scandinavian , Slavic , or Finnish . The Finns assert that they came into this area because they were shipped up to supply labor . They took to agriculture during periods of industrial inactivity . As " part-time " farmers they have made a fair living from the soil despite the short growing season , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as indicated by their rejuvenation of farm lands abandoned by settlers of other ethnic stocks . The Finns grow primarily hay , potatoes , and root crops and leave much land in pasture . Wheat , formerly of considerable importance , is no longer grown because the area can not compete with better lands to the west and south . Most of the feed grains used on the farms are raised locally but practically none is produced for market . A typical clearing carved out of the forest consists of 20 to 30 acres planted largely in hay , with smaller plots in barley , oats , potatoes , and other vegetables . Cows and pigs are kept , the latter being fattened on skim milk . Dairying is not prosperous , because the cows require expensive winter housing . Moreover , all farm production suffers from the dearth of near-by markets . Much of the farming is submarginal . Away from the lakes , the short growing season is more of a handicap than the soils , for even on the better lands frost precludes the growing of most crops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceeding the earning power of their lands . It is just as necessary to supplement the farm income now as it was in the beginning , and most farming is " parttime . " Many farmers cut pulpwood , ties , and poles from their land . The income on the average farm is too low to maintain the American standard of living . There is a dearth of doctors , nurses , and hospitals . Medical and dental care are largely neglected , and what service there is must be largely at public expense . Few homes have electric lights or running water . Footnote  |p535  Recreation Recreation is important now and undoubtedly will be the leading industry in the future . In the 1920 's it was first realized that too much time , effort , and money had been wasted in farming worthless lands and that agriculture had no future . On the other hand , the area has all the necessary features for a great playground ? woods , lakes and streams , fish , game , cool summer climate , many good roads , and resort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half being publicly owned . The " cut-over area " is within easy driving distance from the densely populated centers of the Middle West , whose summer climate is so unbelievably trying as to drive people to the " North Woods . " But the tourist season is short , lasting only from the Fourth of July to Labor Day . Hay fever sufferers often remain somewhat longer . The recreation industry gives employment to a large number of people : to farmers who furnish milk , eggs , and vegetables , and to others who sell petroleum products , rent cottages , boats , and fishing tackle , or act as guides . It is , however , a highly seasonal industry . Manufacturing Manufacturing is not well developed in the Upper Lakes subregion because of the small population and the great distance from the continent 's principal markets for fabricated products . The chief industries are those making lumber , pulp and paper , iron and steel . Throughout the entire subregion , the general trend of industrial employment is downward . Iron and steel are made at Duluth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neither district is a major development , despite low assembly costs . Whereas most North American iron and steel districts are located close to coal and have iron ore brought to them , I these do just the reverse . Their low assembly cost is a result of the desire on the part of ship-owners to have a return cargo ; " accordingly , the cost of shipping coal up the lakes is 45 to 55 cents per ton as against 70 to SO cents for bringing ore down . ' = It is a truism that t he location of iron manufacturing is primarily a matter of freight charges , not on raw materials alone but also on the finished products lo points of consumption . Footnote  |p536  The Duluth District . In 1915 , when the plant was completed in Duluth , many journalists enthusiastically wrote , " Pittsburgh is moving west . " Yet in 1942 Pittsburgh continued as the undisputed capital of America 's and of the world 's iron and steel industry , whereas Duluth carried on as a minor producer and a keen disappointment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , did not wish to do so , realizing that Duluth was not a scientific location . Before construction , it stated that the total demand for steel in Duluth 's tributary area would not keep the plant busy 3 months in the year . Public sentiment in Minnesota , however , threatening higher taxes , forced- the issue . The district 's failure is the result of remoteness from great markets . The Sault Ste. Marie District , Canada . A steel industry was established here about 1898 . The main plant , occupying an area of 185 acres at the junction of lakes Huron and Superior , is strategically located for assembling raw materials and shipping finished products by water . The ore is imported from the United States because the quality and location of Canada 's ore do not permit profitable exploitation at the present time . ' Pulp and paper . With an abundance of pulpwood , hydro-power , ' and clear water , this area manufactures a large quantity of pulp and paper ( Fig. 22 ) . The industry , however , is not as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the value of the wood from 3 to 6 times and are invariably located close to the forest as a means of converting a bulky product into one easily transported . The pulp mills on the south shore of Lake Superior , as at Munising , get much of their pulpwood from Canada in huge rafts pulled by tugs . An effort is made to deliver these rafts during that part of the summer when winds are weakest . Without interference from storms , the rafts move at the rate of about 2 miles per hour . Following the first World War , the pulp and paper industry , along with hydro-electric power , expanded considerably in the area tributary to Fort William and Port Arthur , thereby stimulating agriculture and creating markets for agricultural commodities . Cities Few large cities are to be found in the Upper Lakes subregion . With the exception of Duluth , there is not a single one of more than 50,000 . Most of them started as sawmill towns . Footnote  |p537  The Duluth-Superior ( 157,098 ) metropolitan district is located on the western tip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ore , wheat , and lumber , surpasses that of all other Great Lakes ports . These cities have grown because they are bulk-breaking points . Duluth Chamber of Commerce . Figure Duluth and Superior , lying just across from one another at the drowned mouth of the St. Louis River , are twins . A high bluff rises immediately behind the Duluth waterfront , confining its business district to a narrow bench of land ( Fig. 178 ) . Considering the huge tonnage handled , one would expect these Pities to he larger . All cities ou Lake Superior , however , are points  |p538  of transfer rather than points of distribution . J. Russell Smith aptly calls them " funnel towns , " ' ' since their job is to pour bulky raw materials from gondola car to lake vessel and from lake vessel to gondola car . To become outstanding distributing centers , cities must have populous as well as productive hinterlands , which Duluth-Superior possibly never will possess . Fort William-Port Arthur ( 54,587 ) , twin cities lying near the western limit of navigation , vie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gigantic concrete edifices line their waterfront with storage facilities for 90,000,000 bushels of grain ( Fig. 179 ) . Here the bulk of the grain from Canada 's Spring Wheat Belt is transferred from rail to ship . Since only about 20 per cent of the wheat can get to Montreal before the navigation season closes , the rest must be stored until the following spring and summer . As many as 60 vessels , some carrying more than half a million bushels of wheat , start from Fort William and Port Arthur when navigation begins in the spring . The ports are served by both of Canada 's transcontinental railways and by several highways . Other cities are " funnel towns " ? Two Harbors ( 4,046 ) , Ashland ( 11,101 ) , Marquette ( 15,928 ) , Escanaba ( 14,830 ) ? or are mining centers ? Hibbing ( 16,385 ) , Eveleth ( 6,887 ) , Virginia ( 12,264 ) , and others . The outlook The Northern Lakes subregion is a problem area . Both from a state and a national viewpoint , these poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after removing the timber and finding the land ill-suited for farming . Others , mostly unemployed miners , stayed on in the cut-over areas and now comprise stranded populations . The cost of local government in this land of few people and large open spaces is too high to justify isolated rural living , since it requires about 3 times as much as a farmer pays in taxes merely to get his children back and forth to school , not to mention other school costs . The maintenance of schools , roads and other improvements , owing to the small number of taxpayers , exerts a problem for the states and nation . Many counties are on the " verge of insolvency . " The population should not rely upon relief permanently , for this brings little improvement in the basic condition . A way must be found to make the region self-sustaining again .
