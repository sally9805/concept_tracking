At a " shooting party " in Boston 's Algonquin club last week , Host Melvin Maynard Johnson Jr. , president of Johnson Automatics , Inc. , introduced his latest " weapon " - an indoor target gun . With it , big ( 6 ft. 4 in. ) , handsome Mel Johnson , inventor of the Johnson semi-automatic rifle and machine gun , hopes to bring the rifle range into every home . <P> The tommy-like target rifle works on the principle of the slingshot . It shoots BB-sized ball-bearing pellets , carefully machined so that they will fly straight . The propellant is a thick rubber band inside the barrel . The gun is cocked by stretching the band taut with a metal piece containing the pellet , which slides inside the barrel . The trigger releases the slide which snaps out the pellet . <P> The rifle , which has a peep sight and range and windage adjustments , is so accurate that a reasonably good shot can hit a thumbnail-sized target at 30 feet . Yet the pellet travels slowly enough to be dangerous only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captain and one of the foremost U.S. small-arms experts , holds that anyone can learn to shoot with his toy as efficiently as with an ordinary rifle . The Marine Corps and the British Government are considering them for possible use in training . One Marine Corps base has already ordered some to sell in its post exchange . In his small two-story , ivy-covered plant at Cranston , R.I. , Johnson has already turned out 10,000 rifles for sale in toy and gun stores . Retail price : $15 . With the target rifle he hopes that his company , which has been losing money since the end of the war , will hit the black .
