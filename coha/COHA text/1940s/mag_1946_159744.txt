When China 's No. 1 musician was nine years old , his parents decided that China had too little , musically , to offer him . They packed Ma Si-tson off to the Paris Conservatory . Nine years later he returned to China , to teach at Nanking , to organize Chungking 's first symphony orchestra , and to become , in no time at all , China 's best violinist . <P> During the war Ma escaped with his wife from Hong Kong to the village of Ping-shih , where he taught at the exiled Sun Yat-sen University , on a salary lower than that of a factory coolie . There he began to compose China 's first concerto . <P> Last week Ma , now 33 , heard the first performance of his Violin Concerto in F Major by the Shanghai Municipal Symphony Orchestra . The musicians , China 's finest , were white Russians and Italian and German refugees who have grudgingly admitted only one Chinese as violinist . To Western ears , the concerto ( based on South China folksongs ) was easier to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it generously , and even more generously applauded the soloist , a fact which Ma did not seem to mind . The violinist was Ma Sihon , his 22-year-old brother . Ma Si-tson 's next project : The Inferno , a symphony which will depict " all the sadness . . . which happened in these war years .
