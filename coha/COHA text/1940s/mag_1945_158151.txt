The Japanese in northern and western Burma were in full retreat last week . Only at Akyab , principal port on the west coast , and around Wanting , on the old Burma Road , were Allied troops in close contact with the retiring foe . To the British , who had been driving on Akyab for two dreary years , the disease-ridden town at the mouth of the Arakan River seemed like something at the end of a rainbow . Now they were within sight of it , and in position to contain it . <P> On the central sectors progress was uniform . British , Chinese and U.S. columns pushed south on three main routes toward Mandalay and Lashio . To the east , fighting swirled around the alternate north branch of the Burma Road . Jap suicide garrisons were entrenched in Namhkam and Wanting . But Namhkam was bypassed as a column of American-trained , U.S.-equipped Chinese troops crossed the Burma border into Ynnan . Other Chinese , from the opposite direction , were assaulting Wanting , and when this fell , the Ledo-Burma route @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China would be opened .
