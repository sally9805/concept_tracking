txt  | had been set aside for intensive research on uranium , and that some two hundred top-ranking German scientists had been ordered to devote all their energies to the problem , which had been given top priority . The Nazis were at work on an atomic bomb . At that time , as was learned later , work on the uranium problem and its possible military applications was being pushed vigorously in England . But in this country progress from a military standpoint was at first painfully slow . As Professor Henry De Wolf Smyth points out : " At that time 1939 American-born nuclear physicists were so unaccustomed to the idea of using their science for military purposes that they hardly realized what needed to be done . " Consequently , as Professor Smyth states , the early efforts both at restricting publication and at getting Government support were stimulated largely by a small group of foreign-born physicists centering on Dr. Szilard , a native of Hungary , and including Professor Eugene P. Wigner of Princeton , Professor Teller , Professor Victor F. Weisskopf of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was impossible to carry out large-scale experiments because of the unavailability of sizable amounts of U.235 , it was nevertheless realized that even with a submicroscopic sample it could be determined whether U.235 was fissionable by slow neutrons , or fast neutrons , or both . If this was found to he the case , it would serve as proof that the Bohr-Wheeler theory was correct , and that , in turn , would lend strong support to the correctness of other predictions based on the theory . The job of obtaining samples of pure U.235 was undertaken by Dr. Alfred O. Nicr of the University of Minnesota , and Drs . K. H. Kingdon and H. C. Pollock of the General Electric Company 's research laboratories at Schenectady . They built improved models of an instru- ment known as a mass spectrometer ( to be described later ) , and by March 1940 they had produced the first bits of pure U.235 that ever existed on earth . Dr. Nier managed to produce two samples " weighing " one billionth and two billionths of a gram , respectively . Drs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundredth of a millionth of a gram . At their rate of production it would have taken thousands of years to concentrate one gram , but those infinitesimal amounts , the most precious bits of metal in the world , were enough for the purpose . In a sense they were the first atomic bombs . The samples were rushed to Columbia University , where they were subjected to bombardment by slow neutrons produced by the cyclotron . Those first historic tests were carried out by Drs . E. T. Booth , Dunning , and A. V. Grosse . The first sample , produced by Dr. Nier , was tested on March 3 , 1940 ; the second , obtained by Drs . Kingdon and Pollock , on March 20 ; a third , concentrated by Dr. Nier , was tested on April 3 . These tests established definitely that only U.235 could be split by slow neutrons , and that U.238 could be split only by fast neutrons , exactly as Drs . Bohr and Wheeler had predicted . Other tests in other laboratories soon revealed that U.238 eats up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it ( intermediate neutrons ) , and therefore would not sustain a chain reaction . By June 1940 , another fact of the utmost importance for later developments became generally known both here and abroad . It was found that U.235 could be split not only by slow neutrons but by fast neutrons as well . Since slow neutrons do not occur naturally and require large quantities of a light element to serve as a moderator , it would be impossible to employ them in a bomb ,  | as such a bomb would have to be of enormous dimensions . Furthermore , the reaction would be too slow . On the other hand , fast neutrons , if there were enough of them to sustain a chain reaction , could create an explosion of unprecedented violence in a small amount of U.235 . If there were enough of them to sustain a chain reaction ? there was the rub . Nobody knew for certain whether there were , and yet this was the very heart of the problem . To find out whether a chain reaction with fast neutrons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be necessary , and that would take millions of years to produce by the best methods then known , unless hundreds of millions of dollars were to be spent to build mammoth plants that might or might not work . It was a vicious circle : no fastneutron chain reaction could be demonstrated without sizable amounts of U.235 , but no such amounts could even be dreamed of unless it could be demonstrated with a reasonable degree of certainty that a self-sustaining chain reaction would take place . But how about using the unseparated U.235 in a natural mixture of uranium ? Since fast neutrons would split both U.238 and 11.235 , why not take just a big block of uranium as found in nature , remove the neutron-absorbing impurities , and let a stray neutron start a chain re-action ? Luckily for the world , this was not possible because of the existence of the " friendly cannibal " in the U.238 . Tests revealed that the number of neutrons captured and devoured by him without splitting would be great enough to prevent any chain reaction . How about slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whereas the probability of U.235 being split by slow neutrons had been found to be  | greater than the likelihood of its being split by fast neutrons . These two factors should lead to a vast increase in the number of neutrons available to split more atoms , and the greater the number of atoms split , the greater the number of neutrons born . And if the birth rate of the neutrons available for further fissions is higher than their death rate , then a self-perpetuating chain reaction should take place in the U.235 even without separating it from the U.238 . In other words , with slow neutrons ordinary uranium , as found in nature , could be used for determining whether enough neutrons were born through fission to maintain a self-perpetuating chain reaction . If that was found to be so , it would serve as an indication that a chain reaction in U.235 could be maintained also with fast neutrons . For in a natural unseparated mixture of U.238 and U.235 the cannibal in the U.238 would still swallow a great many of the neutrons when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their being slowed down to low speeds . On the other hand , in pure U.235 , which has no pronounced cannibalistic traits , nearly all the neutrons would be available for further fission and the production of an uncontrolled chain reaction ? namely , a nuclear explosion . The idea of testing the possibilities of a chain reaction with slow neutrons in U.235 unseparated from natural uranium occurred independently to Dr. Szilard , Dr. Fermi , and their associates at Columbia , as well as to scientists in England , shortly after the discovery of uranium fission was announced . It offered enormous obstacles , but it was the only way in which the feasibility of an atomic bomb could be proved by experiment , and without such proof there would be no justification for the enormous expenditures that would be entailed . As it turned out later , the decision to go all out on the Atomic Bomb Project was made a year before such proof had  | been obtained ; but by that time strong circumstantial evidence was already available , and in the face of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mr. Henry L. Stimson , when he was Secretary of War : " The decision to embark on largescale production at such an early stage was , of course , a gamble , but , as is so necessary in war , a calculated risk was taken and the risk paid off . " And so at Columbia University , behind a thick veil of self-imposed secrecy , Drs . Szilard and Fermi , working at first independently along different lines , but joining forces later in a team that included Drs . Anderson and Zinn , George Weil and B. Feld , began work on the design of a structure in which , they hoped , a chain reaction with slow neutrons could be made to operate in an unseparated natural mixture of U.235 and U.238 . One of the first obstacles to be overcome was to find a suitable moderator for slowing down the neutrons . To serve as a neutron-moderator a substance has to be of light atomic weight ( to produce clastic collisions ) , it must not absorb too many neutrons , it must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too difficult to handle . Drs . Szilard and Fermi came to the conclusion that graphite , the soft carbon used in lead pencils , best met all the requirements . As Professor Smyth points out , it had occurred to a number of physicists that it might be possible to mix uranium with a moderator in such a way that the highspeed neutrons produced by fission , after being ejected from the uranium and before re-encountering other uranium nuclei , would have their speeds reduced below the speeds at which capture by the cannibal in U.238 is highly probable . But while the general scheme of using  | a moderator mixed with the uranium was pretty obvious , Drs . Szilard and Fermi worked out a specific manner of using such a moderator , which laid the foundation for the gigantic atomic power plants , or " piles , " later erected at the Hanford Engineer Works near Pasco , Washington . It was their idea to build a gigantic lattice in which large lumps of natural uranium are embedded in a matrix of graphite as a moderator of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basic design later utilized so successfully in the atomic piles producing atomic bomb material . Such a pile consists of large blocks of the purest graphite ever made , piled up in a structure forming an enormous cube . Channels spaced at definite intervals in these graphite blocks , which give it the appearance of a giant honeycomb , are filled with lumps of uranium metal . Enormous volumes of water circulating through the channels carry away the tremendous quantities of heat in which the energy liberated by the split atoms of U.235 manifests itself . In such a structure , if the proper dimensions are attained , the chain reaction starts in the following manner : Some stray neutrons from within or without the pile split some atoms of the U.235 in the mixture . The split atoms liberate from one to three neutrons each , some of which are swallowed by the U.238 while others pass through the graphite , which slows them down . These slow neutrons , in turn , split other U.235 atoms , which liberate more neutrons , which split more atoms . The geometrical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred neutrons that go into splitting U.235 atoms a little more than a hundred fission-producing neutrons are emitted . The ratio of the number of fission-producing neutrons in the second gen- eration to the number of fission-producing neutrons in the first generation is known as the multiplication factor , and is designated by the letter K. If , for example , 100 neutrons that had caused fission in a hundred U.235 atoms produced a brood of new neutrons of which 105 were left to cause fission , a ratio of 105 to 100 , then the K factor would have a value of 1.05 . If this factor is constant , then the third generation of fission-producing neutrons will be 105 multiplied by 1.05 , and so on ad infinitum . When the K factor is greater than one , the pile will be chain-reacting , as the birth rate will be greater than the death rate . On the other hand , if 100 fission-producing neutrons give birth to only 99 , then the K factor will be 0.99-that is , less than one , not enough to maintain a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design of the first experimental pile , only minute amounts of uranium in metallic form were in existence , and no satisfactory method for its large-scale production , particularly in the high degree of purity required , was known . This was true also of graphite , for while graphite was plentiful , the available product contained too many neutron-absorbing inipurit ics f o serve t he purpose . In spite of these seemingly insiirmoitntable obstacles , the Columbia group managed to get together enough crude material to erect their first pile in July 1941 . It was a graphite cube of about eight feet on edge , and contained about seven tons of ur:minm oxide ( compound of uranium and oxygen ) in iron containers distributed at equal intervals throughout the graphite . Similar structures of somewhat larger size were set up in September and October . Since the first piles were too small , because of the lack of sufficient material , and the uranium and graphite contained many impurities , they were not expected to pro- duce a chain reaction . Much fundamental information , however , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bigger and better piles . To make up for the shortage of neutrons , and for making comparative studies of the number of neutrons captured by the uranium and the impurities , as well as of the new neutrons produced through fission , the Columbia group placed near the bottom of the uranium-graphite lattice an artificial neutron source , consisting of a combination of radium and beryllium . The neutrons in this combination are emitted from the nuclei of the beryllium when they are struck by the alpha particles that are constantly being ejected from the radium nuclei . In this type of structure , known as an " exponential pile , " the neutrons are counted at various points throughout the lattice when no uranium is present in the graphite matrix , and the results are then compared with the number of neutrons emitted at the same points after the uranium has been put in place . The absorption of neutrons by the cannibal in the U.238 would , of course , tend to decrease their numbers , whereas the liberation of neutrons in the splitting of the U.235 atoms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determine which of these two opposing processes predominates . For more than a year preceding the building of the first exponential pile , physicists at Columbia and at Princeton had been developing highly ingenious techniques for detecting neutrons and for measuring the amounts of their absorption by graphite and uranium oxide . By these methods they were enabled to detect and count not only the total number of neutrons emitted by a given system , but also to screen them in such a way as to count the neutrons according to their energy levels . In other words , they could distinguish between neutrons of high , intermediate , and low speeds .  | In these studies it was found , for example , that the fast neutrons emitted in the process of fission , traveling at speeds of thousands of miles per second , are slowed down to the speed of thermal neutrons , going at only one mile per second , after being made to pass through forty centimeters ( sixteen inches ) of graphite . Since neutrons at this speed are the most efficient for producing fission , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the graphite matrix sixteen inches apart . In other words , it provided a blueprint for the geometrical pattern of the lattice . By these techniques it was also possible to obtain approximations of the total number of neutrons that would escape through the walls of a graphite block of given dimensions , how many would be absorbed by the graphite itself , and how many neutrons of intermediate energies would be captured by the U.238 cannibal . Since these absorptions vary with the speed of the neutrons , each element absorbing neutrons of only specific energy ranges , measurements also had to be made to determine the various energy levels of the neutrons absorbed in the uranium-graphite system . To provide a large source of neutrons for these experiments , protons ? namely , nuclei of hydrogen atoms ? were accelerated by means of a cyclotron and made to impinge upon a beryllium target . The neutrons thus liberated from the beryllium were equivalent to the yield of a beryllium target bombarded by the alpha particles from 3,500 grams ( nearly eight pounds ) of radium . This is greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the pre-war price of $25,000 per gram , such a quantity would be worth $87,500,000 . Most significant of all , by these techniques the Columbia and Princeton physicists ( the latter including Drs . Wigner and Wheeler ) were able to determine the num- bcr of neutrons emitted for each slow neutron entering the U.235 . It was found that there was a little cannibal even in the U.235 , so that not every neutron that enters it causes fission . Nevertheless , the studies showed that the decrease was not great enough to make a chain reaction impossible . It largely depended on how big was the appetite of the cannibal in the U.238 . The data obtained gave reason to hope that if he devoured not much more than half of the average number of neutrons disgorged by the U.235 , the balance would be great enough to maintain a chain reaction . The problem was outlined by Professor Fermi in a lecture before the American Institute of Electrical Engineers in New York on January 24 , 1940 . " In order that a chain reaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " it is obviously necessary not only to have more than one neutron produced for every neutron that is absorbed in the fission , but also to be able to utilize for producing new fissions a large fraction of the neutrons produced ; otherwise the loss might be larger than the gain . Assuming that two neutrons are produced in every fission , it is evident that for the chain reaction to take place more than one half of the neutrons produced must be used in new fission processes . " Actually , Dr. Fermi said , " experiment shows that probably the average number of neutrons emitted is somewhat larger , between two and three . " Interpretations of the experimental data obtained from the exponential pile , involving many corrections , calculations , and approximations , gave a discouraging outlook . With the impure materials at hand , these data showed , a pile of infinite dimensions ? that is , one from which no neutrons leaked away through its sides ? would have a neutron birth rate of only 87 per 100 . That meant a multiplication factor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaction .  | It was universally agreed that an increase in the purity of the materials , improvements in the lattice arrangement , and other factors would almost certainly lead to an increase in the multiplication factor . But even if limitless amounts of pure metallic uranium and the purest of graphite were suddenly made available , no one at that time could state whether a multiplication factor greater than one would be achieved . There were many other discouraging factors . A number of fires broke out during the experiments , endangering the lives of the experimenters and necessitating fresh starts . In October 1941 a sphere of seventeen kilograms of powdered metal blew up in Dr. Zinn 's hands , and he was severely burned . IIe was forced to spend three months in a hospital . But the experiments continued . The scientists began referring to the elusive multiplication factor greater than one as " the Great God K. " If " the Great God K " existed , he had certainly managed to hide himself very successfully . Was lie a reality or only a tantalizing myth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refused to tell . But unless proof of his existence could be found , there could be no atomic bomb and tlne vision of atomic power would be but a delusion . " The slicer cussedness of nature ! " Professor Fermi sighed .  | AN important event in 1941 intensified the search for the multiplication factor greater than one . A group of workers at the Radiation Laboratory of the University of California bombarded uranium 238 with neutrons of intermediate speeds and discovered that these neutrons transformed the U.238 into an entirely new element , not known to exist in nature , which they named plutonium . How this remarkable achievement was accomplished is a story in itself to be told hereinafter , but one outstanding fact about plutonium has a vital bearing on what is being related here : tests on the new uranium offspring gave definite proof of an earlier conjecture that plutonium has the same fissionable properties as U.235 , so that it could be used as a substitute of equal , if not even greater , efficiency . It is impossible to overestimate the significance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and chemists ( most of them still in their early twenties ) , as it opened the way for the first time to fissionable material in large quantities . In the separation of one element from another , advantage is taken of the difference in chemical properties between the two elements , which makes possible the employment of chemical means for large-scale separation . Since U.238 and U.235 have the same chemi- cal properties , they could therefore not be separated by chemical means , whereas methods taking advantage of the slight difference in their atomic weight would yield , by the methods then known , only insignificant amounts . Plutonium , on the other hand , was an entirely different element from uranium , hence possessing entirely different chemical properties , which made it possible to employ chemical methods for its separation from the U.238 parent in large quantities . In a word , it meant that the material for an atomic bomb could be made available in time for use in the war . The first submicroscopic bits of plutonium were produced by neutrons knocked out from beryllium by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infinitesimal amounts could be produced . But the fact that a neutron entering U.238 converts it automatically in a series of steps into plutonium proved beyond the shadow of a doubt that that is exactly what happens when the cannibal in the U.238 swallows a neutron . This had been suspected all along , but now there was conclusive experimental proof that it was an absolute fact . What that meant was that , if you could manage to build a chainreacting pile , it might be possible to arrange it so that one out of every two neutrons emitted in the fission process from the U.235 would go into splitting another U.235 atom and thus keep the chain reaction going , while the second neutron would be captured by the cannibal and convert the U.238 into plutoniumn , which would be better than the U.235 since it could be separated by chemical means in quantities large enough for use in atomic bombs . Moreover , an even more far-reaching possibility suggested itself concerning the use of a controlled chain reaction for the development of atomic power . The natural supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  | each ton of natural uranium containing only fourteen pounds ( seven tenths of one per cent ) . But the discovery of plutonium promised to make up more than a hundredfold for the niggardliness of nature . For , again on the assumption that half of the neutrons emitted by the fission of the U.235 in the pile would go into the making of plutonium , this would mean that for every atom of U.235 split , an atom of plutonium would be created . In other words , after the fourteen pounds of the U.235 in each ton of natural uranium had been completely used up through fission , fourteen pounds of plutonium would have taken their place . You would eat your cake and have it too . Since the experiments with plutonium at California indicated that , like U.235 , it would also undergo fission with slow neutrons , this meant that after the U.235 in the pile was all used up , the plutonium would take its place in perpetuating the chain reaction exactly as before , so that when the fourteen pounds of plutonium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by an equal amount of the substance . In this manner the chain reaction could be kept going in the pile as long as there was any uranium left . In other words , all the 1,986 pounds per ton of U.238 in the pile would be eventually converted into plutonium , thus increasing the original amount of fissionable material by 140 times . This , of course , would mean a corresponding increase in the amount of atomic energy extracted from the pile , provided the plutonium had not in the meantime been removed for atomic bombs . All these possibilities were reported on July 11 , 1941 by Professor Lawrence , in a memorandum to the Committee of the National Academy of Sciences , which was then studying the uranium problem . This report played a major role in expediting Government support of the  | Atomic Bomb Project on an all-out basis , and therefore must rank as one of our great historic documents . Following are pertinent excerpts : An extremely important new possibility has been opened for the exploitation of the chain reaction with unseparated isotopes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of California have indicated ( a ) that element 94 i.e. , plutonium is formed as a result of the capture of a neutron by uranium 238 followed by two successive emissions of electrons ( beta transformations ) , and furthermore ( b ) that this trans-manic element undergoes slow neutron fission and therefore presumably behaves like uranium 235 . If this is so , the following three outstanding important possibilities are opened : 1 . Uranium 238 would be available for energy production , thus increasing about one hundredfold the total atomic energy obtainable from a given quantity of uranium . 2 . Using element 94 one may envisage preparation of chain reaction units for power purposes weighing perhaps a hundred pounds instead of a hundred tons , as probably would be necessary for units using natural uranium . 3 . If large amounts of element 94 were available it is likely that a chain reaction with fast neutrons could be produced . In such a reaction the energy would he released at an explosive rate which might be described as a " sillier bomb . " At about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working at the Cavendish Laboratory , Cambridge , had ( as the Official British Report stated later ) " produced strong evidence , by December , 1940 , that , in a system composed of uranium oxide , or uranium metal , with heavy water ' as the slowingdown medium ( i.e. , moderator ) , a divergent slow neutron fission chain reaction would be realized if the system were of sufficient size . " At that time , the British report adds , " it seemed likely that , if uranium metal were used , this critical size would involve not more than a few tons of heavy water . ' "  | This news from Britain , coupled with the news from the University of California , galvanized our scientists into action . For it was realized at once that the Nazis , through their rape of Norway , had gained possession of the world 's largest plant for the manufacture of heavy water , and it was certain that they were using it as a moderator for a uranium chain-reaction pile . And since it was now almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amounts , it became once again likely that the Nazis might after all be able to produce atomic bombs in time for use against England , and also against Russia , which they had invaded in the summer of 1941 . It looked as though the cannibal in uranium was not friendly after all . In fact , the latest developments revealed him to be no cannibal at all . He was at the same time both a blessing and a curse , a Dr. Jekyll and a Mr. Hyde . There was good reason to fear that Mr. Hyde was likely to ain dominance over Dr. Jekyll , for until November 11 , nearly three years after the discovery of fission , we had approved a total of only $300,000 on projects for uranium , a mere trifle compared with the magnitude and importance of the subject , and it therefore seemed likely that the Nazis had got a head start on us in a race in which their opponents were trotting while they were galloping . At that time the results of another study by Professors Wigner and Smyth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into which the U.235 splits are highly radioactive , and since they differ chemically from uranium , it was realized that they could be extracted and used as a " particularly ' vicious form of poison gas . " In their report Drs . Wigner and Smyth stated that " the fission products produced in one day 's run of a 100,000-kilowatt chain-reacting pile might be sufficient to make a large area uninhabitable. "  | As Dr. Smyth hastens to point out , neither he nor Dr. Wigner recommended the use of radioactive poisons , nor has such use been seriously proposed since then by the responsible authorities . But , he adds , " serious consideration was given to the possibility that the Germans might make surprise use of radioactive poisons , and accordingly defensive measures were planned . " With all these dark clouds gathering on the horizon , our top scientists called a council of war . It was December 6 , 1941 , the day before " the day that will live in infamy . " President Conant , who officially represented Dr. Bush , announced two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtaining atomic bombs for use in the present war was great enough to justify an all out ' effort . " The second was that the project was of such a magnitude that it required an entirely different type of organization from the one in existence at that time . And so it was that on December 6 the decisions were taken that led to the end of the war that began a few hours later on the morning of December 7 . On November 7 , 1942 a small group of men began assembling a huge collection of lumps of uranium and bricks of graphite into a spherical structure designed to force the Great God K to reveal himself . With the bricks and lumps of uranium and graphite , purer and more plentiful than ever before , they were building a gigantic latticework in which , they hoped , a cosmic fire would be lighted by a cosmic ray from interstellar space , and be kept burning by an endless relay of neutrons that would be liberated from split atoms of uranium 235 . It was to be , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first self-sustaining chain-reaction pile ever made . The scene of their labors was a gloomy squash court underneath the West Stands of Stagg Field on the Uni- versity of Chicago campus . No one passing the staid , ivycovered neo-Gothic building on Ellis Avenue , between Fifty-sixth and Fifty-seventh streets , could have had the slightest inkling of what was going on inside . In fact , so great was the secrecy in which the work was shrouded that not even the president and trustees of the university knew what a hazardous venture was being made on their premises . And it was just as well , for their unawareness no doubt spared them many a sleepless night . Much had happened since that historic day before Pearl Harbor as a result of the decision to go all out on atomic energy for military purposes . The sneak attack the day after lent even greater urgency to the undertaking . One of the first steps was to set up three great research centers , at Columbia University , the University of Chicago , and the University of California , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Arthur H. Compton , and Ernest O. Lawrence , all Nobel prize winners . Those at Columbia and California were to be devoted to research and development of large-scale methods for the separation of U.235 . The one at Chicago , which was named the Metallurgical Project , was to develop methods for the production and separation of plutonium . This , of course , meant the development of selfsustaining chain-reacting piles . The Columbia group , including Drs . Szilard , Fermi , Anderson , Zinn , and Weil , as well as the Princeton group , including Drs . Wheeler and Wigner , who had been working on the pile problems , and scores of topranking nuclear physicists from our university laboratories , were therefore transferred to Chicago early in 1942 and went to work at once on plans for building a pile . Since they were still hampered by the lack of pure uranium and graphite , they continued their investigations along the lines started at Columbia and Princeton , and  | in this way gained much additional knowledge on how to ferret out the Great God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graphite had to be solved at the earliest possible date . So , on learning that the Westinghouse company had been producing small amounts of metallic uranium for research purposes , Dr. Compton called Dr. Harvey C. Rentschler , Westinghouse director of research , on the telephone . " How soon can Westinghouse supply three tons of pure uranium ? " Dr. Compton asked . Dr. Rentschler was aghast ; the total output of pure uranium metal up to that time had been a few grams . But he was assured by Dr. Compton that a large amount was needed urgently for a vital , highly secret war project , so Dr. Rentschler and his assistant , l ) r . John W. Marden , set up a makeshift laboratory for the production of " metal X. " Within a few months they had increased production from eight ounces a day to more than five hundred pounds and cut the cost from a thousand dollars a pound to twenty-two dollars . The three tons Dr. Compton had asked for were delivered by November 1942 . Other companies began production , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one per cent impurities began coining in at the rate of fifteen tons a month . A new and simpler process for purifying uranium ore , developed at the National Bureau of Standards by Dr. James I. Hoffman , was put in operation by the Mallinckrodt Chemical Works of St. Louis under the direction of Dr. John R. Ruhoff , who , as Colonel Ruhoff , was later in charge of procurement of metal for the Manhattan Engineer District , as the Atomic Bomb Project was known . As a result an additional thirty tons of oxide a month became available by July 1942 . The Harshaw Chemical Company in Cleveland and the du Pont plant at Penns Grove , New Jersey , prepared , by a new simpler  | process , the raw materials for final purification by the Westinghouse company , which had been doing this work by a rather slow and costly method . Similar steps were taken to obtain graphite of the highest possible purity . Following suggestions made by the National Bureau of Standards , the National Carbon Company and the Speer Carbon Company began producing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that absorbed twenty per cent fewer neutrons than the best standard commercial material previously available . By July enough purified uranium oxide from Mallinckrodt had become available to build an improved exponential pile , the ninth in a series of what were known as intermediate piles . The pile was not the right kind for a chain reaction , but the results obtained caused elation among the workers . Earlier tests in May had already revealed that the purified materials increased the neutron multiplication factor K from 0.87 to 0.98 . Now for the first time calculations based on the data showed that in a theoretical " infinitely large " pile , from which no neutrons leaked away from the sides , the K factor would be 1.007 , a value greater than one . Even before this experiment , Dr. Compton had predicted that a neutron multiplication factor " somewhere between 1.04 and 1.05 could be obtained in a pile of highly purified uranium oxide and graphite , provided that the air was removed from the pile to avoid neutron absorption by nitrogen . " In the fall of 1942 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uranium , developed independently by Professor Frank H. Spedding and his associates at Iowa State College , Ames , Iowa , and by Clement J. Rodden at the National Bureau of Standards , was introduced , and by the end of November more than one ton of metal had been produced by this method at  | a plant set up at Ames . Lumps of this product , the purest so far made , became known as " Spedding 's eggs . " By November 7 a total of 12,400 pounds of pure uranium metal had been collected at the West Stands squash court . In addition there were many more tons of uranium oxide , and tons of graphite , both of a higher ' purity than ever before . Calculations on critical sizethat is , the size at which the number of free neutrons produced by fission is just equal to the total lost by nonfission capture and by escape through the surface ? assured them that they at last had enough uranium and graphite of sufficient purity to make a chain-reacting pile possible . They approached their task @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but as human beings realizing the implications of success in this particular adventure , they were hoping , Dr. Compton told me , that they would fail . Though all their calculations seemed to point to success , they could by no means be certain . The calculations involved many corrections , approximations , and interpretations , and hence there was the likelihood of error somewhere along the line . Some miscalculation , some wrong in ! ( 1 ) rct at ion , might vitally affect the result . Keeping in mind I ) r . Compton 's prediction that they would meet with success " provided that the air was removed from the pile to avoid neutron absorption by nitrogen , " they began building their pile inside a huge square balloon , from which the air could be pumped out later . Every other detail had been carefully attended to . They had figured out the dimensions that would be required to obtain the critical size ? that is , the size at which enough neutrons would be liberated inside to make up for all possible losses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for normal use in operating the pile as well as for emergencies if something unforeseen happened . The squash court was full of all sorts of sensitive devices for counting neutrons . These neutron-counters were , in fact , the instruments that were to reveal the presence of the Great God K as soon as he arrived , if he ever did ; for by counting the neutrons from one generation to the next they would be able to tell whether the generations of fission-producing neutrons kept multiplying themselves by a constant factor greater than one or whether their death rate was greater than their birth rate . They knew only too well that without some system of birth control for neutrons an uncontrolled chain reaction might develop in which the neutrons would multiply in geometric progression so rapidly as to cause disaster for all concerned . Not that they were likely to produce an explosion even approximating that of an atomic bomb , as that could not happen except with fast neutrons liberated in a critical mass of either pure U.235 or plutonium , under special prearranged conditions . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large mass of uranium would liberate great quantities of atomic energy in the form of heat , and this heat , if allowed to become great enough , might vaporize the uranium and graphite in the center of the pile , and the vapor produce such tremendous pressure that it would explode the pile and the West Stands as well into a fiery cloud of uraniumgraphite dust . And that would be only part of the story . The extremely hot metal vapor might cause a Chicago fire even more disastrous than the one started by Mrs. O'Leary 's cow ; for the tremendous radioactivity of the flaming vapor would prevent firefighters from getting anywhere near the flames . Not only that , but the radioactive poi- sons that would be scattered over a wide area by the explosions would make the Chicago University campus and a large part of Chicago 's South Side uninhabitable for some time . But the builders of the pile were not taking any such risks . In fact , it would have been impossible even to attempt to build a pile were it not for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elements in particular , boron and cadmium , are voracious eaters of neutrons . So , as the pile was built up layer by layer , strips of cadmium and rods of boron steel were inserted at regular intervals in such a way as to make certain , to the best of their knowledge , that the number of neutrons would never rise beyond a desired level . Since up to then atomic energy was being liberated in large amounts only in the sun and the stars , the pile they were building , which was to light an atomic fire for the first time on earth , was , in a sense , a miniature model of the sun or a star . As a cradle for the star about to be born they laid a timber framework resting on the squash-court floor . The structure was to be , properly enough , a sphere , as that was calculated to yield the best results . The uraniummetal and uranium-oxide lumps were to be spaced in a cubic lattice , embedded in graphite . The graphite was cut in bricks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the square graphite bricks in each alternate layer they placed the uranium lumps . The lumps of the six tons of the pure metal were placed in the center of the structure . Surrounding it was a latticework of graphite bricks , at the corners of which were placed lumps of purified uranium oxide . Ten slots passed completely through the pile . Three of these near the center were to hold boron-steel rods for purposes of safety and control . The others were to hold  | neutron-absorbing cadmium strips for additional safety and for experimentation . Actually , any one of the cadmium strips alone could dispose of enough unwanted neutrons to keep the expected chain reaction within bounds . All that would be necessary to bring the neutron birth rate down to a desired level , at which it could not get out of hand , would be to push the cadmium strip to a measured distance within the pile , each centimeter of strip absorbing a definite number of neutrons . Conversely , to bring the birth rate up to the level at which the multiplication factor greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pull the strip out a definite measured distance . One of the three safety rods was to be operated automatically by two electric motors , which pushed the rod in when the intensity of the reaction increased above the desired level , and pulled it out when it was decreased below that level . Both within the pile and near it were placed instruments for measuring the intensity of neutrons at any given moment . A remote-control room was set up for use if it was found necessary to shut off the main room ( where the pile was ) because of lethal radiations . From the very beginning the cadmium strips and boron-steel rods were placed in " retard " position to make certain that the desired multiplication factor did not appear by surprise . This later turned out to be very fortunate indeed , for it actually arrived much earlier than was expected . The work proceeded from early morning ? until late at night for twenty-four days . With each layer the total number of the neutrons born in the first generation was found tube greater than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to of increase was not great enough to maintain a chain reaction , as the multiplication factor K was  | in each case less than one . For each one hundred neutrons that produced fission , less than one hundred new fission-producing neutrons were being born . Things were still going at about the same pace on December 1 , when the eleventh layer was completed . The sphere was then nearly three-quarters complete and still there was no sign of a multiplication factor greater than one . Late that evening Dr. Fermi , who had been given the name Dr. Farmer for security reasons , had gone to bed . Dr. Zinn and the others stayed on working into the night . Somehow as they worked on , piling up the bricks of the twelfth layer , they thought they heard a marked change in the tempo of the clicks from the neutron-counters . With each brick the tempo seemed to increase . The neutrons were definitely coming out at a faster rate . Click , click , click . " We knew then , " Dr. Zinn told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rods , the thing would pop . But we did not want to wake Dr. Fermi . " It was unthinkable to open the show in his absence . They were there early as usual the next morning , one of the coldest in Chicago . The squash court was badly heated , but the atomic bricklayers carried on in total ob ! livion of the cold and the gloom . I ) r . Zinn was master of ceremonies that colt ( December 2 . Present were Drs . Fermi , Szilard , Anderson , Weil , Compton , Wigner , Samuel K. Allison , N. I lilbcrry , Volncy C. Wilson , John Marshall . There was one young woman in the group , Leona Woods , who later became Mrs. Marshall . Everyone present gradually became aware that one of the great moments in history was near . The neutrons were being born at a rate faster than had been anticipated for the twelfth layer of the structure . The calculations had apparently been on the conservative side . By noon they were agreed that the goal might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first self-sustaining chainreacting pile in the history of man , generating atomic energy , might be a reality . And then Fermi , the imperturbable , said : " Let 's go to lunch ! " The room became empty and silent . The pile looked grotesque in its balloon , which had been found not to be necessary after all . Meantime , three blocks away , a momentous conference had been in progress since early that morning in Room 209 , Eckhert Hall , on the University of Chicago campus . Among the group were Dr. Crawford H. Greenewait , chemical engineer , a member of the board of directors of the E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company , Inc. ; Roger Williams , assistant general manager of the du Pont explosives department ; Warren K. Lewis , professor of chemical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ; and T. C. Gary , also of the du Pont staff . They had been selected for their engineering background as a reviewing committee to appraise the entire Chicago Metallurgical Project . None of them had the slightest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In particular , they were discussing what was no doubt the strangest proposal ever made to the heads of a large industrial plant . The du Pont company had been asked by General Groves , who less than three months earlier had been placed at the head of the newly created Man . hattan Engineer D'strict , to undertake the construction and operation of la e-scale plants , to cost hundreds of millions of dollars , for the production of plutonium and its chemical separation from its uranium parent . No such problem had ever before confronted a group of practical engineers and industrialists . They had been asked to con , struct a type of plant that nobody had ever built , to manufacture a product that had been made only in submicroscopic amounts , which nobody was sure could ever  | be made in quantity . Worse still , the only way to produce plutonium on a large scale was through a self-sustaining chain reaction , and yet there had been no definite experimental proof that such a chain reaction was possible . And even if they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engineering problems of a revolutionary nature , and managed to operate them successfully in the production of plutonium , it might still take years to work out a method for its concentration . How was one going to design plants for chemical procedures that still remained to be worked out ? And yet , as the discussion in Eckhert Hall proceeded that morning and continued in the afternoon , all these difficulties faded into insignificance in the face of one ominous possibility . We were at war . Our very existence was at stake . The Nazis had had a head start on us . All indications were that a chain reaction was definitely possible , and we could not afford to lose any more time . In a war for survival one must take calculated risks . The design and construction of operating plants must go on simultaneously with the laboratory experiments . That was a revolutionary concept never heard of before in industry . And there was the farther handicap that because of the strict secrecy ordered by President Roosevelt , the industrialists could not be told what was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When Dr. Fermi and his trap- came hack from luncheon and it appeared that the work was about to reach a climax , Dr. Compton obtained permission to invite one , and only one , of the group at Eckhcrt Hall to witness the proceedings . He called Dr. Greenewalt on the telephone . " Could you come over to the squash court below the West Stands of Stagg Field without delay ? " Dr. Compton asked . " Do n't ask any questions and tell no one where you are going . " As Dr. Greenewalt arrived ,  | the last pure uranium eggs were being placed in the corners of the graphite bricks . Dr. Compton made hurried explanations in whispers . The job was nearly done . They were still not quite out of the woods , however . Nobody was sure just how sensitive the controls were . There might still be a last-minute catastrophe . So extraspecial precautions were taken . Two young physicists in the group , Dr. Alvin C. Graves , of the University of Texas , and Harold V. Lichtenberger , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serve in what their colleagues referred to as a suicide brigade . They stood in silence on a high platform overlooking the pile , each holding a bucket full of a potent cadmium solution , ready to quench any fire that might start if the cadmium and boron bonds were broken . For two hours they stood there , waiting for a signal to go into action , hoping the while that the nerves and muscles of mere humans would respond quickly enough . As the pile-builders were approaching what they suspected might be critical size , they proceeded more and more cautiously . A careful check was made on the automatic controls in the balcony . After the last egg had been deposited in its graphite nest , all the cadmium strips but one were pulled out . The last one was then pulled out slowly to the proper distant . The suicide brigade stood on the alert . Faster came the eutrons and more frequent were the clicks of the coun ers ? eight hundred , nine hundred , a thousand , eleven hundred . Intently they stood around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neutrons per minute . In the eleventh layer the count of the first generation of neutrons had stopped at eight hundred . If it now rose to only a little more than sixteen hundred per minute they would know that a multiplication factor greater than one had been reached . Click , click , click ? twelve hundred , fourteen hundred ,  | sixteen hundred . And then there came a still small voice : sixteen hundred and one . Two , three , four , five . Six , seven , eight . Nine , ten . The atomic age had come in on tiptoe . The fission-producing neutrons were multiplying themselves by a constant factor of 1.0006 ; for each neutron that went into the splitting of one U.235 atom , more than one neutron was being born to carry on . A self-perpetuating chain reaction , and with it the dream of atomic power , had become a reality . It was 3.30 in the afternoon of December 2 , 1942 . Along with the hour of 5.30 of the morning of July 16 , 1945 , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man as one of the two distinct birthdays of the Atomic Age ? one marking the birth of atomic energy in a controlled reaction with slow neutrons ; the other marking its birth in an uncontrolled chain reaction with fast neutrons . As the critical size required to sustain a chain reaction had been found to be fully twenty-five per cent smaller ' than had been expected , the scientists added just one more layer , the thirteenth , for luck , and called it a day . In its final appearance this first man-made star was thus an incomplete sphere , flat at the top , a shape geometers call an oblate spheroid . As such it may be said to be a miniature model of the earth , except that it is flattened only at its North Pole . Dr. Greenewalt lost no time rushing back to Room 209 , Eckhert Hall , where the discussion of whether it would be wise for the du Pont company to undertake the construction of giant chain-reacting piles for the large-scale production of plutonium was still going on . " Gentlemen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for further discussion . " He had been sworn to absolute secrecy , so he could not tell anything about what he had seen . But , as Dr. Compton said , " though Greeney did  | not say anything , all you had to do was to look at him . Greeney 's eyes popped , " Dr. Compton added . And as the reviewing committee decided then and there to recommend to the du Pont company to proceed with plans for designing , building , and operating mammoth piles for producing plutonium ( which were completed two years later , under a dollar-a-year contract , at the Hanford Engineer Works , near Pasco , Washington , at a cost of nearly $400,000,000 ) , Dr. Compton held a short long-distance conversation with Dr. Conant . " The Italian navigator has arrived in the New World and found the continent much smaller than he thought it was , " said Dr. Compton . " I hope the natives received him kindly , " said Dr. Conant.  | ON October 11 , 1939 , two weeks after the Nazis had crushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man who was initiating him into the mysteries of the atom . The man who was explaining to the President the meaning of the fission of uranium and a selfperpetuating chain reaction was Russian-born , Columbiaeducated Alexander Sachs , of New York City , a consulting economist and a director of the Lehman Corporation , who , because of his gloomy views and predictions on Nazi power and world destiny in the prewar years , had been dubbed the " economic Jeremiah . " He had come to the President as the emissary of three exiled scientists , one of whom was Dr. Alert Einstein . They wanted the President to know that the Germans had started work on an atomic bomb , to be informed of the danger confronting us and the world and of the urgent need for starting such work in our own country . Through Sachs they offered their services to their adopted land . Sachs 's visit to the President had come as the result of discussions at Princeton , New Jersey , between Drs . Einstein , Szilard , and Wigner . In March @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that fast neutrons are liberated in the course of the splitting of uranium by slow neutrons . This , of course , opened  | the possibility of a chain reaction . Dr. Szilard had at once communicated his discovery , made independently at about the same time by Dr. Joliot in Paris , to Dr. Einstein , who in the meantime had already received disturbing news from Germany . They were soon joined in their discussions by Dr. Wigner . They decided there was no time to lose . Somehow they must manage to bring the matter to the attention of the President himself . It would be hopeless , they realized , to approach any lesser official . It is typical of the modesty of Dr. Einstein that he did not consider himself of sufficient importance to obtain an appointment at the White House . It so happened that Dr. Szilard shortly thereafter met Sachs , who had on occasion served the President as an informal adviser . In addition to being an economist , Sachs had also displayed a keen interest in scientific developments . He was just the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and later Dr. Teller , had been looking for . On that October clay at the White House Sachs was reading to the President a letter Dr. Einstein had prepared for that occasion on August 2 , 1939 . In it he had written to the President as follows : Some recent work by E. Fermi and L. Szilard , which has been communicated to me in manuscript , leads me to expect that the element uranium may be turned into a new and important source of energy in the immediate future . Certain aspects of the situation which has arisen seem to call for watchfulness and , if necessary , quick action on the part of the administration . I believe therefore that it is my duty to bring to your attention the following facts and recommendations . Here Dr. Einstein described in simple terms the phenomena of uranium fission and the chain reaction , and pointed out that the main sources of uranium supply were outside the United States , that the United States has only very poor ores of uranium in moderate quan- tities , and that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As to that , Dr. Einstein reported to the President as follows : I understand that Germany has actually stopped the sale of uranium from the Czechoslovakian mines which she has taken over . That she should have taken such early action might perhaps be understood on the ground that the son of the German Under Secretary of State , von Weizsaecker , is attached to the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Berlin , where some of the American work on uranium is now being repeated . Then Dr. Einstein told the President the main reason for his concern : In the course of the last four months it has been made probable through the work of Joliot in France , as well as Fermi and Szilard in America ? that it may become possible to set up a nuclear chain reaction in a large mass of uranium , by which vast amounts of power and large quantities of new radium-like elements would be generated . Now it appears this could be achieved in the immediate future . This new phenomenon would also lead to the construction of bombs , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a new type may thus be constructed . A single bomb of this type , carried by boat and exploded in a port , might very well destroy the whole port , together with some of the surrounding territory . However , such bombs might very well prove to be too heavy for transportation by air . This is the first mention of the atomic bomb on record . Dr. Einstein also enclosed the scientific report sent to him by Dr. Szilard , to which Sachs had attached a memorandum written by Dr. Szilard , explaining the contents and the meaning of the scientific paper in popular terms . After listening attentively to what Sachs had to say , and carefully examining the Einstein letter , the President said :  | " What you are after is to see that the Nazis do n't blow us up . " " Precisely , " Sachs replied . President Roosevelt called in Brigadier General Edwin M. Watson , Secretary to the President . " This requires action , " he said . This was the initial neutron that started a chain reaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hiroshima six years later . At the order of the President , General Watson formed a committee to look into the matter . It was known as the Advisory Committee on Uranium and was headed by Dr. Lyman J. Briggs , director of the National Bureau of Standards . Other members were Lieutenant Colonel Keith F. Adamson of the Army Ordnance Corps , and Commander , later Admiral , Gilbert C. Hoover , of the Navy Bureau of Ordnance . This committee held its first meeting ten days later . A number of scientists were invited to attend . Many of them expressed themselves as opposed to support of such a project by the Government . It was Saclhs 's task in those early days , he related afterward , to try to convince " these gentlemen of science and Government officials , including the Army and the Navv , to indulge . . . in a willing suspension of disbelief . ' " On November 1 , 1939 a report was submitted to the President , which contained the following : The energy released by the splitting of a mass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If the chain reaction could be controlled so as to proceed gradually , it might conceivably be used as a continuous source of power in submarines , thus avoiding the use of large storage batteries for underwater power . If the reaction turned out to be explosive in character it would provide a possible source of bombs with a destructiveness vastly greater than anything now known .  | The military and naval applications . . . must at present be regarded only as possibilities because it has not yet been demonstrated that a chain reaction in a mass of uranium is possible . Nevertheless , in view of the fundamental importance of these uranirim reactions and their potential military value , we believe that adequate support for a thorough investigation of the subject should be provided . We believe that this investigation is worthy of direct financial support by the Government . This was a step in advance over a previous adverse report , submitted by a technical adviser to one of the services following Dr. Fermi 's first approach to Army and Navy representatives in March of that year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommendations this time were more encouraging , " alas , we had no money . " In those days General Watson stood up against military and naval men who kept saying : " Well , this is still so remote ; what is this thing ? Let 's wait and see . " To which General Watson would reply : " But the boss wants it , boys . " Hardly any progress , however , was made in those early months . Mr. Sachs talked the matter over with Dr. Einstein , and on March 7 , 1940 , the scientist addressed a letter to him for presentation to President Roosevelt . Since the outbreak of the war , the Einstein letter read interest in uranium has intensified in Germany . I have now learned that research there is being carried out in great secrecy and that it has been extended to another of the Kaiser Wilhelm Insti , tutes , the Institute of Physics . The latter has been taken over by the Government , and a group of physicists , under the leadership of C. F. von Weizsaecker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Institute of Chemistry . The former director was sent away on a leave of absence apparently for the duration of the war . " He then went on : I have discussed with Professor Wigner and Dr. Szilard the situation in the light of the information that is available . . . .  | You will see that the line he Dr. Szilard has pursued is different and apparently more promising than the line pursued by M. Joliot in France ... . The first transfer of funds from the Army and Navy for the project that was later to cost two billion dollars was $6,000 . This gives an indication of the pace at which the work was proceeding during 1940 and the greater part of 1941 . Meantime in Great Britain things were moving at a much faster pace . " The potentialities of the project were so great , " Prime Minister Churchill stated , " that his Majesty 's Government thought it right that research should be carried on in spite of the many competing claims on our scientific manpower . " Accordingly , intensive work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , principally Oxford , Cambridge , London ( Imperial College ) , Liverpool , and Birmingham . Responsibility for co-ordinating the work and pressing it forward lay in the Ministry of Aircraft Production , advised by a committee of leading scientists presided over by Sir George Thomson . Later , on the recommendation of the Chiefs of Staff ( whose advice had been asked by Mr. Churchill ) , urging " immediate action and maximum priority , " a special division was set up within the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research , which , for purposes of secrecy , was called the Directorate of Tube Alloys . Work on uranium was also being pushed in France during 1939 and through the spring of 1940 under the direction of Dr. Joliot . At the fall of France , in June 1940 , Dr. Joliot sent two of his co-workers , Drs . Halban and Kowarski , to England . With them they brought 165 liters of heavy water ? practically the whole world stock of this material ? which the French Government had bought from the Norsk Hydro Company just before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out right under the Nazi nose in one of the most dramatic episodes of the war . It delayed German progress in their uranium research by months , as subsequent events showed . Heavy water , in which the hydrogen has twice the atomic weight of the hydrogen in ordinary water , is an even more efficient moderator than graphite for slowing down neutrons . Professor Joliot , who remained in France to play a major role in the underground , instructed Drs . Halban and Kowarski " to make every effort to get in England the necessary facilities to enable them to carry out , in co-operation with the British Government , and in the joint interest of the Allies , a crucial experiment which had been planned in Paris and for which the heavy water ' had been acquired . " Work was also carried on in Denmark by Professor Bohr until the Nazis invaded his country in April 1940 . He had a small supply of heavy water , which , to prevent its falling into the hands of the Nazis , he kept in a large beer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the British , he escaped from Denmark in a small boat four years later , he took the bottle with him , only to discover on his arrival in Sweden that in his haste he had taken along just an ordinary bottle of good Danish beer . The heavy water in the beer bottle was later rescued by the Danish underground . The first interchange ' information on uranium among Britain , the United States , and Canada , under a general arrangement then in force for pooling scientific knowledge , took place in October 1940 . On October 11 , 1941 President Roosevelt sent a letter to Prime Minister Churchill suggesting that " any extended efforts on this important matter might usefully be co-ordinated or even jointly conducted . " Accordingly , all British and Ameri- can efforts were joined , and a number of eminent British scientists proceeded to the United States . Such progress had been made by the British group that by the summer of 1941 Sir George Thomson 's committee was able to report that , in the view of its members , " there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced before the end of the war . " This news soon reached scientists in the United States . A first draft of the British scientists ' report was made available to Dr. Bush and Dr. Conant in the summer of 1941 . At the same time Dr. M. L. E. Oliphant , of radar fame , who was on a visit to this country , held several informal discussions with our scientists , and in particular with Dr. Lawrence . Oliphant told them of large-scale plans in Britain to push work on the subject to the limit . This visit of Dr. Oliphant , together with the British report and a report of a similar nature prepared by our own National Academy of Sciences , following discussions between Drs . Lawrence , Conant , and Compton , led to the famous decision on December 6 , 1941 , to go all out on atomic bomb investigations . By the middle of 1942 the progress was such that it appeared feasible to initiate plans for the construction of production plants . In the meantime President Roosevelt had appointed a General Policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consisted of Vice President Henry A. Wallace , Secretary of War Stimson , General George C. Marshall , Army Chief of Staff , Dr. Bush and Dr. Conant . By ' June 1942 this group recommended a great expansion and acceleration of the work . The construction phases of the work were assigned to the Corps of Engineers . On June 19 , 1942 Colonel J. C. Marshall was selected by the Chief of Engineers to form a new Engineer District and carry on the work assigned to it . Two days later Colonel ( now Brigadier General ) Kenneth D.  | Nichols , West Point Honor Graduate of the Class of 1929 , was selected as Colonel Marshall 's Deputy . On August 13 , 1943 , he succeeded Colonel Marshall as District Engineer , a post corresponding to that of president of a corporation . On August 16 , 1942 the Atomic Bomb Project was officially launched under the camouflaged designation : Manhattan Engineer District . Its first headquarters were located in lower Manhattan . By September 1942 it became evident that the project was of even greater magnitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But there was no turning back . At all times the project had the wholehearted backing of the President . On September 17 , 1942 , Secretary Stimson placed Major General ( at that time Brigadier General ) Groves , one of the ablest members of the Army Corps of Engineers , in complete charge of the Manhattan Engineer District . Five days later the President 's General Policy Group appointed a committee to plan military policy relating to the project , such planning to cover production , strategic and tactical problems , and research and development . General Groves was named to sit with this committee and act assts executive officer . Toward the end of 1942 the British proposed that an important section of the work should be carried on in ! Canada as a joint Anglo-Canadian enterprise . Accordingly a joint laboratory was established in Montreal at the beginning of 1943 , under the administration of the National Research Council . Practically the whole of the Cambridge group , under Dr. Halban , was moved to Montreal . During the spring of 1944 the Americans joined actively in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Its scope was enlarged and later in 1944 a site was selected on the Ottawa River ,  | near Petawawa , Ontario , for the construction of a pilotscale pile , using heavy water supplied by the United States Government as the slowing-down medium . To protect the Canadian uranium supply for the United Nations , the Canadian Government took over the ownership of the rich uranium mines and extraction plant near Great Bear Lake . A large part of the uranium for the atomic bomb plants came from this Canadian source . In August 1943 a combined **25;1593;TOOLONG policy committee had been formed to assume responsibility for the broad direction of the project as between countries . Interchange of information was provided for within certain limits . In the field of scientific research and development full interchange was maintained between those working in the same sections of the field . In matters of design , construction , and operation of large-scale plants information was exchanged only when it would serve to hasten the completion of weapons for use in the war . All these arrangements were subject to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the project were drawn from a general non-earmarked " expediting account " provided by Congress . The funds in this account , which Congress kept replenishing to maintain it at a level of $600,000,000 , were spent on certification by ' hider Secretary of War Robert P. Patterson , who signed and approved the Manhattan District contracts submitted to him by General Groves . Around September 1944 , when the total of these contracts was approaching the two-billion-dollar mark , the Under Secretary began to get worried . So he asked Michael J. Madigan , a New York consulting engineer and an expert on construction , who was then serving as his Special Assistant , to look things over . Mr. Madigan , a very practical engineer , went out and talked to various people and saw some of the vast plants  | that were growing up . He then came back and made his report . " Judge , " he said , " I have been all around and seen everything , and I am here to tell you that you have nothing to worry about at all ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they wo n't investigate anything . And if it does n't work " ? he repeated slowly : " And if it does n't work ? they wo n't investigate anything else . Alongside of this , " he added , " everything else that we have done will seem a sensible procedure . "  | WHEN , on the day before Pearl harbor , the momentous decision was reached to go all out on the effort to develop an atomic bomb , the gun was fired marking the last and decisive lap in the greatest race of all time , with the outcome very much in doubt . Since there were strong grounds for believing that the Nazi scientists were far in the lead , it was realized that the grim battle of the laboratories had to he fought on two fronts , in the laboratory and in the field . On the one front the battle was to be waged with the greatest array of scientific and engineering talent , equipped with vast material resources ; on the other , a specially trained corps would sabotage the Nazi atomic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both civilian and military , were trained in the United States and Britain . Their mission was to find out where the Nazi atomic bomb plants and laboratories were located . This information was used in the selection of pin-point targets for British and American bombers , or of demolition jobs for saboteurs . These were either members of the the underground in the particular locality or specialty troops landed by glider or dropped by parachute . When Norway was invaded in April 1940 , British scientists at once called to the attention of the authori- ties the need to keep a watchful eye on the Norsk Hydro Hydrogen Electrolysis plant in Vemork , in the Norwegian province of Telemark . That plant was at the time the largest producer of heavy water , the production of which is a singularly slow business . Since heavy water , as I have said , is the most efficient moderator for neutrons , and therefore the most efficient substance for the construction of a chain-reacting atomic pile , and since even at that early date the possibility of producing plutonium for atomic bombs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became evident that the possession of the only large heavy-water plant in the world would give the Nazis a tremendous advantage . As early as September 1939 , German scientists had publicly stated that the manufacture of heavy water might become vitally important to their , war effort . In May 1940 , after the fall of Norway , the British Ministry of Economic Warfare received the disturbing intelligence that Germany had ordered Norsk Hydro to increase heavy-water production to 3,000 pounds a year . In 1942 it was learned that Germany demanded a further increase to 10,000 pounds . This demand called for immediate action , as by that time British scientists were practically certain that , given sufficient heavy water and uranium , a chain-reacting pile could be made to operate . Since the Nazis had already placed an embargo on the export of uranium from Czechoslovakia , it became absolutely certain that they were building atomic piles . The matter was referred by the Ministry of Economic Warfare to Special Forces , the Allied organization entrusted at that time with the responsibility of co-ordinating resistance in the enemy-occupied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contacts in the area . It so happened that one of a party of Special Force  | Norwegians who , on March 17 , 1942 , had captured a Norwegian coastal steamer ( the S.S. Galtesund ) and brought it from Norway to Aberdeen , had considerable knowledge of the neighborhood of Vemork and had been in touch with some of the Norsk Hydro engineers . Einar , as he may be called , was given hurried training and precise instructions and was dropped back by parachute on Telemark on March 28 . To the end he remained a permanent feature of the heavy-water operations , one of the great epics of the war . A small follow-up party was formed to be dropped on Telemark the following month , but weather conditions prevented the carrying out of the operation for some time , and diminishing hours of darkness put an end to all night flights for that season . In July 1942 , after further disturbing intelligence , the ' War Cabinet Offices approached Combined Operations with a request that Vemork should be attacked . They urged that the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then asked Special Forces to provide a small advance party to act as local guides and collectors of intelligence for a sabotage attack against the heavy-water plant ? the attack to be carried out later by Combined Operations personnel , whom it was proposed to land by glider . " From the outset it was realized , " the offical British report points out , " that the operation was exceptionally dangerous . Of all countries , Norway is the least suitable for glider operations . Its landing-grounds are few ; its mountains thickly clustered , precipitous and angry . The broken countryside throws up air-pockets and atmospheric currents . ' Weather conditions in the autumn of 1942 were vile . " To add to the difficulties , the Norsk plant is located  | on top of a high cliff overlooking the beautiful valley of the Moon River , and was inaccessible from the front , which was heavily guarded by a Nazi garrison , and from the sides . The only possible approach was from the rear . This required landing on a high plateau , making a precipitous descent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cliff . The landing , of course , had to be made many miles away from the valley in an isolated section in the snow-covered mountains . Special Forces provided an advance party of two officers and two non-commissioned officers of the Royal Norwegian Army 's British-trained Linge Company , named after Captain Martin Linge , D.S.C. , a Norwegian soldier killed in action after the Commando landing at Maaloy on December 27 , 1941 . The party 's leader was named Jens . The others were Claus Heiberg , Kjell Nielsen , a chemical engineer who had worked at Norsk , a man whose name is given only as Arne , and Einar , who joined the party later and became its wireless operator . Two attempts to drop the group in September failed because of heavy clouds . The party , operating under the code name of Swallow , finally made a parachute landing on a mountainside east of Fjarefit in the Songadal , with equipment in containers and packages , at 11.30 p.m. on the night of October 15 , 1942 . It took them two days to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the food supply and equipment not immediately needed was hidden at a base depot , to which it was planned that Swallow should retreat when the operation had been carried out . The weather was fine during these days , with patches of snow scattered lightly over the mountainside . But on October 21 a tremendous snowstorm burst in great violence , and within a matter of hours Swallow saw the arrival of full  | winter and fair skiing weather . Swallow advanced to the operational area . The report of Swallow 's leader takes up the story : October 21 , 1942 Claus and I skied with full packs into Haugedal , where I knew there was a hut . We failed to find it before nightfall , and heard later that it had been moved . Heavy march back , in the dark and mist . The other two tried in vain to make radio contact with London . We had no paraffin for our Primus stoves and therefore had to ignore mountain routes where there was no wood to be found ; so I decided to advance through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huts in which we could spend the night . October 22 We set out on our heavy march . I hoped that our food , with the strictest rationing , would be sufficient for 30 days . We had been told to make no outside contacts except in the gravest emergency . At high altitudes and in bitter cold , no man can be expected to carry a load weighing more than 30 kilos 66 pounds . Our equipment consisted of eight such loads . This meant that , in our party of four , each man must make three journeys every day over the same stretch . The ground was bad and rugged , the snow heavy and deep . Men who left the ski-tracks sank up to their knees . It was mild weather , and clumps of snow stuck to the bottom of our skis . The little bit of ski-way that we had we wished to keep for the retreat . The lakes , marshes , and rivers were not properly covered with ice , and could only be walked on here and there . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soaked all the time . So our day 's marches were sorrowfully short . We often advanced only a few kilometers a day . On the very first day I broke a ski-pole . It was a month before I got a new one . October 24 We reached a deserted farmhouse at Barunuten , where we found meat and flour . We ate our fill for the first time since our arrival . We also found a ski-toboggan.  | October 30 We reached Reinar . Now we are getting near inhabited places . We were very tired . I had a throbbing boil on my left hand and had to have my arm in a sling . We had kept ourselves in good shape during the waiting period in England , but the hard toil on short rations had sapped our strength . A day 's ration consisted of a quarter-slab of pemmican , one handful of groats , one handful of flour , four biscuits , a little butter , cheese , sugar , and chocolate . Claus was sent back to the empty farmhouse at Barunuten to steal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leader went forward to reconnoiter the line of advance . The W/T operator stayed to make a further attempt to contact London . A rendezvous was arranged for November 3 . The leader continues : Claus traveled to Barunuten and back ? a distance of 50 miles ? under terrible going conditions . He proved the old saying : " A man who is a man goes on till he can do no more and then goes twice as far . " Arne and I did not do many kilometers . I fell through the ice while crossing a river . This was the second time . Next day we tried to cross another river , but found no ice and returned , tired out , to Reinar , where the wireless operator told us that , just at the moment when he had succeeded in making contact with London , his accumulator had run out . Our plans had to be altered . The fulfillment of our job depended on our being able to find a new accumulator . November 6 We reached our operational base at Sandvatn , completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The march had taken 15 days . Claus had procured an accumulator from the keeper of a local dam at 1blsvatn . The first thing we had to do was to get into wireless contact with England . We felt that they must be anxious about us . Antenna masts of a good size were put up . But we failed again ? this time because the W/T set was damp .  | November 9 ' We made contact with England at last . After this the wireless service went well . We prepared for the reception of the gliders . Officers at Special Force Headquarters , London , breathed a sigh of relief when Swallow came on the air ? even though the intelligence received lent to their relief a slight foreboding . The Germans , who had a strong garrison in the area , had set wire barricades around the factory and alongside the penstock lines that carried water down the mountainside to the factory 's dynamos . The glider parties stood by . " Mock-up " models of the machinery to be attacked , based on Swallow 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Selected air-borne troops were trained for the specific demolitions required . Swallow , working in constant difficulty at an altitude of four thousand feet in a temperature continually below zero , daily transmitted weather reports and further intelligence with accuracy and punctuality . On November 19 two aircraft , each towing air-borne troops in a glider , took oil front Scotland . One aircraft and both gliders crashed on t he southwest coast of Norway about one hundred miles front the target . Jens , the Swallow leader , continues : November 20 London 's radio message about the glider disaster was a hard blow . It was sad and bitter , especially as the weather in our part of the country improved during the following days . But we were happy to hear that another attempt would be made in the next moon period . This second attempt was mounted and manned by Special Force personnel only . Six volunteers from the  | Linge Company were selected to form the assault party and given intensive special training . The difficulties of attack had been multiplied . German interrogation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operational objective . The Rjukan garrison was again increased , the area combed for saboteurs , and many loyal and innocent Norwegians were arrested . The German Reichskommissar , Josef Terboven , and General von Falkenhorst inspected the Vemork defenses in person . Special Forces were fortunate in having the services of the late Major Leif Tronsted , formerly professor of industrial chemistry at Trondheim University . His knowledge of heavy water and of the Vemork plant was unique . ' Swallow waited patiently , continued their watch , and sent their signals , working in snow and ice , short of food , and with failing power in their W/T set . The leader says : December 18 To make matters worse everybody except myself became sick with fever and pains in the stomach . We were short of food and were obliged to begin eating reindeer moss . The W/T operator found a Krag rifle and some cartridges . I went out every day after reindeer , but the weather was bad and I could find none . Our supply of dry wood came to an end . December @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a hut . He came back the next day with fish preserved in earth . December 23 The weather cleared and at last I shot a reindeer . We celebrated a happy Christmas . The same patience had to be exercised , and even greater nervous strain suffered , by the party mobilized in England . Although their training had been completed  | and they were ready to leave , the weather prevented their departure . On the night of January 23 , 1943 they actually flew over Norway , but after crossing over Telemark for two hours , were forced to turn back , as mist obscured the dropping-point and the lights that Swallow had laid out ready for their reception . On February 10 , 1943 Swallow signaled the exact position of all sentries and guards at Vemork . At midnight on February 16 the six Norwegian soldiers from Special Forces , operating under the code name Gunnerside , dropped by parachute on the frozen surface of Lake Skryken , thirty miles northwest of Swallow . A radio message from London informed Swallow of Gunnerside 's arrival . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journey of thirty miles in the Norwegian winter can take as long as three hundred miles in warmer , flatter lands . The Gunnerside leader 's report takes up the story : February 16 , 1943 At midnight precisely my party of six landed safely on Norwegian soil . The poop was made from 1,000 feet . One package ( containing 4 rucksacks ) landed and was dragged by a windfilled parachute for some 2 Ions . 11.2 miles before coming to rest in an open ice-crack , from which it was salvaged . One sleeping-bag and two rucksacks were damaged . Otherwise all our gear landed safely . February 17 Our equipment was unpacked . Items required for the advance were repacked , and the remainder hidden to form a depot . The necessary stakes were placed as landmarks in the snow and their bearings taken . We finished our work at 4 a.m. , by which time driving snow had already hidden every trace of the landing and the digging . We slept at an uninhabited hunting-lodge . By 5 p.m. on the same day all was prepared for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind-driven snow and a moon . Our packs weighed 30 kgs. 66 pounds , and our two  | toboggans 50 kgs. 110 pounds each . After an hour 's heavy going , the drifting snow became so thick that it was impossible to find our way . I gave the order for a return to the huntinglodge , which we reached at 8 p.m . It was then very cold , with a full westerly snowstorm . February 18 A snowstorm of great violence burst upon us . It was impossible to go out of doors . All hands felt ill owing to change of climate . Two had bad colds . February 19 Clear skies ; but still the same storm , still the same driving snow . We made an attempt to reach the depot to fetch more food , but had to give up for fear of losing our way . During the night the chimney-pot blew off the hunting-lodge . February 20 Clear skies , less wind ; but still the driving snow . We made another attempt to fetch food , but the snowstorm had so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After three hours the attempt was abandoned . We made a final by the same afternoon and at length found one container . The position of the depot was re-marked . February 21 The snowstorm raged with renewed power . Visibility zero . All hands were filled with a great weariness and lassitude , and the two men who had been suffering from colds were now seriously ill . February " - 22 Today the storm blew itself , finally , to a standstill . The weather turned fine , and I gave the order to prepare for departure at noon . February 23 Nearing Kalltmg we were alarmed to see two bearded civilian skiers in apparently first-class physical condition . I ordered one of my men to put on his camouflage ski-smock and a civilian ski-cap . He set out to make contact with the strangers . If ques- tioned , he would say he was a reindeer-keeper on his rounds . The rest of us went into cover . For a little , there was silence among the Gunnerside party as its members waited and wondered what would be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near his holster . Then suddenly , above the noise of the wind , sounded what Joachim , the Gunnerside leader , described as " three wild yells of pleasure . " Gunnerside was in touch with Swallow . Swallow and Gunnerside reviewed the situation and jointly evolved an operational order , of which the following are extracts : Intelligence Fifteen Germans in the but-barracks between the machineroom and the electrolysis plant . Change of guard at 1800 , 2000 hours 6.00 p.m. , 8.00 p.m. , etc . Normally two Germans on the bridge . During an alarm : three patrols inside the factory area and floodlighting on the road between Vemork and Vaaer . Normally only two Norwegian guards inside the factory area at night , plus one at the main gates and one at the penstocks . All doors into the electrolysis factory locked except one that opens into the yard . The Plan From the advance position at the power-line cutting , the following will be brought up : arms , explosives , a little food . No camouflage suits to be worn over uniforms . Claus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the railway track . Advance to the position of attack some 500 meters 1 546 yards from the fence . The covering party , led by the second in command , to advance along the track , followed close behind by the demolition party , which the Gunnerside leader will lead himself . The position for attack will be occupied before midnight in order to be able to see when the relieved guards return to the barracks . According to information received from sketches and photographs , we have chosen the gate by a store-shed , some 10 meters 9 yards lower than the railway gates , as being best suited for  | the withdrawal and as providing best cover for the advance . The attack will start at 0030 hours 12.30 a.m . . Covering Party Duty : to cut an opening in the fence . To get into position so that any interference by German guards , in the event of an alarm , is totally suppressed . If all remains quiet , to stay in position until the explosion is heard or until other orders are received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party to use his own judgment if necessary . If the alarm is soinnded during the advance into the factory grounds , the covering party to attack the guard immediately . When the explosion is heard , it may be assumed that the demolition party is already outside the factory grounds , and the order is to be given for withdrawal ; the password is : " Piccadilly ? Leicester Square ! " Demolition Party Duty : to destroy the high-concentration plant in the cellar of the electrolysis factory . At the exact moment when the covering party either take up their position or go into action , the demolition party will advance to the cellar door . One man , armed with a tommy-gun , takes up a position covering the main entrance . Those carrying out the actual demolition are covered by one man with a tommy-gun and one man with a .45 pistol . An attempt will first be made to force the cellar door ; failing that , the door to the ground floor . As a last resort , the cable tunnel is to be used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached , the covering party will , if necessary , take over the placing of the explosives . If anything should happen to the leader , or anything upset the plans , all are to act on their own initiative in order to carry out the operation . Any workmen or guards found will be treated in a determined manner , as the situation may demand . If possible , no reserve charges will be left behind in the factory . It is forbidden for the members of either party to use torches or other lights during the advance or withdrawal . Arms are to be carried ready for use but are not to be loaded until necessary , so that no accidental shot raises the alarm . If any man is about to be taken prisoner , he undertakes to end his own life .  | The Gunnerside leader continues : February 27 The weather was overcast , mild with much wind . We left our advance base , a hut in Fj ? sbudalen , about 8 p.m . We started on skis , but were later forced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the telephone line it was very difficult , steep country ; and we sank in it up to our waists . At Vaaer Bridge we had to take cover , as two busses were coming up the road with the night shift from Rjukan . We followed the road to the powerline cutting . It was thawing hard now and the road was covered with ice . Skis and sacks were hidden close to the power-line cutting , from which we began a steep and slippery descent to the river at 10 p.m . On the river , the ice was about to break up . There was only one practicable snow-bridge , with three inches of water over it . From the river we clambered up slicer rock face for about 150 meters 164 yards to the Vemork railway line . We advanced to within about 500 meters 546 yards of the factory 's railway gate . Carried on a strong westerly wind came the faint humming note of the factory 's machinery . We had a fine view of the road and the factory itself . February 28 Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming up from the bridge . We ate some food we had in our pockets , and once more I checked up to make sure that every man was certain about his part in the operation and understood his orders . Cautiously we advanced to some store-sheds about 100 meters 109 yards from the gates . Isere one man was sent forward with a pair of armorer 's shears to open the gates , with the rest of the covering party in support . The demolition party stood by to follow up immediately . The factory gates , secured with a padlock and chain , were easily opened . Once inside , the covering party took up temporary positions while the demolition party opened a second gate 10 meters 11 yards below the first with another pair of shears . I stopped and listened . Everything was still quiet . The black- out of the factory was poor and there was a good light from the moon . At a given sign the covering party advanced toward the German guard-hut . At the same moment the demolition party moved toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoped to gain entry . The cellar door was locked . We were unable to force it , nor did we have any success with the door of the floor above . Through a window of the high-concentration plant , where our target lay , a man could be seen . During our search for the cable tunnel , which was our only remaining method of entry , we became separated from one another . Finally I found the opening and , followed by only one of my men , crept in over a maze of tangled pipes and leads . Through an opening under the tunnel 's ceiling we could see our target . Every minute was now valuable . As there was no sign of the other two demolition-party members , we two decided to carry out the demolition alone . We entered a room adjacent to the target , found the door into the high-concentration plant open , went in , and took the guard completely by surprise . We locked the double doors between the heavy-water storage tanks and the adjacent room , so that we could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guard , who seemed frightened but was otherwise quiet and obedient . I began to place the charges . This went quickly and easily . The models on which we had practiced in England were exact duplicates of the real plant . I had placed half the charges in position when there was a crash of broken glass behind me . I looked up . Some one had smashed the window opening on to the back yard . A man 's head stood framed in the broken glass . It was one of my two colleagues , who , having failed to find the cable tunnel , had decided to act on their own initiative . One climbed through the window , helped me place the remaining charges , and checked them twice while I coupled the fuses . We checked the entire charge once more , before ignition . There was still no sign of alarm from the yard . We lit both fuses . I ordered the captive Norwegian guard to run for safety to the floor above . We left the room . Twenty yards outside the cellar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the main entrance was recalled from his post . We passed through the gate and climbed up to the railway track .  | For a moment I looked back down the line and listened . Except for the faint hum of machinery that we had heard when we arrived , everything in the factory was quiet . It is calculated that 3,000 pounds of heavy water were destroyed , together with the most important parts of the high-concentration plant . Five of the Gunnerside party crossed the border into safety after a 250-mile journey on skis and in battle-dress , under conditions of almost unendurable hardship and in the vilest weather . They were flown back to England shortly afterward . The sixth of their number , Knut , remained behind in Norway for other work . The Swallow party also remained to report results , and then gradually dispersed , leaving only the original Einar , now an exceptionally efficient W/T operator , and Clans . From them London learned that General von Falkenhorst , Germany 's Supreme Military Commander in Norway , visited Vemork immediately after the disaster . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have ever seen . " Across the Special Force report on the activities of Gunnerside and Swallow , Prime Minister Churchill wrote : " What is being done for these brave men in the way of decorations ? " Eight Brit ish and nine Norwegian military decorations were awarded . Von Falkenhorst reacted energetically . The German guards were removed and punished . Once again the Gestapo combed Rjukan and once again arrested many innocent Norwegians . Mountain troops patrolled the area , some of whom fired nervously at one another . German reconnaissance aircraft hovered in the neighborhood , and one crashed . Mountain huts were broken into and burnt . Claus was the only one of the party who came into  | contact with the enemy , and his adventure is worth mentioning . On the high Hardangervidda PIateau he was suddenly confronted , on March 25 , 1943 , by three Germans , who appeared round a hill 100 meters 109 yards ahead , and started firing . He turned and went off on his skis , but after two hours found that one of the enemy would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a shortened form , in his own words : I therefore turned round , drew my pistol , and fired one shot from my Colt .32 . I saw to my joy that the German only had a Luger , and I realized that the man who emptied his magazine first would lose , so I did not fire any more , but stood there as a target at 50 meters ' 55 yards range . The German emptied his magazine at me , turned , and started back . I sent a bullet after him ; he began to stagger and finally stopped , hanging over his ski-poles . I turned back to get clear away , as the other two might come at any time . Half an hour later it was completely dark . After another two hours I went over a cliff , falling 40 meters 44 yards , damaging my right shoulder and breaking my right arm . The following day Claus encountered another large German patrol , but his plausible story deceived them and they detailed an escort to take him to a German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an ambulance to the Bardkeli Tourist Hostel , where he was given a room . But as night fell , Terboven , the Reichskommissar of Norway , and his staff arrived and demanded accommodation . Claus was left undisturbed , and Terboven occupied the next room to him . Claus had actually dropped his pistol in the snow before he encountered the second German patrol that morning . Next morning all the guests at the hostel , including Claus , were bundled into a bus and sent off to Grini Concentration Camp , as one of the women guests had refused to entertain Terboven during the night . Using a  | certain amount of guile and aided by the lady , Claus distracted the attention of the armed guard and managed to change his seat from the back of the bus to alongside the driver and the door . Toward dusk he seized his opportunity , flung open the door , and jumped out . Picking himself up , he staggered across a field toward a wood , followed by the explosion of two grenades thrown by the guard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bus . He escaped , and after other adventures succeeded in returning to Great Britian . The Final Clean-Up The directors of Norsk hydro tried to persuade the Germans to halve the manufacture of heavy water , but were overruled . In England the Combined Chiefs of Staff recommended a more powerful type of persuasion . Accordingly , on November 16 , 1943 , strong formations of the 8th U. S. Bomber Command attacked the Vemork power station and electrolysis plant . A further 120 pounds of heavy-water stock were lost . The directors of Norsk Ilydro restated their plea , and this time the Germans , a shade abjectly , granted it . On November 31 , 1943 Swallow ( the constant Dinar ) reported that all heavy-water installations at Vcmork were to be dismantled and sent to ( : crm:mv . On February 7 , 1944 he added that the transport of existing stocks to Germany would take place in about a week 's time . This information was passed to the War Cabinet Offices in London , who that same day issued top-priority instructions that everything possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By evening , approval had been obtained from the Norwegian Defense Minister in London to attack the stocks despite danger of local reprisals on innocent Norwegians . Immediate information to this effect was sent to Swallow , and to  | Knut , the one remaining member of Gunnerside , who was then fifty miles to the west . Knut was instructed to join up with Einar , and to ensure that the remaining stocks of heavy water did not reach Germany . At the same time a message was sent to another of the Special Forces parties in Vestfeld to proceed to Skien and prevent any special cargo from Rjukan being loaded at the port . On February 10 Knut was given permission to carry out a plan he proposed for sinking the Lake ' l'innsjo ferryboat Hydro , on which the remaining heavy-water containers would be loaded for the second stage of their long journey to Hamburg . A jubilant reply from Swallow contained a complete list of heavy-water stocks ready for shipment . The enemy was on his toes . Special S.S. troops were drafted into the Rjukan valley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new guards were stationed on the railway line from Vemork to the ferry quay ; but , by some freak of folly , not a single German guard had been posted on the Hydro herself . Knut , the demolition-party leader , says : At 1 a.m. on the morning of Sunday , February 20 , 1944 , I myself with three colleagues left Rjukan in a car that had been procured for the purpose . I went on board the Hydro with two men , while the third stood by the car on shore . Almost the entire ship 's crew was gathered below , around a long table ? playing poker , rather noisily . Only the engineer and the stoker were working . They were in the engine-room , so there was no question of going in there . We therefore went down to the passenger-cabin , but were discovered by a Norwegian guard . Thank God , he was a good Norwegian . We told him that we were on the run from the Gestapo , and he let us stay . Leaving one in the cabin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hole in the floor and crept along the keel up to the bows . I laid my charges in the bilge , hoping that the hole in  | the bows would lift the stern of the ferry and render it immediately unnavigable . I coupled the charges to two separate timedelay mechanisms tied to the stringers on each side . These timedelays I had had specially constructed out of alarm clocks . I reckoned that the charge was big enough to sink the ferry in about four or five minutes . I set the time-delay for 10.45 a.m. the same morning . This was the time ( as I discovered on a previous reconnaissance trip aboard the Hydro ) that would bring the ship to the best place for sinking . By 4 a.m. the job was finished , so we left . The car took us to Jondal , and we were in Oslo the same Sunday evening . A copy of the Quisling newspaper Frill Folk was in Einar 's hands early on Monday morning . Banner headlines announced the mysterious sinking of the ferrysteamer Hydro at approximately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard . The ship 's forepeak had filled with water . Propeller and rudder were lifted clear , and certain railway trucks had trundled forward the full length of the deck , to fall irretrievably into the deep waters of Lake Tinnsjii . Swallow came on the air later with a report to close the story . This said that 3,600 gallons of heavy-water stock had been sunk with the ship . Later the long-stop party at Skien complained bitterly that they were waiting , had marked down the ship that was to take the special cargo by sea to Ilan burg , had made their plans to destroy her , and had all their preparations ready , but no special cargo had coupe . " So it was , " the official report concludes , " that the manufacture of heavy water ceased in Norway ; and so it was that all stocks available to German scientists from that source were lost . " This was only one episode out of many in the epic " battle of the laboratories . " Others can not as yet be  | fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ striking example . So effective did the joint British-American counterintelligence become in the last year of the European war , and particularly after D-day , that the German scientists were forced to keep moving their laboratories from one place to another ; but they might as well have worked in a goldfish bowl . When we finally entered Germany we were so well informed that we even knew the street and number of the laboratory in any given city . Upon approaching a town , an advance party of our Positive Intelligence Group , headed by Major Francis J. Smith , would frequently get through the lines and head for the proper address , much to the amazement of the German scientists working there . On such occasions they would confiscate records and equipment , take the scientists back through the lines , and wait until the town was entered to complete the job . Major Horace K. Calvert , Oklahoma City lawyer , was head of operations in the European Theater of the Positive Intelligence Group , with headquarters in London . Around December 1944 his group turned over to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind us in the race for atomic energy . We were then absolutely certain that they did not have an atomic bomb . After V-E day our P.I . men , some of whom were physicists , interrogated the leading German scientists at length and obtained a complete picture of the German effort to create atomic energy . What they found was reported by one of them , Professor S. A. Goudsmit , of the University of Michigan , Dutch-born physicist , before the Senate Special Committee on Atomic Energy . Dr. Goudsmit was the scientific chief of the mission that was sent overseas to find out what German progress had  | been made on the atomic bomb . The progress made by German scientists toward the construction of an atomic bomb was " negligibly small , " Dr. Goudsmit found . He summarized the state of affairs in German nuclear research as follows : 1 . German scientists had abandoned hope of making a bomb for this war . 2 . They concentrated their efforts on production of atomic energy rather than an explosive . 3 . They had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaction . 4 . The total effort expended on the atomic-energy project was small , even though it had the highest priority . 5 . German scientists had no knowledge of our work . 6 . They believed that they were ahead of our developments in atomic energy . In Professor Goudsmit 's opinion , based on a careful study of German documents , there were six principal causes for " the complete German failure in this field " : 1 . German scientists lacked the vision that the Allied scientists possess . 2 . The Nazi Party and the German military placed incompetent scientists in key military positions . 3 . Lack of co-ordination caused competition instead of cooperation among the various groups . 4 . German scientists put into this field scarcely more effort than they would have into a peacetime research project , because they felt certain of their superiority . 5 . German pure science had no support from nor contact with the military . 6 . Allied bombing interfered with German progress . When President Truman revealed to the world that we had perfected an atomic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 ) r . Hahn , and Dr. ' Werner ( " Uncertainty Principle " ) Ileisenberg , were in Allied custody . When they heard the news , they flatly refused to believe it . " Propaganda ! " they scoffed .  | ' When doubt was no longer possible , the effect on them was so devastating that at least two , Dr. Hahn and another , attempted suicide . Dr. Ilahn gave as the reason for his act a keen sense of guilt , as the discoverer of uranium fission , for having unloosed this terrible weapon on the world . The other frankly admitted that he made his attempt out of chagrin and self-accusation for having failed the Vaterland . When their first shock was over , Professor Heisenberg , who headed one of the main divisions of the German atomic-energy project , rose and delivered a lecture to his colleagues on how the Americans made the atomic bomb . Allied scientists present on that occasion smiled . The Herr Professor was ' way off the mark .  | IT was not until the beginning of 1943 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plants for the mass production of U.235 and plutonium . As stated earlier , the amounts of these substances available at that time could barely be seen under the microscope . By the summer of 1945 they were being manufactured in amounts sufficient , in the words of President Truman , " to destroy Japan 's power to make war . " Those few who , like myself , had the privilege of visiting these plants , scattered over vast areas throughout the land , found it hard to believe the evidence of their senses . Even leading scientists , intimately connected with the project from the beginning , still found themselves in a state of wonderment . This was revealed to me in a conversation with President Conant several months before Hiroshima . " ' They wo n't believe you , " he said , " when the time conies that this can be told . It is more fantastic than Jules Verne . " " They 'll believe it if it works ! " I replied . During the course of my journey I discovered that in less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great industries , had built an Atomland-on-Mars , a scientific Never-Never Land , where the accepted " impossibles " of yesterday had become actualities of stag- gering dimensions , in both space and time . If a Rip Van Winkle had gone to sleep at the turn of the century and awakened to behold modern airplanes , radio , television , and radar , he could not have been more surprised than I was when I first visited the mammoth plants in which U.235 is being pried loose from U.238 , or the great atomic piles in which U.238 is being transmuted into plutonium . In the Spring of 1940 , as I have said , the highest yield of U.235 by the best apparatus then known was at the rate of one tenth of a millionth of a gram ( 0.1 microgram ) per day . At that rate it would have taken 10,000 , - 000,000 ( ten billion ) days ( 27,000,000 years ) to produce one kilogram . To concentrate a kilogram in one day , ten billion individual units of the apparatus would have been required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bomb has been stated to be between one and a hundred kilograms , and since President Truman has revealed that in August 1945 we were " prepared to obliterate every productive enterprise the Japanese have above ground in any city , " it is reasonable to assume that by the summer of 1945 we were producing U.235 in amounts measured by the kilogram . This is an increase in less than three years by a factor of many billions . The work of 27,000,000 years had been telescoped into a time scale measured in terms of minutes , hours , or days , as the case may be . The same was true with the atomic piles producing plutonium . The original chain-reacting pile at Chicago liberated atomic energy , through the fission of U.235 , at a maximum rate of 200 watts . Now , it is known that the fission of one kilogram of U.235 releases a total of 25,000,000 kilowatt-hours of energy , so that if one kilogram of U.235 were to be split per day , it would mean an energy release of 25,000,000 kilowatt-hours over a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power level of more than a 1,000,000 kilowatts . On the assumption that each atom of U.235 , when split , provides one neutron for converting one atom of U.238 into plutonium , so that each kilogram of U.235 split would yield one kilogram of plutonium ( which , of course , is not necessarily the case ) , then a production rate of one kilogram per day would call for the building of a pile that would operate at a steady level of a 1,000,000 kilowatts , or a power level 5,000,000 higher than the original Chicago pile . When the construction of plutonium-producing piles was planned in 1942 , even before the Chicago pile had been completed , it was estimated that to produce one kilogram of plutonium per day a chain-reacting pile would have to release energy ( through the fission of U.235 ) at 500,000 to 1,500,000 kilowatts , the rate , of course , depending on the number of free neutrons available for the conversion of U.238 into plutonium . The estimated power level was thus from 2,500,000 to 7,500 , - 000 times higher than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of comparison it may be pointed out that the ultimate capacity of the hydroelectric power plants at the Grand Coulee l ) am is expected to be 2,000,000 kilowatts , so that , at the higher rate , a pile producing one kilogram of plutonium a day would yield nearly as much energy as all the power plants operated by the world 's greatest ( lain . Since it was estimated that a single atomic bomb would require from one to one hundred kilograms of plutonium , it would have taken the Chicago pile from 7,000 to 700,000 years to produce a single bomb on the basis of the 500,000-kilowatt rate , while at the 1,500,000 rate it would have taken from 20,000 to 2,000,000 years . Evidently the Chicago pile , while it served its purpose  | of demonstrating the possibility of a self-perpetuating chain reaction , was not the answer for the production of plutonium in quantity . It was further evident that in order to produce plutonium in the proper amounts , in time for use in the war , it would be required to work out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chicago pile , which , of course , meant piles of radically different design . It was realized that such piles would have to be gigantic in dimensions and would cost hundreds of millions . Moreover , they would have to be built as a calculated risk , for no one could guarantee that , once built , they would actually operate as expected . The quantities of fissionable material estimated to be required for the job , which give us a clue to the ultimate goals aimed at by the top men of the project , are hinted at in the historic third report by the Committee of the National Academy of Sciences , submitted on November 6 , 1941 . " If the estimate is correct , " the report stated , " that 500,000 tons of TNT bombs would be required to devastate Germany 's military and industrial objectives , from one to ten tons of U.235 will be required to do the same job . " The report goes on to state that " if all possible effort is spent on the program , one might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significant quantity within three or four years . " From this it can be seen that those in charge of the program were aiming at a production rate high enough to provide from one to ten tons , or 1,000 to 10,000 kilograms , of U.235 in a reasonably short time , so that it could be used " to devastate Germany 's military and industrial objectives . " From the President 's statement we also know that by August 1945 we had enough to obliterate Japan as a military power . We can obtain a further estimate of the magnitude of this achievement by examining the time factors involved .  | Construction of the first large plant for separating U.235 began on February 2 , 1943 , and the first units were placed in operation on January 27 , 1944 . Construction of another giant plant for the same purpose , using a different process , began on September 10 , 1943 , and the first units began operating on February 20 , 1945 . Work on the first plutonium-production pile was begun on June 7 , 1943 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second and a third pile were in full operation by the summer of 1945 , producing plutonium on a scale described as " very large " ? large enough to produce atomic bombs of one to one hundred kilograms . In two and a half years ' time we had thus advanced from a rate of production that would have taken 27 , - 000,000 years for a kilogram of U.235 , and 7,000 to 20 , - 000 years for a kilogram of plutonium , to a rate at which enough was produced in the course of a few months to end the war in a matter of days , or , had we so chosen , minutes . As President Truman put it : We have spent two billion dollars on the greatest scientific gamble in history ? and won . But the greatest marvel is not the size of the enterprise , its secrecy , nor its cost , but the achievement of scientific brains in putting together infinitely complex pieces of knowledge held by many men in different fields of science into a workable plan . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design , and of labor to operate , the machines and methods to do things never done before so that the brain child of many minds came forth in physical shape and performed as it was supposed to do . Both science and industry worked under the direction of the United States Army , which achieved a unique success in managing so diverse a problem ir the advancement of knowledge in an amazingly short time . It is doubtful if such another combination could be got together in the world . What has been done is the greatest achievement of organized science in history . It was done under high pressure and without failure .  | The surprises that meet the visitor to the various plants are not confined to the plants as a whole , their enormous dimensions , their novelty in design , their Olympian grandeur , their unique processes , and their awesome products . Individual surprises relating to the multifarious components and apparatus in each of the plants await the visitor at every turn . He no sooner recovers from one than he is confronted by another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has reached the saturation point , he soon discovers that he has barely scratched the surface . For example , he enters one of the great buildings in which U.235 is being concentrated by the electromagnetic method . He no sooner passes through the door than he finds himself confronted by a monumental structure that practically fills the entire space of the building . Merely the appearance of this inner structure is impressive enough , but suddenly he learns the incredible fact that practically the entire monumental mass , occupying many tens of thousands of cubic feet , constitutes one gigantic electromagnet . Nothing approaching a magnet of this size was even considered possible before the war . As though that were not enough , the visitor soon learns that this is only one of many such magnets , scattered in various other similar buildings of this one plant , sprawling over an area covering five hundred acres . He then finds that these magnetic mastodons form but a part of a colossal isotope separation apparatus , descendant of a device known as a mass spectrometer , which , before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laboratory . The visitor then enters the main building of another plant , several miles away , where U.235 is concentrated by the gaseous diffusion method . He hears a roar from behind the massive walls and is informed that it is the  | sound of the molecules of a gaseous uranium compound racing through a barrier that separates the U.235 from the U.238 . The barrier , he learns , is an entirely new product that had never existed before . It contains myriads of holes , each no larger than two fifths of a millionth of an inch . Casually he is told that this barrier consists of nearly ten thousand miles of porous tubing , encased in more than a million cubic feet of equipment , practically none of which existed before the war . And then he finds out that the entire system of more than a million cubic feet is operating in a vacuum . While this is by far the greatest continuous vacuum on earth from the point of view of dimensions in space , the vast number of individual units of the electromagnetic plant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atmosphere " so ruffled that it is the nearest to nothingness ever attained . To find anything approaching it , one must take a journey into interstellar space . Naturally , to produce a vacuum of such dimensions requires powerful diffusion pumps in great numbers . Such high-vacuum diffusion pumps arc comparative newcomers to industry , and in 194 ( 1 new types were developed that were considered revohitionary . Compared with those at the plant in question , these 1940 high-vacuum diffusion pumps are crude , antiquated models . Not only are the pumps producing the vacuum vastly more powerful than any in operation in industry , but their number , compared with that in other industries , is astronomical . Since the plants operate in a vacuum behind heavy walls , unprecedented systems of automatic controls had to be devised . Here one comes upon the ultimate in technological wonders , gadgets upon gadgets , each performing a special job and recording its findings on a special control panel . There are the gadgets for detect- ing the slightest leak from or into the vast system . Other gadgets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gaseous uranium are , and tell the watchful operator exactly what is going on anywhere in the several million square feet of the plant at any given moment . Still others tell how the uranium isotopes are being separated at any one of the thousands of stages in the complex process . To examine the gaseous diffusion plant 's " brains , " the visitor would have to take a ten-mile walk to look at every control panel on just one floor . All this may help to clarify some of the confusion that has been plaguing the public mind as to whether or not there is an atomic bomb " secret , " and if so , whether the secret could be kept . The , answer is that there are not one , but hundreds , possibly thousands , of secrets , each of which will require engineering know-how of a high order to solve . The secrets begin right at the start in the production of pure uranium and graphite . Each of these may take a nation with less industrial know-how many years to work out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind their development the combined engineering skill and secret processes of all our great industries , passed down from generation to generation , with improvements all along the line , for more than a hundred and fifty years . These will not be easy to duplicate . We produced fissionable material by three different major methods . The number of secrets may be reduced if a nation decides to concentrate on only one ; but each single method involves scores of new processes , new technologies , and new devices , as well as great improvements in the employment and design of older methods and apparatus . This does not mean , of course , that we can keep these  | secrets indefinitely , nor that some simpler methods may not be developed in due time . Nor does the question of whether or not there is a secret have anything to do with the real issue of international control of atomic energy , for it is obvious to anyone that unless measures for such control are taken , we shall be sowing the seeds of a suicidal war with atomic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question about a secret . For even if we could keep the secret for centuries , some form of international control would still be essential for the good of ourselves and of mankind .  | THE two great plants for concentrating U.235 , covering a total of 1,100 acres , are part of a subdivision of the Manhattan Engineer District known as the Clinton Engineer Works , located on a 59,000-acre Government reservation eighteen miles to the northwest of Knoxville , Tennessee . In addition , the Clinton Engineer Works designed and built a plant for concentrating U.235 by the thermal diffusion method , which takes advantage of a difference in the rate of diffusion of light and heavy atoms in the presence of a gradiant in temperature ; an experimental plutonium pile that served as a pilot plant for the larger piles and for the study of the fission products of uranium ; a number of research laboratories ; and one of the world 's largest power plants . The three great atomic piles for producing plutonium , as well as three chemical plants at which the plutonium is separated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the Hanford Engineer Works . They are located on a huge Government reservation , comprising more than 400,000 acres , at an isolated semi-desert site fifteen miles to the northwest of Pasco , Washington . A third major site , at Los Alamos , New Mexico , twenty-five miles northwest of Santa Fe , served as the research and development center at which the products  | of Clinton and Hanford were shaped for their ultimate objective . Here , around a nucleus of a few buildings that had been used by the Los Alamos boys ' school , the greatest laboratory in the world , with a staff composed of scores of the world 's outstanding physicists , chemists , mathematicians , metallurgists , " weaponeers , " and leaders in other related fields , was organized by Dr. Oppenheimer . At this laboratory , to which our major universities contributed their fundamental research apparatus , the experimental work , as well as the design and construction of operable atomic bombs , was carried out . This included fundamental theoretical studies on the nature of the nucleus and the behavior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the fabrication of the auxiliary material that goes into the assembly of the bomb . In addition to the three principal sites operated directly by the Manhattan Engineer District , scores of new plants and expansions of existing plants , from New York to California , were erected to effect the rapid manufacture of specialized equipment , the refining of uranium and graphite , and the development and production of essential new materials . Besides the three great centers at Columbia , Chicago , and California universities , research was also carried on , under contract with the District , at twenty-seven other universities , four Government bureaus , and three research foundations . The total number engaged in the work , including those employed by contractors with the project , was considerably above 300,000 , of whom only a small number were aware of the nature and purpose of what they were doing . Since for reasons of security and safety the plants had to be located at isolated , sparsely settled sections of the country , the plans had to include living accommodations for the large number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the building , in a matter of months , of four hidden cities , each as secret in its way as Shangri-La . The largest of these , officially named Oak Ridge , but known as Dogpatch , or just the Patch , to its inhabitants , is located on the Clinton ' Works reservation . In less than two years it became the fifth largest city in Tennessee , with a total population of 79,000 . The second largest was Hanford , on the banks of the Columbia River in the state of Washington . Built as a construction camp for the Hanford plants , it grew in the course of one year to a city of 60,000 inhabitants , the fourth largest in the state , and dwindled down to zero in another year , as the construction job was finished . Several miles down the river was built the city of Richland , inhabited by the operating personnel of the Ilanford plants and their families , with a population of 17,000 in the summer of 1945 . A small Government-owned and operated community , with a population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It included so many world-famous scientists that it no doubt had the highest average I.Q. of any city in the world . Oak Ridge was the administrative center of the atomic project , as well as the residential section of the Clinton Engineer Works . In many respects it was unique in history . There have been other hidden cities , but never one of its size that grew so swiftly . What was probably most remarkable about it was the fact that the inhabitants themselves , with the exception of a few key men , knew nothing about the city 's purpose or what its giant plants were producing . The work was so compartmentalized that each worker knew only his own job and had not the slightest inkling of how his part fitted into the whole . Only certain top-ranking scientists , engineers , and  | Army officers had inside knowledge of the project , but even among them there were limitations . The head of one plant , for example , was kept completely insulated from other plants where different processes were used . On my return from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permitted to tell even Colonel Nichols what I had seen . Not only did the workers not know what they were producing in the mammoth plants , which consume tremendous amounts of electrical energy ; the vast majority of them could not even be sure they were actually producing anything . Since there are only fourteen pounds of U.235 per ton of uranium metal , and of course much less proportionately per ton of uranium compound , they saw huge quantities of raw material coming into the plant , but hardly anything coming out . This created an atmosphere of unreality , in which giant plants operated day and night to produce nothing that anybody ever saw , for the products were shipped in small amounts by special couriers with the greatest secrecy . The secrecy frequently led to tragicomic situations . A trusted courier was dispatched by automobile to deliver a small box of material , the nature of which he was not told , to a certain locality several hundred miles away . He was cautioned that at the first sign of any unusual behavior inside the box he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as far away from it as his legs would carry him . Our courier asked no questions and went his way , taking frequent glances at the strange box behind him . Things went well until he came to the middle of a long bridge . Suddenly , from directly behind him , came a terrific boom . Out of the car he dashed like one possessed , running faster than he had ever run in his life . Out of breath and exhausted , he stopped to examine  | himself to make sure that he was still in one piece . Meantime a long line of traffic had gathered behind his driverless car and the air was filled with the loud tooting of impatient motorists . Slowly he made his way back to his automobile and found to his amazement that it was still all there . Peering cautiously inside , he was even more amazed to find his precious box on the same spot as before . He was used to strange things , this courier , so he took his place at the wheel and was about to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loud boom directly behind him . Once again he made a dash for his life , heedless of the angry horns that by this time were sounding from a line more than a mile long . Still exhausted from his previous mad dash , he nevertheless managed to put a considerable distance between himself and his mysterious box . Eventually he made his way back , to find his car and his box in the same spot where he had left them . This time , however , he found an irate traffic officer waiting for him . Beyond showing the officer by his credentials that he was a Government employee , there was nothing he could tell him . It turned out that there had been blasting going on underneath the bridge . The average worker at Oak Ridge and elsewhere , when asked by some newcomer what he was making , might reply : " I 'm making a dollar thirty-five an hour . " Many believed that the whole thing was actually one gigantic boondoggle . Some were convinced they were engaged in the manufacture of a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approaching the ribald , about the nature of the product . The stock jest among anti-New Dealers was that they were making " front ends of horses to be shipped to Washington for assembly . " There were  | a number who believed they were manufacturing a chemical to convert blacks into whites , the whole thing being a pet scheme of Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt . There is the story of the high-ranking Army officer who had been wined and dined regally by the Chamber of Commerce of a near-by community . After the customary after-dinner eulogies by the leading citizens , the officer , an engineer not much given to oratory , rose and made his acknowledgments to his hosts . This over with , he said : " And now , gentlemen , in token of my deep appreciation for your very kind hospitality , as a sign of the confidence and respect I have for you , I have asked and been granted permission to tell you what we are making in these plants which have meant so much to your community . I am now going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest secret of all time . " He paused and waited for the suspense to heighten . " We are making , " he said , and paused again , " wheels for miscarriages . " Life in the secret cities was a study in contrasts . As R. L. Dnffus stated in the New York Times , " the centuries jostle each other . " Only a few years back , the people at Oak Ridge , and at near-by happy Valley , most of whom come front stock that has lived long in these Tennessee hills , were existing on their worn-out land under conditions not very diticrcnt from those of centuries gone by . " Now , by a stupendous leap , " to quote Mr. Duffus , " they have been projected into the twentyfirst century . On one side of a certain highway there are tall stacks to dissipate the radioactive fumes from atomsplitting . On the other side is a plain log cabin , chinked with clay and whitewashed ? and lived in less than three years ago . " The story of Dogpatch would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economist , the public health authority , the criminologist , and many  | others . It has a medical insurance plan , on a voluntary basis , that pays for itself after a subsidy for the first six months . It has a high health standard and a low crime record , with hardly any crimes of violence . Its population , with the exception of Richland and Los Alamos , is the youngest in the country and has a very high birth rate , believed to be among the highest in the United States . At one time it had seventeen different religious bodies , all worshipping , at different times , at one little colonial-style church on top of a hill . With the bulldozers , carpenters , plumbers , and electricians also came books , musical instruments , artists ' paints and brushes , and all other paraphernalia of American culture , reflecting every section of the country and all strata of American life , for Dogpatch , as well as Richland and Los Alamos , were extremely cosmopolitan communities , their residents coming from virtually every state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also included a number of American Indians and Spanish Americans , descendants of the early Spanish settlers in New Mexico . Simultaneously with the construction of roads and streets , sewers and waterworks went the building of schools , theaters , a library , a hospital , a dental clinic , recreation centers , baseball diamonds , tennis courts , and other facilities . Cultural activities began almost as soon as the first residents moved into their homes . Industrialists and labor leaders could profit by a careful study of the labor relations in the District . There were no strikes , no jurisdictional disputes , no sit-downs . Members of AFL and CIO unions worked together side by side ; union men and non-union men performed their various tasks in harmony . By a special arrangement with the chiefs of the AFL and CIO and the heads of the unions all grievances were submitted to arbitration  | through a scheme worked out by the Army authorities . The labor leaders further agreed to refrain from sending organizers to the sites . While the Army was the final authority , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete local autonomy to run their affairs . There were many playgrounds , and the shouting and laughter of happy youngsters could be heard everywhere . The homes were pleasant and comfortable , the atmosphere in many of them reminiscent of that in a college town . There was one strict rule : no mention was ever made of the work going on in the plants , and , as far as one could determine , the women did not have the slightest inkling of what their menfolk were doing . When Colonel Nichols invited me to his home for dinner , he reminded me not to mention anything I had seen , as Mrs. Nichols had no knowledge of the nature of the project . Oak Ridge , Richland , and 1 , os Alamos were communities of green lawns and flowers . Men and women , most of them from cities , puttered around in their gardens , planting flowers , mowing lawns , discussing seeds with their neighbors , showing great pride in their newly learned horticultural skills . It ( lid not take long for city and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for things that grow out of it after one has planted them with one 's own hands . The student of human values may be interested in the following episode . There were more than five thousand trailers in Oak Ridge , probably the greatest trailer camp in the world . Great care was taken to make their occupants happy and comfortable , yet there was noticed a feeling of social isolation , as though they were living on the wrong side of the railroad tracks . It was soon discovered that their principal complaint was a sense of  | loss of identity , which was remedied by providing the camp with street names and an individual number for each trailer . Until they had an address they had considered themselves gypsies . A street and number gave them a sense of belonging . It apparently is not enough to have a roof over one 's head . A roof is not home until it has an address . The problem of carrying the workers to and from plants scattered over an area of more than ninety square miles presented a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself at the Office of Defense Transportation and asked the official in charge for five hundred busses . The official was aghast . " Five hundred busses ! " he repeated . " Impossible . Preposterous . What could you need that many busses for ? " " We have a big war project , " said Colonel Nichols . " No project can be big enough to need five hundred busses , " the official replied . But he soon got word from higher up to provide the busses as quickly as possible and not ask any questions . As it turned out , the 500 busses filled only 66 per cent of the need . By the middle of 1944 there were 350 busses operating on the area , while an additional 500 carried non-resident workers to and from their homes . From July 1944 to June 1945 the on-area busses alone carried 22,252,479 passengers . During June 1945 they carried 2,401,070 . The Clinton Engineer Works is bounded on the cast , south , and west by the tortuously winding Clinch River for a total distance of thirty-six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , running east and west . The northernmost is Black Oak Ridge , from which the town took its name . Next in order come East Fork  | Ridge , Pine Ridge , Chestnut Ridge , and Haw Ridge , all wooded with oak and several species of pine . The variety of vegetation in this region is said to be wider than anywhere else in the United States , the area constituting a meeting ground between Northern and Southern varieties of flora . The reservation is not far from the Great Smoky Mountain area , which lies east and southeast of Knoxville . To the west are the Cumberland Mountains . The largest towns in the area , besides Knoxville , are Clinton , from which the works derives its name , Harriman , and Lenoir City . The project covers part of two counties , Anderson and Roane , the greater part being in Anderson . It lies in the heart of the TVA country and is situated about twenty miles from Norris Dam , which provided one of the principal reasons for the selection of the site , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coast , and isolation . The town of Oak Ridge is in the northeastern part of the reservation , about eight miles from Clinton . One production plant is situated between Pine and Chestnut ridges . Another large plant is at the extreme western part of the reservation , fifteen miles from Oak Ridge proper . The experimental pile is at the southwestern part of the area between Chestnut and I law ridges . Another process plant is in the area of a huge steam plant . The total amount of lumber used by the Clinton Engineer Works from the latter part of 1942 to May 1945 was in excess of 200,000,000 board feet , almost the output of the state of Minnesota for an entire year . Around 400,000 cubic yards of concrete were used for foundations and some of the structural frames in the plant areas , or one eighth the amount of concrete used in Boulder Dam . Around 55,000 carloads of material and equipment were shipped to the Clinton Works from  | November 1942 through June 1945 , and these were only a fraction of the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the early summer of 1945 , " I did n't know what a billion dollars could buy . " At the time the Manhattan District took over , there were about 3,750 residents on the land that was taken into the reservation . They were scattered over the entire 59,000 acres , which included the hamlets of Robertsville , Wheat , Scarboro , Happy Valley , and a large number of small farms on a total of over 800 separate tracts of land . The area was among the first in Tennessee to be settled , and great pains were taken to resettle the uprooted families . Many of them took jobs on the site . Old-timers on the reservation recollected a long-forgotten old man , dead for about fifty years , who had lived in the vicinity and whom the natives had regarded as a bit " touched . " There are some who still remember that old man telling all who would listen of the visions that had come to him of a great city rising on their land , and great smokestacks of huge plants belching smoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's long-forgotten prophecy helped to persuade many of the natives to part willingly with ancient homesteads . In this great American saga many a drama was enacted on the scene , in Tennessee as well as in Washington , when families refused to give up their old homes , even though they had been offered sums that to them must have seemed fabulous . They had lived on the land for generations , and though it was very poor land , which gave them only a meager livelihood for their toil , it was the land of their fathers and they did not want to part with it at any price . Army officers in charge were loath to move them , but in many instances they had no choice . " We had to move burning fires from their fireplaces , "  | Colonel Franklin T. Matthias told me in reminiscing about the early construction days at the Hanford Works . " Those fires had been burning for a hundred and twenty years , and they had to be carried out bodily . " The ancient fires from molecules had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | THE end of 1942 was marked by four outstanding developments in the Atomic Bomb Project . One of these , of course , was the spectacular production of the first selfsustaining chain reaction , which led directly to the second ? the authorization to proceed with the construction of the plutonium plants at Hanford . At the same time it was decided to experiment with several different methods and thus lessen the possibility of ending up in a blind alley . Accordingly , orders were issued to proceed with the construction in Tennessee of the electromagnetic and gaseous diffusion plants for concentrating U.235 . The electromagnetic method is based on the principle that electrically charged atoms , named ions , describe a curved path as they move through a magnetic field . Atoms of different mass and the same electric charge , when moving with the same speed through the magnetic field , follow different circles , and the path of the heavier atoms , because of their greater momentum , has a longer radius than the path of the lighter atoms . The atoms are most separated after traversing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be collected in specially designed containers . The gaseous diffusion method is based on the principle  | that at any given temperature the molecules of a lighter gas move faster than the molecules of a heavier gas . The apparatus developed for the electromagnetic separation of U.235 is known as the calutron , a name representing a contraction of California University 's cyclotron . It is a gigantic offspring of the prewar mass spectrometer , the laboratory apparatus used mainly for determining the relative abundance of the isotopes of the elements , as well as for detecting the existence of isotopes . But while basically the calutron is designed on the principle of the mass spectrometer , the two are about as far apart as a modern transport airliner is from the Wright brothers ' first airplane . The calutron consists of four principal parts : a source for the production and acceleration of uranium ions ( that is , uranium atoms stripped of an electron and thus carrying a positive charge of electricity ) ; a large magnet to make the ions follow a curved path of different radii @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a tube , chamber , or tank , pumped down to low pressure , ii- which the ions travel their different semicircular paths from the source to the collector . The tank is placed between the pole faces of the magnet . Solid or liquid compounds containing the atoms to be separated must first he vaporized . The ions are produced in the source by an electric arc running through the vapor . They are then accelerated by a high-voltage system and made to travel at constant speed along curved paths in the magnetic field . Upon arrival at the collectors the ions are neutralized ; that is , they give up their electric charge , and solid material is deposited . A high vacuum must be maintained in the tank in which the ions travel , to reduce the number of gas molecules present , as these would collide with the ions and  | deflect them from their path , resulting in contamination and the collection of less U.235 . Credit for this remarkable transmutation of a laboratory instrument into a giant industrial plant , which in the course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times , is mainly due to Professor Lawrence . The electromagnetic method had been ruled out on the basis of three principal limitations that were believed to be inseparable from the process itself and therefore impossible to overcome . These limitations , it was universally believed , would make it impossible to obtain U.235 in appreciable quantities . Attention was therefore focused on other methods . Dr. Lawrence had at his disposal the largest magnets in the world , incorporated in his giant cyclotrons , and he is the sort of man to whom the word " impossible " constitutes a challenge . So in November 1941 , without any financial assistance from any Government agency , he proceeded to rip his original cyclotron apart and put its 85-ton magnet to use in a giant mass spectrometer , alongside of which all existing apparatus of its kind were mere toys . Within three months he had produced an amount of U.235 thousands of times greater than had ever been concentrated before , at a ten times faster rate . This quantity was sufficient to be useful in determining the properties of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separation held possibilities of ultimate success . During the course of this preliminary work the Research Corporation made a grant of $5,000 to the University of California Radiation Laboratory , directed by Dr. Lawrence . In December 1941 the National Defense Research Committee , headed by President Conant , offered a Government contract to underwrite this phase  | of the research , and the grant from Research Corporation was returned . After the preparation of the first sample , experiments were pushed day and night to increase the output of the equipment . By March 1942 , alterations had raised the production rate for short periods by a factor of 500 . By May 26 , 1942 , the great 184-inch magnet , largest in the world , was turned on for the first time on the concentration of U.235 . Its completion as the world 's largest cyclotron had been indefinitely postponed some months previously in favor of its conversion into a giant mass spectrometer , the greatest by far ever built . The Rockefeller Foundation made a grant of $60,000 for the conversion , as a contribution to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by midsummer of 1942 , that the electromagnetic method was practical , and that a large enough electromagnetic plant could have a critical bearing on the war and inestimable implications for the future . By the fall of 1942 , plans for a small pilot plant to be built at Berkeley , California , were approved . It soon became evident , however , that time would not permit this conventional intermediary development between laboratory and product ion plant . Plans for the pilot plant were therefore abandoned and all efforts reoriented toward the single purpose of building a large industrial plant and putting it in operation in the shortest possible time . Since the plant was to require a tremendous amount if electric power , it was decided to locate it in the Tennessee Valley . Stone &; Webster was selected to design and build it . General Electric , Westinghouse , and AllisChalmers were the major suppliers of equipment . The Tennessee Eastman Corporation was picked to operate the plant . These companies established offices at the  | University of California Radiation Laboratory early in 1943 . Their scientists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's physicists , chemists , engineers , and shop technicians to translate data , procedures , techniques , and equipment into a practical functioning plant design . Tests of the mechanical and electrical equipment for the plant 's installations were carried on at the Radiation Laboratory simultaneously with the construction of the plant buildings . ' I lie results of these tests suggested many modifications of equipment to give smoother plant operation and increased output . Building the plant involved problems of construction and design never encountered before , since it is the first and only one of its kind in the world , and there was no time even to construct a small plant that could serve as a model . It has 270 buildings of a permanent nature . Its peak operating personnel totaled 24,000 . Since the electrified atoms to be separated must travel in a very high vacuum , high-speed vacuum pumps such as never existed before had to be created . After much research , Distillation Products Company developed pumps that produce and maintain extremely low atmospheric pressures . No vacuum pumps operating at such high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time in any other process . Great difficulties also had to be overcome in designing extremely delicate control equipment for high-voltage current . Rectifier units had to be designed capable of supplying a certain amperage at a very high voltage . These requirements are far above those encountered in radio broadcasting and similar high-voltage power applications . In the process for separating the uranium atoms the requirements limit to approximately 0.04 per cent of the mean voltage the maximum permissible variation in  | the value of high voltage supplied to the apparatus . Such precise regulation of high amounts of power at high voltages , to a load that intermittently acts as a short circuit , had never before been attained . Because of the great scarcity of copper , and because time was more precious than gold , 27,680,000 pounds of silver , worth $400,000,000 , were borrowed from the Treasury Department for use as winding coils and busbars for the multitudinous magnets . The solid-silver winding coils have a total length of more than 900 miles . Silver is as good a conductor of electricity as copper and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be returned to the Treasury when conditions warrant . Meantime this great plant for producing the material for the atomic bomb is , among other things , also a branch office of the Treasury . All the research involving the electromagnetic method for concentrating U.235 was carried out under Government contract at the University of California under the direction of Professor Lawrence . At the peak of the research , in August 1943 , 1 ) r . Lawrence was assisted by a staff of 1,266 , including 46S laboratory and research workers , and 365 employed iu plant operation . The gaseous diffusion plant for separating U.235 is shaped in the form of a U and covers an area of several million square feet . The met hod is based on the principle governing the diffusion of gases known as Graham 's law , as elaborated on by Lord Rayleigh in 1896 . According to Graham 's law , the rates of diffusion of different gases through a porous medium are , under similar conditions , inversely proportional to the square roots of the molecular weights of the gases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a molecular weight of 9 , and another gas , B , has a molecular weight of 16 , the rate of diffusion of gas A through a porous medium , as compared with  | the rate of diffusion of gas B , will be in the ratio of 4 volumes of gas A ( the lighter gas ) to 3 volumes of gas B. When a mixture of gas A and gas B is allowed to diffuse through a suitable porous medium , under ideal conditions , the ratio of gas A to gas B , in the portion first passing through the medium , will thus be 1.33 times greater than the original ratio of A to B. By subjecting the portion first diffused to the same process , a gas mixture in which the ratio of A to B is increased by a second factor of 1.33 can be obtained . In fact , the process can be repeated at will , finally achieving any desired ratio of A to B. In a practical plant , however , the separation factor in this particular example will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as high as 1.2 . As an example of such a plant , let us assume that the ratio of gas A to gas B is 1 to 50 , and we want to change it to 1,000 to 1 . Assuming that we obtain an increase in ratio of 1.2 of A to B at each stage , we would require a plant in which the diffusion process is repeated sixty times . When our scientists and engineers first considered the possibility of separating U.235 from U.238 by the gaseous diffusion method , they were confronted with a host of obstacles that at first seemed insurmountable . Applying our example to the case of uranium will illustrate the magnitude of the separation problem . Since uranium itself is not a gas , some gaseous compound of uranium had to be used . The only uranium compound at that time known that could be converted into a suitable stable gas was uranium hexafluoride , a combination of one atom of uranium and six atoms of fluorine , which would corrode practically anything with which it comes in contact . And not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually a solid at room temperature and atmospheric pressure . For these reasons a study of other gase- ous compounds of uranium was urgently undertaken . As insurance against failure in this search for alternative gases , it was necessary to continue work on uranium hexafluoride , particularly on divising methods for producing and circulating this gas . It was realized from the beginning that a plant for the concentration of U.235 by the gaseous diffusion method had to be of enormous dimensions , regardless of whether uranium hexafluoride or some other type of uranium gas was used . This can be illustrated by taking uranium hexafluoride as an example , though it would apply to other uranium gases as well . The molecular weight of uranium 238 hexafluoride is 352 , whereas the uranium-fluorine gas containing six atoms of fluorine and one atom of uranium 235 has a molecular weight of 349 . Since , according to Graham 's law , the rate of diffusion of the gas containing U.235 , as compared with the gas containing U.238 , would be inversely proportional to the square roots of their molecular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ square root of 352 ( 18.76 ) to the square root of 349 ( 18.68 ) ? the increase of the concentration of the U.235 hexafluoride would be by a factor of only 1.0043 . Under actual operating conditions this value is even smaller . This is , indeed , a very small enrichment factor . Hence , to bring it up to the desired level , it became necessary to design and construct a gigantic cascade in which the gas to be separated is made to pass through thousands of successive stages , each stage enriching the proportion of the U.235 gas over the preceding stage , the enriched mixture passing on to the next stage , where it is further enriched . No such plant for separation of gases had ever been designed or even conceived . One of the principal problems that had to be solved before the plant could be built involved the development  | of a suitable porous medium , or barrier , through which the uranium-gas mixture had to be diffused in a manner to allow a greater proportion of U.235 to pass through than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the barrier through which a gas mixture is diffused must be considerably smaller than the average distance a gas molecule travels before it collides with another gas molecule , a distance known as the " mean free path . " At atmospheric pressure the mean free path of a molecule is of the order of a ten-thousandth of a millimeter , or a tenth of a micron . To ensure true diffusive flow of the gas , the diameter of the myriad holes in the barrier must be less than one tenth of the mean free path ? that is , about one hundredth of a micron , or about four ten-millionths of an inch . Such a barrier must have billions of holes of this size or smaller . Furthermore , these holes must not enlarge or plug up as the result of direct corrosion or dust coming from corrosion elsewhere in the system . The barrier must be able to withstand the pressure " head " of one atmosphere . It also had to be of a type that could be manufactured in large quantities and with uniform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pumps would be needed and thousands of kilowatts to operate them . Also , that the whole circulating system would have to be made vacuum-tight and leakproof , requirements presenting problems of a magnitude never faced before . A new industry had to be developed to manufacture the porous barrier . To satisfy the demands for power , a huge powerhouse was constructed , the largest initial single installation of its kind ever built . The scientific research work on the diffusion process was initiated by Professor Dunning , and was carried on  | in a large building in upper Manhattan , under a contract between Columbia University and the Office of Scientific Research and Development ( OSRD ) , until May 1 , 1943 , when the work was taken over by the Manhattan Engineer District . In 1942 the M. W. Kellogg Company was chosen to plan the large-scale plant . For these purposes that company created a special subsidiary , the Kellex Corporation , and placed P. C. Keith in charge of it . The Kellex Corporation not only planned and procured materials for the large-scale plant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City laboratories and with the Columbia group . The plant was constructed by the J. A. Jones Construction Company , of Charlotte , North Carolina . In January 1943 Carbide and Carbon Chemicals Corporation was selected as the operator of the plant . Its engineers soon began to play a large role not only in the planning and construction but also in the research work .  | THE story of the creation , production , and purification of plutonium must rank as one of the greatest of modern times . In the histories of the future it will mark the beginning of a new chapter in the life of man . In this achievement he has gone far beyond the dream of the alchemists . Not only has he succeeded in transmuting a base metal into one much more precious than gold ; he has created an entirely new element not known to exist under the sun or anywhere else in the cosmos . Plutonium , element 94 , is the child of neptunium , element 93 , another man-made element . It is the grandchild of a new isotope of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus in creating plutonium man took three steps beyond nature . The process of this elemental creation starts in the atomic pile , in which U.238 is mated with U.235 . As often happens in the act of propagation of species , the male element , U.235 , is destroyed in the consummation of this marriage of the elements . By its very act of death the U.235 liberates the fertilizing agent , the neutron , which penetrates the U.238 nucleus . When this happens , the U.238 also goes out of existence , and a new isotope of uranium is born , containing 147 , instead of 146 , neutrons.  | This new isotope has a rather turbulent existence . The nucleus is top-heavy and begins making frantic efforts to restore the balance between protons and neutrons . Soon a negative electron ( beta particle ) comes flying out . This negative electric particle is lost by one of the 147 neutrons in the U.239 nucleus . That neutron is thus left with its positive charge deneutralized ; that is , it has been converted into a proton . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 146 neutrons ; but instead of 92 protons , it now has 93 . This means that a new element , element 93 , has been created out of element 92 . Since uranium was named after the planet Uranus , the element beyond uranium was named neptunium , after the planet Neptune . But the volcanic eruptions started by the neutron do not end here . Neptunium also has a turbulent life . In a short time the process repeats itself . One of its 146 neutrons radiates away a negative particle and becomes transmuted into a proton . This means that the nucleus now has 94 protons and 145 neutrons . It still has a mass of 239 , but it is now an entirely new clement , beyond uranium as well as beyond neptunium , a ninety-fourth building block in the cosmic edifice . Following the nomenclature of elements 92 and 93 , element 94 was named after the planet Pluto . The great-grandchild of uranium , named after Uranus , god of the heavens , thus bears the name of the god of death . Strangely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the two elements named after them , entered the realm of being after they had existed for some time in the realm of ideas . The two planets and the two elements are both outstanding examples of the materialization of intellectual concepts . Neptune was discovered first by mathematical calculations , based on a disturbance in the motion of Uranus , which enabled the astron- omers Adams and Leverrier to predict correctly not only the existence of the unknown planet but also its size and exact position . Similarly Pluto was discovered following a prediction of its existence by Percival Lowell , also made on the basis of variations in the motion of Uranus . In the same manner , neptunium and plutonium were discovered as the result of predictions , based on the nuclear reactions of uranium with neutrons . It will be remembered that the whole story of fission came as the direct result of an attempt to create an element beyond uranium . It was another case in which the quest of a passage to the Indies led to the discovery of a new continent . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and other elements beyond them , turned out to be fission products of uranim . Yet the hope of creating a true transuranic element was never given up , and the discovery that U.238 absorbed neutrons without being split made it practically certain on theoretical grounds that , while U.235 underwent fission , U.238 was transmuted into a new element , or elements , by fission-liberated neutrons . However , in spite of many attempts to discover these hypothetical true transuranic elements , no experimental proof of their actual creation could be found during 1939 and the early months of 1940 . The difficulties in the way were enormous . There was no pure U.238 or U.235 . The best experimental method available was to bombard natural uranium with neutrons by means of the cyclotron . This , of course , led to the fission of the U.235 in the uranium sample and the creation of a host of highly radioactive fission fragments . If in the process some U.238 atoms were transmuted into a transuranic element , the sample was too small to be identified amid the whirlwind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plaguing  | the nuclear chemists and physicists , this time by their absence instead of their presence . Whereas before there had been too many of them to be accounted for legitimately , they had now managed to hide themselves completely in the atomic jungle . From bewildering realities they had changed into elemental ghosts . As has often happened before in the history of scientific discovery , the first glimpse of the ghost came by chance , but it was the sort of chance that , in the words of Pasteur , " favors the prepared mind . " For many months Dr. McMillan and Dr. Abelson had been methodically investigating the fission products of U.235 . By means of a technique developed by Dr. Abelson for identifying radioactive substances by their characteristic X-rays , with which he had come very close to the discovery of fission , they had set out to classify the various ingredients in the brew of the fission caldron . At the same time they were not unmindful of the possibility that the mixture might also yield at least one of the elusive transuranium elements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1940 they noticed a newcomer . Unlike the fission products , which recoiled with tremendous energy , this stranger kept apart from them , displaying very little kinetic energy as compared with the others . This indicated at once that it was not a product of fission of 1J.235 , hit more likely a new radioactive isotope of uranium , which , not having been split , did not possess the great energy imparted by the broken-up U.235 nucleus to its fragments . Radioactive elements can be used as tracers . Even amounts so minute that they can not be seen can be detected through their radioactivity . By using various reagents and precipitants , it can he determined which of these carries the radioactive substance along with it , and  | this , in turn , provides information on the chemical properties of the unknown radioactive substance . With such methods Drs . McMillan and Abelson were able to determine , by May 1940 , that the unknown radioactive substance was element 93 , born through the emission of an electron by U.239 , which in turn had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In their published report , which appeared on June 15 , 1940 , they also described a method for separating neptunium from the other known elements , based on the chemical properties revealed through tracer quantities of the new element . The report further pointed out that , since neptunium had been observed to emit an electron , " element 94 was certainly present in the neptunium decay product . " They were unable , however , to demonstrate the presence of element 94 , since it was present in amounts too minute for detection even by radioactivity . Before they could proceed with this work , Dr. McMillan was called away to work on microwave radar at the newly formed radiation laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , Cambridge , Massachusetts , while Dr. Abelson , who had completed his work for his Ph.D. , left to take a position with the Carnegie Institution of Washington . Dr. Glenn T. Seaborg , of the University of California chemistry department , wrote to Dr. McMillan and Dr. Abelson for permission to carry on the work in search of element 94 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but also turned over to him all their unpublished data and ideas . By December 20 , 1940 , Dr. Scaborg , in collaboration with Dr. Joseph W. Kennedy and Arthur C. Wahl ( at that time a graduate student in chemistry ) , and with the co-operation of Dr. McMillan through  | correspondence , succeeded in producing a new substance by the bombardment of uranium with the nuclei of heavy hydrogen ( deuterons ) fired by the cyclotron . However , at that time the new substance could only be partially identified as element 94 . While this work was in progress in California , a conference of far-reaching import was held at Columbia University on December 15 , 1940 , between Drs . Fermi , Lawrence , and Emilio Sege , of the University of California , a former associate of Fermi in Rome . Fermi was at that time already at work on a chain-reacting pile , and he strongly suspected even at that early date that in such a pile the U.238 would be transmuted into plutonium . The implications of this hypothesis were enormous , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fissionable properties as U.235 and would have the tremendous advantage of being separable by chemical means . In a word , it would mean that fissionable material could be produced in the quantities necessary for atomic bombs . The work of McMillan and Abelson in creating neptunium , and particularly t heir observation that it emitted electrons and thus was most likely transmuted into element 94 , furnished the first experimental proof that the hypothesis was correct . Only one more step was necessary to make the evidence conclusive ? to make actual observations of the transmutation . This would require performing the McMillan-Abelson experiments on a much larger scale , so that a sufficient amount of element 94 ( it had not yet been named ) would be produced . This , in substance , was the subject of the conference that day at Columbia University . It led to the momentous decision to push the work on 94 as vigorously as possible . It was further realized that , in order to reproduce conditions that would prevail in the pile , it would  | be necessary to use neutrons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uranium . On March 1 , 1941 Drs . Scaborg , Sege , Kennedy , and Lawrence proceeded to bombard about one kilogram of uranium with neutrons . It was the largest amount of any substance ever subjected to bombardment by the cyclotron . For six days and nights this terrific bombardment against the citadel of the uranium nucleus was carried on . On March 6 they succeeded . As in the McMillanAbelson experiments , the uranium had been transmuted into neptunium . And , beautiful to behold , they found that the neptunium had in turn , by the emission of an electron , been metamorphosed into a new element . The newcomer announced his arrival by a shower of alpha particles , telltale radiations that theory had predicted as characteristic of element 94 , plutonium . Man had produced the first made-to-order element in history , but the great test was yet to come . By March 28 about one half of a microgram of plutonium 239 had been produced . This the scientists proceeded to bombard with slow neutrons to determine whether it was subject to fission in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tense group stood around the oscilloscope . They saw the ionization pulses in the atomic thermometer rise to the same peaks produced by the fission of U.235 . The news traveled quickly to the Uranium Committee in Washington . It reached the physics laboratory at Columbia University . It gave the Atomic Bomb Project , at that time still tentative , a new impetus and a new direction . Work then proceeded vigorously on the production of further amounts of plutonium . To increase the yield it became highly desirable to procure sonic metallic uranium , practically non-existent at that time . On consulting Professor Gilbert N. Lewis , it was learned that some  | fourteen years before , one of his students , a native of Sweden , had prepared a fairly large sample of metallic uranium of a high degree of purity . No , one knew what had become of the uranium or of the student . Through the Swedish Legation it was learned that he had returned to Sweden . An urgent cable was sent to him asking the whereabouts of the precious metal . Came back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It had been there for fourteen years . As the result of the discovery of neptunium and plutonium , Drs . Seaborg and M. L. Perlman made a search for these elements in pitchblende and found evidence of the existence of plutonium . to the extent of about one part to 100,000 billion parts of pitchblende by weight . They ascribe this amount present in the ore as being due to the continuous absorption by U.238 of an appreciable fraction of the neutrons that are continually emitted during the spontaneous fission of uranium . This indicates that plutonium is also being constantly created in nature , the only known example of creation still going on . When the building of plutonium-producing piles was under considerat ion in 1942 , some of the scientists feared that it might take too long to work out the chemical procedures for its seperation . Dr. Scahorg , however , felt confident that it could be done in a reasonable time . Since no more than microgram amounts could be made by the cyclotron , Seaborg and his associates started work on the ultramicro scale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was isolated on August 18 , 1942 , by Drs . B. B. Cunningham and L. B. Werner , and a number of further compounds were made a month later . On the basis of these " bits of nothing " they proceeded to design a huge chemical plant to scale , the microgram amounts serving as a pilot plant for actual operations some ten billion times greater in scope .  | To do so they had to use a host of other chemicals in exact proportions , in quantities of micrograms and fractions of micrograms , within a limit of accuracy of three per cent . ( A human breath weighs about 750,000 micrograms . ) To achieve this unheard-of accuracy in weighing , an ultramicro balance of an extremely high sensitivity was designed and built by P. L. Kirk and R. D. Craig of the University of California . This balance could weigh amounts as small as a microgram with an accuracy of three per cent , and could actually weigh a mass as small as 0.03 micrograms . Work continued on approximately this scale of operation until about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became available . There soon followed experiments on the gram and then on the tengram scale . Following these the scale became substantially larger . On the basis of these ultramicro-scale procedures a large pilot plant was built at the Clinton Engineer Works , where the chemistry for concentrating and purifying plutonium was further developed under the direction of Professor Warren Johnson , of the University of Chicago , and Major Oswald H. Greager , formerly of the du Pont Company . Before this pilot plant was completed , however , work began on three huge separation plants at the Hanford Engineer Works . These plants , rectangular structures 800 feet long , are the most remarkable chemical factories ever conceived or designed . In them enormous quantities of materials are made to go through complicated chemical processes with no human eye ever seeing what actually goes on except through an intricate series of dials and panels that enable the operators to maintain perfect control of every single operation at all times . Each operation is performed in a remote cell behind  | thick walls , and when it is completed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , until at the end of a series of such passages the miracle of modern alchemy emerges , ready for the next stage on its ultimate journey . The remote-control operation was made necessary because the plutonium comes associated with the fission products of U.235 , which emit an amount of radiation that would be lethal to any life in its vicinity . Hanford Engineer Works is located in Benton County , in the south-central portion of the state of Washington , between the Yakima Range and the Columbia River . It lies on the undulating tableland containing for the most part a desolate region of gray sand , gray-green sagebrush , and dried watercourses . The region is drained by the Columbia River , east of the Cascades , where the Rattlesnake Hills , Saddle Mountains , and Yakima Range form the inland extremities of that system and constitute a plant barricade to the south , north , and west . The nearest community of any size is Yakima , some forty miles westward , which has a normal population of about 30,000 . The manufacturing area lies entirely on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ River , which bounds it to the north and northwest . ' 1'hc nunmfacturing reservation is nearly level , broken promiucilt ly only by Cable Mountain , an outcropping of basalt that underlies the entire site , usually at a considerable depth . The overburden consists of a poorly cemented shale and sandstone stratum known as the Ellensburg Formation , above which are deposits of sand and gravel , chiefly alluvial . The area owned or controlled through lease amounts to approximately 631 square miles . Of this total , 230 square miles are owned by the Government . The manufacturing reservation contains 195 square miles . The remaining area is accounted for by the purchase of power  | and irrigation properties and rights , and by the acquisition of Richland Village , to the south of the manufacturing area , as a site for the housing development and the administration center . Leased property is either on a basis of no occupancy or controlled occupancy as warranted by considerations of safety and security . For the protection of employees and the public generally , monitor stations are strategically located in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of land owned and leased . The manufacturing area is divided into three huge sections , and each of these three is subdivided into subsections covering miles of ground . One of the three main areas contains the three great chain-reacting piles for the production of plutonium . The second area contains the three chemical plants where the plutonium is separated and concentrated . The third area is where the raw material for the plutonium piles is prepared . The three piles are located on the south bank of the Columbia River at the northern extremity of the manufacturing reservation . Each of the piles is bounded by some 4.1 miles of fence , overlooked by guard towers located , at most , 2,000 feet apart . Within the fence lie some 685 acres of land , 4.25 miles of broad-gauge track , and 6.75 miles of roads . The three plants are completely self-contained . Each is about seven to eight miles distant from the next one . The nearest to Richland Village is thirty miles away . The construction of the Hanford Engineer Works presented innumerable and unprecedented problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and development , engineering design , and policy . The principal factors that created these problems were : the magnitude of the project ; the distances between the several manufacturing plants to be con- structed ; the isolated location of the site ; the time element , which demanded that construction proceed without awaiting completion of engineering design ; the unusually high quality of construction required in many instances ; and the extreme and rigid requirements of military secrecy . The magnitude of the work of construction is indicated by the following general items selected at random : Excavation amounted to 25,000,000 cubic yards of earth , a quantity approximately one fourth of the earth moved in the construction of the Fort Peck Dam , the largest earth dam ever constructed . A total of 40,000 carloads of material were received on the site , equivalent to a train 333 miles long . More than 780,000 cubic yards of concrete were placed , an amount approximately equal to 390 miles of concrete highway twenty feet wide and six inches thick . Excluding railroad rail and special steels , about 40,000 tons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board feet of lumber were required , equivalent to the yield from 135 acres of the best timberland . About 1,500,000 concrete blocks and 750,000 cement bricks were used in plant construction ; more than 11,000 poles were required for the electric power and lighting systems ; more than 8,500 pieces of construction equipment were used . Approximately 345 miles of permanent plant roads were constructed on the site . The necessity for separating the several areas from each other and from inhabited localities by relatively great distances imposed abnormal problems for the transportation of men and materials . These distances are emphasized by the fact that 340,000,000 passenger-miles of bus transportation were furnished during the construction phase of the work . The isolation of the site from any existing centers of  | population presented serious problems with respect to many phases of construction . These were related primarily to the procurement , transportation , housing , feeding , health , morale , and retention of a maximum total construction force of about 45,000 persons , a total reached in June 1944 . The urgent need for putting the plant in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a number of instances to proceed with construction before basic research had been fully developed . Steps had to be taken that , in the words of Professor Smyth , " no engineer or scientist in his right mind would consider in peacetime , " and could be justified even in wartime only by the " possibility of achieving tremendously important results . " There is as much difference between the first chainreacting pile at Chicago and the giant plutonium piles at the Hanford Engineer Works as there is between a toy popgun and a battery of the most powerful modern artillery . Essentially they are both latticeworks of graphite and uranium , in which a chain reaction perpetuates itself through the liberation of neutrons by the fission of U.235 in unseparated uranium , and the slowing down of the neutrons in the graphite . But , by comparison , the first is a crude shack alongside the Empire State Building . The actual size and power of the Hanford piles can not be given . Nevertheless , some relative data may prove illuminating . Before building the piles at Hanford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Engineer Works to serve as a pilot plant . As it turned out , the Hanford piles were designed along different engineering lines , but for purposes of comparison the Clinton pile is much closer to the ones at Hanford than to the Chicago prototype . Originally designed to operate at a power of a 1,000 kilowatts , which corresponds to the  | splitting of less than one milligram of U.235 per day , it reached a power level of 1,800 kilowatts in May 1944 . This Clinton pile was thus 9,000 times more powerful than the Chicago pile . Yet it is a mere pygmy alongside any of the Hanford giants . The construction of these mammoth atomic piles required the solution of many problems of a type and a scale never encountered before . The first problem , of course , was to design a practical plant that would produce plutonium in sufficient quantities for atomic bombs . This end could not be achieved by merely scaling up the Chicago model , as it would have taken five million of these to produce just one kilogram a day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature , not merely larger in size . A pile in which large quantities of U.235 are being split generates radiations equivalent to those of tons of radium . Hence the piles had to be surrounded by concrete walls several feet thick . Since these radiations are greater by far than anything ever encountered before , they created one of the greatest health problems ever faced . To meet the challenge , a staff of several hundred of the country 's leading radiologists , under the direction of Colonel Warren and I ) r . R. S. Stone , was organized to carry out pioneer studies in this unknown field and to devise new methods for the effective protection of all personnel . The greater the power at which the pile is operated , the greater is the energy liberated in the form of heat . This heat is equivalent to that of burning 3,000,000 kilograms of coal per kilogram of 1J.235 used up in fission , and if not efficiently carried off , it might vaporize the pile and lead to the greatest of catastrophes . The cooling problem was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pile . It had at first been decided to use  | helium as the coolant . For various reasons it was finally decided to use water . This created enormous engineering problems . To carry off the amounts of heat generated in the pile would require the circulation of a quantity of water large enough to supply a fair-sized city . Furthermore , since this water would become hot , it in turn would have to be cooled before it was returned to the Columbia River , as otherwise it might raise the temperature of the river to a point incompatible with fish life . If it was decided that the water could go through the system only once , a huge retention basin would have to be designed so as to allow the radioactivity induced in the water to die down before the water could be returned to the river . The decision to use water as the coolant also opened up another serious problem . To load and unload the pile , the uranium is shaped in the form of cylinders , which are inserted in channels passing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cylinders , they are pushed out by remote control into a deep water basin in the rear of the pile , whence they are transferred to the chemical separation plant . Since the heat develops in the uranium , the water would have to circulate in contact with it through the channels in the graphite . The indications were that the uranium would react chemically with the water , probably to the point of disintegrating the uranium cylinders . Hence it became necessary to seal the uranium in a protective can made of a material that had to meet a number of stringent requirements : it must not absorb too many neutrons ; it had to transmit heat from the uranium to the water ; it had to protect uranium from water corrosion ; it had to withstand the terrific heat ; it had to have a high resistance against the radiations ; and it had to keep fission products out of the water . The failure of a  | single can might result in putting an entire pile out of operation . The problem of the can proved to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smyth reports that on his periodic visits to Chicago , where the problem was being studied along with the other problems relating to the pile , " he could roughly estimate the state of the canning problem by the atmosphere of gloom or joy he found around the laboratory . " Aluminum had been decided on as the material best suited for the purpose , but several very troublesome problems still remained . It proved very difficult to get a uniform , heat-conducting bond between the aluminum and the uranium . Nor was it found possible to effect a gas-tight closure for the can . The final solution did not come until October 1944 , after the first Hanford pile had begun operations . Another problem involved the radioactive gases developed as fission products in the pile . High stacks were built to carry them off , but since the behavior of these gases is dependent on the weather , meteorological studies were made over a period of many months to determine whether the stack gases would be likely to spread radioactive fission products in dangerous concentrations . The studies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working out of specifications for the operation of the stacks . The energy from the piles is heating the Columbia River , but the actual rise in temperature is so small that no effect was to be expected on fish life . A series of elaborate experiments confirmed this expectation . The Hanford piles are the first atomic power plants built on earth , atomic boilers generating enormous amounts of atomic energy in the form of heat . In these boilers atoms by the trillions are ripped asunder and new elements are constantly being created . Many of  | these , fission products distinct from plutonium , have great potential value in biology , medicine , and industry . Thus the atomic pile is actually a three-in-one plant : It creates large quantities of plutonium . It produces a host of valuable new radioactive elements . It liberates a vast amount of atomic energy , which today goes to heat the Columbia , but promises more utilitarian applications for tomorrow . To behold these atomic power plants standing in their primeval majesty is one of the most terrifying and aweinspiring spectacles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the slightest hint , that within these huge man-made blocks titanic cosmic fires are raging such as had never raged on earth in its present form . One stands before them as though beholding the realization of a vision such as Michelangelo might have had of a world yet to be , as indescribable as the Grand Canyon of Arizona , Beethoven 's Ninth Symphony , or the presence " whose dwelling is the light of setting suns . " In these Promethean structures , which may well stand as eternal monuments to the spirit of man challenging nature , mighty cosmic forces are at work such as had never been let loose on this planet in the million years of man 's existence on its surface , and probably never in the two billion years of the earth 's being . Here , for the first time in history , man stands in the presence of the very act of elemental creation of matter . Here in the great silences ? for the plants operate in a stillness where even the beating of one 's heart can be heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as far as man knows , has not happened since Genesis . This development no doubt will rank in the future story of mankind as a definite landmark , signalizing a new cultural age , the Age of Atomics , or of Nucleonics , as some scientists prefer to designate it . For this there is  | no parallel . All the great ages ? the Iron Age , the Bronze Age , the ages of steam and electricity , each of which revolutionized conditions of living ? arrived imperceptibly , and man did not become aware of them until their effects were fully felt . This marks the first time in the history of man 's struggle to bend the forces of nature to his will that he is actually present at the birth of a new era on this planet , with full awareness of its titanic potentialities for good or evil . One is reassured on seeing the most remarkable system of automatic controls , and controls of controls , devised to keep this man-made Titan from breaking his bonds . Left without control for even a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the mass is , its mechanisms and controls are adjusted with the fineness of the most delicate jeweled watch , and they respond with the sensitiveness of a fine Stradivarius . The slightest deviation from normal behavior , and the automatic controls go into operation . ' hey can stop the Titan in his tracks almost instantly .  | AS early as March 1939 , only about a month after the announcement of the discovery of fission in this country , Dr. Fermi went to Washington to arouse the interest of our Army and Navy in the possible use of fission for military purposes . In a conference with representatives of the Navy Department , he suggested the possibility of achieving either a controllable reaction with slow neutrons , or an uncontrolled reaction , producing an explosion of a magnitude previously undreamed of , with fast neutrons . It was recognized that the amount of U.235 that would be necessary to make a bomb would not be very large , as in pure U.235 the principal competitor for the available neutrons ? namely , U.238 ? would not be present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would go into producing further fissions ; and since these are fast neutrons , the fissions would take place at an incredibly rapid rate , producing an explosion of cataclysmic dimensions . However , in a mass of U.235 , neutrons would be lost by escape into the outer air , and if too many of them were to be lost in this way , the combustion of the U.235 atoms ? that is , fission ? would die out like a fire that lacks air . Since , as explained earlier , the production of  | neutrons , which is a volume effect , will increase more rapidly with size than the loss by escape into the air , which is a surface effect , this loss by escape can be reduced by increasing the size of the mass to the point at which enough neutrons will be liberated and retained inside the mass to produce the explosion . This means that no explosion can take place unless you have a minimum mass of material , a minimum known as the critical size . It can thus be seen that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ordinary chemical explosion of TNT and other explosives . In these , any quantity , no matter how small , can be exploded , while no quantity , no matter how large , will explode by itself if the proper precautions are taken . In atomic material , however , the explosion can occur only if the quantity reaches this critical amount . Quantities of the material less than the critical amount are perfectly stable and safe . On the other hand , a quantity greater than this critical amount will go off automatically by itself , and no power on earth can stop it . I can therefore reveal to you the principal secret of the atomic bomb : all you have to do to explode an atomic bomb is to unite at great rapidity two pieces of the active material , cacti sinalkr than the critical amount , but exceeding it when brought together . As Dr. Robert Williams , one of the earliest scientists to arrive at the atomic bomb center at Los Alamos put it : " Take some fissionable material in several pieces , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as possible . " This , however , is not so simple as it sounds . As the British statement points out , if an appreciable fraction of the atoms of U.235 undergo fission within a very short time , the amount of energy liberated will be so great that the mass will attain a temperature of " many million degrees and a pressure of many millions of atmospheres. "  | It will consequently expand with very great rapidity . As the density of the mass decreases , the neutrons can escape more easily from it , and the chain reaction will come to end . In order to release an appreciable fraction of the available energy , it is therefore necessary that the reaction should develop so rapidly that a substantial part of the material can react before the system has time to fly apart . The neutrons produced in the fission process are fast enough to fulfill this condition , but not if the neutrons are artificially slowed down . How , then , can subcritical masses of U.235 be brought together rapidly enough to avoid predetonation ? IIere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a projectile in a gun against a second part as a target . This , again , is not too easy , of course . As Professor Smyth points out , the projectile mass , projectile speed , and gun caliber required were not far from the range of standard ordnance practice , but novel problems were introduced by the importance of achieving sudden and perfect contact between projectile and target , by the use of a tamper to reflect escaping neutrons back into the mass , and by the requirement of portability . In these last two phrases are revealed more vital secrets of the atomic bomb . This requires some explanation . The critical size of a uranium-graphite pile , as well as that of an atomic bomb , may be considerably reduced by an envelope made of a substance that reflects neutrons . In a chain-reacting pile this envelope consists of a layer of graphite . In the case of the bomb the most effective envelope is a substance having a high density . Such a neutron-reflecting envelope is known as a tamper . In the bomb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus saving precious material , but also plays an additional part : its very inertia , as Professor Smyth points  | out , delays the expansion of the active substance , and makes for a longer-lasting , more energetic , and more efficient explosion . By a fortunate coincidence , materials of high density are also excellent as reflectors for neutrons . Since gold is one of those materials , it was at one time seriously contemplated putting some of the gold hoard buried at Fort Knox to work in the atomic bomb , just as the idle silver in the Treasury was put to work in one of the plants for concentrating the U.235 for the bomb . ' Here , then , is the third secret of the atomic bomb : the use of an envelope surrounding the active material as a tamper , to decrease the critical size and greatly to increase the bomb 's efficiency . Secret number four is that this tamper is made of material of high density . Gold is such a material , if anyone wants to blow it up , which may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a war with atomic bombs . Secret number five is of course easily guessed at : portability . Since the atomic bomb had to be dropped from a bomber , its weight and shape had to be within the limits of what a B-29 could carry . Since the maximum load for a B-29 from the Marianas to japan was ten tons , it is obvious that the atomic bomb could not have a total weight of more than that maxinnuu . How much is the critical amount ? This is still one of the great secrets , but even here an approximation within rather narrow limits can be made . In the summer of 1940 a figure of one to one hundred kilograms of U.235 was commonly given as the critical size of the bomb . Now , President Truman has stated that the bomb that wiped out Hiroshima " had more power than 20,000 tons of TNT . " According to the figure given in the Official Report , one kilogram of U.235 , if all the atoms in it underwent fission , would release energy equivalent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if the  | efficiency of the explosion over Iliroshima was one hundred per cent , the active material in that bomb weighed no more than one kilogram ( 2.2 pounds ) . If the efficiency of the nuclear explosion was only one per cent , then the amount of the material used was one hundred kilograms . On the other hand , the Official Report states on page 63 that by the end of 1941 " it was predicted that possibly ten per cent of the total energy might he released explosively . " On the basis of that prediction ( which may or may not have proved to be true ) , the critical amount of the Hiroshima bomb was ten kilograms . Suppose the critical amount was found to be 100 kilograms . Anything below that amount would therefore be perfectly stable and safe ; no power on earth could make it explode . Hence we divide the 100 kilograms into two parts , let 's say , of seventy and thirty kilograms respectively . We assemble these two parts in a high-speed gun in which the heavier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the projectile . When the two are far enough apart , they are , of course , harmless . When the time comes to explode it , a mechanism is set to make the gun go off at a certain predetermined distance from the ground . When that happens , the projectile hits the target and brings the two parts together . A critical mass is formed and there is one less city in the world . As soon as the parts join , the neutrons build up so rapidly that the explosion takes place in about one tenth of a millionth of a second . One more secret may be cleared up . The bomb was not dropped by parachute , as is commonly believed . It was dropped free . It is true that the Japanese saw something drop by parachute and thus gave rise to the common misconception , but what they saw were instruments dropped by parachutes from the accompanying plane to make blast measurements . It was through these instru- ments that President Truman was able to state as a fact that the bomb " had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much does the entire assembly weigh ? The exact amount is being kept secret , but it may be said that it weighs several tons and , as General Farrell has stated in a public address , " it substantially fills the bomb bay of a B-29 . " The bomb is detonated in combat at such a height above the ground as to give the maximum blast effect against structures , and to disseminate the radioactive products as a cloud . On account of the height of the explosion , as the War Department pointed out , " practically all the radioactive products are carried upward in the ascending column of hot air and dispersed harmlessly over a wide area . Even in the New Mexico test , where the height of explosion was necessarily low , only a very small fraction of the radioactivity was deposited immediately below the bomb . " While the energy released in the fission of all the atoms in a kilogram of U.235 is equivalent to that of 20,000 tons of TNT , this energy represents the conversion of only one thousandth of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The conversion of one gram of matter into energy thus produces the equivalent of 20,000 tons of TNT . Since the bomb dropped over Hiroshima had a power of about 20,000 tons , it means that the destruction of that city was caused by the conversion into energy of only one gram of matter . This conversion took place in one tenth of a millionth of a second , or at a rate of 10,000,000 million grams , more than 10,000 tons , per second . As the sun , which produces its radiation by the conversion of matter into energy , is one third of a million times the mass of the earth , the sun should be convert- ing its matter at the rate of 3,000 million tons per second . Since it does this at the rate of only 4 million tons per second , the conversion of the matter in the Hiroshima bomb was at a rate 750 times faster than the rate at which energy in the sun is created out of matter . In that one tenth of a millionth of a second vast cosmic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as our present knowledge goes , only in the super exploding stars known as super-novae , giant stellar bodies vastly greater than our sun , which , for some unknown reason , explode in interstellar space and shine with the light of a billion suns for a relatively short time . The temperature at the time of the atomic explosion at Hiroshima , according to testimony before the Special Committee on Atomic Energy of the United States Senate by Dr. Philip Morrison , one of our brilliant young nuclear physicists , reached 100,000,000 degrees Fahrenheit ( 55,000,000 degrees centigrade ) in its center . This is about three times as great as the temperature estimated for the interior of the sun , and nearly ten thousand times the temperature of the sun 's surface . To attain an internal temperature of such magnitude would require a star with the luminosity of 400,000,000 suns , or 400 ordinary novae combined into one . The pressure attained during an atomic explosion is even more staggering in its dimensions , reaching hundreds of billions of atmospheres . The energy generated by an atomic bomb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ten per cent efficiency , is enough to raise the entire United States wartime fleet of 9,000,000 displacement tons nearly two miles into the air . At this point some misconception must be cleared up as to the total maximum amount of fission energy in a given mass available for the explosion , which must not be confused with the total amount of energy actually contained  | in that mass if all the matter in it were to be converted into energy , according to the Einstein formula for the equivalence of mass and energy . The maximum amount of fission energy available for an explosion in any given mass of U.235 or plutonium is only one tenth of one per cent of the total energy contained in that mass . If we state , for example , that one kilogram of U.235 , when exploding with one hundred per cent efficiency , would release energy equivalent to 20,000 short tons of TNT , that amount would represent only one tenth of one per cent , or one thousandth part , of the total energy contained in that kilogram . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that kilogram , on the basis of the Einstein formula ( see Chapter II ) , if all its matter could be converted into energy , would be the equivalent of 20 , - 000,000 short tons of TNT . In the process of fission , however , only one thousandth part of the matter is converted into energy . Furthermore , this one thousandth of the total energy is all that we can get or ever will get out of uranium or plutonium . It represents one hundred per cent of the total energy available for the explosion . If we state that the explosion went off with ten per cent efficiency we mean one tenth of one thousandth , not one tenth of the total energy the entire mass . That is the way nature has arranged it , and there is nothing man can do about it . All he can do is to take advantage of what nature has given him and use her bounty up to the limit ? that is , one tenth of one per cent , which in the case of uranium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the total energy available for man 's use . The reason for this is not hard to find . Every unit of atomic mass is the equivalent in energy of 1,000,000,000 ( one billion ) electron volts ( an electron volt is a very small fraction of an erg , unit of work ) . Since an atom of  | U.235 is composed of 235 such units , the total mass of the atom of U.235 has an energy equivalent of 235,000 , - 000,000 electron volts . But in the process of fission only 200,000,000 electron volts of energy are liberated ; that is , only one fifth of a unit of mass of the 235 units in the atom , or 1/1,175 of the atom 's mass , is converted into energy . This is roughly only 1/12 per cent , but in round figures it is generally given as 1/10 of one per cent ? namely , one part per thousand . It can not be overemphasized that this rather small percentage is the maximum available . That is all there is ; no power known to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is just as immutable a law of nature as is the law of gravitation , and we can no more change it than we can change the pull of gravity at a given point . But this small amount is certainly a tremendous trifle . To illustrate : A bomb containing one hundred kilograms of U.235 , if all its atoms were to undergo fission , would liberate the energy equivalent to 2,000,000 short tons of TNT . If only ten per cent of its atoms undergo fission , the energy liberated would still be the equivalent of 200,000 tons of TNT , or ten times more powerful than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima . Thus the power of the bomb can be increased either by increasing its size or by improving its efficiency , or both . Since the bomb dropped on Nagasaki , three days after the Hiroshima bomb , made the first one obsolete , there can be little doubt that within the next ten years we may expect to have atomic bombs of a power equivalent to 100,000 to 250,000 tons of TNT . Such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only cities but whole areas . They could cripple a nation and destroy its power of resistance in a few minutes . Such bombs , of course , will not be carried by airplane.  | Long-range rockets , using atomic energy for fuel , could travel to any part of the globe at speeds of thousands of miles per hour , at altitudes of several hundred miles . It would even be impossible under these circumstances to tell where these rockets came from . The nation attacked would be staggering in the dark in a frantic effort to find out who the enemy was . The friendliness of a nation would be no guarantee of innocence , since the diplomacy of the atomic age would call for the outward appearance of the utmost friendliness to avert suspicion when the atomic bombs began to fall . A nation starting such an atomic war would not necessarily do so because it was bent on aggression . Living in constant fear , day by day , hour by hour , minute by minute , and second by second , that at any moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tension must sooner or later become unendurable . It would take only a few , trigger-happy men at the pushbuttons to start pushing them frantically in the conviction that by doing so they were only beating the other fellows to the push . The nation to start it would most likely be the one whose nerves were the first to crack under the strain . The start of an atomic war would thus probably be an expression of a primitive , animal-like fear of the unknown . Unless lie takes wise measures in time , and that means now , man of the atomic age will by force of necessity revert to the animal . Ile will retrogress 500 , - 000 years , all the way back to the cave he started from , except that this time he will have the means to annihilate himself . On the other hand , since , as Professor Oppenheimer pointed out , atomic bombs of the future will be cheap , plentiful , and easy to make , small nations will have them as well as large . Hence , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark night , the responsibility  | could by no means be pinned on any one , or on several , of the small number of great industrial powers . Since these powers would have much more to lose from an atomic bomb war , it would be more likely that an ambitious military clique that had gained control over a small nation , as is the case with Argentina , Spain , and several other small powers , might decide the time had come for them to have their fling at the dice of destiny , with everything to gain and rather little to lose . Man collectively may become Ishmael , a " wild man " ; " his hand will be against every man , and every man 's hand against him . "  | THE point in space where the atomic bomb was born is now known to the world as Los Alamos . As in the case of Oak Ridge , there was no town by that name on that spot . At the beginning there was only a canyon , named Los Alamos , after its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large mesa overlooking the canyon became the site of the Los Alamos Ranch School for boys , where the pupils , if they had a mind to , could do their algebra on horseback . Los Alamos is only one of many breath-taking canyons , separated by mesas with steeply sloping sides , often dropping abruptly a sheer hundred and fifty feet to the treetops or brush on the canyon 's floor . South of Los Alamos are several other canyons , running parallel to each other on an east-west line to the Rio Grande ? Pajarito , Water , Frijoles , Bayo , Pueblo , Guaje , Valle , and Sandia canyons , all part of Los Alamos . Among the plateaus are One-mile Mesa and Two-mile Mesa , South Mesa and Upper South Mesa . A large ranch west of Parajito Canyon , named Anchor Ranch , served as the proving ground for the gun assembly of the bomb . As the crow flies , Los Alamos lies twenty-five miles northwest of Santa Fe , but there is no way of getting there by a straight route . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little Spanish-American town of Espanola , then turn back and drive in a southwesterly direction over a tortuous road that winds its way for sixteen miles through the tableland overlooking the precipitous canyons to one 's right . This road was only a trail when it was taken over by the atomic scientists . Over it , night and day , came a steady procession of trucks carrying cyclotrons and betatrons , CockcroftWalton proton accelerators , and Van de Graaff highvoltage spheres , special gadgets made in hundreds of plants and universities throughout the land , crates of U.235 from all the plants at Oak Ridge , and cargoes of plutonium from the giant piles at Hanford . Over this road traveled , incognito , many of the world 's great . On it were carried the finished products for Alamogordo , Hiroshima , and Nagasaki . It was only a little road , but during the summer of 1945 it became one of the world 's great highways . On it traveled the substance that changed the course of history . But for this road , Los Alamos is inaccessible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the west and the Sangre de Cristo Range , with the Truchas Peaks rising to a height of 13,80 ( feet , to the east . Deep canyons bar the approaches from the north and south . All about are monuments of the great past , Indian , Spanish , Mexican , American . To the north are prehistoric ruins . The Cliff Dwelling Ruins of the Bandelier National Monument arc to the south . From Frijoles Canyon westward through the Jemez Mountains is the Valle Grande , the largest extinct volcano ever found , its crater fifteen miles in diameter . Past Cochiti and Santo Domingo Indian pueblos to the southwest is the old ghost town of Bland . To the east across the Rio Grande is the northern end of Jornada del Muerto , the Journey of Death . As one progresses from Santa Fe to  | Espanola , one somehow crosses the line from today to yesterday . Somewhere between Espanola and Los Alamos one floats across the gap between yesterday and tomorrow . One suddenly finds oneself transported into the twenty-first century . Geographically Los Alamos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the mesa between Los Alamos and Pueblo canyons . Here , surrounded by a heavily guarded barbed-wire fence , is the Technical Area , where the principal research laboratories and plants are located . In addition to the Tech Area , as it was known , there were twenty other projects , built on the narrow ridges between the canyons , with some located in the canyons themselves . In the summer of 1945 the Tech Area contained 37 buildings , while the structures on the other sites numbered 201 . In addition there were 49 administrative buildings , 52 buildings for the military personnel , 302 apartment buildings containing 620 apartment units , 200 trailers and 52 dormitories . The population consisted of 4,000 civilian and 2,000 military personnel , in command of Colonel Gerald R. Tyler . No place in the world was more heavily guarded than Los Alamos . Its very existence was a top secret . At Hanford and at Oak Ridge it was known among the chosen few as Site-Y . It was the only place where mail was censored and telephone conversations listened in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no post office . Letters to the outside world were handed unsealed to the intelligence officer , who read them and forwarded them to Santa Fe . If they contained objectionable matter , they were given back to the sender . Letters to Los Alamos were addressed to P.O. Box 1539 , Santa Fe , New Mexico . The population in Los Alamos was divided into two distinct classes , each identified by a badge . The mark  | of the highest distinction was a white badge , given only to the top scientists . The white badge , accompanied by an identification card , admitted one to the inner circle and to the various sanctums on the place , including the sanctum sanctorum where the bomb was assembled . By the summer of 1945 the vast majority of the scientists had lived with their families at Los Alamos for about two and a half years . As far as the world knew , they had vanished completely , lost without a trace . Arriving at the place and finding them all there gave one the sensation of discovering a lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided the perfect setting for such a world . One would descend a steep canyon and find a large structure half buried in the ground . Inside the building were men working with the most explosive material on earth . I shall never forget my visit to the building where the Harvard cyclotron was installed . There in front of the apparatus was a huge pile of little cubes . I casually picked one up . " What 's this ? " I asked Professor Robert R. Wilson , who was in charge of the work . " U.235 , " he answered . I looked at the pile . There was enough there to wipe out a city , but the fact that it was cut up in little cubes , separated here and there by neutron-absorbers , kept the mass from becoming critical . Professor Wilson aroused me from the state of catalepsy that the pile had produced in me by inviting me to the next room for tea , brewed in a chemical retort .

On these mesas , and down below in the canyons , the neutron ruled the lives of the people . At Hanford it was a slave , imprisoned in a moderator and shorn of most of its strength . At Los Alamos the fast neutron was king . The principal job at Hanford was to maintain a chain reaction with slow neutrons and put them to work transmuting U.238 into plutonium . At Los Alamos the principal job was to devise means whereby fast untrammeled neutrons would annihilate the plutonium , or U.235 , by liberating its energy through an explosion consuming the shortest possible time . The purpose , in other words , was to create the conditions in which the free untamed neutron could do its work in the most efficient manner contrivable . This was not a job for physicists and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metallurgists and chemists , mathematicians and astrophysicists , engineers and authorities on ballistics , nuclear physicists and nuclear chemists , theoretical scientists and experimentalists , long-hairs and short-hairs . In fact , one of the significant outcomes of the Atomic Bomb Project , and particularly the Los Alamos branch , was the bringing together into a smoothly functioning team of the long-hairs and the short-hairs , who in normal peacetime used to growl at each other from a safe distance . Each learned to respect and admire the other . Oppie , as Dr. Oppenheimer was affectionately called in white-badge and blue-badge circles alike , would , by prewar concepts , have been classed as a long-hair . He is one of the topflight theoretical physicists now living . In his undergraduate days at Harvard he contributed excellent poetry to one of the advanced literary periodicals . As Dr.  | Arthur K. Solomon of Harvard says of him in Why Smash Atoms ? " he has a peculiar power of self-absorption , and the tales of his absent-mindedness are legion . " Yet when called upon to organize the greatest laboratory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and short-hairs working together in harmony , this absent-minded scholar , who now finds the outlet for his poetic vision through higher mathematics , turned out , in his very quiet and soft-spoken way , to be a veritable dynamo of action , animating the entire project with a vitality never seen in any laboratory . Los Alamos will go down in history as Oppie 's greatest poem . The welding together of long-hairs and short-hairs was given daily demonstrations at Los Alamos . In their cubicles the theoretical scientists would sit for many hours working with pieces of colored chalk on a blackboard or with pencil on pads of paper . At frequent intervals one would hear the boom of great explosions on the various proving grounds in the distant canyons . These were in the true sense explosions of ideas in the minds of men . The mathematical symbols on the blackboards and pads of paper were exploding in the canyons below . Thousands of such ideas exploded simultaneously over Alamogordo , and over Japan . ' there were literally hundreds of problems to be solved before the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job unimpeded . One of the principal ones was the accurate determination of the critical mass . Another , of course , was the problem of the efficiency of the explosion . Others involved the proper mechanisms to bring it about . They would have been difficult enough under any circumstances , even under ideal conditions ; but here for a long time the men of Los Alamos had to make bricks without straw . Worse still , they were called upon ' to devise ways for making bricks without  | clay . They had been assigned to make bombs of U.235 and plutonium when even the ground for the plants to produce these substances had not yet been broken . Yet by the time these substances became available , a vast amount of groundwork had been laid by the use of substitute materials , and a great deal of information gathered on the habits , behavior , and mode of action of fast neutrons under a variety of conditions . On the basis of these preliminary facts , the theoretical physicists and mathematicians arrived at a much closer approximation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began trickling in from Oak Ridge and l lanford , they were subjected to tests to check the accuracy of these extrapolations . Step by step experiment was thus correlated with theory , and theory with experiment . By the time enough material was available to make a fullscale model of the bomb , every part had been worked out to the last detail and all that was left to be done was to insert the active material in its proper place . " Each component did exactly what it was expected to do , " Dr. Oppenheimer said to me on the morning after the New Mexico test . Failure of any one of these parts would have meant failure of the whole . On the proper performance of each hung the lives of thousands , or tens of thousands . That none of the parts failed , however , was no accident . Each one of these was subjected to hundreds of tests . These tests were in themselves marvels of ingenuity and inventiveness . One of them , devised by Dr. Oppenheimer and Dr. Robert Serber , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Cornell , made it possible to get an approximation of the forces that would develop inside an atomic bomb at the instant of explosion , without the use of any U.235 or plutonium . Since the explosion takes place in a fraction  | of a microsecond , this was more than taking time by the forelock ; it meant catching it by the tail . The test at Alamogordo climaxed a series of other tests the world has not yet heard about , which in their way were equally spectacular and considerably more daring . As soon as sufficient quantities of the active material to form what the calculations indicated would constitute a critical mass became available , tests were begun to check the accuracy of these calculations . In one of these a strange contraption known as the guillotine was rigged up . It consisted of a large wooden frame divided by two parallel vertical steel rods . To each of these rods was attached a large block of the active material . On top between the rods was suspended a smaller block of the substance . The three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signal the executioner allowed the smaller block to drop through the space between the two larger ones , the three blocks coming together , thus forming a critical mass for a fraction of a second . The guillotine was hooked up with a series of neutron-counters that registered the neutron flux at the time of criticality . In another series of experiments a pile containing uranium and a moderator was built . The moderator , of course , made it a slow-neutron chain-reacting pile . Then bit by bit the moderator was removed , thus gradually changing the slow-neutron reaction to a reaction with fast neutrons , approaching more and more closely the conditions prevailing in the bomb . This model of the atomic bomb was located in one of the semi-underground structures in one of the canyons . The scientists devised a series of extremely sensitive automatic controls that were to stop the reaction if it showed any signs of getting too close to critical . Outside , in the moonlit canyon , six motorcars with their engines running , their drivers tense at the wheels , were ready  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Dr. O. R. Frisch , the same Dr. Frisch who , with Dr. Meitner , was the first to demonstrate the fission of uranium . The controls worked . Dr. Frisch and his small band returned to their homes on the mesa at the break of dawn . They were all set for Alamogordo . The great cloud of fire that rose more than eight miles to the stratosphere over the New Mexico desert symbolized a funeral pyre for the Japanese Empire . The select few who witnessed the spectacle knew for certain at the instant of the explosion that the new weapon would prove decisive in a relatively short time . No power on earth , everyone realized , could stand up against the elemental force liberated in those bombs . Ten minutes after the explosion the following dialogue took place between General Farrell and General Groves : General Farrell : " The war is over ! " General Groves : " Yes , it is over as soon as we drop one or two on Japan ! " The weeks preceding the test , when the scientists were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most dramatic scenes in the history of scientific endeavor . The decision to make the test had opened up a host of serious problems . A site had to be found far away from inhabited localities . Measures had to be taken to prevent the tremendous thunderbolt , which was expected to be seen and heard for hundreds of miles , from giving away our greatest secret . Apparatus and techniques had to be devised to study , from a distance of several miles , entirely by automatic controls , phenomena that occur in less than a millionth of a second . These included measurements of what takes place inside the atomic bomb at the time of explosion ; the amounts and types of energy released ; the effect ,  | intensity , and extent of the blast ; the post-explosion radiations on the ground and in the air ; meteorological observations ; and a host of other phenomena that took five typewritten pages to enumerate . The studies were devised to make the bomb tell its story before , during , and after the detonation . For this purpose scores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devices , old and new , were placed in concrete pillboxes and underground shelters over a radius of many miles . These included a number of high-speed cameras of all types , numerous electronic devices , supersonic detectors , all sorts of instruments for probing inside the infinitesimal world of the atom 's nucleus , devices to measure the intensity of the blast , radiation meters , and a host of other special equipment . It required about 500 miles of wiring to connect the various electrically operated instruments in the bombproof shelters several miles away with the site of the gadget . Seismographs were placed at various distances to measure the effects of the atomic explosion underground , and specially equipped 13-29 Superfortresses went aloft to study the effects iu the upper atmosphere . More than 300 scientists , including a number of Nobel prize winners , were involved in the test . About 250 military personnel were engaged in carrying out the security and protective measures . A providential warning that came a few days before the test led to hasty last-minute changes designed to prevent a possible catastrophe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explosives , but otherwise an exact duplicate of the atomic gadget , had been set up on the tower as a practice model . A thunderstorm came along and touched it off . This led to protective measures against the possibility that a bolt of lightning  | might set off the first atomic explosion on earth , possibly at a time when the scientists were still in its vicinity . The northwestern section of the 2,000-square-mile Alamogordo Air Base was chosen as the test site because of its remoteness from large towns , isolation , inaccessibility , and desirable meteorological characteristics . The nearest inhabited locality is the village of Carrizozo , population 1,500 , about thirty air-line miles due east from the spot selected for the test . Other communities in the locality are Socorro , population 3,500 , about thirty miles to the northwest , and Alamogordo , fifty miles to the southeast . The nearest large city is Albuquerque , about 125 miles to the northwest . Everything relating to the gadget ? the spot where it stood on its tower , the time scheduled for its blow-off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasion ? were referred to as Zero , the code name for the test . For everyone concerned , Zero became the center of the universe . Time and space began and ended at Zero . All life centered on Zero . Everyone thought only of Zero and the zero hour , or rather the zero microsecond . The transfer of the gadget over a distance of more than two hundred miles from Los Alamos to Zero presented a major problem , involving both security and safety . The transportation of this precious staff , possessing a value inestimable in terms of worldly considerations , : was in charge of the Military Intelligence branch at Los Alamos , headed by Captain Thomas O. Jones , formerly a Chicago lawyer . Several units of the complicated assembly left Los Alamos on Thursday morning , July 12 , 1945 , in a convoy accompanied by armed guards and several scientists , and arrived at its destination that same afternoon . Another convoy left Los Alamos at 12.01 Friday morning , July 13 , arriving at Zero nine hours later . Professors Bather and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principal units of the gadget . Tests by the score were carried out to make certain that every part functioned properly . A week earlier a group of leading radiologists under the direction of Colonel Warren had begun setting up a network of radiological stations at various distances to measure the radiation effects of the explosion . Final assembly of the bomb began on the night of July 12 , in an old ranch house . Specialty teams , composed of the top men on specific aspects of science , all of which were bound up in the whole , took over their specialized parts of the assembly . In each group was centralized months and even years of channelized endeavor . As various component assemblies arrived from distant points , tension among the scientists rose to an increasing pitch . Failure was an ever present possibility . They also knew that one false move would blast them and their entire effort into eternity . And a few were also haunted by the specter of too great a success . Dr. Bather was the man charged with the assembly of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important section , after insertion , apparently became tightly wedged and would go no farther . Dr. Bacher , however , was undismayed , and reassured the group that time would solve the problem . After three minutes , which seemed an eternity , the entire unit , which had been machine-tooled to the finest measurement , gradually slid down to its place and the basic assembly was completed without further incident . On Saturday , July 14 , the unit was elevated to the top of the steel tower . All that day and the next the job of preparation went on , amid lightning flashes and peals of thunder . In addition to the apparatus necessary to cause the detonation , complete instrumentation to  | determine the " pulse-beat " and all reactions of the bomb was rigged on the tower . The last men to inspect the tower with its cosmic bomb were Dr. Bainbridge , Dr. Kistiakowsky and Lieutenant Howard C. Bush , of Brooklyn , N. Y. , who was in charge of the Military Police Detachment . These three stood watch on top of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their silhouettes outlined at intervals by a flash of lightning . If they thought of the dummy bomb that had been touched off by lightning on the same tower a few days before , they showed no signs of it . They looked very lonely up there , ever so small , yet ever so big , man against the gods . Before the explosion there had been anxiety on the part of some of those present lest an uncontrollable chain reaction might be started in the atmosphere , though this was contrary to all the known facts about the energies latent in the active substance . One of the younger scientists was so unnerved that , on the advice of the medical men , he was removed from the scene . There is a story current among the physicists that one of the high-ranking military officials , growing more and more tense as he watched the ball of fire expand at a terrific rate , was heard to exclaim : " My God , the long-hairs have lost control ! " Darkening heavens poured forth rain and lightning right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aerial observation of the test . Many of Dr. Oppenheimer 's assistants were disturbed by the conditions , and some even urged that the test , scheduled for four o'clock , be called off altogether for that night . General Groves and Dr. Oppenheimer kept going out of the control house into the darkness to look at the sky , constantly assuring each other that the one or two visible stars were becoming brighter .  | " I attempted to shield him , " General Groves said , " from the evident concern shown by many of his assistants , who were disturbed by the uncertain weather conditions . By three thirty we decided that we could probably fire at five thirty . By four the rain had stopped , but the sky was heavily overcast . Our decision became firmer as time went on . " Outside Carrizozo a large motorcade of Army trucks and personnel stood waiting . Had the wind suddenly shifted in the direction of that little Spanish-American town , thus threatening to carry the radioactive cloud that way , the men in the motorcade stood ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inhabitants , by force if necessary , to a place of safety . While the blast undoubtedly aroused the sleeping citizens of Carrizozo , they never knew what further surprise would have come their way if there had been a change in the wind . As the zero hour for the explosion approached , tension in the control room at S-10,000 reached a tremendous pitch . The several observation points in the area were tied in to the control room by radio , and , with twenty minutes to go , 1 ) r . Allison of Chicago University , assistant director at Los Alamos , took over the radio set and made periodic time announcements . The time signals , " minus twenty minutes , minus fifteen minutes , " and so on and on , increased the tension to the breaking-point . The last few seconds were described by General Farrell as much worse than any lie had experienced during zero hour in the front-line trenches in World War I. Dr. Conant said he had never imagined seconds could be so long . In a report to the War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seconds before zero , and the eternal moments that followed :  | As the time interval grew smaller and changed from minutes to seconds , the tension increased by leaps and bounds . Everyone in that room knew the awful potentialities of the thing that they thought was about to happen . The scientists felt that their figuring must be right and that the bomb had to go off but there was in everyone 's mind a strong measure of doubt . The feeling of many could be expressed by " Lord , I believe ; help Thou mine unbelief . " We were reaching into the unknown and we did not know what might come of it . It can safely be said that most of those present were praying and praying harder than they had ever prayed before . If the shot were successful , it was a justification of the several years of intensive effort of tens of thousands of people ? statesmen , scientists , engineers , manufacturers , soldiers , and many others in every walk of life . In that brief instant in the remote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and brawn of all these people came suddenly and startlingly to the fullest fruition . Dr. Oppenheimer , upon whom had rested a very heavy burden , grew tenser as the last seconds ticked off . He scarcely breathed . IIe held on to a post to steady himself . For the last few seconds he stared directly ahead , and then when the announcer shouted " Now ! " and there came this tremendous burst of light followed shortly thereafter by the deep growling roar of the explosion , his face relaxed into an expression of tremendous relief . Several of the observers standing back of the shelter to watch the lighting effects were knocked flat by the blast . The tension in the room let up and all started congratulating each other . Everyone sensed " This is it ! " No matter what might happen now all knew that the impossible scientific job had been done . Atomic fission would no longer be hidden in the cloisters of the theoretical physicists ' dreams . It was almost full grown at birth . It was a great new force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a feeling in that shelter that those concerned with its nativity should dedicate their lives to the mission that it would always be used for good and never for evil . Dr. Conant reached over and shook hands with General Groves . Dr. Bush , who was on the other side of the General , did likewise . Dr. Kistiakowsky threw his anus around Dr. Oppenheimer and embraced him with shouts of glee . Others were equally enthusiastic . All the pent-up emotions were released in  | those few minutes and all seemed to sense immediately that the explosion had far exceeded the most optimistic expectations and wildest hopes of the scientists ... . As to the present war , there was a feeling that no matter what else might happen , we now had the means to insure its speedy conclusion and save thousands of American lives . As to the future , there had been brought into being something big and something new that would prove to be immeasurably more important than the discovery of electricity or any of the other great discoveries which have so affected our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magnificent , beautiful , stupendous and terrifying . No man-made phenomenon of such tremendous power had ever occurred before . The lighting effects beggared description . The whole country was lighted by a searching light with the intensity many times that of the midday sun . It was golden , purple , violet , gray and blue . It lighted every peak , crevasse and ridge of the near-by mountain range with a clarity and beauty that can not be described but must be seen to be imagined . It was that beauty the great poets dream about but describe most poorly and inadequately . Thirty seconds after the explosion , came , first , the air blast , pressing hard against the people and things ; to be followed almost immediately by the strong , sustained , awesome roar which warned of doomsday and made us feel that we puny things were blasphemous to dare tamper with the forces heretofore reserved to the Almighty . Words arc inadequate tools for the job of acquainting those not present with the physical , mental and psychological effects . It had to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Monsanto Chemical Company , the cloud " resembled a giant brain the convolutions of which were constantly changing . " Only the future will tell whether it symbolized the collective brain that created it or the ultimate explosion of man 's collective mind . The flash lighted up the sky at Albuquerque and was seen as far as Amarillo , Texas , 450 miles east of Zero . At El Paso , 150 miles to the south , persons saw the flash and heard the blast and two successive echoes . Residents  | of Silver City , New Mexico , 200 miles to the southwest , and at Gallup , New Mexico , 235 miles to the northwest , reported that their windows rattled , and those at Gallup stated that they had also heard two explosions . Various reports from a number of other localities listed the explosion as an earthquake , a meteor , or an airplane crash . Members of the crew and passengers aboard a Santa Fe railroad train near Mountainair , about seventy miles to the northeast , thought they saw a bomber explode and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dared venture near the spot where Zero vanished in a great cloud of atomic fire were a crew of scientists in two Sherman tanks , the insides of which were lined with lead . In one of these was Dr. Fermi . They took samples of the earth by means of special scoops manipulated from the inside and made preliminary observations of the site , which , later examination revealed , was depressed over a radius of 400 yards to a depth ranging from ten feet at the periphery to twenty-five feet in the center . A subsequent examination of the ground revealed that all life , vegetable as well as animal , was destroyed within a radius of about a mile . There was not a rattlesnake left in the region , nor a blade of grass . The sand within a radius of four hundred yards was transformed into a glasslike substance the color of green jade . A steel rigging tower weighing thirty-two tons , at a distance of eight hundred yards , was turned into a twisted mass of wreckage . The tower at Zero was completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several miles away had vanished completely . It is believed that they started on a mad dash that ended in the wilds of Mexico . A number of cows at a similar distance developed graying spots on their skins .  | IN Atomland-on-Mars a man had to go at a pace " twice as fast as he could just to stand still . " Events did not occur in sequence , but simultaneously in all places . It had to be taken for granted that things would work as expected , at a time when no one could tell for certain that they would . Instead of taking one step at a time in logical sequence , many steps had to be taken simultaneously all over the map , relying on faith that in the end everything would fit into one grand design . Hence , long before the test at New Mexico , extensive preparations were made for getting the atomic bomb in action against Japan as soon after the test as possible . This entailed the training of special crews to carry the new weapon to the enemy ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed for greater speed , safety , and other requirements ; and the preparation of an advance base on Tinian Island , in the Marianas , as a final assembly place for the bomb , since Tinian was at that time ( Iwo Jima and Okinawa had not yet been taken ) the nearest point of departure for the land of the enemy . A highly secret base for the training of the special crews was established at the flying field at Wendover , Utah , in the fall of 1944 . Here , under Colonel Paul W.  | Tibbets , Jr. , of Miami , Florida , one of our most distinguished fliers , was organized what later became known as the 509th Composite Group , of the 313th Wing , of the 21st Bombing Command , of the 20th Air Force . He gathered under him seventy-five of the most daring fliers in our Air Force , and an equal number of picked non-commissioned officers and enlisted men , of whom sixty officers and seventy-five non-coms and G.I. 's were to constitute fifteen crews of nine men each , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large ground crew of 1,700 men , all highly skilled in the handling of B-29 's , was selected , after a most rigorous screening process , from our far-flung air contingents at home and on the various battlefronts . With the exception of Colonel Tibbets , no one among the officers or men had the slightest inkling of the nature of their job . All of them had been asked to volunteer for an organization that was " going to do something different . " That was all . They trained through the winter of 1944-5 and the spring of 1945 , on the flying field in the bleak Utah desert , in such strict secrecy that their existence was not known even among the top-ranking officers and scientists on the other sites of the Atomic Bomb Project . Since the effectiveness of the bomb was wholly unknown at the time , it was decided from the very beginning not to employ radar , but to drop the bomb visually over the chosen target . Also , it was believed necessary that the bomb be dropped as close to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequently , had to be chosen for their special ability to drop a bomb right on the button . In Utah they were given further training to enhance this ability . To simulate combat conditions , and to accustom the fliers to the " something different " they were to carry ,  | an exact model of the atomic bomb ( which , by the way , was not yet in existence ) , made of ordinary explosives but having the same weight and shape , was carried on the training flights and dropped over selected targets in the Utah desert from the same altitude from which the real thing was to be dropped later over Japan . Colonel Tibbets , a perfectionist if there ever was one , trained his men to take off and arrive at a given destination exactly on scheduled time . If a B-29 arrived five minutes late after a long flight , Colonel Tibbets was displeased . ' While this was going on in the Utah desert , construction was being rushed on the Atomic Bomb Base on Tinian , under the direction of Oklahoma-born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one of the ablest construction experts in the Army Corps of Engineers . Tinian was chosen not only because of its proximity to Japan , but also because it lent itself better than Saipan or Guam to the maintenance of strict secrecy . New Yorkers like myself found themselves at home on Tinian . Its roads and its streets were laid out ( doubtless by some homesick Seabee from New York ) along the lines of Manhattan Island , with numbered broad avenues running north and south , and numbered crosstown streets east and west . The small atom-town of twenty-one raised tents , where I lived with the atomic bomb scientists during my month 's stay at Tinian , was located somewhere in the vicinity of " Times Square . " The flying field from which the B-29 's took off for Hiroshima and Nagasaki was located somewhere in " upper Manhattan . " " Broadway " and " Eighth Avenue " were the two main thoroughfares , along which at all hours of the day and night the atomic bombers rumbled in jeeps and trucks to and from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Senate Corn- mittee , " Tinian is a miracle . " Here , 6,000 miles from San Francisco , the United States armed forces have built the largest airport in the world . A great coral ridge was half-leveled to fill a rough plain , and to build six excellent ten-lane runways , each almost two miles long . Beside these runways stood in long rows the great silvery airplanes , not by the dozen , but by the hundred . From the air this island , smaller than Manhattan , " looked like a giant aircraft carrier , its deck loaded with bombers . " Dr. Morrison 's description of what went on every day at Tinian is so graphic that I take the liberty to quote some of it : I doubt that there is a more complex and wonderful machine in the world than the B-29 . And here at Tinian , far from the factories in Seattle and Wichita , were several hundred of these million-dollar craft . Here were collected tens of thousands of specialists trained in the operation and repair of the delicate mechanisms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harbor every day rode tankers , laden with thousands of tons of aviation gasoline . A net of pipe lines supplied the airfields with fuel . The radio dial was busy with signals of every kind . And all these gigantic preparations had a grand and terrible outcome . At sunset some day the field would be loud with the roar of the motors . Down the great runways would roll the huge planes , seeming to move slowly because of their size , but far outspeeding the occasional racing jeep . One after another each runway would launch its planes . Once every fifteen seconds another B-29 would become air-borne . For an hour and a half this would continue with precision and order . The sun would go below the sea , and the last planes could still be seen in the distance , with running lights still on . Often a plane would fail to make the take-off , and go skimming horribly into the sea , or into the beach to burn like a huge torch . We came often to sit on top of the coral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in real awe . Most of the planes would return the next morning , standing in long single line , like  | beads on a chain , from just overhead to the horizon . You could see ten or twelve planes at a time , spaced a couple of miles apart . As fast as the near plane would land , another would appear at the edge of the sky . There were always the same number of planes in sight . The empty field would fill up , and in an hour or two all the planes would have come in . This was the environment in which the first atomic bomb base was set up . It was an island within an island . The inhabitants of the inner island lived in a world apart , completely isolated from the other contingents . In all , including military and civilian personnel , they numbered fewer than 2,000 , of whom 1,850 were aviation personnel . The others included twenty-seven civilian scientists , eleven Navy officers , nine Army officers , twenty-one enlisted men , all but three of whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the island , far removed from all other activities and closely guarded by special detachments of M.P . ' s , were several Quonset huts transformed into testing laboratories , and one barricaded , air-conditioned building . Aere the small group of scientists from Los Alamos , under the direction of Professor Norman F. Ramsey , of Columbia Ilnivcrsity , assembled the atomic bomb and prepared it for its final delivery . The stringent secrecy and the aloofness of the 509th Group subjected Colonel ' i ibbcts and his crew to considerable ribbing , and life ( luring the months prior to Hiroshima , already tense , was not made any easier by the ridicule of fellow fliers , including old comrades on other battlefields . It was made even more difficult by the fact that the members of the 509th did not themselves know what their mission was to be . Every day they would watch thousands of their comrades take off on missions to the Empire ( as the Japanese main islands were known ) in huge formations , many of them failing to return , many  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to take off now and then in a small formation of three planes , drop a lone missile over enemy territory , and return to base , to face the derision of fliers in other groups . Of course , they did not know at the time that they were making practice runs with simulated atomic bombs over Japan for a dual purpose ? to give them further training , and to condition the Japanese to the sight of small formations of B-29 's that did comparatively little harm . Then the Japanese , it was reasoned correctly , would pay no attention to the real thing when the time came . What the other groups on Tinian thought of the 509th was expressed in verse by an anonymous satirist , widely quoted during July and the first days of August . It ran as follows : Into the air the secret rose , Where they 're going , nobody knows . Tomorrow they 'll return again , But we 'll never know where they 've been . Do n't ask us about results or such , Unless you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is sure of the score , The 509th is winning the war . When the other Groups are ready to go , We have a program of the whole damned show . And when Halsey 's Fifth shells Nippon 's shore , Why , shucks , we hear about it the day before . And MacArthur and Doolittle give out in advance . But with this new bunch we have n't a chance . We should have been home a month or more , For the 509th is winning the war . The title of this poem was " Nobody Knows . " To add to their discomfiture , the Japanese radio began poking fun at the 509th.  | And so the days , weeks , and months dragged on for Colonel Tibbets 's harassed crew . They were no picnic for Colonel Tibbets himself , even though he knew what it was about . For he also knew that everything depended on a certain test in New Mexico , which had not yet taken place . And even if the test were to succeed , that still would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for which he knew was drawing close . Success in this case did not mean just " something different . " It had to be something revolutionary or it would have to be regarded as a dismal failure . If before the New Mexico test things had been going at double time , they moved even faster after the event . The Potsdam Conference was then in session , and the first item on the agenda was to inform President Truman of what had taken place . The British Embassy in Washington sent a similar report to Prime Minister Churchill , and it is believed that both informed Premier Stalin . General Groves and General Farrell sat up nights writing these reports , got a fast little courier plane , and rushed them to Potsdam . These reports , as General Farrell said later , probably " hit the Potsdam conferees with an impact almost equal to that of the bomb itself upon those of us who had the opportunity of seeing it in New Mexico . " It was then decided to get the bomb into combat as rapidly as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in several planes to San Francisco and loaded on the ill-fated cruiser Indianapolis . It arrived in Tinian by the end of July . The last few batches of the active material left the plant on the afternoon of July 26 and were flown to Santa Fe . From there they were taken by truck to Kirtland Field , Albuquerque , where they were picked up by three B-29 's of the 509th Group from Wendover and flown to Mather Field at Sacramento , aerial port of em- barkation for B-29 's , arriving there on the morning of July 28 . Disaster almost overtook one of the three B-29 's , named the Laggin ' Dragon and commanded by Captain Edward M. Costello , West Point Class of 1943 , whose home is in Zillah , Washington . Just after he had taken off for Tinian , when the plane was only fifty feet up , the life-raft door blew open and wrapped itself around the right elevator . By that time the 11-29 had already crossed the end of the runway and started nosing toward the ground . Captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , started pulling the wheel back with all their strength to raise the elevator , but the big plane kept fluttering so violently that they had all they could do to hold on to the wheel . They finally managed to raise the whole weight of the raft upward and climbed to three hundred feet . Just then the raft became disengaged and blew off into the air . They signaled the control tower and were advised that if the plane could fly at all , they should remain in the air until their weight was down to 120,000 pounds , when it would be safe to make a landing . The plane at that time weighed 132,000 pounds , one ton heavier than the maximum limit allowed at Mather Field . Just then they began noticing a flutter in the tail , and the tail gunner , Corporal Maurice J. Clark , reported that large areas of the elevator fabric had been torn away and that more pieces seemed to be tearing off into the wind . Captain Costello therefore notified the tower that he was forced to come in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in addition to the crew of nine , and they were all told to get ready for a crash landing . But as they stood there in crash landing position , hands clasped behind their necks , expecting the worst ,  | Captain Costello made a perfect landing just when it seemed that the airplane was about to get out of control . The reversible pitch propellers with which the atomic bomb B-29 's were equipped had saved the day . It was not even necessary to use the brakes in landing . Captain Costello did not know what he was carrying , but he had an idea that it must be something precious if three B-29 's were required to carry it in three parts all the way to the Marianas . He was determined , he told ' me , to save the unit at all costs . The torn elevator was replaced with an elevator taken from a war-weary B-29 that had been on thirty missions , and they took off at 12.30 a.m. on July 30 . They arrived at Tinian at 12.15 p.m . August 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 , the bomb was loaded on the Enola Gay , Colonel Tibbets 's flagship . The Indianapolis was sunk with the loss of nearly all men aboard while on her way to the Philippines , four days after she had delivered her precious cargo to Tinian . By the end of July General Farrell , deputy to General Groves , arrived to take charge . On his way to Tinian he stopped off at Guam , where lie conferred with General Curtis E. LeMay , then in command of the 20th Air Force and about to become the Chief of Staff of the Strategic Forces , and arranged the details of the operation . He then called on Admiral Chester W. Nimitz , whose headquarters were also at Guam , and arranged with him for assistance by the Navy , which included the placing of submarines in Japanese waters along the route the atomic bomb fliers were to take , for the purpose of rescue in case they were forced to bail out or ditch , as well as having in readiness a number of Navy flying boats at near-by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called  | General Farrell over to the window and pointed at an island a short distance from Guam . " That island over there , " Admiral Nimitz said , " is Rota . There are about three thousand Japanese on it . They bother us a great deal . They have radios . They know what we are doing . They are sending out information . Have n't you got a small bomb you can drop on Rota ? I do n't feel it warrants an amphibious invasion at this time . But they do bother us . " " Unfortunately , Admiral , " General Farrell replied , " all our bombs are big ones . " Early on the morning of Sunday , August 5 , Marianas time ( Saturday , August 4 , in the United States ) , there came word that the weather would be favorable for a take-off early next morning . Preparations were at once speeded up to get the bomb ready for immediate loading . But Captain ( now Rear Admiral ) William S. Parsons , Navy Ordnance expert , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for decisions as to its use , was worried . The night before , he had seen four B-29 's in a row crash at the end of the runway and burn . " You know , " he said to General Farrell , " if we crack up at the end of the runway tomorrow morning and the plane gets on fire , there is the danger of an atomic explosion and we may lose this end of the island , if not the whole of Tinian with every blessed thing and person on it . " Said General Farrell : " We will just have to pray that it does n't happen . " " Well , " replied Captain Parsons , " if I made the final assembly of that bomb after we left the island , that could n't happen . " " As I understand it , if that is the way you would work  | it , then , if the plane cracks up and burns , we just lose the airplane and the bomb and the crew and you ? but we do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Farrell . " Yes , " said Captain Parsons . General Farrell said : " Is n't that nice ? Have you ever assembled a bomb like this before ? " " No , " said Captain Parsons , " but I 've got all day to try it . " " Go ahead and try , " said General Farrell . So Captain Parsons went ahead and began learning the intricacies of the bomb 's assembly some hours before take-off time . By afternoon he felt confident that he could do the job . He is a technician of a high order , Admiral Parsons , and a great gentleman . The bomb , only partly assembled ( though to all outward appearances it looked complete ) , was rolled out of its closely guarded , air-conditioned assembly building and taken to the airfield . By late afternoon it was hanging majestically in the bomb bay of the Enola Gay , named by Colonel Tibbets after his mother . It was autographed with all sorts of ribald messages to the Emperor , including one in bold letters from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just round the corner . There was a lump in every throat and a hope in every heart when the loading job was finally finished . I arrived in Tinian in the midst of the loading , three days behind schedule . I had been first delayed at Hamilton Field , California , waiting for a transport plane , and then lost another precious day when the C-54 that was taking me to Hickam Field , Hawaii , was forced to turn back after flying half the distance . I was traveling under sealed orders and did not know until I arrived at Guam on the morning of August 5 what my final destination was . At Guam I was met by First Lieutenant Nicholas  | Del Genio , of Military Intelligence and Security , who informed me that he was to take me to Tinian . Though I did not have official knowledge , I had a fairly good notion that I was to be privileged to be an eyewitness of the dropping of the first atomic bomb just as I had witnessed the first test in New Mexico . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I was given an official card bearing the legend : " Valid only if captured by the enemy , " and informing the enemy that I was entitled to the privileges of a colonel . As Dr. Alvarez , who carried the same kind of card , said : " I could just see myself coming down in a parachute , waving this card at the natives . " Immediately upon my arrival in Tinian I sought out General Farrell , hoping that there was still time to arrange for my going along . General Farrell , as fine a man as I have ever met , told me it was too late , but that I would go on the next mission , which at that time was scheduled for August 11 . " There may not be any need for another mission , " I said . " This one may do the trick . " " I hope you are right , " he said . That same evening at about ten o'clock six selected crews were assembled for briefing . The usual jesting that takes place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about to learn what the something different was for which they had undergone such intensive training and suffered the ridicule of their fellows . Colonel Tibbets took the platform in the barnlike newly built assembly hall , with its long rows of unpainted wooden benches , and addressed his men as follows : " Tonight is the night we have all been waiting for . Our long months of training are to be put to the test . We will soon know if we have been successful or failed . Upon our efforts tonight it is possible that history will  | be made . We are going on a mission to drop a bomb different from any you have ever seen or heard about . This bomb contains a destructive force equivalent to twenty thousand tons of TNT . " IIe paused , expecting questions . But there was silence in the room , a look of amazement and incredulity on every face . Colonel Tibbets resumed his talk : " Because this bomb is so powerful , we must use different tactics from those we have employed when using ordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part each plane was to play . Three airplanes would take off one hour early , at 1.45 a.m. the next morning . Those planes would act as weather reporters . It was their responsibility to cover three previously selected targets . This would provide the latest weather reports , so that at the proper time the target could be changed should weather conditions make it necessary . The second three B-29 's , one of which was to be the strike plane , to be piloted by Colonel Tibbets , would take off at 2.45 and assemble over Iwo Jima about fifteen minutes after daybreak . ' 1'I-is assembly was necessary because the three planes had to enter the target area together . At midnight there was another briefing , at which all the points were carefully gone over . The men still wore the amazed look of two hours before . They were told what had happened in New Mexico . They were each handed a pair of adjustable arc welders ' lenses and warned not to look at the flash with their naked eyes . But what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was concluded with a deeply moving  | prayer by the Chaplain , Captain William B. Downey , of the Hope Lutheran Church at Minneapolis : " Almighty Father , who wilt hear the prayers of them who love Thee , we pray Thee to be with those who brave the heights of Thy heavens and who carry the battle to our enemies . Guard and protect them , we pray Thee , as they fly their appointed rounds . May they , as well as we , know Thy strength and power , and armed with Thy might may they bring this war to a rapid end . We pray Thee that the end of war may cone soon , and that once more we may know peace on earth . " May the men who fly this night be kept safe in Thy care , and may they be returned safely to us . We shall go forward trusting in Thee , knowing we are in Thy care now and forever . Amen . " Quietly we filed out into the night and proceeded to the mess hall , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tennessee , not far from Oak Ridge , served the traditional pre-flight supper . Here was the menu , with Sergeant Easterly 's side re-marks : Look ! Real eggs ( " How da ya want them ? " ) Rolled oats ( " Why ? " ) Milk ( " No fishing " ) Sassage ( " We think it 's pork " ) Apple butter ( " Looks like axel grease " ) Butter ( " Yep , it 's out of again " ) Coffee ( " Saniflush " ) Bread ( " Someone get a toaster " ) . After supper we all went to the field and gathered around the Enola Gay . Batteries of glaring lights had been set up and hundreds of pictures were taken . There was some danger in that , as there were still many Japs hiding in the hills above the field and they
