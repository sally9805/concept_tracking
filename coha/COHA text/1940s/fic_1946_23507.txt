all the rooms , except Holden 's , opening drawers and closets . but he could n't find any . He did find some pillowcases . They were too small , and so he used two , one at each end of the pillow . He picked up his toilet kit and went into the bathroom . Holden had figured the baby out . He used a lot of hot water , washing and shaving leisurely . Tomorrow , there might be enough water for a bath . Holden called him as he left the bathroom . Holden had found a blue dressing-gown and a pair of bedroom slippers . He had put them on , though they were too large , and had lit a fresh cigar . " You old coot , " Burke said . Holden swore at him . " You do n't have a heat-up old jug of bourbon around ?

He was very tired by now , but he lay awake for some time . " There is no use kidding myself , " he thought finally . " All the comforts of home , but somebody else 's home . " And yet , as Holden had said , the bastards had asked for it . No doubt about that , they had asked for it . Or one could be more articulate . He framed a statement : " For us , Herr Braun , this is a military necessity . For you it is an act of biblical retribution . " He shifted a little , enjoying the compliant comfort of the mattress . And yet , suppose that , in spite of this , one felt uneasy , guilty of violent intrusion , and even , in a way , criminally intimate with the enemy . . . Suddenly he knew that he was trapped .

" We ought to wreck this place when we leave it , break the windows , slit the mattresses , smash the furniture . . . . " He heard Holden 's querulous voice in the hall . " God damn you , Burke , " Holden was saying , " you left the light on in the bathroom . " III . Past the Age for Folly WILLIAM ARTHUR BREYFOGLE ur you 're in luck ! " Atkinson told me . " This voyage , we 're off for the West Coast , and it 's the first time they 've let us go past the Gulf . Captain Hunt 's very pleased . " Atkinson was second officer of the Mary Kelly , and I had just come aboard as purser . I was trying to look as if I belonged there . In the journeyman stage ofmy career , I had once worked for a shipping company and made a few voyages as supercargo , the better to fit me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ briefly when he was young , but for thirty years he had been a lawyer in Boston . Atkinson and I kept each other in countenance . Strictly speaking , we had no business to be going to sea again . And vet- - Yon know how it is . You feel that you ought to be doing something appropriate to wartime , you make inquiries here and there , and you begin to resent it when the authorities keep asking how old you are . They are very shy of middle-aged fellows with romantic ideas , and you find small choice of jobs . But the impulses of middle age can be just as irresponsible , and as irresistible , as those of adolescence . You keep on trying and at last , after many rebuffs and much indignation , you sign as a member of the crew of the Mary Kelly . Atkinson hastened to assure me that there was nothing wrong with the ship , nothing wrong with her at all . He spoke on a note of challenge , and I guessed that his first good look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine . The Mary Kelly was nearly fifty years old , a slow , small coal-burner . I found out later that she owed her survival , her escape from the wreckers , to a long and involved process of litigation turning on the question of her ownership . While the lawyers were at it , the old ship had led a life of pampered ease  --  laid up at a wharf somewhere , her machinery kept smeared with grease and her paint touched up now and then . The war , with its need for anything and everything that would float , had brought her back into service . Her low speed barred her from the Atlantic convoys but beyond that , Atkinson insisted , there was nothing wrong with her . She was a good ship ; it did n't matter what ignorant people said about her . That was a sore point with us all , from Captain Hunt down . The seamen from the new freighters docked near us in Philadelphia called the Mary Kelly " Grandma , " and they used to shout derisive comments to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A good ship , " Captain Hunt would say in his deliberate manner , when the taunts became more disrespectful than usual . " When she was built , they did n't turn them out by the hundreds and thousands . If they had , she vould n't be afloat today . " The Captain thought the world of her . He was as blind to her imperfections as any lover to those of his lady , and he had that simplicity and singleness of devotion that persuade you , against your ownbetter judgment . A reflection upon his ship was the only thing that irritated him . The inevitable hitches , delays , and minor emergencies of war time shipping had no power to disturb him , and he was quite willing to admit , when questioned , that he himself was past the usual age for active command . ( He was seventy-one , and admitted being sixty-six . ) But if you were wise , you would not mention the Mary Kelly in his hearing except to praise her . Atkinson confided to me that there were times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that particular kind of innocence he has . What he believes , he believes all over , without any doubts or reservations . Lord , it 's terrifying ! I 'd forgotten that there were still people Iike that . " " Did he have as hard a time as we had , getting to sea again ? " " I think so , though he never mentions it . You know , he is n't good at deceiving anyone . He gives himself away . You 've noticed that tune he whistles when he thinks nobody 's around ? It 's always the same tune ? ' The Blue Alsatian Mountains . ' Fifty years ago it was very popular , and that 's when Captain Hunt first heard it , and liked it , and remembered it . It 's quite in keeping for him to stick to one tune all those years and never see how it dates him . " Atkinson shook his head . " At first I wanted to take him in hand , teach him a few tricks . But then I saw that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't want him changed , anyway . He 's unique , Captain Hunt is  --  a collector 's item . " M Y OWN dealings with the Captain fully confirmed what Atkinson had told me . We got away from Philadelphia and stood off for the south , and Captain Hunt paced up and down the bridge and whistled " The Blue Alsatian Mountains " while the old ship plodded sedately along . At sea , with no one to shout rude remarks , we could forget that she was old . The pleasant corollary to forgetting that she was old was to pretend that we ourselves were young again , in a world in which sturdy little coal-burners were the last word in ocean transport . This was the feeling we had wanted to recapture , and for a time we were free to revel in it . When I met Atkinson on deck , he would grin and wag his head at me . " Great , is n't it ? " Atkinson would say . We had our grumblers , of course . The first mate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officer , and he was anxious to tell everyone that if the papers had come a week sooner he might have had a job on a Liberty ship . But Halloran was only twenty-three , and we found that we could squelch him by invoking our superior age , experience , and wisdom . We had a much harder time with Fraser , the chief engineer . He was a man of our own age , lie strenuously denied our right to an opinion on anything below decks , and he maintained that the Mary Kelly 's machinery belonged in a museum , if not on a scrap-heap . " You would n't be singing her praises , either , if you had to do it in the stoke-hold , " he told us sourly . " I 've some desire to live out my natural span , and I ca n't manage that by breathing the dust of coal that 's half-sulphur and half-slate . You can be poetic about the old ruin if you like , but all the poetry in the world wo n't get that reek out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We did our best , but in the end we simply had to ignore Fraser . He was a man quite without sentiment . " What 's old deserves respect , " he would say . " But what 's long dead ought to be buried , even if it can still move around . " Atkinson and I ignored him . Until we reached the West Coast port of our destination , we had a thoroughly good time . B ur in port everything was suddenly and sharply different . We came in a day late , and the dock reserved for us had been taken by one of the newest of the new freighters , the Grant Southam . We protested , but the port authorities ruled against us . Her cargo had a much higher priority than ours . The best they could do , after keeping us waiting another two days , was to move us into the next slip , where the Grant Southam and her crew looked down upon us in fact as well as figuratively . Fraser wanted to know what else we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were worse than in Philadelphia . Ashore , the Mary Kelly 's crew got into fights with the Grant &wham's,; to make the feeling between the two ships even worse . It might have been only a natural desire to reduce turnaround time , but it did seem to us that that new freighter had an arrogant way about her . We were short-handed , and we had to watch two seamen promised us sent aboard the Grant Southam instead . The supplies we waited for , she got promptly -- -and the services of longshoremen , of port officials , and of tugboats . Then , just as they were turning her round , ready for the voyage out , a freak of current or some clumsiness on the part of a towboat-captain let the Grant Southam swing down too far toward us , and our blunt , over-hanging stern prodded her hard amid-ships . To hear them , you would have thought it was our fault , though we were docked and motionless , with steam up only in the venerable donkey-engine . Their captain , a man named McCann , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fist down at us . " Highly satisfactory ! " said Atkinson , on the broad grin . " He 's got a couple of dented plates to remember us by , and from the sound of it , we may have broken some of his crockery , too . Teach him not to hurry . And now maybe the local landlubbers can spare a little time for us . " We discharged one cargo , and took on another . We filled our bunkers with coal , covering the whole ship with choking black dust . We got the hatches back on and got steam up , and the tugs turned us around and let us go . Now we could draw a free breath again . The Grant Southam had to call at San Francisco on her way home , but for 114 there were no calls all the way to Philadelphia , nothing to mar the happy prospect of having our part of the sea to ourselves . The Mary Kelly was past the age for folly , too ; you could count on her to behave herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning out of that West I Coast port , one of the watch reported that he smelled smoke . Captain Hunt told Atkinson and the bosun to go and find out where it was coming from . It was a damp , windless day , of the kind you get in those waters , and my own idea was that it was the low-hanging smoke from the funnel we smelled . Certainly you could smell it everywhere . It made even the stokers cough when they came up on deck for a breath of air . It hung over the whole ship like a malediction , but a malediction with enough physical reality to make our eyes smart and our throats tickle . By noon 1 had developed a thumping headache . And by noon the Captain himself had come down to aid in the hunt . He talked to Atkinson for a few minutes , then said , " It must be in the bunkers . Get the hoses attached , and then take the hatch-cover off there . Careful with that job , too ; I 've known them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hoses ? Knock the wedges out then . Well have a look . " It was such a look as 1 hope f shall never have again . The carpenter took his maul and began tapping at the thin ends of the wedges . He got them loosened along the first side and had just begun on the second when the whole hatch-cover lifted suddenly , as if what was underneath could put up with our dawdling no longer . The cover split noisily , and we scattered as the planks crashed back on the deck . The whole mouth of the hatch spewed up clouds of gray-yellow smoke that stank horribly . I heard the Captain shouting to . he hose-crews . But al first their efforts seemed only to make it worse . Where the streams struck , the smoke had steam in it now , and a prodigious hissing and crackling came up from below . A choking cloud enveloped us , and I had begun to fancy that the deck was straining under my feet . But the Captain turned away as if satisfied . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , Mr. Atkinson , " he said calmly . " If you want me , I 'll be on the bridge . " I have never thought of myself as exceptionally excitable , but composure like that is quite beyond me. in a way , it was easier for Atkinson , who had something to do . Atkinson did not spare himself . He went at the hard task as if a fire at sea had been his specialty and his delight . It seemed to me an inappropriate time to stand on the dignity of my rank , and gave the carpenter a hand . Between us , we gut the ruins of the hatch-cover moved out of the way . Those planks were still hot to the touch . DICIRESS to remark that , all my adult I life , I have been an avid reader of sea-stories . At second hand , I think I am familiar with most of the calamities possible aboard a ship . Now , the advantage the reader enjoys over the participant is so obvious that it may have escaped general notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plight . If it is intolerable , he may put the book down ; if it is merely alarming , he may read on to the end . In either case , he is soon out of his fix . But we were in ours for we did not know how long , and we could not flip over a few pages and see how it turned out . Atkinson and I had gone to sea again with some nonsense in our heads about recapturing our youth , having adventures , and this was what came of it ! This was an adventure  --  not mermaids or buried treasure , but the hot , choking , authentic thing . This was what we had come to find . Hours after the hatch-cover flew off , the smoke still poured in huge , stinking clouds from the hold . The fire stayed in its lair , as if waiting to spring out at us when we had spent our little strength . The pumps clanked away busily , the hoses writhed and twisted on the deck , but the best we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire had started at the very bottom of the bunkers , we might have contrived to drown it , but evidently it was burning about half-way down , where the streams from the hoses reached only as ineffectual , divided trickles . To try putting the hatch-cover back on in an attempt to smother the fire would be to risk blowing the ship . to smithereens , and there was no way I could think of to get at it from below . It seemed to me that we were the next thing to helpless . If I had been Captain Hunt , I should have ordered the ship abandoned . But apparently Captain Hunt had no such intention . Toward noon , he came down among us , remarking that the smoke seemed a little thinner now . " Partly that 's because it is n't confined any longer , of course . Still , . I do n't think it 's getting worse , at least . Keep the hoses playing on it . I 've been down to the stoke-hold , and it 's no hotter t4re than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bunkers . " He glanced at us . " The men look a little used up ; you 'd better have them relieved . Better knock off yourselves , too . Purser , what are you doing here ? " " Moral support , sir , mainly . " He smiled . " If I were you two , I should go and drink a bottle of beer apiece . Do n't worry , 1 ' 11 keep an eye on your fire . " " Lord ! " said Atkinson , when we were in his cabin . " To hear him , you 'd think we were burning leaves in a back yard . Either he is a very cool customer , or we are very , very green hands . " The beer tasted as all beer will taste in a better world than this , but it did not obscure my clear view of a most ugly situation . I said , " We are not very far from San Francisco . As I see it , the one chance to save the ship would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Would it be insubordination if I told the Captain so ? " Atkinson took a mighty gulp , and set his bottle down . " The choice is n't ours ; it 's the Captain 's , " he said . " It 's only fair to assume that he knows what he 's doing , though I should n't care to be in his boots just now . All that 's required of us is faith and patience , but he 's gut to exhibit a great deal more than those minor virtues . Have you finished your beer ? " had n't , but I did now . Atkinson looked down at his ruined apparel . " No use changing our clothes yet , " he said . " Come on ; let 's go and see what 's happened . " Nothing had happened . The participant in an adventure can not escape from it at will , and neither can he hurry it along . In my opinion , this waiting is the hardest thing demanded of men at sea , men at war , men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brace yourself for a crisis , and the crisis does not come . It loiters while you shift from one foot to the other , a prey to your own fears . If our fire were to belch skyward suddenly in one roaring flame , if the ship were to split apart and sink , at least it would be over . But the fire only went on threatening to do those things , and I thought the men holding the nozzles of the hoses looked a little bored . ' Captain Hunt had his hands in his jacket pockets . " It is n't delaying us , " he said , when we came up . " Fraser says the engine , roorn 's all right , and the only smokethey 're getting there is what blows down the ventilators . Now , if that fire had started in fuel-oil tanks , we should have been sky-high before now ! Had you gentlemen thought of that ? There 's no denying , though , that the ship 's going to be filthy before we 're done with this business . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " So the captain meant that we should hold our course and deal with the fire ourselves , thankful that it had not happened aboard one of those new- ( angled oil-burners ! He allowed for nothing worse than the hard work it would require to get the upper-works back to their proper spotlessness . The smoke went on rolling up as if it had not heard him . Captain Hunt went hack to the bridge , with that firm , unhurried step of his . We went back to fighting the fire . ry HERE is a sort of protective numbness I that comes over much-tried men , to keep them from sheer despair . You go on doing your hopeless job mechanically , without conceding its hopelessness . You lose track of time , and it no longer strikes you that your efforts are preposterous. plead this special kind of numbness as an excuse for not knowing where we were , except that we had been plodding southward for what seemed an eternity  --  as one of the seamen put it , " like a blooming incense-pot . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we no longer started in alarm when the fire played one of its tricks  --  a sudden , cavernous rumbling and sliding down in those nether regions , an unexplained blast of hot , clear air . We were intent upon our task , absurdly intent , and I still remember my sharp annoyance with young Halloran for plucking at my grimy sleeve . He wanted me at the rail , and he was offering me his binoculars . Halloran was wildly excited . My eyes were streaming from the smoke , and I could n't see at all clearly . " What is it ? " I demanded irritably . " Another ship , but what 's so wonderful about that ? She is n't even on fire . " " No , she 's aground , fast on a shoal ! And ca n't you make out the name ? She 's the Grant Southam ! " We had changed course a little , and were standing in toward her . . Atkinson joined us at the rail , wiping his hot face . " What now ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could make out the signals of distress the Grant Southam was flying , but when we ran up flags of our own , the smoke hid them . We edged in gingerly , and the Grant Southam hoisted a new set . " Can not read your flags , " she said . " Am lowering a boat . " Captain McCann stood in the bows of that boat , and Captain Hunt came down to the Mary Kelly 's rail , at the waist , to talk to him . " You 're on fire ! " McCann cried , without any preface . You might have thought lie had come only to tell us that . He pointed . " You 're on fire ! " " We 're still afloat , anyway , " said Captain Hunt drily . " What happened to you ? " " A sand-bar , The charts of these waters are at fault , I tell you . We 're stuck fast , and we lost our propeller , trying to back off . But , man , you 're afire ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back across with you ? We 'll tow you off . " " How can you ? Do n't you understand that . . ? " Captain Hunt banged his fist on the rail . " I 've told you I know all about that ! Do you want a tow , or do you want to stick where you are , as a monument to poor seamanship ? If a sea gets up and you start to pound , you 'll have more than a fire to worry about . Do you want a tow , I say ? " It was a fact that , as she lay , the Grant Southam was utterly helpless , and might easily break apart before any other aid than ours could reach her . Captain McCann stood with his mouth open , staring up as if fascinated at the huge , leisurely plume of smoke still rising from our bunkers . At last he said , and meekly , " I 'll take a line back with me , Captain . If you 'll drop the end of it down to us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line across and hauled the cable after it . Then we got way on the Mary Kelly , and the cable came up out of the water until it stretched taut and straight between the two vessels . We put our weight on the cable then , and presently the Grant Southam budged a few inches , hung fast for a moment , and moved again . We hauled the big new freighter off into deep water , and Captain Hunt ordered the ship stopped . " Wait until they come up alongside , " hesaid , " and then make fast . We 're going to borrow the use of their pumps . " Then  --  the only time in my acquaintance with him  --  he hesitated , and looked at us as if for sympathy in a predicament not to his liking nor of his making . " I do n't like asking for help ; I 'd rather deal with it alone . But we 've got this tow to think of . Perhaps , in a case like this . . " The thick pall of smoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gleefully that we should not be alone in having to scrub everything above waterline . But Captain McCann did not protest at this reeking , grimy proximity . He fell in with our request at once , and sent four lines of hose across his own decks and ours . After that , it did n't take long . In two hours the fire was out , only stinking and steaming like an evil memory . We took the Grant Southam in tow and turned back toward San Diego . She came along meekly ; she seemed a little afraid of us . C APTAIN HUNT Was whistling softly to himself when , freshly scrubbed , we came in for dinner that evening . He broke off when we appeared and bobbed his white head at us . He seemed very pleased . " Mr. Atkinson  --  and you , Purser  --  you 've done well , " he exclaimed . " I 'm proud to have you for shipmates . We 've saved the cargo and the ship , we have n't lost time  --  or we should n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tow we 've got  --  and , by the Lord , gentlemen , we 've kept our ship afloat and able to fend for herself ! I tell you , the finest compliment ever paid a crew was the look on McCann 's face when we offered to tow him off that sand-bar . I 've followed the sea a good many years , but I never . . . " He turned his head , and then we saw why dinner was delayed . The steward came bustling in with a big , silver wine-cooler , set a glass in front of each of us , and began loosening the wire twisted about the cork of the first bottle . Captain Hunt looked up at the ceiling as if he had had nothing to do with any of this , as if he had only been waiting for his dinner . His lips pursed a little , and he began whistling softly in the momentary silence . It was a tune I am not likely to forget ; it was " The Blue Alsatian Mountains . "    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
