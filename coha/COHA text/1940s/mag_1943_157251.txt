The tales told at war 's end will not all come from men in the fighting forces . Red Cross workers will also contribute their share . This week , as the Red Cross opened its $125,000,000 War Fund Drive , some of those tales began to drift home . <P> &gt; Twenty-eight-year-old Red Cross Field Director Thomas S. Montgomery could hardly miss being nicknamed " Tiny " - he stands 6 ft. 8 in. , weighs a whopping 275 Ib . Too oversized to enlist , he squeezed his bulk into a Red Cross uniform , soon became noted on Guadalcanal for his frontline chant : " Chewing gum , candy , popcorn , soda pop . What 'll you have , boys ? " Wandering about the jungle alone , Montgomery recently met a group of marines . Said he : " Are n't we pretty close to the front lines now , fellows ? " Said a marine : " Front lines , hell . They 're half a mile behind us . This is a patrol . " Says Tiny Montgomery : " I ducked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was glad to get back in one piece . " <P> &gt; Pretty Susan Tate used to live in Washington , D.C. Now she is attached to the Moresby Hospital in New Guinea , is used to being proposed to three times a week . Her job is less adventuresome than Montgomery's-to cheer the wounded , write letters home , fulfill odd requests . One request : to cable $65.50 worth of unbroken I love you I love you I love you 's to a soldier 's girl back in the States . <P> Belt of Kindness . Behind Tiny Montgomery and Susan Tate stands an organization that has put a belt of mercy around the world . In the last three years the Red Cross has distributed $63,000,000 worth of supplies in war-torn countries . To Great Britain have gone : hospital equipment , medical and surgical supplies , clothing for civilians bombed out of their homes ; to Russia : bandages , anti-gangrene serum , insulin ; to China : quinine , vitamin tablets , cracked wheat ; to France : clothing , flour , chocolate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear the full story of the work being done by the Red Cross among United Nations prisoners of war . All that may now be told is that shipments of food and small luxuries are getting through . In 1941 and 1942 the Red Cross forwarded $6,000,000 worth of supplies to United Nations prisoners and U.S. civilian internees . The standard package for prisoners : powdered milk , cheese , oleomargarine , corned beef , pork , liver pt , canned salmon , dried prunes , orange concentrate , biscuits , chocolate bars , sugar , Nescaf , cigarets . Also welcome : eight tons of insecticide . <P> Boxes of Blood . Most dramatic of all Red Cross activities is the collection and distribution of blood plasma . Out of the South Seas have come pictures of natives bringing up boxes of dried plasma to base hospitals . Out of every theater of war where U.S. troops have seen action have come the thanks of Army &; Navy doctors , the deeper thanks of men whose lives were saved . The Red Cross to date has furnished the Army &; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armed services : almost four times more .
