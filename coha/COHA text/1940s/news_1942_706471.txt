txt Nation-wide rationing of gasoline can not be put in effect before July 1 , it was indicated tonight by Donald M. Nelson , war production chief . Administration problems , Mr. Nelson said , precluded earlier extension of the Eastern restrictions . Mr. Nelson discussed the imminence of national gasoline curtailment at a press conference after the WPB had considered a plan for rationing of transportation submitted by Joseph B. Eastman , Director of the Office of Defense Transportation . It was not made clear whether Mr. Eastman or Leon Henderson , director of the Office of Price Administration , would administer the rationing of transportation , if and when it is put into effect . Mr. Henderson 's OPA . , has handled gasoline rationing in the Eastern States , while the ODT has jurisdiction over omnibuses . Eastern gas rationing , Mr. Nelson said , was designed primarily to meet a shortage of tankers and railroad tank cars , but nation-wide rationing would be intended primarily to conserve existing rubber tires . " Of course ; - the whole thing is a transportation question , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your passenger tires too fast you will throw the load on the buses and trains . That is why pleasure driving has now become , to my mind , just a waste of rubber . " Pipe Line Question Involved Mr. Nelson - said that a technical committee would be appointed by the WPB to discuss the whole problem , including the substitution of some non-strategic material for steel in the construction of pipe lines . There was no question , he said , of the construction of a North Florida pipe line since that involved merely relocation . President Roosevelt , earlier in the afternoon , had said at his press conference that if he had reasonable assurance that the pending appropriation for this pipe line would pass Congress he could advance money from his emergency fund to start work immediately . The President pointed out that wooden barges could carry oil along the- inland waterway to the Eastern States and thus release steel oil-carriers for the transportation of gasoline . Mr. Nelson elaborated on this with the explanation that steel barges now used to carry coal along the Ohio River @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be shipped in wooden vessels . Mr. Nelson said ? that since American civilization had made tires virtually an essential , money was no object when it came to re , placing or conserving them . The best way of conserving them , he said , seemed to be gas rationing . Davies Cites Rubber- Need This point was made even more emphatic by Ralph K. Davies , deputy petroleum coordinator , in a statement to the oil subcommittee of the House Committee on Interstate Commerce in the afternoon . If nation-wide gasoline rationing were put into effect , he said , " I do hope the public will understand the facts of the rubber position . In those districts where there is a plentiful - supply of gasoline ? and that is throughout the country except-for the Atlantic seaboard and the States of Oregon and Washington ? will recognize that gasoline is rationed for the purpose of conserving rubber . " Mr. Davies said that he could , not offer tangible reasons for an optimistic view of the future as far as oil was concerned . The needs of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War industries would be kept supplied with oil . As to the extent to which civilian requirements could be met he would not attempt a prophecy . " As far as we can foresee today , there is no way of avoiding considerable inconvenience and even some hardship for the petroleum consuming public , and rather severe economic difficulties for those engaged in all phases of the oil business , " he said . Mr. Davies said that the government had directed refiners to produce more fuel oil and less gasoline . There had been , however , in increase in the output of 100-octane aviation gasoline from existing plants alone of 50 per cent more than was thought possible a few months ago . The Deputy Coordinator told the committee that his office had renewed its application to the WPB for steel to construct a 24-inch pipe line from Longview , Texas , to Philadelphia to relieve the Eastern shortage . It is believed certain , however , that the.WPB again will reject it .                @ @ @ @ @
