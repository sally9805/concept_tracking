The papacy 's role in the eleventh century was dramatic , because of the conflict with the western emperors in which Gregory VII played so strong a part , and because of the preaching of the first great crusade at the end of the century ; but the work of other clerics was in many respects more constructive . The Ottos in the tenth century had revived the state as a going concern in feudal society ; but it was left for the clerics of the eleventh century , of whom Lanfranc was the chief , to create the mechanism by which it could function . Lanfranc , whose life extended through the greater part of the century , represents the piety of the age and also the ecclesiastical statesmanship which , in a period of feudal violence , was building the foundations for the later development of national monarchies , and was working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society .  | LANFRANC was born about two years after the death of Pope Silvester II . He was city-born and bred . His birthplace , Pavia , had been the capital of the Lombards and had continued to be important , though it did not rank with Venice , which in the first half of this century became a powerful city state ruled by a doge and dominating the northern Adriatic . The atmosphere in which Lanfranc grew up was that of the renewed urban activity which had been fostered by the Ottos . Pavia had a reputation for legal studies , and Lanfranc 's father , who was a judge , gave his son the best education available . Lanfranc may possibly have studied at the law school of Bologna as well as in Pavia . At any rate , he mastered both trivium and quadrivium and gained a reputation as a successful lawyer . On his father 's death he went to France and became a teacher at Avranches . Then he took monastic vows at Bec , where he opened a school to which students flocked from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ famous ; he was completely orthodox and warned his pupils against those who made of dialectics a tool for misrepresenting the Scriptures . There was a growing tendency among educated churchmen to use the dialectic method in discussions of doctrine . One subject of widespread interest was the nature of the bread and wine in the Eucharist : did they at the moment of consecration become the actual body and blood of Christ ? Gerbert had stressed the Augustinian principle that God gave man reason in order that he could learn the truth ; his position was similar to that of John Scotus Erigena . In the school that Gerbert 's pupil Fulbert had founded at Chartres the monk Berengar of Tours developed the idea that the body and  | blood of Christ were not in the sacred elements . Fulbert tried to dissuade him , but Berengar persisted ; he read Erigena 's De divisione Naturae and wrote a book on the subject of transubstantiation . Lanfranc was present at a synod held in I050 when Berengar was tried for his views . Berengar maintained that reason need not bow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great eloquence attacked both Berengar 's stand on reason and his views on the Eucharist . Berengar was condemned as a heretic and forced to commit his book to the flames . Erigena 's treatise , which had so long escaped attention , was condemned at the same time . Lanfranc wrote a confutation of Berengar in which he condemned the use of reason to oppose authority . When he became a prelate he eschewed the use of dialectic as dangerous , but he could not break his long habit of reasoning according to syllogism , and made some of his political decisions by that method of reaching a conclusion . While Lanfranc was leading the relatively quiet life of a teacher , important changes were taking place in the part of the world where he was to spend his later years . The successors of Alfred had been able to buy off the Vikings temporarily through the payment of tribute , collected by levying the Danegeld , the first direct tax in England . By the end of the tenth century , however , Sweyn , king of Denmark , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his son Cnut had to fight renewed resistance , but was finally chosen king and made England the capital of his great northern empire , which comprised Norway , Denmark , and England . A devout Christian , he travelled to Rome , paid his respects to the pope , and , as other rulers had done , used the church to civilize his people . ( The church of St. Clement Danes on the Strand in modern London occupies the site of the Danish church outside the walls . ) In their activities as traders , the Danes established new towns which became commercial centers . Cnut distributed to his jarls large tracts of land , earldoms which provided a new title ( earl ) for the English nobility . Local institutions he left unchanged ; the shire moot , where the bishop presided , aided by the ealdormen and the thanes , continued to administer justice according to ancient custom , on the basis of the evidence of the people concerned . The ancient custom of election of the king by the Witan , or body of wise men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was continued ? and the Witan  | usually showed its wisdom by choosing the candidate whose accession was most feasible . Across the Channel , the Northmen who had settled along the mouth of the Seine had adopted the language , customs , and law of the people there , and distinguished themselves as devout Christians , hardy warriors , astute statesmen . The Norman dukes brought feudalism in the duchy of Normandy into unusual order ; they divided the lands into knight 's fees , the amount of land that would support a single knight fully armed , and thus there could be no question of how many knights ' service was due from each vassal . While the king of France had to travel about as Charlemagne had done to consume the produce of his manors , his vassals of Normandy had arranged a system by which they received money payments . Reverent Christians , the Norman dukes yet maintained strict control of the church within their dominions . In fact it was partly as a result of the effort by Norman dukes to standardize and curb the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became the most famous of all Norman institutions after its fuller development in England following the Norman conquest , began to evolve . In Normandy the claims of the church went back to a period before the Viking settlement , and the bishops often asserted rights which conflicted with the interpretation of feudal jurisdiction by the Norman dukes . This was especially true in the matter of various public rights , such as the collection of tolls or market rights , which vassals frequently received along with the grant of a fief . The Norman dukes contended that the immunity of religious foundations did not include these profitable franchise privileges . In the course of controversies with clerics the dukes resorted to holding inquests , or " recognitions , " in which the testimony of " old and lawful men " in the community was taken , under oath , to determine the origin of disputed privileges . Originally used to determine the rights of bishops , this sworn inquest was applied to other ecclesiastics , and from application only to financial matters the custom spread to other problems . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordering an investigation to be held and judgment to be declared on the evidence of those best fitted to represent the collective knowledge of the community : hence the stress on " old and lawful men , " whose memories went farthest back toward the origin of practices in dis- pute , and whose reputations in the community lent confidence in their long experience . Out of this system the familiar modern jury of England and America developed , and although the jury has come to be regarded as the common citizens ' paladin against arbitrary governmental power , the original institution was a device to support the king 's power against the usurpations of his vassals . The duke of Normandy in Lanfranc 's time was William the Bastard , a stern , fierce , self-willed man of unusual capabilities who was a cousin of Edward the Confessor of England . Edward was the son of the English king whom Cnut had supplanted , for when Cnut died the Danish king 's sons were unable to maintain the power he had gained , and Earl Godwin , the most powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was half Norman in blood and all Norman in education and sympathies , and he promised Duke William the succession to the English throne . On Edward 's death , however , the Witan chose Harold , Earl Godwin 's son , as king , and Harold accepted despite the fact that he had sworn not to oppose William . As soon as Harold became king he was beset with difficulties ; the king of Norway attacked him in the north , and Duke William of Normandy prepared to attack from the south . William first submitted his case to Pope Alexander II . One of the pope 's most influential advisors was the monk Hildebrand , who knew the Normans well . William 's devout vassals were wont to go on pilgrimages to Jerusalem and on their way home they occasionally tarried in ports of southern Italy to take part in the constant forays and raids among Italians , Greeks , and Saracens . Several of these doughty Norman pilgrims received grants of land ; the most notable , Robert Guiscard , had been granted Sicily as a fief by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposed these Norman adventurers , came to realize their qualities , and he won the pope to a decision in William 's favor on the question of the English throne . The duke gathered an army of mounted adventurers , landed in England , and in the battle of Hastings ( Io66 ) defeated Harold 's foot-soldiers , who were weary from a hasty march southward after repulsing the Norwegians . The Witan , overawed by William 's army as it marched around London , hastily chose him king . It took him five years to establish his authority throughout the country , and he used his experience of conditions in France to modify English  | feudalism so that the crown had more control over the nobility than the French king was able to exercise over his subjects . He left other local institutions untouched , and in his census , Domesday Book , he used the old Frankish custom of gathering information by the testimony of neighbors . In the years before his English adventure William had reorganized and reformed the church in Normandy , putting into office able men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unwilling Lanfranc to become abbot of a monastery that was being established at Caen . In 1070 , again protesting , Lanfranc became archbishop of Canterbury , to supervise the reorganization of the English church . Normans were placed in the most important positions , and William used these men , as he did Lanfranc , in the government . One cardinal policy of churchmen in politics was to transfer cases concerning the clergy from the secular courts to ecclesiastical courts . William , probably through Lanfranc 's influence , agreed to this policy , which might well have resulted in a strengthening of the papal powers ; but William guarded against that possibility by laying down set principles regarding the reception and authority of papal legates in England . Lanfranc 's reluctance to accept the important posts William offered him was partly due to the fact that he represented an ancient tendency of the church to attract men out of the world into a life of study and contemplation . He struggled against being drawn into the movement strong rulers of the day were inaugurating to bring the church into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great contemporaries , on the other hand , struggled to bring the state into the service of the church under the leadership of the pope . Three years after Lanfranc became archbishop of Canterbury the monk Hildebrand , a small , pale , weakvoiced man with piercing eyes , became pope as Gregory VII . His years of apprenticeship as papal adviser had qualified him for the position and his remarkable abilities enabled him to carry through far-reaching reforms . He was fully convinced that the church was St. Augustine 's City of God , and that the pope as God 's vicar had supreme power over the princes of the earth . He demanded that William the Conqueror do homage for England as a fief of the Holy See , but when William refused Gregory did not press the matter . As we have seen , he had a wholesome respect for the Normans , and William 's position regarding ecclesiastical courts was definitely a  | step in the right direction . ' Gregory then turned toward the German kingdom , whose ruler was less strongly placed . After Otto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ king and crowned emperor for seven generations , and all carried on more or less successfully the Ottonian policies . As a means of Germanizing the Slays , Otto III 's immediate successor , Henry II , founded the archbishopric of Bamberg and built a magnificent church there . Conrad II conciliated the lesser nobility and replaced the clergy in government posts by laymen of mean origin . His son , Henry III , was recognized as overlord by the kings of Bohemia and Hungary , enforced the Cluniac reforms in Germany , and set out to reform the papacy . He deposed three popes and forced the election of several Germans trained in the schools that had been founded by Archbishop Bruno of Cologne . During the papacy of the third of these German-trained popes , Leo IX , a dispute over the claims of Byzantium to rule the church in southern Italy precipitated the final schism between the eastern and western churches . Henry III put down revolt with a strong hand ; but during the minority of his son Henry IV , who was a small child when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he reached manhood he found himself faced with sporadic revolts of his vassals . He was a man of great ability and unbounded ambition , but was inclined to hasty action . He practised simony in the expectation of drawing a large part of his revenues from the filling of church offices , whereupon the Cluniac reformers appealed to Gregory VII . Upon his election as pope , Hildebrand had made clear his intention to establish papal authority . In his Dictatus he asserted that the Roman church had never erred and could not err , that the pope was supreme judge , and that only he could call a general council , depose bishops , demand the homage of all rulers , and depose emperors . The German clergy had protested Hildebrand 's election , but Henry had given his assent , because at the time he was coping with a revolt in Saxony . A synod at Rome laid down drastic penalties for simony , marriage of the clergy , and lay investiture . It was in accordance with the spirit of an age in which symbolism was supreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the choice of bishops , forbade the symbolic act of investiture by the king with the ring and the staff of episcopal office .  | When called to account for failing to co-operate with the decrees of the Synod of Rome , Henry , who had just quelled the Saxon revolt , caused a German synod to declare that Gregory had been illegally elected , and demanded that he abdicate . Gregory declared Henry deposed and excommunicate , and freed the emperor 's subjects from their allegiance . The letters exchanged by the two dignitaries in the course of their quarrel are choice specimens of the vocabulary of vituperation . Gregory , appropriately , was the less violent ; he deposed Henry as " a rebel of incredible insolence , " but Henry summoned him : " Come down and relinquish the apostolic chair ? come down , come down , to be damned through all eternity . " The German princes , who had no love for the ambitious Henry , declared they would choose a new king unless he obtained absolution within four months . Henry , in danger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italy to make his peace with Gregory , and at Canossa waylaid the pope , who at the request of the German princes was traveling toward Germany to preside over a synod that would proceed against Henry . The pope was outplayed , and after keeping Henry waiting in suppliant guise three days , gave him absolution . In preventing Gregory from entering Germany Henry won the essential victory , and later in his reign he revenged himself , driving Gregory out of Rome and making a new pope . Gregory called the Normans of Apulia to his aid ; led by Robert Guiscard they attacked Rome , expelled Henry , and sacked the city . The scene at Canossa received little attention at the time , but later was used as an example of the power of the church where moral questions were concerned . Since Gregory ended his life in exile , the ascendancy of the popes remained still to be demonstrated , a fact which provided an incentive to his successors to preach the crusades . While this struggle was going on in Germany , William the Conqueror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Normans whom he could use as administrators , and made them responsible for military service for their lands . He left Normandy to his eldest son and the crown of England to his second son , William the Red . Lanfranc lived through two years of the reign of this brutal tyrant , who after the archbishop 's death kept the See of Canterbury vacant in order to enjoy its revenues . Lanfranc 's was a world struggling for order amid the disorders of feudalism . The conspicuous actors in this struggle towered above  | him as dramatic figures : Cnut , William I , the Emperor Henry IV , Pope Gregory VII . Each of these men in his own way strove to bring order out of disorder , but their work could not be completed without the services of educated and devoted men able to create an effective government . Lanfranc was such a man . He stood for order and authority in things of the mind as well as in politics , and gave no aid and comfort to the heretic . Ironically enough , however , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men who were to use that method to frame new heresies . The most important work done in his lifetime was William the Conqueror 's welding together of Norman and English institutions into an effective government , and in this he had an honorable part . The conflict over investitures waged between Henry IV and Gregory VII dramatized but did not end the conflict inherent in the clergy 's position of feudal lordship . Though Lanfranc solved his own problem admirably , rendering to Caesar the things he recognized as Caesar 's and unto God what he believed to be of God , it was a purely personal solution . The struggle for supremacy between church and state remained a crucial issue in European society .  | Here is made known in this writing , that a shire-moot sat at Aegelnoth 's stone , in the days of King Cnut . There sat Aethelstan , bishop , and Ranig , ealdorman , and Edwin , the ealdorman 's son , and Leofwine , Wulfsige 's son , and Thurkil White ; and Tofig Prud came there on the king 's errand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Leofwine of Frome and Godric of Stoke , and all the thanes in Herefordshire were there . Then came traveling there to the moot Edwin , Eanwen 's son , and there raised a claim against his own mother to a portion of land , namely , at Wellington and Coadley . Then asked the bishop , who would answer for his mother . Then answered Thurkil White and said that he would if he knew the claim . Since he did not know the claim , they deputed three thanes from the moot to where she was , which was at Fawley . These were Leof wine of Frome , and Aegelsig the Red , and Winsige Scaegthman . And when they came to her they asked what claim she had to the lands for which her son was suing . Then said she that she had no land that in any way belonged to him , and was bitterly angry with her son . Then she called to her Leoflaed , her kinswoman , Thurkil 's wife , and spoke to her as follows , before them all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom I give not only my land , but my gold , and garments , and robes , and all that I own , after my day . " And she then said to the thanes : " Do thanelike and well ; announce my errand to the moot before all the good men , and tell them to whom I have given my land and all my  | property ; and to my own son never anything , and bid them be witnesses of this . " And they then did so , rode to the moot , and declared to all the good men what she had laid upon them . Then Thurkil White stood up in the moot and prayed all the thanes to grant to his wife clean the lands which her kinswoman had given her , and they did so . And Thurkil then rode to St. Aethelbert 's monastery , with the leave and witness of all the folk , and caused it to be set in a Christ 's book . Normans and English , incited by different motives , have written of king @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extolling to the utmost both his good and his bad actions : while the latter , out of national hatred , have laden their conqueror with undeserved reproach . For my part , as the blood of either people flows in my veins , I shall steer a middle course : where I am certified of his good deeds , I shall openly proclaim them ; his bad conduct I shall touch upon lightly and sparingly , though not so as to conceal it ; so that neither shall my narrative be condemned as false , nor will I brand that man with ignominious censure , almost the whole of whose actions may reasonably be excused , if not commended ... . The Normans , that I may speak of them also , were at that time , and are even now , proudly apparelled , delicate in their food , but not excessive . They are a race inured to war , and can hardly live without it ; fierce in rushing against the enemy ; and where strength fails of success , ready to use stratagem , or to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live in large edifices with economy ; envy their equals ; wish to excel their superiors ; and plunder their subjects ,  | though they defend them from others ; they are faithful to their lords , though a slight offence renders them perfidious . They weigh treachery by its chance of success , and change their sentiments with money . They are , however , the kindest of nations , and they esteem strangers worthy of equal honour with themselves . They also intermarry with their vassals . They revived , by their arrival , the observances of religion , which were everywhere grown lifeless in England . You might see churches rise in every village , and monasteries in the towns and cities , built after a style unknown before ; you might behold the country flourishing with renovated rites ; so that each wealthy man accounted that day lost to him , which he had neglected to signalize by some magnificent action ... . William was humble to the servants of God ; affable to the obedient ; inexorable to the rebellious . He attended the offices of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able ; so that he daily was present at mass , and heard vespers and matins . He built one monastery in England , and another in Normandy ; that at Caen first , which he dedicated to St. Stephen , and endowed with suitable estates , and most magnificent presents . There he appointed Lanfranc , afterwards archbishop of Canterbury , abbat : a man worthy to be compared to the ancients , in knowledge , and in religion : of whom it may be truly said , " Cato the third is descended from heaven " ; so much had an heavenly savour tinctured his heart and tongue ; so much was the whole Western world excited to the knowledge of the liberal arts , by his learning ; and so earnestly did the monastic profession labour in the work of religion , either from his example , or authority . No sinister means profited a bishop in those days ; nor could an abbat procure advancement by purchase . He who had the best report for undeviating sanctity , was most honoured , and most esteemed both by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succeeded Lanfranc , of whom I have before spoken , who was , by the gift of God , as resplendent in England , As Lucifer , who bids the stars retire , Day 's rosy harbinger with purple fire ; so much did the monastic germ sprout by his care , so strongly grew the pontifical power while he survived . The king was observant of his advice in such wise , that he deemed it proper to concede whatever Lanfranc asserted ought to be done . At his instigation also was  | abolished the infamous custom of those ill-disposed people who used to sell their slaves into Ireland . The credit of this action , I know not exactly whether to attribute to Lanfranc , or to Wulstan bishop of Worcester ; who would scarcely have induced the king , reluctant from the profit it produced him , to this measure , had not Lanfranc commended it , and Wulstan , powerful from his sanctity of character , commanded it by episcopal authority ... . In the year of our Lord Jesus Christ 's incarnation 1072 , of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reign of William , glorious king of England , and duke of Normandy , the sixth ; by the command of the said pope Alexander , and permission of the same king , in presence of himself , his bishops , and abbats , the question was agitated concerning the primacy which Lanfranc , archbishop of Canterbury , claimed in right of his church , over that of York ; and concerning the ordination of certain bishops , of which it was not clearly evident , to whom they especially pertained ; and at length , after some time it was proved and shown by the distinct authority of various writings , that the church of York ought to be subject to that of Canterbury , and to be obedient to the appointments of its archbishop , as primate of all England , in all such matters as pertained to the Christian religion ... . In another place William cited Lanfranc 's answer to the claims of the Archbishop of York . It is a good example of his method of argument . The Archbishop of York is still known as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is " primate of all England . " * ... Lanfranc put an end to the discussion , meeting him with this most wary answer : " The view on which you rely needs substantiation in asserting that to Augustine alone was granted the submission of all the bishops of Britain , and even of those who had been consecrated by the Bishop of York . That would have been a very poor and trifling gift bestowed by the pope on his old friend , this new Englishman ; especially when the Archbishop of York consecrated none who should be subject to Augustine in his lifetime , as there was no bishop there at all . For indeed the blessed Paulinus , the first prelate of that same city , was sent there , not in the days of Augustine , but of Justus the fourth , archbishop of Canterbury . English history will prove what I say . Knowing this , the supreme  | pontiffs have confirmed to the successors of Augustine the submission of all the bishops of England , as the privileges recited show , embellishing the Gregorian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language , and following it up with generous liberality , the representatives of the same see and patrons of the same policy . Now they hold that all the Churches of the English should borrow the discipline of life from that place from whose fire they caught the flame of faith . For who knows not that the faith of Christ flowed from Kent to York and all the other Churches of England ? As for your assertion that St. Gregory could have confirmed , had he wished , to Augustine 's successors by word what he had granted to Augustine , it is quite true and beyond denial . But , pray , what prejudice does this give to the see of Canterbury ? I will put a parallel case : for when our Lord and Saviour said to St. Peter Thou art Peter , ' etc. , He could have added , had He wished , and this same power I grant to thy successors . ' As it is , the omission detracts nothing from the reverence due to Peter 's successors . Will you oppose these words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the consciences of all Christians that they should fear his successors , even when they threaten , no less than Peter himself , and should gladly acknowledge any kind favour they the successors bestow . And so the arrangement of all Church matters is then , and only then , authoritative , if approved by the judgment of Peter 's successors . What is the meaning of this but the power of Divine grace passed on through Jesus Christ from St. Peter to his vicars ? So in parallel cases , if you understand logic , you will form the same conclusion . Moreover , what holds good in the whole , holds good in the part ; what holds good in the greater holds good in the less . The Roman Church is , as it were , the sum of all Churches , and all other Churches are , as it were , its parts . For as in one respect man is the class of his individual members , and yet in each man resides the property of the whole man , so in one way the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and yet in each Church there reigns the entirety of the whole Christian faith : she is greatest of all the Churches , and what holds good in her should hold good in the less , as the power of the first head of any Church continues to his successors unless there be any express and personal exception . Consequently , as Christ said to all the Roman prelates what he said to Peter , so what Gregory said to all the successors of Augustine , he said in Augustine . The result is , that as Canterbury  | is subject to Rome , because it received the faith thence , so York is subject to Canterbury which sent preachers thither . " To Gregory , the most noble Shepherd of the Holy Church , William , by the grace of God renowned king of the English , and duke of the Normans , greeting with amity .

The skillful architects and artists trained in the process of building and beautifying the Romanesque churches of the eleventh century developed the Gothic style and a sculpture admirably adapted to it . Scholars made translations from Greek authors ; and a veritable torrent of Greek works , notably scientific , which had been preserved in Syrian , Hebrew , and Persian versions , poured into Europe from Spain and other Moslem countries . Europeans discovered that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caliphs than in Europe . Islam did not have within itself any seeds of growth , but in Moslem lands no priestly class dominated the life of a community , intellectually and morally , nor did a powerful church subordinate all knowledge to the purposes of theology . The caliphs promoted study and research along practical lines , with the result that important progress was made in astronomy and in mathematics as an auxiliary science . To the mathematical symbols derived from the Hindus the Arabs added the zero , with its immense simplification in arithmetical processes . Arabs also developed the principles of algebra , and made some progress in trigonometry . Although they used the experimental method , there were limits ; their medical practice did not extend to surgery and the study of anatomy , but they did go much further in the use of drugs and curative herbs than their contemporaries in Christian lands . In the course of the century Latin translations of Euclid and of Arabic books on algebra and trigonometry were accessible in Europe ; so were Ptolemy 's Almagest and the Physics  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astrology and alchemy toward astronomy and chemistry .

A very important advance in the art of navigation was the rudder attached to the stern-post instead of used from the side ; however , this seems to have been developed independently in the waters of northern Europe . Although the general tendency was to depend upon the authority of the written word , there was some progress in scientific observation and experimentation . This intellectual activity can be traced to the stimulating force of trade and of the towns , whose prosperity had been increased by commercial activity . The Mediterranean Sea had been the main highway for trade in the Roman world , but in the seventh and eighth centuries it was partly closed by the rise of the Mohammedan empire . The great Carolingian empire had been an inland empire , with little or no naval power , and the coasts had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In Charlemagne 's time , and after , trade in western Europe had largely been confined to local markets , and the growth of feudalism , with its self-sufficient estates , had promoted the breakdown of everything resembling the former general trading practices . There were no great quantities of produce or goods to market , nor any major urban centers in which to exchange them . There were cities in the feudal period , in the sense that there were relatively large concentrations of people at certain points ; but feudal cities were not made up of a separate , non-feudal commercial class , did not depend on trade for their existence , and had no distinct municipal institutions . For the most part feudal cities were political or ecclesiastical capitals , and since the centers of religious administrative units were more important than political capitals in the decentralized feudal system , cities came almost entirely under church rule . To be sure , some cities were fortresses and under the control of secular rulers ; but in any case the government was little distinguished from other feudal rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the immediate vicinity . The eleventh and twelfth centuries , and especially the latter , saw a rapid development of commerce and a consequent revival of cities  | with a merchant-class population . One reason for this development was a general increase in total population , which led to an opening up of new lands and the formation of new settlements . Another was the stimulus received from outside sources , for example , the trade between Venice and the Byzantine Empire . Venice had originally been founded by refugees from barbarian invaders of the western Roman Empire who fled to the marshes at the head of the Adriatic . The city 's location made it dependent on trade for existence from the very beginning ; Venice had no arable land for the support of its population but it had in its marshes large quantities of salt which could be exchanged profitably . Owing to the character of the Venetian settlers ? i.e. , Roman refugees ? the orientation of the city 's trade was toward Constantinople , the surviving center of Roman imperial authority . As the territories of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the fertile plains of northern Italy , was in an advantageous position for transporting the surplus grain production of the Po valley , and she took on something of the role of purveyor for the Byzantine capital . The great crusades of the twelfth century were a tremendous impetus not only to Venice but to other north Italian cities which were strategically located to transport the large numbers of men and quantities of supplies necessitated by the crusading movement . Because of conquests at the expense of Islam , the crusades had the further effect of re-opening the Mediterranean to the traders of Christian states . While the cities of north Italy were becoming centers or a revived trade in the Mediterranean , a second important center of commerce was beginning to thrive in northern Europe . The region of Flanders developed a native industry based on the unusually fine wool produced in the lowlands , and Flemish cloths and other woolens were in considerable demand . Flemish towns where the textile industry flourished were excellent way stations on all routes of travel ; they were at the northern terminus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rhine valley or up the Rhone and through northern France . Flemish ports were also a contact point for trade with the Northmen of the Scandinavian area and so to the Baltic and the Viking trade routes in Russia . German cities based on commerce and trade began to grow along the great north-south route , and also on the North Sea and Baltic coasts . The growth of these new eleventh- and twelfth-century towns , which were de- pendent on a merchant class distinct from the traditional three estates of feudal society , meant a change in country as well as town life . With the revival of commercial towns a demand was created for agricultural products , for the new towns were not self-sufficient , and the manors which had been operated on a diversified scale to avoid surpluses again found it profitable to produce for a town market . The origins of the distinctive merchant class that filled the commercial towns of the twelfth and later centuries are in part to be found in the Venetian heritage with which other Europeans came in contact during the crusades . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the Venetians because of their relationship with Constantinople and the East during the feudal period . In loading for shipment Venetian merchants divided their goods and by thus pooling the risk avoided ruin if a ship were lost . Venetian ships ordinarily sailed in flotillas for increased safety . Successful merchant enterprise required certain co-operative practices , especially for sea commerce , but the same characteristics were essential for the development of a merchant class when overland trade reappeared on the Continent on a large scale . From Genoa , also , merchants borrowed new capitalist techniques . With the increase of population in the eleventh and twelfth centuries more people became detached from the land , and the adventurous were drawn to the towns as centers of activity and wealth . According to feudal custom a man was a free man if it could not be proved that he had a master , and by maintaining himself in a town for a year and a day a former serf could win his legal freedom . The merchants and free men of the towns were in a peculiar position in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lord and vassal . A special law grew up for these traders , and for better protection of their peculiar freedom as well as for control of their conditions of work and profit they began to form associations , or guilds . By organizing , the townsmen were in a position to gain a voice in political affairs , and the growth of municipal institutions distinct from the feudal or ecclesiastical administration of cities took place . Astute monarchs issued charters giving towns in their kingdoms rights of self-government . The third estate thereby took its first steps toward an emancipation from the control of the aristocracy ,  | both lay and ecclesiastical , through those of the " men of work " who had left the country for the house lived a more comfortable life than the noble in his drafty castle ; the townsman had more society , more varied intercourse , in market and guild-hall and tavern . Membership in his guild gave him an importance and self-confidence that he could not have attained as a single individual . In time the town also became a center of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas from one town to another , and often from far countries . Townsmen developed civic pride , and built strong walls for defense . A walled royal town was a useful pied a terre for a king whose vassals defied him , and levies of town militia were valuable auxiliaries in a trial of strength against a rebellious vassal . Although self-governing communes first developed in northern Italy , settlements of traders in northern lands grew into towns under the stimulus of a reviving trade in the twelfth century . Among the ruins of Roman cities and military camps , about monasteries and castles , and at crossroads a town population came into being which welcomed products from far places . In France the Cistercian abbeys , foundations of a new order of the eleventh century , were centers of great activity . The monks themselves toiled and directed lay brothers and others in the development of large tracts of land , which were often procured by draining swamps and building dikes . The Cistercians entered the colonizing movement which was drawing settlers to the north and east , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , destroy forests wantonly to obtain farm land , but conserved them carefully . They improved the breeds of cattle , horses , and sheep . In England , where the Norman rulers had curbed civil war and where , consequently , flocks could graze undisturbed , the Cistercians bred sheep with long wool and thus helped England to become a source for wool from which fine cloth could be made . Cistercians in Flanders developed the cloth industry and imported the wool grown by Cistercians in England . Flemish towns followed their example and grew rich . Cistercians carried French vines to the Rhine region and developed a wine trade . Colonizing feudal lords in the Baltic lands imitated Cistercian methods in the use of dikes and swamp-draining . The prosperity of German lands was further increased by the development of mining . Saxon miners  | were encouraged to settle in Magyar territory ; but generally the Magyar , Czech , and Polish rulers opposed , though they failed to stop , the flocking of the Germans to their lands . It was a great period of prosperity for Hungary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crusading routes to the Near East . The towns which grew up in these regions were always able to have freer government than towns in the West . Everywhere merchants formed guilds and bargained for rights of self-government with the lords on whose lands the towns stood ; later the craftsmen formed guilds of their own , and shared the government of the towns with the merchant guilds . Trade created a need for a special lay education to train men in computation , and the merchant guilds established schools to teach the rudiments of reading , writing , and arithmetic . This was a radical departure in education , which had been exclusively for clerical personnel , but it did not extend beyond the elementary level . Higher education generally underwent a considerable development during the century along lines already established . The cathedral and monastic schools provided the basis ; they had been formed in large part because of the responsibility of bishops or other high ecclesiastical officials for training men to carry on the work of the church . The teaching was ordinarily limited to grammar and scriptural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but in the twelfth century a number of noted teachers at the great cathedral schools began to attract a variety of students from all over Europe . The school at Chartres was a center for the study of rhetoric , while at Paris dialectics and theology predominated . Out of the great cathedral schools and the increasing number of students attracted to them by famous teachers , grew the medieval universities . These were essentially universities of men , not of buildings or extra-curricular activities . They continued to be based on the seven liberal arts which had been standard since the time of Boethius . The university proper was simply an organization to conduct examinations and issue teaching licenses to those who had mastered the trivium and quadrivium . Gradually three professional faculties developed in which a learned man might achieve the degree of doctor ? divinity , law , and medicine . Guilds of students and teachers were organized at university centers , partly as a matter of convenience for those with common interests , partly for safety , and partly as a means of providing bargaining power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Teachers ' fees were traditionally low ? it had long been regarded as an obligation of the bishop to provide for the welfare of his flock by promoting education ? and both students and teachers were perennially worried by the problem of maintenance . Students at the medieval university had clerical privilege and were not subject to the town authorities but had their own discipline ; rivalry between town and gown was frequently violent , each regarding the other as fair game . The methods of all the great cathedral schools and universities were similar . Instruction was based on the study of authority , and since in the beginning there was a scarcity of texts , the teacher dictated from his own manuscript while the students copied it down and learned the material by rote . The multiplication of texts which resulted later made it possible for most students to have copies , whereupon the teacher lectured or made a commentary on the text which the student had before him . The emphasis on authority induced a great command of material , which was demonstrated through a disputation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree to propose a thesis and then defend it in disputation with all corners . Unfortunately one of the consequences of this method was the creation of a spirit of contentiousness , argument for argument 's sake , and a desire to win no matter how the material might have to be twisted . An almost inevitable consequence of the dialectic methods in the disputation was the rise of scholasticism in the medieval universities . The scholastics , or schoolmen , brought philosophy and reason to the support of dogma in an age when the papal monarchy , canon law , organization , and theology of the church were receiving final form . A great problem of scholasticism was what to do when no rational basis existed for some article of faith ; and the problem created two points of view , as illustrated by the controversy over universals , or abstractions . The realist point of view was that in a conflict between faith and reason , faith must prevail : one did not seek understanding in order to believe . but believed in order to receive understanding . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notable leacher as Roscellinus of Compiegne , was that reason must prevail , for nothing is to be believed unless it is first understood . The nominalist , in his mental concepts , proceeded from the particular material object to the universal idea or principle of that object , whereas  | the realist assumed that the idea came first and then the particular object was created as a reflection of the idea . According to the realist , universals had a real existence entirely apart from human experience with the objects which were the material reflection of the universal . Peter Abelard , although not strictly a nominalist , held the nominalist view of reason , and did much to give it popularity among students . The language of the universities and of the scholastics was Latin , but in the twelfth century vernacular literature began to appear side by side with the learned tongue . One factor that promoted this was the secular elementary education of the guilds ; merchants needed their education for business purposes , not for a study of the Latin literature or ritual of the church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lyric poets in the south of France , known as troubadours . The church had not encouraged the idea of romantic love , but in southern France the noble laity were close enough to feel the effect of Saracen culture , and Arab preoccupation with the pleasures of dalliance provided a model . In the north of France a similar group of poets and singers , the trouveres , sang traditional songs of warlike deeds , the chansons de geste , perpetuating the Arthurian and Carolingian legends . The Song of Roland , one of the greatest of medieval vernacular epics , took written form in this period . Vernacular literature had appeared somewhat earlier in England , with such examples as the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle and Beowulf , an epic poem . In German the great epic was the Nibelungenlied , made up of tales about Theodoric and the invasions of Attila the Hun , but full of mythology and magic ; lyric verse appeared in the songs of the minnesingers , who resembled the troubadours of southern France . The emphasis of the troubadours on the theme of romantic love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather anomalous position occupied by women in the society of the Middle Ages . In theory her status oscillated between the heights and the depths , both with the church and with the aristocracy ? the only literate groups . According to some clerical writers women were the cause of all evil because they were daughters of Eve , by whose temptation Adam had fallen from the state of grace and cursed all the sons of man with that original sin ; according to other clerical writers women were associated with the salvation of man because of the Virgin Mary , mother of Christ . Indeed the cult of the Virgin reached amaz- ing proportions in the Middle Ages , as is witnessed by the number of great churches named in her honor . The aristocracy also glorified woman , in theory , in the cult of the lady which the chivalric code of the troubadours popularized ; on the other hand , women were subjected to men legally in every way . What the peasant classes thought about the exaltation or the subjection of women in society is not recorded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not articulate . In practice , the typical woman of any class was a wife and a housewife . Some women remained independent , for there were generally more women than men in the population ; if a woman of the upper classes did not marry an earthly husband she frequently took Christ as her bridegroom by entering a nunnery , which was in great measure a class institution , to enter which a dowry was required . Marriage in feudal families was a business affair and the primary consideration was the amount of property , or dowry , that could be given away with the bride ; a son or son-in-law was a potential fighting man , and welcome in any family , but no man took the responsibility for adding a female to his household unless she paid her way . The woman of a feudal family who married , however , enjoyed a certain essential equality with the men , for she often had to take over manorial management during her husband 's frequent absence on military or other business . A woman 's dowry rights were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had some bargaining power . ( There must have been not a few strong-minded women to justify the medieval wit who said of the fair sex , " God made ' em to match the men . " ) And if the third estate was composed of the " men of work , " the women were no exception . The peasant wife was the replenisher of the estate , and when she was not engaged in that function worked side by side with her husband in the fields . The dominant role of the clergy in the everyday life of the average individual was established more firmly than ever by the twelfth century with the church 's final formulation of the sacramental system . From the dialectic subtleties of the schoolmen evolved an explanation of the transubstantiation of bread and wine of the Eucharist into the body and blood of Christ sufficiently reasonable to secure its adoption as a dogma of the church at the Fourth Lateran Council ( 1215 ) . The adoption of this dogma meant that the priest , even more than before , was set apart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had it , " made God every day . " At the same time came the final decision that the sacraments were seven in number ; through the administration of the sacraments the church prepared the soul for eternal life , and without them salvation was impossible . By baptism the soul was cleansed of the original sin with which all the sons of Adam were born . In confirmation the Christian was received into the church as a responsible individual capable of knowing truth from error . If he fell into sin the sacrament of penance , after confession before a priest in a truly penitent spirit , restored him to a state of grace and he was fit to receive the eucharist , which renewed his communion with God . Extreme unction was administered at the point of death to save the soul from the terrors of Hell and to substitute the pains of Purgatory preparatory to salvation . Two sacraments were not universally administered : marriage , as a sacrament , was indissoluble if performed correctly , and ordination was only for men entering the priesthood . Thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from birth to death . Final form was also being given to church organization . In the preceding century the College of Cardinals had been created ; the cardinals were the princes of the church , selected by the pope , and charged with one principal function ? the election of a successor when a pope died . For the administration of the vast organization of the universal church an elaborate court . or curia , grew up at Rome , with important branches to handle papal correspondence ( chancery ) and finances ( camera ) . Wealth from the whole Christian world poured into the church 's treasury through the collection or tithes ( an income-tax for the benefit of the church ) and other revenues . The real pivot of the ecclesiastical administration was the bishop , who was elected by the canons of the cathedral chapter . ( In practice , however , the election was often a formality because the bishops were nominated by powerful political rulers . ) The bishop directed the church activities in his province , administered church properties , and supervised the parish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church among the people , administering the sacraments , and often sharing the hardships and tribulations of the parishioners . Perhaps the finest monument to the importance which religious interest and the affairs of the church had in the lives of medieval people is provided by the great cathedrals of the eleventh , twelfth ,  | and thirteenth centuries . Technically a cathedral was the bishop 's principal church ( from Greek cathedra , chair ) and his official seat . Cathedrals were built as community projects , however , and absorbed the finest talents of all classes of people . The main architectural style of church building until the middle of the twelfth century was that known as Romanesque , which had been evolved from the ancient Roman basilica . The essential Romanesque quality was massiveness ; the buildings had thick walls , small windows , semi-circular arches , and barrel-vaulting . Romanesque churches tended to be dark , especially in northern climates which lacked the brilliant southern sunshine under which the style first developed . Mosaics of glass or marble helped relieve the gloom of the interior and provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biblical scenes which helped to make of the cathedrals books in stone for generations that could not read . Symbolism played an important part in cathedral architecture ; the principal axis of the building ran east and west , with the altar at the east end . A rough cruciform shape was given to later churches by the addition of transepts on a north-south axis at the point where the nave and choir met . The west front , which was the main entrance , came to have three portals . Many modifications in detail were made on this basic plan , and cathedrals became very complex structures , but the fundamental lines remained . About the middle of the twelfth century , however , the demand for still finer churches pushed architects to ponder new devices , and led to the rise of the style known as Gothic . It was distinguished from the Romanesque by its delicacy and lightness , effects achieved through the introduction of the pointed arch and ribbed vaulting . Gothic architects were able to concentrate the weight of their vaults at a few points , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Heavy piers were needed to support the concentration of weight , but by the addition of flying buttresses these could be raised to great heights without collapsing . The cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris ( built 1163 ? 1235 ) is characteristic of the transition from Romanesque to Gothic , and the cathedral of Chartres , begun a few years before the end of the twelfth century , is one of the best known examples of the new style . The extent of religious enthusiasm can be seen in the great success of St. Bernard , the man who preserved and made famous the Cistercian order and who upheld the church 's standards of life and  | faith for every rank of society . St. Bernard made his own the affairs of princes and prelates , directed the decisions of synods , drew up rules for the soldier-monks ( the Knights Templar ) , and preached a crusade . The recruiting in the second and third crusades was very successful , but royal as well as papal prestige profited ? the pope made the tactical error of persuading a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a failure , but in the third Philip II ( Augustus ) of France , Richard I ( the Lion-hearted ) of England , and Frederick I ( Barbarossa ) of Germany stole the show , and thenceforth the glory , when there was any , was to go to the rulers who led crusades rather than to the popes who proclaimed them . Frederick Barbarossa in the twelfth century consciously set out to build up an effective government on Roman principles ; his policies toward the towns emphasizes the importance they had achieved ,  | and his relations with the papacy form an important chapter in the struggle for primacy between popes and emperors . At the same time in France Louis VI inaugurated a policy of enlarging the royal domain , which Philip II continued with conspicuous success . In England Henry II by scutage ( accepting the payment of money in lieu of military service owed by a vassal ) weaned many nobles from military preoccupations and provided himself with the funds to pay mercenaries . He further increased the revenues by making royal justice popular and attracting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his attack upon the special privilege of clerics before the law . All the strong rulers insisted on controlling episcopal nominations , and Frederick I was especially successful in his use of bishops as administrators . It was an age when , as the more astute political minds saw , the church had everything to give that the age was ready for : organizing ability and the power that goes with education . The modern state as a mechanism was created in the twelfth century by churchmen .  | THE world into which Bernard of Clairvaux was born was the feudal world at its most violent . Papal efforts to free the church from feudal control seemed to have come to nothing , for lay investiture continued and , despite the church 's ritual , the knight who was the pure-hearted protector of the weak existed only in song and story . The Truce of God and the Peace of God palliated , but did not eliminate , the evils of feudal warfare . The Byzantine appeal for help in the East against the Turks came at a propitious moment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crusades , to inaugurate , a method of diverting feudal warfare to a new field . Unorganized crusades had long been popular ; French pilgrims to the Spanish shrine of St. James of Compostella aided Spanish Christians against the Moors , Greeks and Normans fought the Saracens in the Mediterranean , and the Guiscards won back Sicily for Christendom . Under the aegis of the papacy Pisa recaptured Sardinia and , together with Genoa , freed the western Mediterranean from Moslem control . Organized crusades were precipitated when the Seljuk Turks , who had secured the Bagdad caliphate and conquered Palestine and Asia Minor , interfered with the access to the Holy Places which Christians had enjoyed under Arab rule . The French pope , Urban II , received an appeal from the Emperor Alexius Comnenus for soldiers to help reconquer Asia Minor , and heard from pilgrims many complaints of Turkish atrocities . Pope Urban , who had been forced out of Italy because he continued the policy of Gregory VII with regard to simony and investitures , needed to restore his prestige . He was decidedly successhit in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ing a holy war for the recovery of Jerusalem . At a council held at Clermont ( 1095 ) he appealed to Christian knights to give up fighting one another and to combat the infidel in the name of the Cross , and promised many advantages to crusaders , including plenary indulgences , which meant full release from the pains of Purgatory . Itinerant preachers spread his exhortation , as a wave of enthusiasm swept France , and to some extent affected the chivalry of other countries . Great expeditions , not all of which ever reached their destination , traveled overland to Constantinople and thence with Greek forces through Asia Minor . Several Christian feudal states were set up in Syria by the knights who wore the sign of the Cross , and Jerusalem was taken . According to contemporary accounts the crusaders entered the Holy City with the streets running blood . They proclaimed a kingdom of Jerusalem , and established the military orders of the Knights of St. John of the Hospital and the Knights Templar , to protect Christian shrines against the infidel . All Christendom was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which took place while Bernard was a little boy in Burgundy . He was of noble birth but grew up with the ambition to be a soldier of the Cross in a very different fashion from the crusaders . His delicate physique precluded the career of the feudal warrior , and his relatives urged upon him the life of a scholar , which offered many temptations in the twelfth century . An intellectual awakening had attended the shift of studies from the cloister to the free atmosphere of the towns , and students wandered from one school to another . In Paris the most famous teacher was the master of the school of Notre Dame , William of Champeaux , and among the students who flocked to hear him was a young Breton nobleman named Peter Abelard . William had introduced the dialectic method , with its use of the syllogism , which had been taught by Gerbert , practiced by Lanfranc , and perfected by Lanfranc 's pupil , Anselm of Bec , later of Canterbury . Abelard greatly annoyed William by challenging his statements . In the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is , he asserted that a general idea , such as that of the church , had real existence . Abelard had studied with the famous nominalist , Roscellinus , whose position was that a word like church was merely a convenient name for an idea and that the only reality was that of its components , such as church buildings , the clergy , the ritual , and  | so forth . Abelard rejected both these extremes and put forth a compromise theory which has been called conceptualism , to the effect that universals have real existence only in the mind . The importance of this controversy is twofold : it gave the intellectual world practice in thinking and debating , and for the nominalists , who had the better of the debate as time went on , it diverted interest from abstractions to the study of matter , which led to scientific speculation . For the time being , the eloquence of Abelard triumphed , the students deserted the master 's lectures for those of Abelard , and William left Paris to accept a bishopric . Although Bernard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tempted by the scholar 's life , a sudden mystical experience made him resolve for complete renunciation of the world . With the persuasiveness which was to characterize his whole career he won a group of his young kinsmen to join him . The Cluniac reform had run its course , and a new reformation was due . It began three years after Urban 's great speech at Clermont when a Benedictine monk , desirous of living more strictly than the Cluniacs , founded the Cistercian order at Citeaux in a wild and desolate region . Bernard at the age of 22 came there with his band of followers . Two years later he was made abbot of a new Cistercian monastery at Clairvaux in Champagne . William of Champeaux had become bishop of Chalons-surMarne and was called upon to consecrate Bernard as abbot of Clairvaux . Bernard had so weakened himself by fasting and loss of sleep that William was horrified and secured a command from the head of the Cistercian order that Bernard should give himself up to a year of treatment . The regime to which the young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that period , forced by their vocation to tend the sick , had developed many of the methods approved by modern therapy . The man assigned to care for Bernard removed him from his cell and placed him in a hut outside the monastery , where he would be in seclusion . There he was kept in bed and fed on herbs and food which experimentation had proved to be strength-giving . This regimen was strictly enforced , and Bernard was able thenceforth to carry on a most strenuous career although he was always delicate . He was of medium height , but his extreme thinness made him appear tall ; his hair was pale gold , his beard reddish , his white skin flushed easily , and his eyes were luminous .  | Although he had great charm of manner and a nature singularly gentle , he was at the same time fanatically religious and a fiery and eloquent preacher . The Cistercian order was in danger of failure when he entered it , but he imbued it with life . Whereas Gregory VII and Lanfranc in the eleventh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bernard of Clairvaux and the Cistercians in the twelfth century showed what the regular clergy could accomplish . The eager young men who flocked to Clairvaux were sent out to found new monasteries throughout France and in the Netherlands , Germany , and England . Bernard became known as a worker of miracles , his fame as a preacher spread over Europe , and he was in great demand to aid worthy causes . The abolition of lay investiture was still such a cause , for despite the labors of the Cluniacs it was continuing in England and Germany . William Rufus , after keeping the archbishopric of Canterbury vacant for a long period after Lanfranc 's death , finally in the fear of death appointed Anselm of Bec , an Italian pupil of Lanfranc 's . Under William 's brother and successor Henry I , a bitter quarrel broke out over investiture , and although Anselm was a mild-mannered man , he was firm . In the end a compromise was worked out : the king would give up investiture with ring and staff , and the election would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stipulation that it be held in the presence of the king 's representative , however , gave an opportunity for pressure in favor of the king 's candidate . This agreement provided a model for the settlement of the question in Germany , where Henry V , the rebellious son of Henry IV , continued his father 's policy of appointing bishops and quarrelling with the papacy . In 1122 , after a protracted struggle , he signed a concordat at Worms on similar terms , but worldly bishops continued to be chosen . The year before the signing of the Concordat of Worms a heresy case occurred in which a synod at Soissons condemned one of Abelard 's books to the flames . After his defeat of William of Champeaux , Abelard had become the most popular teacher in Paris . He seduced and then married his brilliant pupil Heloise , and when her relatives castrated him , he became a monk and she a nun . Abelard continued to teach and wrote a book for his students in which he tried to explain the doctrine of the Trinity on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soissons . The church had already begun sanc- tioning the burning of heretics whose practices were regarded as a menace to society , but it had not yet followed the burning of a dangerous book to the logical conclusion of burning the author along with it . Abelard was merely committed to the custody of the monks of St. Denis , whom he outraged by attacking the story that the Areopagite had founded their abbey . While Abelard was undergoing these experiences , which he set down in his remarkable Historia Calamitatum , Bernard was giving church authorities aid against rulers who practiced simony and lay investiture . In France , Louis VI ( the Fat ) had been on the throne since 1108 , the fifth Capetian ruler in direct succession and the first to make any headway against the power of his vassals . He was also the first of his house to adopt a consistent policy of strenghening the royal power by using the townsmen 's support , for he issued charters to towns and to groups of men who would settle on waste lands . He used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office , in order to break the power of the great nobles who at the beginning of his reign controlled the curia regis ( the king 's council ) . The most useful of his clerical officers was Suger , who had been his tutor and whom he made abbot of St. Denis , for , thanks to Suger , Louis remained in Bernard 's good books by making appointments of which the papacy approved . Louis was also the inaugurator of an astute policy of organizing and extending the royal domain : by this a fief , on falling vacant , was added to the royal domain and administered by royal officials , and hence meant one less vassal to give trouble . The eyes of Louis were especially on the fiefs held by the English crown . William the Conqueror 's third son Henry , who succeeded William Rufus in ' too , proceeded to conquer Normandy , declared his daughter Matilda his heir , and married her to Count Geoffrey of Anjou . The son of this marriage would in due course become both king of England and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maine , and Touraine . Louis VI threw out an anchor to windward by marrying his own heir to Eleanor , the granddaughter of the troubadour duke of Aquitaine , thus hoping to annex a large part of southern France . ( Incidentally , Eleanor brought to the French court men of letters who popularized the new lyric poetry . ) Louis VII , when he succceded his father , came to take his wife 's advice rather than that of his able counsellor , Suger . Even with Suger at his elbow , when  | Louis began to nominate bishops he was no match for Bernard , who used the ambition of secular lords to defeat the king 's bid for ecclesiastical control . In 1128 Bernard attended the Synod of Troyes , which recognized the most famous of the military orders which sprang from the Crusades , the Knights Templar . Later he took them to task for worldliness ; still later he drafted rules for them . Two years after the Synod of Troyes he championed the cause of Pope Innocent II , whom the Normans of Sicily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Innocent came to France for help ; and though Bernard secured the support of the French king and of Henry I of England for the pope 's cause , he had greater difficulty with the emperor . In Germany Henry IV 's policy of replacing his great vassals by unknown men had borne its natural fruit , for these men founded great families in their turn . Henry had made a Hohenstaufen ( or Waibling , from the name of one of their seats ) duke of Swabia , and a Guelf ( or Welf ) duke of Bavaria . These two families continued the long rivalry of Swabia and Bavaria , and also came to be associated with the political conflict between emperors and popes , the former being Henry 's designated heirs . After the death of Henry V , who had been as anti-clerical as his father , the archbishops of Mainz and Cologne succeeded in securing the election of the strongly-clerical Lothair II , duke of Saxony and father-in-law of the Welf duke . Then began the long rivalry of Welf and Waibling ( Guelf and Ghibelline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the empire , and especially Italy , were riven . Lothair hesitated for a long time before recognizing Innocent II , but Bernard finally prevailed and Lothair accompanied Innocent to Italy with an army , sworn to establish the pope in Rome . Lothair 's vassal , Conrad of Hohenstaufen , and Roger Guiscard of Sicily , however , supported the anti-pope , and all of Bernard 's eloquence and ingenuity were required to end the schism . Finally Innocent was installed , and he crowned Lothair emperor at Rome ( 1133 ) . The pope gave the emperor as a fief the lands of the Countess Matilda of Tuscany , where the scene at Canossa had taken place , and these proved to be a valuable foothold for an emperor with Italian ambitions . That popes should give fiefs like other feudal lords was a corn ? monplace , but papal control of the city of Rome was periodically  | challenged by Roman nobles and populace , and Innocent II had his troubles . His position was complicated by the exhortations of a certain Arnold of Brescia , who in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole theory of its temporal power . The agitation for communes ? strong at the time in northern Italy , where the commercial stimulus of the crusades was widely felt ? spread to Rome , and a commune was set up there which Arnold defended and served . Bernard , who did not hesitate to rebuke popes for worldliness in his letters to them , had already marked out Arnold as a dangerous agitator ; public agitation was another matter , and he persecuted the Roman leader relentlessly . Bernard 's methods did not depend on force ; for example , he believed heretics should be confronted with argument , and he was an unyielding opponent of the brutalities against the Jews which were an accompaniment to the Crusades . But he did not believe heresy should flourish unchecked , and he was much troubled by the renewed fame of Abelard , now an abbot and again a renowned teacher . Bernard wrote : " In France we have a monk without rule , a prelate without care , an abbot without discipline ; we have Peter Abelard disputing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the streets and thoroughfares the Catholic faith is discussed . Men dispute over the childbearing of the Virgin , the sacrament of the altar , the incomprehensible mystery of the Trinity . . . . " He wrote far and wide to this effect , and Abelard , believing offense was the best defense , demanded to be allowed to confront Bernard at the Council of Sens held probably in 1140 . The meeting took place and Bernard began his attack , but Abelard , apparently realizing that the assembly would yield to the fiery eloquence of the most famous preacher of the day , declared that he appealed to Rome , and left the assembly . The difference between the two monks was summed up by Bernard himself in a letter to Pope Innocent : " He defines faith as being opinion . . . faith is not an opinion , but a certitude . " Thus the mystic condemned the rationalist . Bernard was indefatigable in attacking anything connected with religion which seemed to him to smack of luxury or worldliness , even the magnificent churches that were being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the new Gothic fashion , the favorite style was still the Romanesque , whose great round arches and heavy pillars were very impressive , though the small windows  | in the thick walls kept the interiors dark . In a highly stylized sculpture subordinated to the architecture , sermons in stone for the instruction of the faithful were put in the porches and over the doors . There an attenuated Christ sat in judgment , souls were weighed in the balance , and the damned were tortured by the devil 's auxiliaries ? medieval folk were early schooled to see cruelty under approved auspices . The great Cluniac monasteries were built in this style , and Bernard deplored their size and denounced the sculpture as worldly and a sinful waste , as he also reproached the Cluniac monks for the softness of their lives . He wrote letters of reproach , counsel , and adjuration to great and lowly , to pope , king , and emperor . Everywhere his letters were received with respectful attention ; every assembly he addressed yielded to his eloquence . He took a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , warning him of the dangers to the papal office inherent in the growing practice of appeals to papal courts , a practice encouraged on account of the revenue entailed . Eugenius , on his part , made use of Bernard 's eloquence for the preaching of the second crusade in 1145 . The feudal kingdom of Jerusalem was the most important of the Christian states that had been set up in Palestine as a result of the first crusade . Jerusalem made treaties with the great Italian trading cities and gave them special privileges , including that of tax-free commerce ; thenceforth for the most part crusaders and well-to-do pilgrims traveled by sea , to the vast enrichment of Venice and Genoa . Intercourse with the Moslems led to imitation of their ways of life , and these new contacts meant an influx of goods and ideas into Europe . The Moslems , on their side , naturally planned reconquest of their lands ; in 1144 they captured the principality of Edessa , and other states of the crusaders were threatened . Pope Eugenius III , who had been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Urban II , ideas of increasing papal prestige and believed another crusade was in order . He persuaded Louis VII of France ? who had a guilty conscience because he had been responsible for the burning of a church full of people ? that it was the king 's duty to lead the crusade , and he appointed Bernard to preach it . Bernard succeeded in convincing the emperor that the latter should divide the leadership with Louis . The emperor was Conrad III , a Hohenstaufen successor of the Welf Lothair II , and he spent his entire reign in civil warfare , with the ill-starred second crusade as its only interlude .  | Bernard preached the crusade in many French and German cities and evoked intense enthusiasm . The expedition was a complete failure , however , and when the survivors came straggling back Bernard experienced unpopularity for the first time in his career and was violently attacked . He was unmoved , however , believing the failure to be the inscrutable will of God . The second crusade had , in the end , an important result : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His wife , Eleanor of Aquitaine , had insisted upon accompanying her husband to the East and had aroused his jealousy by her flirtatious behavior . It was the culmination of years of disillusionment , for she had also failed to produce an heir for him . Her hand was immediately sought by Henry Plantagenet , son of Matilda , the heiress of the English king , Henry I ; and the great duchy of Aquitaine passed out of French control . Since her father 's death in 1135 Matilda had been fighting for the succession against Stephen of Blois , the son of William the Conqueror 's daughter , and England had lapsed into anarchy . A compromise was reached in 1153 , the year of the death of Pope Eugenius III , who had proclaimed the second crusade , and of St. Bernard , who had preached it . According to the treaty of Wallingford , Stephen was to be king , but on his death the crown was to go to Matilda 's son Henry . When , in the following year , Henry II and his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they  | brought with them an interest in letters that was to create an intellectual revival once order was restored . The world of St. Bernard of Clairvaux was a world in which urban life was playing an increasing part . In this atmosphere criticism flourished , and took the form of a questioning of existing institutions and prevailing beliefs . The atmosphere engendered by crowds favors the preacher who appeals to emotions , and by this Bernard profited . His childhood memories of the excitement attending the first crusade lent fire to his preaching of the second , and though the crusade failed , the spirit of the crusades was still in the ascendant . From one point of view mundane figures such as Louis VI and Louis VII in France , Henry I in England and Henry V in Germany , busy at putting their royal houses in order , made little show against St. Bernard , going about his Father 's business . On the other hand , their continued employment of trained clerical administrators , Henry I 's use of itinerant justices , Henry V 's negotiation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bridling the power of the feudal lord .  | DURING the years that Frederick Barbarossa was preparing himself for the role of a Roman emperor , the anarchy of England under Stephen ( 1135 ? 54 ) was showing what happened to a feudal kingdom without an effective ruler . The France of Louis VI and Louis VII was not in much better case , although the former had taken steps in the right direction by adding vacant fiefs to the royal domain and by replacing great nobles in office with men of lower rank . Both he and his son easily fell under the sway of any more energetic character to whose influence he was exposed . On the other hand , in the German lands the tradition of Otto I 's rule was still strong after almost two centuries , and although the conditions Frederick faced were as chaotic as those which had confronted Otto , he was as resolved as Otto had been to rule as well as reign . Frederick was a handsome , impressive figure , with golden hair and much personal magnetism . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and knew his classical authors . Although the empire as revived by Otto had not been universal , great prestige attached to the title , and the limits of imperial authority were indefinite ; therefore Frederick had a high opinion of what might be the scope of his power . Frederick had the good fortune to be both Welf and Waibling ; his mother was a Welf , and Henry the Lion of Saxony was his cousin . As heir of the Hohenstaufen emperor , Conrad III , Frederick was elected German king without hesitation . Like his uncle , he watched with complacency the extension of German territory by certain of his vassals , who crusaded against the heathen Slays , extended their possessions beyond the Elbe , pushed back the Danes  | in Holstein , and colonized these conquered lands with peasants brought from Germany . They laid the framework of German power in the Baltic , recovered Mecklenburg , founded Lubeck , and opened trade with the Scandinavians , whom they encouraged to settle . Henry the Lion was the chief of these enterprising magnates , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Elbe , but twenty years later , when Henry refused to follow the emperor into Italy , Frederick confiscated his lands and broke up the great Saxon duchy . Frederick also acquired the county of Burgundy by marrying its heiress , and other lands he bought from Welf lords . Frederick planned to establish his power on the basis of Roman law and Roman tradition . He employed Roman lawyers , declared his empire the Holy Roman Empire , and revived the title of Caesar for his son . His reign saw the inauguration of the custom that the election of an emperor should be by a body of electoral princes . composed of the chief magnates of Germany . His policy toward the church was to put into every vacant benefice a bishop whom he could depend upon to support the emperor rather than the pope , for he saw in papal power a threat to imperial power . He strengthened the allegiance of these bishops by endowing them with greater authority . It is illuminating to compare Frederick 's policy with that of his contemporary , Henry II @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short neck , piercing eyes , and a red face . Full of nervous energy , he was always dashing about ; even in church he talked or scribbled or looked at pictures . With his enormous inheritance and acquisitions by marriage he was a threat to the French crown , for he held more than half of France in fief . His rule in England coincided almost exactly with Frederick 's as emperor ; he became king two years after Frederick 's accession and died the year before him . As English king he destroyed the castles that had been illegally built during the anarchy of Stephen 's reign . He replenished the treasury through reforms in taxation and in the courts . He also revived his grandfather 's custom of sending out itinerant justices , and he made royal justice popular and lucrative by extending the ancient system of sworn witnesses which William the Conqueror used for compiling Domesday Book . From this developed grand juries and trial juries as we know them . The law administered in the royal  | courts was the common law , based upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Roman law , as one of Henry 's judges demonstrated . Henry dealt with his lay vassals through a reorganization of the militia into a force that could be used against them at need . He allowed the substitution of money payments for military service ( scutage ) , and with the money hired professional soldiers , thus encouraging his vassals to cultivate the arts of peace . Henry II hoped to solve the problem of the power of the spiritual lords with the help of his friend and chancellor , Thomas Becket , whom he made archbishop of Canterbury . Becket , however , as archbishop became the defender of the clergy against the king . When Henry appealed to ancient custom in an attempt to prevent criminous clergy from getting off with nominal punishment because all who could read were considered clergy and tried in ecclesiastical courts , Becket defied him . Because Henry did not control the famous Angevin temper in the quarrel that ensued , Becket was murdered by the king 's over-eager followers , who took some of Henry 's words too literally . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reform clerical justice , Becket became a saint in popular opinion , and the Canterbury pilgrimages began , while " benefit of clergy " continued to plague English courts until modern times . In order to avoid the outburst of popular indignation that followed the murder , Henry crossed to Ireland and forced the Irish to admit his overlordship , but they failed to understand what the feudal oath meant , and the foundation was laid for centuries of conflict with their English suzerains . Henry also made the Scottish ruler his vassal . In the task of strengthening the royal power Frederick I was less successful than Henry II but more successful than Louis VII , his French contemporary . In the course of his reign he succeeded to a large extent in breaking up the great fiefs and creating a Germany of small principalities , archbishoprics , and free cities . In Germany he favored the towns as a part of his attempt to weaken the authority of the great feudal lords . In Italy , however , he followed a very different policy , especially in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up their own governments and entrusted to a chief magistrate , called a consul , the rights which bishops and nobles had formerly exercised . These rights , called regalia , the emperor regarded as legally his , as did also the popes , who claimed to have  | received the regalia from the emperor Constantine . The English pope Adrian IV gave Frederick an opportunity to intervene in Italy by appealing for aid against William , the Norman king of Sicily . Frederick , on his arrival in Rome , demanded coronation as emperor , but the pope refused to go through the ceremony until Frederick , after bitter expostulations , consented to hold the pope 's bridle and stirrup . Adrian had expelled Arnold of Brescia and he had been turned over to the secular arm as a heretic . Frederick had him executed , hut left the pope to settle his own affairs with William . Adrian secured recognition of papal overlordship from William , but Frederick later registered a more substantial gain by betrothing his son to the Sicilian heiress , as Otto II had done two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diet at Roncaglia , where he set forth his claims to the regalia . Since the Italian towns refused to recognize his claims , the emperor resorted to force , and the struggle lasted for many years with varying fortunes . In the fifth of Frederick 's six expeditions into northern Italy the league of Lombard towns won a great victory over the imperial troops at Legnano , which was the first serious defeat of feudal horsemen by foot soldiers . The emperor was finally obliged to yield the towns their regalia , but the consuls were to become his vassals and the citizens to swear fealty . In the course of Frederick 's Italian campaigns he also carried on a struggle with the papacy , maintaining a series of anti-popes . Peace was finally made on terms of practical equality , but Frederick retained Matilda 's lands in Tuscany which gave him a strategic foothold in central Italy . The great bulwark of papal prestige was the preaching of the crusades . A third crusade was proclaimed in 1188 and Frederick thought to outshine the pope by heading it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sons . In France , young Philip II had been king since his father 's death in 1180 . Philip had shrewdly made an alliance with Henry and secured the English king 's help in putting down a revolt of the French magnates , but when Henry 's son Richard rebelled against his father , Philip joined him against Henry in 1189 . Henry died during the campaign and Richard succeeded him . Not to be outdone by the emperor , Richard took the cross and Philip II did likewise . These two monarchs journeyed to the East by sea , but Frederick took the overland route and was drowned while fording a stream .  | Frederick 's personality took hold upon the imaginations of the German people and he became a figure of legend . In later years many stories told of his grandson Frederick II crystallized around the first Frederick 's name . The story of " der alte Barbarossa , " sleeping through the centuries in a cave in the mountains , with his sword in his lap and his red beard grown to his feet , ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was told hopefully by many Germans as fortune turned against them in World War I , as it had been in other periods of great crisis . In the world of Frederick I , with kings leading the holy war abroad and extending the king 's peace at home , there was the chance that the national state might one day put in a claim for the people 's attention . The extension of the king 's peace , originally confined to the king 's court , made its most notable progress in the work of Henry II of England . Progress in the same direction in France was apparently in some degree due to imitation of Henry II 's methods ; Philip II extended the king 's peace to the royal domain in France by his baillis , who combined the functions of the English sheriffs and itinerant justices . The world of Frederick I was much like that of St. Bernard ? but it had no great mentor constantly concerned with keeping people 's eyes turned heavenward.  | Since , oh sons of God , you have promised the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ midst and faithfully to sustain the laws of the church , there remains for you , newly fortified by the correction of the Lord , to show the strength of your integrity in a certain other duty , which is not less your concern than the Lord 's .

Whoever thou art , if thou seekest to extol the glory of these doors , Marvel not at the gold and the expense but at the craftsmanship of the work . Bright is the noble work ; but , being nobly bright , the work Should brighten the minds so that they may travel , through the true lights , To the True Light where Christ is the true door . In what manner it be inherent in this world the golden door defines : The dull mind rises to truth through that which is material And , in seeing this light , is resurrected from its former submersion . We searched around everywhere by ourselves and by our agents for an abundance of precious pearls and gems , preparing as precious a supply of gold and gems for so important an embellishment as we could find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . One merry but notable miracle which the Lord granted us in this connection we do not wish to pass over in silence . For when I was in difficulty for want of gems and could not sufficiently provide myself with more ( for their scarcity makes them very expensive ) : then , lo and behold , monks from three abbeys of two Orders ? that is , from Citeaux and another abbey of the same Order ,  | and from Fontevrault ? entered our little chamber adjacent to the church and offered us for sale an abundance of gems such as we had not hoped to find in ten years , hyacinths , sapphires , rubies , emeralds , topazes . Their owners had obtained them from Count Thibaut for alms ; and he in turn had received them , through the hands of his brother Stephen , King of England , from the treasures of his uncle , the late King Henry , who had amassed them throughout his life in wonderful vessels . We , however , freed from the worry of searching for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lot though they were worth much more ... . Thus , when ? out of my delight in the beauty of the house of God ? the loveliness of the many-colored gems has called me away from external cares , and worthy meditation has induced me to reflect , transferring that which is material to that which is immaterial , on the diversity of the sacred virtues : then it seems to me that I see myself dwelling , as it were , in some strange region of the universe which neither exists entirely in the slime of the earth nor entirely in the purity of Heaven ; and that , by the grace of God , I can be transported from this inferior to that higher world in an anagogical manner . . . . To me , I confess , one thing has always seemed pre-eminently fitting : that every costlier or costliest thing should serve , first and foremost , for the administration of the Holy Eucharist . If golden pouring vessels , golden vials , golden little mortars used to serve , by the word of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blood of goats or calves or the red heifer : how much more must golden vessels , precious stones , and whatever is most valued among all created things , be laid out , with continual reverence and full devotion , for the reception of the blood of Christ ! Surely neither we nor our possessions suffice for this service . If , by a new creation , our substance were re-formed from that of the holy Cherubim and Seraphim , it would still offer an insufficient and unworthy service for so great and so ineffable a victim ; and yet we have so great a propitiation for our sins . . . .  | The letter to Suger shows that St. Bernard was lavish of praise when he felt it was deserved . On the other hand nowhere is it possible to find sterner condemnation of the mingling of lay and clerical functions in the higher ranks of the clergy in the feudal age .

He had lucrative rights over his vassals , and on occasion he even defied his king . He was to retain power and prestige for centuries , but before the thirteenth century closed rulers had less need of him . The efficiency of the central government was increased by Louis IX in France , Edward I in England , and Frederick II in Sicily . In several kingdoms the rise of the third estate was recognized by the summoning of its representatives to the great council of the realm . The possession of money was becoming more important than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the feudal army at the battle of Bouvines reinforced the warning of Legnano that warfare was not to continue the affair of the feudality alone . The papacy reached its height in the thirteenth century . Innocent III made the proudest monarchs bow to his will , received eight rulers as vassals , ' and for a few years was acknowledged head of the Eastern church . A great new monastic movement was devoted to papal service . St. Thomas Aquinas gave a formulation to the Chris- tian faith which is still authoritative for the Roman communion . Gothic churches of a beauty not before known expressed the devotion of the faithful . Yet in the last decade of the century Boniface VIII met defeats at the hands of Philip the Fair and Edward I. When the fourth crusade , at the beginning of the century , turned into a commercial enterprise against Constantinople , and the Albigensian crusade was launched against heretics in southern France , it became evident that the ardor which put Christendom in arms against the East in the name of the faith had waned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revive it . Society was turning secular . These changes were not unconnected with the intellectual and social stimulus that resulted from contact with the Moslem world . This influence had long been at work , but its effects , cumulative in this century , gave a definite character to the period . The contact between Christian and Moslem in Spain , in Sicily , and in Syria during the period of the Christian feudal kingdoms there , produced in each group a certain toleration for the faith of the other . Commercial contacts between Europe and the East had even more notable consequences , however , than the intermingling of peoples . Such products new to Europeans in the field of textiles as cotton , muslin ( Mosul ) , and damask ( Damascus ) , were introduced . New trade routes were exploited , and more advanced techniques of navigation were widely spread through contact with Byzantine , Moslem , and Italian practices ? larger vessels , use of instruments like the compass and the astrolabe , and better maps .. Adventurous merchants were able to penetrate Asia even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Constantinople , were led to the Black Sea , into Russia , and so across central Asia to the Far East . It is also noteworthy that Genoese sailors , apparently trying to outflank the Mohammedan control of the middle routes to the East , rediscovered the Canary Islands about 1270 . Commerce and the crusades stimulated the return of money and credit to the economic system of Europe in general ; during the earlier feudal age it had been based to an important degree on barter . Gold was used in coinage again . ( The ducats minted in the duchy of Apulia in the middle of the twelfth century are supposed to have been the first gold coins struck in western Europe since the time of Charlemagne . ) Credit was practically a necessity during the crusades to meet the needs of pilgrims or crusaders who found  | it at best inconvenient and usually dangerous to carry any large sums of money with them . The order of the Knights Templar , with chapter houses in many parts of the European and Mediterranean world , employed banking practices , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another . The trade empires built by Italian city states during the crusading era used the same methods . The social character of western Europe changed greatly during this period . The number of freemen who could swell the ranks of the merchant class and town population was increased by a process of serf emancipation , sometimes as a pious act by a noble crusader uncertain of the fate in store for him , sometimes by sale in order to raise capital to finance a crusade . For many people of western Europe the new opportunities opened by commerce and the crusades meant a freedom from the agricultural existence to which they had been bound . The gain in the free class was accompanied by a corresponding decline among the feudal nobility , who lost financial resources in the expenses of the crusades , as many were forced to surrender property rights or feudal dues . This feature of the period , together with the inevitable casualties in the male population of noble families , was particularly advantageous for the kings who were trying to build up monarchical power in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasing year by year , both in England and on the Continent . The feudal lords held their authority as long as land was the chief source of wealth , and little money was in circulation . Papal claims to power had been facilitated by the effectiveness of papal taxation , which drew off much of the money in existence . By the thirteenth century , when the towns had become centers of trade , money was to be found there , and the nobles , when they needed funds to outfit themselves for the crusades , borrowed it from the townspeople and gave concessions in exchange . While their feudal lords were away in the East , towns grew prosperous . Craft guilds had come into existence , established on sound social principles , and were replacing the merchant guilds . The craft guilds maintained high standards of craftsmanship , established ceiling prices , forbade cornering the market and other unethical practices , provided death benefits , and cared for widows and orphans . A poor man by himself was nothing ; as a member of his guild he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a mystery  | play with others of his guild , and he could point proudly to the window his guild had placed in the new cathedral . Cathedrals in earlier days were usually built where it suited the bishop 's convenience ? accessible to his palace , which was frequently on the citadel . With the growth of the townsmen 's importance they came to be built in the market place , where the citizens gathered . The thirteenth-century cathedrals , in the new Gothic style developed in northern France , were beautiful structures . Romanesque churches had been comparatively dark ; in the Gothic churches the walls , no longer needed for support of the roof , more and more were simply frames for gloriously colored glass . The whole structure gave the impression of unity , through multiplicity . The music that rang from the choir through the soaring nave was a music that expressed a similar spirit . Polyphony , or counterpoint ( which had probably originated in the singing of the Celts and Germans , among whom an instrument accompanied the voice ) had also come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to be accompanied by another sung several tones below , and then by three or four voices an octave apart . In the thirteenth century rounds were sung commonly by the people , and the tune of the farmers , " Sumer is icumen in , " was supplied with religious words . In France the motet was developed . While Frenchmen were building Rheims Cathedral and Englishmen Salisbury , the Moors of Granada built their Alhambra . Religion was an impelling force , but the static character of Islam prevented it from becoming a force for progress . The secular nature of Saracen culture began to have its counterpart in the trends of thirteenth century European society . The Gothic cathedral in the market place was confronted by the guildhall . The guilds of teachers and of students which were organizing into universities became centers of learning where laymen like the great Italian poet Dante studied with no intention of becoming priests . The universities also served as centers for a new study of Aristotle , based on works of which the West had been ignorant but which were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world through the translations of Averroes . The learned and original Robert Grosseteste and his pupil Roger Bacon , English university men both , went so far as to proclaim experiment the way to the attainment of knowledge . Although West had learned much  | from East during the period of the crusades , after the thirteenth century the West overtook and outstripped both Byzantine and Mohammedan culture . The fourth crusade gave Venice control of the trade of Constantinople , but later in the century the Greeks overthrew the Latin kingdom with the help of Genoa , which thenceforth shared control of the eastern trade . A great new power arose in Asia , the Mongol empire of the mighty warrior , Genghis Khan , whose forces overran eastern Europe and ruled Russia for the next two hundred years . The Venetian merchant , Marco Polo , traveled across Asia to the court of the Great Khan in China , and his account of what he saw there was to influence men 's imaginations in the following centuries . It is difficult to place inventions into an exact period , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the latter part of the thirteenth century . Mechanical clocks were used . The spinning wheel , long known in India , did much to develop the flourishing cloth industry in Europe . Elaborate looms , known in China , began to be common in Europe . Up to a point the Christian church followed the movement of its people toward secular preoccupations . Innocent , unable to prevent the diversion of the crusades to secular purposes , settled for temporary control of the Eastern church . Later popes definitely utilized the remnants of the crusading spirit to further purely secular ends ? especially against the Hohenstaufen , employing money raised originally for holy war against Islam . It came to be suspected that the papacy regarded crusades as a matter of expediency and as a justification for taxes . There was also some breakdown in the discipline by which the church maintained its authority in everyday life . The administration of the sacrament of penance was a strong weapon , but its effectiveness was vitiated by the system of indulgences ? that is , a remission of penance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . During the crusades the popes promised plenary indulgence for the noteworthy good deed the crusader performed by fighting the infidel . Abuse developed over release from the vow taken by every crusader , when for some cause it became impossible to fulfill . To avoid excommunication for failure to keep the vow , a material contribution to the holy cause could be substituted . When releases thus became vendible , the papacy had  | actually acquired a new source of revenue which later came to be used for any papal need , not simply for war against infidels . The popes indirectly aided the work of secularization by providing a new stimulus to learning . The Franciscan order was turned from its pursuit of poverty to become a bulwark of the papacy and leader in the cause of learning . Following the Dominicans , Franciscans became professors in the universities . Three men typify thirteenth century tendencies . Innocent III brought the authority of the church to its height . Frederick II waged the medieval battle between empire and papacy ; in his Sicilian kingdom he inaugurated a modern state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was a modern in his use of the vernacular , which throughout Europe was coming into its own . Everywhere  | the fabliaux , short stories of the life of the people , and moralized stories of animals like " Reynard the Fox " were within the common speech . The morality plays sanctioned by the church were in the vernacular . Jean de Meung wrote the Romance of the Rose ; Villehardouin , the Conquest of Constantinople ; and de Joinville , his Life of Louis IX , in the vernacular . Dante wrote his learned works in Latin , but put his great poem , The Divine Comedy , in the Tuscan dialect for all to read . In subject and treatment , however , the poem is entirely medieval . Dante shows the sun , moon , and planets revolving about the earth as a center , providing abodes of bliss graduated to the desert of souls who had won salvation . Toiling up the mountain of Purgatory , those destined for salvation expiate their sins in order of their heinousness . In the bowels of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of guilt . Moving from one level to another , the poet voices accepted moral judgments , placing sinful popes in Hell , and mourning over the failure of the emperor to give reality to the ancient vision of a united Christendom where , under the aegis of the universal power of the Roman Empire , peace would unite the peoples under law . Progressing from one crystalline sphere to another , Dante witnessed the increasing bliss of those whose lives on earth approached perfection more nearly , until beyond the seventh heaven lay the empyrean , the abode of celestial beings . Thus the astronomy of Ptolemy was made to fit into the divine vision .  | POPE INNOCENT III was born eight years after the death of St. Bernard . He was eleven when Thomas Becket was murdered in his cathedral at Canterbury , and he was about twenty when in the city of Assisi was born the child whose fame was to grow until he was recognized as one of the greatest of the saints ? St. Francis . When Innocent was 29 he was made a cardinal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Philip Augustus were in Sicily making their stormy way toward the Holy Land in the third crusade . At the age of 37 Innocent was made pope ( 1198 ) . He was a nobleman of mixed German and Italian blood , a small man , of dignified bearing , thoroughly trained in theology and law ; and he took up the office of Vicar of Christ with the firm purpose of vindicating its supremacy . He chose for the text of his consecration sermon : " For to me it is said in the Prophets , I have this day set thee over the nations and over the kingdoms . " A born diplomat and a shrewd observer of men , he looked cannily over the nations and the kingdoms . What Innocent saw was a welter of discord . Of the secular rulers the most formidable was Philip II ( Augustus ) of France , who had built walls about the city of Paris and made it a more comfortable place of residence , and whose eyes were fixed firmly on the royal domain , in spite of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philip reformed the administration , installing trained royal officials known as baillis , and he planned for a wider domain to which these reforms should be extended . The obvious additions were the fiefs held by Richard of England , since the danger that England might swallow up France was real at the end of the twelfth century .  | Richard I , the so-called troubadour king , had spent his youth in Aquitaine and had always a minstrel or two in tow , but he was primarily a soldier . He had gone with enthusiasm on the third crusade . Philip II went along because French public opinion expected it , but quarrelled with Richard , sought the first opportunity to return to France , and began intrigues with Richard 's brother John . Richard negotiated a truce with the Saracen leader Saladin , deserted his army , and returned homeward in disguise ? only to be taken prisoner and held for ransom by Barbarossa 's successor , Henry VI . The English raised the heavy ransom Henry demanded , and Richard on his release forced Philip to return the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ III caught Philip at a disadvantage and excommunicated him for having put away his wife , a Danish princess . Not daring to face public disfavor , Philip yielded and restored her to her rights . When Richard died , Philip recognized John as heir although John 's young nephew , Arthur , had a better claim . Within a few years John failed to appear at a feudal court held by Philip to be tried for an offense against another of Philip 's vassals , and as this was a breach of the feudal contract , John 's fiefs were declared forfeit . Within the year John offended his French vassals by having Arthur murdered , and he failed to prevent Philip from taking over Normandy and the Angevin lands . John was able , however , to succeed to his mother 's fiefs of Aquitaine and Gascony . Innocent had his way clear with John , who was one of the ablest of the Angevins but was unprincipled and unlucky , since John set every class of his subjects against him by his rapacity . He substituted his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and when both appeared at Rome claiming the gallium , the strip of wool which designated the office , Innocent chose instead an able Englishman named Stephen Langton . John refused to accept him and Innocent proceeded to lay England under an interdict , which meant deprivation of the sacraments . As this did not bring John to terms , he was first excommunicated and then deposed , and when Innocent invited Philip to enforce the deposition , the French king , nothing loth , prepared to invade England . John hastily accepted Langton and went far beyond the pope 's demands , for he declared England was a papal fief ? a shrewd bit of diplomacy which guaranteed him papal support .  | In the meanwhile the Emperor Henry VI 's marriage to the heiress of Sicily had fulfilled its purpose . A son was born , a second Frederick , who on the death of his father became king of Sicily , which included southern Italy up to the borders of the papal states . Between Sicily and the imperial lands to the north , the papal states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew well , through the troubles of his predecessors , what dangers this power of the Hohenstaufen constituted for the papacy ; and consequently he set aside the claims of his young ward , Henry 's son Frederick , in favor of the Guelf candidate , Otto of Brunswick , grandson of Henry II of England . Although Otto made great promises before his coronation , as emperor he repudiated them , and Innocent during the quarrel decided to encourage young Frederick to take over the crown after all . Philip II sided with Frederick , and John , hoping to win back his lost French fiefs , supported Otto , who also had on his side a number of Philip 's vassals . But Frederick 's supporters won the battle of Bouvines in 1214 , and John had to face rising discontent at home . The great vassals in England were dissatisfied with John 's demands for aids and in 1215 , led by the Archbishop Stephen Langton , whom he had distrusted , they rose against him . He was forced to accept the famous Magna Carta , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submission to Innocent III now stood him in good stead , for the pope declared Magna Carta void , but the barons fought the decision , and John 's sudden death brought the quarrel to an end . Magna Carta was confirmed by later kings , and through a too literal interpretation of some of its provisions it became in a later day an instrument for securing the liberties of the citizen . It was for the most part a feudal document and actually a check on feudalism since it defined , and thus limited , the extent of a feudal lord 's power over his vassals . It was of constitutional importance because it revived the ancient principle that the king was subject to the law . The success of the barons was an acknowledgment of their right to use force against a king who broke the law . Venice was the most important of the Italian cities and its pros . perity rested upon its Eastern trade . The Venetians developed a grudge against the cities the Normans had established in southern Italy and Sicily because they were rivals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Adriatic . When a Hohenstaufen at .  | tempted to squeeze the papal states in central Italy , the pope could always look for help to Venice and other cities of northern Italy which had adopted the policy of opposition to the emperor fostered by the Lombard League . The crusading movement had been launched by the papacy and had given the popes prestige at first , but later the glory had been stolen by the monarchs . Innocent determined to win it back , and early in his pontificate issued a call to a fourth crusade . The wily Venetians succeeded in diverting the crusaders to the conquest of Constantinople , and set up a Latin kingdom which lasted until 1261 . Innocent expressed annoyance at the turn the crusade had taken , but was placated when he was asked to nominate the patriarch of Constantinople . He then preached a Crusade for the conversion of the heathen in the Baltic region , and gave still another turn to the crusading movement by launching a crusade against heretics . Heretics were actually regarded as worse than heathen since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Heresy had increased with the development of towns , where life provided many secular interests and the critical spirit flourished . Heresies usually took either the form of criticism of the clergy for departing from the simplicity of the gospel or that of doctrinal aberration . The heresy of Peter Waldo of Lyons belonged to the first class ; he concluded that God meant men to guide their lives by the Scriptures , and he formed a society whose members translated and expounded the Bible , turning their backs upon priests and organized religion . The second form of heresy was most conspicuously represented in Innocent 's day by the Albigenses , or Cathari , whose beliefs led them to social irregularities and whose ideas had spread through the most prosperous regions of southern France . Innocent 's crusade was a crusade against these two groups ; the Waldenses were driven into the Alps , where they survived , while Philip II cynically allowed some of his vassals to be advance agents for the royal domain by joining the fight against the Albigenses . Led by Simon de Montfort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who , before the end of the reign of Philip 's successor , had been exterminated ; and the lands of the feudal rulers of southern France were escheated to the French crown . Although Simon de Montfort deterred Innocent from preaching a crusade against the Moors in Spain , the pope interfered with the  | rulers of the Christian kingdoms which were slowly pushing the Moors southward . He forced the king of Aragon to recognize him as overlord , the king of Leon to put away his wife , and the king of Portugal to pay him tribute . He was so successful in imposing his will upon the king of Poland that the prince of Bulgaria deemed it advantageous to declare himself the pope 's vassal . Innocent 's power was at its height when , in 1215 , the year of Magna Carta , he called the fourth great council to assemble in the ancient church of St. John of the Lateran . At this council , which was attended by the representatives of princes as well as by the clergy , Innocent decreed a way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the suppression of heretics . He declared that the duty of all Christians was to confess and take communion at least once a year . He provided for reorganization of the hierarchy and the reform of pluralities , clerical marriage , and use of relics not authorized by the pope . Frederick II , and not Otto IV , was proclaimed the lawful emperor , and Raymond of Toulouse , who had protected the Albigenses , was to be deposed in favor of his conqueror , Simon de Montfort , who was to hold Toulouse as a papal fief . Regulations were devised to set aside the Jews as a subordinate people ; measures were taken for setting the clergy apart from the laity and for freeing them from taxation . Transubstantiation was made a dogma . Triumphant in all his policies , Innocent then proclaimed a new crusade , but did not live to launch it , for he died in the next year . Innocent III was to go down in history as the pope who most completely realized the ideal of papal supremacy . Perhaps his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service of a movement which was the negation of his majestic claims . On Innocent 's accession to the papacy Francis of Assisi was a boy of sixteen , enjoying with other sons of prosperous merchants the pursuits of carefree youth . Suddenly he had a conviction of sin , gave away all that he had , and started to live a life devoted to the love and service of all created things . By practicing the gospel of Christ literally Francis hoped to confound the heretic , convert the heathen , and regenerate the earth . The brethren of the order which he formed were to labor for their food and to live a wandering life , barefoot and clad in a brown robe girded by a rope . The possibilities of the Franciscan brotherhood as a valuable weapon were perceived by Innocent , but to Francis 's request for recognition he gave only lim- ited approval , seeing in the stress on poverty a reproach to recognized custom which might be dangerous . Thus not until the Franciscans had modified the aims of the friars was their order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Mount could scarcely appeal to the majestic lord of all the earth . Innocent 's task was to maintain the unity of the church ? to scrutinize and chastise heresy . Heresy was always ready to break out , either as a criticism of the worldliness of the clergy in comparison with the simplicity of Christ , or as a questioning of the Church 's doctrine in the light of Scripture or the Fathers . Francis 's stress on poverty might well develop into the former type of heresy , despite the fact that to him " holy poverty " was a confutation of heresy . Innocent 's world was an age which saw a succession of important scholars ; the great Arab Averroes died the year of Innocent 's accession to the papacy , and Robert Grosseteste belonged to Innocent 's  | generation . By Innocent 's crusade against the Albigenses , the Spanish St. Dominic was inspired to found his Order of Preachers to work for the conversion of the heretic and the heathen . Dominicans were the most important rivals of the Franciscans , and at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dominic and Innocent had much in common in matters of the faith , for both were well-educated men , but when it came to religion pure and undefiled both the triumphant pope and the learned preacher had to yield to St. Francis of Assisi . p THE marriage of Frederick Barbarossa 's son to the heiress of the kingdom of Sicily had far-reaching results . Some historians hold that Frederick II , the issue of the marriage , as ruler of the southern kingdom brought the modern world of predominantly secular interests into being . Growing up among the ruins of ancient Greece and Rome , surrounded by influences that stemmed from Byzantium and from the Moors , he developed an outlook on life less completely overshadowed by the church than that of his contemporaries . In contrast , Louis IX , the grandson of Philip Augustus , was a king who so successfully typified the ideal of a Christian ruler that he was canonized by the church . France during his reign was the Middle Ages at its height . In Paris the schools of Abelard 's day had developed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paris , and its faculty of theology , under the leadership of the Dominican Albertus Magnus , was busy building on the basis of the prevailing interpretation of Aristotle a harmonious system of doctrine . Vincent of Beauvais was writing a compendium of human knowledge . Outside the precincts where divinity reigned , vernacular literature was finding its footing in Goliardic songs , in Villehardouin 's Conquest of Constantinople , and in jean de Meting 's completion of the Romaunt de la Rose . Leonin , the choirmaster of Notre Dame , and his successor , Perotin , had used the new polyphonic music in elaborate compositions in which the organ , supporting boys ' and men 's voices , filled with swelling chords the lofty naves of the churches . The finest of these churches was Chartres , dedicated in the new fashion to the Virgin , not to a saint or archangel , like earlier fanes.  | While the troubadours had developed an elaborate code of honor and of service to a chosen lady and had thereby brought into society a civilizing force , the church , fearful of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devotion to an earthly woman the adoration of the Mother of God . Churches in increasing numbers were being dedicated to Our Lady . In churches and cathedrals otherwise dedicated , Lady chapels appeared in the place of honor behind the high altar . To the mystery and miracle plays popular among the people were added new plays about miracles the Virgin wrought for sinners who called upon her name . Educated in the best learning of the day and in the code of chivalry and a devout servant of the church , Louis IX , when he attained his majority , dedicated himself to the recovery of the Holy Places and set out on a crusade against the sultan of Egypt , who controlled them . In England another boy king , John 's son Henry III , grew up a pious prince , though no paladin . His first guardian twice reissued Magna Carta , with modifications , and the second bowed to papal mandates and began a policy of allowing the pope to provide Italian incumbents for English benefices . When Henry took over the government he continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relatives of his French wife . These policies aroused much criticism and in time produced revolt and civil war . Meanwhile the German princeling , Frederick I1 , grew up in Sicily under Greek and Moslem tutors , a resolute though sickly man , with the curiosity of a modern scientist and unlimited ambition . His whole career was given over to struggle . We have seen how the battle of Bouvines , which sealed the loss of King John 's French fiefs , secured for Frederick the imperial crown under Innocent III 's patronage . Frederick was crowned at Rome in 122o by Innocent 's successor , Honorius III . Before his coronation as emperor he had persuaded the Germans to choose his son Henry as king , but to do so had been obliged to extend the powers of the ecclesiastical princes . These powers included the control of all the towns in ecclesiastical lands , and as a result the great archbishoprics , Mainz , Trier , and Cologne , became practically independent states . Like his grandfather and many of his successors , Frederick had an eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military order , known as the Teutonic Knights , which a Polish duke invited to aid him in the conversion of the Prussians .  | Frederick confirmed the grants given them , and they proceeded , along with their missionary labors , to carve out a principality for themselves along the Baltic which effectively cut Poland off from the sea . Frederick II renewed the claims the first Frederick had made on the north Italian towns and proceeded to enforce them in a series of campaigns , during which one pope after another joined his enemies . This was to be expected in view of Frederick 's possession of Sicily . His aim was to build up a system of strong government in both his northern and his southern kingdoms , and the ruler of the papal states in the middle was unlikely to be enthusiastic . Frederick had put a weapon into the papal hands when , apparently yielding to impulse , he took the Cross during his coronation ceremony . He was excommunicated for not fulfilling his vow to go on a crusade , and was excommunicated a second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he finally secured by treaty instead of conquest the end his crusade had in view , he was excommunicated a third time for dealing with the unbeliever , and a crusade was declared against his Sicilian lands . In the intervals of Frederick 's struggles with the papacy , he established in his Sicilian realm the strong government which is his greatest claim to fame . The modern idea of a state supported by an efficient system of taxation , and giving its citizens protection and justice in an orderly fashion , was only slowly developing in England and France out of the conflict between crown and feudal lords . In Sicily both Greek and Mohammedan influences pointed toward such a state , and to a considerable extent Frederick succeeded in establishing one there . There was nothing feudal in his system of administration and taxation . His methods were the same as those by which twentieth century dictators consolidated their power : restriction on the freedom of the citizen , government control of trade , religious persecution , and a special police without sympathy for human suffering . At his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regardless of creed . Brought up among Moslems and Greeks , Frederick II saw the best points of the Mohammedan faith ; one of the most bitter accusations hurled against him by the papacy was that he declared that Christ , Moses , and Mohammed were all imposters . He had an extensive menagerie , and set down the results  | of his observations of birds in his well known treatise on falconry . Much useful research in the sciences was carried on directly by him or under his patronage . He revived the old school of medicine at Salerno , and set the fashion of royal charters for universities by creating a university at Naples . The world of Frederick II was a world which he amazed and shocked , for he was too modern to be understood and esteemed . The ideal figure of the age was Louis IX of France , the perfect champion , the embodiment of chivalry , the knight who was pure in heart and protected the weak . Louis 's reign was so genuinely one of devotion to high principles that his assumption that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepted by his subjects as a true conception of the monarchy , and enabled his successors to exercise arbitrary power when they did not , like St. Louis , have the people 's welfare at heart . Frederick 's checkered career ended somewhat ignominiously . He had left Germany in the hands of his son , who proved unfaithful to the trust and whom he threw into prison . After finally securing the election of a pope whom he thought he could trust , he found himself again the object of papal hostility and began the conquest of the papal states . He died in the middle of this campaign . Although his son Conrad IV lived four years longer , effective Hohenstaufen rule ended with the death of Frederick II , whom men called Stupor Mundi.  | WHILE in France and England the royal power was being extended at the expense of the feudal lords , and in Germany feudalism reigned triumphant despite the efforts of the Hohenstaufen to strengthen imperial power , Italy was developing along quite different lines . In the centre of the peninsula the popes dominated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Adriatic . South of the papal states , dukes of Anjou and princes of the Spanish house of Aragon claimed the lands where Frederick II had built up a well-governed realm , for the dynasty of the Hohenstaufen came to an end with his ill-fated grandson Conradin ( 1268 ) . In Italy the feudal lords had long since given up their isolated castles and gone to live within the walls of the towns , where their interests became identical with those of the townsmen . Each town claimed the surrounding territory upon which it was dependent for food , and sought to enlarge this territory at the expense of its neighbors . Of these city states the republic of Venice , enriched by trade with the East , was the most powerful . Its chief rival was Genoa , which had grown rich by carrying crusaders to the Holy Land and by building up a prosperous return trade . Milan , dominating the Lombard plain , acted as middleman in the commerce between the East and the countries north of the Alps . The prosperity of Florence had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for turning rough fabrics into beautiful brocades and damasks , and Florentine bankers did the greater part of the banking for the popes , spreading their activities to all cities of Europe . Other cities copied the methods of these leading city states on a smaller scale , and in all of them local politics followed the old pattern , made in Germany ,  | of rivalry between Guelf and Ghibelline ? papal party versus imperial party . Sons of prosperous merchants in the great commercial cities were able , if it suited their fancy , to pursue an education with no thought of vocational aim , and thus appeared the phenomenon which was to help build the modern world ? the educated layman . The Florentine Dante Alighieri was one of these , a man of extraordinary mental powers , who became the greatest scholar of his time . It is not known , however , where he was educated . His native city had no university and was not to have one for another hundred years . There were , however , many well known intellectual centers : in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for law , Salerno , for medicine , and Frederick II 's new university at Naples . In France Montpellier and Toulouse were popular . But the renown of the University of Paris was greatest of all ; there Thomas Aquinas ( d. 1274 ) , the great Dominican pupil of Albertus Magnus , had worked out his Summa Theologiae . The Summa was a philosophical system in which the Metaphysics of Aristotle , recovered from the Arabs and prohibited to Paris students at the beginning of the century , was harmonized with Christian doctrine and thenceforth prescribed instead of proscribed . Dante knew the Summa thoroughly , and he learned all that Albertus Magnus and Roger Bacon had known of natural science . Brunetto Latini , a Florentine who was a great student of classical antiquity and an advocate of popular learning , we know was one of his teachers . With Dante , though , scholarship was not an end ; he was first of all a poet . Unfortunately , however , he was also a politician , and in 1302 was banished from Florence with others of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exile . Two years before Dante left Florence , Pope Boniface VIII held a jubilee in Rome ( 1300 ) ; its success encouraged the pope 's exalted idea of the papal office . Boniface , like Gregory VII and Innocent III , put forth claim to the right of popes to control and even depose princes . The chief opponents of the pope 's claim were two princes who had been systematically and efficiently consolidating monarchy in their respective countries : Edward I of England , and Philip IV ( the Fair ) of France . Edward I had been able to learn in the reign of his pious father , Henry III , the dangers that follow the misuse of royal power . The English were attached to their ancient common law , and kings who failed to respect the rights believed to be crn- bodied in the " good old laws of Edward the Confessor " were likely to have trouble on their hands . After the death of Frederick II the pope offered the crown of Sicily to Henry , who was subservient to the papacy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised money for the conquest of the island without regard to the limitations of his powers . The king was unpopular and all classes backed a movement to apply the principle that the king was under the law . The barons invoked the provisions of Magna Carta . By the Provisions of Oxford , drawn up in 1258 , the barons compelled the king to reaffirm Magna Carta , dismiss foreign favorites , oppose heavy papal taxation , and submit to the supervision of a committee of the Great Council . The king did not keep his agreement , and for a brief period Edward was drawn into the struggle against his father . In the civil war that broke out , the leadership of the rebels was assumed by Simon de Montfort , a younger son of the leader of the Albigensian crusade . The end of the wars came with Simon 's defeat and death at the battle of Evesham ( 1265 ) . Edward I 's accession marked the emergence of a prince who was wholly English in training and sympathy . One of the chief grievances against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the pope to English benefices . Edward resolved that papal provisions should cease and that the growing power of canon law should be checked . He restricted the jurisdiction of the ecclesiastical courts and levied heavy taxes on the clergy to pay the expenses of his foreign wars . Boniface VIII issued the famous bull Clericis Laicos ( 1296 ) which threatened with excommunication kings who taxed the clergy without papal consent . Edward 's response was to outlaw clergy who refused to pay such taxes . Philip IV of France , who had also embarked on a policy of taxing his clergy to help pay for his wars , prohibited the export of all money from France . Boniface thereupon was forced to withdraw his bull . Another papal grievance was Edward 's statute which forbade grants of land to the church without the king 's consent . By this statute and another which forbade further subinfeudation , Edward secured greater control of the English landholding system . The wars upon which he expended vast sums were fought to protect his lands in France and to make himself ruler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the Prince of Wales provided the senti- ment for Welsh loyalty which developed in the course of the next hundred years . Two wars were fought in Scotland , and although Edward did not succeed in subduing the Scots he carried off the famous stone of Scone for the English coronation chair . During the barons ' war Simon de Montfort had summoned to the great council , which was beginning to be called parliament , two knights from each shire and two burgesses from each borough to sit with the feudal magnates . Edward followed this plan when in 1295 he called the parliament which became the model for succeeding parliaments . Edward 's model parliament consisted of four houses , which later were to be reduced to two : the feudal magnates both lay and ecclesiastical , representatives of the lower clergy , knights from the shires , and burgesses from the towns . He quoted the Roman law , " What touches all should be approved by all . " With the growth of the towns , their wealth could not be disregarded by a monarch who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected to guarantee the townsfolk 's payment of the taxes voted . Assemblies of this sort were not uniquely English ; Frederick II had called them in Sicily , and they were to be found in the Spainsh kingdoms , in France , Germany , and Bohemia . In 1302 Philip IV of France convened such an assembly for the purpose of demonstrating that his subjects were solidly behind him in his quarrel with Boniface VIII over taxation of the clergy . The . discord between Philip IV and Boniface VIII broke out again after Philip tried a French bishop in a secular court . A notable exchange of abusive letters followed and Boniface finally issued the bull Unam sanctam , in which he claimed that " it is altogether necessary to salvation for every human creature to be subject to the Roman pontiff . " Under the threat of excommunication , Philip sent agents to seize the pope at Anagni , ( 1303 ) and they used insulting behavior toward him . The aged pope died under the strain of his treatment , and Philip secured the election of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in southern France the official papal residence , and thus in 1305 , three years after Dante 's exile , began the so-called Babylonian captivity of the papacy , which lasted for 73 years . By their patronage of art the popes made Avignon a center of artistic activity . The new Flemish painting in oils , to which Burgundian dukes were giving their patronage , and  | a new French school of art were also encouraged by the Avignon popes . While the popes were enjoying life in Avignon , Dante was eating out his heart in exile and writing the series of works which are so remarkable a summation of the medieval mind . He was one of the writers who believed in the future of the Italian language , and although he wrote his scholarly books in Latin , his poetry was in the vernacular , and this contributed greatly toward making his native Tuscan the predominant dialect of Italy . The prose and poetry of his Vita Nuova dealt with romantic love ; the great poem of his maturity , The Divine Comedy , was written to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ways prescribed by the church . In it is to be found the final synthesis of traditional thought and faith . As a scholar who remained a layman , and a poet who used the vernacular for his great poem so that all could read it , Dante was a modern . He was a man of his age in the subject of the poem and its treatment ; he showed the life after death as his age conceived it , in a universe as his world accepted it from the second-century Greek Ptolemy . It had met the tests of the best astronomical observation then possible , and been checked by scripture as expounded by the Fathers of the Church . Dante 's doctrine was the orthodox doctrine which Thomas Aquinas had built upon the authority of the medievalized Aristotle . Whereas in his great epic Dante showed his views of the theology of the day , in his De Monarchia he set forth the political theory that the events through which he lived had developed . He put his faith in the Ghibelline solution for Italy 's ills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule . After the breakdown of imperial power with the death of the last Hohenstaufen emperor no generally recognized emperor had existed for a score of years . When Dante was a boy the Great Interregnum , as this period was called , had come to an end with the election of the head of an unknown Alsatian family , Rudolph of Hapsburg , to the imperial title . Rudolph 's chief preoccupation was the establishment of his family as a great landed power ; when his vassal , the king of Bohemia , failed to meet his feudal obligations , Rudolph declared his fiefs forfeit and annexed them , thereby obtaining the Austrian lands the house of Hapsburg was to rule until the end of World War I. Rudolph gave  | up imperial claims in southern Italy , and under his successor three Alpine cantons revolted and formed the Swiss confederacy . In 1308 , however , a Luxemburger , Henry VII , became emperor and , hoping to revive imperial power in Italy , crossed the Alps , took several towns , and was crowned at Rome . Dante @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the expedition meant only continued civil and ecclesiastical strife . While Dante recorded the spirit and achievement of the world in which he had grown up , a friend of his youth , the painter Giotto , was starting a new movement in art which stemmed from the return to naturalism and simplicity of St. Francis of Assisi . The only authentic portrait of Dante as a young man was painted by Giotto , who knew him well . A master of the formalism and allegory in which Byzantine tradition had long imprisoned painting , Giotto mingled with it a movement and drama which gave his paintings realism . Already in the days of Frederick II a sculptor who found in a late Roman sarcophagus the inspiration to follow nature more realistically had settled in Pisa , whence he received the name Niccolo Pisano . Giotto may , or may not , have been influenced by the work of Niccolo and his nephew Giovanni ; he was definitely inspired by the gentle Francis , who had preached to the birds and called fire and water his sisters . Dante 's world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the claims of Pope Boniface VIII . It saw the transfer of the papal seat to Avignon , and the renewal of the imperial title by a new dynasty in the person of Rudolf of Hapsburg . It saw Edward I renew and vindicate the claim of Henry II to rule throughout the British Isles . The summoning of the third estate to the great council of the realm in several countries shows that in power , though not in prestige , the moneyed class was overtaking the landed class .  | Innocent the bishop , &c.,; to the Bishops of London , Ely , and Worcester , greeting and apostolic blessing . We reply to your inquiries , that whereas by reason of the interdict new chrism can not be consecrated on Maundy Thursday , old must be used in the baptism of infants , and , if necessity demand , oil must be mixed by hand of the bishop or else priest , with the chrism , that it fail not .

Let religious men , whose monasteries people have been wont to visit for the sake of prayer , admit pilgrims inside the church for prayer , not by the greater door , but by a more secret place . Let church doors remain shut save at the chief festival of the church , when the parishioners and others may be admitted for prayer into the church with open doors .

Priests may say their own hours and prayers in private . Priests may on Sunday bless water in the churchyard and sprinkle it ; and can make and distribute the bread when blessed , and announce feasts and fasts and preach a sermon to the people . A woman after childbirth may come to church , and perform her purification outside the church walls . Priests shall visit the sick , and hear confessions , and let them perform the commendation of souls in the accustomed manner , but they shall not follow the corpses of the dead , because they will not have church burial .

See in what manner God gave it to me , to me , Brother Francis , . to begin to do penitence ; when I lived in sin , it was very painful to . me to see lepers , but God himself led me into their midst , and I remained here a little while . When I left them , that which had ' seemed to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after I had quitted the world , and God gave me such a faith in his churches that I would kneel down with simplicity and I would say : " We adore thee , Lord Jesus Christ , here and in all thy churches which are in the world , and we bless thee that by thy holy cross thou hast ransomed the world . " Besides , the Lord gave me and still gives me so great a faith in priests who live according to the form of the holy Roman Church , , because of their sacerdotal character , that even if they persecuted me I would have recourse to them . And even if I had all the wisdom , of Solomon , if I should find poor secular priests , I would not preach  | in their parishes without their consent . I desire to respect them like all the others , to love them and honor them as my lords . I will not consider their sins , for in them I see the Son of God and they are my lords .

I desire above all things to honor and venerate all these most holy mysteries and to keep them precious . Whenever I find the sacred names of Jesus or his words in indecent places , I desire to take them away , and I pray that others take them away and put them in some decent place . We ought to honor and revere all the theologians and those who preach the most holy word of God , as dispensing to us spirit and life . When the Lord gave me some brothers no one showed me what I ought to do , but the most High himself revealed to me that I ought to live according to the model of the holy gospel .

Salimbene was a Franciscan friar , a native of Parma ( 1221-88 ) , from whose Autobiography , as quoted by Mr. Coulton , the following extracts are taken . His description of Frederick 's personal characteristics , and of his scientific experiments , form the principal basis of the accounts given by modern historians of this extraordinary personage . The sketch of St. Louis , and of the feast he offered the monks , is full of interesting detail . These samples show that the Autobiography as a whole is well worth reading for a picture of the thirteenth century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was crafty , wily , avaricious , lustful , malicious , wrathful ; and yet a gallant man at times , when he would show his kindness or courtesy ; full of solace , jocund , delightful , fertile in devices . He knew to read , write , and sing , and to  | make songs and music . He was a comely man , and well-formed , but of middle stature . I have seen him , and once I loved him , for on my behalf he wrote to Brother Elias , Minister-General of the Friars Minor , to send me back to my father . Moreover , he knew to speak with many and varied tongues , and , to be brief , if he had been rightly Catholic , and had loved God and His Church , he would have had few emperors his equals in the world . Bidding foster-mothers and nurses to suckle and bathe and wash the children , but in no wise to prattle or speak with them ; for he would have learnt whether they would speak the Hebrew language ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Latin , or Arabic , or perchance the tongue of their parents of whom they had been born . But he laboured in vain , for the children could not live without clappings of the hands , and gestures , and gladness of countenance , and blandishments . . . . When he saw the Holy Land , ( which God had so oft-times commended as a land flowing with milk and honey and most excellent above all lands , ) it pleased him not , and he said that if the God of the Jews had seen his lands of Terra di Lavoro , Calabria , Sicily , and Apulia , then He would not so have commended the land which He promised to the Jews . But Ecclesiasticus saith : " Speak nothing rashly , nor let thy heart be swift to utter thy speech before God : for God is in the heaven , and thou upon earth ; wherefore let thy words be few . " Take an example of that clerk who uttered against God such words as should not have been said : wherefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fell dead . His fourth excess was that he oft-times sent one Nicholas against his will to the bottom of the Faro , and oft-times he returned thence ; and , wishing to know in sooth whether he had indeed gone down to the bottom and returned thence , he threw in his golden cup where he thought the depth was greatest . So Nicholas plunged and found it and brought it back , whereat the Emperor marvelled . But when he would have sent him again , he said : " Send me not thither , I pray you ; for the sea is so troubled in the depth that , if ye send me , I shall never return . " Nevertheless the Emperor sent him ; so there he perished and never returned : for in those sea-depths are great fishes at times of tempests , and rocks and many wrecks of ships ; as he himself reported . He might have said to Frederick in Jonah 's words " Thou hast cast me into the deep , in the heart of the sea , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waves went over me . " . . . Moreover , Frederick had likewise other excesses and curiosities and cursed ways and incredulities , whereof I have written some in another chronicle : as of the man whom he shut up alive in a cask until he died therein , wishing thereby to show that the soul perished utterly , as if he might say the word of Isaiah " Let us eat and drink , for to-morrow we die . " For he was an Epicurean ; wherefore , partly of himself and partly through his wise men , he sought out all that he could find in Holy Scripture which might make for the proof that there was no other life after death , as for instance " Thou shalt destroy them , and not build them up " : and again " Their sepulchres shall be their houses for ever " also Ps. xxxviii. 14 , Ecclus. xlviii . 12 , Ps. cvi. 5 , Eccl . I9-22 , and many such , which Solomon said in Ecclesiastes in the person of carnal folk : . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one of whom he sent forthwith to sleep , and the other to hunt ; and that same evening he caused them to be disembowelled in his presence , wishing to know which had digested the better : and it was judged by the physicians in favour of him who had slept . Seventhly and lastly , being one day in his palace , he asked of Michael Scot the astrologer how far he was from the sky , and Michael having answered as it seemed to him , the Emperor took him to other parts of his kingdom as if for a journey of pleasure , and kept him there several months , bidding meanwhile his architects and carpenters secretly to lower the whole of his palace hall . Many days afterwards , standing in that same palace with Michael , he asked of him , as if by the way , whether he were indeed so far from the sky as he had before said . Whereupon he made his calculations , and made answer that certainly either the sky had been raised or the earth lowered ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was wont at times to make mocking harangues before his court in his own palace , speaking for example after the fashion of the Cremonese ambassadors , who were sent to him by their fellowcitizens ; one of whom would begin by praising the other with manifold words of commendation , saying " This lord my fellow is noble , wise , rich , and powerful " : and so after commending each other the ambassadors would at last come to their proper business . Moreover , he would suffer patiently the scoffings and mockings and revilings of jesters , and often feign that he heard not . For one day , after the destruction of Victoria by the men of Parma , he smote his hand on the hump of a certain jester , saying " My Lord Dallio , when shall this box be opened ? " To whom the other answered , " ' T is  | odds if it be ever opened now , for I lost the key in Victoria . " The Emperor , hearing how this jester recalled his own sorrow and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I was troubled , and I spoke not . " If any had spoken such a jest against Ezzelino da Romano , he would without doubt have let him be blinded or hanged . Again , another time he suffered patiently that Villano da Ferro mocked him at the siege of Berceto ; for the Emperor asked him how men named the mangonels and catapults which were there , and Villano gave him for their names certain mocking words , namely " sbegna " and " sbegnoino . " But the Emperor did but smile and turn away ... . One day , when he was excommunicated by Pope Gregory IX and had come to certain parts where was the Patriarch of Aquileia , the Lord Berthold , whom I have seen and known , a comely man and uncle to St. Elizabeth of Hungary , ? then the Emperor sent word to him to come and hear Mass with him . But the Patriarch , knowing all this , called his barber and caused himself to be bled before he had seen the Emperor 's messenger ; then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Emperor that he could not go and hear Mass with him , since he had been bled and was set down to meat . So the Emperor sent a second time , bidding him come forthwith , all impediments notwithstanding : whereupon , willing to redeem his vexation , he humbly obeyed , and came and heard Mass with him . Now the King was spare and slender , somewhat lean , and of a proper height , having the face of an angel , and mien full of grace . And he came to our Church , not in regal pomp , but in a pilgrim 's habit , with the staff and the scrip of his pilgrimage hanging at his neck , which was an excellent adornment for the shoulders of a king . And he came not on horseback , but on foot ; and his bloodbrethren , who were three counts , ( whereof the eldest was named Robert , and the youngest Charles , who did afterwards many great deeds most worthy of praise ) , followed him in the same humble guise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the prophet " Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help , trusting in horses , and putting their confidence in chariots , because they are many , and in horsemen , because they are very strong : and have not trusted in the holy One of Israel , and have not sought after the Lord . " Nor did the King care for a train of nobles , but rather for the prayers and suffrages of the poor ; and therefore he fulfilled that which  | Ecclesiasticus teacheth " Make thyself affable to the congregation of the poor . " In truth he might rather be called a monk in devotion of heart , than a knight in weapons of war ... . ... Moreover , the King took upon himself all that day 's cost , and ate together with us in the refectory ; and with us sat down to meat the King 's three brethren , and the Cardinal , and the MinisterGeneral , and Brother Rigaud , Archbishop of Rouen , and the Minister-Provincial of France , and the Custodes and Definitores , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capitular body , and the Brethren our guests , whom we call " foreigners . " . . . This then was our fare that day : first , cherries , then most excellent white bread ; and choice wine , worthy of the King 's royal state , was placed in abundance before us ; and , after the wont of the French , many invited even the unwilling and compelled them to drink . After that we had fresh beans boiled in milk , fishes and crabs , eel-pasties , rice cooked with milk of almonds and cinnamon powder , eels baked with most excellent sauce , tarts and junkets , or curd-cheeses and all the fruits of the season in abundance and comely array . And all these were laid on the table in courtly fashion , and busily ministered to us ....

The Divine Comedy deals with the fate of souls after death . In the first book , the Inferno , Dante , under the guidance of the poet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond redemption were suffering . In the second circle he saw whirled about by contrary winds souls which had yielded to the temptation of forbidden love . Dido was one of these , and a famous pair , Francesca da Rimini and her lover Paolo . " O living creature , gracious and benign ! that goest through the black air , visiting us who stained the earth with blood . If the King of the Universe were our friend , we would pray him for thy peace ; seeing that thou halt pity of our perverse misfortune . Of that which it pleases thee to hear and to speak , we will hear and speak with you , whilst the wind , as now , is silent . " The town where I was born , sits on the shore , where Po descends to rest with his attendant streams .

Love , which to no loved one permits excuse from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that , as thou seest , even now it leaves me not . Love led us to one death . Caina waits for him who quenched our life . " These words from them were offered to us . After I had heard those wounded souls , I bowed my face , and held it low until the poet said to me : " What art thou thinking of ? " When I answered , I began : " Ah me ! what sweet thoughts , what longing led them to the woful pass ! " Then I turned again to them ; and I spoke , and began : " Francesca , thy torments make me weep with grief and pity . But tell me :  | in the time of the sweet sighs , by what and how love granted you to know the dubious desires ! " And she to me : " There is no greater pain than to recall a happy time in wretchedness ; and this thy teacher knows . But if thou bast such desire to learn the first root of our love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " One day , for pastime , we read of Lancelot , how love constrained him .

That day we read in it no farther . " In the third chasm of the eighth circle those who practiced simony were being punished . They were placed head downwards in holes of the rock , and flames played upon the soles of their feet . Dante finds that the sufferer who showed the greatest agony was Pope Nicholas III .

Then Virgil said : " Say to him quickly , I am not he , I am not he whom thou thinkest . ' " And I replied as was enjoined me . Whereat the spirit quite wrenched his feet ; Thereafter , sighing and with voice of weeping , he said to me : " Then what askest thou of me ?

This was partly cloaked by the rise of chivalry which had been growing for centuries and reached its height at this time . Chivalry accented the international character of feudalism . In its origins it had owed much to the efforts of the church to idealize the knight as the servant of God , the protector of the weak . It was indebted also to the Arab code of behavior with which westerners came in touch on the Spanish border and during the crusades . At its core were the feudal virtues : valor , prowess , loyalty , open-heartedness . With the aid of the minstrels the ladies developed the code of courtly love . According to the code , a knight 's prowess was increased by devotion to a lady . In order to win her approval he must be proficient in the courtly arts . The Book of the Knight of La Tour Landry and the Chronicles of Froissart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By that time the brutal exercise of the tournament had become a spectacle where the ladies watched their knights , in heavy armor , trying with blunted weapons to unhorse each other . Courtly love and the idealization of women had already provoked the church to a counter movement in the cult of the Virgin . With the waning importance of the knight in war the mock combat of the tournament became his serious occupation . As a landed proprietor , with peasants at his disposal , he had a solid base for his prestige . Its demise was slow , and the chivalric code was to rule polite society for centuries , to be studied eagerly by even the townsmen 's sons who were not to the manor born but who were coming of age as the heirs to the landed proprietor 's dominant position in society .  | Townsmen were continuing to make history . Even before the thirteenth century , leagues of cities , such as the Lombard League in Italy , had been in existence mainly for political purposes . In the fourteenth century the Hanseatic League @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Baltic trade lanes , virtually controlled the trade of the north . The Order of Teutonic Knights , which had profited by the German colonization and town-building in the Baltic area in the conquest of the Prussians , encouraged the colonization of Poland and Lithuania . This German invasion was opposed by the Polish king , who was a town-builder himself and had established the new capital of Cracow . He lost Pomerania to the Teutonic Knights , but his successor formed an alliance with the Grand-Duke of Lithuania . He encouraged the activities of the Jews and founded the University of Cracow . He was succeeded by a cadet of the house of Anjou , who although he increased the power of the nobles , was also a patron of the townsmen . The opposition of the Poles and Lithuanians finally resulted in Poland 's winning West Prussia , with Danzig , its great Baltic port . German colonization was successful in Bohemia , which came under rulers of German blood , and important town populations grew up . The second German king , who was also emperor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city of Moscow became important when the princes of the Moscow region were able to impress their importance on their Mongol overlords and even defeat them on the field of battle . In Hungary Louis the Great , a member of the Angevin house , encouraged cities and trade . Louis won Dalmatia from Venice and had considerable success in the Balkans , but was beaten in Serbia by the national hero , Stephen Dushan . The Serbians had developed an interesting culture on the Greek model . Stephen created a great Serbian empire and planned to succeed the Byzantine emperors , but after his death the Serbs were defeated by the newest invaders of southeastern Europe , the Ottoman Turks , on the field of Kossovo ( 1389 ) and Serbia became a vassal state . The tradition of this great age and leader remained as the kernel about which the spirit of Serbian nationality was to grow in later centuries . National consciousness in England and France was developing as a result of the Hundred Years ' War between the two countries , which began toward the middle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had adopted the English language to replace  | French as fashionable speech , and as the century went on English soldiers led to battle by an English king longed for familiar food and talk in an alien land . At the same time soil trodden by plundering invaders became sacred to the French . New vernacular literatures enhanced these national sentiments . In German lands the imperial title lapsed , and local loyalties developed in the cities , but the homogeneous nature of the German population provided a common fund of tastes and traditions , and these were kept alive by the minnesingers and meistersingers . As the Germans pushed eastward , the Slav with his strange habits was the foreign danger , the opponent in their search for new homes . Common opposition to the Slav stimulated a feeling of German solidarity . In Italy city loyalties had never disappeared , and they became more intense with urban rivalries and struggles for the intervening countryside among the city-states . The tradition of descent from the ancient Romans provided a rallying point for Italian nationality but the tradition expressed itself chiefly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sons of rich merchants for reading matter which dealt with this world rather than - the next was supplied in the vernacular by Boccaccio 's Decameron ; for the learned , in the works of classical authors . It became fashionable to ape the ancient Romans ' tastes and hobbies , and a few specimens of ancient sculpture provided inspiration for artists . The subject matter of art on the whole was still religious , but potent forces in society were aiding secular interests in the field of faith . A new movement in secular music , known as ars nova , became popular in Italy , France , and the Netherlands , providing settings for Dante 's and Petrarch 's sonnets and the stories of Boccaccio . It was polyphonic , included elaborate instrumental accompaniment , and its spirit was romantic . The fourteenth century was also notable for inventions . In general there was evident a quickening in the tempo of European life which was the fruit of many generations of progress in developing the medieval counterpart of modern science and technology . The significance of many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the feudal ages becomes evident only over long periods . Devices already in use ? such as mechanical clocks and looms ? were perfected . When windmills and watermills were adapted to the principle of the crank in changing one type of action to another , non-human power development took further great  | strides . Modern mechanical genius has built on the same foundations . The agricultural revolution of the Middle Ages was completed in the fourteenth century , and the European population level became more or less stationary until the next great agricultural revolution beginning in the eighteenth century . Certain revolutionary social forces were also at work during the fourteenth century . The papacy at Anagni was fallen from the high estate to which Innocent III had raised it , and at Avignon it fell still further . In the last quarter of the century the rivalry over the papal office which led to the division known as the Great Schism gave papal prestige a yet more resounding blow . In an age when townsmen were feeling their importance and peasants had more bargaining power as a result of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1348-50 ) , the Avignon popes , with an improved machinery for collection , increased their financial demands . A population irked by the tax Peter 's Pence and by papal provisions furnished an excellent breeding ground for heresy ; and John Wycliffe started a movement in England whose repercussions are still heard .  | JOHN WYCLIFFE , a Yorkshireman , was born some nine years after Dante 's death . About the early part of his life there is controversy ; that he first studied and then taught at Oxford is certain . He may have been a member of the Parliament of 1366 which refused to pay the tribute money due the papacy as a consequence of King John 's homage and fealty to Innocent III . The men and women of his world were those of whom his contemporary , Geoffrey Chaucer , has given a vivid picture in the prologue to his Canterbury Tales . The prototype of Chaucer 's " Clerk of Oxenford " rubbed shoulders in Oxford lanes with the young men Wycliffe trained year after year to go out as " poor preachers " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the decay of preaching had left men ignorant of the faith . Wycliffe himself had many of the qualities of Chaucer 's parish priest ; he was , however , more fiery than meek . He had a pleasant wit and a firm determination to stand fast against abuses prevalent among the clergy and against what he believed to be false doctrine . When he was still a boy , his sovereign became involved in t he great struggle with France which was to absorb much of English energies for several generations and has come to be known as the Hundred Years ' War . This war was as inevitable as most wars appear to be in retrospect . Significant for the history of Europe in the fourteenth century are the facts that both English and French monarchies had simultaneously achieved a rather high degree of order and stability under strong monarchs , and that their territories were contiguous . The successors of Philip the Fair were becoming aware of the possibilities of the natural frontiers of France . Blocking expansion toward one  | of them ? the Pyrenees ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of England , an embarrassingly powerful vassal . The profitable trade which the English enjoyed with southern France through the port of Bordeaux was a constant source of irritation and jealousy on the part of the French . The English , on the other hand , were no more pleased that their strong sovereign was a vassal of the French crown . While the question of Aquitaine was a long-standing cause of the conflict between the two monarchies which had been going on sporadically since King John lost Normandy , the immediate occasion of the war was the problem of Flanders . The Flemish weavers in the prosperous lowland towns were the principal purchasers of English wool . Discrimination against English merchants and wool by the count of Flanders led to an uprising of the Flemings in which the count was expelled . The count of Flanders was a vassal of the king of France , and when the latter attempted to reinstate him the Flemish rebels appealed to the English . The Avignon papacy , usually sensitive to the desires of the French kings , imposed a fine on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thereupon Edward III of England was persuaded to put forward his claim to be the lawful ruler of France in order to release his Flemish friends from the papal charge of rebellion . Edward 's claim to the throne of France was purely a diplomatic move ; rivalry over fishing grounds had long existed between French and English sailors in the English Channel and the North Sea and actual hostilities had broken out . When Edward III quartered the lilies of France on his shield and set out to conquer his inheritance , he was reviving a very doubtful right . His father Edward II had married a daughter of Philip the Fair of France . Philip 's three sons ruled successively and all died without direct male heirs , leaving the French the choice of accepting descent through a female or shifting to a collateral branch of the royal family and choosing Philip of Valois , a nephew of Philip the Fair . Philip of Valois was selected , and Edward III recognized him as king of France and did homage for his French fiefs . When the Flemish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and argued his claim to the French throne through Philip the Fair 's daughter . When the French king assembled a fleet to sweep the English sailors from the disputed seas , Edward caught the French fleet in the harbor of Sluys and  | destroyed it ( 1340 ) . The English king thus had the initial advantage of control of the seas , and prepared to invade France . Edward could count on the support of every important class in England . The clergy were resentful of the influence the French were presumed to have over the papacy at Avignon , the merchants wished their trade with Flanders and Aquitaine secured , the yeomen ( small landowners ) profited from having the Flemish market open to English wool , and the feudal knights and barons looked forward to a fine field for adventure and ransom-collecting . Edward furthermore had the rudiments of a royal and national army , thanks to his predecessors ' foresighted policy of commuting feudal military service to money payment , and it was an army equipped with a distinctively English weapon ? the longbow . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Scots and developed suitable tactics to go with it . Archery was a national pastime in England , and the English yeoman was the master of his weapon through practice from boyhood . The longbow had a range of about three hundred yards , and could pierce armor at one hundred ; it had a tremendous advantage over the crossbow as a missile weapon because of the rapid fire that could be maintained . The successful tactics developed by the English required close co-ordination between knights and archers ; the former were dismounted and placed in the center to invite the charge of the feudal cavalry , with the yeoman along the flanks to pour their deadly hail of arrows into the advancing enemy ranks . The English invaders won a spectacular success when Edward met a French force at the battle of Crecy ( 1346 ) . The havoc wrought by the longbow was almost incredible ; French losses ran into many thousands , including several hundred knights , while the English casualties numbered two or three score . The celebrated French chronicler , Froissart , a devout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Crecy , tells how the English went on to capture the port of Calais , and then relates the second and equally overwhelming success of the longbow at Poitiers , when the capture of the French king paved the way for the treaty of Bretigny in 1360 . Edward was granted full sovereignty over his French possessions . Less picturesque records than Froissart 's chronicle tell of the devastating effects of the Black Death , the epidemic of bubonic  | plague which ravaged Europe in 1348-50 , killing more than a third of the population in England , ruining the nascent cloth industry , and producing a labor shortage which led workers to demand higher wages . Parliament enacted a price control and maximum wage act ( Statute of Laborers ) , but it proved unenforceable , and landowners began to enclose their fields for sheep-raising , which required fewer laborers . The Black Death in Italy was described in a well known book . Readers of Boccaccio will remember that he represents the gallants and ladies of his Decameron meeting in a church of Florence and going thence to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Black Death raged in Florence . The Decameron belonged to the movement to use the vernacular which Dante started when he wrote The Divine Comedy in the Tuscan dialect . Boccaccio 's friend , Petrarch , who was a lad of seventeen when Dante died , contributed to the movement poetry in the sonnet form . Petrarch , however , developed an interest in Latin literature which he shared with Boccaccio , and both men came to regard their work in the vernacular as much less important than the revival of the Roman cult of humanitas , that is , admiration of the literature of the Greeks , and collection of their writings , works of art , gems , and coins . Petrarch wrote letters to dead authors in a Latin he hoped was Ciceronian , and fired his followers with enthusiasm for finding manuscripts of Greek and Latin authors that lay neglected in monastery libraries . Chaucer , journeying to Italy , seems to have met Petrarch ; the Englishman borrowed Petrarch 's poetical devices and Boccaccio 's diverting stories , but the movement of humanism was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the English proceeded along traditional lines . At Oxford , where the Franciscans were leaders in scholarship , the inquisitive Roger Bacon was followed in Wycliffe 's time by the invincible debater , William of Occam , a nominalist . William of Occam declared the church was a man-made institution ; that the pope could err and should be corrected by laymen . He went further and denounced the whole doctrine of an ordered universe of which the papacy for centuries had been the recognized guardian . He denounced the wealth and corruption of the clergy . The second Avignon pope , John XXII , got into a quarrel with the Franciscans , and some of them , including William of Occam ,  | sought refuge at the court of the Emperor , Louis the Bavarian , who had refused to recognize the election of John . Refugee scholars were utilized to write attacks upon papal claims . The most famous pamphlet to issue from the group was Marsiglio of Padua 's Defensor Pacis , which revived the classical theory that the original source of governmental power is the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Marsiglio claimed that authority in the church resided in the people and was exercised through general councils , and that the pope was chosen by the clergy as their head for ecclesiastical purposes only and had no temporal power . A number of years later arguments to the same end , though based on different premises , were uttered by Wycliffe in his crowded lecture room in Oxford and were applauded . English society in the latter half of the fourteenth century had been profoundly changed by the war . Wages had risen , war profits had enriched the class that provided war materials and goods formerly imported from France , and the fighters had profited by ransoms and pillage . A strong anti-clerical spirit was growing , for the popes as Frenchmen were under suspicion , the Avignon popes had greatly increased the efficiency of papal machinery for attracting money , and papal provisions ( nominations ) of Frenchmen to English benefices were a growing grievance . Prosperity created a secular atmosphere , and attacks on the Curia were popular . In 1351 parliament passed the Statute of Provisors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and two years later , the Statute of Praemunire , to prohibit ecclesiastical appeals out of the kingdom . Within a few years an English poem , Piers the Plowman , expressed the grievances of the peasants against both state and church , and agitators went about the land preaching social equality . Similar conditions existed in France , where the Black Death had been as calamitous as in England and Italy . John II , a king who was the ideal of chivalric behavior but a great waster of public funds , faced a revolt of the merchants of Paris led by its richest citizen , Etienne Marcel , in 1355 . The king was forced to promise that he would levy no new demands for money without consulting the Estates of the Realm and that he would allow them to direct the expenditure of the money . The following year Edward III 's son , the Black Prince , defeated John at Poitiers and took him and his sons prisoner . During the king 's imprisonment Etienne Marcel attempted  | to establish a parliamentary rule in France by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pushed too fast . The prestige of the monarchy was strong , and Marcel 's reliance on the support of the Parisian mob led to his assassination by his more conservative wealthy colleagues . Ransom raising and war taxation added to the burdens of the people already hard-pressed by pillage and the losses of the Black Death , and caused a peasant rebellion ( Jacquerie ) . Shortly after the English claims to Calais and southwestern France were recognized in the treaty of Bretigny , the duchy of Burgundy reverted to the French crown , but instead of being added to the royal domain it was granted to one of the king 's sons . His marriage to the heiress of the count of Flanders made Burgundy a formidable fief for the king of France , and later marriages added lands in the Low Countries ( Netherlands ) to the Burgundian holdings . Charles V ( The Wise ) succeeded his father as king of France in 1364 and shrewdly regained financial control from the Estates General . Besides strengthening the administration he reorganized the army and navy . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lacked any fine chivalric notions . His lack of chivalric nonsense was shared by Bertrand du Guesclin , whom Charles made Constable ( commander-in-chief ) . Much military progress was made under Bertrand by the use of guerilla tactics against the English , and as the French navy was able to cut off English supplies , the English forces were driven out of France , except for a few ports on the English Channel . During the last decades of the fourteenth century activity in the Hundred Years ' War lagged ; more pressing affairs created a distraction . In 1377 Edward III died , and his neurotic grandson Richard II became king ; and since Richard was not of age , his uncle , John of Gaunt , Duke of Lancaster , governed in his name , with the assistance of parliament . In 138o Charles VI succeeded his father as king of France , and as he was subject to fits of insanity , France was ruled by his uncles , under whom the country fell into disorder that led to civil war . When an Avignon pope who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papacy entered a period of crisis . The Romans elected an Italian to succeed him , but the cardinals at Avignon elected another French pope ; and as each pope had supporters , the Great Schism was created which lasted into the next century . With two men claiming to be pope , Christendom was in evil case .  | The subject of papal provisions was frequently discussed in England ; Wycliffe lectured in Oxford and preached in London against the temporal power of the clergy and violently denounced the Great Schism . Wycliffe 's ideas were politically useful to John of Gaunt , who protected the preacher when the clerical party the duke opposed brought Wycliffe to trial for preaching the ideas of Marsiglio of Padua and other opponents of the papacy . The trial came to nothing , and Wycliffe 's ideas progressed from one position to another in the direction of heresy . At this time he began sending out his poor priests to preach the faith , and embarked upon his translation of the Bible . John of Gaunt was not troubled about Wycliffe 's idea that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God , but when Wycliffe began to deny that the sacraments were essential and to question transubstantiation , the duke withdrew his support . Wycliffe was again cited for trial as a heretic in 1381 , the year of the Peasants ' Revolt . There had been extensive emancipation of the peasants in England from feudal dues because the lords had found paid free labor more efficient . Unable , however , to keep wages down following the Black Death , the nobles tried to compel the peasants to go back to performing services for their holdings instead of paying money as rent . Since commutation of services for money payments had been going on for generations , wide dissatisfaction ensued . Enactment of a poll tax was another grievance , and peasants began rioting and attacking castles in order to burn the old records . A formidable number marched on London , but the young king tricked the leaders into submission and hanged them ; the remaining peasants dispersed to their homes , where the nobles were permitted to wreak a bloody vengeance . Wycliffe 's poor preachers , known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the rising . His trial led to his withdrawal to his parish , but no further action was taken against him , and he died in peace at Lutterworth . His ideas had spread among all classes , and were carried into Bohemia by some of the Czechs who had come to England for the marriage of Anne of Bohemia to King Richard II . There they were to work a ferment in the mind of a Czech professor , John Huss , who became a notable martyr in the next century . College professors now and then make history . The world of Wycliffe was one in which many currents of  | thought were abroad . Wycliffe 's fellow-countryman , Geoffrey Chaucer , some ten years his junior , enriched English style and left unforgettable pictures of the life of the people of the fourteenth century . Petrarch and Boccaccio had inaugurated a classical revival in Italy before they died , a few years before Wycliffe 's first attack upon papal provisions ( c. 1376 ) . The Great Schism of the papacy left a legacy of trouble to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For the most part the fourteenth century bequeathed problems of destruction to the fifteenth , for much of the Hundred Years ' War remained to be fought . A constructive feature in England , however , was the custom , which became permanent during the Hundred Years ' War , of summoning knights and burgesses to attend the Great Council of the Realm . They developed the habit of deliberating together , apart from the bishops and peers , and a parliament of two houses was beginning to form rules and establish precedents which gave it an important place in English life .  | This bull admirably illustrates the attitude of the papacy toward heresy . Note that the tares are not to be allowed to grow along with the wheat until the harvest . The connection made between Wycliffe 's ideas and those of the Defensor Pacis is significant . Wycliffe 's answer to the summons of a later pope shows his dauntless spirit . Gregory , bishop , servant of the servants of God , to his beloved sons the chancellor and University of Oxford , in the diocese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compelled to wonder and grieve that you , who , in consideration of the favors and privileges conceded to your university of Oxford by the apostolic see , and on account of your familiarity with the Scriptures , in whose sea you navigate , by the gift of God , with auspicious oar , you , who ought to be , as it were , warriors and champions of the orthodox faith , without which there is no salvation of souls , ? that you through a certain sloth and neglect allow tares to spring up amidst the pure wheat in the fields of your glorious university aforesaid ; and what is still more pernicious , even continue to grow to maturity .

By the insinuation of many , if they are indeed worthy of belief , deploring it deeply , it has come to our ears that John de Wycliffe , rector of the church of Lutterworth , in the diocese of Lincoln , Professor of the Sacred Scriptures , ( would that he were not also Master of Errors , ) has fallen into such a detestable madness that he does not hesitate to dogmatize and publicly preach , or rather vomit forth from the recesses of his breast certain propositions and conclusions which are erroneous and false . He has cast himself also into the depravity of preaching heretical dogmas which strive to subvert and weaken the state of the whole church and even secular polity , some of which doctrines , in changed terms , it is true , seem to express the perverse opinions and unlearned learning of Marsilio of Padua of cursed memory , and of John of Jandun , whose book is extant , rejected and cursed by our predecessor , Pope John XXII , of happy memory .

I suppose over this that the gospel of Christ be heart of the corps of God 's law ; for I believe that Jesus Christ , that gave in his own person this gospel , is very God and very man , and by this heart passes all other laws .

And Paul says that he was made needy for our love . And more poor might no man be , neither bodily nor in spirit . And thus Christ put from him all manner of worldly lordship . For the gospel of John telleth that when they would have made Christ king , he fled and hid him from them , for he would none such worldly highness . And over this I take it as believe , that no man should follow the Pope , nor no saint that is now in heaven , but in as much as he * From University of Pennsylvania , Translations and Reprints , II , No. 5 .

And this I take as wholesome counsel , that the Pope leave his worldly lordship to worldly lords , as Christ gave them , ? and move speedily all his clerks to do so . For thus did Christ , and taught thus his disciples , till the fiend had blinded this world . And it seems to some men that clerks that dwell lastingly in this error against God 's law , and flee to follow Christ in this , been open heretics , and their fautors been partners . And if I err in this sentence , I will meekly be amended , yea , by the death , if it be skilful , for that I hope were good to me .

For our belief teaches us that our blessed God suffers us not to be tempted more than we may ; how should a man ask such service ?

The rigid framework of the three estates was giving way : and a member of the third estate , if he were a merchant and sufficiently rich , might play the part of a great noble . The noble had justified his dominance by his defense of the people , but the triumph of the archer in the Hundred Year 's War had invalidated his claim . When in the course of the fifteenth century artillery could batter down the feudal stronghold , where formerly a noble 's peasants could find refuge , his social value was gone . His ability to survive now depended upon his firm hold on the land and those who tilled it . Kings , henceforth dependent on mercenary troops in war rather than feudal levies , turned to those who had money for funds to pay soldiers .

The great prosperity of the Italian city states focused attention on Italy . These city states inaugurated a political device of great importance and of special interest today . Weary of the warfare caused by interurban rivalries , Italian towns began forming leagues in the interest of peace on a federative principle . With the French invasions of Italy which began at the end of the fifteenth century they became organizations of defense . The rulers of England , France , and Spain were not slow to borrow this idea of leagues which , adorned by  | high-sounding phrases , such as Holy League , might be used to further aims of national aggrandizement . The municipal institutions of the medieval city state had , by the fifteenth century , undergone a considerable transformation . Originally the town population of the commercial cities had been made up of free men , that is , men free from the personal dependence that characterized the three primary classes of feudal society . This freedom from feudal intrusions had been maintained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the fifteenth century changes within urban society were producing tyranny . With the great increase of wealth in the towns , a natural differentiation among the citizens occurred : at the top was a very small group of extremely wealthy men , merchants or bankers or both ; next was the middle class whose members made up the craft guilds and managed small scale industries or retail trade ; and at the bottom was the increasing class of wage earners who worked for the other two groups . The government of cities tended toward oligarchy because the wealthiest class , which generally was composed of the most enterprising and most influential members of the population , took the lead in winning charters of independence and self-government for the communes . Since the prosperity of the wealthy class depended on a vast expansion of commerce , efforts were made to break down the monopolistic guild system , and this led the guilds to demand , and frequently obtain , a share in the government . The wage earners resorted to the organization of guilds of their own and demanded a share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the selfgoverning communes of the middle ages , but only representation through a corporation . In the long run the wage earners never succeeded in winning any permanent place in the government beside their richer fellows . This was demonstrated in the fate of such uprisings as the Peasants ' Revolt in England , the Jacquerie in France , and numerous revolts in the towns of Flanders and Germany about the same period . Two trends were at work in urban political life : a recognition of the value of capable leadership by an oligarchy of the wealthy , and an insistence on the democratic principle of individual rights . In any but the most primitive self-government a delegation of rights or powers is necessary to create a functioning organization . The townsmen as a whole , represented through their guilds , were the source of  | authority and theoretically were able to withdraw any powers turned over to the government . Unless the right of popular control is regularly and systematically used , however , it degenerates in practice , especially where , as was true in the highly competitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intervention makes the citizens more interested in an efficient management than in the retention of individual rights ? hence the increasing delegation of power to the very wealthy few , whose self-interest dictated efficiency and order , and then to a despot or tyrant . The despots who developed in Italian communes , usually out of the recurring need for a strong man to take the lead in conflicts with internal or external enemies of the community , concentrated both financial and political control in themselves , and then made the control hereditary . Like the ancient Roman emperors , they relied upon vast spectacles to pacify the citizens for their loss of individual liberty . The fame which ostentatious displays of wealth and its fruits in the form of patronage brought to their cities went far toward reconciling the citizens of the Italian communes to tyranny . It made possible the continued progress in the fine arts and the intellectual activity that goes by the name of the Italian Renaissance . Florence was already in the lead . A whole generation had grown up imbued with the humanism made fashionable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Medici Florentine art was greatly stimulated by public patronage . For many years the Florentines had been carrying on public works in a lavish way , which gave great scope to artistic talent . The sculptor-architect Brunelleschi was vanquished by Ghiberti in a competition of designs for two bronze doors for the Baptistry . Brunelleschi later won the competition for a design for the cathedral dome with an original scheme which did away with the usual supports thought necessary during construction . Although the study of antiquity gave inspiration to these artists , their work was characterizel by the spirit of their own age . Donatello developed a new realism in sculpture characterized by rationalism and restraint that was in harmony with humanism . Through the use of the newly-discovered principles of perspective and a skilful use of light and shade , a Florentine painter , Masaccio , transformed the art of painting by heightening the naturalism that Giotto had introduced . These innovations were the natural development of the progress of preceding centuries .  | Flemish towns contributed to painting the technique of oil as a medium , and methods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burgundy and other magnates , including the Avignon popes , aided these developments by their patronage . From Flanders came also elaborations of music comparable in spirit to the flamboyant Gothic of the new town architecture . In German cities as well as in the Netherlands municipal pride expressed itself in the founding of universities , to which the wandering scholars who flocked to Italy brought back new fashions in learning . Among the Germans there was much progress in metallurgy and the mechanical arts ; the high point was the perfection of the art of printing from movable types . Block printing had long been known and from it developed the arts of wood engraving and , later , copperplate engraving . Leonardo da Vinci , whose career extended into the sixteenth century , exemplified the combination of the thinker capable of dealing with abstractions and the practical inventor . He stated the problems of dynamics and made progress in statics ; at the same time , using his creative imagination , he made a wide range of inventions . It is impossible to say whether all the drawings in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that some , perhaps many , represented devices already in use . Some , like his flyer for spindles , were capable of immediate practical application ; others needed perfecting . On the other side of the picture an increased preoccupation with the devil and his angels produced the revolting excesses of the witch persecutions . The special interest in diabolism at this time has been variously explained as an aftermath of the Black Death , or consequences of the disputations of the schoolmen , or an extension of the repression of heresy . Attempts have been made to prove that the witch persecutions were caused by actual survivals of ancient fertility rites , but the weight of evidence indicates that those who actually practiced witchcraft or sorcery did so for profit or with the hope of injuring their enemies , and that many of the victims were either sufferers from psychic disorders or innocent persons who confessed to escape further torture . The outbreak of persecutions followed the church councils summoned in the first part of the fifteenth century in the hope of ending the Great Schism . The period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by discussions  | about the relative powers of pope and council ? discussions in which arguments were brought forth that were of transcendent importance and which are of great interest today , because the question was one of sovereignty . The councils tried to establish the principle that the authority of a representative assembly of the church was above the undivided authority of the pope . The failure of the movement led to the Reformation and the papacy as it exists today . With the ending of the schism the popes took control , dropped the reform program of the conciliar movement , but pushed heresy hunting by the Inquisition , which was put into the hands of the Dominicans . As witches were considered heretics , the Inquisition was also entrusted with the prosecution of witchcraft . A papal bull directed attention to witchcraft , and two inquisitors published the Malleus Maleficarum , which provided a formula for trials which made the conviction of an accused person a foregone conclusion . In city after city neighbor accused neighbor , and thousands of men , women , boys , and girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were burned at the stake . The madness died down only after accusations spread to the magistrate who enforced the penalties . Witchcraft trials continued , sporadically , into the seventeenth century , spreading even to America . It has been suggested that the activities of the Inquisition may explain the failure of fifteenth-century thinkers to make more progress in investigating natural phenomena . The fifteenth was a barren century in the field of pure science ; it did , however , produce tools which were to promote scientific progress in the next hundred years . Mathematics began to come into its own with the rise of large-scale business . Urban life created a demand for a more exact measurement of time , and watches and clocks were perfected . Other forms of measurement were developed in connection with seafaring and had speedy results . The cheapness of water transport had led the Venetians and Genoese to trade with England and Flanders by sea , sending fleets that coasted along Spain and France . Charts , worked out from observation and soundings , laid the foundations of accurate map-making . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compass , which had long been known , was fitted to enable a helmsman to keep his course . Charts , compass , and other devices made it possible to sail a straight course in cloudy weather out of sight of land . Atlantic island groups ? the Canaries , the Ma- deiras , and the Azores ? were occupied and became outposts of European expansion . After the Ottoman Turks in the East occupied the regions where the trade-routes lay , and became masters of Constantinople , the prices of Oriental goods increased . It was inevitable that the Western nations should look for new routes to the fabulous sources of wealth in the East , and before the century ended a Genoese seaman had found for the Spanish rulers the continent that barred the way via the West , and Portuguese seamen had reached the East by sailing south around Africa . Two notable townsmen faithfully reflect the chief trends of the fifteenth century . The French merchant Jacques Coeur , who helped to introduce into his country large scale banking and merchant enterprise on the Italian model , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of trade with the East . Lorenzo dei Medici , scion of a family of merchant princes , a patron of humanists and artists , a collector of books , and a writer of songs , lived his life in Florence during some of the most colorful days of the Italian Renaissance  | JACQUES COEUR was a French merchant who was born about ten years after Wycliffe 's peaceful death at Lutterworth . His extraordinary career demonstrates the social and economic changes that brought in the modern world , for the transformation of society which had been slowly preparing for some centuries was accomplished by the last half of the fifteenth century . The change was wrought by the accelerated development of capitalism , which is best defined as the use of wealth to produce more wealth . The process began on a wide scale when traders reinvested their profits in a larger stock of goods or in goods of greater value , and progressively gained more profits for reinvestment . Capitalism required the use of more and more money . The feudal age had had little use for money ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peasants provided for the greater part of his needs . The only money he was accustomed to handle was that paid by his vassals in feudal dues , such as aids and reliefs . When he needed an unusual sum , on such an occasion as a crusade , he was forced to borrow it from the merchants in the towns . Here more and more wealth was accumulated as the demand for the rich goods from the East developed and as property increased in value ; and in the towns the amount of money in circulation increased enormously . Guild halls were built in the new Flamboyant Gothic style , which threw off the restraint of the thirteenth-century Gothic , and towns redoubled their rivalry in the building of churches and cathedrals which would testify to their prosperity . The cities which first showed the effects of this new prosperity were in Italy . Venice had maintained its trade with Constantinople . Florence , which had grown rich through the finishing of fine clothe  | minted a new gold coin , the florin , which became a widely used standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kings were wont to do . In Florence and Venice and in the Lombard towns the art of banking developed extensively and great banking families rose to prominence . Jacques Coeur was the first Frenchman to see the possibilities of combining banking and trade . The son of a merchant , he established direct French trade with the Levant and amassed an enormous fortune . He owned silver , lead , and copper mines , a silk factory , and a paper mill ; he had great fleets on the seas and agents everywhere . He loaned money to governments , more often than not for war purposes ? wars had become expensive because of the use of mercenary troops . The feudal army had never been an effective one because its members were free to return home when their brief terms of service expired . By the fourteenth century its effectiveness had been further diminished by the growing tendency to concentrate on the capture of conspicuous enemies who could be held for ransom , as is made clear in the pages of the admiring Froissart . As has been pointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doom of the feudal fighting-man . Gunpowder , although at first used largely to frighten horses , was soon to batter down feudal strongholds . The victorious armies of the future were to be mercenary armies paid from the royal purse , captained by seasoned adventurers , and living at the expense of the inhabitants of invaded countries . Since the Hundred Years ' War was fought on French soil , it was the French peasants who suffered , but in both France and England the merchant class profited . In fact , the war was so profitable that its renewal under Henry V of England , after internal English political difficulties had been overcome , was very popular . During the regency of John of Gaunt for King Richard II , concessions to parliamentary consultation in the government had been made . When Richard later tried to disregard parliament and rule according to his own whims it deposed him and made his cousin , John of Gaunt 's son Henry , king of England ( 1399 ) . Since parliament a century earlier had deposed Edward II also , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Henry VI allowed it to increase its power because they owed to it their possession of the crown . Because of the exigencies of the war parliament had , during the fourteenth century , secured general acceptance of  | its right of impeachment and the principle that no new taxes were to be levied without parliamentary consent . Under Henry IV and Henry V it became customary to vote taxes on the last day of a session , making redress of grievances precede the granting of supply . This was the weapon that eventually gave the English parliament an importance attained by no other medieval estates . Henry V ( 1414 ? 1422 ) , a born fighter , took advantage of French internal difficulties to renew the Hundred Years ' War . Sporadic civil war in France had resulted from the attempts of the chief relatives of the mad Charles VI to secure control of the king 's person and therewith of the royal government . The two chief factions were the Burgundians and the Armagnacs , but something more than family rivalry was involved in the conflict , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of town industry in northern France and Flanders and the latter the predominantly agricultural interests of the south . The renewed English invasion of northern France was followed by the overwhelming defeat of the French at Agincourt , and a few years later the treaty of Troyes ( 1420 ) was concluded between the English and the Burgundian faction , disinheriting Charles VI 's son as illegitimate and making Henry V heir to the kingdom of France . Henry V 's infant son succeeded him as Henry VI in 1422 , and when Charles VI died that same year Henry VI was proclaimed king of France as well . The French south of the Loire , however , where English troops had not penetrated , recognized Charles VI 's son as Charles VII ( 1422 ) . The powerful duke of Burgundy continued to support the English , and Charles VII made no effort to secure his throne until he was forced to it by a rising tide of French patriotism symbolized by a young peasant girl , Joan of Arc . During her brief career ( 1428 ? 31 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's coronation celebrated at Rheims . Once the French king 's crown was secure , he allowed Joan to be captured by the Burgundians , who turned her over to the English , by whom she was tried for witchcraft before an ecclesiastical court and burned at the stake . Roused from his lethargy , Charles won over the duke of Burgundy and organized a standing army to take the place of the feudal levies . He made Jacques Coeur master of the mint , put him in charge of the royal expenditures , and permitted him to make far-reaching financial re ? forms . Charles sent him on several embassies , and borrowed huge  | sums to pay the expenses of a series of campaigns by which the English were finally driven from France . It was largely by the French artillery , against which the much vaunted English longbow was at a disadvantage , that the English were expelled from all France but Calais . While the resources of France and England were being expended in warfare , the fruits of centuries of intellectual and artistic activity continued to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disciples made humanism the intellectual fashion of the day . They were called to the courts of despots who saw a new way of enhancing their prestige , and through the influence of humanists rulers made collections of ancient works of art , coins , gems , and books . Pope Nicholas V was one of the patrons of learning . Among his proteges was Lorenzo Valla , who had exposed as a forgery the Donation of Constantine , basis of proud papal claims ? a feat of scholarship which led the humanist pope Nicholas V to employ him to seek for manuscripts . Some of the Italian despots employed humanists to teach their children , and a new kind of education based on the old Greek idea of training the body as well as the mind was developed . New universities devoted to humanistic studies were founded , and to them came noted teachers . The study of Greek was accelerated by the arrival at Florence in 1396 of Manuel Chrysoloras who taught there several years and placed Greek studies on a firm foundation in Italy . It was inevitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the medium of wandering scholars . Unconscious preparations were being made in Germany ; a movement of mysticism which had been started by a contemporary of Dante , Meister Eckhardt , took the form of educational organizations , such as the Friends of God and the Brethren of the Common Lot . They maintained schools where simple piety was taught and also a better Latin than was then current . Many students trained in these schools were prepared to take up humanistic studies . When they traveled to Italy and fell under the spell of the humanists they were more likely than not to be attracted to the circle of a celebrated Florentine , Pico della Mirandola , who thought Hebrew as worthy of study as the other ancient tongues . The success of German workmen experimenting with block books led after a long period of preparation to the perfection of the art of printing from movable types .  | Thus the method of perpetuating corrected versions of classical texts came into use concurrently with the development of scientific literary criticism by the humanists . More important still , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible . Corresponding progress was being made in the fine arts . Medieval architects had recognized the favors of princes by placing their sculptured effigies along with those of saints on the facades of churches , but the figures were identified by traditional heraldric devices and made subordinate to the architecture . Then with the appearance of rich merchant donors without coats-of-arms came the demand for likenesses , and sculptors began to give their work more realistic treatment , which meant success for naturalistic sculpture . It also meant , especially in the Netherlands , the adaptation of the methods of the miniaturist to painting in a larger scale and in a new oil medium which the Flemings developed . The popes at Avignon and the dukes of Burgundy imported these artists to adorn not only churches but dwellings , and rich merchants followed suit , having their portraits painted for their descendants . In Italy , where the Gothic had not been greatly favored , architects were developing along the lines of the basilica vast churches encrusted with particolored marble . They introduced variety into the fortress-palaces of the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eastern origin , some drawn from the study of long-neglected Roman remains . Roman sarcophagi inspired naturalistic sculpture , and Giotto 's introduction of action into painting flowered in the magnificent compositions of Masaccio , which in turn were to inspire Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo . Humanism was spread incidentally by the church councils that were called to put an end to the Great Schism . The conciliar movement was furthered by an emperor of the house of Luxemburg , who wished to maintain unity in Christendom in face of the advance of the Ottoman Turks . In 1347 , the year before the Black Death , Charles of Luxemburg had become the Emperor Charles IV . His mother was heiress of Bohemia , and his interests were more Czech than German ; he was the founder of the University of Prague . It was Charles IV who had issued the Golden Bull of 1356 , which put imperial elections firmly into the hands of seven electors : the archbishops of Mainz , Trier and Cologne , the count palatine of the  | Rhine , the duke of Saxony , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charles was succeeded by his son Wenzel , who was followed , after a period of rival emperors , by Sigismund of Luxemburg , king of Bohemia and Hungary ( 1410 ) . Sigismund was determined to end the Great Schism . The cardinals of Avignon and Rome had agreed to call a council at Pisa ( 1409 ) , but this council merely complicated matters by electing a third pope . He died the next year and the council chose another , John XXIII , a totally worldly man whom Sigismund forced to call a council at Constance ( 1414 ? 18 ) . This assembled with three avowed purposes : to end the Schism , to reform the church , and to extirpate heresy . The great heretic of the day was the Czech , John Huss , who preached Wycliffe 's doctrines with some additions of his own and who had come to the council on a safe-conduct from the Emperor Sigismund . The council , however , burned Huss and his follower , Jerome of Prague , and performed the futile gesture of ordering Wycliffe 's body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ described in a letter of Poggio Bracciolini , a papal secretary , who characterizes Jerome 's demeanor as like that of an ancient Roman . Poggio was a leading humanist and spent much of his time while at the council rummaging for ancient manuscripts in the libraries of the monasteries around the Lake of Constance . Before proceeding to the work of reformation the council elected Pope Martin V , who promptly dissolved the council and failed to carry out his pledge of reform measures . His successor , Eugenius IV , called the Council of Basel and endeavored unsuccessfully to dissolve it when it opened negotiations with the followers of Huss , who had begun a national Bohemian movement that was both religious and political on the basis of Huss 's teachings . Seceders from the Council of Basel ( 1431 ? 49 ) sat in the Council of Ferrara-Florence ( 1438 ? 45 ) , which tried to reunite the Eastern and Western churches . Many Greek scholars from Constantinople came to attend this council , and when the Ottoman Turks took Constantinople its treasures of Greek scholarship had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The triumphant advance of the nomad Ottoman Turks , who planned to win the Balkans , ruined the Levant trade in which  | Jacques Coeur had been active . In the year of the fall of Constantinople ( 1453 ) the English port of Bordeaux fell to the French forces to whose equipment Jacques Coeur had made important contributions . The Hundred Years ' War was over ; not an Englishman remained on French soil , except at Calais , which the English kept until the next century . Two years before , Coeur had been accused by spiteful tongues of having poisoned the king 's mistress , Agnes Sorel . He was arrested on Charles 's order , stripped of his honors and his fortune , and cast into prison . He escaped , however , to Rome , where Nicholas V took him into the papal service .

In Italy , too , nobles had made themselves the rulers of many of the city states , but Florence , the cradle of humanism , the home of the Italian Renaissance , retained republican forms . The term merchant prince applies fittingly to the heads of the great banking and trading family of Medici , who had no noble blood in their veins but whose descendants sat upon some of the greatest thrones of Europe . Cosimo ( d. 1464 ) , the grandfather of Lorenzo dei Medici , held no office but was virtually dictator of Florence . He made an alliance with Naples , and helped a soldier of fortune named Francesco Sforza win the lordship of neighboring Milan from the Visconti family , believing that by doing so he was winning security for his own city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Cosimo established the famous Platonic Academy which met in his villa in the hills above Florence and kept a light burning before the bust of Plato . He educated a promising boy , Marsiglio Ficino , so that when he grew up he could translate the works of Plato into Latin . He was the friend and patron of Donatello , the sculptor . Donatello in sculpture and Masaccio in painting tried to express harmoniously the spirit of humanism and the conflicting tendencies of the age . Masaccio made skillful use of the contrasts of light and shade and the newly-discovered principle of perspective , and had great influence on the artists who followed him . Rationalism characterized the work of Masaccio and that of the sculptors Ghiberti and Luca della Robbia , as well as the early work of Donatello ; but later a mystical or romantic spirit showed itself in the work of such  | painters as Botticelli and Ghirlandaio , and the sculptor Verrocchio . Although Ghiberti and Brunelleschi , the sculptor-architect , were aided by the study of antiquity , their work was characterized by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was born fifteen years before the death of Jacques Coeur and three years after the Council of FerraraFlorence assembled . He grew up a leader in the varied , joyous life of the city , an enthusiastic humanist , and also a writer of gay songs in the vernacular . When , in 1478 , he succeeded to the unofficial dictatorship of Florence , he gave the citizens pageants more elaborate than they had ever seen and became a patron of the arts . He also built up a reputation as a diplomat . Anxious to keep peace in the Italian peninsula , he renewed his grandfather 's alliances with the powerful states in the north and south , Milan and Naples , which , however , were balanced by an alliance between Venice and the papacy . The keynote of the history of Naples is the struggle between the French house of Anjou and a cadet branch of the Spanish house of Aragon . Both had claimed Sicily and Naples since the thirteenth century , but Alfonso of Aragon ruled Naples and Sicily from 1435 to 1458 . He won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Naples , instituting many reforms and leaving a rich and prosperous kingdom to his illegitimate son Ferrante . Milan had been ruled since 1277 by the Visconti , who had extended their control over much of northern Italy . They were patrons of the arts ; and when Francesco Sforza drove them out with Cosimo 's aid , he too , as duke of Milan , made his court a center for artists and humanists . The other leading powers in Italy were the papacy and Venice . Ever since the end of the Schism the popes had concentrated more and more upon building up their power in the papal states , and their interests as territorial princes frequently overshadowed their preoccupation with matters ecclesiastical . Among those who were patrons of the humanists and of art was Nicholas V , who established the Vatican Library and began the rebuilding of St. Peter 's in Rome . Venice 's dominance in the Mediterranean had been destroyed by the advance of the Ottoman Turks , who succeeded in capturing Constantinople in 1453 . This misfortune did not , however , prevent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the expense of Milan . The Venetians did not adopt humanism until later ,  | but the Venetian printing press of Aldus Manutius turned out fine editions of the classics . Although the conflicting ambitions of these city states had kept the peninsula in a turmoil for centuries , the Medici policy of a strong alliance among the three strategically placed states of Milan , Florence , and Naples might have won peace had not their jealousies brought in the foreigner at the end of the century . Conditions north of the Alps were making the invasion of Italy not only possible but probable . The means were at hand . The end of the Hundred Years ' War left two professional armies without occupation . The English soldiers sold their swords to rival claimants of the throne , descendants of the dukes of Lancaster and York . Three years before Cosimo dei Medici died , the Lancastrian Henry VI was deposed and the Yorkist Edward IV put in his place . After Edward 's death , his brother had Edward 's two sons put to death and reigned briefly as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bosworth Field and was crowned as Henry VII . His royal blood came through his mother , a Lancastrian ; his father belonged to a Welsh family with traditions of thrift and other middle-class qualities which were new to English rulers . Henry 's marriage to Elizabeth of York united Yorkists and Lancastrians and the country again saw peace and prosperity . In France there was no disputed succession to break up a seasoned army . Charles VII kept his together as a regularly paid force . He died the year Henry VI was deposed in England and was succeeded by his son , Louis XI . Louis , an exceedingly unpleasant person but as able as he was unpleasant , made the army more efficient than ever and set out to break the power of the French nobles . He was largely successful . His powerful vassals , the dukes of Burgundy , had almost established Burgundy as a kingdom , but Louis rendered them powerless through a combination of cleverness and luck . Duke Philip the Good of Burgundy , a great patron of the arts , was succeeded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IV of England promptly married his daughter to Charles , but Louis foiled this intrigue through the aid of the Swiss . These hardy Alpine dwellers , who had long since made themselves virtually independent of their Hapsburg overlords , were skillful fighters and defeated Charles ' cavalry in a series of battles , in the last of which Duke Charles himself was slain . Louis then added the duchy of Burgundy to the royal domain .  | Duke Charles had married his heiress , Mary , to Maximilian , heir of the Hapsburg territories , and their son Philip inherited the rest of the vast Burgundian lands . A partial compensation was secured by Louis when he married his son , who was to succeed him as Charles VIII , to Anne of Brittany , and thus added to the royal domain the last of the great Franch fiefs . Absorbed by his struggles with Burgundy , Louis did not realize that , with the increase of wealth and the consequently enhanced demand for the products of the Far East , the future lay with those states which faced the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paying enormous prices for Eastern goods , brought by stages across the deserts of the East to the Black Sea or the Levant . Handled by Byzantine or Italian merchants and bought in Italian cities by traders from beyond the Alps , these goods were sold at fantastic prices in France and England . Marco Polo 's description of China and other widely circulated tales of travelers made known how cheap were spices and other products of the East in the lands of their origin . It is not strange that venturesome souls conceived the idea of reaching the Indies by sailing across the Atlantic to reap fabulous profits through buying cheap and selling dear . The stories told by hardy seamen of Bristol and other western ports ? tales of islands in the Atlantic which would serve as stepping-stones ? made such projects seem feasible , especially as Ptolemy 's computation of the size of the globe made it a third less than the actual size .

The crusade against the Moor was at an end , and Queen Isabella had time to grant an interview in her camp before the fallen stronghold to an Italian sailor named Columbus , who engaged her in the new crusade , a crusade to carry the cross to the lands beyond the western sea . The success of Columbus 's timely interview had momentous consequences : Spanish expansion was diverted from Africa , its logical path , to America . Portugal , the remaining crusading kingdom of the Iberian peninsula , had been founded in the twelfth century by returning cru- saders . For years before the historic interview between Isabella and Columbus , Prince Henry the Navigator , the brother of the king of Portugal , had been sending expeditions along the coast of Africa , partly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These expeditions sailed farther and farther south until in 1487 the Cape of Good Hope was rounded and it became evident that Ptolemy had been wrong in believing the Indian Ocean to be a closed sea .

The world on which Lorenzo 's eyes closed was not the old world centered by the Mediterranean . This sea was no longer the sole approach to the distant region whence came spices and rich goods , and whence came also the alien peoples of whom the latest arrivals had been the Ottoman Turks . The menace of the mysterious ocean had been successfully challenged and the global world had swung into man 's ken .
