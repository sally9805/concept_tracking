The programs were of white silk , printed in gold . In the royal box sat King George V and Queen Mary . It was a command performance , honoring their coronation . <P> On stage was a program fit for a king : Destinn singing arias from Ada , and Melba arias from Romeo and Juliet ; Tetrazzini and John McCormack in a duet from The Barber of Seville . Then came the evening 's climax : the much-bruited new Russian ballet , whose 21-year-old star , Vaslav Nijinsky , had all Europe abuzz with the grace of his dancing and the power of his leaps . That night , London 's applause was added to the Continent 's . <P> One day last month , 36 years later , <P> Vaslav Nijinsky came back to England . At 57 , the grace and ease were no longer in his step and his round Slavic face showed the pallor of years of illness and the vacuity of long insanity . Dressed in a dark blue suit , which looked incongruous on him , he shuffled aimlessly along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife . <P> Once , ten years ago , the harsh outlines of reality had begun to focus in Nijinsky 's blurred mind . He was allowed to leave his secluded asylum in Switzerland , lived privately for a time in his wife 's native Hungary . He had begun to recognize friends . Then came war , and the sound of bombs sent him cowering back into his world of shadow . The Russians found him in Hungary , put him up in the best hotel in Vienna , gave him a box at the ballet . The Russians assured Romola that Nijinsky would be welcomed in Russia as a hero of the Soviet Union . Once they got him drunk , and Nijinsky danced for them ( TIME , Aug. 20 , 1945 ) . But Romola wanted to take him to western Europe . <P> Last week , helped by English friends , Nijinsky was comfortably settled in a country hotel in Surrey . There he plays games of patience with his attendant . He likes to listen to the radio , occasionally dances to music he likes-if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He still draws strange faces and spidery designs . When strangers approach , his brown eyes look hunted and wild and he grips his chair . Romola still believes that her husband has a dancing future . Says she : " Nijinsky 's one wish is to go to America . There he was happy in his art . He will dance again . " <P> Romola would also like to get her daughter Kyra in the movies . But Kyra , who is 33 and runs a ballet school in France , wants to dance . Says Romola : " I do n't advise anyone to dance . You train for 20 years and are famous for three . "
