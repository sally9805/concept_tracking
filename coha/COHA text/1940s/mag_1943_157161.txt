U.S. businessmen last week awaited the solution of a 95-year-old corporate mystery : the financial setup of powerful , respectable New Jersey Zinc Co. , founded in 1848 and one of the world 's largest zinc miners . The answer will come when the estate of its former board chairman , the late Edgar Palmer , unveils detailed corporation figures , thus greases the ways to sell some 400,000 shares of New Jersey Zinc common . This block represents working control of the company ( 20% ) and must be sold to pay inheritance taxes . <P> Into the Sanctum . Soon to be unveiled by circumstance , New Jersey Zinc has grown big on strict attention to business and a devout policy of the less said the better . For decades its stockholder reports have been dull , stereotyped affairs with a peek at quarterly earnings ; its reams of trade publicity have never given a hint of production , sales or industry position ; its prim officers never discuss anything not already in print . The company 's practical downtown Manhattan offices are pervaded by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hats when a girl gets into an elevator . Even at the annual Christmas parties no wine , liquor or horseplay is tolerated . <P> One &; only outsider ever to wiggle into this inner sanctum was a New York Times reporter who in 1938 unearthed a complete ten-year income account and balance sheet from moldy court records . These proved New Jersey Zinc everything it was supposed to be : at the end of depression year 1934 , cash and securities totaled $41,691,000 , surplus was $29,515,000 , total assets $84,218,000 . Sales figures were less impressive , ranged from 1926 's $26,769,000 to 1932 's $7,715,000 . But the key to the company 's prosperity was the lusty net-to-sales ratio-in the 1926-34 period earnings were never less than 24 per $1 of sales , after all taxes . <P> Into the War . Any later details are a company secret . But one thing is certain : New Jersey Zinc 's plants in its home State , Pennsylvania , and the West are all-out for war . Biggest wartime zinc need is for millions of shell cases , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copper . Then comes a string of zinc alloy castings for trucks and aircraft ( fuel pumps , carburetors , door handles , etc. ) , die-cast gun sights , shell fuses and fire pumps , galvanized ship plates , sanitary equipment and plain tin roofs . Atop this are zinc oxide for paint , tires and medical supplies , " spiegeleisen " ( mirror iron ) for steel furnace purification , zinc dust for rust prevention . All these have probably boosted sales to $50,000,000 a year , forced New Jersey Zinc 's production above 150,000 tons , about 15% of total U.S. output . Punctually enough , New Jersey Zinc last week issued its terse earnings report , showed 1942 profits down 25% to $7,231,000 . But as usual the company gave no explanation of the decline , no estimate of the future . And when a top-drawer official was asked if the Palmer estate intended to sell its stock , an evasive answer slurred back : " Really ? "                   @ @
