To answer some of the questions our subscribers have been asking about how TIME gathers , verifies , writes and distributes its news . <P> If you are a " typical TIME reader " ( this week , men only ) you have blue eyes and brown hair , are 5 ft. 9 in. tall , weigh 165 Ibs. and wear glasses . The chances are 100 to i against your wearing a beard , 10 to 1 against your having a mustache . Instead you shave clean every day , and you are more likely to swear than sing while you are doing it . You do n't admit to a bay window-and you have no use for setting up exercises . <P> You support a family of three or four ( statistically speaking , you have 1.25 children and think they are getting a better education i , , = . than you did ) . You own your own home , contribute $84.12 a year to charity , spend $97.95 for medicaland dental care , pay out $301.97 in insurance premiums . You bought your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 31,250 miles ; you usually trade it in every three years , but now you will hang onto it until the new models come out after the war . You own four business suits and at least one suit of dinner clothes , and your wife has three evening gowns ( you think she should have more ) . Chances are you are in business , an executive or department head with 33 people under you-and you 're probably earning more money than a year ago ( 69.7% of TIME subscribers are ) . You own stock in at least one company-and you do n't claim to have made more than you lost in Wall Street . You 're working longer hours than ever before , but you still find time for civic activities and civilian defense , and for your favorite hobbies- gardening , photography , golf , fishing . You have a radio , of course , and your favorite programs are Information , Please , Fibber McGee and Molly , and Jack Benny . You are likely to play a musical instrument yourself , and you admit you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the piano , but it could be the violin , clarinet or saxophone , or even the tipple , zither or glockenspiel ) . You go to the movies only once every other week or so ( whenever there 's a picture you really want to see ) and once or twice a week you have friends in for dinner or bridge ( you do n't like restaurant meals nearly as much as those your wife serves at home ) . <P> These days , of course , you ca n't travel the way you used to-but you still have a tremendous interest in the world around you-for not only do you read TIME every week , but you buy two daily newspapers as well - spend 38.4 minutes a day looking through them . You ' listen to the radio commentators ( Raymond Gram Swing , Lowell Thomas and Fulton Lewis Jr . are your favorites ) . You own 241 books , buy eight more every year ( TIME subscribers buy about one-eighth of all the adult , non-technical books sold in the U.S. ) . Your three favorites last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here , Private Hargrove-in that order . <P> One reason we have to find out so much about our subscribers is that TIME , alone among all U.S. magazines , is written " as if by one person for one person . " By that I mean that TIME is planned to be read from cover to cover like a book-that nothing goes into TIME that we do not think you would be interested in knowing .
