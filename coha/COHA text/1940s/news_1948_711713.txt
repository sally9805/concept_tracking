txt Whittaker Chambers , the avowed courier for a pre-war Washington spy ring " apparatus " that he says extracted vital Government documents for transmission to Russia , resigned yesterday as a senior editor of Time magazine . In a statement given out by his attorneys , Mr. Chambers said that both his tender of resignation and its acceptance became " imperative " with his disclosures of Communist espionage . At the Federal I Building , where he appeared before a special grand jury for the fifth straight day , he dez.ied that his ' resignation was forced . James A. Linen , publisher of the magazine , said that it was not prejudging Mr. Chambers ' recent ' disclosures . He added that Mr. Chambers ' admitted disservice to his country in the past must be weighed against the service he is now trying to perform . While Federal officials maintained rigidly their policy of re fusing to discuss any aspect of the case being presented to the grand jury , it was learned that the Chambers phase is expected to be " cleaned up " before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was learned further that a successor grand jury , the panel for which has been drawn , will at once begin a collateral inquiry into espionage and subversiveness . The first witness before the new panel is expected to be Miss Elizabeth Bentley . She testified last summer before the House Committee on Un-American Activities , and later before the Federal Grand Jury here . In her House Committee testimony she told a story of alleged espionage involving Government officials running parallel // to the one related by Mr. Chambers , but so far as is known different personalities were named by the two witnesses . With the current grand jury ending its eighteen-month tenure ? the maximum the law provides ? next Wednesday , informed sources said that any indictments in the Chambers case , if the evidence warranted , would be returned before the date . Thus the slate would be wiped clean for the presentation of Miss Bentley 's testimony . The present grand jury will meet from 10 A. M. to noon today and will resume all-day sessions until its term runs out , officials said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. and Mrs. Alger Hiss and Henry Julian Wadleigh . Mr. Hiss , a former State Department official accused by Mr. Chambers in a sworn affidavit of turning over to him secret files , has unqualifiedly denied his accusations and is suing Mr. Chambers for $75,000 libel damages in Baltimore Federal Court . Mrs. Hiss , appearing before the grand jury for the first time , has been charged by Mr. Chambers with helping to copy some of the restricted documents in her home . Mr. Wadleigh had been named by Mr. Chambers , according to the House committee , as a second former Government attache who supplied documents to the " apparatus . " It could not be established whether , as reported , Mt . Wadleigh had testified last Wednesday before the grand jury . The former State Department economist in his appearance on Thursday before the House committee in Washington had refused to say whether he had delivered secret Government documents to anyone for forwarding to Soviet agents . Thomas J. Donegan , special assistant to the Attorney General in charge of presentation of the spy ring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witnesses , " three or four , " had appeared during the day who had not previously testified . Hiss- Gets Two Subpoenas As has been the case since the grand jury inquiry was revived with the turning up of microfilms of State Department documents in a hollowed-out pumpkin on Mr. Chambers ' Maryland farm , the witness tug of war between the House committee and the Department of Justice was continued yesterday . Mr. Hiss found himself with two subpoenas for his appearance today , both before the House committee and the grand jury . When he left the Federal Building he said he could not say at that time which one he would honor . Last night he disclosed that he had elected to appear before the grand jury this morning . Late in the afternoon he sent a telegram to the committee saying that as a consequence of the grand jury subpoena he would be unable to appear before the committee in Washington today . Another person expected to testify before the grand jury today is William Ward Pigman , 38-year-old chemist , named by Mr. Chambers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employe who furnished official documents to the spy ring . Mr. Pigman , who was attached to the Bureau of Standards from 1930 to 1938 and from 1941 to 1944 , left his home at Appleton , Wis. , Thursday night and was reported to have reached here last night . He , too , is under subpoena by the House committee . Mr. Chambers ' resignation was announced by his attorneys , Minton &; , at their offices . Statement by Chambers Copies of a " Statement by Whittaker Chambers " were distributed . They said : " I have offered by resignation as a senior editor of Time magazine . It has been accepted . Both of these acts became imperative when I recently began to make revelations about Communist espionage . When Time hired me in 1939 , its editors knew that I was an ex-Communist ; they did not know that espionage was involved . " For nine years I have been actively fighting communism . I believe I was helpful in alerting Time 's editors years ago to the dangers of world-wide communism which have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ally , if imperfectly , understood in this country . " In my own writing I have tried to give expression to human values which I knew from my own experience communism denies and destroys . Now , after nine years of work done in good conscience , I have been called upon to expose the darkest and most dangerous side of : munism  --  espionage . " This c i be done only if a man who knows the facts will stand up and tell them without regard to the cost or consequences to himself . I can not share this indispensable ordeal with anyone . There- , fore , with a quiet and firm mind , I am withdrawing from among the colleagues with whom I worked for so many years and whose support has been loyal and generous . " Mr. Linefi , on behalf of the magazine , issued the following state-ment : " Time has accepted Mr. Chambers ' resignation for the reasons which he has so well expressed . In accepting his resignation now , Time does not wish to prejudge and is not prejudging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in can the pros and cons be weighed . " Against the admitted disservice to his country , of a decade ago , must be set the service we are convinced he is trying to perform for his country now . " Mrs. Priscilla Hiss , accompanied by Edward C. , one of her husband 's attorneys , declined to discuss her grand jury appearance . " I 'm sorry , I do n't think I shall say anything , " she said . " I just do n't feel like it . " A small , pe , rt-looking woman with graying hair , Mrs. Hiss is a teacher in the Dalton School at 108 East Eighty-ninth Street . She wore a black cloth coat lined and trimmed with Persian lamb , a gray tailored suit , a gray blouse , a. gray hat with two feathers and low-heeled brown shoes . Said to Answer All Questions While her husband replied to questions with the " no comment " answer that has become the virtual standard of both witnesses and officials at the Federal Building , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer any question asked of him before the grand jury or the House Committee . It was pointed out particularly that he has never taken refuge in his constitutional right not to answer questions on the ground that the replies might tend to incriminate him . Easily the most nervous witness yet to appear before the grand jury was Mr. Wadleigh , who from 1936 to 1943 was a State Department employe in the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Division . Mr. Wadleigh told reporters that he was " not making any statement until this investigation is over . " He could not promise that he would ' make one after it was over , he said in response to a question . When he was asked whether he had testified , whether he was in ! the building under subpoena , whether he would return the following day , land similar questions that did not touch on the facts of the case , he said testily : " You have the right to aSk and I have the right not to answer questions , so do n't argue . " He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his actions when it was pointed out to him that the questions *ere fair ones and incidental only to the reporters ' attempts to keep abreast of a story into which he had been projected as a principal figure . Mr. Chambers was noncommittal about his future , when asked about it . He did say that " I am still a dairy farmer " - and that he had thirty cows and 300 ? acres : at his farm near Westminster , Md . Asked . whether he was undergoing a trying ordeal , he said , " Well , it has n't been easy . " He would not discuss his grand jury appearance .
