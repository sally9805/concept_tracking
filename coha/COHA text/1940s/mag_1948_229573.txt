As Harold Stassen bayed excitedly on Speculator Ed Pauley 's trail last week , he ran smack into Maryland 's lank-cheeked Senator Millard Tydings . Drawing himself up to his full height before the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee , Senator Tydings demanded : " Have you any evidence of any person in Government who has given any inside information to any speculator in any market ? " Stassen 's answer was a weak " No . " He said he was " relying on the pattern of operations rather than any specific evidence . " <P> Angry Twitch . Harold Stassen had come to the hearing primed with fresh charges . While Pauley glowered at him across the witness table , Stassen declared that Pauley had not liquidated his holdings after he became an Army assistant last September . Instead , Pauley had bought large amounts of lard and cottonseed oil , taken a $56,360 profit after the Government announced large purchases for shipment abroad . Previous deals in wheat , oats and hides followed the same " pattern .

His transactions since the day he became Army assistant had been only those incident to the " orderly liquidation " of his holdings . Cried Pauley : " I have been seriously and perhaps irreparably harmed by Mr. Stassen 's falsehoods and unfounded charges . . . . He has combined ignorance and falsehood to indict me solely in pursuit of his own selfish ambitions . " <P> Last Word . Senator Ferguson asked Stassen if he wanted to reply . Stassen did . Leaping to his feet , he cried : " In his protestations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Harold Stassen had failed to support most of his charges . Many a citizen thought the final word should come from the committee . In doing any speculating at all , Ed Pauley had technically ( but , he claimed , unwittingly ) violated the executive order forbidding Government employees to speculate ; he had morally violated the tenet that public servants must be above suspicion . But was he guilty of using his public position for his private profit ? The committee owed Ed Pauley , and the public , an answer .
