Up before the District of Columbia Board of Education last week was a new health course for Washington school boys &; girls . Its theme : the evils of the Demon Rum and Nicotine . Calculated to scare a youngster stiff , the course totted up an unusually extensive list of dire results of smoking and drinking-from duodenal ulcer to divorce . <P> One member of the board is a physician and a Gannon-Dr . James A. , forthright brother of Fordham 's forthright President Robert I. Gannon. * <P> " Bunk ! " cried Dr. Gannon . " I use alcohol and tobacco moderately myself , and so do 95% of the people . It not only prolongs life but makes it more enjoyable . There is no method that we doctors have that is better to combat fever than a good application of alcohol . " <P> Dr. Gannon moved that the course be rewritten by three doctors , stripped of " misinformation . " <P> * Who last fortnight gallantly confessed his ormer isolationist errors ( TIME , Sept. 21 ) .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
