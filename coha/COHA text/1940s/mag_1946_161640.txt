In Germany last week , one denazification project looked like a success . Officials had nothing to do with it . It was the inspiration of G.I.s themselves . To a military conference in the U.S. Army 's Bremen area , Sergeant Patrick J. Moriarty , a big , blue-eyed , redheaded Irishman from Shakopee , Minn. , described the job . <P> Moriarty fought the war in the South Pacific . He went to Germany last spring . Said he : " I saw kids in the streets picking up cigaret butts and begging . They all looked hungry , backward , scared . You know , they got an awfully dirty deal in this war ; never had anything to look forward to . Me , I lost a redheaded kid brother , and I looked at these kids and at our job over here , and , by God , I do n't ever want to think he died in vain . So I decided to do something . " <P> Moriarty and nine other G.I.s of the Labor Supervision Office , where he works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ten American soldiers are willing to spend free time organizing club for German boys ages 10 to 17 . No politics allowed . " <P> Said Moriarty : " I did n't think we 'd get 25 answers . Well , we got a deluge . After we reached 6,500 , we called a halt . Kids were climbing in windows , telephoning , crowding at the door . In all , we had at least 7,000 who applied . " <P> Of those 7,000 , 100 boys were chosen as members of the Bremen Boys ' Club , BBC for short . Two original members , Martin Girschner , 16 , now temporary president , and Guenther Hoist , 15 , now temporary vice president , helped with selections . Applicants were asked to fill out forms . On the basis of these forms and the way in which questions were answered , the selections were made . Membership had to be limited , but there are now about 20 more than the limit of 100 in the club . <P> Secret Ballot . The German boys run the club @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counselors . They provide transport , equipment , refreshments and other necessary items out of their own pockets . But from the first , Moriarty pounded home the point that the object of the club was to teach German boys the independent , democratic way of life . And they are learning it . First they elected temporary officers . G.I.s and counselors guided them . One of the first things the boys wanted to know was how the secret ballot system works . The temporary officers then drew up temporary rules . Rule No.11 : no political party domination . Other rules : good conduct , no taking food out of the club , no begging or picking up butts in the street , etc . <P> The next step was selection of committees : social welfare , which helps needy boys get jobs , clothing , better housing , sports , theater , etc . Members of these committees are now drawing up the club constitution . Its basic principles : the four freedoms . <P> All this was initiated by the boys themselves . Moriarty and his fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Said Sergeant Moriarty : " When we leave here , we want these kids to be able to go on running the club on their own . So we keep out of things and leave it to them . "
