This was the organization that built the campaigns for war bonds , salvage , and the multitude of other emergency problems presented to the American public during the war years . <P> After V-J day the Council decided to remain in business because 1 ) the Government still needed the kind of service it could perform , and 2 ) peacetime problems were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the appropriate sponsor , could certainly be considered matters of public welfare . <P> At the first meeting of the Advertising Council to canvass " public welfare " possibilities , it was decided that world trade &; world travel was such a topic .
