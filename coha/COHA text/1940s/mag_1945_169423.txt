President Edelmiro Farrell , front man for Argentina 's militarists , stood up before the annual Army &; Navy banquet last week and growled a reluctant concession . He solemnly promised to call a presidential election " before the end of the year . " <P> Farrell 's announcement may have averted a civil war in Argentina , whose political temperature has recently neared the boiling point . But critics noted the delay . Allowing three months for campaigning , the elections would come in February or March . By then , the militarists ' chances might be better . They could hardly be worse than they are at present . <P> Last week the Radical ( Centrist ) Party , Argentina 's biggest , landed a haymaker . From all over the country , delegates converged upon Nueve de Julio , 200 miles from Buenos Aires . Party conventions had long been forbidden , but Police Chief Filomeno Velazco 's strong men did not interfere with this one . Admiral Alberto Teisaire , Acting Minister of the Interior , had assured Big Boss Juan Pern that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Government . The Admiral 's own brother , Eduardo , was one of the leaders . <P> Barrack-Room Blandishments . Pern had wooed the Radical leaders with barrack-room blandishments . Once he got control of their rusty but still-effective party machinery , he hoped to outsmart his enemies , become " elected " president of Argentina . <P> The delegates sat down at banquet tables . When speeches began , not a voice spoke up for the militarists . Instead came a barrage of bitter denunciations . Leader after leader lambasted Pern and his Government . The worst blow came from Brother Eduardo Teisaire , who cried : " There are no Argentines in Government House . " <P> Pern bellowed defiance . He threatened the U.S. , which was increasingly hostile , with an Argentine-Russian alignment . He threatened the Argentine people with civil war and social revolution . " I have no fear of civil war , " he told a visiting Cuban publisher . " ... I have an army of 100,000 . . . and 4,000,000 workers armed with clubs . . . . " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he told them bluntly : " As of midnight Wednesday , freedom of the press in Argentina is through . " Foreign correspondents could still send out their reports , but they might not be reprinted in Argentina . Shortly after , he added strategy to defiance . The promised election might mollify some of his enemies . And in eight months , anything could happen .
