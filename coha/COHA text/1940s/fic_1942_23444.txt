ANOTHER APRIL A STORY BY JESSE STUART N ow , Pap , you wo n't get cold , " Mom said as she put a heavy wool cap over his head . " Huh , what did ye say ? " Grandpa asked , holding his big hand cupped over his ear to catch the sound . " Wait until I get your gloves , " Mom said , hollering real loud in Grandpa 's ear . Mom had forgotten about his gloves until he raised his big bare hand above his ear.to catch the sound of Mom 's voice . " Do n't get ' em , " Grandpa said , " I wo n't ketch cold . " Mom did n't pay any attention to what Grandpa said . She went on to get the gloves anyway . Grandpa turned toward me . He saw that I was looking at him . " Yer Ma 's a-puttin ' enough clothes on me to kill a man , " Grandpa said , then he laughed a coarse laugh like March wind among the pine tops at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's words . He thought I was laughing at them and we both laughed together . It pleased Grandpa to think that I had laughed with him over something funny that he had said . But I was laughing at the way he was dressed . He looked like a picture of Santa Claus . But Grandpa 's cheeks were not cherry-red like Santa Claus ' cheeks . They were covered with white thin beard  --  and above his eyes were long white eyebrows almost as white as percoon petals and very much longer . Grandpa was wearing a heavy wool suit that hung loosely about his big body but fitted him tightly round the waist where he was as big and as round as a flour barrel . His pant legs were as big round his pipe-stem legs as emptied meal sacks . And his big shoes , with his heavy wool socks dropping down over their tops , looked like sled runners . Grandpa wore a heavy wool shirt and over his wool shirt he wore a heavy wool sweater and then his coat over the top of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and about his neck he wore a wool scarf . The way Mom had dressed Grandpa you 'd think there was a heavy snow on the ground but there was n't . April was here instead and the sun was shining on the green hills where the wild plums and the wild crab apples were in bloom enough to make you think there were big snowdrifts sprinkled over the green hills . When I looked at Grandpa and then looked out at the window at the sunshine and the green grass I laughed more . Grandpa laughed with me . " I 'm a-goin ' to see my old friend , " Grandpa said just as Mom came down the stairs with his gloves . " Who is he , Grandpa ? " I asked , but Grandpa just looked at my mouth working . He did n't know what I was saying . And he hated to ask me the second time . Mom put the big wool gloves on Grandpa 's hands . He stood there just like I had to do years ago , and let Morn put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers back in the glove-fingers exactly right Grandpa quarreled at Mom . And when Mom fixed his fingers exactly right in his gloves the way he wanted them Grandpa was pleased . " I 'll be a-goin ' to see ' im , " Grandpa said to Mom . " I know he 'll still be there . " Mom opened our front door for Grandpa and he stepped out slowly , supporting himself with his big cane in one hand . With the other hand he held to the door facing . Mom let him out of the house just like she used to let me out in the spring . And when Grandpa left the house I wanted to go with him , but Mom would n't let me go . I wondered if he would get away from the house  --  get out of Mom 's sight  --  and pull off his shoes and go barefooted and wade the creeks like I used to do when Mom let me out . Since Mom would n't let me go with Grandpa , I watched him as he walked slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood there watching Grandpa too . I think she was afraid that he would fall . But Mom was fooled ; Grandpa toddled along the path better than my baby brother could . " He used to be a powerful man , " Mom said more to herself than she did to me . " He was a timber cutter . No man could cut more timber than my father ; no man in the timber woods could sink an ax deeper into a log than my father . And no man could lift the end of a bigger saw log than Pap could . " " Who is Grandpa goin ' to see , Mom ? " I asked . " He 's not goin ' to see anybody , " Mom said . " I heard ' im say that he was goin ' to see an old friend , " I told her . " Oh , he was just a-talkin ' , " Mom said . I watched Grandpa stop under the pine tree in our front yard . He set his cane against the pine tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pocket . Then Grandpa stooped over slowly , as slowly as the wind bends down a sapling , and picked up a pine cone in his big soft fingers . Grandpa stood fondling thepine cone in his hand . Then , one by one , he pulled the little chips from the pine cone  --  tearing it to pieces like he was hunting for something in it  --  and after he had torn it to pieces he threw the pine-cone stem on the ground . Then he pulled pine needles from a low hanging pine bough and he felt of each pine needle between his fingers . He played with them a long time before he started down the path . " What 's Grandpa doin'n I asked Mom . But Morn did n't answer me : " How long has Grandpa been with us ? " I asked Mom . " Before you 's born , " she said . " Pap has been with us eleven years . He was eighty when he quit cuttin ' timber and farmin ' ; now he 's ninety-one . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd walk out on the snow and ice barefooted and carry wood in the house and put on the fire . He had shoes but he would n't bother to put them on . And I heard her say that he would cut timber on the coldest days without socks on his feet but with his feet stuck down in cold brogan shoes and he worked stripped above the waist so his arms would have freedom when he swung his double-bitted ax . I had heard her tell how he 'd sweat and how the sweat in his beard would be icicles by the time he got home from work on the cold winter days . Now Mom would n't let him get out of the house for she wanted him to live a long time . As I watched Grandpa go down the path toward the hog pen he stopped to examine every little thing along his path . Once he waved his cane at a butterfly as it zigzagged over his head , its polka-dot wings fanning the blue April air . Grandpa would stand when a puff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wind and let the wind play with his white whiskers . I thought maybe his face was hot under his beard and he was letting the wind cool his face . When he reached the hog pen he called the hogs down to the fence . They came running and grunting to Grandpa just like they were talking to him . I knew that Grandpa could n't hear them trying to talk to him but he could see their mouths working and he knew they were trying to say something . He leaned his cane against the hog pen , reached over the fence , and patted the hogs ' heads . Grandpa did n't miss patting one of our seven hogs . As he toddled up the little path alongside the hog pen he stopped under a blooming dogwood . He pulled a white blossom from a bough that swayed over the path above his head , and he leaned his big bundled body against the dogwood while he tore each petal from the blossom and examined it carefully . There was n't anything his dim blue eyes missed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the garden to break a tiny spray of redbud blossoms . He took each blossom from the spray and examined it carefully . " Gee , it 's funny to watch Grandpa , " I said to Mom , then I laughed . " Poor Pap , " Mom said , " he 's seen a lot of Aprils come and go . He 's seen more Aprils than he will ever see again . " I do n't think Grandpa missed a thing on the little circle he took before he reached the house . He played with a bumblebee that was bending a wind-flower blossom that grew near our corncrib beside a big bluff . But Grandpa did n't try to catch the bumblebee in his big bare hand . I wondered if he would and if the bumblebee would sting him , and if he would holler . Grandpa even pulled a butterfly cocoon from a blackberry briar that grew beside his path . I saw him try to tear it into shreds but he could n't . There was n't any butterfly in it , for I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the polka-dot wings , that Grandpa waved his cane at when he first left the house , had come from this cocoon . I laughed when Grandpa could n't tear the cocoon apart . " I 'll bet I can tear that cocoon apart for Grandpa if you 'd let me go help him , " I said to Mom . " You leave your Grandpa alone , " Mom said . " Let ' im enjoy April . " Then I knew that this was the first time Mom had let Grandpa out of the house all winter . I knew that Grandpa loved the sunshine and the fresh April air that blew from the redbud and dogwood blossoms . He loved the bumblebees , the hogs , the pine cones , and pine needles . Grandpa did n't miss a thing along his walk . And every day from now on until just before frost Grandpa would take this little walk . He 'd stop along and look at everything as he had done summers before . But each year he did n't take as long a walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring he did n't go down to the lower end of the hog pen as he had done last year . And when I could first remember Grandpa going on his walks he used to go out of sight . He 'd go all over the farm . And he 'd come to the house and take me on his knee and tell me about all that he had seen . Now Grandpa was n't getting out of sight . I could see him from the window along all of his walk . Grandpa did n't come back into the house at the front door . He tattled around back of the house toward the smokehouse and I ran through the living room to the dining room so I could look out at the window and watch him . " Where 's Grandpa gain ' ? " I asked Mom . " Now never mind , " Mom said . " Leave your Grandpa alone . Do n't go out there and disturb him . " " I wo n't bother ' im , Mom , " I said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " All right , " Mom said . But Mom wanted to be sure that I did n't bother him so she followed me into the dining room . Maybe she wanted to see what Grandpa was going to do . She stood by the window and we watched Grandpa as he walked down beside our smokehouse where a tall sassafras tree 's thin leaves fluttered in the blue April wind . Above the smokehouse and the tall sassafras was a blue April sky  --  so high you could n't see the sky-roof . It was just blue space and little white clouds floated upon this blue . When Grandpa reached the smokehouse he leaned his cane against the sassafras tree . He let himself down slowly to his knees as he looked carefully at the ground . Grandpa was looking at something and I wondered what it was . I just did n't think or I would have known . " There you are , my good old friend , " Grandpa said . " Who is his friend , Mom ? " I asked . Mom did n't say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with that old terrapin , Mom , " I said . " I know he is , " Mom said . " The terrapin does n't mind if Grandpa strokes his head with his hand , " I said . " I know it , " Mom said . " But the old terrapin wo n't let me do it , " I said . " Why does he let Grandpa ? " " The terrapin knows your Grandpa . " " He ought to know me , " I said , " but when I try to stroke his head with my hand , he closes up in his shell . " Mom did n't say anything . She stood by the window watching Grandpa and listening to Grandpa talk to the terrapin . " My old friend , how do you like the sunshine ? " Grandpa asked the terrapin . The terrapin turned his fleshless face to one side like a hen does when she looks at you in the sunlight . He was trying to talk to Grandpa ; maybe the terrapin could understand what Grandpa was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard winter , " Grandpa said . " How have you fared under the smokehouse floor ? " " Does the terrapin know what Grandpa is sayin ' ? " I asked Mom . " I do n't know , " she said . " I 'm awfully glad to see you , old fellow , " Grandpa said . He did n't offer to bite Grandpa 's big soft hand as he stroked his head . " Looks like the terrapin would bite Grandpa , " I said . " That terrapin has spent the winters under that smokehouse for fifteen years , " Mom said . " Pap has been acquainted with him for eleven years . He 's been talkin ' to that terrapin every spring . " " How does Grandpa know the terrapin is old ? " I asked Mom , " It 's got 1847 cut on its shell , " Mom said . " We know he 's ninety-five years old . He 's older than that . We do n't know how old he was when that date was cut on his back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mom ? " " I do n't know , child , " she said , " but I 'd say whoever cut that date on his back has long been under the ground . " Then I wondered how a terrapin could get that old and what kind of a looking person he was who cut the date on the terrapin 's back . I wondered where it happened  --  if it happened near where our house stood . I wondered who lived here on this land then , what kind of a house they lived in , and if they had a sassafras with tiny thin April leaves on its top growing in their yard , and if the person that cut the date on the terrapin 's back was buried at Plum Grove , if he had farmed these hills where we lived to-day and cut timber like Grandpa had  --  and if he had seen the Aprils pass like Grandpa had seen them and if he enjoyed them like Grandpa was enjoying this April . I wondered if he had looked at the dogwood blossoms , the redbud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are you well , old fellow ? " , Grandpa asked the terrapin . The terrapin just looked at Grandpa . " I 'm well as common for a man of my age , " Grandpa said . " Did the terrapin ask Grandpa if he was well ? " I asked Mom . " I do n't know , " Mom said . ! I ca n't talk to a terrapin . " " But Grandpa can ? ! " Yes . " " Wait until tomatoes get ripe and we 'll go to the garden together , " Grandpa said . " Does a terrapin eat tomatoes ? " I asked Mom . " Yes , that terrapin has been eatin ' tomatoes from our garden for fifteen years , " Mom said . " When Mick was tossin ' the terrapins out of the tomato patch , he picked up this one and found the date cut on his back . He put him back in the patch and told him to help himself . He lives from our garden every year . We do n't bother him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He spends his winters under our smokehouse floor buried in the dry ground . " " Gee , Grandpa looks like the terrapin , " I said . Mom did n't say anything ; tears came to her eyes . She wiped them from her eyes with the corner of her apron . " I 'll be back to see you , " Grandpa said . " I 'm a-gettin ' a little chilly ; I 'll be gettin ' back to the house . " The terrapin twisted his wrinkled neck without moving his big body , poking his head deeper into the April wind as Grandpa pulled his bundled body up by holding to the sassafras tree trunk . " Good-by , old friend ! " The terrapin poked his head deeper into the wind , holding one eye on Grandpa , for I could see his eye shining in the sinking sunlight . Grandpa got his cane that was leaned against the sassafras tree trunk and hobbled slowly toward the house . The terrapin looked at him with first one eye and then the other . SOLAR SONG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk But remember in echoes . Be still While the deep sea sings to you , while the alarm Sounds out from the storm , while the sky With its high individual bells Provides its own voice . Be patient , Wait for the rain , for its balanced lyrics , Its swift intermezzos  --  for snow , Sheer drift of innocent song . Be a listener only . The roots will tell you Their own dark strains , surge and creation . Hear the cries from the roses ' lips , or the limpid Violet warnings . The social stones Will unloosen their shocks of words . The grave ice will swing forward Solemn cadenzas . Weeds will speak Their fitful impressions , their delicate messages . Everything , givers its tongue , Will be truthful enough , be fluent enough . Never seek . For the world 's urge spells it all Out in great brave sentences , now and forever , Everywhere solar song .
