Horse Fever ( by Eugene Conrad , Zac &; Ruby Gabel ; produced by Alex Yokel ) . A poor attempt by Producer Yokel to repeat the success of Three Men on a Horse , this preposterous comedy is like one of the more demented comic strips come to life . It is the story of a family that inherits a race horse which wo n't start with the rest of the field . Unfortunately the family has an inventive cousin who has already cluttered up the house with a shoe-shining device that pops out of the wall , a musical chair that plays when rocked , a rattrap shaped like an egg beater ( supposed to fool the rats , it fools instead the colored maid ) . He has also put the family into the business of making hamburgers saturated with vodka , landing the Old Man in jail . Wanting to redeem himself , the cousin attempts to psychoanalyze the race horse . His theory is that , having won her first race , she felt cheated when she found herself right back where she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properties on the stage as in Hellzapoppin . Least loony is the horse . Trilby , which appears in person . Ezra Stone makes the scientifical cousin almost as objectionable as his family thinks he is . Lou Lubin is hilarious as a tough little race-track tout . At times the play promises to develop a surrealist edge and wit . It never keeps its promise .
