As good news continued to roll in from world battlefronts last week , stock traders translated it into highly selective buy &; sell orders reflecting confidence in the United Nations that welled up ten days before U.S. troops set foot in North Africa . Main trend : " peace stocks " boomed , " war stocks " slumped-and hedgers ' stocks ( like motors ) , which stand to benefit from both war and peace , stayed where they were , close to the year 's highs . <P> Since the railroads ( because of their large current business and excess-profits tax credits ) are huge beneficiaries of the war-production boom , their shares were the outstanding target for bears . Bulls placing bets on a prompt peace caused an almost perpendicular rise in the long-neglected bonds of conquered Europe . <P> On the New York Stock Exchange traders grabbed for Polish , Serbian , Czech and Danish bonds as if the reconstruction had already begun . In London the trend was even more pronounced : for 100-par Polish 4s the price hit 28 ( almost six times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( up from a low of 8 ) , Danish 45 to 51 ( from 20 ) . And on the day after the African invasion the Amsterdam bourse had such a flood of hopeful buying ( e.g. Royal Dutch 1,000-florin par went to 361 , up 100 points from the month before ) that the Nazis stepped in and decreed that henceforth stock prices could not change more than 3% from the day before .
