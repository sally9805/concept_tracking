Colorado 's Democrats last week put forth their idea of what the well-dressed 1944 candidate will wear . Their choice was a bemedaled uniform occupied by a wounded young Air Force Major , Carl Eugen ( " Kayo " ) Wuertele , 30 . Major Wuertele ( pronounced Wurtell ) was at Pearl Harbor when the Japs came over . In 205 combat missions since , he collected five wounds and seven decorations , including the Distinguished Flying Cross . His Flying Fortress , Hel-en-Wings ( for his wife , Helen ) fought over Midway and Bougainville . In the Solomons , he shot down four Jap planes , had his own left foot nearly shot off . <P> Earnest , boyish Wuertele convalesced in Denver 's Fitzsimmons Hospital . Soon he began limping around to war plants , large &; small , on morale assignments . In one year he made 250 appearances , hundreds of acquaintances . Denver already knew him from his football days at the University of Colorado , and from the amateur boxing contests which earned him his nickname . But since Jan. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him for Congress , no candidate has ever been so completely muzzled . Until his discharge from the Army ( expected this week ) , he is forbidden to politick . So Democrats have sheltered him from photographers , have booked no speaking dates , opened no headquarters . They even hustled him off to Wichita to keep him out of sight . <P> Democrats sorely need a winner in the special election March 7 . Until his death in December , Congressman Lawrence Lewis was the lone Colorado Democrat in Congress . The First District is traditionally Republican . The Republicans , with a two-week head start in campaigning , have a strong candidate in Dean M. Gillespie , 59 , who grew rich from cheese , oil and trucking , is a political adept . <P> In this obscure by-election , the nation 's politicos could hold a mirror to the future . War Hero Wuertele plumps for servicemen 's issues ( " If they draft soldiers , why not draft everyone ? " ) . He covers his lack of political and business experience by an engaging candor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know anything about . . . . I do n't owe anybody anything , so when I figure out what a man ought to do , I can go ahead and do it . " To offset the war heroics , Gillespie 's backers are trying out the slogan of World War I 's nurse Edith Cavell : " Patriotism is not enough . "
