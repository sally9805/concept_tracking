a talk on what the Farm Bureau could do for the farmer and urged everybody to go out and get new members and we all sang " America " and filed out . The Co-operative Idea s we drove out of town under a last quarter of moon that shone wanly on cobwebby tangles of mist among the trees in the hollows , the Farm Bureau organizer said apologetically that this county we had just been in was one of the worst in the state from the point of view of farm organizations . In this state , he went on to explain , the Farm Bureau was n't so political as it was in the South . They were building the most progressive set of consumers ' co-operatives in the country . Already their gas stations sold enough gasoline to set the price for the whole state . They were on the point of buying a factory to build farm machinery . When they got that going it would help keep prices down for the nation . I must n't think this county was typical . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building of the Farm Bureau co-operatives , as I had that morning , without getting the impression of an immense going concern . This blue-eyed young man who had invited me to come along on part of his organizing trip was a Virginian . After working his way through college he had got a scholarship to go abroad and study the co-operative movement . He 'd been in England , France , and Sweden just before war broke out . He 'd stayed on in Sweden for a while after the shooting started . Everywhere he 'd seen selfgovernment and individual liberty , everything we had been brought up to prize in this country as making life worth living , going down the drain . How could we keep that from happening here ? was what he 'd been asking himself ever since . Of one thing he was sure . No human institution ever stood still . It either grew and progressed or else it decayed . That was why the conservatives were always wrong because what they were trying to conserve was always spoiling on their hands . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought that if anybody could bring self-government back to life in this country the farmers could . In this state they had really inspired leadership , he thought . The plan was to build up consumers ' co-operatives for economic self-help at the same time as they built up a political lobby to influence legislation . He did n't think one could go ahead very far without the other . There was one interesting development I ought to know about . . . . Now in his opinion one of the great mistakes of Farm Bureau leadership was opposition to labor . There was just no doubt that farmers were naturally prejudiced against labor organizations . Nobody had ever convinced the farmer that he had anything to gain from high industrial wages . But in this new development he saw a chance of bridging the gap between them . There was springing up in this state a chain of cooperative stores operated by labor unions in the cities which bought their products directly from the farmer . It had begun with poultry . These stores cut out the middleman 's expenses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the union man the lowest possible price . Outside of the expense of hauling , they shared between them the entire markup of the commission merchant , the retail storekeeper , the jobber , the wholesaler . More important than the economics of it was the fact that it constituted a bridge between farmers and workers in the industrial cities . " That 's the sort of thing 1 call practical politics , " he said . The Farmer Loves to Produce 447 AM seventy-four , " said the hawk-faced A whitehaired man as he let himself down from the wagon piled high with corn where he 'd been fixing a sideboard . He grunted as he straightened up in his neatly patched blue overalls and put his hand to his back above his lean hip . " Ouch . . I 'm beginning to find the work heavy . " He pointed to the new mechanical loader that was hitched behind the wagon . " Boys bought me that . They think I 'm too old to lift the corn up into the wagon . Never could have gotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand away from his back , wiped it on his overalls , and walked slowly toward us with the hand outstretched . We were standing beside a highway in the western part of Ohio on a semicircle of grass heaped with red-brown leaves from the horse-chestnut trees in front of the big mansarded house with broad porches . Whenever any one of us moved , the leaves crunched crisply underfoot . He was a tall slender man , remarkably straight for his age . After shaking hands the old man stood quietly looking us over for a moment out of sharp blue eyes between narrowed red lids . " Well , the government said they wanted production and by gum we 'll give it to ' em if it kills us , " he said . " By the way , how 's Pete Hawkins ? " he added looking toward the Dane who accompanied me . " Those cornpickers are nasty things . Never put your hand near ' em without stopping the motor ; that 's the rule here . " " He 's gone to the hospital , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ badly mangled . " " Picking some stalks out of the snappers that looked like they 'd stick , I suppose . The hired man over at the Children 's Home got a piece taken out of his finger that way only yesterday . Lucky he did n't lose it . We are so shorthanded around here we ca n't afford to have accidents . Well , we 've planted eighty acres of wheat and we 've picked six thousand bushels of corn , just me and the two boys . All this machinery costs a heap of money but it surely does the work . If we ca n't get labor we 've got to buy machinery . If we buy machinery we 've got to get prices to pay for it . " " Well , before lung we 'll have co-operative machinery , " said the Dane . " They wo n't be able to cut prices much . " " If it 's a co-operative the price wo n't matter . The profits will go back to the membership . " " They will if it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see it 's run right , " said the Dane , warming up . " The farmers around here do a pretty good job running their farms . There 's no reason on earthwhy they ca n't run a few enterprises , " he went on , his voice rising as he spoke . " Look at me . I 've done both . I 've kept a store and I 've worked for cooperatives and I tell you storekeeping 's a whole lot easier and a whole lot less satisfactory to the spirit of man . " " I 'd surely like to see the whole agricultural program taken away from the government , " said the old man with a blue flash in his eye . " You would n't want to see it fall into the hands of the Wall Street bankers , would you ? Then we 'd get our hides taken off for fair . " " I 've been through periods when the bankers ruled . I 've had ' em skin me alive like the rest of the folks . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that . " " But suppose the farmers ran their entire business for themselves ? Finance , furnishing of supplies , marketing right through to the consumer . . . " " I 'd like to see it properly managed . I certainly would like to be shown . " A shining black Buick towncar drove up and parked in the shallow ditch beside us . A young man in a dark business suit stepped out . " Folks , " he said , " I just stopped to hear if you knew about Pete 's hand . Down the road they are saying he may lose the whole hand . I hope it is n't as bad as that . " " I do n't think so , " said the Dane , furrowing his brow . " I 'm very much afraid he 'll lose some fingers , though . " The man in the business suit , it came out , ran a chicken hatchery and sold incubators and brooders . He was in the business in a big way . He 'd even been as far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When we asked him how he liked it , he said he 'd come back believing in private enterprise more firmly than ever . Of course , he admitted , smiling , an he 'd seen had been chicken farms and chicken officials and he did n't know any Russian . But what about co-operatives ? we asked him . What about democratically run business ? His face darkened . Had n't we had enough bureaucracy by this time ? he asked with impatience . We were up to our necks in it . You would think people would be sick of it . " Frankly I think business men contribute more to the community . That is if you give them a chance to make a profit . We pay better wages . I do n't mind a few co-operatives for the little fellows but I 'd hate to have them get their hands on everything . That 'd be as bad as the federal government . It 's the business men who contribute to community projects . " The Dane had a thoughtful look as we drove off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " that that man is a leader in our town in every committee for the public good . He 's one of the most publicspirited men we 've got . How can he be so shortsighted ? " A we drove further along the highway we could see the flashing perpendicular jaws of the cornpickers mounted on tractors moving down the rows . The tall ragged cornstalks fell trembling and were swallowed up . Yellow corncobs glowed in the sun as they plopped in a stream into the towed wagons . " One man can do in a day with one of those what five men did with a combine and what twenty men could do by hand . The weather looks almost too good , " said the Dane . " But the farmers are breaking their necks to get the corn in . Ca n't trust the weather this late in the year . " He had turned into a driveway that went to a neat narrow white house that sat up like a jackrabbit among smoothbaled walnut trees . Their last yellow leaves spun as they fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asking about stretching manpower , " the Dane said . " This lady runs a three-hundred-acre farm all by herself . Let 's ask her how she does it . " As we climbed out of the car a redfaced buxom woman in a Mother Hubbard and a blue poke bonnet came hurrying toward us from the barnyard , pulling off her workglovcs as she came . " I knew you were coming , Mr. Hansen , " she screeched , " but I just had to do some work in the garden . There 's so little time left . . . . Do come right in and sit down . " Panting , she fussed around us as she ushered us into her clean kitchen that smelt of apples and milkpans and coal oil . " This friend of mine wants to knowhow you do it , " said the Dane with his broad disarming smile . She sat down in a rocker facing us . As she talked she rocked fast . Well , she 'd been a widow for sixteen years so she 'd had to manage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any inclination to marry again . What she did was get a young boy as hired man and bring him up right . Of course people would talk if she got a man her own age living right here in the house with her , but shucks , this way she was like a mother to the boys . She 'd been very careful whom she picked , of course . She picked clean steady youngsters who did n't use tobacco or anything like that and they certainly had been marvels . This boy she had now was the third she 'd had . The other two had grown up and married and she 'd lost them . This boy she had now was going steady with a girl but she hoped she could hold on to him until the war was over anyway . He was a worker all right . The last two weeks he had been picking corn by day and plowing at night . He 'd rigged headlights on the tractor . Had to do a hide extra work when the country needed the production . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took it all . She sold her milk . The cows took a lot of feeding and what was left she fed to the hogs and the fowls . More profit that way . She had to buy feed as it was and my it was scarce . She 'd done right well with her hogs . Shipped them at the end of six months . The last lot the boy had shipped into Kansas City had been so fine the dealer had given her a premium on them . She heard it over the telephone . . . " I slid down like I was about to faint . The boy said , ' Let 's shake . I fed ' em . ' . . That boy sure can feed hogs . " A tall young man with dark eyes and brows in a face crimson from the outdoors stood pulling off his gloves in the back doorway . When he noticed it was he that we were talking about his red face went even redder . " I bet your ears are burning , " the Dane said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Maybe you can tell us how one man and a tractor can take care of three hundred acres . " " Well , " the young man said after a long pause , " I let the tractor do the work . " " How about next year ? " " Do n't hurt to hope . We ca n't feed no more stock . We got no more stable room . We 're aimin ' to shift to beef cattle a little . It 's gettin ' so hard to get mash but we 're aimin ' to produce a little more feed ourselves . We grind our own corn . " He showed a set of broad white teeth in a grin . " The tractor does the grindin ' . . . Well , I 'm glad to met you folks , " he said , coming forward gravely to shake hands again . " 5 better be gain ' about my business .

We followed the ruts along the edge of the thicket that marked a winding silty brown brook until we came to the first tall rows of corn . The big ears hung so heavy they seemed about to break out of their dry gaping shucks . We walked along the edge of the cornfield toward the roar of the tractor 's exhaust and the whir of metal until we came out on an open space of wrecked and trampled stalks where the picker had been through . He was coming toward us down the rows , sitting up high on the seat of the tractor while the cornstalks bowed trembling and crumpled and vanished between the shining steady shears . Right at our feet he stopped the tractor and jumped down from the seat . The roar of the motor and the clatter of the picker stopped . The cornfield was all at once immensely quiet . We could hear the cawing of crows along the hedgerow . Without looking at us he knelt in front of the picker and began yanking pieces of tough stalk from between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned and walked toward us , pulling off one heavy work glove as he came . He greeted my companion and we shook hands . He was a tall grave man with clear gray eyes . The stubble on his cheeks and chin was gray . When he pushed back hissweaty denim cap to look at us better he exposed a tall white forehead much paler than his ruddy windburned nose and cheeks . The Dane , possibly to bring him out , asked him how he was stepping up production for war . Standing very still and straight , he looked at us steadily and unsmilingly for a moment . Then he said quietly and without warmth , as if he were answering the silly questions of a couple of children , " We know that this thing is not of God , but it does not go against our conscience to get production out of the land . " A smile almost flickered round the corner of his thin wide obstinate mouth . " You ca n't make a farmer happier than by offering him a good price and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Dane stammered a little when he explained that I was trying to find out how all this effort for production was going to affect the growth of the county cooperative . The farmer stood there straight and tall with his feet a little apart and his arms hanging easily at his sides for a full minute before he answered . " You know very well that it is my opinion that we farmers should do for ourselves what the government is doing for us and doing very badly with a political purpose , " he said . " This is a time of organizations . We farmers must develop organizations to protect our families and the things we hold dear . " " Do you think we are succeeding ? " " You have the figures in the office . Why do you ask me ? " He pointed with a long blackened forefinger at a cloud that was spreading over the dappled sky above the bare trees at the end of the cornfield . " That 's rain , " he said . " A little rain will help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long spell of rain would spoil the crop . I 'm too busy today to talk of politics . " He fixed his level gaze on my face . " You must excuse me . We speak plain here , " he said . " If you could come back when the crop is in we should have time to talk . " He lifted one arm in a gesture of dismissal as he turned and strode back to the tractor . The whirring roar of machinery drowned our voices out . We turned and walked back along the ruts toward the house . " He 's the best fanner in the county , " said the Dane in an apologetic tone when we were enough out of earshot to hear our voices . " I can see why , " I said . III - Westward the Course HE train crossed the Mississippi in a flurry of snow . The line curved onto a levee along the edges of a great still backwater here and there blurred with snow , here and there streaked with blue from reflected patches of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swirl of muddy water ; then ran through a little wood . Beyond the smooth boles of the trees you could see the river and against the pale bluff opposite a little town that seemed to be on an island of green grass . There was a row of tall vase-shaped elms in front of some stately old white houses and a church with a slender pointed steeple . It was like one of the old untouched towns left over from the good times of New England . As the train lurched round another curve the little town vanished like something seen in a dream . Meanwhile the heavy-set man with sunken eyes beside me was talking and talking in a deep husky voice in my ear . " The man in the White House was all right , " he was saying , " to tide us over the depression . What we needed in those days was compromise , temporizing , finagling . He gave the country time to get its breath and to find its way around in the modern age that came on too soon for us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man of conviction . Such a man will rise up suddenly when the people need him , the way Lincoln rose up out of the people , the way Bryan rose up out of the people . . . .

I believe he 's got to come from the West . " The Wisconsin Drift AT do folks around here think about ? Why they think about corn , corn and hogs , but corn mostly , " drawled my friend in his ingratiating singsong . Ile was a large sandy-haired man with a large frame loosely put together and a large belly and large powerful arms and large irregular features linked together by thoughtful lines in a triangular ruddy face . Sprawling at the table in the lunchroom over his second cup of coffee he had the look he often had of being just about to wriggle out of the workclothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persuasive expository way of talking . His manner was between that of a lecturer explaining the solution of a problem at a blackboard and that of a lawyer pleading with a jury . There was a disarming friendliness in his voice that had a way of dissolving objections before you brought them up . " Around here they are the durncst folks for growing corn , " he said . " They do n't know about much else . They get out of growing corn what other folks in the East get out of country clubs and the stockmarket and the international situation . " We were sitting in a small plain lunchroom on the short main street of a small plain central Iowa town on a creek in a region of broad slow lazy hills . The carefully scrubbed tables and counter and the chairs were plain and old . The fittings were seedy . The middleaged waitress had a brisk homely healthy look . The men hunched over coffeecups at the counter or meditatively dawdling round the tables were all in workclothes . Most of them wore high boots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street outside were splattered with brown mud . Everything was built for use in this town . " You are sitting right now " ? my friend went on with his lecture ? " plumb in the middle of one of the richest agricultural regions on the face of the earth , the Wisconsin Drift of black dirt . Since our grandfathers moved out here we 've been taking crop after crop off it without the slightest diminution in fertility . Instead of getting poorer the land is getting richer . I 'll tell you why it 's getting richer . We are just starting to learn to use fertilizer on this land . Hybrid seed corn has added about twenty bushels to the yield per acre . A number of years ago we used to hear a good deal about the Hundredbushel Club made up of fellers who had managed to grow a hundred bushels of corn to the acre . Now nobody talks about it any more . . too many members . . . . A hundred bushels is n't the average yet , not by a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , better tractors , better plows , the mechanical curnpicker , have increased the yield per man . . . .

" " The last one was laid away two years ago , " piped up a short blackeyed man with a chin full of black stubble who wore a turtle-neck sweater and overalls . " Even then it was an antique . Now one good man on a picker can bring in more corn in a day than nine men and twenty mules could . " He drank the last of his coffee . " Now suppose we go and take a look around . " He gathered himself slowly together and rose to his feet . " No , " he said gently , as I tried to pull out a dollar bill , " your Eastern money is n't any good here , is it , Ellen ? " The waitress , who was standing beside the table with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brightly and shook her head . I followed him &it; to his car and we drove slowly out Main Street and past the sparse bare trees of the little park at the end and crossed the bridge over the muddy creek already rimmed with ice . " You came just at the right time , " he was saying . " I got the last of my corn in yesterday . We 've got plenty of time today to loaf around a bit . . . . First we 'll swing around past the plant . " Hybrid Seed Corn H E drove down a side road past a row of small new white houses that had the constricted look of the houses on the cover of a builders ' supply catalogue andcrossed the railroad tracks and stopped in front of a long gray galvanized iron building . Behind it next to an elevator tower rose a volcano-shaped mountain of yellow cobs laced with tangerine color . He leaned back in his seat and stared at the pile with some satisfaction . " What do you think of that for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been carting ' em away every day . We burn ' em in the stoves here . . . . When I first went into the hybridseed-corn business eleven years ago folks thought I was crazy . I had the hardest time persuading the fellers around here to take a couple of bushels for a trial . Now we ca n't begin to fill the orders . . . . Folks make me tired when they talk about the frontier being gone . We are on a frontier all over this country . Even back East there 'd be frontiers if folks had the sense to look for ' em ? damn wonderful frontiers . . . You see , the corn goes in at the end over there and then it 's dried by hot air from mechanical blowers . Then it 's run through troughs where they sort out the grades , then it 's shucked by machinery and shot up into bins . Then we draw it off in bags and store it in that last building . That building at the end is jam-packed full of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . If we could fill a couple more warehouses like that we could fill all the orders we get . . . .

Farm Management " oi.rnes , " he was saying . " The only time folks worry about politics around here is when times are bad and they ca n't get a price for their corn ; other times they just naturally vote Republican . The way they 're messing up the corn-hog ratio in Washington is what is worrying me . They are going to bring about an acute shortage of feed in this country . . . . Now and then I get on the train and go to Washington and go around and try to lay down the law to the boys , try to tell ' em how things really are out where we produce the stuff . I 'm working against my own interests at that , arguing for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my interest to have a high price for corn . . ? but I get something out of it just the same . I get kind of an idea of what they are up to around there . That helps me in my business . " He brought the car suddenly to a halt at the corner of a dirt road that cut across the highway . His voice had a streak of impatience in it , unusual for him . " Now look at this feller . See what he 's done , " he said as he pointed to a farm that rolled in dun patches of pasture and blue-green strips of winter oats and great squares of wrecked stubble of harvested cornfields up over the gradual hills . " See , he 's got a little pasture in the corner near the house no bigger than a nickel . . . . Now his house lot 's all right , I do n't mind that , but you see he 's got some very good land there and he 's ruined it with nasty little crisscross fences . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn the tractor around . . . I aim for mile-long rows . " He turned and drove up the sludgy dirt road to the top of a hill and then he swung out into a field through a gap in the fence and drove uphill over the bumpy grass that had spread over the old furrows where corn had been planted . At the very summit he slowed down to a stop . " Let 's get out and stretch our legs a little . " We climbed out of the car beside a great stack of oatstraw . We were on the top of the highest hill around . In front of us a small unpainted farmhouse sagged black and vacant with gaping windows . Behind the house the great stretch of country rolled pale ochre toward blue hills along the horizon moving in slow undulations like an ocean groundswell in a calm . Here and there in a deeper hollow was a scrap of a bright blue pond or the green smudge of a swamp . My friend pointed vindictively at the house . " I 'll have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feller who lived up here was starving to death . . . . I hate to sec that . . . . No decent well . No barn . It 's quite easy for folks to starve to death on the richest land in the world if they do n't manage it right . Now the first thing I do when I get hold of a piece of land is pull out the fences and knock the houses down andcart ' ens away . We got to have space to operate our machinery . Do you notice the roads ? When this country was laid out years ago they laid out roads a mile apart each way . A square mile ought to be the unit for growing corn in this country . Then you can cultivate sixty-five acres a day along mile-long rows . " He turned and pointed in the other direction . " You see over there there 's a gully beginning to wash . That 's a bad business . What we do is to put in an earth dam and fix it so that the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top . You 'd be surprised how soon the space behind the dam will fill up with mud . When it has filled up to the top you raise the dam and set your pipe higher up and in three or four years your gully is filled up fiat as your hand and you 've got a field you can operate with . Well , I know what you 're going to say , what about the tenants ? All you big-hearted folks back East arc worked up about the tenants . . . Let 's move on . It 's getting chilly . I 'm going to show you a tenant . " We drove down the hill to the main road again . " Now I 'm going to take you to see a tenant who has put twenty-five thousand dollars in the bank in two years . I know because he is under my management . Of course I admit he 's got one of the best farms in the country .

Of course he 's a lively young feller who works from before dawn till after dark and who 'll do what you tell him . We used plenty of fertilizer . Some folks would rather lose money than invest a couple of thousand dollars in chemical fertilizer . One way I keep the boys interested is to lay bets with ' em . I bet ' em such and such a piece of land wo n't bring thirty bushels or forty-five or eighty , say , according to what kind of land it is , and they 'll work their heads off to make a monkey out of me . I lose quite a little money that way . " He looked at me and grinned . " But it sure is worth it in bushels to the acre , " He turned off on another right-angle crossroad and drove up to a small plain white house . The barn in back was modest and the cowshed and outbuildings were in poor repair . A mildfaced lighthaircd young man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After we 'd asked about his wife , who had been feeling poorly , my friend started off : " Joe , that feeding floor 's in the wrong place . It 's unsightly . We do n't want your wife looking down into a hog trough every time she comes out the kitchen door now , do we ? Specially when she 's got one of the most beautiful views over the finest corn land on God 's green earth stretching out as far as she can see . I 'm goin ' to tear that cowbarn down and cart it away this winter and build you a decent one and a concrete feeding floor . . . One thing about farming , " he added in an aside to me , " that folks often forget is that you ca n't take out unless you put in . . . .

" I had two hundred and eighty acres in corn and sixty acres in oats and then there was sixty-five acres in flax and sixty-five acres in soy beans the government asked for and the hay . . . " He paused andstood looking out over the rolling land pallid with winter . We looked the way he was looking . A big red squirrel had come out of the tangled cornstubble and was venturing in a series of little quick runs along the fence . Three belated bluebirds fluttered up and darted away into the sky . " Well , say fifteen acres in hay . . . . The wife takes care of the garden . . . . Of course , " he added in a sober voice , " I did have a hired man some but the custom work I did for the neighbors with the tractor plowing and with the cornpicker picking corn just about balanced that up .

" As we drove back toward town my friend was saying , " And we have n't begun to produce in this country yet . Well , suppose we go and have us a cup of coffee and see what the boys have to say and then I 'll take you to see some really poor land , a farm I 'm taking over nobody ever could make a living on . I have a hunch that with proper cultivation and plenty of fertilizer I can make that grow corn just about as well as this good land . . . . I 'll have me a whale of a time trying anyway . . . I know you folks in the East are always saying the country 's going to the dogs . Maybe it is .
