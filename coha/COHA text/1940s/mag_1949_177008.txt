Radioactive isotopes are taking jobs in peacetime industry . Last week the California Research Corp . ( a subsidiary of Standard Oil Co. of California ) and the Atomic Energy Commission told now radioactive piston rings are being used to test the performance of lubricating oil . <P> Ordinary steel rings are put in the AEC 's atomic pile at Oak Ridge and " cooked " for a month in neutrons . The process changes part of their normal iron into radioactive iron 59 . Packed in 300-lb. lead cases , the " hot " rings are shipped to Richmond , Calif , and stored in a thick-walled closet ( called " the cave " ) in the Research Corp . ' s basement . <P> When a labman wants one of the dangerous rings , he takes it out of the cave on the end of a three-foot stick . Working carefully , with special tools , skilled mechanics fit the ring onto the piston of a test engine . After the engine has run for a few hours , its lubricating oil becomes radioactive because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As little as one-millionth of an ounce of metal can be detected in the oil . The scientists can tell by measuring the oil 's radioactivity just how much the ring has worn-and therefore how efficient the oil is.
