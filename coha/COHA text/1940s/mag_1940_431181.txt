 | Remember the Alamo By Edwin Muller TEXANS KNOW the value of freedom . There was a time when they did n't have it . They were under the iron-handed rule of a foreign dictator until 1836 . Santa Anna was , in some ways , a dictator like the current model . Not long ago in Hitler 's newspaper , the Volkische Beobachter , appeared an article highly commending the Mexican ruler , bitterly condemning the Americans who fought against him . It 's easy to see how Hitler could feel an interest in the other 's career . Santa Anna was a champion rabble-rouser . He had hot , passionate eyes that hypnotized an audience ? could work himself into a hoarse , screaming rage . He could coldly calculate all the factors of a situation . He knew how long to use a friend and how to dispose of him afterward . He was never troubled by a conscience . When 400 Texans surrendered to him at Goliad he ordered them shot in cold blood . Santa Anna was elected president of Mexico in 1833 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Many Mexicans think of him now with shame and he is not highly praised in their history books . Of course there were risings against him . But one by one Santa Anna beat down the rebellious provinces . All except Texas . This was a land newly settled . Spanish conquistadores and French adventurers had passed through it in the early days . But they had left little trace . Even after Mexico threw off the Spanish rule in 1821 and Texas became part of Mexico , few Mexicans could be found to settle it . To them it was an arid wilderness where there was little profit and much danger . Great bands of Comanches swept over it hunting bison . Better to leave it as a noman's-land , a barrier to the growing power of the United States . But there were others who felt differently . The Mississippi Valley was hardly overcrowded in the 1820 's . Yet some of the settlers there already had the itch to move on . To these men came stories of the Texas prairies . Stephen Austin of St. Louis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anteeing freedom under its consti-tution . Other leaders got groups together and the migration began . Families and their goods moved in wagons across the plains or in homemade boats down the Mississippi . Some of them had n't many goods to move . It was still an age when an axe and a rifle were the ly absolute essentials for a setIcr . Many stopped on the way to plant and harvest corn . The Indians got some of them . By 1835 there were 30,000 settlers in Texas , 95 percent of them from the States . Today in Texas you see statues erected to these men . They stand in noble poses , on their faces an expression of saintliness . But there was little of saintliness in the foretat hers of Texas . They were a lough and turbulent lot . They irked hard , and they drank hard . Hwy fought the Mexicans , they ti night the Indians , they fought each other . They had violent likes and dislikes and the most violent of their likes was personal freedom , Above all they wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's what the ) got ? at first . - But Santa Anna fixed that . Hf followed the sound policy of die tators , that the best way to curl discontent at home is to lead at army against an enemy abroad . Thy Texans were foreigners ? also then were only a few of them and the : 1 would n't be hard to conquer . Setting to work to incite rebellion , Santa Anna abolished trial by jury , imposed excessive taxes , made the Catholic religion compulsory , made it unlawful to possess arms ? in a country where each isolated ranch had to defend itself against Indians . A Mexican company was sent to take an old brass cannon away from the town of Gonzales . That was the last straw . The men of Gonzales , like the men of Concord in 1775 , rose and put them to flight . The revolt ran across Texas like a prairie fire and in a few weeks the scattered Mexican garrisons were chased across the Rio Grande . Then Santa Anna began to draw his army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manifested itself . The free men of Texas , who had hastily formed a government , could n't get together on a plan of defense . Their commander-in-chief , Sam Houston , was a great leader , but they gave him no support or authority . Instead of an army there were only bands under semi-independent leaders . Meanwhile Santa Anna was on the march . The gateway to Texas was San Antonio . In February 1836 , it was held by a garrison of 80 men under Col. William B. Travis , 28 years old . As word of the Mexican advance spread , small groups began to drift into San Antonio ? for the defense of freedom . Also there was prospect of a rattling good fight .  | There came James Bowie , long a rebel against Mexico . David Crockett arrived , carrying his fiddle and his long Kentucky rifle . With him he brought a dozen Tennessee boys who , as he said , were fond of getting their spoons into a mess of this kind . Soon Travis had I s0 men . Across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old Spanish mission of the Alamo . Built in 1718 , it was now in ruins , but the surrounding wall still stood , eight feet high , three feet thick . Travis decided to use the Alamo as a fort . A good strategist would have retreated while there was time . Indeed , General Sam Houston had ordered the place abandoned . On the other hand , the civil government told Travis to defend it . If he could hold out , it might give the colonists time to organize their defense . On the morning of February 21 two scouts galloped into San Antonio . Before they had dismounted , the news was flying about the town . Santa Anna was but a few miles away . His army was far greater than anyone had thought , at least 2400 in the infantry alone . His artillery choked the road . Hundreds of his cavalry were deploying on the plain . Within an hour Travis had assembled his men and they were clattering over the wooden bridge that led to the Alamo . No one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , staggered - out of his bed and dragged himself onto a horse . A small group of noncombatants went along , the wife of Lieutenant Dickensen and her baby , three or four Negro and Mexican servants . Travis raced through the final preparations ? which would have been attended to earlier by a less devil-may-care commander . He drove in some 30 stray cattle , stored 90 bushels of corn . Before sundown the next day , the defenders saw Santa Anna marching into the town . He summoned the garrison to surrender . Travis answered him with a cannon shot . There was none of the aspect of doomed men about the Texans . That night , when sentinels had been posted , they lit a bonfire in the center of the enclosure , sang songs , played jig tunes . They talked cheerfully of the relief parties that would come . They made Bowie comfortable in his cot . Next day both sides got down to work . Santa Anna moved his troops out in a great circle . One by one his batteries opened fire . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ricocheting around the enclosure . The Texans replied with their own cannon , but more effectively with their rifles . They knew how t0 use those rifles . Through the first days Crockett kept a diary . It was a terse score card . An entry : " After dawn got five gunners . Took my bitters . Went down to breakfast . "  | But Santa Anna kept sending ' tacking parties . The defenders , speading themselves thin to cover 400 yards of wall , could get no rest . Their eyes were red-rimmed ; they staggered from lack of sleep . Travis had sent for help . On the darkest night three scouts had hopped softly over the wall and trawled away . Travis had listened long ? had heard no shots or com-motion . For several days he waited anxiously . The attack increased in intensity . On the sixth night the sentinels heard outside a preart ranged signal . Shadowy figures rose up in the darkness , came charging in , piling over the walls . There were 32 of them , practically all the ablebodied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the wondering Mexicans heard high celebration that night in the Alamo . But the days went by and no more came . The attack kept on . The skin of the defenders ' faces was drawn tight over the bones . They had fixed stares , dozed and jerked themselves awake . Another scout came back ? alone . Then the last scout . His report was final . No help could come in time . Travis assembled his men . On the ancient flagstones the dust lay thick . With his sword he drew a line . He spoke to them simply . If they stayed it was unlikely that any p would get out alive . But they had seen how easily the scouts had gone out . He pledged himself to help without reproach any who elected to escape . As for himself he meant to stay . Anyone who wished to stay with him should step across the line . While he spoke the Texans had listened impassively . When he had finished they rose as one and crossed the line . There was a cry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out his hands to them . At his command they lifted the cot and carried it across . After that the action moved swiftly to a climax . There was a lull on the twelfth day but that night the Texans heard the rumbling of troops moving up into position . All night the noise went on while the men on the walls dug their nails into their flesh to keep awake . At dawn on March 6 there was one shrill blast of a bugle . Then a mounting roar from thousands of throats . In the gray half-light the lines were moving forward , long waves crested with bayonets . Behind the attackers other Mexicans were stationed to shoot down any who flinched . Behind them the cavalry circled to cut down any Texans who might escape . Farthest back of all , Santa Anna looked 0n . One assault was thrown back ? another ? another . But the defenders were too few . At last a breach was made in the west wall and the inn nr 9 . L  | Mexicans came pouring in like waters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chaos . In the choking clouds of gunpowder smoke , struggling groups swayed back and forth . One by one the Texans dropped and were trampled into the blood-soaked dust . Travis fell among the first . A few survivors made their last stand in small rooms of the old church . Crockett met his end in one of these rooms . Around his body were 17 Mexican corpses . Bowie fired his pistols , propped on his elbow in his cot . He was trying to raise his knife when the bayonets plunged into him . Except for the noncombatant group , there were no survivors . The news leaped across Texas . Its effect was instantaneous . It whipped into action the lagging processes of democracy . In a few weeks Sam Houston , the " colossus in buckskin , " had his army . There were less than a thousand , but that was enough . Santa Anna , full of confidence , divided his forces to mop up separate communities . That was what Houston wanted . He attacked the dictator on April 21 , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Remember the Alamo , " the Texans surprised the Mexicans while , General Santa Anna was taking his ' siesta . It was all over in 20 minutes , one of the shortest decisive battles in history . Afterward one of Houston 's troopers found a man in a Mexican pri-vate 's uniform crawling through the grass . He yanked him up by the scruff of the neck and brought him to Houston . It was Santa Anna . Some of the Texans wanted to kill him then and there but Houston would have none of that . Santa Anna did n't matter any more . Texas was free . TODAY ONE HEARS reports that Hitler is making promises down in 1 Mexico ? as the Kaiser did in 1917 . He tells them that when the United States falls apart ? as a decadent democracy must ? he may help Mexico to get back its lost province of Texas . It 's hard for a dictator to learn some things .                   @ @
