Big U.S. corporations are still doing fine . But the profit line chalked out for them by taxes , price ceilings and increased production costs has taken a downward dip for many . The National City Bank 's profit figures on 300 leading corporations , for the first nine months of 1944 , showed : a 6% increase in profits , after taxes , over the similar 1943 period , with combined sales up 11% . Of the 300 companies , 140 reported higher profits this year , while 160 were down . <P> But there were at least two notable deviations from the norm . The 13 petroleum companies increased both sales and earnings by a resounding 27% over last year . In contrast , the steel industry sweated out a new record of 67 million tons but took a 9% cut in profits . Thus steel earnings continued their two-year drop . <P> Like a page from the past was Atlantic Refining 's third-quarter report . Earnings for the nine months rose to $10.6 million - almost twice the 1943 figure . Atlantic directors declared an extra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voted its first extra dividend since 1941 from earnings of $38.9 million , up almost $10 million over the similar 1943 period . <P> The steel companies consoled their stock holders with the usual dividends , and a recital of unusual achievements . U.S. Steel upped its sales to a new high of $1.5 billion . But its $89 million sales increase was more than offset by higher costs . After paying taxes of $74 million ( v. $79.5 million in 1943 ) , the Corporation 's nine months ' net was $49.3 million against $54.3 in 1943 . <P> Bethlehem Steel did a little better than U.S. Steel . With its steel division straining at 103% of capacity , and enough launchings to cut its huge $2 billion of unfilled ship orders by a third . Bethlehem squeezed its earnings up slightly to $19.8 million . Republic , Inland and Jones &; Laughlin all reported lower profits . <P> Many consumer-goods industries also saw profits shrink from last year . Textile-company earnings were down 12% ; food companies , unable to outfoot rising costs , were down 5% . General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $209 million . Their $28 million increase in sales was just matched by a $28 million increase in the cost of sales . <P> But each third-quarter tally sheet carried more if , and , or but footnotes than a timetable . Not until the year 's end , when reserves and taxes are adjusted and contracts renegotiated , will company accountants know for sure whether 1944 profits will be greater or less than last year's.
