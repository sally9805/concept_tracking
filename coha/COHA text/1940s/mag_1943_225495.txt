Laid out cold the year before , Broadway jumped nimbly to its feet this past season . With playwrights less paralyzed by the war , and the public less panicky , quality rose and box office soared . Offering the fewest new productions of any modern season , 1942-43 achieved the highest percentage of successes ( 22 out of 57 ) in Broadway history . <P> Of the 22 , only one-The Eve of St. Mark-dealt seriously with the war ; only three others-The Patriots , Harriet and Tomorrow the World-dealt seriously with anything . Entertainment held the field . Thornton Wilder 's cockeyed The Skin of Our Teeth started ten thousand arguments , sold a quarter of a million seats and won the Pulitzer Prize . Oklahoma ! , musicomedy 's least orthodox offering in years , was also its most charming and successful . As Rosalinda , Johann Strauss 's 6g-year-old , waltz-drenched Die Fledermaus became a surprise smash . <P> Broadway 's threatened manpower shortage never became acute-even among chorus boys . But the theater lost several first-string critics to the war ( the Times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , World-Telegram 's John Mason Brown , Sun 's Richard Lockridge ) . <P> Hollywood did its heaviest backing in years , its heaviest buying in history : 20th Century-Fox paid an estimated $300,000 for The Eve of St. Mark , $265,000 for Something for the Boys ; Warner Bros , advanced $250,000 against all profits on This Is the Army , paid $250,000 outright for Dark Eyes , The Doughgirls ; Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer $260,000 for Without Love . Columnist Leonard Lyons quoted Hollywood 's Nunnally Johnson : " All the film companies got together and agreed not to pay less than $250,000 for any play . " With gas rationed , Broadway expects a terrific summer . Cracked Walter Winchell : " There is talk that Harold Ickes ' picture will soon replace Edwin Booth 's in all the actors ' clubs .
