There are only 18 locomotives on the whole 239 miles of the Toledo , Peoria &; Western R.R. , but some day they may pull every U.S. railroad out of the woods-that is , if the T.P. &; W. loses a few more labor battles such as it lost last week . <P> The T.P. &; W. is another name for G. P. McN . ( George Plummer McNear Jr. ) , who owns it-track , ties &; rolling stock ( TIME , May 18 ) . As a result of last week 's decision by a Government-appointed arbitrator , G. P. McN. will have to pay $3,200 a month more in wages , and the Government has still got his railroad . But the sacrosanct featherbed rules of the Railroad Brotherhoods-the rules which make the carriers pay for all sorts of unnecessary work-had taken a disastrous shaking-up . <P> The shaking started a year ago when the Brotherhoods demanded their nationwide 30% wage boost . G. P. McN. , like the other roads , agreed to part of the raise . But unlike the others , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roared he : " A day 's work for a day 's pay . " So last December his engineers and trainmen struck . So G. P. McN. went on running his railroad as usual , except that he used only 55 trainmen instead of 83-the number which the Brotherhoods ' featherbed rules would have required for the same work . <P> Right there G. P. McN. made his big mistake . He found , as Air Associates ( TIME , Nov. 10 ) had found before him , that beating a strike is not healthy so long as the Administration feels the way it does about labor and has wartime powers with which to crack down . After George McNear had refused to arbitrate ( as the Brotherhoods had refused to arbitrate with the railroads a year before ) , President Roosevelt declared that there was an " emergency " on the G. P. McN . This was startling : the road was running , it was paying high wages , it even had a waiting list of men who wanted jobs . But the Government took over the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire . The Brotherhoods beamed . <P> The beam soon vanished . The Government as successor of G. P. McN. agreed to arbitration . At hearings in Chicago during May and June some amazing figures came out : under McNear 's " day 's work for a day 's pay , " T.P. &; W. 's wage bill in April was $18,478 . The Office of Defense Transportation figured out that under Brotherhood rules the bill would have been $56,711 . Badly jolted by this noncooperative ODT attitude , the Brotherhoods finally said their wage bill would have been $31,000 ( still 70% over McNear 's figure ) . The Government-appointed arbitrator hastily called a two-week recess " so the boys can get their signals straight . " <P> The arbitrator last week finally settled with the Brotherhoods , but most of the stuffing had been taken out of their featherbed . The Brotherhoods were awarded wage rates and working rules which would have put the April payroll at $21,678-$3,200 more than McNear 's operating cost . <P> To most U.S. railroad executives the whole affair was utterly fantastic . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slashed their demands by 75% . Not in decades had a big road extracted more than a handful of fluff from the Brotherhood featherbed . There was only one big hitch : G. P. McN. was still minus his railroad .
