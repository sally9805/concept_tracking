txt Mrs. Evalyn Walsh , a leader in Washington society for many years and owner of the famous Hope diamond , died tonight at 6:15 in her home here . She was in her sixtieth year . Death came at Friendship , where she had been ill with pneumonia for several days . For the last twenty-four hours she had been in ' an oxygen tent . The last rites of the Roman Catholic Church were administered ' by the Rev. Dr. Edmund A. Walsh , S. J. , vice president of Georgetown University . At the bedside , in addition to Father Walsh , were Dr. Bernard J. Walsh , the attending physician ; Mrs. Eleanor Patterson , publisher of The Washington Times-Herald ; Associate Justice Frank Murphy of the Supreme Court , former Circuit Court Judge Thurman Arnold , Mrs. 's attorney ; former Senator Robert R. Reynolds of North Carolina , her son-in-law , and Mrs. 's secretary , Miss Nannie Chase . Mrs. was the former wife of the late Edward Beale , one-time publisher of The Washington Post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Texas , and Edward Jr . of Colorado Springs , were on the way hereitonight . Surviving also is a granddaughter Mamie Spears , Reynolds , 4-year-old daughter of former Senator Reynolds and the late Mrs. Evelyn Reynolds . Mrs. , resolute owner of the " jinxed " Hope diamond , devoted her fortune and most of her adult life to planning gaiety for others while her oven life was // racked by tragedy after tragedy . The Washington socialite scoffed at suspicions that her personal unhappiness was oaused by the $2,000,000 diamond . The pale blue gem was blamed for bringing ill luck to scores of previous owners , including Catherine the Great of Russia and Marie Antoinette of France . But Mrs. said simply that she and her wealthy husband never had a chance because they were not taught the discipline needed to handle great fortunes . Mrs. inherited her millions from her father , the late Thomas F. Walsh , an Irish millwright who struck a fabulously rich gold vein in Colorado . She was born in Denver m 1886 , and was married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that published The Cincinnati Enquirer and The Washington Post . Mr. gave the 441/2-carat Hope Diamond to his blue-eyed wife . But the gift seemed as ill-omened as it was elegant . Their marriage broke up with Mrs. charging her husband with adultery , . and Mr. eventually died in a mental institution , his fortune dissipated . Their eldest son was killed by an automobile . Their daughter died of an overdose of sleeping tablets which the coroner ruled was taken accidenally . They were innocently involved in side issues of the Teapot Dome scandal and the Charles Lindbergh kidnapping case . All this time  --  and all of her life , tor that matter  --  Mrs. tried to please others . Sometimes it was by giving a $50,000 party for Washington society . Once it was by providing a waterjug for people she saw waiting in the sun for buses . When a host of veterans descended on the nation 's capital in 1932 to press their demands for bonus payments , Mrs. supplied them with food and circus tent shelter . During both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fortune to help wounded and sick soldiers . Shortly after the United States entered the first world conflict , she turned over her seventyfive-acre estate , Old Friendship ? once a monastic retreat  --  to the Red Cross bar a convalescent home . In the second World War her new and less pretentious residence , known simply as Friendship , also was thrown open on frequent occasions to disabled soldiers and their friends . Both " Friendships " furnished the settings for some of the capital 's most lavish social functions . On a typical evening , Mrs. would invite some 200 guests to dine in rooms bedecked with thousands of dollars worth of out-ofseason flowers . There would be choice liquors , two nationally known orchestras , sometimes the complete cast of a Broadway hit , an unreleased movie or a prima donna . Even Old Friendship was too small for Mrs. 's overflowing hospitality . Once , in preparation for a New Year 's Eve ball , she had more rooms added to the already spacious residence . Harding Frequent Visitor Her home was usually filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequent visitor . So were other dignitaries of this and foreign nations . Her guest lists- were always unpredictable and more than once political enemies , or Supreme Court Justices and labor leaders sat at ithe same table . But Mrs. never was accused of currying favor with any of her guests . She would not accept even so much as a return invitation . The were such social arbiters that they never went out  --  they only received . Probably none of her entertaining brought her as much pleasure as the biweekly parties she gave during 1945 and 1946 for disabled G.I. 's from Walter Reed Hospital and their girl friends . In between parties , Mrs. visited the sick and wounded men at the hospital . Then she would return home to rest and conserve her frail health for the evenings when she wined and dined them royally at Friendship . They came in busloads of fifty with their sweethearts and wives to partake of Friendship 's excellent food and champagne and to dance and drink beer and cokes the evening through . Many of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kicked back priceless oriental rugs to dance stiffly on new artificial limbs . Throughout the evening Mrs. moved among them , signing autographs , spreading cheer and listening to troubles . She was with them , too , for the evening 's highlight ? the group photograph that was theirs for the asking when prints were ready . Often on those nights the Hope diamond gleamed on some G.I. 's tunic or against the bosom of his girl friend . No matter how elaborate the party or how noted the guests , the fabled gem commanded attention . She wore it almost constantly , whether she was going to the movies or on . a. tour to Russia . In Moscow , the diamond once roused the memories of czar-hating revolutionaries so that Mrs. was genuinely fearful of violence . Violence Strikes It was in the United States that violence actually struck . The 's first son , Vinson , known as the " hundred-million-dollar baby , " eluded many bodyguards and elaborate alarm systems to slip into the street one day . He was fatally injured by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' . That was in 1918 , when Vinson was eight . Mrs. 's friends told her to get rid of the cursed Hope diamond . She replied that.she already had suffered the greatest tragedy that the stone could bring her . When Mrs. herself curfered a broken leg in an automobile accident , she kept the diamond under her pillow . She liked to yank it out and show it to visitors . She pawned the cherished stone when her husband 's fortunes dwindled and he was losing The Washington Post . She was unable to save the paper from sale on the auction block in 1933 , so she redeemed the diamond . ( Eugene Meyer bought The Post and reestablished it as one of the nation 's leading newspapers . ) Mrs. had sought to save The Post for her children . The daughter in 1941 was married to the former North Carolina Senator , Robert R. Reynolds . She was his fifth wife .

She gave $104,000 to Gaston ' B. Means , confidence man , who convinced her that he could recover the stolen child of Col. Charles A. Lindbergh . When the child was found dead , and Richard Bruno Hauptmann was sent to the electric chair for the crime , Means was sentenced to fifteen years ' imprisonment for conspiracy . He died behind bars . The odor of the Teapot Dome scandal also drifted to Friendship and . the . When Secretary of the Interior Albert Fall was accused of accepting a $100 , - 000 bribe , he said he received the funds from Mr. said he gave Fall a check . Investigators f , ound the check had been returned uncashed . The ' marital break-up was as spectacular as the Hope diamond itself , Two years after their separation in 1929 , Mrs. . sought a limited divorce which would legally recognize the split . Mr. , however , went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1932 . One by one Mrs. gave up the family properties . The town house of her father-in-law , John R. , was razed to make room for the Reconstruction Finance Corporation Building . And a few days after the Pearl Harbor attack , Mrs. , acting in behalf of her children , sold Old Friendship to the Government for a housing project . But she kept the Hope diamond .
