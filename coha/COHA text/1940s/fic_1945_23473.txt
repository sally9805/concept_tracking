Alice Marriott is a student of the life of the /aorta Indians of Oklahoma . This story , based on fact , will be included in her forthcoming book , The Ten Grandmothers , THE WAR PARTY A Story from the Life ALICE MARRIOTT T big posters were out all over town , announcing that the Indian Fair would begin tomorrow . Phillip walked down Main Street and felt proud of his work ; he really liked the picture of the dancing man that he had designed for these posters . His grandfather and old Eagle Plume had looked at it a long time , and agreed that it was lifelike . You could always tell when a fair was going to begin , because the day before it started felt different from ordinary days . People began to come in well ahead of time , and they camped all over the two-acre field southwest of the Fair Grounds . The old people said it was n't like an old-time camp , but there was something about it that must have felt right to them , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the tipis that the old folks saved for occasions like this . It was a good thing they did put up tipis , or present-day artists would never know how to paint them . He turned into the post office . The little room at the end of the corridor had been turned over to the draft board . He walked under his own paintings and knew without looking at them where each one was . Buffalo hunt , travel , camping scene ? they could stand . They would be there when he was gone and when he got back , if he got back . The interview did n't take long . He 'd had his physical and was all ready to go . You could n't really say he had dependents . He sometimes helped his grandparents , with whom he lived , but that was just what anybody would do . When he was gone , they 'd get along all right . The others would help them then . The Sergeant said , " You have until tomorrow to finish things up . Be here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll give you boys a break , a ride in a jeep in the parade , and down to the station . " Phillip went down the steps more slowly than he ever had . Even when you knew it was coming and you had to do it , it was hard . He forgot his car and walked , walked eastward to the Fair Grounds and his grandfather 's camp . H UNTING HORST . sat in the tipi doorway , with old Eagle Plume beside him . It was not that they were such good friends , but being the two oldest men left living threw them on each other . Eagle Plume was almost blind and was getting deaf , but Grandfather had his sight and could hear well . He helped Eagle Plume along a lot of the time when the old man began to give out . " Get down , Grandson . " Phillip sat and rolled a cigarette for Eagle Plume and one for himself . His grandfather would n't smoke . It was wrong for a Christian , he said . Lots of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas . It was odd to get things mixed up that way . " Have you news , Grandson ? " " I 'm leaving tomorrow . " Hunting Horse turned to Eagle Plume . The older man always said he could hear Hunting Horse and Spear Woman because they spoke such good , clear Kiowa . The younger people just mumbled and forgot half the words . Now Hunting Horse spoke without raising his voice . " My grandson says he is going away to fight tomorrow . " " Is there a war going on ? Who are they fighting ? The Germans , like the last time ? " " The Germans again . And some other people , too , called the Japs . " " Those Germans , " said Eagle Plume , " make me think of the Navajos . No matter how many times you go out and lick the Navajos , after a while they grow more young men and come at you to be licked again . That 's the way those Germans are . Are the Navajos fighting on the German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on our side . " " Seems like a funny kind of business , Kiowas and Navajos fighting on the same side . Do n't let your grandson have much to do with the Navajos , friend . They might change their minds . " Phillip laughed at that , remembering Navajo boys at school who had been his good friends . Indians were getting to know and like each other because they were Indians . Indians had to hold together for that reason . That was what peyote religion taught , and it was right . Eagle Plume was talking again . " It 's a long time since any of us saw the young men ride out and fight . Will they make a ceremony for them ? " Hunting Horse glanced toward his grandson , and Phillip nodded . It would make the old men feel better about it . " Tomorrow . It 's a kind of a ceremony . When they have the Indian Fair parade , we 'll be in it . We 'll be riding in a special kind of car , all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll see us then . " " That 's good , " said Hunting Horse . " That 's the way it ought to be . Showing honor and respect for the brave young men . That 's the way we always did . " Eagle Plume put out his cigarette and sat there thinking . " Will you lend me a horse tomorrow , friend ? " What did the old man want with a horse , Phillip wondered . He was too shaky to stay on if he had it , and had sold all his own long ago . " Will you need it , friend ? " Hunting Horse 's politeness led up to all the things his grandson was thinking right out . " I 'm going to need it . I need it to ride in the parade and bless those young men . They 're going away to fight , and they ought to be blessed before they start out . I 'm the only one left that has the right . " " You are brave , too , to take that ride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Eagle Plume easily . " You think I 'm old and shaky and probably I 'll fall off . Well , I wo n't . I still have power , no matter how old I am . I can ride that horse if I 'm doing it to bless the young men . " " Thank you for blessing , friend , " said Hunting Horse . " I will give you that horse that you will ride . " " Tell your grandson to come here . He must give me another cigarette first . " Philip rolled the cigarette and passed it across , and the old man took it and blew smoke to the directions , the way he would with a pipe : east , south , west , north , up , clown . The smoke went over Philip . " Kneel down , young man . " He used a term Phillip had heard only when they were telling stories of the old days . It was an honorable term , and it really meant " young man who is going bravely out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the old man , sitting flat on the ground below him . Eagle Plume put his arms out and up , to embrace him . " This is the power that I have . This is the power that my brother got in the Sun Dance and gave me . It is good power and strong power . I 've had it a long time , and I 'll have it a while longer . This is the power to live until your ribs fall in and you die of old age . This is the power to go through war and sickness and all those bad things , and come out safe . This is the power I am giving this young man . " He took Phillip 's hands in his , and blew four times into the palms of each one . Four times on each of his feet . Four times over his heart . Then he made him get up and turn around and kneel down again , and blew four times in the middle of his back . " Now you have this power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will keep you alive through the fighting and bring you back to us safely . This is my gift to you , to keep the power going on . When you are as old as I am , you can hand it on to somebody else . " I T ISAD always sounded funny when they talked about handing on power , but maybe there was something to it . He did n't feel any different , but he knew he had been through a ceremony . He went into the tipi and lay down on his back and looked up at the ears to think , his knees up and one knee over the other , his foot swinging in time to his thinking . That was the best way to lie when you had to think . All the men he knew did it . Outside he could hear the voices of the two old men going on . They were making plans for the next day . Strange . They were the ones who were making the plans , and he was the one who would be doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the plans were made for you . Not like the old days , when each man made his own plan and worked it into one general plan for all to follow . You did n't take orders much , in the old kind of fighting . Now fighting was all taking orders . He went from thinking into sleeping without knowing it . When he waked , the voices were gone , and there was the throbbing of a drum along the earth from somewhere . He sat up and listened . That was a peyote drum . Nobody ever held a peyote meeting in this camp , though . It was too easily interrupted by white people who just wanted to know what was going on He went to the door of the tipi and looked out . The drum came from Packing Rocks 's camp . Packing Rocks 's deep voice went with it , singing a blessing song . When he stopped , the drum began again , not so strongly , and Eagle Plume 's old voice sang a song for strength and help . Phillip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believed in singing to give them power . When he roused again , it was morning , and Bow Woman , his grandmother , was bending over him . " You better get up , " she said . " I got food all ready for you to eat . " He went outside and sat with his grandfather while she brought the food to them . Meat and broth and fry-bread and coffee ? what the old people liked best in all the world . There were other things that he 'd rather have , but this was what they thought was the best food in the world . He ate it . Hunting Horse was dressed in a blue silk shirt . There were bright yellow yarns around his braids and a pair of beaded moccasins on his feet . He had put a spot of red paint on each cheekbone , and his long beaded pipe bag lay on the ground beside him . When they had finished eating , he stood up . " You better get dressed , Grandson . " " I got my clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I 'm leaving my good clothes . I wo n't need them . They 'll give me a uniform to wear . " " That 's not what counts . When you ride in a parade , you got to dress up . You got to look your very best . All the people are there to do you honor . You got to show them that you appreciate it . " It was a foolish way of looking at things , but the old man never would give up if he had his mind set on something like that . You might as well give in to him , because that was what you 'd end by doing . Phillip got his suitcase out from under his cot and took out his best bright blue suit and a clean white shirt . He had better put on a tie , too . The old man would expect it . He tied the few things he would take with him in a small bundle that he could carry . His grandfather would probably like to paint his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of it . But when he came out , Hunting Horse said nothing about that . He handed Phillip the lines of the horse he was holding , and said , " You 'd better take this over to Eagle Plume ! ' T WAS a good horse ; it was the best horse T 1 . he had , a bayo coyote . He took the bridle and led the horse across the camp to Eagle Plume . When he saw the old man , all Phillip could think of was that he was just right to go with the fine horse . All those years , Eagle Plume must have been keeping his Gourd Dancers ' Society costume . He stood now coated with yellow paint and with the long breechclout covered with crow feathers trailing behind him . There was a bundle of crow feathers tied in his hair , and all his hair but his scalplock was unbraided . The pink shell he always wore was still tied to the scalp-lock , but something else was tied to it so that it showed black in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black stone arrowhead . Eagle Plume took the horse . He thanked Hunting Horse and his grandson . One of Packing Rocks 's grandsons mounted to ride the horse into town , and the old man came across the camp and got into the wagon with the rest of them . Riding into town in the wagon was something Phillip had always done . The dust was deep along the road , powdering out over the camps that lined it and turning tipis and tents and brush arbors all the same red-brown . People and their clothing had the same color as their shelters . It should have flattened things out , but it did n't , because what was going on inside people was sharpened by excitement . They came to the place where people were lining up to be in the parade . Packing Rocks 's grandson was there already , with the horse . Eagle Plume got out of the wagon and sat on the grass by the side of the road , waiting . Color and movement sang without voice around them the rest of the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; all the gay , good things that meant the fair and gay , good feelings were around them thick . Somehow they even made the jeep look gay , but the Sergeant looked worried . " There , " he said , when he saw Phillip , " that 's the last one . Let 's get going . " They rode back through the singing color and movement that was the most important part of the world right now . Girls ' hair that shone ; and girls ' white buckskin dresses that gleamed like smoke against the blue sky . Silver ornaments and shell ornaments . Smell of sage and herbs for perfume . All the things that women knew how to use to make themselves beautiful . All at once Phillip knew that it was all these things that he was leaving , too . W HEN they got into line behind the Comanches , where they would be leading the Kiowas , Eagle Plume got up and went to his new horse . Phillip started to get out of the jeep ; then he saw that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He supposed the boy would go along and lead the horse , because it was pretty spirited , but Eagle Plume took the lines in his own old , small hands , that were still strong enough to hold them . There was a minute when they were all standing still , and then the band struck up and the parade started . It was a loud band , and it was right in front of the Comanches , so that the sound kept coming back over them in spurts . But it was n't that sound so much as another one that Phillip heard . He heard Eagle Plume singing the Journey Song . Going away on a journey , That 's the only thing . That 's the best way there is For a young man to make himself rich and famous . Some of the boys in the jeep knew that song , and riding along through the crowds and the morning , they all began to sing it too . When they had sung it four times , Eagle Plume began to talk to the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he told them . " This is what you are to see . These are the young men to give honor to . These are the young men who are going away to fight for you . They will go far away and fight with a strong enemy . Maybe some of them will get killed . Maybe some of them will be hurt . They are brave ; they are doing you honor , fighting for you . " Not all the people along the sidewalks knew what was happening . They thought at first it was a parade joke , like the Mud-Heads that were there every year throwing mud at the people . But the old man was in earnest . What he was saying was almost a prayer . Even the white people could feel that he meant it . Voices that had been raised and clamorous began to drop and become easy , and against them Eagle Plume 's voice rose more clearly . " This is the song that my father sang when he was killed . All the men that were with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone now . Nobody is left who has the real right to sing this song . But my father would want them to know . He would want these young men to hear his song so that they could fight bravely . This is a song that will make a man strong in fighting if he thinks about it . I live , but I will not live forever . Mysterious moon , you only remain , Powerful sun , you alone remain , ' Wonderful earth , you remain forever . " They were even with the courthouse , now , and Phillip could see his grandfather 's wagon and his grandfather standing up in it . His grandmother was doubled and twisted on the seat of the wagon as if something were hitting her and hurting her , but she straightened up when she heard Eagle Plume sing . Her eyes went down along the line of the parade and hit the jeep and found Phillip 's . For the first time in his life he was looking full into his grandmother 's face , and it was beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been lovely . She raised her chin and threw back her head and a sound cut through Eagle Plume 's song and finished it off . She was making the war-whoop for both of them . They went all through the town and came back to the edge of camp . Packing Rocks 's grandson came and took the lines and helped Eagle Plume dismount . The old man got down and came across the road to the jeep . " That is the best I can do for you , " he said . " All an old man can do for young ones is give them his blessing . I hope it 's strong enough to carry you through , and you all come back all right . " He shook hands with each of them and stepped back to the side of the road . " 0 K , boys , " said the Sergeant , " Start ' em rolling . "
