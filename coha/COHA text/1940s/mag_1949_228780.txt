Another monument to the strange economics of the Government 's price-support program ( see NATIONAL AFFAIRS ) was on view last week . It consisted of 4,000 tons of cottonseed , piled high on the concrete tennis courts of a former naval air station in Oklahoma City . Bought and paid for by the U.S. taxpayer ( through the Commodity Credit Corp. ) , the cottonseed seemed destined for the same fate as the mountains of potatoes , eggs and other commodities which the Government in the past has bought and let rot . <P> But cottonseed producers were happy . Southern Congressmen had pressured CCC to buy the seed from farmers at a support price of $46.50 a ton , higher than the local open-market price of $45 and under . Producers were , of course , the only ones happy . Processors , who turn the seed into cottonseed cake for cattle feed , com plained that they were unable to compete with the Government 's purchases and get the seed they needed . Result : there was a shortage , though possibly temporary , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ton in six weeks. * This naturally made beef cattle feeders the unhappiest of all . <P> As usual , the U.S. consumer would probably have to shell out twice . He was already paying for the support price ; by next spring he might be paying again in higher prices for steak . <P> <P> *Processors complained that they could not even buy from CCC 's stockpile ; the seed had not matured enough in the open air . By the time it does , deterioration from the weather may make it unusable.
