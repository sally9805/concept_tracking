Vienna once exported a type of musical comedy which brought the world much pleasure and had many virtues . Realism was not one of the virtues . Yet in the whirl of ravishing gypsies disguised as archdukes and ravishing archdukes disguised as gypsies there usually appeared a suggestion , not of life , but of how a generation thought life ought to be . <P> Such an operetta was The Dollar Princess ( 1907 ) which , sensitive to the march of history , turned its back on gypsies and archdukes and instead examined the American millionaire . Today , few people remember it except music publishers , sentimentalists , and the Russians , who last week began adapting The Dollar Princess for their own devices . <P> Love &; the Coal Trust . The Dollar Princess was Miss Alice Cowder , dashing daughter of John W. Cowder , president of the Coal Trust . Alice was a strong-minded girl , always abreast of stockmarket quotations . Of her it was said that " in any sort of weather , she works on all the while , until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " *Because her father liked to employ titled Europeans as footmen and office boys , Alice had acquired a rather low opinion of continental coronets ( " You bid the right amount-you own a duke or count " ) . <P> Presently , there appeared , from England , not a duke or count but plain Frederick George Cuthbert William Smythe , of the Smokeless Coal Smythes , who was determined to woo &; win Alice , partly for her looks and partly for her $20 million which would help stabilize the shaky family business . After announcing : " I 'll catch my little filly , I 'll tame her , willy nilly , right round the neck I 'll noose her and nevermore will loose her , " he got a job as Alice 's private secretary . For an act or so , Alice dodged his lasso . Then , in the second act finale where things started popping in the old Viennese operettas , Alice announced to a party of distinguished guests that she had picked Secretary Smythe to be her husband . Though at this point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When old Cowder offered him $50 million as an added inducement , Freddie sang with simple dignity : " I trample on your gold ... " Cowder : He scorns my daughter 's addresses ! Freddie : Thus do I treat all dollar princesses ! The Chorus : He wo n't consent ? Extremely queer He must be mad , it 's very clear . Alice ( weeping ) : Oh the disgrace , I can not bear it ... Freddie ( in lilting three-quarter time ) : Her every action confesses The fortune she is worth The proudest of dollar princesses- Is sometimes the poorest on earth ... ( Curtain ) <P> In the third act , the Coal Trust was in a bad way , chiefly because Old Man Cowder had ignored business for the sake of a Polish countess ( in reality no countess at all , but a lion tamer ) . Smokeless Coal , on the other hand , was flourishing , which evened things up-at least by the peculiar laws of Viennese musicals . Alice says : " Oh take me , love , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1907 ) went home , humming happily and concluding that Americans , while somewhat uncouth and acquisitive , probably had hearts of gold or , at least , coal .
