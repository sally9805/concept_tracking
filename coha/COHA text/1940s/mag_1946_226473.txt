( See Cover ) <P> The movies have produced one of their rare great works of art . <P> When Laurence Olivier 's magnificent screen production of Shakespeare 's Henry V was first disclosed to a group of Oxford 's impassive Shakespeare pundits , there was only one murmur of dissent . A woman specialist insisted that all the war horses which take part in the Battle of Agincourt should have been stallions . <P> <P> The film was given its U.S. premiere-this week ( in Boston 's Esquire Theater ) . <P> This time , the horses engendered no com plaint . At last there had been brought to the screen , with such sweetness , vigor , insight and beauty that it seemed to have been written yesterday , a play by the greatest dramatic poet who ever lived . It had never been done before. * For Laurence Olivier , 38 ( who plays Henry and directed and produced the picture ) , the event meant new stature . For Shakespeare , it meant a new splendor in a new , vital medium . Exciting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen by U.S. cinemaddicts in films like Rebecca and Wuthering Heights , his production of Henry V was even more exciting . <P> Shakespeare 's Henry V. As Shakesspeare wrote it , The Cronicle History of Henry the fift is an intensely masculine , simple , sanguine drama of kinghood and war . Its more eloquent theme is a young king 's coming of age . Once an endearingly wild Prince of Wales , Henry V ( at 28 ) had to prove his worthiness for the scepter by leading his army in war . He invaded France , England 's longtime enemy . He captured Harfleur , then tried to withdraw his exhausted and vastly outnumbered army to Calais ( see map ) . The French confronted him at Agincourt . In one of Shakespeare 's most stirring verbal sennets , Henry urged his soldiers on to incredible victory . English mobility ( unarmored archers ) and English firepower ( the quick-shooting longbow ) proved too much for the heavily armored French . <P> Casualties ( killed ) : English , 29 ; French , 10,000. * With victory came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courtship of the French Princess Katherine . <P> There were important minor touches . <P> In one of the most moving scenes in Shakespeare , Falstaff was killed off . To replace him , his pal , Pistol , the quintessential burlesque of the Elizabethan soul , was played far down to the groundlings . <P> Because in writing Henry V Shakespeare was much hampered by the limitations of his stage , there was heavy work for the one-man Chorus , who , in persuasive and beautiful verbal movies , stirred his audience to imagine scenes and movement which the bare and static Elizabethan stage could not provide . <P> Olivier 's Henry V. Olivier 's Henry V frees Shakespeare from such Elizabethan limitations . The film runs two hours and 14 minutes . Seldom during that time does it fudge or fall short of the best that its author gave it . Almost continually , it invests the art of Shakespeare - and the art of cinema as well - with a new spaciousness , a new mobility , a new radiance . <P> Sometimes , by courageous ( but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improves on the original . <P> Yet its brilliance is graceful , never self-assertive . It simply subserves , extends , illuminates and liberates Shakespeare 's poem .
