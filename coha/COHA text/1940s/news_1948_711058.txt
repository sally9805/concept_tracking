txt JERUSALEM , Feb. 10 ? Arabs attacked and occupied today a Marge part of the Montefiore I 1 ( Yemin Moshe ) Jewish quarter in ' the heart of Jerusalem in the ' Icourse of a five-hour battle before 1British troops forced them to I retire . The attack , the first organized one by Arabs in Jerusalem on a Marge scale , ended at 4 P. M. only ' after three companies of British troops had deployed in the approaches to the area . It was preceded by apparently aimless firing , which cleared the surrounding streets . The British troops left parties strategically posted in Montefiore against any new attack . To prevent the reinforcement of Arabs who had captured a large building in Montefiore from which they were attacking Jews , the British had occupied Bishop Gobat 's School , which covers the approach from the Jaffa Gate . Total casualties in Montefiore reported by the authorities were one Jew , seven Arabs and one British soldier killed , five Jews , thirteen Arabs and one British soldier seriously wounded and one Jew and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jews killed seven Arabs . Casualties in the Montefiore fighting were not higher because neither the British nor the Arabs wished a direct clash . When the Arabs saw that the British meant business they withdrew . Before then , however , the British had to bring into action two-inch mortars and Breda quick-firing 16-mm cannon . The section of Montefiore that was occupied lies just behind the // King David Hotel and near the French consulate , which was damaged by many shots , during the fighting . The heaviest firing yet heard here in the current fighting went on all morning , and at 2:30 P. M. a company of the Highland Ligilt Infantry took action positions in the waste ground beside the Pub-1 Inc Information Office south of British headquarters in the King ' David Hotel . Bren ? guns were set up and riflemen deployed behind rocks and trees . A few shots from a machine gun lin the direction of the Arab at- ' , tackers produced an immediate lull . Within a few minutes , however , the Arabs were firing again . Meanwhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past the United States consulate in the Jaffa Gate area . This unit was pinned down for a time by heavy fire . The troop movements and dispositions indicated that the British were concerned lest the Arabs try to break through into the British security zone toward the headquarters of the Jewish Agency for Palestine , less than a half-mile up King George Avenue . At 3:30 P. M. British troops in armored carriers moved into Montefiore to help cover Jewish ambulances , which were being heavily fired on as they attempted to remove the wounded . Heavy fire there and from a platoon in machine gun carriers near Abu Tor , an Arab village a half-mile away , kept the attackers ' heads down and the ambulances got out . I Despite the machine-gun fire , the troops that went down Mamilla Road managed to flank the Arabs in Montefiore and to force a withdrawal . Two-inch mortar shells fired by the British from near the King David Hotel hastened the withdrawal . According to a reliable Arab source , the Arabs intended to plant heavy charges and destroy as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring up the explosives . This source said they had high explosive and incendiary bombs ready and would try again to plant them . An Arab eyewitness said he was passing the Jaffa gate at 11 A. M. when guards ordered him to turn back . He was unable to leave the area for four hours . Just after 11 , he said , a great crowd of armed Arabs , wearing bandoliers of cartridges and with grenades slung on belts , surged out of the gate toward Montefiore , 300 yards away , shouting battle cries . He estimated the force at 1,000 . Five hundred is probably a more accurate estimate . South of Haifa , Jews inflicted Arab casualties in an attack on a party returning from Petah Tiqva . A party of Jews blocked the road with a truck and marched all the Arabs into an orange grove near Ras el-Ein . Shooting was heard , and the dead and wounded Arabs were found by searchers . The Jewish newspaper Davar said that the Army had discovered a secret pipeline that was tapping the Army gasoline line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Arab village of Balad esh-Sheikh near by , according to the article , which said 6,000 gallons of gasoline was missed in the last six months . Arabs escaped with six tons of Government-owned flour when six armed men captured a truck from an Arab driver .
