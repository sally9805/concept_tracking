 | The You-Don't-Want-a-Divorce Court Condensed from The New Republic Frank 7. taylor In Los ANGELES County , where 12,382 spouses last year asked for divorce , there is a new court , the Children 's Court of Conciliation , created to save , if humanly possible , the homes of the 17,500 children involved in these actions . Known as " the peace department " and the " you-don't-want-a-divorce " court , it is the brainchild of Judge Ben Lindsey , famous as the originator of Denver 's juvenile court , who has served on the Los Angeles bench since 1935 ? Let us follow the case of " Jane Doe , plaintiff , versus John Doe , respondent . " ( No other names are available because the only record is a memorandum made by the Judge for his own reference , and there were no spectators , reporters or stenographers . ) After a spat with his wife , John Doe had bolted from their home . Presently Jane Doe appeared in the domestic relations court , petitioning for a divorce . Without even reading the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minor children ? " " Yes . Jimmy , six , and Sally , four . " " Then I 'll have to send you to the Children 's Court of Conciliation . " It was unlike any court Jane Doe had ever seen . In the anteroom , resembling a doctor 's office , the receptionist made out a new complaint , which read , " The People of the State of California , for the best interests and protection of Jimmy Doe and Sally Doe , minor children , and concerning Jane Doe and John Doe . " Two days later , Jane and John Doe and their attorneys were in an unpretentious office , seated across a table from kindly , bespectacled , 7o-year-old Judge Lindsey . First , the judge explained : " This court is concerned with the right of your children to you , rather than your rights to your children . They have certain rights to live happily under one roof with you . Court records show that your son and your daughter have six times as many chances of becoming charges of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now let 's see if the difficulties between you justify that risk . " For nearly an hour the judge  | listened to both stories and asked probing questions . At last he said , almost as if to himself , " If John would give up gambling and stay home at night , and if Jane would quit nagging and run the house more economically , this family would live happily together . " Then , directly , to John and Jane , " Think it over , and meet here a week from today . " To the lawyers he added : " See what you boys can do to save this family . " The following week the Doe family was reunited . Another case was that of Richard Roe , a struggling young movie actor , Ruth Roe , daughter of a well-to-do family , and Betty Roe , their infant daughter . The Judge talked first with the young husband , who denied that he had been unfaithful , as charged by his wife 's attorney . Then he called in Ruth Roe . Soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spouse of infidelity , said that she did n't want a divorce , but that her mother , who had social ambitions , had insisted . " A typical case of motherin-law trouble , " said Judge Lindsey . He made the mother-in-law a respondent in the petition of " The People of California for the best interests and protection of Betty Roe , minor , and concerning Ruth and Richard Roe . " That restrains the mother-in-law , while the young couple work out their own destinies . This clinic technique evolved out of Judge Lindsey 's long experience in Denver , as Colorado 's first juvenile judge , where he served con- tinuously from 1900 to 1927 . Then a Ku Klux Klan crusade defeated him - at the polls and brought his disbarment . Later the Colorado ' Supreme Court reinstated him before the state bar , but the battle had broken his health and he retired to southern California . His vigor restored , Lindsey was elected in November 1934 to the Los Angeles County Superior Court by the largest majority ever given a judicial candidate up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divorce cases , and the effect upon the children , Lindsey approached Judge Fletcher Bowron , now clean-up mayor of Los Angeles but then the presiding judge of the Superior Court , and obtained permission to try such cases informally in his chambers .  | tioning the space into a reception room and four small private offices . Lindsey was soon using the four offices to conduct as many cases simultaneously . With the money normally spent on bailiff and clerk , he employed a capable woman lawyer , Mrs. Rosalind Bates , for preliminary questioning and investigating . Henrietta Brevoort Lindsey , his wife , served as another assistant , without pay . Keen for short cuts , Judge Lindsey used his telephone as the summons server to get witnesses . Nobody was sworn to tell the truth . " I can tell whether people are telling the truth or not , " he explained . While George Jones and his wife and their attorneys ? to take a typical day ? talk over the court 's conciliation proposal in one room , Judge Lindsey slips into another to listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her because loan sharks from whom she borrowed money without his permission garnisheed his wages . Reaching for a phone , the Judge talks to the husband , then telephones the money lenders to come to court . While they are coming , he drops into a third room to listen to an irate couple who still want to take their divorce through the publicity of the domestic relations court . " Well , it will take three full days , with all the witnesses you want to call , to try this case in the domestic relations court , " says the Judge . " It will cost the state $25o a day , and it will cost you more than that . When you get through , the settlement may not be any better than we can work out here in an hour . Your children will brood all their lives over the things you say about each other . For their sake , let 's try to work out an amicable settlement here . " Under the law , the Children 's Court of Conciliation has 30 days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separation before estranged parents can bring formal charges against each other in the domestic relations court . This 3o-day truce is the key to averting divorces , says Judge Lindsey . " Couples who have a real affection for each other quarrel violently and one or the other starts action , " he explains . " After that , neither will back down . The 30-day delay lets them cool off . " Lindsey has a genius for making couples feel at ease in his presence . They can smoke , chew gum , " let down their hair , " as he puts it . He frequently calls in a physician , psychologist , endocrinologist , a pastor or a priest , to help bring around a recalcitrant spouse . He finds jobs for husbands , or wives , or both , to keep families off the rocks of poverty . He often holds court during the lunch hour to save a husband the loss of work time . In his first nine months , though sitting only half time on account of other duties , Judge Lindsey handled The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settled cases that normally would have required 15o days , three fourths of them without trial . In one third he effected reconciliations , which the routine courts seldom attempted . Fired by this experience , Lindsey drew up and pushed through the 1939 legislature a bill authorizing County Courts of Conciliation . He was assigned the task of setting up the new court in Los Angeles and opened it last September . Lindsey 's first move was to tear out all formal paraphernalia ? bench , witness seat , jury box , spectators ' gallery , and counsel 's table , parti-  | slightly over I000 cases . In 400 he effected reconciliation and the parents have resumed normal life in homes affecting 900 children . Another 400 couples agreed to settle their differences in private and were granted an interlocutory decree , with one year for work on reconciliation before the decree becomes final . Two hundred insisted on fighting it out in public court . Curiously , it was the wife who refused conciliation in four out of five of this last group . These figures do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to husbands , have come in to talk over marital problems with the judge , as have a good many husbands , some of whom visit him at home in the evening . I had heard that lawyers were bitterly opposed to the Court of Conciliation , partly because cases were settled too quickly to justify large fees ; indeed , when counsel was needed , the fudge usually fixed the fee at around $5o for each attorney , instead of the customary $500 . Much to my surprise , I found enthusiasm among attorneys . " I 'd hate to go back to the old trim method , " exclaimed one . Anoth said , " This court saves days of time for us as well as our clients ; and the settlements are better . " The taxpayers benefit , too . Mayor Bowron estimates that one Children 's Court of Conciliation can handle as many domestic relations cases as four formal trial courts , and save at least $100,000 a year " That 's nothing at all , " he added " compared to the saving in terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
