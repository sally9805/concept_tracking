Western Front : II Notes from a Soldier 's Diary THE BATH IN HOLLAND . ? After four months of combat I had my first tub bath and I shall never forget it . We entered a little Dutch town and saw a sign over the entrance to a large factory , " American Army men who desire showers are welcome . " Our first reconnaissance party for the shower detail approached the plant cautiously , fearful that the whole thing might be a big booby trap , but investigation proved that the facts were even better than the sign promised . There were showers , but there were also jumbo-sized bathtubs with steaming hot water , each tub in a semi-private compartment with a locker , a radiator , white tiled walls and a heated cork floor in approximately the style of any Downtown Athletic Club . All this was ours , it turned out , because the foreman of the plant was the local leader of the resistance movement . He thought it was something he could do for the Americans ; I 'm sure he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the faucets to full heat . We soaked , splashed and sang , shouting to each other over the partitions , thoroughly confusing the Dutch attendant who must have thought the Americans , although possibly effective fighters , slightly nuts . I am sure his impression was indelibly confirmed when the man in the compartment next to mine , who had finished his bath and was two-thirds dressed , said , " Oh , the hell with it ! " and proceeded to run another tub and start all over . No Disasters. ? Keeping the telephone lines intact and the radios working is not the hardest part of Communications . The greatest difficulty is saying the right thing . Two or three days after the landing the Division Commander ordered that there would be no reports of disasters or extraordinary successes . An illustrative example accompanied the edict ; in case the enemy should throw some of its weight against us , the news would be transmitted not as a " counter-attack , " but as " enemy enthusiasm . " By the same token , if one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and advance four or five miles , the achievement would be termed something like " good progress . " Nothing extreme , no matter what . The idea behind this order was to improve transmission of information within the unit , not , as it may sound , to censor the news reports to higher headquarters or to the press . The assumption was that disasters and triumphs practically never occur , and when they do it does n't help to use rich adjectives in reporting things . And further , that there is a natural inclination to color up bad news . A scout on a forward observation post sees one self-propelled 88-millimeter gun , he thinks . By the time his report gets all the way up to the G-2 in Division Headquarters ? unless there is an order to prevent it ? the gun is likely to have become 200 Tiger tanks headed our way . It is one thing to issue an order ; seeing that it is obeyed is something else . In this case the order had to compete against human nature plus the high tension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to believe , too , that the order was meant literally . " Suppose , " went the natural reaction , " the battalion really is surrounded by tanks ? What do we say then ? " The answer was , of course , that there was no rule against reporting tanks ( not to be confused with self-propelled guns ) in such and such number ( not to be given in round figures , but exactly ) observed at blank coordinates moving in the direction X to Y at ZZZZ hours . The rule only forbade words like " surrounded , " " cut off , " " hundreds of huge tanks " and " overrun . " Furthermore , by some odd good fortune none of the battalions ever was cut off by tanks , not even little ones . In spite of the order , groundless reports of grave misfortune continued to filter back to Division . The corrective action was simple and effective . The Commanding General upon receiving the rumor would order it traced back to the origin . " Have the man who saw the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And soon , after an epic amount of calling and checking , someone would have to report in person to the General that nobody had exactly seen the tanks , but there had been considerable rumbling off in the distance . Reporting in person to the Commanding General is embarrassing . In short order , anyone who ever had occasion to speak over a field telephone or fill out a message blank was convinced that it did n't pay to make any statements that he would n't swear to and sign . Night Raid. ? Do n't let anyone tell you that soldiers do n't get frightened . They do . It took me several weeks to find out what fear is like . The initial-landing had scared me ( although I spent all of D-day sitting a few hundred yards offshore waiting my turn to disembark ) , but that had been an intellectual fright composed of imagining what might presently happen . The sight of the wreckage on the beach jolted me into a kind of fear . So did the sound of DECEMBER 25 , 1 9 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and every time thereafter ) . I had n't been ashore long before a sniper took a wild potshot at me , and that markedly increased my pulse rate . But my reactions to these various stimuli , I learned , were of a mild variety compared to the terror of the first serious bombing of the Command Post area . It took place about midnight , a lovely June night with a half-moon that lit the flat Normandy orchards too brightly . I was on duty as artillery liaison officer in the Division war tent ; not much going on , and the various officers there were talking over the day 's activity . Inside the war tent it was bright , the evening had been quiet and the war seemed remote and unlikely . Higher headquarters had warned that there might be some enemy air activity , but the few planes that had been overhead on previous nights had concentrated their efforts against the beaches : nobody paid much attention to the alert . We heard one or two planes high above us and the war-tent group agreed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their engines . A few seconds later , quite a distance to the east of us , a stick of anti-personnel bombs exploded . The sentry on duty guarding the entrance to the war tent came in and reported that there were flares in the sky , quite far away to the east . The sentry went back to his post and we , inside the tent , went on about our business . Five or ten minutes later a second stick of bombs fell , close enough to whine as they dropped . We all grabbed our helmets and put them on . There was no question but that they had hit nearby . The tent shook from the blast , rocking the lights strung from the ridgepole . The senior officer said he thought we ought to clear the tent and get into the slit trenches outside . The exit to a CP tent is hard to manage . You have to lift a flap , make a sharp left turn and stumble along a canvas passageway for five or six paces . After the brightness inside the tent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to file out . The third string of bombs fell , high explosive : a long whine and then earthquaking thuds , five or six in a fast series , about five hundred yards away . The first man out of the tent said , in surprise , " God damn it ! These flares are right overhead ! " I was fourth or fifth in line , and while I waited to get out I got scared . The first three strings had frightened me , but not until the few seconds of delay at the exit did my throat and chest tighten up . Finally my turn came . Halfway out through the exit I could see light from the flares in the sky . That upset me ; we had been trained to freeze in our tracks whenever the enemy drops a flare . It seemed to me that the bombers would see me in my ten-yard dash to the slit trench and yet there was no point in standing by the 86/ exit . The man behind me was pushing to get out , so I ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a huge spotlight and sure that the bombers were watching me , personally . The trench did n't look deep enough . 1 hesitated an instant and thought , " Maybe there is a deeper one farther along . " One of the planes roared by and at the same time there was a long burst of machine-gun fire . I jumped into the slit trench and hit the ground . Another string of bombs started to whine down . The noise they make is like the whistle of an artillery shell but sharper and at least half again as long . It starts high in pitch and slides down the scale , and halfway down you think it has gone far enough , that it will surely go off . But instead it continues to whistle , the sound originating from nowhere in particular but seeming to point right at you . And the longer it whines , the closer it seems to get , until you are sure that when it does explode it will be at the back of your head . I lay face down in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft ground , as close to the earth as I could get , and held my breath . ( That is not the way to lie . It is better to lie on your side , chinstrap unfastened , for protection against blast effect . ) The long whine ended . There was a pause . Then two or three hundred yards away to my right the cluster of bombs exploded , a heavy rumble of detonation . The sound seemed to blanket an area . I recall thinking that it must have destroyed everything in the field where the bombs landed . When the bombs went off and I realized that I had n't been hit , I found I could n't draw a full breath . My chest felt contracted and tight . I was cold and vaguely dissatisfied with my slit-trench . I wished that I had dug it myself , thinking irrationally that somehow I would be protected in a trench of my own digging . Then , since there seemed to be a slight lull in the bombardment , I rolled over and lifted my head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better hole . The flares were still burning , a long even row of them in the sky , and they seemed to be fixed rather than parachuting down . They were well off to my right . That was a relief , because I had thought before that they were directly above me . Another bomber roared overhead , quite low , and I saw the first of a string of flares splash into flame ; it was dead ahead of me and it looked close enough to touch . I flopped back on the bottom of the trench and began to shake . The whine started again and I thought , " They are going to get me this time , they are systematically bombing the CP in a pattern of strips and this time I am right in the middle of the strip . " I tried to sink my head into my shoulders , turtle fashion , and I closed my eyes . The whine crept down the scale and I shook , not like shivering from cold but slower and bigger . Some of my weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the source of the shaking was nowhere and all over ; I remember feeling my knees bumping the ground . I had plenty of time to think , but nothing entered my mind except the idea that this was the one with my number on it . Then the bombs went off , the same all-embracing , blanketing explosion , and 1 knew that I had n't been hit . Nly shaking , however , went on . The noise of the airplane motors grew fainter and I lifted myself off the ground , still shaking . The flares had dimmed . In the half-darkness I saw a figure run across the field and I remembered for the first time since I had hit the slit trench that I was not entirely alone , that I was in fact surrounded by slit trenches filled with my war-tent associates . I wanted to talk to them . For a moment or two I sat in the slit-trench trying to decide whether the raid was over , having a hard time making up my mind , unable to bring into proper focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the planes v ere now almost out of earshot . I do n't remember that I ever made up my mind , but I did want to talk to somebody , so finally I got out of the trench and ran a few yards to a sort of dugout covered with boards and dirt . I was still shivering , but I could breathe again and I had become self-conscious to the extent of realizing that I was badly scared . Two friends of mine were inside with a stray pup they had picked up . I crawled in with them and laughed at the dog , which was shivering too , and we sat in the dark for fifteen minutes , exchanging accounts of the raid , each of us claiming that he had been most frightened , talking the terror out of our systems . Nothing Automatic About It . ? The comment , " Our boys are just automatically wonderful , " ought to be discarded . Presumably it is intended as high praise ; actually it is false , and an unintentional insult to all those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winning armies . I do n't know about the native aptitude of Americans for fighting . I would n't be able to compare Americans with Germans , Russians or Japanese . 1 do know that some of " our boys " turn out to he cowards . Some are disloyal . Some arc thieves . Some are not mechanically inventive in the slightest and have a hard time keeping issued equipment in working order , let alone building an ice-cream freezer out of the wreckage of a Mark IV tank . It 's hard , furthermore , for a soldier to look presentable , much less " wonderful , " when he is on the losing side . I wonder whether the clich ? would have become popular if we had not recently had a series of resounding victories . So instead of " automatically , " I 'd use " deliberately " ; and in place of " our boys " put " our armies . " The real object for astonished surprise is that in are:el:irk:ably short time we have turned out armies good enough to win , armies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers , furnished with superior equipment and supported be an air force of overwhelming power . And this is far inure remarkable , if less romantic , than the idea that Amer : in Lies hive a trace of Paul Eunyan 's blood in their veins. 1V ; cylit Watch. ? After our long and rapid displacement from Normandy to Iiiiiftativ , it took about a week for our noel service , which had been pleasingly regular , to catch up with us . Finally , one afternoon , a rumor filtered down to our unit that the APO in the rear was stuffed with mail sacks ; that there was bound to be a delivery just as soon as the letters could be sorted . Knowles , the mail orderly , left I ieadquarters early in the afternoon , but he did n't get back by suppertime as usual . " He 's probably sending back for an extra six-by-six , " said Wood , an optimist . " He 's probably got so many packages they wo n't fit on that old weapons carrier . " But Knowles had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and therefore bedtime for almost everyone not on night duty . I crawled into my combination pup tent and slit trench and squirmed about trying to find the least uncomfortable sleeping position . Pfc . White interrupted me . " Sir , " he said , " in case the mail comes in , do you want me to wake you up ? " I asked him if he were n't going to turn in. " 1 think I 'll wait a while for Knowles . Me and Batney and a couple of the fellows arc going to Wait . Knowles may be back any minute . " I thought it over . " If I do get a letter , " I said , " put it in my helmet . But do n't wake me up . And do n't you stay up too late . " " No , sir . " At daybreak the next morning I found a letter in my helmet and shortly thereafter I found White just finishing putting on his leggings . " Good morning , sir , " said White . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I got three , two from my wife and one from my mother . " " Damn good , " I said . " What time did Knowles get back ? " " Four-thirty , " said White . " But I did n't mind waiting . There was a bunch of us . We got to shooting the bull . Knowles was back before we knew it . " Somewhere in Germany
