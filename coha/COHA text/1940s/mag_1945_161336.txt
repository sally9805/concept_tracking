The white man had reoccupied Java , richest and most densely populated of the East Indies , with such weak forces that he had been forced to call on armed Japs for police help . Now Dutchmen , Eurasians and Japs were being killed in skirmishes all over the island . Hardly any of it except Batavia , where the natives called a work stoppage , and Bandung , was under white control . The native leader , Soekarno , admitted that he got his arms from the Japs , with whom he collaborated during the war , but pointed to his prewar anti-Jap utterances as proof of good faith . A Mohammedan , he called on the Mohammedan majority in Java for a holy war against " Dutch infidels . " <P> The native faction which calls itself the Indonesian Republic declared war on the Dutch , Eurasians and Amboinese ( warlike Amboina Islanders , many of whom have joined the Netherlands Army ) . Weapons ( according to Indonesian People 's Army headquarters ) : " All kinds of firearms , also poison , poisoned darts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . wild animals , as for instance snakes . " <P> The Dutch stood by their 1942 pledge of self-government for the Indies in a new Netherlands Commonwealth , but they boggled at dealing with Soekarno , began shipping troops from Holland to the island battlefield . British troops , holding the imperial fort until sufficient Dutch forces arrived , were caught in the middle . They were criticized by the natives for helping the Dutch , by the Dutch for haggling over the conditions of help . At week 's end the Allied commander in Java , British Major General D. C. Hawthorn , proclaimed that looting , sabotage , possessing or refusing to surrender arms by natives would be punished by death .
