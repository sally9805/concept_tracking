RAISING A RIOT ( 244 pp. ) - Alfred Toombs-Crowell ( $3 ) . <P> <P> " You men ! You think you 're so smart . I 'd just like to see you try to take care of a house and kids . " <P> That anguished cry of womankind has echoed down the ages of this man 's world , and the wise guys of every age have found that it pays to sympathize . Author Toombs has sympathized so shrewdly in Raising a Riot that he is likely to be paid plenty in royalties . <P> Toombs is an ex-newsman whose wife took ill and left him to care for their three children . If there is a word of truth in Raising a Riot , Toombs ran about like a chicken with its head off for 18 months-a spectacle that may weary some readers after 18 pages-and finished every day feeling like " an egg dropped on concrete . " <P> After reducing himself to an object as piteous and work-ridden as an aged charwoman 's knee , Toombs wails an old refrain : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a housekeeper can make . You have the awful feeling that you are in debt to the day . . . Housekeeping is certainly the hardest job I . . . ever tackled . " <P> Crowell is the same publisher who brought out Cheaper by the Dozen ( TIME , , June 13 ) , another tale of life with father , which was a surprise bestseller last spring . With full publicity behind it , Riot could easily sell almost as well . Yet the book has little of Dozen 's natural air of comedy in it ; it relies on carefully measured doses of laughing gas , slightly under pressure .
