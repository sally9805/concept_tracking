 | He turned . It was the last turn . There was the house before us . It was huge against the sky . " Thank goodness . " I relaxed . " I was afraid we would n't make it . It looks all dark . You do n't suppose we could have got the wrong evening ? " " No . You ca n't see the lights from this side . " He lit a cigarette . " Let me finish this story about the house before we go in . " " O.K. , but give me a cigarette . Mine are in my week-end case . " " Oh , sorry . " He lit it for me . " Where was I ? Oh yes , how he was doing all kinds of silly things for love of the gal . She liked rafters , so the living room is burdened with heavy dark beams across the ceiling . She was supposed to have been quite a beauty . " He hesitated . " Personally , I do n't think I 'd have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pale and blond and willowy . " Thoughtfully he said , " I like a woman that 's got something to her . " What was it Peter had said ? " Your sweet defenseless body ... " " Yes , I know what you like . Sort of a buxom barmaid type , like that big Swede . " " Stella ! Say , she was all right . I wonder where she is now ? Have n't seen her for ages . " " Go on with your story . " There was a light-colored cat sitting on the low stone wall that ran around the house . Jim had turned off the car lights , but I could see the cat sitting there watching us . Once in a while his tail would twirl , and then hang straight again , down over the stone . " Well , one Sunday morning they came to look over the house . This big bruiser and his willowy frigid blonde . " He stopped . " I guess it was awful when they were found . " I felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the window . " The contractor had known they were coming and fortunately  | had decided to come to talk to them . When he saw the man 's car he got out of his own and hallooed . But nobody answered . He thought they might have gone for a walk . He started into the house and he heard this noise . He could n't tell at first what it was , but he knew it was coming from the first floor . He started to the ladder . None of the stairways was finished . He was running , and he could tell now that the noise was a man 's voice , but he could n't tell what it was doing . It did n't sound like talking or laughing or crying . When he got to the top of the ladder he saw them . This big fellow was sitting at the foot of the ladder going to the second floor , and he was holding her in his arms . Her head was hanging back , and her hair had fallen down . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pigeon , my poor little pigeon . ' " Suddenly Jim was laughing . I thought for a minute it was going to be a joke  --  a joke that would stop the cold chills running up and down my back . " The story always gets me up to that point . Want another cigarette , kid ? " I took one . The cat was still watching us . " But somehow his calling her his little pigeon always strikes me as funny . Little pigeon ! The guy must have been nuts . Anyway , the contractor rushes over , and the guy does n't even register . He just keeps on moaning and holding her to him . The contractor starts yelling , What 's the matter , man ? What happened ? ' " Jim took a long drag on his cigarette . " She 's dead , of course . But the contractor ca n't budge him , or get her away from him , so he tears out , locates a telephone , and the state police come over . He 's such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handle him , and they 've brought a doctor , so he gives him a hypo or something . Anyway , they put him under and get the girl out of his arms . Her neck 's broken . Then they find the heel off her slipper . She had on those high spike heels . " Jim grunted , " Women who wear spike heels in the dunes . And they deduce that she 's climbing the ladder and her heel catches and breaks and she goes plummeting down and breaks her  | fragile neck . So the guy 's off his base for quite some time . When he gets his mind back he wo n't even come out to the house . And Bernard buys it from a broker for practically nothing , because , hell , nobody wants a house that size . " The cat stood up , walked along the wall , his back arched . The wind must be rising  --  you could hear the sound of the lake now . A heel caught in the ladder . She was probably proud of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoes . He may have been standing on the floor above her , coaxing her on . He wanted her to see the view from the room that was to be their bedroom . And she was afraid of the ladder , she did n't want to climb , but she was trying , and her face was smiling up at him . She must have tried to pull her heel loose . She would scream as she fell , and his last memory of her face would be with it twisted in fear  --  and him helpless above her . The last time I saw Peter he was looking at me with longing . I thought it was longing . He was saying , " I 'll call you , darling , or write you . " He had n't done either . Before I 'd realized , I 'd written him two letters . I was sorry , now , about those letters . They 'd never been answered . Jim 's voice started again . " Of course she haunts the house . " " What ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jim , I 'll have no truck with a haunted house . " " Oh , you wo n't know anything about it . And do n't , for heaven 's sake , mention it in front of the Parrys or any of the guests . They 're sensitive about it . It was a joke , and they told the story with gusto , until two females developed hysterics in the middle of the night . Mother Parry has put her foot down and no one is allowed to mention it . " " But how does she haunt ? Do people see her , or what ? " " Well , the story is  --  and I think myself that Bernard cooked it up originally as a game , but told it to the wrong people , and they thought they heard it  --  the story is that the only people who hear it arc those who have been disappointed in love . "  | " Oh , my God ! " " Yeah , silly , is n't it ? " I was glad he 'd misunderstood me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one girl who heard it . You could n't get her out here now for love nor money , and she swore that she thought someone was running along the hall upstairs . She was so sure that for a minute she tried to figure out who 'd be running around in the middle of the night in high heels . Then there 's silence  --  I suppose that 's for when she 's climbing  --  then there 's a thump . Very realistic . One girl who heard it added the touch of a scream . A faint scream . " He turned . " Well , shall we go in ? Now that you 've heard the romantic history . " The cat jumped down off the wall , started walking toward the car . Jim opened the door . " Hi-ya , Mister Blister . Come here . " He jumped onto Jim 's lap . " Beauty , is n't he ? " " Yeah . Persian ? What did you call him ? " " Silly name . They started calling him Mister , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God knows why . " " He 's been sitting up there watching us . " " Probably thought we were being guilty of misconduct . " He stroked the cat 's neck . " Did you now , Mister Blister ? " " Silly . " " No foolin ' . He 's the worst chaperon you ever saw . Bernard says it started with the cat 's being jealous of him . If he puts his arm around Delia or kisses her the cat 'll tear over and dig into his legs with his claws . He started on Bernard and now no man is safe . Make a pass or two at a gal and if the cat 's around he raises cain . Remember that , Jennie , if you 're tempted to any romantic interludes this week end . Be sure Mister Blister 's out chasing rabbits before you go into any clinches . " " Do n't be ridiculous . " I got out of the car . But the crazy picture of a cat being a chaperon put the other picture out of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go into the house .  | Jim honked the horn and a minute or two later light streamed out of the garage doors to the right of the house . And when I heard Bernard 's loud voice I had to laugh at the thought of the ghost of a fragile girl haunting any house where he lived . " Thought you guys were never going to get here . How 're you , Jennie ? That blonde you liked could n't come this week end , Jim . Here , let me take those bags . " Delia was standing in the door . She put her arm around me and led me through the kitchen into the big living room . I guess I had expected cement and brick walls and bareness , but I was shocked by my first look at the room . Big soft couches and chairs . Low bookcases running around two sides . Later I noticed the bowls of asters and zinnias and fruit ; I saw the two modern paintings that were at first only vivid splotches of color . A tiny gray-haired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She held mine firmly , looked up at me . " So this is Jennie . I 'm so glad you could come , my dear . " When I answered her my own voice sounded high and thin in comparison to hers . Delia started leading me around the room . The first girl I met was young . She did n't look to be more than eighteen or nineteen . She was sprawled ungracefully on the couch . Her long bob was braided back from her face . No make-up  --  not even lipstick . She smiled broadly . " Hi , " she said . " Peg , " Delia explained , " is in Bernard 's office . We like having her around ; she keeps us all young . " You could always tell when Delia liked someone . There was a warmth in her eyes , in her voice . That warmth left when she turned me to the next person . She was still smiling , still sounding friendly , but there was a shade of difference . " This is  --  do I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spendler . " Lucious red hair  --  a lovely henna shade that made you wonder whether or not it was true  --  wound in thick braids around her head . She was good-looking . Long and thin , white skin ,  | and eyes exactly the color of her hair . So it must be authentic . She said , " How do you do , " and smiled , and I was sorry I had n't had my hair done , sorry I 'd thought , Well , after all , a week end at the dunes , I 'll get it full of sand anyway . Delia went on , " Margot writes . She 's pretty good , too . " " Thank you . I consider that enthusiastic praise from you , Delia . " Delia shugged her shoulders . " You know I do n't pretend to anything higher than the Saturday Evening Post . " The man next to Margot was standing . He looked short . I could n't tell whether or not it was because he was slouching . " George Adams , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes enough money to live on selling something which does n't take up much of his time . You 'll notice the glass of beer and ale in his hand . If you forget his face you can always tell him by that . " I liked George . There was a lazy friendliness in his face that pleased me . " And this is Spike Donneley . " Spike shook hands with me . He had heavy eyebrows and a deep voice . " I 'm a bookkeeper , " he said . " I do n't think even Delia can add another glamorous fact . Do you do ' anything ? I mean  --  " I shook my head . " I know what you mean , and I do n't . I work in an office and play bridge and read best sellers . " He looked hopeful . " You do n't even collect anything ? " He grinned at Delia . " There 's three of us , then . We can talk about the weather and our bosses and bridge hands and the mystery that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut in . " Spike , you have the most unpleasant habit of making the rest of us sound like a bunch of pseudo bohemians . As a matter of fact we always talk about bosses and the weather and a serial in some magazine or other . " Spike was glum . " Except when we 're playing games . " I 'd heard about Bernard 's fondness for games . But we did n't  | play any that evening . We sat around talking . Spike kept wishing we could have a bridge game . The only ones who played were Delia and he and George and I. And George did n't seem much interested . About ten-thirty young Peg said she was going to bed . Jim and Mother Parry were playing chess , and Bernard was wandering around , filling glasses and passing potato chips and pretzels . Very restive . Spike said , " Come on , George , play with us , just for a little while . " George finally said he would . At that Margot said she guessed she 'd go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How about playing in the big room upstairs ? I 've a fire already laid  --  all I have to do is set a match to it . " Margot clapped her hands . " Oh , good . You and I , Bernard , can sit in front of it while they 're playing . " It sounded crazy to me . The upstairs was n't wired for electricity . We 'd have to play by lamplight , but they all thought it was a fine idea . There was much scrambling around . Bernard went up ahead to light the way . Even flanked by Delia and Spike , the darkness was ominous to me . And when I stepped into the room I could hardly keep from grabbing someone  --  anyone . It was so large you could n't see into the corners . And the fireplace looked as though it was falling into the room . The big plate-glass window reflected the lights of the two lamps and our figures moving around . We got the card table set up and Bernard lit the fire . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room better . There were two cots . Spike and George were sleeping here . Various miscellaneous pieces of furniture were stacked around . Bernard moved a small couch in front of the fire . He finally got it placed just right and sat down . We started playing . They were all good , and I forgot the house and how I felt about the darkness in having to concentrate on what I was doing . We could hear now and then  | Peg 's and Margot 's voices shouting back and forth outside . Peg 's room was right next to the big one , and Margot was up on the floor above . Alone . I would n't have slept up there , but they said she liked it . Marvelous view , and she was a light sleeper , and being up there , away from everyone , there was n't anything to disturb her . Spike said , " She says she 's a light sleeper , but the real truth is that she 's lazy and likes to sleep late , and does n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glad I was sleeping downstairs in the room with Mother Parry . The bridge game was going fine . Spike and I made a small slam in clubs , and Delia and George countered with a game , doubled , in spades . We each had a rubber and were both vulnerable in the third ? and I was beginning to get them settled in my mind . Spike was methodical and logical . You could always depend on him . He never took a flurry , played according to rules . George was brilliant . Where Spike would indicate to me , give me forcing bids , shove up steadily but slowly , George would jump the bid suddenly , shutting out everyone , and then  --  make it . Delia was quick , never hesitating in playing or bidding . She did n't take the chances George took , but she could follow him . She 'd be right there pitching when he needed her . It was a good battle . Close . You 'd have thought we were playing for a cent a point , the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying , " It 's more than a bridge game . It 's a test . Jennie and I represent plodding , careful players . You two , erratic , brilliant ones . " George asked , " What do you mean , erratic ? Delia and I are playing just as good a game as you two . " Spike snorted , " You 're pulling one boner after another . Listen , on that last hand , you never should have given her a jump-shift response . Why , man , you had the count for only a one raise in her suit  --  a damn weak response . "  | " We made it , did n't we ? " " Fool 's luck . " He cut the cards . " That 's what I say  --  this is a contest between rules  --  and fool 's luck . " George had just started to deal the hand when she walked into the room . He looked up , and when I turned I could see why he 'd lost the sequence of the deal . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one hand touching the side of the door . Her hair was hanging over her shoulders , and her face without make-up was even lovelier than with it . It was quite effective . George said , " If I could paint her like that ! But how could you ever get the effect of the moving firelight . " Bernard was standing up . " I thought you 'd deserted me . I thought you 'd gone to bed . Me  --  sitting here listening to one spade , ' two clubs , " double , ' redouble , ' made it , ' down one . ' " Spike urged , " O.K. , O.K. , deal ' em , George , deal ' em . " She walked over to the bridge table . Some kind of scent as she leaned down . " Are you winning , George ? " " At the moment . " How stiff his words were . " Go on , Margot , go on over and play with Bernard . This is a serious game . Do n't interrupt us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me . " But we might just as well have stopped playing . Even I could n't concentrate . She spurned the couch Bernard had placed in front of the fire , found a low stool over in the corner , moved it beside the fireplace , and sat down . We heard Bernard say fondly , " Little Alice-Sit-by-the-Fire . " Spike mimicked , " Little Goody Two-shoes . Delia , your husband is by way of being fatuous . " She sorted her cards . " I 'm afraid you 're right . " We made a pretense of playing , but George could n't keep from looking at her . Spike and Delia seemed to be ignoring the two by the fire , but I was as bad as George . I listened .  | Bernard said , " Tell me a story , Margot . " And I got so interested I finally threw down my hand and said , " I want to go over and hear it too . " George agreed quickly , " Yes , let 's . " Delia got up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things to get ready for breakfast . " Spike started adding up the bridge scores . I sat down on the couch beside Bernard , and George crouched on the floor across from Margot . She did n't pay any attention to us apparently . She kept on with the story . A long time after that night I read some of Margot 's things , and always as I read her words I could hear her voice . There 's no way to describe it . Maybe it was the room and the firelight and her long straight copper hair moving in that light , and her hands lying still in her lap . Part of it , too , might have been Jim downstairs at the piano . They told me the next day that he always played for Mother Parry . As Spike said , " If there 's no girl for Jim to bother he plays chess with Mother Parry and then plays the piano for her . " It was a perfect background for Margot 's story . Jim went in heavily for contrast . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd do a couple of Chopin preludes and then swing into boogie-woogie . I was n't conscious , though , that night of what he was playing . The music was just there . The story she was telling was a variation of the Tristan and Isolde theme . Some way or other she wove the story around and I forgot the room and the people in it , and I was the Isolde who was left waiting . I was the Isolde who sat and watched the sea for a ship that was never to come . It may be that she saw the tears in my eyes , because she was putting me into it . I turned from the fire to find her looking at me . She was repeating that line of Elizabeth Barrett Browning 's : " Strange cancellings must ink the eternal books when love crossed out will bring the answer right . " She knew about me . She could see the thing I thought was  | so carefully hidden . It was , strangely , a relief to have someone know . Someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by her eyes ; I was watching her face closely , and I saw a change come over it . It hardened , her words stopped , her lips were pressed together , and when she opened them it was to a loud whisper , " That cat . " Lips pressed together again , head held stiff , " That cat is in the room . " I heard Spike say , " Oh damn ! " I saw Bernard and George scramble up , and heard Bernard 's voice , coaxing , " Here , Mister , come on , Mister . Nice kitty . " The cat meowed . Margot shivered . George said , " I 've got him . " Bernard said crossly , " Throw him out in the hall and close the door . No , start him down the stairs and tell Jim to put him outside . " When the door was shut she relaxed . She pushed back her hair , looked at me apologetically . " I 'm sorry . " I did n't see why she should apologize . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phobias , Jennie , about cats . I used to think it was put on until one night . Remember , Margot , when Jim was playing the piano ? " " Yes , I remember . " He turned to me . " There was a musical crowd out here and Jim was doing something important on the piano . Nobody could breathe , or he 'd get a nasty look . I was sitting beside Margot , bored with it all , and I saw her hands clenched in her lap . I looked at her face , and she was biting her lip , and the tears were simply streaming down . I was scared . I thought she was going to have a seizure of some kind . Then I saw Mister Blister . He was ambling around among the guests . I put my arm around Margot and she was trembling all over . Fortunately the cat decided to go into the kitchen , and she relaxed . " " But could n't you be psychoanalyzed , Margot ? " She shrugged her shoulders . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychoanalyzed so that you would n't scream at the sight of a snake coming toward you ? " I had n't thought of it that way before . George said slowly , " That 's a peculiar thing , Margot . I 've never heard you scream . " " I could n't scream  --  not if I tried . " She shook her head . " Let 's not talk about it . " Bernard settled down . " Finish the story , Margot . " " Oh , I 'm out of the mood now . Anyway " ? faintly I could see the smile on her face as she turned it away from the fire ? " anyway , it has an unhappy ending . " We sat around a while longer until the fire started going down . Spike said , " Why do n't you people go to bed ? Maybe you have n't realized that George and I ca n't retire until you get out of our bedroom . " We left one lamp for them and started into the hall . I looked around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The hall went clear up to the roof . Shining out of Margot 's bedroom on the second floor was the lamp she had left burning when she came down . She turned to Bernard . " Do you have my flash , Bernard ? " I looked for the stairway . There was n't any . A ladder . The ladder . Steep and high it went up to the next floor . But now it had railings on each side . We stood , watching her go up . When she got to the top she leaned over the railing that lined the second floor . Her hair fell down over her shoulder . " Good night . And I am not going to quote the balcony scene . " Bernard and I went on downstairs . Jim was still playing , softly . Delia was lying on one of the couches , her eyes closed . Bernard went into their bedroom . I sat down and lit a cigarette . " That Margot has more courage than I have . I would n't want to sleep up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? deep in the bass notes of the piano . " Margot is n't afraid of anything . " Delia did n't open her eyes . " Except cats . "  | " Oh well , that . That 's something she ca n't help . It 's a phobia . " Delia stirred . " Poor Mister Blister . " Jim came away from the piano . " The pampered beast . " " Not pampered when Margot 's here . Never gets into the house except at night . He walks into a room expecting a friendly greeting and everybody yells and throws him out . " She sat up , rubbed her eyes . " That 's why she sleeps up there alone , Jennie . Mister Blister wo n't climb that ladder . You do n't mind cats , do you ? " " No , I like them . Always have . " " That 's good . Because the minute everyone is in bed Mother Parry will let him in and he 'll sleep in the room with you two . How 's about going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grabbed a flashlight from the table , and started up the stairway . Delia went into the bedroom with me for an instant , then went on into her own room . I undressed . The room was small and it was warmer than the other rooms because the water heater was over in the corner . Pretty soon Mother Parry came in . She was wearing a blue flannelette nightgown and robe . Her gray hair was braided neatly . She carried an orange and a paper napkin . " I thought you might like an orange before you go to sleep . " It was fun . I sat up in bed eating the orange while she puttered around , talking . Just before she turned out the light she came over and saw that the covers were tucked in around my shoulders and my knees . Then she stood up on a cane-bottomed chair to open the high window . She unfastened the screen and whistled . " Come , Mister , come , Mister . " I could hear the bushes move as he came through . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her bed , and from there to the floor . He curled up near the heater . " Good night , my dear . " She turned out the light . I did n't go to sleep for a long time . " Strange cancellings . " Maybe someday the memories would be good . Not yet . Things  | that were lovely once plagued me now . Things I had said . I need n't have told him how much I loved him . I need n't have been so  --  so easy . I had made the mistake of believing his words because my own words were true . I heard the clock strike two and two-thirty . It rained for a bit . A slow rain . No wonder they said the ghost was only heard by people who 'd been disappointed in love . They were probably the only ones awake to hear . But the ghost did n't appear to me . Only my own ghost ? my own private ghost  --  that was n't at all fragile or blond ... . Saturday Morning I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was standing in the doorway of the bedroom . She was wearing very rumpled tailored pajamas , and she had clothes hanging over her arms . " Do you mind if I dress in here by the heater ? It 's the only warm spot in the house . " I mumbled something about its being quite all right , trying to get myself awake . She was already in the room . " I guess I 'm the first one up , except Mother Parry , of course . I hope you did n't want to sleep , but I 'd have wakened you anyway , because I hate not having anyone to talk to . Is your hair naturally curly ? Gosh , did I leave my socks upstairs ? Oh no , here they are . " " Good morning . " It was Mother Parry , carrying a tray with a steaming cup of coffee and a package of cigarettes . I sat up . " You must have read my mind , Mother Parry . " " I 'm bringing you a cup the next trip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding a piece of underwear in her hands . Stark naked . Just as natural as anything .  | " Oh , please , Mother Parry . " She was slim and muscular , her skin tanned a deep brown except around the middle . Mother Parry hit Peg 's firm little fanny as she walked by her . " No modesty , no modesty at all any more . " Peg started pulling on a pair of pants . " You 'll find , Mother Parry , that modest girls have something to be ashamed of . They 've got pimples or they bulge , or they 're scrawny and bony . " " Nonsense . " Peg giggled after Mother Parry had gone out . " She 's so cute . She pretends to be shocked at me standing here without anything on , but she is n't . " She was putting on her shoes . " I guess nothing really could shock Mother Parry . You know , " and her voice had a grown-up tinge to it and it sounded as though she were repeating , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffee was hot and strong . " Has she been through a lot ? " " Oh yes . " She sounded like a very small child repeating a story she 'd heard her elders tell . " The old situation  --  a drunken , no-good husband , and she shoved him out , divorced him in spite of the stigma against such a thing in those days . Then she went to work and reared Bernard . Taught school and worked in stores and pinched and saved and got him educated . Really , a marvelous story . " She was combing her thick long bob . She started whispering , " Of course Margot says " ? I was to notice all day the special significance Peg always gave to anything Margot said ? " that it 's the old story of the silver cord . That now Bernard ca n't get out from under the domination of his mother , and Delia has never been strong enough , mentally or sexually , to break that cord . " She started braiding her hair ; her next words were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cute . " Her voice came from the doorway . " Cute ! You know I dislike that word , Peg . " She set the cup of coffee down on the dressing table .  | Peg grabbed her around the waist and lifted her off the floor . " But you are cute . I love you dearly because you 're cute . " Mother Parry 's voice was angry . " Put me down . At once . Peg ! " I think even Peg was startled . She set her down . " You know how I dislike being small  --  and even more , people who make a point of mentioning it . " " I 'm sorry . Oh , Mother Parry , I am sorry . " Mother Parry sat down on her bed . Her feet did n't touch the floor . She was smiling now . " The tactless young . " Peg sat cross-legged on the floor between the two beds . " You forgive me , then ? " " This time , yes . " The three of us had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spike 's voice in the doorway . He had a sweater on over his pajamas , a cup of coffee in his hand , and he needed a shave badly . " Do you people have to get up at the crack of dawn ? " To me , " Move your feet , sugar , and let me sit down . " He pointed a finger accusingly at Peg and almost spilled his coffee . " It 's your fault , young'un . Going to bed with the sun ! You 're a grown girl now , you do n't have to go to bed early any more . But if you must get up , why do n't you sit down and read a good book , or go out and commune with nature ? " " I did n't make any noise . I did n't make a sound . I just came down and wakened Jennie and she did n't mind . " " Not a sound . Oh no . You dropped something when you got out of bed . A hunk of lead or steel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , that . Yes , I did drop one of my shoes ? " " And you were singing . I distinctly heard you singing . And  --  " " Oh hush . If it were n't for me you people 'd come out here and stay up all night and sleep all day . " " And why not ? " I 'd never held open house before in my bedroom . It was n't  | long until everyone was there . Except Margot . The room filled with smoke . Mother Parry made more coffee . Bernard told stories  --  in dialect . I laughed until my stomach hurt . The stories were all slightly obscene . Mister Blister sat curled up on Mother Parry 's lap , purring contentedly as she scratched his neck . Jim begged her to sing one of her songs for us . It was delightful . She sat there so small and bright-eyed . George was propped up at the head of her bed , Delia leaning against his knees . Bernard sat on the only chair , the straight cane-bottomed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She prefaced the song with a story . " I remember when it was popular . There was a young man in our town who 'd been going with a milliner . To everyone 's surprise , he married the daughter of the owner of the flour mill . It was a big wedding and we all wondered whether the milliner would come . She did . I 'll never forget her walking around among the guests . And the orchestra played this song . " I 'll be all smiles tonight , love ; I 'll be all smiles tonight . . . . Though my heart may break tomorrow , I 'll be all smiles tonight . " She did n't have a good voice , but we were all quiet as she sang , quiet for an instant after she stopped . Jim said , " The popular songs then were all sad like that , were n't they , Mother Parry ? That other one you sing . " And he began in his deep voice : " I do n't know why I love him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still my poor heart wonders , Wherever he may be . . . " Peter had said once , " They never write songs about brown eyes . I know only one ? ' Brown Eyes , Why Are You Blue ? ' ? but your eyes are never sad , so how could I sing that song to  | you ? There should be one about brown eyes that sparkle and light up . " Silly , inane songs that could tear the heart out of you : " I do n't know why I love him , for he does not care for me ... " Mother Parry was laughing . " From what I hear over the radio , they have n't changed much . " Jim nodded slowly . " I guess you 're right at that . " Peg clapped her hands . " Oh , Jim , go out and play for us now . " Bernard turned his head . " You 'll waken Margot . " Spike mused , " Of course it might be interesting . Maybe Jennie has never seen a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spike ! That 's nasty . You 're always saying mean things about Margot . " She added spitefully : " Just because she wo n't pay any attention to you . " I was surprised to see him flush , but his voice was bantering . " Wipe your nose , kid . And do n't go around making remarks like that or someone will paddle your little bottom . " Delia stood up . " I 'm hungry . How about the rest of you ? " It seemed everyone was hungry . She started detailing duties . " Peg and Mother Parry and George and I will get breakfast because we 're the only ones dressed . You guys get into your clothes while we 're about it , and then you can clean up the dishes afterward . " Eight people around the big table . Pitchers of fruit juice , small sausages , waffles , maple syrup  --  and ripe pears to finish up with . I ate so much I was groggy . They got into a discussion of freedom of speech  --  and did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get into the argument . George was quiet and logical about it . Spike and Bernard yelled . Peg said , " My gosh , Spike , it does n't help any to shout . You ca n't make your arguments any better by yelling them . " Mother Parry pattered around the table , refilling cups . Delia sat back in her chair , smoking , not joining in the argument , but listening .  | George never got angry . He 'd talk with a half-smile on his face . " But , Bernard , you ca n't say that you believe in democracy , and then in the next breath say that we 've got to muzzle the morons . " " I suppose " ? his face was red ? " I suppose we should let those crackpot communists go around saying what they please , breaking down our Government  --  " George 's smooth , unhurried voice broke in . " A democracy presupposes the right of minority groups to be heard . " " Margot says " ? Peg laid down the stern of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important , that  --  " Bernard interrupted . " Margot ! My gosh , she 'll be getting up pretty soon . Mother , where 's the cat ? " " I have already put him out . I anticipated Margot 's getting up . " " Oh , do n't act so martyred , Mother . The darn cat would rather be outside anyway . " It was n't long until she came down . I 've never liked slacks on women , but I had to admit to myself that Margot was the exception . They were beige wool , beautifully pressed . Below she was flat fore and aft , nicely curved above . Her hair shone in the sunlight as she sat down beside me at the table . Delia plugged in the waffle iron . It was interesting to see how she immediately became the focal point . We were all turned to her . You know how people sitting around a fire ca n't seem to take their eyes away from it . That was the way it was . All of us turned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I caught myself being glad that she had sat down beside me , I tried to pull myself away . I talked to Delia , who was busy with the waffles . I got up and went out to the kitchen and watched Mother Parry frying sausages . And when I went back and sat down I was enough out of it to catch something strange . George . George was over in the corner reading a magazine . I remembered the way he 'd looked at her last night . She must have been wondering too ,  | because she kept calling over to him . " George , bring me my cigarettes . " He turned a page of the magazine . " Are n't there cigarettes on the table ? " " But , George dear , you know I ca n't smoke Luckies . " Jim spoke up . " I 'll get them , Margot . Where are they ? " The talk around the table went on . A few minutes later , " George , would you mind closing that window above you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and closed it without answering . She laughed . " Grumpy this morning , is n't he ? " That may have been it . Maybe he was one of these moody people . I looked back to the scene in my bedroom and it seemed to me now that he had been quieter than the others , that he had n't joined in . It was just then , when my mind was wandering off , that she singled me out . The only reason I could figure out for her doing it was that she was annoyed with George , who did n't seem to be coming to heel as he should , so she had to take it out on someone , and I was handy . " Did you hear the ghost last night , Jennie ? " Stupidly I repeated , " Did I hear the ghost ? " Jim , making matters worse , said , " Why , Jennie is n't eligible for the ghost . " And Delia , being protective , laughed . " Heavens , no . Not Jennie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't . The blackness of those hours , lying sleepless on the narrow bed , were swimming over me . I dropped the hand holding my cigarette down to my side . I did n't want them to see how it was shaking . Her voice was clear and  --  and smug . " I think she might have . I think she very likely might have . Poor Jennie . " And she reached over and put her arm around my shoulders . Poor Jennie , with her heart in her eyes , being so gay and deceiving , but she could n't fool Aunt Margot . Oh no . " I was furious with myself . The faces around the table were  | blurred to me , but I could see the look of surprise on Jim 's face . I knew what he was thinking . He was thinking , That 's right , I have n't seen her and Peter together lately . Awful , to see the embarrassment on Spike 's face , and the eager curiosity of young Peg . Delia 's face was white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words were as false as her laugh . " Wrong steer this time , Margot . Jennie goes gaga over no man . Not our self-sufficient Jennie . " Margot paid no attention . She smiled at me . " Did you hear the ghost ? " George had come over to the table . He reached out and picked up a pear . " Did you hear anything at all , Jennie ? " I shook my head . The others , too , were surprised at his asking me . He took a bite of the pear . He was looking at Margot . " I do n't believe in ghosts , but I agree with Margot . Jennie might very likely have heard footsteps . " He walked away from the table . Peg said , " What , George , what ? " Spike put in , " Me , maybe . If it 's not too indelicate to mention , I got up to go to the bathroom . " We all laughed , except Margot . And Jim said , " You 'd hardly sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I caught the movement of Margot 's hands on her lap and looked down . She was tearing the paper napkin in little bits . The pieces were scattered over her lap . Mother Parry came back into the room just in time to hear Jim 's remark about the ghost . " I wish you would n't talk about it . Although " ? she looked around the table ? " I do n't think we 've any hysterical people this week end to worry about . " I was to remember what she said the next night , remember it while I was clenching my hands to keep from screaming . It was the thing that kept me quiet in the darkness . I did n't want Mother Parry to think me hysterical . I was to suffer for a few minutes , that seemed to last forever , the peculiar awful terror  | of the coward trying to be brave . Because of a few words spoken over a gay breakfast table . Saturday Afternoon I WAS FURIOUS with Margot after that little scene . Furious at myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakfast dishes were cleaned up I went into my bedroom to comb my hair . She followed me in and squatted on the foot of the bed . Talked very pleasantly . I was lucky to have naturally curly hair . The way I fixed it was becoming . She was disarming . I could n't be stiff with her . It was n't long until you 'd have thought we were a couple of bosom pals  --  discussing how we liked nylon hose , what kind of slips we wore , and she knew a marvelous kind of face cream that was terribly inexpensive . She wanted to know whether my suit was custom-made . That really got me . It was . I 'd paid ninety-five dollars for it , and there were n't many people who realized that it was n't a little number I 'd picked up for nineteen ninety-five . I do n't know how long we talked . Peg burst into the room . " Hey , what goes on here ? We want to get up a hike . " She stood beside Margot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached up , patted her hand . " We 'll be right with you , angel . " Peg leaned down , put her face in Margot 's hair , kind of nuzzled it . " Uhmmm , you smell so nice . " She turned to me . " Is n't she beautiful ? " " Oh , Peg ! " " But you are . " Spike yelled from the other room , " Well , whoever 's going to hike , come on . "  | We went out into the living room . George said he was going to stay in and read . They coaxed , but they could n't budge him . And when I discovered what a long hike they were planning I was n't much interested either . Mother Parry suggested that I might go down to the store with her  --  it was a comfortable mile walk . So they started out , George went up to his room , and Mother Parry and I went to the store . It was a beautiful day . Warm , as the days sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn . Mother Parry and I walked slowly . She talked constantly  --  about the trees , and the few flowers we saw , and the houses we passed  --  who lived in them , how many children they had . All pleasant comfortable gossip . Somehow or other I mentioned Spike . She said , " Oh , Spike 's a fine young man . One of the best . I was so glad when he and Margot broke their engagement . " I was stunned . " Were they engaged ? " " Heavens , yes . " " But what happened ? " " Nobody knows . Suddenly they were n't engaged any more . Margot , I think , likes to make people believe that Spike was not quite artistic enough for her . But I have an idea " ? and she smiled a pleased smile ? " that Spike had more to do with the breaking of the engagement than she 'd want anyone to know . " " She 's very lovely . " " Yes " ? such a bitter yes ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " On the way back from the store she suggested that we stop to visit Mrs. Somebody-or-other . She thought I might like to see her house and her antiques . But I was sleepy , and walking along in the warm sunlight had made me even more sleepy , so I said I guessed I 'd go on back to the house and take a nap . When I opened the door and walked into the house it was horribly quiet  --  and dark . There was a disadvantage to those  | basement windows : the sun did n't come in except when it was low in the sky . I walked through the big living room . It seemed silly to turn on the lights at that hour of the day . It was much colder inside than outside . I hurried into my bedroom , took off my shoes , and lay down . I was sorry I had n't gone with Mother Parry . It was the damned house and the story Jim had told me . Not a sound except the ticking of the big clock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was walking through caverns , desperately trying to find light . I saw Margot ahead of me , but I could n't catch up to her , and I wanted to because she was n't afraid of anything . When I wakened out of that dream it was to the realization of something I 'd been trying to fix to Margot . That poem of Swinburne 's . My roommate and I had memorized it at school . Bright heavy brow well gathered up , White gloss and sheen ; Carved lips that make my lips a cup To drink , Faustine . I heard her voice and thought for a minute that I was imagining things . But it was Margot , and I realized I was listening to a very private conversation . I should have stopped my ears . But I did n't . I snooped . I eavesdropped . I could n't help it . " Darling , I ca n't , truly I ca n't understand why you 're so strange today . " George said , " You ca n't ? Even after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakfast table ? " Silence for a minute . I listened shamelessly . Her voice was amused . " I suppose you saw Bernard lumbering up the ladder to my room in the middle of the night . " " You 're not going to make a joke of it ? " " And why not , silly ? Bernard had something he wanted to discuss with me . It 's difficult enough to find a chance to talk  | in this house and not have Mother Parry snooping around listening . " I did blush , there by myself , but even so , I turned over on my back so that both ears were free . " Margot , do you think me an awful fool ? " " Well , it 's the truth . That is what happened . " He must have taken hold of her because she said , " George , you 're hurting me . " His voice was awful to hear  --  low , but perfectly clear to me . " I 've loved you , Margot , with a kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing any man touch you , even to shaking your hand . Last night I went through hell . " The tenseness relaxed a little . " We seem to have had quite a procession to the bathroom . I got up shortly after Jim and opened our door . I saw the flashlight and realized Bernard was going to you . I went back to bed . " A long silence . " And lay in the darkness knowing . . . " His voice was even , ordinary . " For the first time in my life I knew what it meant to want to kill . I wanted to go up and strangle you both . " The quietness was worse than the words . What were they doing ? Were they standing looking at each other ? " And you ask me what 's wrong with me today . . . . " Why did n't she say something ? But from George 's next words , I realized she was n't going to try to use words . " No  --  that wo n't do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " But , darling . " Her voice was muffled , as though her mouth was buried . " Sit down , Margot . " He must have pushed her . I heard the springs of the old chair in the corner creak . " Sit down and relax . We 're through , finished , washed up . You could kiss me from now until midnight , and it would n't mean a thing to me . Not a thing . " I could hear him walk out Of the room and up the stairs . It was then I saw Mister Blister . He had been lying curled  | up by the heater , and he was standing stretching . He twirled his heavy tail and started into the living room . I lay there tense . I did n't know what to do . I could n't call to him or go out there or she would know I had heard . I could hear her whimpering . It was a small tight sound . I expected her to say , " Go away , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And I lay there , helpless to do anything . Suddenly there was a loud noise of something being thrown , and Mister Blister let out an ugly snarl . And the whimpering stopped . A few minutes later there were voices . " Well , Margot ! What are you doing , sitting there all curled up in that chair ? " " That cat was in here . " She was crying . " I threw a book at him . " Bernard 's loud voice said , " You poor thing . " Peg sympathized . " Oh , how awful , Margot . And you with a headache , too . I knew I should have come back with you . Did you get an aspirin ? Jim , go hunt the cat and put him out of the house . " Jim asked , " Why do I always have to put him out ? I like him . He likes me , but pretty soon he wo n't . " I could hear him walking around . " Here , Mister , here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start looking for me and I could pretend to have been asleep . I fell asleep before anyone thought of me , and when Delia came in I really had to be wakened . She ruffled my hair . " I thought you 'd come out here and be one of those athletic girls , tramping the dunes and being too , too active . Instead you spend all of your time sleeping . " I went out into the living room . You 'd never have known that anything had happened . Margot and Peg and Spike were setting the big table for dinner . George was broiling steaks in the kitchen . Delia and Mother Parry were doing the less interesting things  --  potatoes and vegetables . Jim was at the piano , and Bernard was reading a bunch of newspapers , bawling out bits of news to the others as they worked .  | I was still half asleep . I sat down and watched them . They were n't quite real to me . I looked at Bernard  --  it was n't possible that he could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Margot was laughing in the kitchen . I heard her say , " Broil one a long time for me , George , I like them well done . " I might have dreamed the whole thing . It could all have been a part of my imagination . But when Margot came in and stretched on the couch ? " Play something dreamy , Jim " ? I watched her with curiosity . Peg strode into the room and sat down on the floor by the couch . Margot touched Peg 's hair with her hand . " Angel , " she said , and Peg leaned back , took hold of Margot 's hand , and held it . Bernard had dropped his newspapers . Margot smiled at him . I knew then that I had n't dreamed it . You could n't mistake the lazy , slow , intimate smile . There was only one lamp lighted , the one by the piano . The room was dark  --  even though it was still twilight outside . The light touched Margot 's hair , put shadows under her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breasts . I looked away from her at Jim . His broad shoulders were hunched , his big hands touching the keys lightly . It was something minor he was playing . It must have been modern  --  the suggestion of discords . The light of the lamp shone on the keys and sent a shadow of Jim against the opposite wall  --  an enlarged frightening shadow  --  like an ape or a gorilla . His voice cut into his music . " This is your song , Margot . " She opened her eyes . " Mine ? " " Do n't you recognize yourself ? " I did n't think before I spoke . " There are words to it too . " I do n't believe any of them had realized I was there . " Lean back , and get some minute 's peace ; Let your head lean Back to the shoulder with its fleece Of locks , Faustine.  | " The shapely silver shoulder stoops , Weighed over clean With state of splendid hair that droops Each side , Faustine . " Jim timed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your good gifts That crown you queen ; A queen whose kingdom ebbs and shifts Each week , Faustine . " Peg dropped Margot 's hand , sat up straight . " Why , Jennie , that 's beautiful . It is like Margot ? ' your good gifts that crown you queen . ' It 's wonderful . " Jim 's hands dropped down to the bass keys , he repeated , " Whose kingdom ebbs and shifts ... " ' He looked over his shoulder at me . " It does fit the music . " Margot 's voice was clear , sharp . " Nice of you to stop when you did . " Peg turned her head to Margot . " Why , Margot ? Is there more ? " She laughed , brushed back Peg 's hair . " More , much more , angel . " She twisted her head toward Jim . " Music , Jim , the same , please . " And she went on with the poem : " Wine and rank poison , milk and blood , Being mixed therein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For you , Faustine . " She thought a minute . " I ca n't just remember  --  something about " God said , Let him that wins her take And keep , Faustine . " " Peg shook her head . " Now you 've spoiled it . That 's awful . I do n't like that . "  | " If you were n't such a little animal , angel , you 'd probably just now be going through the same stage Jennie and I did . " She looked over at me . " I 'm assuming that you did outgrow Swinburne . I mean after those lush undergraduate days . " I was huddled back in my chair , sorry that I 'd opened my mouth . " Hand me a cigarette , will you , angel ? " Angel and Bernard both rushed for the cigarettes . Saturday Evening I DID N'T ENJOY DINNER . They were noisy . Delia and I did n't talk much . I wondered whether she knew , and did n't see how she could help knowing . The way they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every now and then , as though he were used to touching her , as though he could n't keep his hands off her . It made me a little sick . I wished I had n't come . Delia was spoiled for me . I 'd envied her . She 'd always been sure of herself . I 'd thought , At least here 's one person who 's solved the riddle of being happy . Her life looked ordered and pleasant . She 'd been to me one of those people it was good to be around , probably because she had about her a kind of inner glow of contentment . Now she was like the rest of us . Now that look of contentment was a facade . They decided that , inasmuch as it was Saturday night , we 'd have to go out somewhere and pitch one . " We 'll go down , " said Spike , " and see what goes on at the Bucket of Blood  --  " " Bucket of Blood ? " I asked . Bernard explained , " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . It 's one of those places so coyly called a neighborhood tavern . It 's in a little town about five miles from here , and all the people from that town gather there on Saturday evening . Families . Everybody knows everybody else . " Spike was struggling to light a pipe , his heavy eyebrows drawn down . " Fights too , Jennie . You dive under the table to avoid the bottles . " " Oh , it 's not that bad , Spike . " He grinned . " Distinctly lower-class , however . They come in work clothes and house dresses . People spit on the floor . " Peg 's voice was querulous . " I do n't know why you do n't stay home . " " Well , you could come with us . " " Not me . " They were all laughing . Spike turned to me . " Peg wo n't go there any more because her dignity was hurt . They would n't serve her a drink . Said she was under age . Made her show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot . " That 's not the reason . It 's dirty , and it smells . They have cockroaches crawling over the walls . " George patted her shoulder . " We 'll have fun here at the house , Peg . We can have a fine time playing cribbage . " Her face lit up . " Oh , George , are you going to stay home ? " " Yep . I prefer Bernard 's beer and ale to the Bucket of Blood 's . " Bernard 's loud voice complained , " You sure are n't throwing yourself into this party , George . No hiking , staying home and playing cribbage . Not feeling your age , are you ? " Mother Parry put in quickly , " Well , I do n't see myself why you all want to go down there . Drinking , and then driving up the hill . . . " I was worried that they would decide not to go . I wanted to . I wanted to get out of the house . I thought it would be fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotions . I do n't often want to get drunk , but that evening I did .  | It was a long time before we could get started . We washed the dishes , we got dressed . Before we left , Mother Parry sang another of her songs , this time to an accompaniment by Jim . They told me , as they were asking her to sing it , that it was a scream . " Funniest thing you ever heard . You ca n't understand how anyone could write anything like it . " " Sort of a bastard ballad . " She sang it seriously . It did n't strike me as being awfully funny . " In yonder lowly valley , Where the violets fade and bloom , There lies my fair Luella , A-moldering in her tomb . " She died not brokenhearted , Nor by disease she fell , But in one moment departed From friends she loved so well . " One night the moon shone brightly , The stars were shining , too , When to her cottage lightly , Her jealous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us wander , Amidst the woods so gay , While wandering we may ponder , Upon our wedding day . ' " Deep , deep into the forest , He bears his love so dear , " T is only for you , Willie , That I am wandering here ,  | " ' The way grows dark and dreary , And I 'm afraid to stay , While wandering we 'll grow weary , I would retrace my way . ' " ' Retrace your steps , no , never ! No more these vales you 'll roam , So bid farewell , forever , To parents , friends , and home . ' " ' Farewell , kind loving parents , I ne'er shall see you more , Long , long , you 'll wait my coining , At the little cottage door . ' " Down on her knees before him , She pleaded for her life , When deep into her bosom , He plunged the fatal knife . " ' Dear Willie , I forgive you , ' Was her last dying breath , I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death . " The last line she sang so low and softly that it was like a benediction . Jim carried on the eerie music just for a minute or two , so that there was n't immediate laughter . No one said anything . My hands were clammy . It was Margot who broke the silence . " The part that really slays me is how meekly fair Luella gives in to her doom . Would n't you think she 'd have put up a fight of some kind ? " " What makes it ridiculous is the jealous lover 's name . Willie ! Of all things , Willie . " George took a sip of his long dark drink . " But that makes it  | authentic . Must our men who kill for love have romantic names ? " Margot 's voice was brittle . " And now George will give us his dissertation on how things like murder and incest and adultery always happen to very ordinary people . " " But they do , Margot . It 's the suburban housewife who kills her husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an ax . It 's the quiet schoolteacher who goes berserk and shoots her respectable married lover . You writers mess up the facts . You go to a lot of trouble to cast a halo of excitement , of color , of atmosphere around your characters . " He took another drink . " But I suppose you have to . Most of us are n't interested in reading about greengrocers , or the kind of people we work beside . " Spike leaned forward . " You know , a few years ago at the office we did a silly thing . Some insurance company sent out an ad . I do n't remember it exactly  --  something about taking ten people you know  --  and within so many years one would be dead of illness , one by violence , one would be crippled . That sort of thing . We thought it was funny . We took the number of people they suggested , wrote the names on a sheet of paper , sealed it in an envelope , and put it in the vault . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What a perfectly ghastly thing to do ! " " We destroyed it three months later . One of the men said to me , Damn it , it 's like a doom hanging over my head . ' That 's about the way I felt . So we took it out and tore it up . The only thing I regret " ? he hesitated ? " I ca n't forget those names . It 's as though , as long as I remember them , they 're hexed . " Margot said dryly , " Well , to think of the practical Spike ever having a twinge of psychic premonition  --  or superstitious worry . " He grinned . " It is funny , is n't it ? I 'm a bit ashamed of it . More ashamed when I remember " ? he was leaning forward ,  | twisting his pipe in his hands ? " when I remember how relieved I was when one of those names was crippled in an automobile accident . " " Oh , Spike ! " It was Delia 's voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself for that . Even in the first horror of hearing about it I was still selfish enough to think immediately , One chance lifted from my shoulders . Death is n't so hard to take  --  but being crippled ... Lord , I never thought I 'd tell that to anyone . " Peg asked , " You did n't put any of our names on that list , did you ? " He laughed . " Think I 'd tell you if I had ? " Margot said , " Probably mine . I remember your talking about it . We were pretty good friends then . " " I would hardly have put your name on it , being wildly in love with you at the time . " She shrugged her shoulders . " Palmists always tell me I have a short life line . " Jim broke in . " Jennie reads palms ; let her take a look at it . " I shook my head . " I 'd rather not . " But as usual , when anyone says you read palms or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finally I said , " Well , all right , I 'll look at Margot 's  --  but no one else 's . I 'm not in the mood . " No one ever believes me when I say I take palm reading seriously . Peter used to say that the reason I saw a person 's character in his hand was because I understood them so quickly that I read into their palms the things I 'd already discovered subconsciously . Anyway , I had a pretty good idea what I 'd see in Margot 's . I 'd already noticed her pointed fingers that mean a poetic strain to a palmist ; I 'd seen the crooked little finger that denotes the writer . I took her hand in mine . It was soft and white on the back , but when I turned it over I saw that it was wrinkled  --  crossed with lines  --  like an old woman 's . Large imagination bump , large sex bump . The way she held her  | fingers showed the person who acts conventionally and thinks unconventionally . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , the thing that in reading palms for years I 'd never come across before , was this . Across her palm ran a strong head line . There was no heart line . None at all . I 've seen them faint and difficult to discern , but I 'd never seen a hand without one . It means a completely ruthless person . It means a person who never considers anyone else . It 's the next thing to a murderer 's mark in a palm . It shocked me . I did n't know what to say . They were all quiet , waiting for me . Margot laughed . " Is it as bad as all that ? Go ahead , Jennie , give me the works . I can take it . " I decided to do just that . There was a score I needed to settle . " It 's not the short life line that surprised me . It 's this . I 've never before seen a hand without a heart line . " One of the men laughed . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spike 's voice when he said , " Maybe there is something to this palm business after all . " Margot 's voice was cool . " Just what does the lack of a heart line mean ? " " The most utter selfishness . You apparently do everything , plan everything , think of everything only in relation to yourself . " Young Peg shrieked , " That 's not true . " Margot said quietly , " But it is true . And why not ? I imagine that 's pretty generally true of everyone . Few people will admit it , however . " I went on with the reading . I told her about the artistic bent shown in her palm  --  and a lot of stuff . She asked me about marriage . I said there was no marriage but there was a child . I had said it casually , not expecting any reaction  --  unless it might amuse her . She jerked her hand from mine and stood up . I thought she was going to have a tantrum right then and  | there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She did n't . She turned to the others , who had started to laugh but stopped when she jumped up . " Now that Jennie has had her little field day , shall we go ? " Spike and I drove in his small car . Delia and Bernard and Jim and Margot went in Bernard 's car . We seemed to drive a long distance before we got to the tavern , but Spike and I did n't talk much . The tavern was on the main street of the small town . One business block . Two grocery stores , a general store , three taverns , a garage , and a hardware store . The tavern we stopped at was called Mike 's Place . Neon signs outside , venetian blinds . It did smell . The minute you walked in the smell hit you in the face . A front room with a long bar . The men turned and looked us over as we walked on to the room in the back where there were tables and booths . There was a raised platform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guitar . We sat around a big table to the rear . Things were pretty quiet then . Someone was shooting one of those machine-gun machines  --  that noise thudded through the room . I tried to see the people but it was dark and at first I could n't make them out . We had a round of drinks , and another round . We danced . Spike was a pretty good dancer . Ile and I went out to the bar and had a shot there . He said , " So you 're not Jim 's girl ? " " Heavens , no . Whatever gave you that idea ? " " Oh  --  he brought you out last night . " " I 've known him since we were in third grade . That 's why Delia suggested that he bring me . She knew we were friends . " " That 's good , " he said . When we went back to the table I was definitely on the way to being tight . I was feeling very good . I saw that Bernard and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jim were arguing music . Delia was feeling her liquor too . I  | could tell because she kept repeating things . " I do n't care , I like Tchaikovsky . Go ahead " ? belligerently to Jim ? " tell me I 'm adolescent . I still like him . " About that time the orchestra started playing things you could sing . And we sang . How we sang ! We put our arms around one another 's necks and swayed back and forth to the music . Margot and Bernard came back for an instant . They were both sober . Cold sober . They stood there and looked down on us . Which expresses it just right . " Sit down  --  sit down , " Jim yelled . " We 'll make it a sextet . " Margot said , " You 're too noisy . " " Well , go on away then . Go on away and be dignified . " They did just that . They walked over and sat down in a corner booth . I wondered hazily several times what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't pay much attention . I seemed to be having a fine time . The fiddler came over to our table and played what we asked him to . Some woman joined us . She was squat , but she could sing like a bird . She and Jim directed us . She stopped once and bawled me out for changing keys all the time . Jim said , " What 's a key or two among friends ? " The accordionist and the guitarist were there , too , and the fiddler was directing with his bow . People clapped and called numbers for us to sing . I began to worry about Margot and Bernard . There they were  --  not having any fun . I said to Spike , " Let 's get Margot and Bernard . " " The hell with them , " he said . It became an obsession with me . You know how those things are . So I got up . I suppose everybody feels the same way when they 're slightly schnozzled . You know you 're doing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So I walked over to their booth . I said , " Come on over and join the party . Do n't sit here like a couple of stick-in-the-muds . " I knew that did n't sound  | right . " A couple of sticks-in-the-mud . " I started to giggle . I put my hand up over my mouth and I giggled . I looked at Bernard . His face was set . My head was foggy , but I tried to think . There was something wrong with Bernard . The only thing I could think was that he was sick . That was it . He looked as people do that minute before they rush to the johnny . I grabbed hold of Margot 's arm . " He 's sick . Look at him . He 's going to vomit . " She shook my hand off . It almost sobered me , the way she did it . The same thing had happened to me once before . When I was working in the manager 's office of a department store and one of the clerks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went over to her and put my arm across her shoulders because I could n't stand her sobbing . And she 'd thrown my arm off and pushed me so that I lost my balance . The store click had taken hold of her shoulders and had shaken her . " Keep your dirty hands off Miss Simpson . " And she 'd screamed , " Tell her to keep her dirty hands off me . " That 's the way Margot shook me off . There was the most utter disgust in her face . " You 're drunk , " she said , " and , I might add , slightly on the disorderly side . " " O.K. , " I said , believing I was being very dignified , " O.K. , have it your own way . Be stuffy . " I looked at Bernard again . He still looked sick . His eyes were down . I went back to our table . They 'd stopped singing . Delia and Jim were dancing . Spike pulled out my chair . " Did you get put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said , " yes , I did . And I 'd like to push her in the face . " " Why did n't you ? She 's been asking for it for years . " " I think I will . " I shoved back my chair . " Hey , wait a minute . " He put his arm around my shoulders . " Let 's skip it for tonight . After all , Jennie , who are we , you and I , to be instruments of justice ? Someday the fates will take a hand , and little Margot will get paid off . "  | " Yeah . That kind never do  --  does . " I seemed to be having an awful time with my grammar . " They go on and on and end up millionaires . " " Yeah , but , honey , they burn in hell later on . " " Nuts . She 'll look at St. Peter once , and he 'll think what a beautiful angel she 'd make . " " Not St. Peter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name ? " Delia plopped down . " St. Peter . Incorruptible . Have we missed something exciting ? Let 's forget our troubles and whoop ' er up . " Jim sighed , " I 'm not going to worry about getting you guys home . Me . Why am I always the goat ? Who puts Mister Blister out ? Who antagonizes the best friend a man ever had ? " " That 's a dog . Cats are n't man 's friends . They just put up with us . " Delia slammed her fist on the table . " That 's not true of Mister . He 's a very superior cat . " She leaned over to me . " You come out sometime when Margot is n't here . You 'll see what a true friend he is . And how smart . " Spike said thoughtfully , " He 's what you 'd call a two-woman cat . Mother Parry and Delia . You should see him follow them around the house when Margot is n't there . " " He 's good company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For Mother , being alone there all day . In fact I think they 're a lot alike . " She giggled . " They both hate the third floor and that ladder . Sometimes I wonder . . . " Her voice went off , then started again . " Sometimes I wonder whether it has anything to do with the girl who was killed . " Spike snorted , " Delia , do n't be silly . " She did n't even hear him . " I took him up there once . Carried him up the ladder . He snarled all the way . I set him down and he hunched there at the top , looking down . His tail swung back and forth , and the pupils of his eyes were black and big . He made me so nervous I could n't do the cleaning I 'd planned , so I carried him down again . You know , they say cats are  | psychic . There 's no reason why he should n't climb that ladder . He climbs everywhere else in the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spike 's hand . " Delia , stop it . I 'll go home tonight if you do n't stop talking like that . " Jim said sheepishly , " Me too . " They started closing the place . We walked down the street to the cars . We were all talking and shouting , except Margot and Bernard . They walked together . Bernard 's head was down . But even in my maudlin state I noticed how Margot walked . Like a queen . Like a model . Head held just right , hips swaying slightly , and her lovely legs moving smoothly . When Spike and I got into his car he put his arm around me . There was a twinge at first . Peter 's arm . Peter 's face beside me . But I soon forgot that . We drove along the highway slowly . We lost the other car . Halfway up the hill , which was not terrifying at all now , the car stopped . He kissed me . He kissed me several times . He said nice things . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this does n't mean a thing . I thought , Tomorrow I 'll be ashamed . So . . . I held him tighter to me . He said , " I 'll push him right out of your mind . " He told me my hair was beautiful . He told me he liked the way I squinted my eyes . I said , " Do n't say things to me tonight you 'll be sorry for tomorrow . " He laughed . " I never say anything tight that I would n't say sober . But I 'm going to be a cad about this tomorrow . In the bright light of day , when your head aches a bit , and your mouth tastes awful , I 'm going to say , Remember how you kissed me last night ? ' I will throw you into confusion . .. : " " Hey , let 's go in . " He started the car . " O.K. , sugar . " I laughed . " That 's what you called me this morning  --  sugar . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll have to find a new name for you . "  | " You could call me Sugar No. 16  --  " " Now , Jennie . No , it 's got to be new and different . " The other car was parked by the house , but when we went in there was n't a sound . We stood in the darkness for a little while before he went upstairs . I stumbled around getting into the bedroom . I did n't want to waken Mother Parry , but she was n't asleep . " Did you have a good time ? " " Oh yes . A fine time . A very fine time . " I turned on a lamp in the living room and went into the bathroom to undress . It took me a long time . I looked at myself in the mirror and thought I was a first-class hussy without looking like one . I washed my face very carefully , and realized suddenly that I 'd soaped and rinsed my neck five or six times . I had some trouble getting into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leg into the sleeve of the coat . I got that straightened out , and then I was astounded at the number of toothbrushes . I could n't decide which was mine . The thought came as an inspiration  --  I was the last one to go to bed  --  I 'd feel the bristles and use the one that was dry . There were several dry ones , so I finally picked the one with the green handle . I always was a sucker for green . I did a thorough job of brushing . Then I had fun with a bottle of red mouthwash . I gargled and swooped it around in my mouth . It was a shame to go to bed feeling as good as I did . I ought to wake everybody up and have some more fun . I opened the bathroom door . The house was quiet . I tiptoed down the hall to the living room . I could read awhile . But no , I 'd better get to bed . It was then I heard voices . I thought first , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I realized the voices were coming from Delia 's and Bernard 's bedroom . Oh , oh , my , my  --  how could I think of interrupting . I was convulsed . It was terribly funny . Me , a wide-awake and slightly tipsy spinster , thinking of interrupting a marital  --  a marital  --  well , whatever the word was . I  | must go quietly into my bedroom and not disturb them . Conjugal scene . That was it . That was the phrase I wanted . I crawled into bed . Mother Parry said , " Are you all right , dear ? " " Sure , I 'm fine . " " I wondered . I thought you might be sick . You were in the bathroom so long . " " No , I feel fine . " Yes , I felt fine , except my head was going around in circles , and the bed was moving . It swayed to a song we 'd been singing . Rhythmically . Bernard and Delia . That was sweet . The two of them in there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Last night he 'd been with Margot . I rolled over . People were lousy . People stunk  --  or was it stank ? Anyway , they did . I could hear the murmur of their voices even in here . I should n't have let Spike kiss me . I was in love with Peter . Even if he did n't love me ... . And the whole thing started up again . Drinks or no drinks , I had to come back to it . I was getting to be an authority on clocks striking . I knew and could catalogue all the sounds a house makes at night . What could Delia and Bernard be talking about ? Pretty soon their voices stopped . Water gurgled in the pipes . A train whistled off somewhere . I did n't even think about the ghost . I fell asleep and dreamed I was tweezing Spike 's heavy eyebrows .  | Sunday Morning IT SEEMED AS THOUGH I 'd hardly been asleep at all when Mother Parry wakened me . She was shaking my shoulder gently . " Jennie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He stuck his head in the bedroom door . " Come on , Jennie , let 's go for a walk . " " At this hour of the morning ? " " It 's practically noon . Best thing in the world for a hangover is a good brisk walk . " I got up . But I did n't like it . A good brisk walk to the bathroom and back to bed was the way I felt about it . When I was dressed I found him waiting for me with a cup of hot coffee . I drank it and felt good . " Why all this energy , Spike ? " " Listen , my pet , George is still in bed , Delia 's in bed , Bernard is taking Mother Parry to church , and Peg and Margot have gone off somewhere for a sun bath . Get it ? We can be alone . We can tramp the dunes and talk  --  without sixteen people butting in . " It was a beautiful morning . I was glad he 'd gotten me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the lake glittered blue to the horizon . Everything sparkled . We struck through a trail that would lead eventually to the lake . We sang as we walked along , and talked  --  nonsense mostly . I told him about my dream , and he laughed . " You know , Spike , maybe you should have your eyebrows tweezed . " " Good heavens , no . Why , they 're a part of my stock in trade . You know the word browbeat ' ? That 's what I use ' em for . I  | pull them down and glare  --  like this  --  and the poor minions under me work like hell . " " You said you were a bookkeeper . " " I am . " " But you do n't look like one . Bookkeepers are little and they have receding chins and receding hair  --  " " Now wait a minute . I bet you think they still sit on high stools , like in Dickens . " " Well , no . . . " " You 'll have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped and gestured . " Here is this tremendous room  --  hundreds  --  well , maybe , fifty machines  --  and me , sitting up at the top of the room , glaring  --  " " I bet . I bet you 're a good easy boss to work for . " " Nope . I 'm tough . Sometimes , " he laughed , " sometimes I think what fun it would be to walk up and down the aisles cracking a rawhide whip over their heads . It 's what we do , really , only in a more subtle way . " We 'd started up a dune . The sand slid under our feet . I had to stop to get my breath . " This is the hardest work I 've done in years . " He took hold of my hand and pulled . " You smoke too many cigarettes . " " That 's an idea . Let 's sit down and smoke a cigarette . " " O.K. When we get to the top of the hill . " So we clambered on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step . I thought I 'd collapse when we got to the top , but I did n't , I was so struck by the scene before us . The lake  --  blue and endless . Its far edges were muted , softened  --  there was no distinctness between sky and water . " What is that poem , Spike , something about silent upon a peak in Darien ' ? " There was no answer . I turned quickly  --  something about his quietness .. .  | His tanned skin was yellow , his jaw clenched . He was staring straight down . Margot and Peg were below us on a blanket stretched on the broad bare sand . Peg was sitting up , Margot lying stretched out , her head on Peg 's lap . Her hair was hanging loose , impossibly bright and beautiful in the sunlight . No wonder Peg 's hand was stroking it , playing with its silk heaviness . We could hear faintly the sound of Margot 's laughter . Suddenly Peg leaned down and kissed Margot 's forehead . " The bitch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm , pulled me around and down the hill we had just come up . When we got to the bottom he dropped down . " How about cigarettes now ? " But his hand was shaking so he could hardly light them . He took a deep drag before he spoke again . " What can you do , Jennie , about Margot ? Besides breaking her God-damned neck ? " I did n't say anything . His face was still that funny color . " As long as she picks on grown men like me and George and Bernard and nobody knows how many others  --  but Peg ... " He shook his head . " A kid . Jennie , she can ruin the kid 's whole life . " I tried to find out about Margot . I tried questioning him , but I did n't get very far . He admitted he could n't explain the thing she did to people  --  said he would n't even try . " Lord knows , I felt it . For a long time I loved her . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't go on from there . I tried another tack . I said I could n't see how a man like Bernard with a wife like Delia could ever look at another woman . He looked at me , almost amused . " Jennie , Jennie , what do you know about why men are or are n't faithful to their wives ? " " Well , I think " ? I guess I did sound pedantic ? " I think that if a man is unfaithful to his wife , or vice versa , they 're just trying to find something that 's lacking in their own marriage ,  | And if I were married and discovered that my husband was unfaithful I 'd try to find out what was wrong with me . " He laughed at that . Threw back his head and howled . " You would like hell . That 's easy to say when you 're sitting outside , looking on . " But it was from that little discussion that I got the story of Bernard . Spike was stretched out on the sand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again its normal brown . He talked on steadily , stopping to light cigarettes , or sometimes stopping as though he were thinking back . " Maybe you do think he 's a fool . Maybe he is . But if you 'd known him as I have you 'd be more lenient , I think . He was a senior when I was a freshman at the university . I was pledged to his fraternity . Good old Sigma Nu . He was president of the chapter , he was on the student council , he was assistant manager of the football team . He was a big man on campus . He had a job too . You could n't help admiring him  --  his tremendous energy  --  and his honesty . We got to be good friends . I had a little trouble that first year . You know  --  away from home for the first time , and thinking I was a man now and all that stuff . He straightened me out , like a Dutch uncle . He took me home with him for week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was teaching school in their small home town  --  and she was chipper  --  and fun . " We 'd sit up and talk , he and I , sometimes with a bottle . Women  --  jobs  --  women  --  school  --  women  --  over and over . I got to know his family fixation and I used to laugh at it . I got that phrase from the beginning course in psych I was taking . I 'd been raised in a family of seven kids and thousands of cousins and second cousins , and I could n't quite understand how he felt about children . He 'd say things like , When my boy 's ready to go to college , ' or , Now my daughter will . . . ' I said to him one night , My gosh , Bernard , how many are you going to have ? ' In all seriousness he said , Six , if I can afford them . '  | Well , you know , fellows do n't usually talk like that , do n't usually even think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's fine , but they do n't plan ahead for them when they 're seniors in college . Once in a while I could understand why he felt the way he did . There 'd always been just the two of them . He said , One Christmas when I was a kid we were invited to the principal 's home . Gees , it was wonderful . The great big tree and all the kids yelling and hollering and squealing . I cried when I had to leave . And Thanksgiving . Mother and I 'd always go out for dinner . I 'd see pictures in magazines of families sitting around a table and think how swell that would be . ' " I used to think he was pathetic and worry about his marrying some selfish little piece that could n't be bothered having a family . " He stopped , got out his pipe , and lit it . " We kept on being friends after he got out of school . It must have been about four years later that he met Delia . Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw she was a thoroughly nice person . She had a good job , but there was never any question of her working after they were married . No sir , she was entirely in accord with Bernard 's ideas . They built a house  --  a good big one  --  and just for a joke , and because I knew them so well , I bought them one of those fertility pillows that come from Guatemala . It turned out to be a damned poor joke . " He was quiet for a long time . He refilled his pipe , kept puffing on it to get it started . " One year . Two years . Three years  --  four  --  and Delia began to look pinched . Bernard 's booming laugh sounded a little forced . Well , sooner or later up popped a tramp of a stenographer . It was just one of those things . I imagine Delia knew about it , but she did n't say anything . There were a couple of others . And about that time I stuck my foot in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bernard 's extracurricular activities , but I asked her why they did n't adopt a child . She looked at  | me and smiled . It would n't do , Spike . You should know Bernard well enough to know that it 's his own child he wants ? not some other man 's . " " But , Spike , " I interrupted , " those tests , you know , that doctors give  --  " " You do n't think they passed up anything , do you ? " And as though he were quoting from a report , he said , " Nothing organically wrong . What are you going to do when the doctors say you should have married someone else ? That 's a hell of a lot of help . " " Yeah , I can see how it would be . " " Mother Parry had retired and had come to live with them . She loved Delia almost as much as she loved Bernard , and I often think it must have been harder for her to watch them being unhappy than it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Delia get a job . And that seemed to help . I mean , she was n't sitting around feeling sorry for herself and Bernard . She perked up , and it was n't long until they both seemed to find themselves . As though they 'd finally adjusted themselves to the situation and were making the best of it . " He was sitting up , one hand picking up sand , dropping it . He had good hands  --  square fingers , slightly on the bony side . " So I  --  Mr. Fix-it , you know  --  had to drop Margot into the group . Me  --  I 'm Bernard 's best friend , so I hand him a small viper on a silver platter to play with . Not that they were anything but friends at first . At least that 's what I think . Anyway , she was busy with me at the time . When our engagement fell through we 'd still be invited to their house , but at different times . She had some guy named Jerry at her heels for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know when she started messing with Bernard . And the hell of it is , he 's such a simple soul . " Sand dribbled through his fingers . " I ought to do something . " He laughed bitterly . " The only thing I can think of is to throw another sucker to her . Get her mind off Bernard . Now that she 's lost George ... "  | I jumped . " How do you know she 's lost George ? " " Listen , Jennie , when you 've known anyone as long as I 've known Margot you get to know the signs . I do n't know what happened , but George is through . It 's too bad , because she thought he would marry her . It 's strange , is n't it  --  a girl as beautiful as she is , with a phobia as bad as an old maid 's about marriage , and not able to get married ? " " It 's not so strange , maybe . I mean , she gets them at first , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They discover what  --  Oh hell , I 'm talking too much . " I realized suddenly that the sun was gone and it was getting chilly . " Spike , look , do you suppose it 's going to rain ? " He turned his face up to the sky , pointed to the top of the dune . Wisps of fog were sliding over it . " Let 's walk up and see the lake . " So we climbed again . Margot and Peg were gone . The lake was n't blue now . All a shifting soft grayness . You could hardly see the line of the shore . I shivered . He put his arm around me . His woolen shirt was warm . " Want to kiss me , Jennie , in the cold light of day , strictly sober ? " I nodded my head , and he kissed me softly , on my cheek and on my mouth . The ghost of Peter was almost gone . You could feel the dampness . He said , " Your hair is wet . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started back . " I ca n't have you getting pneumonia  --  or even one of those sniffling head colds . " " I 'm more likely to die of starvation on the way back . " " Me too . We should be just in time for dinner . " Before we got to the trail leading up to the house the fog was thick . I had hold of Spike 's hand . " We might have got lost in it , Spike . " " Yeah , except that sooner or later we 'd have bumped into somebody 's house . "  | Mister Blister met us and walked beside us to the top of the hill . His long sandy-colored fur was drooping wet . But he did n't try to come into the house . He walked off under the bushes as Spike opened the door for me . Spike chuckled . " He knows when he 's not wanted . " There was the smell of meat roasting , and the sound of the piano . Sunday Afternoon REMEMBER , several years back , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were stories about how it was n't allowed to be played because of the number of suicides that resulted . I heard it once  --  I mean , I heard part of it . I asked the man in a record store to play it for me , then made him take it off . This Sunday afternoon reminded me of at least the title of that song . Gloom pressing down on us so heavy that it was an effort to smile . I think all of us wanted to go home , but we stayed . The plans were to leave Monday morning , and no one had the courage to say , " Come on , let 's go . " Probably it would have been better if we had . Or maybe not . When Spike and I came in from our walk Mother Parry and Peg and Bernard were doing their best to get dinner on the table . I pitched in and Spike bustled around getting in everyone 's way . Delia was in bed . " She 's not feeling well , " Mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hung over from last night . You should n't have let her drink so much . She ca n't drink worth a darn . "  | I said , " Where 's George  --  and Margot ? " Peg said , " Margot 's getting dressed ; she has to call on some people she knows this afternoon . And George . . . " She whispered , " He says he has one of his headaches , but if you ask me , I think he 's suffering from something entirely different . " " What do you mean , Peg ? " " Well " ? and she smiled ? " Margot told me this morning ... " She hesitated an instant . " I really should n't be telling this because Margot told me in confidence . " She slightly emphasized the " me , " she stroked the words " in confidence , " then rushed on , " But I know you wo n't say anything . They 've broken off . Definitely . " " Is that right . " She did n't notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 's too dopey for her . " " Dopey ? I thought you liked George . " " Oh , I do  --  in a way . But Margot 's so superior . " I went out to the kitchen and slapped the mashed potatoes into a bowl . Margot came down just as we got the food on the table . She was wearing a black wool dress , so severely plain that it was almost like a uniform . Her hair gleamed above it . No rouge , very little lipstick . Sheer black stockings , high-heeled pumps with huge glittering square buckles . Peg was standing beside me . I heard her gasp . She said , " Oh , Margot , how stunning you look . Here  --  come over and sit beside me . " I could n't look at Spike . I was afraid to , afraid that I 'd catch him looking at her , admiring her . " May I borrow your car this afternoon , Spike ? I promised to stop at the McDonalds ' . " " Yeah . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong with it . " " You might drive me over . " " I might , but I 'm not going to . " I was so relieved I looked over at him and grinned . " Nice of you . " She was loading her plate .  | " You 're lucky to get the car . Pass the salt , will you , Jim ? " Mother Parry did a lot of talking during that meal . Jim helped out . George sat there drinking coffee . I do n't think Bernard said two words during the whole meal . Margot and Peg carried on a conversation of their own . When we were eating dessert Bernard asked Mother Parry , " Shall I take something in to Delia ? " " No , I 'll fix her some soup later . " Margot asked brightly , " How is Delia ? " Nobody answered . She repeated , " How is Delia  --  Mother Parry ? " " All right , Margot . Wo n't you have another small piece of pie , Spike ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Margot looked amused . " I 'd better dash along . " Her black hat was as severe as her dress . " Wait a minute , Margot , I 'll go out to the car with you . " Peg scrambled from the table . When she came back she sat down . " I think I 'll smoke a cigarette . Did n't Margot look wonderful ? " Her eyes were shining . " Just like what you imagine a person like she is should look like . " Spike said , disgusted , " Peg ! What a sentence . What do you mean ? " " Oh " ? she waved the cigarette ? " exciting people , cocktail parties , fascinating conversation , handsome men ... " " In other words , a story in Cosmopolitan magazine . " " You make me tired , Spike . You have no imagination  --  no finesse  --  " " Yeah . How about getting these dishes out of the way ? " As soon as we 'd finished them Bernard got into boots and a heavy jacket . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Spike groaned , " Bernard , if that 's a bid for help you 're out of luck . I 'm going to relax this afternoon . " " I do n't want any help . " His boots were heavy on the bare floor of the hall . We heard the outer door slam .  | " Come on , Jennie , let 's have a game of double solitaire . " George was in a corner of the living room . He had a drawing pad and pencil . Jim was reading . Peg said plaintively , " What will I do ? Are you all going to sit around and not do anything with me ? Jim , do n't read . Play cribbage with me . " " Cribbage with you ! You ca n't even add . " " Yes , I can . I 'll use my fingers . I 'll never learn if you do n't play with me . " " O.K. , O.K. , go get the board . " I could hear Mother Parry at the bedroom window . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you poor thing . All wet and bedraggled . Come on in and we 'll get you dried  --  and brushed . " She came into the living room carrying him in a turkish towel , another towel slung over her shoulder . " Well , Mister . " Jim was laughing . " If you are n't a sight . " Mother Parry sat down on the couch . " The poor thing  --  out in all that wet . " She put him on the one towel on her lap and started rubbing him with the other . It was then , I think , that the gloom started creeping over me . The room was so  --  so static . George might have been somewhere else . Every so often Jim would yell at Peg , " Hey , you ca n't do that . " " Listen , dope , eight and seven is fifteen . " Spike and I played one game after another of solitaire . He beat me consistently because I could n't keep my mind on the cards . Mother Parry crooned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Bernard 's ax outside . At the windows was the grayness of fog . " There , he looks better now , does n't he ? " You 'd have thought he knew what she said , the way he preened and switched his tail back and forth . He walked around the room , stopped beside each of us to be patted . Even George roused from his drawing pad and leaned down to stroke him . I got to wondering about George . It was possible that he regretted his summary dismissal of Margot . That would explain the way he was acting . Regret . Remorse .  | " I think I 'll go see how Delia 's feeling . " Mother Parry hummed softly as she walked out . I fitted the words to the tune : " Long , long , you 'll wait my coming  --  at the little cottage door . . . . " She was back in about five minutes , smiling . " I 've persuaded her to come out . I think it will do her good to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how walking into this particular group would do anyone any good . I was surprised when I saw her . Deep circles under her eyes . She walked as though she 'd been ill for a long time , as though she were terribly weak . She had a brilliant blue wool bathrobe on , and it made her look ghastly pale . Spike jumped up . " Delia , maybe you should n't have got up . " She smiled . " I 'm all right , Spike . It was that fifteenth drink that laid me low . " Peg said callously , " You ought to know better , Delia . Someday maybe you 'll learn . " " Maybe I will  --  someday . " Spike was unfolding the bright afghan . " And someday maybe you 'll grow up , Peg , and know when and when not to be rude . At least I hope you will . I 'm beginning to think it 's a vain hope . " " Oh , shut up . You should talk about being rude . You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting on the end of the long couch . " Put your head on my lap , dear . Maybe I can rub some of the ache out of it . " She lay down . Spike put the afghan over her . He squatted down beside the couch , looked into her face . His voice was tender . " Have you had anything at all to eat , Delia ? " " Tomato juice . Mother gave me some this morning . " " Milk is very good . It settles the stomach . I could heat you up a glass of milk . " " I 'm afraid I could n't keep it down . I 'll be all right , Spike . Do n't worry about me . " I loved the way he patted her hand . " Sure you will . "  | I could see her take hold of his hand , tightly . Then she let go of it , and he came back to our game . He passed up three plays and I beat him that time . Small triumph , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised her head . " Do n't tell me Bernard 's really chopping that wood ? I 've been at him for weeks  --  " " Yeah , the lug . On a day like today when no normal person would stick his nose outside . " " Yes , but at least we 'll have wood for the  --  " Her voice stopped . Peg clapped her hands . " Oh , let 's have a fire in the fireplace tonight . Like Friday night . When I went to bed . I missed it , so we should have one tonight . And Margot can tell stories . Oh , Delia , if you only felt well enough to make some of that good fudge . " Spike picked up the cards and started shuffling them . " I think it 'd be a good idea if everybody went to bed early tonight . Monday morning has a way of sneaking up on you . And tomorrow we all have a hard day at the office . " " Oh heck . " Peg 's voice was petulant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Put it the other way around , kid , and you 'll be approximately right . The philosophy of week ends is that you raise hell Friday and Saturday night and tuck yourself in early Sunday . " Sunday ! I never have liked Sunday . It 's all right up until about four o'clock . And then I start being depressed . Sunday papers on the living-room floor . People getting up groggy from after-dinner naps . Nothing to do . The office comes back at you about that time . You begin thinking about the things you left unsettled at the office . There 's all that filing to get done . And Perkins 'll probably raise hell about the mistake that was made in the Billings Company contract . My blue dress is dirty . The green one needs pressing . I could wear my suit , but I have n't a clean blouse to my name . Have to wear that darn brown .  | Then you start wishing someone would call and suggest doing something . Telephones are more obnoxious in their quietness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always laughed at my phobia . He 'd take me to tea . There was a place on the south side in an old house with high ceilings and a fireplace . They served real English teas  --  muffins and sandwiches . We 'd go there , and then drive around , and end up somewhere for dinner where there was music . Dinner music  --  Strauss waltzes and Lehar and Victor Herbert . He 'd said that in the summer we 'd go on picnics . All summer long , when he was gone from me , I 'd think what it would be like if he were still around , and we 'd be going picnicking . I 'd go to the movies , all by myself , at three o'clock , trying to do away with four o'clock and five o'clock . I 'd stop in at a pay telephone afterward and call all the women I knew to get up a bridge game . Anything to keep from sitting in my apartment alone . Spike shoved the cards into a heap . " Jennie , why did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red on red , black on black , and you do n't seem to realize that queens follow jacks , and sixes follow fives . " I looked up at him . " I 'm sorry , Spike . " He put his hand over mine . " I 'm the one that 's sorry . Excuse me for living . Maybe Peg is right . " I glanced quickly around the room , leaned over the table , and kissed him lightly . He grinned . " Then all is forgiven ? " " Everything 's copacetic . Strictly . " " Only " ? he was whispering ? " do n't go kissing me like that in front of Mister Blister . It 's dangerous . " " Yes , I 've heard that he 's quite a chaperon . " " He 's got long sharp claws and he uses them  --  on the ankle . " We put the table back out of the way and sat beside each other on the small couch . Spike got two straight chairs for us to put our feet on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm thinking of a word that rhymes with work . "  | Delia 's voice was faint . She did n't open her eyes . " Is it what you do when you 're supposed to do something and do n't ? " No , it is not shirk . ' " Jim asked , " Is it a small sword ? " " No , it is not dirk . ' " Peg said to Jim , " All right , let 's quit . I 'm bored with this . " He yelled , " You 're bored ! I like that . You 're bored ! What do you suppose I 've been all along ? I sure would like to talk to the teacher that was supposed to teach you arithmetic . Sitting there tapping your fingers every time you have to add more than two and two . " He started putting the cribbage board , the pegs , the cards away . Peg got up , came over , and sat down on the floor near us . " Is it what burglars and murderers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is not lurk . ' " Jim yawned . " Is it a word applied to a nationality ? " " No , it is not Turk . ' " It was a silly , valiant attempt . But it did n't do any good . Even with Peg coaxing , " Come on , everybody , come on . It 's no fun unless everybody plays . George , put away that silly pad and play with us . " Even with Delia stirring herself to question . Even with Mother Parry putting in ridiculous little puns . It fell flat . Peg suggested that we play a third of a ghost , and tried to start it , but nobody cared . She fell asleep . She grabbed a pillow , put her head on it , and fell sound asleep . I half shut my eyes . Spike had his arm around me , my head was on his shoulder . I got to watching Mother Parry . Her small hands stroked Delia 's forehead endlessly . She did n't try to talk any more . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above the floor . Delia . What had happened to Delia ? The ax beat on steadily . It would stop for a while and then start up again . It was a wonder he did n't get tired . Jim stood up . " Anybody else want a can of beer ? " " Fix me a drink , will you , Jim ? " It was George . I looked over  | at him . He was studying the sheets of drawing paper , and he started tearing them up , slowly , carefully . I said , " George  --  George , do n't do that . I wanted to see what you 'd been drawing . " " Nothing worth looking at . " He walked over to the window , Mister Blister at his heels . " Still foggy . " He turned back to us . " You know , they say on days like this they have to hide ropes and guns from Germans to keep them from killing themselves . I begin to be aware of that one-eighth German ancestry of mine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so quietly . " I 'd be more likely to commit suicide on a sunshiny day . " I could feel the rumble of Spike 's voice . " If anyone could imagine your ever committing suicide , " Jim was back in the room , with beer for himself , beer and ale for George . " I expect most people seriously consider suicide at one time or another . " Spike was emphatic . " Not me . I 'm too curious . If I live to be a hundred I 'll still be damned mad at having to leave . " George was smiling . " Our good old extrovert . " " Do n't start throwing those words around , George . Always starts an argument . Introvert  --  extrovert  --  who the hell knows which is which ? Or , I might add , cares . " Delia 's voice was stronger . " It 's being needed that 's important . " I do n't think any of us realized what she meant at first . " I can imagine , I can see myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no person left who cares whether I 'm sick or tired or lonely . That 's it . " She opened her eyes . " That 's the thing that makes suicide real to me . Loneliness . Maybe that 's why I said a sunny day . Because that 's when it 's awful to be alone . " George said , " But you could never be alone , Delia . Never . You 're strong yourself , so there will always be people who will lean on you . "  | She shut her eyes again . " I hope you 're right , George , I hope you 're right . People have always thrown that at me . Like Jennie , when she read my palm a long time ago when we first met , and she said I was like a cat : no matter what happened to me , I 'd always land on my feet . " She opened her eyes , looked around the room until she found me . " You 'd be surprised , Jennie , how often that remark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it badly . " I did n't know what to say . My voice sounded falsely cheerful to me . " If it 's in your palm , darling , it 's truer than true . I never miss . " " That 's good . " The words were almost whispered . Jim 's beer gurgled as he refilled his glass . " Seems silly to hear Delia talking about needing courage . The gal I always run to when I 'm in trouble . You should n't talk like that , Delia , you 'll make me think you 're fallible . " She had taken one of Mother Parry 's hands and was holding it . " There 's a remark of Lincoln 's that 's me . Even if you guys " ? the attempted joviality was forced ? " even if you guys do n't see it in me . " " What 's that , Delia ? " " Something he said  --  something like this : I have need of friends  --  for I 've a queer , anxious heart .... ' " George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He repeated tonelessly , " ' A queer , anxious heart : " The sound of the ax seemed louder . It pounded through the room . Jim stirred . " Is he chopping down the whole forest out there ? " Mother Parry said , " There was a quite a pile of logs . Our whole winter 's supply for the fireplace . " Delia turned her face away from us . Toward Mother Parry , whose wrinkled hand was patting her thin shoulder . Three pats to one stroke of the ax . I watched her breathlessly , waiting for her to break the rhythm .  | Jim 's glass banged as he set it down . " Does anyone mind if I play the piano ? " " The millennium . The millennium is here . There 's probably a million dollars for each of us in baskets outside the door . " Jim stared at Spike . " What are you talking about ? " " Listen , fellow , when you ask permission to play the piano , that 's the millennium . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turning . I 'm listening for Gabriel 's horn . " " Nuts . Do you mind , Delia ? I wo n't if it will bother you . " " Not at all , Jim . I wish you would . " I did too . It was the one thing that might take the leadenness out of the room . At least it would kill the sound of the pounding ax . I turned from the sight of Mother Parry 's wrinkled hand with its rhythmic patting , and watched Jim walk over to the piano . Usually good music puts me in a coma . It 's queer . I 'm not conscious of what 's going on around me and I 'm not thinking . When Jim first started playing I did just the opposite . As though a button had been pushed and the wheels in my head had been set in motion . It was about Delia . Here I 'd been wondering what was wrong with her , and it was as plain as the nose on your face . Bernard was leaving Delia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was one of those things you could n't take by yourself . I grabbed hold of Spike 's arm . I whispered , " Spike , Spike . " He leaned his head down . " Spike , you do n't suppose Bernard is leaving Delia for Margot ? " Maybe he 'd say no , maybe he 'd tell me I was being silly . He did n't look at me . He whispered back , " That 's how I 've figured it . " " Oh , my God . " " Yeah . " He could n't do it . He 'd have to be stopped . He did n't realize what Margot was like ; someone must tell him . I knew that was silly even as I was thinking it . What would happen to Mother Parry ? She and Margot got  | along about as well as Mister Blister and Margot . There 'd be no place for her in Margot 's house . Oh , the fool . The crazy asinine fool . The music started trickling through to me . Jim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and over again . It was soft at first . It began to grow . The rhythm beat , it pounded . He added chords . His body was moving to it . And I could feel it catch hold of Spike . His hand was beating on the arm of the couch . The music was so loud it came pouring at you from all sides of the room . Stronger , stronger , heavier , heavier . It was a part of you . Your whole body was taken by it . My hands were clenched . I thought , I ca n't stand it  --  I ca n't stand another instant of it . Beating at me . Tearing at me . I had n't realized I was swaying until I felt Spike 's hand hurting my shoulder , holding me still . It was Delia who screamed , " Jim , Jim  --  stop ! " She was sitting up , her hands over her face . Jim dropped his hands onto the keys . His face shone with perspiration . The loud discords that came from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward . " Good Lord , Jim , that was terrific . " Jim looked dazed . Delia laughed . " Horrible , horrible music . How could you play such ghastly music ? " He came away from the piano . He hunted around on the table for a cigarette . George asked , " What was it , Jim ? " " I do n't know . I just got started . Delia , I 'm sorry . I knew I should n't have played . " " It 's that I 'm nervous , Jim , I guess . I should apologize to you for spoiling it . " I moved away from Spike 's arm . " Delia is right , Jim , it was awful . She yelled a minute before I 'd have had to . " Spike did n't say anything . I looked at him . His face was the funny yellow color again .  | Peg was sitting up on the floor , her hands around her knees . " Why do n't you play the Blue Danube ' for us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeah . " And he was laughing so he could hardly talk . " Yeah , the Blue Danube ' would be fine . Give us a little sweetness and light  --  to take the taste of death and destruction out of our souls . " We could n't see anything to laugh at . We did n't know what he was talking about . He got up from beside me and went to the other side of the room . He scooped Mister Blister up from a chair beside the piano and sat down . Mister curled up on his lap . " Go ahead , Jim , give us the Blue Danube ' ? and the Merry Widow ' ? and finish off with Love Sends a Little Gift of Roses . ' " I felt very much alone . I shivered . It was cold with his arm not around me , with the warmth of his body gone . I looked at him , but he was watching Jim 's fingers on the keys of the piano . Sunday Night I DO N'T LIKE to remember that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me . Delia went to her bedroom . We did n't attempt to have a regular supper . We " pieced . " That meant everyone went out to the kitchen and ate whatever he wanted . Bernard came in and spent most of the evening fixing things  --  the faucet in the bathroom , the juicer on the Mixmaster , the wire on the electric toaster . Margot got back about seven , went right upstairs , changed to a skirt and sweater , then came down and regaled us with the story of her afternoon . Peg followed her around like a puppy . If Margot sat on the couch Peg was beside her . If  | Margot sat on a chair Peg was on the floor at her feet . George went to bed . About eight-thirty Mother Parry asked Spike to drive to town for sleeping tablets . He said , " Come on , Jennie . " When I stepped outside I took a deep breath of the cool , wet air . We did n't talk much . We rolled the windows of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house . I said , " Spike , morning ca n't come too quickly for me . " " Nor me . " He added glumly , " That solves it for you and me and Jim  --  but how about the others ? " " I ca n't talk about it . I do n't even want to think about it . Let 's try to put it out of our minds . " We had a chocolate soda in the drugstore , and Spike bought me a key ring with a rabbit 's foot on it . " To remember me by , " he said . I held the silly thing in my hand and looked at him . " I do n't need anything to remind me of you . " " Just until Monday evening . I ca n't run the risk of your forgetting me before then . " He got into the car beside me , handed me a small notebook . " Open that up , Jennie , to the S page , write your address and telephone number . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Careful , now , so that I can read it . " When I 'd finished he put it back in his pocket . " Do n't you think it would be fun , Miss Simpson , to do something exciting Monday evening like  --  well , say , taking in a movie together ? " " How about Tuesday ? " " Oh , so you 're going to play hard to get ? I suppose you 're so dated up  --  " I laughed . " Monday . That 's tomorrow . In the evening I want to have my hair washed . I 'm going to fix my fingernails and get to bed early . Then I 'll be in fit condition to take in a movie with you Tuesday . " " Well , O.K. , if that 's the way it is . Can I call you at your office ? Tomorrow afternoon , say ? I think by that time I 'll be hungering for the sound of your voice . "  | " That sounds like a line . And I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house and took me into his arms . " I mean it , Jennie . I mean it . " I was never going to believe any man again . I believed him . While he was kissing me I said , " Spike , could n't we go now ? Could n't we go in and get our things and leave ? " It seemed terribly important that we not go back into that house to stay . I wanted to keep the feeling I had outside there with him . It would be spoiled if we went back  --  it would be touched by all of that in there . " I do n't see how we can , Jennie . I do n't think " ? he hesitated ? " I do n't think we should . " " All right . If you think we should n't . " At the door he kissed me again . " Say good night to me here , Jennie . This . . . is for good night . . . and this . . . is for tomorrow morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He gave Mother Parry the sleeping tablets and went right upstairs . Bernard and Peg and Margot were in the living room . I went into Delia 's room with Mother Parry . We gave her two of the tablets . I kissed her good night . I walked through the living room  --  they called good night ? and I started undressing . I could hear Peg . " Come on , Margot , let 's go up . " " You run along , angel . I 'll be along in a minute . " " But you 'll stop in and say good night to me ? " Margot laughed indulgently . " Yes , I 'll stop in . " I listened . I not only listened , I stood beside the crack of the door so that I could hear better . Their voices were low , but I got part of it . Margot was saying she wanted to talk to him . Bernard replied , " But everything 's settled , Margot . " " Not quite , Bernard , " and words that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll wait until Mother 's asleep . " Apparently she was going upstairs for a while and then come  | clown , and they were going out in the car . She went up before Mother Parry came from Delia . Bernard said , " I 'll sleep out here , Mother , on the couch . " " I guess you 'd better . She 's sleeping soundly now and I would n't want her to be wakened . Shall I get covers for you ? " " No , never mind . Go on to bed . I 'm going to read before I turn in . " She came in pretty soon in the blue flannelette robe and nightgown . " Mother Parry , could I have one of those sleeping pills ? " " Of course , Jennie . " " I 'll put it here on the table with a glass of water . I may not need it . " " You 'd better take it , Jennie . It wo n't hurt you , and you have n't had much sleep this week end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blister in and turned out the light . The lamp in the living room made a crack of light around the door . I did n't go to sleep right away . Mother Parry 's breath was even . After a time the door opened softly and Bernard said , " Mother , Mother . " She did n't answer . A few minutes later I heard the car starting outside . I do n't like to take sleeping tablets . They make me dream horrible things , and usually the next day I 'm dopey and drugged . Going to sleep with the thought of Bernard and Margot off in the car did n't help any . Margot slid in out of my dreams . Margot  --  all mixed up with that poem of Swinburne 's . Spike came into them . His eyebrows again . He had a whip and he was beating Margot and she was laughing at him . I was trying to get to him , but Peter had hold of my arms . He would n't let go of me . Piano music was pounding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned over . The small clock said one-thirty . I got to thinking about the dream . It was almost  | too symbolical to be true . Peter holding me , keeping me from Spike . But it was n't going to be that way . I was going to forget him . And forgetting him brought him back . " I 'm not going to lie here and think about him . I 'm not going to . " So I did . So I went over all the old ground . Would I never be free of him ? Would he come between me and Spike always ? I turned again . What if I 'd lose Spike too ? Maybe he 'd love me awhile and go away . .. . I threw off one of the covers , and as I put my head back on the pillow I heard it . Footsteps . Footsteps along the hall upstairs . My whole body was straining , listening . I stopped breathing , held my breath until my head throbbed to hear the thing I did n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me there was a silence after the footsteps . For her climbing . For her climbing . But there would n't be a thump  --  because someone had gone to the bathroom and was now in bed . Someone was now .. . It was when the dull thud came that I bit my lip . Bit my lip to keep from screaming , dug my nails into my hands . Not to waken Mother Parry  --  not to waken anyone  --  not to let them know .... I was shaking . It was n't true . It could n't be true . I did n't believe in ghosts . There were n't such things . And yet I 'd heard . I 'd heard the footsteps  --  light and dainty and slow . I 'd heard the heavy drop of a body ... . I buried my face in the pillow . Pure , unreasoning terror . Not a sound in the house  --  not a sound but the ticking of the clock . I finally settled down . My heart was n't pounding so , the shaking had stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overwrought imagination . I talked myself out of it and put my hands inside my pajamas next to my stomach to warm them .  | I fell asleep , thinking how I would tell Spike about it Tuesday , and we could laugh at it together . I was out of bed , standing on the floor in my bare feet , listening to the screams . I started after Mother Parry . I stumbled over Mister Blister . It was n't light yet , and I was n't thinking . A sliver on the stairs tore at my foot , but the screams pulled me up the stairs . They had to be stopped . My ears could n't stand it . The upper hallway was gray in the early morning light . It was Peg who was screaming . I saw Spike and George and Jim  --  looking down at the floor . Her legs were sprawled . I remember thinking how she would hate having her legs spread out like that  --  I wanted to go over and straighten them . Her head lolled over to one side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over my head . A long uneven scratch ran down the whiteness of her cheek . There were words now to Peg 's screams : " I fell over her . I stumbled over her head and fell on her . " She started to sob ? great tearing sobs that shook her body . She kept repeating , " I fell on her . I fell on her . " I heard Mother Parry say , " Jim ! " Without a word he went over , picked up Peg , and carried her into her room . Mother Parry scurried by me down the stairs . She came back up and went into the bedroom . Jim came out . He walked over , knelt down beside Margot . " She 's dead . " He turned her head . I heard myself say , " Her legs , Jim , her legs , " and he straightened them out . I had n't seen Bernard until then . He was sitting on a stool over by the window at the end of the hall . His arms were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he was crying . I could see his shoulders shaking . Delia 's voice came up from downstairs . " What 's happened ? What is wrong ? " Her footsteps , slowly , as though she were taking one step at a time , like a child .  | Spike rushed forward . " Do n't let her come up here . " He looked funny . His hair was mussed and he had on only his pajama pants . " Jennie , stop her ! " But she was already at the top of the stairs . She was standing beside me . I was ready to grab her . I thought she might faint . But she did n't . Her voice was clear . " Is she dead ? " Spike said , " Yes , Delia . She must have fallen down the ladder . " She looked around at us all . " I 'm glad . " She was smiling . k " Maybe there 's justice after all . " She walked over to the body , looked down , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hope you 're roasting in hell , Margot . Bad cess to you , my dear . " Spike exclaimed , " My Lord , she 's out of her head ! " " I never was saner . " We could still hear Peg 's sobs . " I fell over her , Mother Parry . She was cold . My hands touched her , and she was cold . I stepped on her face . Oh , Mother Parry , I stepped on her face . " " There , there , child . Take this , dear , take this , and lie still , darling . " I did n't even realize that it was I who was screaming until I felt Spike shaking me and shouting , " Jennie , Jennie , stop it . " He put his arms around me . " I heard her fall , Spike . I heard it . I thought it was the ghost . She was climbing the ladder and I heard her . I heard her fall . I thought it was the ghost . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maybe she was alive , Spike . Maybe if I had n't been afraid  --  if I 'd got up , we could have done something . " " No , darling , no . " Blessed to have his arms around me . I had n't realized I was cold until I felt the warmth of his body . I cried against him . Ile stroked my hair and held me tight . Delia asked sharply , " What must we do ? " George spoke for the first time . " Ca n't we take her into one of the rooms ? "  | Jim said , " I do n't know that we should . Do n't we have to leave  --  I mean  --  well , it will have to be reported .... " George 's voice was strained . " If we could just pick her up off the floor . " We looked at each other . Nobody knew what to do . Spike said , " We 'll have to find a telephone and call someone . A doctor ? " Jim replied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know who the coroner is ? " She passed her hand over her forehead . " Heavens , no . " Jim looked to the window . " Would Bernard know ? " All of us were trying to ignore Bernard . She hesitated an instant . " I do n't think so . " Jim said , " Come on , Spike , let 's get some clothes on and go down the hill . There 's a phone at the Hallowells ' . " George spoke up quickly . " I 'll go with you , Jim . " Mother Parry came out of Peg 's room . Delia said , " Mother , George and Jim are going to telephone . " " That 's good . " She looked up at the ladder . " I always said that was dangerous  --  that sooner or later someone would get hurt . You 'd better all get some clothes on . I 'll make a pot of coffee . " She was dressed , but her hair was hanging . Apparently the screaming had started just as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my ear . " The rest of us go to pieces , but old people can always take it . A pot of coffee . Maybe it 's because they 've seen death so often that they can face it better than we can . " Mother Parry led Delia down the stairs . George and Jim had already started . " She 's still lovely , is n't she , Spike ? " " Yes . Better now because you know she 's cold and hard . Before , you thought there must be some softness somewhere . But there was n't . Come on , Jennie , let 's go down . " " How about Bernard ? We ca n't leave him up here . " " No , I suppose not . "  | " You go on down . Let me talk to him , Spike . " " O.K. " I walked over to Bernard . I knelt beside him and put my arm across his shoulders . He raised his head to me . " Jennie . Oh , it 's Jennie . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me ? " " She 's dead , is n't she , Jennie ? Margot 's dead ? " " Yes , Bernard . " He took a deep breath , spoke carefully . " She was climbing the ladder to her room , and fell . It was my fault because I 'd had her out . Otherwise she 'd have been in bed . She 'd have been in bed and she would n't have been climbing the ladder in the dark . I should have come in with her , but I did n't . I let her out of the car and drove to that joint and drank . She did n't have the flashlight . She had to climb in the dark . " He was n't crying now . " My fault . " " No , Bernard , you must n't think that . Things happen ; they 're not anyone 's fault . You must n't . You ca n't blame yourself . Come downstairs with me . We 'll have a drink and some hot coffee . " He got up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against me . We started to the stairway , but he stopped . He led me over to Margot . I had to look at her again . I tried to avoid the staring eyes . Her hands were clenched . I thought , Someone should have unclenched them . I could n't keep from feeling that any minute she 'd speak . I expected to hear her laugh  --  and ridicule us  --  expected her to sit up and laugh in our faces and say , " You goons . I did give you a scare , did n't I ? " But the dread silence held . Bernard 's arm was gone from my shoulders . Both of his hands were over his face . An ugly sob caught in his throat . I heard the words  --  clear , distinct , torturing words : " My son ... my son . . . "  | Monday Morning I WAS SO COLD . No one had turned the lamps on downstairs . Ugly grayness of morning in the room . I put on my suit and sweater and jacket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with gooseflesh . Spike walked around the room . His pajama pants hung loose and baggy . He 'd found a pair of bedroom slippers of Bernard 's that were much too big for him . They slopped over the floor as he walked . He was wearing a shirt of Bernard 's and an old sweater . The elbows were out of the sweater . I guess he did n't want to go upstairs to get his own clothes . Bernard was sitting over in the corner . He still wore his pajamas , but Delia had come out of their bedroom , fully dressed , carrying his robe . She had put him into it . And it was just that . She made him stand up , she put his arms into it , set him down , and wrapped the robe around his knees . When she leaned over and kissed his forehead he moved . He put his arms around her , held her for an instant . She walked away from him to the kitchen , and he settled back into the apathy that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ active , never still for an instant . Spike walked back and forth , back and forth . It made me nervous , but I did n't want to ask him to stop . I kept thinking the craziest things  --  about having my hair done , and whether we 'd have our date tomorrow night as we 'd planned . " Spike , Spike . " It was Mother Parry calling . " Will you come carry this in for me ? " A tray with the electric coffee maker and cups . He set it down on the table .  | Coffee never tasted so good . It was burning hot , it was strong . It took the shivers away . Jim and George came in , their faces red . Jim rubbed his hands . " It 's colder than Billy-be-damned outside . " " Here , have a cup of coffee . " Mother Parry handed the steaming cups to them . Delia was beside Bernard , sitting on a stool . " Did you get a doctor ? " " We called  --  " Jim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good . We called a Dr. Medved , who lives out here . " Mother Parry said , " Oh yes , he 's from Chicago . They live in that modernistic house east of here . His wife owns a horse . She rides up and down the beach . " Delia was impatient . " Mother ! " " We told him what had happened and he said he 'd come over , although there probably was n't anything he could do . But he said he 'd call the sheriff for us . " It was Delia 's cup that fell . " Sheriff ? " " Oh , Delia , coffee on that rug . " Mother Parry rushed over ; the cup had n't broken . She picked up the small Persian rug . " Oh dear , it will be stained . " Delia paid no attention . " Sheriff , Jim ? " " Yes , Delia , he has to be called . " " But why ? She just fell down the ladder . " " Honey , any time a death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result of a legitimate illness  --  I mean , if you 've not been under a doctor 's care , the sheriff and the coroner have to be notified . " " Coroner . " It was an awful , strained whisper . " It 's merely a matter of form . For instance if  --  well , if Jennie here had died of a heart attack in the night , any doctor we 'd call would have to notify the coroner . They have to make out reports and things . " " You mean they 'll come here and look at her and ask us questions ? " " They 'll want to know what happened . "  | Delia 's hand reached quickly to Bernard 's as he started to talk . " I 'll tell them it was my fault , that I had her out in the car and that she had to climb the ladder in the dark . " Mother Parry snapped , tartly , " Nonsense , you 'll do nothing of the kind . We 're at fault , yes , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's all the fault there is to it . " Jim 's voice was practical . " I do n't think we need to tell them anything . Seems to me the facts speak for themselves . She was climbing the ladder and she fell . " " It 's strange , is n't it ? " George was standing by the window . It was light , now , outside , but the sun was n't shining . His face looked haggard , unshaven . " That Margot , as agile as a cat , should die like this . I 've never known anyone as sure-footed as she was . I lost five dollars to her once , betting that she could n't climb a tree . She went up it like a monkey and sat there laughing at me . " I was shivering again . I wished they would n't talk about her . It brought back the staring eyes , the sprawled legs . Mother Parry asked , " Did you have anything to drink , Bernard , when you were out with her ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Spike had been slouched on the divan . He sat up suddenly . " How about her family ? We ought to call someone . . .. " George said quietly , " I called her uncle . He 's the only relative I know of . I said I 'd call him back and tell him what ? what arrangements would be made . " " Does anyone want more coffee ? Spike , let me fill up your cup and bring me Jennie 's . The poor child is sitting over there shivering as though she had the ague . I suppose it was an awful shock to him . " " Shock ? Yes , I guess so . But they were never very close . " Delia was leaning against Bernard 's knees . " You never think about Margot as having any family . Just as though she 'd sprung from somewhere at the age of twenty-five , knowing everything there was to know , dressed in a tailored suit , wearing silver foxes . I ca n't think of her as a child at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never talked about it . Now I had n't known Jennie , here , forty-eight hours until I knew all about her family on the farm in southern Indiana . Her father raises horses , and they have a dog named Montgomery . But Margot ? not a word  --  never the words when I was a kid , I . . . ' Never anything like that . " Bernard put in bitterly , " I guess there was reason for that . She told me how her parents were divorced , and instead of fighting for her custody they fought about who was going to have to keep her . No wonder she was the way she was . " Delia 's voice was an anticlimax , cool against Bernard 's bitterness . " That 's not the story she told me . Her family was landed gentry in Kentucky . Yes  --  mint juleps , tall white columns , and all that stuff . Her parents  --  she gave me the impression of a white goatee , and true Southern beauty  --  were killed off romantically  --  but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing but , " and she singsonged , " nothing but the memory of the graciousness of their living . Hand me a cigarette , George . " No anger in her voice , but she tapped the cigarette viciously on the arm of Bernard 's chair . " I expect there were other stories of her antecedents , told to fit her audience . She was intrinsically a liar and a cheat . " " Delia ! " Mother Parry 's voice was furious . " Delia , that is no way to talk . " Delia said tiredly , " What difference does it make ? Because she 's dead , because she 's lying up there with a broken neck , which , I might add , she richly deserved , it does n't change the picture of Margot . Margot as she was . " Jim protested , " But it does n't seem right , Delia , to talk like that now . Somehow . I do n't know why . " She shrugged her shoulders . " Death erases . . . or does it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was the doctor , spruce and trim in a dark blue overcoat , a white muffler , his little bag in his hand . We must have looked like a motley crew . But the doctor , in  | spite of his own neatness , did n't seem to notice . He nodded to us , smiling , and said he 'd like to have someone go upstairs with him . It was Jim who offered to go . Mother Parry hurried after them , talking to herself . " Peg , I must tell him about Peg . " We could hear her at the bottom of the steps explaining to him , telling him about the tablets she had given her . He said he 'd look in on Peg while he was upstairs . None of us said anything at all . We could hear their footsteps , we could hear the rumbling of their voices . It had started to rain . It was splashing against the windows . There was the sound of a match being struck . I could hear Delia exhale as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovered it was mine , swinging against the chair next to me . I stopped it . George cleared his throat . I think everyone jumped . He said , " That 's the loudest clock I 've ever heard . " Delia answered , " We 've been meaning to get an electric one . " Silence again . Mother Parry coughed . She said , " Excuse me . " I had n't even realized Spike was beside me until he took hold of my hand . He whispered , " Your hand is warm . " His own were as cold as ice . I wanted to take them and hold them against me . He whispered , " Darling , " and there was warmth inside of me  --  comfortable warmth . Not fireworks , no . Happiness . We heard Jim 's footsteps running down the stairs , the doctor 's precise ones following him . The doctor was talking . " The sheriff should be here any time . He 'll probably bring the coroner with him . " Mother Parry asked , " Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she 's in a heavy sleep and she wo n't wake up for several hours . Her pulse is steady . It was a good thing you gave her the tablets . Shock like that is bad . I 'll leave something  | for you to give her when she wakens that wo n't put her under entirely but will deaden the feeling a bit . " " Wo n't you have a cup of coffee , Doctor ? " He sat down . " I 'd like it . I did n't take time to have any before I came over . " " We have n't had breakfast yet  --  none of us felt like eating , but we needed coffee . " I wanted to ask about Margot , but I waited , expecting him any minute to say something about her . He did n't . He said , " Just a bit of cream , and one lump of sugar . Now this is what I call good coffee . Strong . There 's a Greek restaurant on LaSalle Street  --  a hole in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's got the best coffee in Chicago . I 'll go blocks out of my way for a cup of his coffee . I 've asked him what kind he uses , how he makes it , but he just shrugs his shoulders . ' I mix ' em up , ' he says . I guess he means different kinds of coffee . I always tell my wife that , before she hires a maid , she should have her make a pot of coffee . " His voice was plaintive . " But she does n't think coffee is important . " Mother Parry said , " I do like the old-fashioned method of making coffee . Bring the water to a boil , mix your freshly ground coffee with an egg , and throw it in the boiling water  --  " " You know " ? he hunched forward ? " the best coffee I ever drank was up in the north woods . We 'd been on a hunting trip and  --  " I think if George had been a woman he 'd have screamed . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pick her up off the floor ? " The doctor blinked once or twice and said in the same tone of voice , " Why , no . We ca n't move her , you see , until the sheriff gets here . " " Oh , my God . " Only Mother Parry listened to the interminable story of the hunting trip and the coffee made over the fire .  | I do n't know what made me do it . Afterward I tried to rationalize it , but at the moment there was no feeling at all . I suppose what caused it was a culmination of everything . How I 'd felt when I came out Friday , the shock of meeting Spike , of realizing that someone else could wipe out the memory of Peter 's kisses  --  top all that off with the horror of Margot 's death , and the awful waiting we were doing , and the voice of the doctor going on and on . . . I could feel tears coming to my eyes . I could n't understand why I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes , really , tears  --  hot against my eyelids . I thought I could stop them . I tried to think of something else . It did n't do any good . They were coming so fast that I was going to have to do something about it . I did n't have a handkerchief . I held my head back . Sounds silly , but it seemed sensible at the time , as though by holding my head back the tears would stay in my eyes . That did n't do any good either . I had to sniff ; it made an awful noise in the room . They all looked at me . All but the doctor and Mother Parry . I could n't hold it any longer . I was crying , noisily , my face was wet , the tears were splashing on my sweater . My breath caught in my throat . There was a peculiar feeling in my stomach  --  fluttery . When I started to laugh I could n't understand that either . But it helped  --  it relieved that feeling in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was choking , but I could n't stop , and the tears kept right on coming . It was then Spike slapped me . I was gasping for breath , but his slapping me stopped the noise , stopped my laughing . By that time the doctor was there . I saw him push Spike aside . I could feel the whisky I had drunk coming up . I must have been an awful sight . Mother Parry and the doctor led me into the bathroom . His hand was cool on my head . I heaved . There was nothing to come up . He gave me something to drink . It tasted fresh , like wintergreen . It was  | wonderful . He said , " She 'll be all right now . She was , I suppose , a very good friend of the girl who died ? " " Yes , " Mother Parry said , " yes , she was . " " Poor girl . " He went out . Mother Parry put the top of the toilet seat down and sat me on it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minute . I put my arm on the bowl and laid my head on it . She came back . She pulled my sweater over my head  --  it was wet  --  and she slipped a clean blouse of Delia 's on me . She put cologne on my neck and on my forehead . She combed my hair , she powdered my face . She said , " Here , Jennie , put some lipstick on . " But I could n't . My hands were shaking . She took her little finger and rubbed some of it on my lips . " It 's not a very fancy job , Jennie , but it helps . " " Why , Mother Parry , did you tell him I was a close friend of Margot 's ? " " Oh , I do n't know . It just seemed simpler . " She helped a lot later , Mother Parry did , with her penchant for making things simpler . Spike was waiting outside the door . " Jennie , honey , are you all right ? " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Peter used to laugh at the word " honey " ? said it sounded like a waitress in a third-rate restaurant , like a cheap shopgirl . " I 'm so sorry , Spike . Sorry I acted so awful . " All the men stood up . I was ashamed to face them . I had let go and they had n't . The doctor made it a little better . He said , " We 'll have a few more cases like Miss  --  ah  --  Simpson 's , if you people do n't do something . " He walked around , turned on all the lamps . Delia stood up . " That 's a good idea , Doctor . We should eat , I think . " " By all means . " Jim said , " I am hungry . " Spike grunted , " Do n't fix anything for me . I could n't eat . "  | " Oh yes . " The doctor sounded professional , dictatorial . " You 'll eat . " I wondered why he stayed around , found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the coroner . He was a great help . He and Jim and Mother Parry and Delia had breakfast on the table in no time at all . " I fancy myself as a cook , " he said . We did eat , strangely enough . Even Bernard came to the table . There was a little while , there , that we almost forgot what had happened . The doctor had been in France when the war started , and he told us what a time he had getting home ; about southern France , and the people he 'd met while he was waiting for his ship . It was like a poem I 'd read in the New Yorker about misery  --  and how one way of doing away with your own misery was thinking of someone else 's . We lost importance , listening to the doctor 's calm recital of the unhappiness of those hundreds of people . It seemed a comparatively minor thing  --  the fact that a red-haired girl had fallen down a ladder and broken her neck . That little space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things that had to be done . Even Bernard . Delia told him he 'd have to do something about a fire . He got dressed , went off into the utility room . We could hear him chopping kindling wood , cleaning out ashes , shoveling coal . Spike asked Jim to go upstairs and get his clothes for him . We thought about our offices . We wrote down names and numbers for Jim to call . I found myself in the living room , picking up , dusting , emptying ash trays , running the sweeper . George and the doctor were helping Delia with the dishes . Mother Parry was making beds . All of us busy as little beavers . I had spread a newspaper out on the floor and was using it for a dumping ground . Cigarette stubs , bits of chewing-gum paper , apple cores . I picked up the wastepaper basket , upended it on the newspaper . The torn sheets of George 's drawing papers fell over the other stuff . He had torn the sheets two or  | three times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you could get some idea of his drawing . I had been curious . I had wanted to see whether or not he was any good . I picked up a few of the pieces , intending to fit them together . I did n't need to . Margot 's face , crowned by the moving serpents of Medusa 's head . Margot 's head twisted back , long hair hanging , her neck unnaturally elongated , two immense hands tightened around it . I was to dream later of the agony pictured on the face  --  the swelling , distended eyes , the open mouth . There was a cat 's face , snarling ; beside it , two hands twisted . I dropped them on the pile of junk . I looked around the floor to see that nothing had fallen there . I wrapped the newspaper around it . I got another newspaper . It made a tight , compact bundle . I went out to the kitchen . " I 'm going to take this stuff to the furnace . Any garbage you want burned ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in the container there , Jennie . We can take it all out later . " I made my voice as airy as possible . " Might as well take it out now . " I opened the door of the utility room . Bernard was squatted in front of the furnace , looking into the opening . I was relieved to see the light of the fire on his face . If he had n't got it started yet .. . " I 've some stuff here to burn . " " Put it in the basket , Jennie . I save papers there to start the fire . " " Just as well throw it in now . " I slung the package into the brisk fire , stood and watched it char and go up in flames . Never once thinking why . No logic to anything I did . It was just something that had to be done . I was n't sure why it made me feel guilty when the sheriff came . As though I were concealing something when there was no reason for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , businesslike . There  | was a much younger man with him who seemed to be a sort of errand boy . They went upstairs with the coroner and Dr. Medved . We sat around some more , but Mrs. Hallowell came in about that time , so that we were n't listening to the sounds they made . She talked a mile a minute . She talked so fast I got to wondering whether I could possibly take it down in shorthand . I was making the symbols in my mind . " Such a terrible thing to have happened . She was that beautiful red-haired girl , was n't she ? I said to Elmer this morning , after the boys left , that that must be the one . We 've noticed her out here before  --  always so gay and full of life . It 's awful to see anyone so young go  --  but then  --  well , maybe they 're saved a lot of unhappiness . I always say , it is n't the ones who die who are to be pitied , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't she . . . " She looked around the room . Spike and Bernard were the only men there . " Was n't she engaged to that young fellow  --  the stocky one with the curly hair ? " Mother Parry said yes , she guessed she was . " I remember once , " Mrs. Hallowell laughed softly , " once Elmer and I saw them kissing each other on the trail that goes through the tamarack swamp . It was sweet . Elmer was positively romantic about it . Said it reminded him of the time before we were married . " It went on forever . She wanted to know all about us . She said to Delia , " Elmer and I often talk about how nice it is for you people to have so many week-end guests . How you manage I do n't know . Why , when the children come home and bring friends with them , I 'm exhausted . And you with a job , too . Well , I suppose I could have done it when I was your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children , I had no time for guests . Now  --  and is n't it typical ? ? when we do have time and money for entertaining , we just do n't seem to care . The two of us putter around and read and take naps . " She sighed , then went on briskly , " But really , what I came over for was  | this . Elmer said that you 'd be all disrupted , and you would n't feel like cooking , but you would have to eat  --  and we want you all to come over for dinner this evening . " Delia objected , Mother Parry objected . It was awfully nice of her , but they could n't think of putting her to all that trouble . " Trouble ? Why , it 's no trouble at all . Elmer stayed home from the office  --  not that that 's anything unusual ; I think they get along better without him  --  but he stayed home , and he 's over there now putting extra leaves in the table , and he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinks , because you 'd all enjoy a good stiff cocktail . Why , the poor man will be desolate if you do n't come . And I 've got a roast already in the oven . Really , it 's no trouble at all . " They gave in . What else could they do ? She went out , talking steadily , repeating again how many there would be . " About four o'clock , shall we say ? " " Whew ! " Spike stretched out his legs . " Does she always go on like that ? Maybe going over there for dinner is n't such a good idea . " George was back in the room . He said , " I think it was nice of her . Neighborly . Reminds me of my childhood and how the neighbors always rallied round when something happened . Cakes and coleslaw . Talking and curious , yes , but helping . " Spike yawned . " Elmer sounds like a nice old codger . Cocktails . He 's got a sympathetic nature anyway . " Jim said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be awful . IIe 'll either have a book of recipes and mix something ungodly fancy , or else he 'll have some of those ready-mixed things . " George smiled . " You always have to drink them . And they keep asking you whether they 're good . You smack your lips and tell them how swell they are , and where did they learn to make them  --  and all the time you 'd sell your soul for a good whisky and soda . " Delia remarked apologetically , " I suppose I could have  | thought of some way to get out of it , but she  --  well , she insisted so , and accepting seemed to be the easiest thing to do . " Jim and Spike and George all said no , no , that was n't what they meant . As a matter of fact , they thought it was a splendid idea . Spike said , " We ca n't sit around here stewing in our own juice . We 'll go nuts . " I saw Jim go over to Bernard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They went into Bernard 's bedroom . I had got beyond the stage of wondering about things . So much already . I had n't even allowed myself to think about that moment in the upper hallway , as Bernard and I had stood over Margot 's dead body , and he had said , " My son , my son . " There had been my immediate reaction , So that 's how she got him . I was relieved , in a sense , to know that it had n't been because he had loved her . I mean , the kind of love he and Delia had together . But I had n't allowed myself to think of Delia . I did n't want to remember the conversation I 'd heard them having Saturday night . What it must have meant to her to realize that Margot , whom she hated and despised , who stood for all the rottenness that was so alien to Delia , should be the woman who was to bear Bernard 's child . I could understand why she had been so ill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only I do n't think I could have been as nearly normal as she was . Seems to me I would have ordered Margot out of the house , that I 'd have shoved Bernard out too . I could imagine Bernard trying to tell Delia about it . How he must have stammered around . Words were n't any too easy for him . Delia would be the one who 'd do most of the talking . Fighting . Fighting for Bernard . She 'd say , " It 's not true . She 's lying to you . It 's a trick , " knowing all the time that Margot would be too smart to lie about a thing like that . Bernard would be shocked to realize Delia could even suppose such a thing . He 'd criticize Delia for it . She 'd see him siding in his mind with Margot , and desperately she 'd strike out again . " She did it purposely . She 's too smart to do anything so banal  | as getting pregnant . She 's had too many men to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know how Bernard would react to that ! He 'd say it , I know he 'd say it . " Delia ! You 're speaking of the woman who 's carrying my child . " She 'd break down , then , crying  --  sorrow and anger together . " Yes , the woman who 's carrying your child . How you can let her have your child is more than I can see . It will be rotten , as she is rotten . It will lie and cheat , too , and you 'll be sorry it was ever born . You ought to kill it now . You ought to take her to a doctor and pay him a hundred dollars to kill it . No good will come of this . Poor little life growing ? conceived in deceit , conceived out of meanness , conceived because you were carried away by a wicked body . Bernard , Bernard , how can you let this thing happen ? Ca n't you see how wrong it is ? God knows " ? crying so hard she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how badly you want a child . Because I do too . It 's worse for me , it 's worse because I was made for it . Nature intended me to have a child . " But none of her talking would get her anywhere . He 'd sit stubbornly , able to see only one thing ? that Margot was pregnant , that it was his fault , therefore he had to leave Delia to marry Margot . It would be simple , unanswerable logic in his mind . None of her talking would do any good . Later I was to wonder whether it had , whether some of the things she had said had trickled through to him . During the ride he had taken with Margot things may have come out ? things which he had n't noticed before , that would make his slow mind quicken , that would move him to sudden , desperate action . . . At least knowing what I knew could make me understand , as none of the others could , Delia 's reaction . The cold hatred in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I would tell Spike about it sometime , so that he would understand too , so that he 'd know Bernard had n't been leaving  | Delia because of an infatuation for Margot . I thought Spike should know  --  to kill the criticism of Bernard that must be in his thoughts . There was movement in the quiet room when the sheriff and the others came down . He talked to Jim , just as though Jim were the man of the house , the one in charge . " I 'm having Bill call an ambulance from town . We 've completed what investigation needs to be made  --  except for some questions I 'd like to ask you people . Go on , Bill , get going . There 's a telephone in the house at the foot of the hill . " Dr. Medved said good-by to all of us . We hated to see him go . He was our friend , and this other doctor , this coroner , was a stranger . He had a notebook and a pencil . None of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one too , but he did n't write in it . He looked at it  --  must have been notes he 'd made upstairs  --  and asked us questions from it . I was glad we 'd all got dressed before he arrived . We looked like the thoroughly nice group of people we were . Delia had on a black dress with a white frill at the throat ; she and Bernard , in a business suit , sat together on the couch , their hands clasped , which was fit and proper . Jim and George and Spike were all in sports clothes , but they 'd shaved , and they looked tanned and clean and wholesome . Mother Parry was in a print house dress  --  crisp , starched  --  very solicitous to see that the sheriff sat where the light was good , that there was an ash tray beside him . While I was looking us over , thinking of the impression we were making on the sheriff , I wondered again what difference it made . Like when I burned those drawings  --  why was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made itself felt he began talking , and I forgot about it . " You 're all here now , are n't you ? " He read off the names . " That is , everyone but the girl who discovered the body . " It seemed strange to hear him say young Peg 's name so formally :  | " Margaret Van Meter . We 'll have to get a statement from her later . Now I 'd like to have you tell me just what happened . If you 'll excuse me I 'll tell each of you when to talk . " He smiled . " Usually everyone wants to talk at once , and it makes it difficult to get a clear picture . " He had beautiful white teeth . " As I understand it , Mr. Parry , you and the deceased were out riding after the others had gone to bed ? " " Yes . " Bernard 's voice surprised me . Controlled , even . " I was reading here in the living room  --  must have been about eleven-thirty  --  when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was going outside for fresh air . I offered , of course , to go with her . We decided to drive . We rode around until she got sleepy , and came back to the house . " " But you did n't come in with her ? " " No . . . " He hesitated . " I wish now that I had . " The sheriff 's voice was impatient . " Yes , yes , of course . " Bernard went on . " It 's a little difficult to explain what I did then . I wanted a drink . The drive had made Margot sleepy , but it made me wide awake . I 've been dickering with Steve Kosich down in the village to put an addition onto his place , so I decided to go see him and kill two birds with one stone . " He hesitated again , looked at the sheriff . " I do n't suppose I 'm telling anything on Steve ? " " No  --  no , we know about Steve . Someday we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proper times . " " Well , I went down there and had a couple of drinks and talked to Steve . " He ended abruptly . " Came back home and went to bed . " " What time was that ? " It was the first time Bernard had been at a loss , but it seemed quite logical . " I do n't know . I have n't any idea . Maybe I 'd had more than a couple of drinks , but I have n't any idea what time it was . " The sheriff turned to Delia . " Did you notice , Mrs. Parry ? " Delia had a lovely smile . " I 'm sorry , but I 'd taken sleeping  | tablets and I was sleeping so soundly that I heard nothing until this morning . " Bernard put in quickly , " But I did n't go into our room . I was foggy , but not so foggy that I did n't realize it would be better not to waken Delia . " The sheriff grinned at that . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wife all riled up at a time like that . " He went on around the room . I was barely listening . Bernard had shocked me so . How did he happen to think up that tidy little story ? This morning ? the way he had raved  --  and now he was being helpful and honest and convincing . We all had a chance to tell how Peg had wakened us with her screaming . Mother Parry knew when that was . " I 'd just gotten up and dressed . I knew I 'd have to be busy getting everyone off , so I got up quite early . I had the alarm set for fivethirty . " The sheriff mused , looking at his notes , " I wonder how the girl happened to waken . " Mother Parry said , " She probably heard the alarm . Peg always was an early riser . " The sheriff rehashed the whole thing . Ended up by saying , " Dr. Kelley figures she died between four and five hours before she was found . Died immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had realized what the others were doing . The atmosphere had n't gotten through to me at all . It just seemed that everybody was being helpful and co-operative , and I suddenly saw how I could be extremely helpful . " Oh , " I said , " I can tell you exactly when she fell . It was shortly after one-thirty . " I knew the minute the words were out that it was the wrong thing to say . I did n't know why , but they all looked at me , sharply , as though I were Judas Iscariot . " How is that , Miss Simpson ? How could you know ? " It was too late now . I could n't think of any way to cover up . " I heard her fall . "  | " You  --  what ? " " I was awake , and I heard her fall . " " But  --  did n't you do anything ? " " No  --  no  --  I thought I was hearing the ghost . . . . " I hated myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me as though I were speaking a foreign language . " Ghost ? " he asked unbelievingly . Spike started talking . " Jennie , Sheriff Thompson , is a highly imaginative girl . We 'd made the mistake of telling her the story we made up once of a ghost that haunts the house . We should have known better . Anyway , she woke up and apparently heard Margot fall , and thought it was the ghost , had a few minutes of fright , and then went back to sleep . " " Now let me get this straight . You told her there was a ghost that haunted the house , and she heard this girl fall from the ladder and thought it was the ghost ? " It made me seem such a fool that I could n't help speaking in my own defense . " You see , the ghost was supposed to walk along the hallway , climb the ladder , and fall , and I thought when I heard it that I had imagined it . " " Wait a minute , wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How does it happen that this ghost story so nearly approximates what did happen ? " Delia 's voice was cool . " Have n't you heard the story of this house , Sheriff ? " " No , I have n't . You see , this particular residential subdivision so seldom needs the services of the sheriff . " She told him the story of how they had happened to buy the house . " It was silly of us to make up the ghost story , but you know how those things start . A crowd of people sitting around a fire telling horror stories and first thing you know you 've made one up as a joke . It was kind of fun  --  it added intrigue to the house . " " Not exactly my idea of humor . What I ca n't understand , Mr. Parry , is why , knowing of that one fatal accident , you would n't have put a stairway there . "  | Bernard stirred . " It is inexcusable negligence on my part . But we almost never used the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in case we needed to go up there . " " How did it happen that this girl was sleeping there ? Plenty of room downstairs , seems to me . " " She liked it . She was a light sleeper and if we were noisy we would n't bother her . She could sleep as late as she wanted in the morning . " " But that ladder . Why , man alive , I would n't want to climb it myself more often than was absolutely necessary . " I almost made another break . I almost quoted what George had said about Margot 's being so sure-footed . I did n't , probably because the sheriff went right on talking and I did n't have a chance . It was n't good sense that kept me still . He said , " But I suppose this girl was athletic and did n't mind . I mean , her body looks as though she 'd been naturally active  --  " It was George who made me glad I 'd kept still . " No more so than anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than sleeping downstairs where she might be disturbed by early risers . " " I see . " He looked at his notebook . After a short silence he seemed to have made a decision . " I think , " he said , " I think we 'll leave that out about Miss Simpson hearing her fall  --  and the ghost story . It 'd sound funny at the inquest , and I ca n't see that it 's important . We 'll leave the time of death at what Dr. Kelley suggested . I do n't think it 'll make any difference . " He repeated the whole thing , started with Margot 's going out with Bernard . " Mr. Parry lets her out in front of the house , drives down to Steve Kosich 's place . The deceased goes upstairs , does n't get a flashlight , climbs the ladder in the darkness , misses her footing , and falls ; dying instantly of . . . " And he quoted medical terms . He went on with Peg 's discovering the body , how he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's concurring with that report . He stopped , as though he  | were putting a period  --  a heavy , black period  --  to the story . It was really a semicolon ; but before we realized that , I had turned to Spike , trying to tell him by looking at him that I was sorry I 'd spoken out of turn . He got the idea , he patted my hand , started to whisper , but as the sheriff looked up quickly he spoke aloud . " Make us look like a bunch of nincompoops , Jennie , will you ? " I smiled at the sheriff . " I 'm afraid I made myself look like a prize ninny . " He smiled back at me . Maybe his teeth were false  --  almost too white to be real . " I guess we 're not entirely responsible for what we think when we wake up in the middle of the night . " I believe they were real . He was nice . I liked him . He was quiet for a long time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , grabbed a package of cigarettes , and started around the room . Everybody lit up . The sheriff blew out a long line of smoke . " The thing we ca n't understand ? both Dr. Kelley and Dr. Medved mentioned it  --  " I was holding my breath . I 'd be willing to bet money that the others were too . Like being tortured . Wondering what could be next . Again the nagging thought in my mind : what were we afraid of ? What was the thing that was making us cover up ? Why was I so conscious of everyone waiting , breathless , fright : ened , for what he was going to say ? He took another deep drag on his cigarette . " We ca n't understand what made the scratch on her cheek . " I remembered it . I remembered how it cut red across the whiteness of her skin . I felt Spike 's hand tighten on mine . George got up and walked to the window . The sheriff 's voice went on . " We looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have scratched it falling . There were n't any . " George 's voice was quiet . " I noticed it . I thought perhaps she might have scratched it with her hand as she was falling . "  | " Her hands were clenched , tight . That 's another strange thing . " He crossed his knees , talked on evenly . " You 'd think that she 'd have grabbed for the railing , that her hands would have been open , grasping . Instead they were clenched tightly ? into fists . " Jim leaned forward . " Could that have happened , Doctor , after she fell ? For instance , if she were grabbing for the railing , then when she hit the floor a kind of reflex action could tighten her hands ? " The doctor spoke for the first time . " Possible , " he said . Just the one word . " It 's that scratch , though . " The sheriff 's face wrinkled up in thought . " Like  --  like a cat 's scratch . . . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken by Delia 's breath , gasping . The sheriff looked at her , and she started to cough . He went on , " But I notice that you do n't have a cat . " " But we do . " Mother Parry spoke up . " A Persian . However , he 's seldom in the house this weather . From early spring until late fall we see very little of him . Such lovely fat rabbits we have around here . " She smiled at the sheriff . " Sometimes he brings them home , poor bunnies . But one thing about him , he does n't bother the birds . Of course we would n't allow that . But rabbits are different . They are a nuisance . They eat up our flowers and kill the young trees . " " He was n't in the house , then , last night ? " " Oh no . I fed him some milk at bedtime and let him out . As a matter of fact " ? she looked around the room ? " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ? " No one had seen him . I was the only one who did n't speak up . I was remembering . I had fallen over him as I was running out of the room this morning , stumbled over him , felt his warm fur against my bare feet as I followed the screams upstairs . The ghastly , sickening picture in my mind . Mister Blister hearing the fall as I had last night , padding quietly upstairs  | to investigate , coming on Margot 's body , and striking out at it . It made me sick . He 'd snarl , remembering her , and slash out with his wicked long claws , scratch the lovely white face . How she would have hated it ... . " Spike  --  Spike . " I could hardly see . " Spike , I 'm going to be sick again . " Mother Parry rushed over , got me into the bathroom . I heard the sheriff say , " That 's the girl who went to pieces this morning , is it ? " When I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm sorry , Miss Simpson . You 'll forgive me , I know . You see , I 've got to talk about it even though I know how painful it must be to all of you . " He looked at me more closely . " You did n't ever go to Northwestern , did you ? " I shook my head . " Seems as though I must have met you somewhere .... " My voice was almost normal . " Lots of people think that . I guess I 've got a common type of face . " He was profuse in his apologies . " Oh no , no , I 'd never say that . It 's that you give me the feeling that I must have known you . . . . " He laughed . " As though we should be friends . " I was amused at Spike . He came right over and put his arm around me  --  so possessive . " All right now , honey ? " The sheriff backed away . No more was said of the scratch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next day , that it would be mere routine . He was very formal when he said good-by to me ; he ostentatiously held out his hand to Spike . Pals , all of us , in that good-by . Bernard was once more the master of the house . He took them to the door . Bill , the errand boy , said the ambulance would come in half an hour . We relaxed . Everybody moved around . They razzed me about the sheriff 's falling for me . Jim said , " By gosh , Jennie , any time I run afoul of the law I 'm going to call you in and let you bug your eyes at the police . " George shook his head . " I think it 's the dimple that does the  | trick . It 's so unusual to see only one dimple . Do you make it come and go at will , Jennie , or does it just happen ? " " Do n't make fun of me  --  " " We think you 're wonderful . You were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Listen , you idiots , it 's an effect I have on people . " " Yeah , we got that . " " I mean  --  well , I give them a homey feeling . It 's that , really it is  --  people are always saying they feel as though they 'd known me all their lives . " " Damn ! " Spike was watching me . " I was saving that to tell you . I was going to mention how the minute Delia introduced us I felt as though I 'd known you all my life . And now I discover it 's old stuff . " " It certainly is . Tell me I 'm glamorous , Spike , that 'll really thrill me . " " But you 're not , thank goodness . " " Just someone comfortable to have around , I suppose . " " That 's right , Jennie . " He set down his glass . " How about you and me going for a walk ? " He must have read my mind . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " George said , " Hey , that 's a fine idea . " Delia laughed , " Do n't go butting in , George . They want to be alone . " " Oh  --  oh  --  pardon me . " Spike slapped him across the back . " It 's all right , old man . Some other time . " Trees dripped water on us , but we did n't mind . We walked along hand in hand . " Funny , " he said , " that out of such a ghastly week end something so nice should come . I mean you . " He could n't know , possibly , how extraordinarily thankful I was for him . I 'd tell him sometime how he 'd chased a dark , aquiline-faced ghost ; how his own rough brown hair had blotted out neat , crisply curled black hair . Yes , sometime I 'd tell him .  | Now it was enough to be away from the house , to be out in the fresh air with the sodden leaves dripping water on us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , sorry that they had to watch for the ambulance , that they must be there as her body was carried out . I do n't know how far we walked , or for how long . We had so many things to talk about . When we were almost back to the house he said , " Yes , Jennie , all my life I 've been looking for a girl who could not only play a good game of bridge , but who was also pleasant to kiss . Too many good bridge players wear pince-nez . By the way , can you cook ? " " Oh , I can whip up a fried egg if necessary . " " Well , " he sighed , " I ca n't have everything . And you do play a good heady game of bridge . " " Thank you , Spike , thank you . " " But I wonder . . . there was one thing that bothered me the other night , and you did it several times . When you answer my original bid with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the next round you pop in with a suit bid . Why ? " " Well , that 's simple . I 've got a long suit I ca n't mention the first bid . I 've got to show you I have no support for you and a low count  --  with my one no-trump . But  --  if the bid is still open I can pop in with a suit bid  --  " " Now wait a minute , wait a minute . Your one no-trump shows me the full strength of your hand . It says that your hand is too weak to bid again . " " I do n't know why . " " It 's the rule . You 've got to play according to rules . You ca n't go changing  --  " " Who ever heard of a rule like that ! You never saw that rule anywhere . " We went round and round about it . He was yelling , I was yelling , and I could n't make him see my point at all . I said ,  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Come on back to the house and we 'll ask George . " " George ! What the hell does he know about it ? " " Just as much as you do . Who do you think you are  --  Cul-bertson ? " " Jennie , I 'm just trying to show you  --  " " But you do n't know what you 're talking about . Listen  --  " We had come up behind the house . " Oh , look , " I said , " there 's Mister Blister . That 's just where he was sitting Friday night when Jim and I drove up . " His back was to us as he sat on the low stone wall . His tail switched back and forth , back and forth . Spike called , " Here , Mister , come on , Mister . " He did n't turn his head . " Silly cat  --  goes his own way  --  does n't pay any attention . . . " We walked up behind him , looked where he was looking , and stood transfixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood there at the door waiting . It was gray . A young fellow , hatless , lounged beside it smoking a cigarette . I wanted to go away . Maybe Spike did too , but we stood there . We heard voices , we heard someone yell , " Al  --  open the door . " The young fellow threw down his cigarette , dashed over , and opened the screen . Two men carrying a stretcher . The sheet did n't quite cover her . You could see the lovely red of her hair . I turned , put my face against Spike 's arm , and waited until I heard the door shut , waited until I heard the engine start . " Jennie , " Spike said , " let 's do n't go into the house for a bit . " You could see the gray ambulance winding down the hill . He went up to the side porch , got two waterproof pillows from the swing , put them on the stone wall . We sat there . Mister Blister was lying stretched out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't talk for a while . I was thinking about the whole business . Finally I said , " Spike , why was it so awful for me to have said what I did about hearing her fall ? " " Aw  --  all that about the ghost seemed ridiculous . It made us out a bunch of morons . " " That was n't all of the reason . Where did Bernard get his story about the ride they took ? Everybody was hiding things ? and I do n't understand why . " " I guess maybe we did , but you ought to know why , Jennie . My gosh , if we 'd ever let any of the truth out about Margot , it would have made a helluva-sounding story . " " In other words " ? I was speaking carefully ? " you were trying to keep any references to Margot 's affair with Bernard ? and all that  --  out of it ? " " Yes . You see , Margot 's death will be news value . She had some reputation as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairly well known as an advertising woman , and it would be awful if any hint got into the papers of the situation here . You can see what it would mean to Delia and Bernard . " We lit fresh cigarettes . " Mother Parry lied , you know . " " Did she ? " It was put in the form of a question , but it was n't a question . He knew as well as I did . " Yes , about the cat . He was in the house last night . He 's in the house every night and she said he was n't . " He shrugged his shoulders . " So what ? What difference does it make ? It was a little lie , and it stopped a bunch of questions . " " I think " ? I was knocking my heels against the stone wall ? " I think Jim made up that story for Bernard . " " He probably did . Sounded quite sensible , too , did n't it ? It would take an evil mind to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished . And certainly our friend the sheriff is clean-minded . Practically a boy scout , I 'd say . " I ignored that . " I wonder what we 'd have done if Jim had n't  | been here ? Funny , to see him taking charge . He 's always seemed such an impractical soul . Playing the piano and playing chess . " " If you ever saw him in a business deal you would n't think so . He drives a close bargain . His piano playing is a good blind . And  --  he was the only one here , besides you , who had n't ever been tied up with Margot in some way or other . They never got along well together . " " They did n't ? " " Nope . I never could figure it out , never could decide who made the pass and who did the rebuffing . " I tried to make my voice sound disgusted . " But there had to be a pass . " " Oh sure . Margot was always either passing or being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we go in ? " " O.K. " He jumped down off the wall , held his arms up for me . Mister Blister walked along beside us . When Spike opened the door the cat went in ahead of me . I stopped , watched him . " Spike , he knows ... " " Knows what ? " " Knows that Margot is no longer here . " " Jennie . " Spike took hold of my shoulders , looked into my face . " Will you snap out of it ? " " What do you mean ? " " Listen , darling , Margot has died . It 's been a bad time for all of us . It makes it worse when you keep going over and over the thing in your mind , and saying things like that . It makes it just that much harder for the rest of us . Now for gosh sake lay off of it . Do n't talk about it . " I thought he was being unfair , as though the others were being good soldiers and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was curt answering him . " O.K. , O.K. I 'll watch myself . I 'll not discuss it again . "  | He tried to say something else , but I jerked away from him and walked into the living room . They were all dressed , ready to go to the Hallowells ' . It was three-thirty and we 'd have to hurry . Jim had offered to stay behind . They thought someone should be there in case Peg woke up . We started down the hill a short time later . I walked with Bernard and George and Mother Parry . Spike could be with Delia  --  and admire a fine stiff upper lip . The Hallowells greeted us with just the proper mixture of regret at what had happened and pleasure at seeing us . Elmer was round and bald  --  and his drinks were good . He had martinis ; the olives in them were stuffed with anchovies , so I was happy . As a matter of fact I drank too many just to get the olives . He had manhattans , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They had a lovely house . Not one built to fit the dunes , but the kind of a house you 'd expect to find on the best street of a not-so-large town . It reminded me of the banker 's house in my town , so I felt right at home . We talked about the weather , and Elmer 's garden , and what really marvelous success he 'd had in growing flowers in the sand . He said he was sorry we could n't see the garden in all its glory , but after dinner he 'd get out his projection machine and show us the colored pictures he 'd taken . He 'd won a prize at a flower show with his ruffled petunias . It was the best thing in the world for us . We talked and laughed as though nothing at all had happened . Spike followed me around . I did n't pay any attention to him . Finally he cornered me in a bay-window effect and started talking . What had he done to offend me ? Whatever it was , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him as though he was n't there . I let him go on for a while and then told him I 'd been annoyed at his inferring that I was n't acting right . I said , " You  | know , it 's a rather unusual situation for me . I do n't usually go visiting week ends and run into people having affairs and falling down ladders and getting killed . . . . " Which was n't kind , but I could n't help saying it . Well , anyway , we got it patched up . We sat together at dinner , laughed heartily at Elmer 's jokes , held hands under the table . It was a good dinner , slightly on the heavy side , and Mrs. Hallowell was a cook who seasoned with a heavy hand . I did n't use good judgment , but I could n't resist the heavenly hot mince pie . I knew it was a mistake to eat it . We went back to the living room . I began to feel funny , and I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but get sick  --  and after what Spike had said . . . When Elmer started showing the slides I slipped out of the darkened room to the kitchen , explained to Mrs. Hallowell and Mother Parry that I was going to run up to the house for a minute , and I 'd be right back . When I got out into the air I felt much better . The sun had gone down and it was just beginning to get dark . The air was soft . It was nice to be alone for a change . I walked slowly up the hill , noticing the streaks of red in the sky . It would be pleasant having a house out here . A small one . I 'd not have a garden like Elmer 's . I 'd let it be wild  --  except for the poison ivy . That would have to come out . I 'd even let the bittersweet stay . I looked around for Jim when I went into the house , but he was n't anywhere downstairs . I started to put on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have come to . I ran up the stairs . The upper hallway was almost dark . I hesitated , started to call his name , but before I did I looked up . I could see there at the top of the ladder a light shining  --  brightly . It was on the floor and I could n't figure out what could make such a bright light .  | I did n't stop to think . I guess you do n't at a time like that . There 's some urgency that drives you on without thinking . If I had I know I would n't have started up the ladder . I was n't frightened at climbing ? I was hardly conscious of the steepness , of the round rungs that I could feel through the crepe soles of my oxfords . But I was frightened when I got to the top . I hung desperately to the railings on either side of me . Jim was sitting back on his heels , picking at the floor . He had a flashlight propped shining against the place where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even when I realized what he was doing it did n't make sense . Bits of long sandy fur were caught in the roughness of the wood . He was pulling them out , carefully placing them in the envelope . " Jim ! " He lost his balance . He fell back , caught himself with one hand , but he 'd knocked over the flashlight . The beam went crazily up to the ceiling . He whispered , " What are you doing here , Jennie ? " I stepped up on the landing . " I got sick and came back . " He was standing looking down at me , the envelope still in his hand . There was a long silence . " I 'm trying , " he said , " to think up some logical reason ? other than the truth  --  to explain what I 'm doing . " He added helplessly , " I ca n't . " " Jim  --  could we do something about some light ? " I straightened the flashlight . He went into Margot 's room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could n't help but see the green robe thrown over the bed . I sat down on the floor . Jim stood there , his shoulders hunched . At last he knelt down on one knee . " I did n't think anyone would be back . I was sure I could get this done before  --  " He swept the hand holding the envelope out in a sweeping , meaningless gesture . The big shadow on the wall behind him moved menacingly .  | " You 've got to tell me , Jim . I 'm going crazy . Stark , raving mad . " But I was beginning to see . A lot of things were clearing up . Somehow it was better than the fogginess of knowing something was going on and not knowing what it was . " You 've got to keep this to yourself , Jennie . You 've got to . Margot would never have fallen down that ladder  --  never . She could have climbed it in her sleep . She was strong , Margot was , in more ways than one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to push her off . She 'd fight like a tiger . All of us knew that  --  everyone but you . I suspected when I saw the scratch on her cheek . I do n't know , maybe everyone else did too . I tried to get up here this morning and I did n't have a chance . When the sheriff and coroner were here I did come up . And the minute I saw this floor I knew what had happened . They would n't know . They 'd never notice the cat hairs caught in the wood , and even if they did , it would n't mean anything to them . " I could see her coming up the ladder in the dark , quickly , easily . I could see Mister Blister there too , sitting at the top as Delia said he had  --  his tail switching back and forth , angry because he wanted to get down and could n't . She would n't realize he was there until her face came even with the floor . He 'd snarl , throw out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at the feel of his fur on her face , she 'd go to pieces . She 'd fall backward . No scream , no sound at all , except the thud of her body as she hit the floor . I 'd given way so many times already that I do n't know why I did n't then . It seemed a peculiarly fiendish way for her to die  --  killed by the only thing she feared . . . . It took a little time for the other realization to come to me . " But  --  Jim  --  that means . . . " He was picking at the fur again . " Yes . " Just the one word . I was on my knees beside him , helping . We carried it to extremes . We hunted and hunted with the aid of the flashlight to be sure that there was n't one hair left .  | Monday Evening THERE WAS THE MOMENT when Jim and I opened the furnace door and threw in the envelope . The second time that day I stood watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much while we cleaned up the fur . There were only a few words during the whole process . " I 'll hold the flashlight , Jennie , you go on down . Careful ! " No need to tell me to be careful . Down the steps , through the dark hallway to the utility room . Only the sound of Jim 's breathing behind me , and the loud ticking of the clock . I washed my hands , scrubbed them , and went into the living room . Jim had turned on one lamp ; he was slouched in a big chair , his feet stretched out before him . Mister Blister walked over , rubbed against my legs , wanting to be petted . I hated the touch of him . I sat down , curled my legs under me . Jim was n't going to talk . He just sat there . My voice seemed awfully loud when I finally found the courage to say it . " Whom are we protecting , Jim ? " He did n't move . He did n't look up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear him . " I do n't know . " I wanted to talk . I had to talk . " I thought you 'd know . I thought you 'd have it all figured out . The cat did n't go up there by himself . Someone put him there , knowing what would happen . Who did it ? Who did it , Jim ? " " I told you . I do n't know . " " Why were you picking out those hairs ? You said no one outside would know what they meant . And yet you stayed behind purposely this afternoon so that you could destroy something  | that no policeman would ever think important . Why ? " He leaned forward . For the first time he looked at me . " Last night , Jennie , one of my very good friends committed murder . If a murder can be a good  --  this was a case in point . Like stamping out an evil . The others , the ones who are not guilty , may suspect , but they 're not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as I did , just what happened . " His voice broke , he buried his face in his hands . " Maybe I 'm screwy , but " ? and he looked up at me again , and his voice was a whisper ? " I do n't want them to know . It 's bad enough having to face the knowledge myself . " I opened the box of cigarettes , took one , and lit it . It was n't until some time later that the full realization was to come to me . At the moment I was completely detached , looking at the whole thing as though it was some group apart from me . " Of course , Delia is the logical one . She 's the one who had the strongest motive . She hated Margot , Margot was about to break up her marriage , but more than that  --  " I 'd probably have gone on thinking aloud if Jim had n't yelled at me . He was out of the chair , he was standing in the middle of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's sake , do n't talk about it . Do n't go on like that . " He started walking . Mister Blister watched him . Sometimes as Jim walked by him the cat would playfully catch at his trouser leg . Jim stopped , looked down at him . " Get out of here , God damn it , before I kick you out . " He yelled , " Get out , I said . " The cat got up , slunk out of the room meowing . He stood in front of me . I had to bend back my head to look at his face . " I did that too this morning . My mind was going around in circles  --  who  --  who  --  who ? Now I do n't want to know . I 'm not going to try to figure it out . I 'm not going to , I tell you . And I do n't want you to get me started again  --  figuring  --  accusing  --  wondering . It 's over , it 's done with  --  the hell with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than know definitely . "  | " Yes . " Belligerently he repeated , " Yes . I only wish I did n't know as much as I do . " His back to me as he walked , his face to me , he said , " I 'm sorry , Jennie , but I 've got to . " He sat down at the piano . I held fast to the arms of my chair . It was wicked music . It battered at my ears , but I envied him . I wished there was something I could do , something to release the awfulness inside of me . I recognized the softer strains when they started . The suggestion of discords , the minor key . Ile looked over his shoulder , his eyes bright , and he smiled . " Margot 's requiem , Jennie . " Softly he said , " For you , Margot . " Urgently he directed me , " Say those words , Jennie . The words you said last night  --  say them to the music . " When I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jennie . " I ca n't ever describe the command in his words , the almost crazed command in them that made me start , that made me do what he wanted me to . There was some part of my mind that said , He 's mad  --  you 're mad too , but I began . Words that had been learned half seriously , half humorously in the room at school , with Sally at her desk and me at mine , saying them back and forth to each other . It was as though , all of the years between , the verses had been waiting in my mind for this moment . .. . " Your naked new-born soul , their stake , Stood blind between ; God said , Let him that wins her take And keep Faustine . ' " The die rang sideways as it fell , Rang cracked and thin , Like a man 's laughter heard in hell Far down , Faustine.  | " A shadow of laughter like a sigh , Dead sorrow 's kin ; So rang , thrown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You could do all things but be good Or chaste of mien ; And that you would not if you could , We know , Faustine . " Did Satan make you to spite God ? Or did God mean To scourge with scorpions for a rod Our sins , Faustine ? " For in the time we know not of Did fate begin Weaving the web of days that wove Your doom , Faustine . " I stopped . The music went on . " No more , Jennie , no more ? " He repeated part of my words , over deep booming chords , " ' Like a man 's laughter heard in hell , ' " then high thin notes again , " ' A shadow of laughter like a sigh , ' " and tonelessly , " ' Weaving the web of days that wove your doom , Faustine : " I was shivering uncontrollably . I strained my ears to hear what he was saying . He was n't talking to me . " Your song , Margot . It 's the last time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He swung around , faced me , his hands clasping the edge of the piano bench . " She 'd have liked that , Jennie . That would mean more to her than Nearer , My God , to Thee ' ? or whatever they 'll play for her on the organ . " And , as though explaining to me , he said , " I had to do it . " " You make me  --  almost  --  sorry for her , Jim . " " She 'd hate you for that , Jennie . That 's why she hated me . That 's  --  " He stopped .  | The clock ticked on . Through the silence we heard Peg 's voice : " Mother Parry . Oh , Mother Parry . . . " We both jumped . Jim ran to the bookcase by the door . " Where the hell are those flashlights ? " He scrambled around . I called , " Just a minute , Peg . " And to Jim , " Where 's the one you had ? " " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are always flashlights here . Always . " As he said it he stopped hunting . He walked over to the hall closet , rummaged around , pulled out his jacket , got the flashlight . His voice was completely expressionless . " I suppose whoever took them away will put them back tonight . " We started up the stairs . Not even Peg 's crying voice could hurry us . Jim lit the lamp in her room . She blinked . " Hello , " she said , and smiled . " What time is it ? I ca n't " ? she wrinkled her forehead ? " it 's silly , but I ca n't think when it is . Is it morning  --  or evening ? Did I take a nap and not wake up ? " Jim sat down on the foot of her bed . " It 's evening , my pet , you 've slept all day . " " But the last I remember is  --  I do n't know  --  I thought it was Sunday , but today 's Sunday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I dreamed  --  Jennie , you know what I dreamed ? ? and it was as real as anything . I dreamed that Margot fell down the ladder and that I  --  that I . . . " She stopped . I sat down beside her . She grabbed hold of my arm with one hand . It hurt . " But it was n't a dream . Or was it ? Tell me , tell me . " Not screaming , no . The quietness was worse than screaming  --  the tightness in her young voice . I might as well come out with it . " It was n't a dream , Peg . " Jim started out of the room . " I 'll get that stuff the doctor left . " " She 's dead ? Margot 's dead ? " " Yes , "  | She let go of my arm . She pushed her hair back from her face . " I guess I knew all the time it was n't a dream . I guess I was just trying to make myself believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I put my arm around her . The silly words you say ? " There , there , Peg , there , there . . . " She cried steadily . Jim brought the medicine up and she took it docilely . He said something to her about keeping a stiff upper lip . She almost smiled . " Margot would say I was a big crybaby . " I said , " I think you need food , Peg . Jim and I will go down and fix you something to eat . " " You stay here , Jennie . Do n't leave me , Jennie . " I got her clothes together , helped her into them . " I am hungry , " she said . There was a bad moment when we started out into the hall . We stood outside the door , my aim around her waist , hers over my shoulder . She was taller than I and heavy . She leaned against me . " If only I had n't fallen  --  oh , Jennie . . . " And she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , down the stairs . Jim was bustling around . The rooms looked cheerful . He 'd turned on all the lights . There was the smell of coffee . " It 's a mixture , Peg , half a grapefruit  --  a small steak . . . " Even Peg had to laugh at the salad he 'd made . Two slices of pineapple on a wisp of lettuce , a big gob of cottage cheese topped by a prune  --  and slathered with mayonnaise . " You should name it , Jim , it 's unique . Sort of a double-dip effect . " " It 's got lots of vitamins , anyway . " Peg ate heartily . " I thought men always made salads of greens in bowls , with bottles of dressing and seasonings  --  " " Oh , that 's the ads you 've been reading . I had no choice . I had to use what was in the refrigerator . " We were each having a cup of coffee . Peg took a cigarette .  | " I keep expecting her to walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angel  --  ' " We used all the old hackneyed phrases to her . Tattered , timeworn , supposedly comforting things . " She 'll never grow old , Peg , " Jim said , " and you know how Margot would have hated that . You can remember her  --  beautiful and young ... " " Yes . " Peg nodded her head . " She was so beautiful . I wish I were like her . I wish I were n't so big and awkward . " " Darling , you 're not  --  " Jim laughed . " All you lack , Peg , is a spot of sophistication . Personally , I like you the way you arc . " " I 'm going to have my hair cut and shaped . Margot said yesterday . . . said yesterday . . . " She took a drink of the coffee . " It 's too bushy and too long to be smart . It 's like a high school kid 's and I 'm too old for that sort of thing . " She finally got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to go over the whole thing for her . It was a practical objective version we gave her . It made us feel better , too , talking about it like that . None of the hysteria , none of the currents and crosscurrents  --  just a bare recital . We were washing the dishes when the others came back . How you cling to the everyday necessities of living when something is hanging over you ... . I concentrated on those dishes . So did Jim . Keeping the water sudsy and hot , being very careful about rinsing . Jim 'd polish and polish each dish or glass or spoon . I was sorry when we finished . I wished there was a mountain of dishes to wash , and hundreds of pots and pans . I 'd like to have spent the whole night washing dishes . I wiped the stove , I wiped the refrigerator , I polished the sink . The others had brought back groceries . Delia was putting them away , with the same care I was expending on the dishes . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flakes and shredded wheat and wheaties  --  so that everybody 'd be happy . Do you know that oranges have gone up again ? Honestly , the way  | prices are skyrocketing ! I got a ham for tomorrow . I thought I could put it in to bake early in the morning . . . . What I should do is bake a pie or two tonight . Darn ! I meant to get some of that prepared mincemeat and I forgot it . " I said , " It 's a lot of trouble for you , Delia , having us stay over . " " Oh no , Jennie . It 'd be silly for you all to go home and come back tomorrow . Besides , we like having you here . " I thought that was probably true . When we 'd discussed it in the morning they 'd been so insistent that we stay . Jim was standing by the stove , the tea towel hanging over his arm . He was humming softly , watching Delia . Mother Parry came into the kitchen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of milk , poured some of it into his dish . " I thought , Mother , I might bake a couple of pies tonight . " " Oh , do n't bother , Delia . I can make them in the morning . You 'd better get to bed early . " " Bed ! " Delia 's hands fumbled over the packages . " I think I will make them tonight . Might as well . Pumpkin ? " Jim spoke for the first time . " Yes . " If Mister Blister would only stay away from my ankles . . . I rinsed out the dishcloth . " Well , Jim , I guess that 's all . " Delia said , " And a fine workmanlike job you did , my little chickadees . Go in and relax now . " Spike was reading a newspaper . He looked up as we walked in . " Come over here , Jennie , I 've missed you . " I sat down beside him . He gave me a part of the paper . I looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The CIO is anti-American ; the CIO is the brotherhood of man . ... New York Finds Tax Drain on Big Business . . . .

I went into the bedroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something . Mother Parry came in with a basket of darning . Jim said , " I wish I had my fancywork here . Hey , Bernard , you got any of those crossword puzzle books ? " " Yes , in the drawer of the desk . " Spike looked over the newspaper . " One crack out of you , Jim , like What 's a four-letter word that begins with X and means an extinct Australian bird , ' and I 'll throw the nearest thing at hand . " Jim grinned . " Poor Jennie . " " Wise guy . " Spike went down behind the newspaper . I took the polish off my nails , went into the bathroom , soaked them , came out , and started trimming the cuticle . Spike was watching me . " Why in heaven 's name do you cut them like that ? " " To have a nice even line . Otherwise it would be ragged . " " What 's Delia doing out there ? " " Baking pies . " " Oh . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's George ? " " He had to go down to the village . " " What for ? " " Oh , I do n't know . He had some reason . Poor guy .

" " I think , Jennie , that George wanted to do a bit of solitary drinking , sitting at a bar with a bunch of total strangers . " Mother Parry spoke . " I hope he 's careful driving home . " " The drunker he gets the more cautiously he drives . That 's one thing about George . He 'll be hell tomorrow , though . There 's no one in the world suffers like George from drinking . " Spike laughed . " He tries all the remedies . And none of them works . He collects remedies . He 'll say , So-and-so told me that the best thing is to .. : So he tries that . " Mother Parry said dryly , " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mother Parry . . . " For the first time since I 'd met her I thought Mother Parry looked old . I noticed how drawn her face was , the deep circles under her eyes . Her hands were shaking as she threaded her needle . " Mother Parry , you look tired . Why do n't you lie down ? " She smiled at me . " I 'll go to bed after while , Jennie . I 'm not sleepy now . " Bernard looked up from the flies he was arranging neatly . " Mother is always the last one in bed , Jennie . " She put her darning egg in a gray sock . " Old people , Bernard , need so little sleep . " She pulled the thread through , then held the sock down on her lap . " I think sometimes it 's because we do n't want to miss anything . When we 're sleeping that 's so much of our allotted time taken up with  --  nothing . " Spike shivered . " Mother Parry , you sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that phrase . " " Yes " ? Spike 's fingers were entwined with mine ? " it gives you such an awful feeling of  --  well , I mean , it 's so much better to think you 're going to go on living forever . It 's as bad as the old idea of predestination . I 've hated that too . " Mother Parry took two or three stitches in the sock . " It 's a comfortable philosophy though , Jennie ; it helps you to accept things when they happen . "  | " You mean , because it was foreordained that I should break my leg ice skating that makes it easier to take ? " Her eyes twinkled at me . " You know that 's not at all what I mean . " She looked at all of us seriously . " I wonder  --  is it better for you  --  you young people  --  not believing in anything ? " Spike stirred . " We do believe in something , Mother Parry . In ourselves . " " You think you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bitter . " I think most of us have found that we have to be . We 're not dillusioned , then , when a thing happens to us and we have to face it alone . " She shook her head . " I ca n't accept it . " " Of course you ca n't . You were trained otherwise . But actually , Mother Parry , how many of the circumstances in your life that you 've been thankful for could be ascribed to divine interference ? I have an idea that if you had n't been the person you were  --  " " No , Spike , that 's not entirely true . " Her eyes gleamed behind the glasses she 'd put on . " There have been times when I was n't strong enough , when help came to me . . . " Spike grinned . " Mother Parry , if it were n't for respect for your gray head and your eighty-five years I 'd say a nasty word to that . " " Eighty-five ! How you talk , Spike . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " how anyone as strong as you are could waste any time being grateful , or praying , is quite beyond me . " She picked up the sock . " Strong ? Because I reared a son alone ? Because I worked ? " " No , not that . Because when a thing 's to be done you do it . This morning we all went to pieces . You took charge . You and Jim . " " And if we 'd gone to pieces someone else  --  you  --  or Jennie or Delia  --  would have taken over . People rise to the occasion , Spike , when they 're needed . "  | We heard the outer door bang . We heard George 's voice , singing , " I 'll be all smiles tonight , love , I 'll be all smiles tonight . ' . . . Hi-ho , Delia ! What are you doing ? Ah . . . baking ! You 're lovely , my dear , with your flushed cheeks . Where are my friends ? I have presents  --  good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , my God , he is oiled . " He looked very jaunty . His hat was cocked to one side , his arms loaded with bundles . " I have brought liquid refreshment for all . Even little Peggy . I thought of her , and I brought her a bottle of Seven Up . Oh  --  shh ! She 's sleeping . Come on , everyone , drink up . " We did n't sit back and wait for a second invitation . He was n't noisy after that first outburst , but he was very talkative . " I had a fine time , " he said . " I talked to a lot of people . I found out what is wrong with the country . I bought a girl a drink . She was cute . She wanted me to go to a rollerskating rink with her , but I told her I could n't skate . It shocked her no end . She said , Imagine getting to your age and not knowing how to skate . What do you do in your spare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do ? Nothing . I should have a purpose in life . " " Shut up , George . Here 's another drink . " I never have been able to drink in a ladylike manner . I ca n't sit quietly in a chair and drink . I have to be active , and I always get tight practically immediately . That night was the exception . I do n't know why . Some physical or mental idiosyncrasy of the moment , perhaps . After my first one I thought , Heck , this stuff is mild . " Fix me another , Spike . " No dizziness , no fogginess . Like drinking soda water lightly flavored with bourbon . They coaxed Jim to play the piano . He said he would later . They turned on the radio . I danced with Spike . I asked Jim to dance with me . He shook his head . It all came back to me then . He was sitting beside the bookcase where the flashlights were kept .  | From that time things went on . I guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me of not , but it was as though there was a second person within me , watching , cataloguing , realizing . And the thing that I 'd been fighting ever since they all came back descended on me . Full force . No holds barred . There it was in all its naked ugliness . How it feels to be in the same room with a murderer . No one can possibly know who has n't felt it . And I have no words to describe how it was . There was the time at school when we 'd discovered we had a thief in the house and could n't find out for some time who it was . That was bad , because you 'd find yourself suspecting everyone and being afraid that someone was suspecting you . But this  --  this was n't a matter of losing a pin , of finding that two dollars was missing from your purse , of being careful not to leave rings or wrist watches in the bathroom . And a lot of those girls were strangers to me . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be thieves . It 's a terrific blow to suspect people you like of murder . Justified or not . And who is to say that it is justified ? Yeah , I could see the other nine commandments broken without a quiver . Well , some of them , with a small quiver . But  --  thou shalt not kill  --  that was something else again . It ran in my head  --  thou shalt not kill , thou shalt not kill ... Who , in the middle of the night , had violated those words ? It was the first I 'd realized that Jim was playing the piano . The words went along with his music . I went over to him . I whispered , " I thought you were watching the place where the flashlights were kept . " He looked at me with a bleak expression . " I guess I forgot . I guess it was a bad idea in the first place . " But he got up pretty soon from the piano . He said , " I 'm going upstairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the room did n't abate a particle . But I watched him walking slowly over to the wall . He leaned down , reached into the  | shelf , straightened up . There was a flashlight in his hand . He looked at me , his face white . He stooped down , put the flashlight back . It was George who said , " Changed your mind , Jim ? " It made me shiver . George was the one who had noticed . Jim laughed . " I remembered . I have one . " George drawled slowly , " Well , go ahead , blow your nose ? or whatever . " It could n't be George . Not because I liked him . I liked all of them . But George  --  no , he 'd have strangled her . He 'd not have planned it . He 'd have struck her in a fit of anger . He 'd have been overcome and killed her in anger and hate  --  or love , but he 'd not have sneaked those flashlights out , sneaked Mister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawings , drawings that proved he 'd not been as through with her as he 'd made her think . There was still feeling enough so that he could make the horrible pictures . The way he played bridge . Taking tremendous chances , playing with a sheer , unbelievable intuition . A murderer could play bridge like that . I might be wrong about his anger . It might be the kind that would grow within him . He had a logical mind . There was the way he had argued at the breakfast table . I could see his mind going toward the inevitability of what had to be done  --  and doing it the way it would cause the least trouble . We put Peg in on Delia 's and Bernard 's bed . Delia said , " I think she should sleep down here with me tonight . " The poor child was so groggy she let Delia and me undress her as though she 'd been three years old , and when we covered her up she snuggled her head into the pillow and slept soundly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lucky , lucky Peg . I feel as though I could never sleep again , Jennie . " She sat down on the boudoir chair , rested her head on her hand . " I must have done something awful sometime in my life to have such things happen to me. "  | I pulled up the dressing-table bench . " Do n't talk like that , Delia . Do n't even think like that . You 're as bad as Mother Parry , with her predestination . " Did she pay any attention to me ? No . I was glad I was the only one to hear her words . " I thought if she were dead everything would be solved . I thought  --  with her out of the way , Bernard would come back to me . . .. " I leaned forward . " What do you mean , Delia , you thought if she were dead ? " Like a person in a trance , or like a very drunk person , she said , " I thought last night  --  if only Margot were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'd taken two sleeping tablets . Delia had been drugged , she could n't have climbed the ladder . Simple  --  to shoot that full of holes . She might not have taken them . She could have fooled Mother Parry and me . The best argument , however , was that she would n't be talking like this if she had . Except that she was n't in her right mind . Even innocent , she would n't ordinarily have talked like this . Like a person driven to put it into words . Blood-chilling , to hear the calmness of her voice . " Now I see that her being dead does n't help a bit . He 's gone from me . " " Oh , Delia , no ! " " You do n't know , Jennie . You see , now " ? shc smiled ? " now he 's proved his virility . Ah  --  yes  --  he 'll be a " ? it was queer to hear Delia using slang ? " Bernard will be a sucker for the next female that looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole thing . She lost him herself , but she also lost him to me . " I began to think it was time to try to stop her . I said , " Delia , you 're overwrought . You 're not seeing things clearly . I 'm afraid , darling , you 're being melodramatic . " She took a deep breath . " Such a struggle , Jennie . It just means that I have to keep on fighting . You start out  --  excited , happy  --  you 've found the man you love , and strangely enough ,  | he loves you too . Everything 's going to be wonderful . Then by some damn quirk of nature your love is denied . Little did I think " ? she looked down at the two rings on her left hand ? " little did I think when these came to me what they would mean . Sorrow and bleakness  --  fighting to keep a man to you ? and death  --  " Oh , Lord . I stood up . " Come on , Delia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward , her hands hanging limp over her knees , she said , " That office . Day after day after day . A working wife . A career woman . Fondling steel filing cabinets  --  one half of your mind on your job , the other half thinking up things to make your married life interesting . " She raised her head sharply . " Did you say a drink ? Let 's have a drink  --  quickly . " They were playing some kind of a game , all of them squatting in the middle of the floor . Mother Parry was sleeping quietly in her chair . Once in a while she 'd jerk awake , look over the room , then go back to sleep . I never did find out the name of the game . Something like " Dog Eat Dog . " You slapped cards down and you yelled and you bet pennies . I won fifteen cents . I got tired sitting on the floor and quit . Spike objected , " No fair , no fair . Ca n't leave the game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nuts , " and sat down on a comfortable chair . No one even thought of going to bed . We were like a bunch of monkeys in a cage . No one left the living room , except to go to the bathroom . No matter how crazy a thing anybody thought up , we 'd do it . I thought , Sooner or later we 're going to run down . People will begin passing out , we 'll get sleepy , we 'll be exhausted . But it did n't happen . All of us hung together in a crazy alcoholic excitement , keeping from thinking . My mind was as bad as the room . Murder . . . murder ... thou shalt not kill . . . darkness and a girl creeping up a ladder ... someone lying in wait to hear her fall ... someone ... They would have to step over her sprawled body to  | get the cat down . Twice  --  going up and coming down , stepping over the slender , still-warm body , holding the cat . In the darkness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Touching me , talking to me , laughing , drinking ? while down in the village undertaking parlor Margot was lying . Did they really lie on slabs ? It was n't right . An eye for an eye , a tooth for a tooth , a life for a life . Thou shalt not kill . The law of Moses and the prophets . " He that smiteth a man , so that he die , shall be surely put to death . " I noticed when it was a quarter after one . I had to realize that , twenty-four hours before , Margot was driving up to the house , talking to Bernard , or perhaps sitting with her head on his shoulder , half asleep . Sure of herself . She had what she wanted . She was going to be married . She 'd won . She 'd fought Delia and won . Not only Delia , but Spike and George and the other men who 'd found her out and left her . Yes , the world must have been a fairly pleasant place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what was lying in wait for her . Not ever know about the long-haired sandy cat sitting at the top of the ladder , twitching his tail back and forth in the darkness . She would n't be frightened to discover there was n't a flashlight . It would n't occur to her to be afraid . She 'd walk through the black hallway , up the stairs , over to the ladder . She might even be humming . Was there someone there besides the cat to hear ? Was there someone to realize that in a few minutes the long slim lovely legs would be sprawled out . . . ? One-thirty . I had turned over in my bed and looked at the clock . Twenty-four hours before , a neck had been broken . . . . I could hear Spike 's words as plainly as though he were saying them again , " What can you do , Jennie , about Margot ? Besides breaking her God-damned neck ? " The room swirled , turned around me . I held hard to the arms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was saying ,  | " Got you , George . Full house . " Spike approved , " Good for you , Delia , he 's getting too big a pile in front of him . " Bernard asked , " My deal , is it ? O.K. , ante in  --  a chip apiece . This is gon na be seven-card stud  --  deuces and one-eyed jacks wild . Everybody in ? " I counted the panes in the windows . I thought about walking down Sixty-third Street . There was a man standing in front of the drugstore . He was wearing a heavy overcoat , but he did n't look as though he were going anywhere . Papers were swirling around in the wind under the elevated tracks . There was a woman getting out of a taxi . I thought about the Midway in the spring , Dorothy saying to me , " And he 's going to write a novel about the university and the theme is Where will they find the sons of bitches to fill their God-damned empty niches ? " We thought it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the niches in the gray buildings and repeat what he 'd said . I tried to think of redecorating my apartment , if I had lots of money . I fell back to thinking of the farm , finally . They 'd all be in bed now  --  Dad and Mother  --  not knowing what was happening to me . There 'd be a letter when I got back to the apartment . It would say that Dad 's new mare had foaled ; that Montgomery was getting so old he had trouble getting around ; that Dad was having difficulty finding a new hired man because of the defense plants . I went through my own home in my mind . I walked into every room , and out to the barn . I had thought of taking Spike down there . Dad would like him . We 'd ride together  --  he on Dad 's own big gelding . We 'd go out to the stables in the morning , we 'd sit on the top rail of the fence and watch the horses capering in the fresh morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd go down to the village . I 'd take him to meet Aunt Hattie and Zelna , and the old blacksmith who told me stories when I was a kid . I 'd show him the cemetery on the farm for our horses and dog . I 'd planned that he would sleep in Dave 's room , up under the eaves .  | How could I now ? How could I see him sitting in the big kitchen talking to Mother and the hired girl ? It was n't Spike . Spike would n't do a thing like that , even if he thought it would be good . Not loving life the way he did . He would n't take life from someone else . He might think it should be done . As he 'd said to Mother Parry .. . Mother Parry . I looked over at her . Her head was bent to one side , her hands quiet in her lap . He had said , " When a thing 's to be done , you do it . " This might be to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Delia and Bernard were everything in the world to her . She 'd kill an animal that menaced them  --  she 'd give her own life for their happiness . Why not another person 's ? Why not ? She hated Margot to begin with . What was it Margot had said to George about its being difficult to talk in the house without Mother Parry listening ? She could have heard Bernard and Delia talking . She could have been crouched at the bedroom door , she could have heard about Margot 's being pregnant , about Bernard 's leaving Delia ... . It was hard to accept . I thought of my own mother  --  of her killing . No . Still , they said mothers would do anything for their children . I wished I 'd yelled when I heard Margot fall . I 'd have known then whether or not Mother Parry was in the bedroom . I 'd only assumed she was there sleeping . My head was beginning to ache . Mother Parry stirred , wakened , looked at the group on the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed , " she said . Everyone yelled good night . I watched her walking into the bedroom . She was an old , old woman . She could n't have . To go to church in the morning and to murder that night . . . no . I set my empty glass down and stretched out on the couch , shut my eyes . It was no to all of them , but one of them had . Someone besides Jim and me . But wait a minute . I opened my eyes . Jim . I was a fool . It  | was Jim who 'd destroyed the evidence . It was Jim I 'd caught pulling the hairs out of the boards . Why should he kill her , though ? There might be a reason . Who knew what there 'd been between him and Margot ? I remembered the way he had played the piano for her ... . I could hear Mother Parry in the bedroom , " Here , Mister , here , Mister . " She came to the door , stuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come . Where do you suppose he is ? " Bernard laughed . " Aw , Mother , let him have a night out . He 's probably dating that silver Persian down on the beach . " " But he always comes when I call . " " You 'll hear him later , Mother . He 'll come meowing when you 're sound asleep . " She shut the bedroom door . They stopped playing poker . They got up off the floor and sat in chairs . They told a few dirty jokes . But they were all restive , wanting something else to do . It was Bernard who got the idea . " Wonder where that cat is ? " Delia said , " I hope he 's all right . I hope he is n't caught somewhere . " I did n't care if I never saw him again . Bernard got up . " I think I 'll go out and scout around . " " Let 's all go . We can spread out and hunt , " Jim suggested . Spike jumped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could do with some fresh air . " They made a great to-do over it . They kept talking , as they got into jackets , about how they 'd circle around ? " You go this way ; I 'll go in the direction of the Hallowells ' " ? making definite , careful plans . The cat was almost forgotten in the excitement of getting out , of having something to do . They wanted us to go with them , but Delia said she was tired , and I said I was n't going to go out there and roam around in the bushes with all kinds of wild animals waiting to jump at me.  | It was awfully quiet after they 'd gone . Delia was in the bathroom undressing . I sat there for a while alone , not thinking . The room was thick with smoke . It was hot . The playing cards were in a rumpled heap in the middle of the floor . I went over and picked up the cards , separated the poker chips , and put them in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't help much . I started collecting the dirty glasses and ash trays to take them to the kitchen . My headache was getting worse . My eyes were burning from the smoke . My mouth tasted awful . Suddenly I wanted to go out too . I set the glasses down on the kitchen sink , went to the closet , and grabbed Delia 's dark sport coat , called to her that I was going out for a breath of air . It was beautiful outside . Quiet . I walked around the house to the lake side , stood there with my back against the brick . I could n't make out the lake . It was too dark . To the west I could see the light of the Gary mills making the sky red . It was a comforting sight . Gave me the feeling of men working , of lives going on peacefully , calmly , of people sleeping heavily in their beds . Stars were bright . I looked up at them , trying to pick out the ones I knew . My hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my head to get it loose  --  and I saw the light out of the corner of my eye . I turned my head slowly . Someone was standing still , deathly still , in the darkness . Over in the bushes to my right . I held my breath . The light I had seen was the end of a cigarette . It brightened , dulled . I could smell the smoke now . I never even thought of calling out . I do n't think I could have if I 'd wanted to . Did he know I was there ? The same blind , unreasoning fear that I 'd felt the night before . Evil . That was it . I could feel it . Nonsense . Maybe . But I started creeping along the house , as though I were being pursued , as though I were escaping from something . My step was sure , I made no sound . I was as quiet as that figure . But when I got around the corner of the house I ran , gasping for breath ,  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shut it carefully behind me , and stood , my back against it , trying to get my breath . I was shaking now , all over . Delia called from the bedroom , " Is that you , Jennie ? " I answered her . I said , " Yes , Delia . " " Good night , dear , " she said . I hurried into the living room , rushed over and closed the window , and collapsed on the couch . I could hardly light a cigarette , I was shaking so . The fear died down slowly . I started rationalizing . Why in hell had I been so scared ? It was probably Bernard or Spike or Jim or George standing there smoking , quiet because they had n't seen me . The whole thing had been so unreasoning on my part . I should have said , " Hi there " or " Fancy meeting you here , " and whoever it was would have turned and said , " Oh , Jennie ! Thought you were afraid of the dark , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But in spite of my rationalizing I could n't lose the feeling that there was something sinister , something wrong with the figure waiting there in the darkness . I got up and put Delia 's coat away . I 'd have to watch myself . I was being unutterably silly . Spike had told the sheriff I was an imaginative girl . Apparently I was , to the extent of being completely unintelligent , completely ridiculous . It did n't do any good to call myself harsh names . It did n't do any good to figure out that the reason I 'd been frightened was because it was naturally a shock to discover that someone  --  anyone  --  was standing a few feet away from you and you 'd been unaware of it . But the thing I could n't understand  --  if it had been one of the four men , why would n't I have known ? I had the craziest idea that some sixth sense or other would have told me . It was then I thought of the sheriff . Could it be possible that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspicious ? Or even that he 'd not been suspicious but that he 'd put a man to watch  | to see that none of us left before the inquest ? That did n't seem reasonable . It would explain , however , my awful feeling that it was someone strange . I hoped not . I 'd have hated to have any of the sheriff 's men , unless he was a very understanding person , see through the window our drunken party . Not that it 'd been any bacchanalian revel , but we had n't acted as a group sorrowing for the death of one of its members . Conventional sorrowing , anyway . I could n't find any more cigarettes . I hunted and hunted . The more I hunted the more desperately I wanted one . I was sorry I 'd emptied the ash trays  --  there might have been a butt long enough to smoke . I almost danced up and down with glee when I found a carton on the lower shelf of the bookcase . I lit one and drew a long , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The whole business could be settled as soon as the men came back . I 'd ask them who 'd stood in the bushes at the northeast corner of the house and smoked a cigarette . They 'd be amused when I told them how frightened I 'd been . Jim would say , " If you are n't the darnedest scaredy-cat . " I turned on the radio , very low , and listened  --  along with the taxi drivers , the countermen in all-night restaurants , the people coming home from parties ... . Bernard came in first . He said , " Well , Jennie , are you still up ? Either of those three lugs come in yet ? " " Nope . Were n't you with them ? " " Oh , we all separated . Tracking down our quarry , so to speak . Only we did n't . " " You did n't find the cat ? " " I did n't . At least , I 'm pretty sure he 's not anywhere near . " He sat down . " Boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more softly now , but he let the door slam behind him . " I 'll be all smiles , tonight , love , I 'll be all smiles . ' . . . Well , well , little Jennie . Where 's your boy  | friend , kid ? Lost ? Lost in an impenetrable forest ? Look what I did . Look . Look at that . " His trouser leg was slashed . " Damned brambles . " He pulled up the trouser leg ; his skin was crisscrossed with scratches . " Well  --  George  --  your hand too . " " Yeah . " He held it out . " I got mad at the damn bush and it put me in my place in short order . " Jim came in next , very quietly . " No cat . No cat anywhere around . " He yawned . " He 'll turn up in the morning , no doubt , with a self-satisfied grin on his face  --  the beast . " I got to wondering about Spike . " You do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he knows this territory as well as I do . " Jim stretched . " Well , if he 's lost , he 's lost . He can wander around for days in circles and I wo n't care . At least , now I do n't . " We all sat there . I was glad when I heard the door open . " Anybody find him ? I did n't . " He sat down beside me , put his arm around me . All right . Now was my chance . They were all here . I could come out with my question . I did n't . I sat there , tense , conscious of Spike 's arm , conscious of how they all looked  --  drawn , haggard , tired  --  and I could n't say the words . I do n't know why . Such simple words , but my tongue could n't form them . George stood up . " Well , let 's hit the hay . " Spike said , " Go on , you guys , make yourselves scarce for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properly to little Jennie . " Bernard went into the bathroom . George and Jim started upstairs . Spike 's voice was low . " What 's the matter , Jennie ? Do n't you like me any more ? " I tried to smile at him . I said , " Spike , I 'm so tired  --  all I can think of is collapsing in bed . And I smell bad  --  smoke and whisky . . . " " O.K. , honey . " He kissed my neck , he held me against him  | for an instant . " Good night , darling . I love you . " He let go of me suddenly and ran up the stairs . I stood there for a minute , alone , and walked into the bedroom . I took off my shoes and stockings and dress , and crawled into bed . Too much trouble to hunt for my pajamas . . . too much trouble . . . Tuesday Morning MOTHER PARRY 'S ALARM CLOCK wakened me . I watched her scuttle out of bed , turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her clothes , and went into the bathroom . I was wide awake . I thought when I went to bed that I 'd never wake up again . It was eight o'clock . The sun was shining in the window . I was ashamed when I realized I 'd slept in my underwear . So sloppy . And my stockings  --  they were thrown over the dressing table . I threw back the covers , sat on the edge of the bed . There was something I had to do . It must have come to me during the night in that heavy sleep . Dreamless , I thought . Or perhaps I 'd dreamed what I was about to do . Mother Parry came back into the room . " Jennie , child , did I waken you ? " " I wanted to get up . " " I 'm going out now and make some coffee and you and I will have breakfast . I think we 'd better let the others sleep as long as possible . " That 's what I wanted . I hurried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have any more clean with me ; I 'd have to wear the ones I 'd come out in . I put on a robe , went through the living room to the bathroom . Bernard was sprawled on the  | couch , a blanket over him . He was sleeping heavily , snoring . He had n't undressed at all . I took a cold shower and dressed in my sweater and skirt . I 'd change before we had to go to the inquest . Mother Parry had bacon and toast and coffee ready . She 'd pulled out the breakfast bar and the two of us sat on the stools and ate our breakfast . " I hope , " she said , " they wo n't bother Peg too much . It will be awful for her to go back over all that . I 'm just afraid she 'll go into hysterics again . I wish they would n't question her . " " She may surprise us , Mother Parry . She may be quite all right . " " I hope so . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I think he 'll make it as easy as possible for all of us . " " I wonder " ? I lit a cigarette as she refilled my cup ? " I wonder how it will be ? What we 'll have to do . " " I expect Jim or Spike can tell us . I 'd like to know , too , before we go over . " " Where do we go ? " " I do n't know . The sheriff said he 'd come here this morning . " She got up . " I want to brush up a bit in the living room . I 'd hate to have him see it in the condition it 's in now . " " I 'm going for a little walk , Mother Parry . I 'll wash these dishes when I come back . " " Oh , we 'll just let them go until everybody 's had breakfast . I wonder where Mister is ? " " They went out hunting for him last night . " " They did ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Well , I expect he 'll come home when he 's good and ready . " I rinsed the dishes and stacked them . Now that I could go , I was in no hurry to start . I got my jacket , tied a woolen scarf around my head , opened the door . Cold . Bright . Almost like the morning Spike and I had walked , except that it was colder . I started around the house .  | There were my footprints from last night . I turned the corner . A lake boat on the horizon sent off a line of black smoke . Someone was down on the beach . Smoke was coming from the Hallowells ' chimney . I walked along , close to the house . There was where I had stood . The sand was mussed . I stood in the same spot and looked to my right . Bushes , trees  --  the hill sloping down . From where I stood I could see that the sand was mussed over there too . I knew definitely that I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parted the bushes . I did n't know what I was doing now . I 'd wanted to make sure that someone had been there . I knew that . What else was I looking for ? There were two or three cigarette stubs . He 'd evidently stood there for some time . If anyone saw me from the house they 'd think I was crazy . I looked back . A direct line to the window in Mother Parry 's room . A direct line , cleared of small plants , as though it were a kind of trail . But yes  --  yes , of course , Mister Blister 's trail . Yes . You could see bits of his sandy fur on the branches . Lord knows what made me do it . That sixth sense I 'd been thinking about last night ? Here I was tramping , scrambling through the undergrowth , not knowing why . When I saw the sand piled up under the heavy bush I was n't surprised . As though I 'd found what I was looking for . I hesitated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had to be sure that what I thought was true . I looked around , but I could n't see anything to use . I dropped down . The sand was cold on my knees . My good pigskin gloves . Tearing at the damp sand , pushing it away , digging . I did n't have to go too far . My hand touched something soft . I carefully pulled away sand without touching the softness again . His fur was almost the same color as the sand . I was there for a long time on my knees looking at the patch of fur It was awful . I do n't know how I did it , but I uncovered him  | entirely . I wanted to know how . Apparently he 'd been strangled . There was no mark on him  --  no blow on his head  --  no blood . Someone had squeezed the soft neck until he was dead . I started covering him up again furiously . I did a better job than that other person . I scraped the spot down with my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careful not to leave any footsteps . Through the bushes again . They tore at my hair , at the woolen scarf . I came out in the clear and stood looking out over the lake . Tuesday morning ? nine o'clock . Ordinarily I 'd be over in that line of buildings on the horizon . I 'd be sitting down at my desk opening the mail , wondering whether my boss would be in a good humor this morning or a bad one . My hair would be freshly washed , I 'd be thinking about going to the movies with Spike . Katie would be calling me to ask me to meet her for lunch . I 'd be wanting to tell her about Spike . None of that . Instead I was standing on the top of a sand dune  --  sick , horrified , at the killing of a cat . I had to go back into the house . I had to go back and not let any of them see , not let anyone know what I 'd found . Steel my face not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mister Blister be ? " I stripped off my gloves , dropped them to the sand , and covered them up . My queasy stomach started acting up again when I stepped into the house . They were all there , just beginning to gather around the breakfast table . I walked right into the bathroom and threw up the breakfast I 'd eaten . Went out to the table and , illogically enough , sat down and ate another one . Bodies are funny . Sometimes they seem all tied up with what 's happening to you ; and other times they get hungry , demanding , when your mind says you ca n't stand the sight of food . Anyway , I sat there and ate right along with the rest of them . Except George . George was ill  --  violently ill . " As usual , " Spike said . He wandered around . He drank black coffee . Poor Delia had to hunt and hunt to find tomato juice for him . He was a  | horrible color  --  a greenish-gray  --  and he kept moaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heaven 's name does n't someone stop me ? No one should suffer as I 'm suffering . I lose my head after three drinks . Three drinks  --  and from then on , I 'll put anything down . I had gin at that joint . Gin ! " Bernard said , " Take some aspirin , George . " " I 've already had six of the things . I can feel them  --  all six of them lying in my stomach . When I move they roll around . " He 'd call to us from the living room , " How you can eat ! Greasy bacon , greasy eggs . . . " Peg was sharp . " Shut up , George . Do n't spoil it for the rest of us . Because you have n't any will power . " He moaned . " Will power . That 's what I need . Will power . If you guys were my friends you 'd have stopped me last night . You know what I go through . You should n't have let me have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yeah . " Spike did n't wait to swallow his mouthful . " Yeah , we 've tried that before , if you 'll recall . And you 've acted like a madman . You can suffer your hangover  --  sooner than have one of us be throttled for denying you drink when you 're in your cups . " Throttled . George 's hands had been scratched . By the bramble bushes , he said . As the breath was squeezed out of Mister he might have struck out with his paws . I tried to make my voice sound natural . " How are your hands , George ? " Two or three people at the table said , " I lands ? " George said , " What do you mean  --  my hands ? " " They were all scratched up when you came in last night . " Bernard remembered . " That 's right , he did tangle up with a bush . " I could see George holding his hands up , looking at them . " Why , they 're all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm sure . Do n't , Jennie , take my mind off my stomach and my bead . They 're enough to worry about . "  | " Such wicked scratches " ? I put jelly on the last bit of toast ? " such wicked scratches for a bush to make . " " We have some wicked bushes out here , Jennie . " Mother Parry poured more coffee in Jim 's cup . " Awful thorns . I meant to tell you this morning when you started out to put on socks instead of your silk hose , but I forgot . " I pushed back my chair . I had n't thought about my stockings . They were ruined . Runs and catches . I had n't even noticed . There were scratches on my legs too . Bernard said quietly , " You must have walked through the bushes . We do have fairly well-defined trails , you know . " " I guess maybe I did . " Was he looking at me strangely ? Or did I imagine that ? After breakfast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putting the ham into the oven , I had to listen to Mother Parry standing at the back door . " Here , Mister , come on , Mister . " She 'd whistle . " Here , Mister . " She 'd walk back into the house . " I ca n't imagine where he could have gone to . This is n't like him at all . He always comes back in the morning for a drink of milk . Always . " Everybody started getting dressed . I was n't surprised when I saw Jim start out the door with Peg . Coaching again . Getting her story all set for her . Before the sheriff came . She was pale when she came back , but very calm . I was the only one in the living room . Jim sat down at the piano , started playing . He called to me , " Come here , Jennie . " I went over and stood beside the piano . He said , " Sit down , " and he slid over on the bench . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them ? " " Oh sure . " I started playing " Chopsticks . " " Now , now , none of that , Jennie . There was that arrangement we had of At Sundown : " It came back to me . We were playing along together when he whispered , ' What were you inferring at the table about the scratches ? "  | I kept right on with the music . " Someone strangled Mister Blister last night . I found him this morning . " A few extra flurries in his music . " How did you happen to find him ? " Well , if he had done it , I 'd tell him how I 'd found the cat . " He was inexpertly buried . I dug him up . " " You dug him up ? " His music stopped , then started again . " My God , why did you do that ? " " I buried him again . Only better . I covered the place over with dead leaves . I messed up the footprints . " My voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at covering up somebody 's killings . " He stopped playing . " I knew someone would do it . I wanted to myself . I hated the sight of him after what happened . " Go ahead and talk . I started playing " Narcissus . " One of the few pieces I remember . I played it in a recital once . Go ahead and talk . I 'll not believe a word you say . How do I know you 're not covering up for yourself ? How do I know who  --  whom to believe ? Somebody had murdered . The rest of us were hiding it . We were murderers , too , because we were condoning it . We all knew it had happened . In the sight of God we were as guilty as the person who 'd climbed the ladder . In the sight of God ? what was I thinking ? God did n't enter into it . The sheriff . The sheriff and the forces of law and order . More than that  --  our own belief in what was right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jennie playing the piano . Congratulations , Jennie , I thought it was Jim . " Spike was all dressed up . Jim was disgruntled . " My God , if you think I 'd play ' Nar-cissus ' ! " " What 's wrong with Narcissus ' ? " I kept right on . " Go ahead , Jennie , go ahead . Do n't mind me . Only I want you to realize that I become a violent man at the sound of In a Country Garden . ' I bite people who play it , I tear out their hair by the roots . "  | " O.K. , O.K. " I stopped . I was so tired I did n't see how I could get through the rest of the day . I wanted to sit in a corner and cry . I wanted to be a million miles from here . I wanted to be down on the farm  --  bored at having to sit through a meeting of Mother 's sewing circle . I wanted to hear her voice . I wanted to hear Dad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight , Jennie , you 're looking poorly . " I was so homesick I thought I could n't stand it . These were strangers . I wanted no more to do with them . But I was one of them . No getting away from it now  --  ever . The sheriff 's voice interrupted my thoughts . " Good morning , Mrs. Parry , good morning . Lovely morning , is n't it ? " He was dressed up too . His blond hair shone , his teeth flashed at all of us . What if I were to say , " She was murdered , you know . " What if I were to say that ? That 'd take the grin off his face . He would n't think it was such a lovely day . I felt the couch sink as Spike sat down beside me . He took hold of my hand . He held it tightly , warmly , in his . One of them . Yes , I was one of them . Now and forever . I felt as though I were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real to me , and that only . It was bony and a little damp . Once in a while I 'd take mine away from it , wipe the palm on my skirt , and take hold of his again quickly . The others were acting a scene for me . I had heard every speech before it was made , I already knew each gesture . Like a dress rehearsal . Everyone running through their parts automatically . They needed an audience , they needed the lift of the first-night audience to put life in the scene they 'd been practicing for weeks . I could tell when they introduced the sheriff to Peg that he had a kid sister  --  the way he talked to her , the kindness , the consideration in his look . She sat in a straight chair , her hands down at her sides holding on to the seat of the chair , her feet , pathetic in the soiled saddle shoes , pigeon-toed.  | He did n't call her Miss Van Meter . When he asked her to tell him just what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awake , " she said , " and I looked at my watch . It was five-thirty . I remembered that Mother Parry was going to call us all at six so we could get dressed and eat and start to the city . Margot always smokes a cigarette before she gets out of bed . I thought I 'd go up to her room and waken her and talk while she was smoking . I put on my slippers and my robe and went out into the hall . " She stopped . Spike was holding my hand so tightly my ring was cutting my finger . " The hall was almost dark . I was hurrying . I did n't look down . I stumbled over something and fell . " Her even recital did not hesitate . " I realized I 'd fallen on somebody . I saw it was Margot . I thought she 'd got up and had fainted . I touched her face . " She looked directly at the sheriff . " I knew she was dead . I never saw a dead person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She looked away from him at all of us . " I do n't know from then on . . . . I remember Mother Parry putting me to bed . I remember waking up . Jim and Jennie were there . " " The last time you saw her alive was the night before ? " " Yes , " and she smiled . " I was in bed and she came in to say good night to me . We talked for a while before she went up to her room . We were going to have lunch together next week . " " Did she say anything about not feeling well ? " Peg 's eyes blazed . " Margot was never sick . Never . She prided herself on never being sick . " The sheriff turned to Bernard . " But you said she told you she had a headache  --  " Bernard said in a tired voice , " That 's what she told me . " It was as though he 'd insulted Margot . Peg looked at him , wide-eyed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have said that . She always said , " and she repeated , her eyes shining , " Never admit your weaknesses . If you 're scared or frightened , do n't let anyone know , and you 'll lose your fear . ' That 's what she said . And if her head had been splitting , she 'd not have let anyone know , "  | " Peg darling . " Delia was leaning forward . She looked demure , sweet  --  I could imagine the sheriff thinking , Now there 's the kind of a wife a man should have ? " Peg , you have n't known Margot as long as we have . She was giving you good advice . She wanted to help you get over being young and shy . " Peg started to cry . Quietly . " I ca n't stand her being dead . What will I do now ? " The sheriff looked a bit confused . He asked Delia , " Had Peg just met her ? " Peg answered him . " I 'd known her a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she never paid any attention to me . Until this week end . She told me she 'd always thought of me as a kid . She had n't realized I 'd grown up . We were going to be friends . She was beautiful . Everyone was crazy about her , but she picked me out . She was going to help me buy my clothes and fix my hair . She said I had wonderful possibilities . And now she 's dead . What am I going to do ? " The sheriff rose nobly . " She would n't want you to cry , Peg . She 'd want you to go on being brave , as she was brave . " Peg wiped her eyes . " She was the bravest person I ever knew . Only one thing she was afraid of  --  cats . I used to protect her from Mister Blister . " " Mister Blister ? " He really was confused . " Mother Parry 's cat . She was so afraid of him , and I used to watch to see that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't breathe so heavily . I was afraid Delia was going to faint . Her face was as white as the frill at her neck . The sheriff lit a cigarette . " I ca n't understand anyone 's being afraid of cats . " Peg explained , " Oh , but this was a phobia . She could n't help it . " " But how was she afraid ? Did she think he 'd bite her or scratch her or what ? " Mother Parry cleared her throat . " Margot , Sheriff Thompson ,  | was a very fastidious person . She thought cats carried germs . She felt the same way about dogs . They were dirty animals to her , and she did n't like to be touched by them , or to have them near her . " " Well " ? the sheriff looked apologetically at Peg , but went right ahead ? " I never could understand people who do n't like dogs . Never felt as though you could trust them , somehow . I 've got three of them . Half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his notebook out of his pocket , opened it . " Well , I guess I 've got everything . The coroner will probably  --  " Mother Parry spoke again . " Could you tell us , Sheriff Thompson , just what will happen at the inquest ? What we 'll have to do ? " He smiled . " You know , it 's always a surprise to me , when something like this happens , to realize how little people generally know about the procedure to be followed . 1 'd say , looking at you people , that you 're pretty much above average , and yet none of you seems to know what has to be done  --  or why . " I answered him . " We so seldom have occasion to come into contact with those procedures . Death by  --  accident  --  or design ? is a bit out of the ken of our experience . " George said surprisingly , " I used to serve on coroners ' juries . " " You did ? " " Yeah . I was a newspaperman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to earn a couple of dollars when you were broke . " Delia asked quickly , " Will there be a jury ? " " No . " The sheriff smiled again . " No , there are no coroners ' juries in this state . What it is , really , is a way for the coroner to get everyone 's testimony into the records  --  under oath . " Under oath . It had a fearsome sound to it . Mother Parry asked again , " But what will we have to do ? " " Simply tell , as you 've told me , what happened . The body has to be identified . The deceased 's uncle , Mr. " ? he looked at his notes ? " Mr. Henry Spendler , is coming out to take care of  | that . " He closed the notebook . " I 'd better be getting back to town . I 'd like to meet his train . " " Where will the inquest be ? " " Oh yes , I should have told you that . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us must have spoken . A chorus of " Undertaking parlors ! " He seemed surprised at our unanimous reaction . " Yes , yes , of course . " " But how awful ! " Delia 's hands were twisting . " How awful ! I thought it would be in a courtroom . " " What difference does it make ? " He stood up . Before he went out he walked over to Peg . He patted her shoulder . He said , " Keep a stiff upper lip , kid . " She smiled at him . " I will . " And then , inconsequentially , she asked , " How did you get to be a sheriff ? Do you wear a badge ? " " I was elected . " " Can anybody get to be a sheriff ? " " Well , yes , but I worked for it , Peg . I wanted to be a sheriff . I studied . Fingerprinting and crime detection . " There was awe in her voice . He liked it . She said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many murderers and things ? " He laughed . " Not much chance in my territory , kid . Just routine stuff . I have n't had an opportunity to test most of my theoretical knowledge . " " You mean  --  like fingerprints and ballistics and motives  --  " He grinned at her . " You do read ' em , do n't you ? " " Oh yes . Do you ? I 've always wondered whether policemen and detectives ever read them . They always make fun of the forces of law and order . " " Well , it makes it more exciting if an amateur discovers the murderer . Actually , I think , it 's the dull routine of the police officer that tracks down most criminals . Then , too , crime usually occurs not in the best-regulated circles , as our mystery  | writers would have us believe but in our criminal group  --  our underworld . We know them , we know the marks they leave , and why they do things . It 's just like anything else . People with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not steal , are not inclined to murder . They have other ways of settling their difficulties . " George was lighting his pipe . " 1 'd quibble with you on that , Sheriff . Our instincts are basically the same , regardless of our backgrounds , how we were brought up , our training ? 2 ' " Now wait a minute . Take , for example , Miss Simpson here . If she 'd been reared below the tracks in an atmosphere of dirt and squalor and hunger  --  shunted out when she was fifteen or sixteen to earn her living by whatever means were open to her , she might very likely have started out in an unsavory tavern . Things that to her as she is now would he unspeakable might , in the other case , be matters of course . She 'd accept fighting and stealing and killing as a part merely of the business of existing . As it is , because she was reared in a different atmosphere , those things are alien to her . " " Ah . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exponent of environment overcoming heredity . " The sheriff was smug . " No argument there at all . " Maybe the sheriff irked George , maybe lie did n't like his air of assurance , but I caught my breath at his next remark : " You do n't believe , either , I suppose , in the perfect crime ? the undiscovered crime . " The sheriff did n't answer for what seemed an awfully long time . " There are more unsolved crimes than we like to admit . As far as the perfect crime is concerned , by which I suppose you mean the murderer who is never found , never accused of his crime , there is this to be said . " He stamped out his cigarette . " Every murderer leaves a mark of some kind or other . You ca n't commit murder and not leave something that would convict you of that murder . Unfortunately " ? and he smiled ? " the investigator does not always find the mark you 've left . "  | George shrugged his shoulders . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as anything to validate the theory of the possibility of perfect crimes . An undiscovered mark is as good as no mark at all . " I stood up . " It 's getting late . What time do we have to be there ? " The sheriff flashed his white teeth at me . " Thanks , Miss Simpson . I 'd get to talking and forget entirely about the business at hand . " Delia and Bernard went to the door with him . They told him we 'd be down in an hour . When they came back Delia had a newspaper . " Sheriff Thompson brought this to us . He thought we might like to see it . He said the newspapers had called him to get the details . " The newspaper passed around the room slowly . It was a short news article . It said , merely , that Miss Margot Spendler had died as a result of a fall in the home of Mr. and Mrs. Bernard Parry . It said : Miss Spendler was the author of a book of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short stories , Garbed in Silver . She has been for the past seven years an advertising copy writer for Fibbs , McGill , and Snyder . Peg started to cry again . " She was going to autograph copies of her books for me . " Delia got up , went over to the bookcase , hunted for a while , then took the two thin volumes to Peg . " Here , darling , you may have these . " " Oh , I could n't do that . I could n't take them away from you . " " Yes , yes , I want you to have them . " She dropped the books on Peg 's lap . " I insist , Peg . " " That 's sweet of you , Delia . I should n't , but I do so want to have them . " She opened the front cover . " Her writing is beautiful too . " She passed her hand over the frontispiece . I walked over , looked at the signature . She must have practiced years to perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go to a funeral . We took a long time . Nobody talked . I saw Mother Parry put smelling salts in her handbag . " Just in case , " she said to me . She looked cute in her neat black seal , her saucy black hat . Bernard led her and Peg out to the car . The rest of us walked solemnly . Spike put me in his car , got in beside me . The two cars started down the hill ahead of us . A funeral procession . We drove slowly all the way , too . I looked over the hill , over the dunes . Cinders crackled under the tires . The air was crystal-clear , the sun so bright it glared . " It does n't seem possible that we 're going to do what we are . " He snorted . " That sounds like one of Peg 's sentences . " " She was wonderful this morning , was n't she ? I do n't see how she could tell about falling like that without going to pieces all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Oh , Spike , I wish we did n't have to go there . I wish we could turn around and go quickly someplace else . " " It 's got to be done . We 'll have to think , In an hour , or an hour and a half , it will be all over . " " Will it ? " I do n't know what made me say that . He looked at me so sharply the car switched to the side of the road . He righted it . " What do you mean , Jennie ? " I had a chance then . I could have told him what I meant . I could see how he reacted to the thing Jim and I knew  --  if he  | did n't already know it . Cowardice again . I said , " Oh , it might take a lot longer than that . " " Nope , it wo n't . Mere formality . As the sheriff said , it 's a matter of getting stuff into records . Outmoded bit of red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . Making us go through an ordeal for nothing . " " How will they do it , Spike ? " " I do n't know . I do n't know any more about it than you do . " Other cars passed us . They must have cussed the group of three cars huddled together , driving so slowly along the highway . I envied all of them . They were n't going to an inquest . They were n't bowed down , frightened by guilt . Suddenly I was really scared . What if some part of me , some vestige of my Quaker ancestors , were to scream the truth out in that inquest ? I had a horrible picture of myself standing up , accusing them , saying to the dry-faced coroner , to the pleasant sheriff , " One of these people committed a murder . Margot Spendler was murdered in cold blood . A planned , carefully planned murder  --  that would leave no mark that anyone could read . " I shuddered . Spike said , " Cold , Jennie ? Sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoved the thought out of my mind . I started talking . I said , " And tonight was the night we were going to go to the movies and hold hands . " I expected him to say , " How about Thursday ? " or something like that . Instead he said , " There will be other times . " It squelched me effectively . We did n't talk any more . We drove in silence down the main street of the town . It was n't difficult to find the undertaking parlors . There was a little crowd gathered in front . Bernard spoke to some of the men . Mother Parry stopped to talk to a woman with a bag of groceries in her arms . I looked at the place . There was a canopy of some kind that stretched from the doorway to the curb . You could see the  | heavy green plants through the plate-glass windows . Rubber plants . There was a sign in the window , CARLSON AND CARLSON , FUNERALS OF DISTINCTION . " Spike , Spike , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Do n't be silly , Jennie . Now of all times . " He could be more understanding . He need n't be so rough about it . He took firm hold of my arm , shoved me through the door . It was awful . Those plants  --  and heavy furniture , and semidarkness . We stood huddled together by the door . I thought of the hundreds of people who 'd walked into that room with sorrow heavy upon them . I took a deep breath . Incense . Oh , my God , incense ! A tall man came out of the back somewhere . Mr. Carlson . Mother Parry introduced us . " A terrible thing  --  so difficult for all of you . Would you care to view the body ? " I would n't go . Spike stayed with me , and George . We sat down on a couch . " Do you suppose I could have a cigarette ? " George said slowly , " I do n't think it 's the thing to do . Still , there are ash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the others in some room back there . George said , " I suppose we should have gone . " " I do n't know why , " I said . " It looks  --  looks kind of funny not to . " " I do n't know why . " I seemed to he repeating myself . " I always thought that was horrible anyway . I do n't want people coming around to look at mc . I wo n't have it . " Spike said , " A helluva lot you 'll care . " " Give me a cigarette , George , or I 'll get right up and walk out of here . And it will take six riot squads to get me back . " He lit the cigarette for me . " And you need n't talk like that , Spike . I 'm beginning to think Peg was right . You are rude . " " For God 's sake , shut up , Jennie . " I got up , tears in my eyes , and started to the door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the big lug , sat there . I snapped at George , " I 'm just going out to get a breath of air . I 'll be back . " " I 'll go with you , " he said quietly , and opened the door . We walked through the group of people . Let them see me crying . " He need n't be so mean , George . He does n't have to talk like that . Telling me to shut up . " " It 's just that we 're all under such a strain , Jennie . He does n't realize what he 's saying , or why . " " Well , I 'm under a strain too , but I do n't bite people 's heads off when they speak to me . " We walked up and down , up and down . Finally he said maybe we 'd better go back . There was a tall good-looking man with them when we walked in . I could tell immediately that he was Margot 's uncle . The same heavy dark red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was leaning toward her talking . When we were introduced he looked at me casually , but I knew he could have told you how thick or slim my ankles were . I had a feeling he could have told you a lot more about me than I 'd want most people to know . Wolf , I said to myself , a nice , refined wolf . Funny about women . I disliked him immediately , but it annoyed me that I 'd been dismissed with that first casual glance . He had a lovely voice , deep and resonant . " It was a shock to hear about Margot . We 're a strange family , though . We seldom saw each other . When she first came to Chicago to work Mrs. Spendler and I asked her to live with us , but Margot always wanted to go her own way . The strangest thing about it all is that I can remember when she was a little tyke , I visited them on their farm in Iowa  --  " Farm in Iowa . I thought of Delia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was a redheaded wiry brat . I told my brother one day that she was going to kill herself , the way she climbed around . He just laughed and said she was like a cat or a monkey . It 's  | strange that she should have died in this way . " He patted Delia 's hand . " So terrible for you , my dear , to have it happen in your home . " " Yes . " She widened her eyes at him , she looked the picture of gentle sorrow . " And to have the awful feeling that it was , in a sense , our fault  --  " " Oh , my dear , you must n't let that thought enter your head . " It was beautifully casual the way he put his arm across her slender shoulders . " I always say that what happens we must have no regret for  --  and if Margot insisted on sleeping in that bedroom , in spite of the ladder , certainly you ca n't be criticized . No , indeed not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family . Sheriff Thompson and the coroner came in the front door . There was a younger man with them . The sheriff looked at all of us . " Well , I guess everyone 's here . We can go in and start . " In the chapel . I suppose when they had funerals the heavy draperies were drawn . Now the windows were clear . They were very dirty . The sun shone in . Around the top of the room were stained-glass windows . Foolers . Crepe paper with lights behind to shine through . In the spot up in front where the casket would be there was a table and four chairs . Behind it were imitation pipes supposed to be a pipe organ . Over to one side was a pulpit . I could imagine a minister up there beginning the burial service . With the light of day coming through the dirty windows , you could see how tawdry everything was . Cheap velvet hangings , cheap plush . The coroner and sheriff and the young man went up to the front . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dusting off the top of the long table with a big handkerchief . Spike whispered to me , " I do n't think that guy can talk . How can he conduct an inquest ? " " He said , Possible , ' yesterday . " " That 's right , he did . " They had just got themselves seated around the table  | when Mr. Carlson came sliding down the aisle . " Is everything satisfactory , gentlemen ? " " Dusty , " the coroner said . Mr. Carlson was flustered . " So sorry . Today is the day the room is usually cleaned . We did n't know just when you would be here  --  " " All right , all right . " The coroner waved his hand . " If you need anything further I 'll be in my office . " He smiled at us as he walked out . We sat there , all of us , very still , moveless , watching the three men . The young man had a notebook and a bunch of freshly sharpened pencils , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm sure the coroner could n't have memorized what he said , but that 's what it sounded like . It was a conglomeration of legal terms and just plain talking . The gist of it was that we were here to investigate the death of one Margot Spendler , spinster . It was all said in such an offhand way that we hardly realized , any of us , when he was speaking directly to us . He had to repeat his request , asking us to stand to take the oath . We stood up quickly . My purse slid off my lap . Spike dived down to get it . He had to hunt , and the coroner watched , annoyed , until he was standing again , the purse in his hand . His face was flushed . The coroner asked us to raise our right hands . He dropped his official manner , he said to Spike , " Put the purse down , please , young man . " We looked , and I do n't know who started laughing , but in an instant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there holding my green pouch bag high over his head . He was furious . He shoved it at me , his face fiery red . I was laughing so much I could hardly take it . The coroner rapped his knuckles on the table . " If we might have less levity , please . " I had that awful hysterical shaking inside of me . I was afraid I 'd start laughing again and not be able to stop . He gave us  | the oath . I did n't know what I was swearing to . There was nothing the least bit solemn about it . A man standing by a table saying gibberish , and us in rows with our right hands raised foolishly in the air . When the sheriff had said " under oath " I 'd pictured myself standing with my hand on the Bible , vowing to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth . This was ridiculous . We sat down again . I whispered to Spike , " I 'm sorry , honey . " " That 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I shall have to ask you to be quiet . The less talking we do among ourselves the more quickly we can accomplish our purpose . " Spike whispered without moving his lips , " He 's down on us , kid . " He pulled down his heavy eyebrows , scowled at the coroner . Maybe there was something to his browbeating . The coroner cleared his throat and started shuffling papers around . He called Henry Spendler as the first witness . Mr. Spendler went up to the front and sat down . Just the proper degree of respect to the coroner . He certainly was a handsome man . Personally , I like them a little less handsome , but it was his voice that was marvelous . I could see him doing Macbeth . I Ic 'd be wonderful as Macbeth . Then I knew what it was he reminded me of  --  a matinee idol  --  that sleek look of being used to being admired . Damn the man . I hated his guts . He told smoothly about the first excited call from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the inquest . The sheriff had called him and he had come to identify the body and to make the necessary arrangements . " You state , then , that the deceased is your niece , Margot Spendler , spinster , age thirty-nine ? " " I do . " There was a distinct , audible gasp . I know I gasped . I 'd thought she was , at the most , twenty-eight  --  surely no more than two years older than I. " You know of no reason why the deceased should take her own life ? "  | " None . " He walked away from the chair , smiled at Delia as he sat down beside her . Bernard was called next . He told the same story he had before . " You say , " the coroner asked , " that she had to climb the ladder in the dark ? " " Yes . " " You did n't have any provisions made for such a situation ? no flashlights ? " " We keep flashlights in the bookcase in the living room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Why do you suppose she did n't ? " Bernard lifted his hands helplessly . " She just would n't bother . " " In other words , she was so accustomed to climbing the ladder that she 'd not think she needed a light ? " " Yes . " " Do you know of any reason that the deceased might have taken her own life ? " I held my breath . Awful if Bernard should get the idea that she had done that . He took a long time about answering . " No ? I can think of no reason why she should have committed suicide . " He was excused , and Peg went up to the chair . The coroner did n't make her tell her story again . He 'd ask her questions like : " You awakened at five-thirty ? " " You found the deceased at the foot of the ladder ? " ? so that she just had to answer yes and no , only she said , " Yes sir " and " No sir . " Mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either of their testimonies . Then the sheriff gave a resume of the whole thing . It was while he was in the midst of his story that it happened . I suppose everyone there felt as I did  --  tense , wrought up ,  | hanging onto his every word , not conscious of anything else in the room , not thinking of anything but his words  --  and adding to the plain , matter-of-fact recital all of the things we knew and he did n't . It started so softly that we were n't conscious of it at first ? the way you 're not conscious of music . You 're so used to hearing radios everywhere that you get so you do n't even register that they 're playing or what they 're playing . This started softly , and it took a minute or two for us to be aware of it . It became gradually louder  --  and the words started . Nearer , my God , to Thee , Nearer to Thee ! E'en though it be a cross That raiseth me , Still all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Thee . . . The sheriff stopped , jerked his head around to the coroner . I started to cry . I could hear Peg crying . I heard Bernard 's " Oh , my God . " And the coroner snapped at the young man , " Stop it . Stop it , I say . " Though like a wanderer , The sun gone down , Darkness be over me , My rest a stone , Yet in my dreams , I 'd be . . . It groaned off , as someone grabbed the needle of the phonograph . The young man had started down the aisle . He met Mr. Carlson , who was rushing in . I was sobbing , but I could hear Carlson . " Most regrettable . Terribly sorry . He was fixing the machine . He did n't know about the inquest . " I wanted to laugh , then , it all seemed ridiculous . The coroner  | looked mad , and the sheriff had such a vacuous expression on his broad face . The coroner dismissed Carlson , turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sheriff Thompson ? " The sheriff started , " Well , " as though he were trying to remember where he had stopped . Delia 's voice was frightened . " Mother Parry ! Mother Parry ! " We all looked . I thought she was dead . Right away I thought she was dead . She was slumped down in her chair , her head lopped forward , her mouth hanging open . But I could see that she was breathing , and I could hear her breathing loud gasps for breath . The coroner dashed forward , Bernard picked her up , carried her to a couch along the wall . Delia was beside them , and they were working over her . The rest of us stood watching , not saying a word  --  helpless , still  --  as they worked . The young man ran out of the room . When he came back the coroner waved Delia and Bernard away . They came over to where we were standing . He put his arms around her , both of them looking toward Mother Parry and hanging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bernard would hold her tighter . We could see her shivering from where we stood . She said , " Bernie , I ca n't stand any more . I ca n't . " The coroner came over to them . I heard his clipped words , watched the anxiety on their faces . " I 'm having her taken to the nursing home here in town . " Bernard asked , " But what is it , Doctor ? " " Heart , " he said . Delia 's voice shook . " Will she be all right ? Will she ? " " Ca n't tell . Shock . Too much for her . Pretty old . " They wheeled one of those cot things into the room . Delia and Bernard went in the ambulance with them . We did n't know what to do . The sheriff said we could go . We wandered out to the street . Jim said , " Let 's go into this restaurant and get some coffee . " There was a counter and tables . There were a few people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of women . They watched us come in and sit down . The juice box was playing . Somebody ordered coffee for all of us . No one said anything . I could n't get the sound of Mother Parry 's breathing out of my ears . George said , " It was the phonograph . As bad as if Margot had suddenly spoken  --  or had walked into the room  --  " " George ! Do n't . " Peg put her hands over her face . " I wish I had n't gone in to see her . I ca n't ever forget how she looked . " Spike suggested , " Maybe we could call the place where they took Mother Parry . Maybe we could find out something . " The fellow who brought the coffee was whistling . It was steaming hot and strong , in thick white cups . I had completely forgotten Margot 's uncle . I le walked into the restaurant , came over to our table . He spoke to George . " I have some things to attend to . Shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parrys ' later today ? I do n't want to leave until something definite is known about Mrs. Parry 's condition . And Delia " ? he did n't hesitate in using her name ? " Delia asked mc , too , to get Margot 's things . " George wrinkled his forehead . " I do n't know what to suggest . One of us will probably run over to the hospital shortly and find out how she is . " " Why do n't you leave a message for me here ? When you 'll be returning to the house . " " Yes  --  yes , we 'll do that . " He nodded to us and walked out . " A horrible person , " I said . At least the remark took their minds off what had happened . We argued about him . Peg thought he was wonderful . Spike was noncommittal . Jim said he seemed to be an all-right guy . But George agreed with me . That ended that discussion . There was a long silence . Spike cleared his throat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One shall be dead by violence . ' I wish I 'd never seen the thing . "  | I looked around at them . " We 'll all be batty if we keep on like this . We 'll be stark raving mad . I 'm going to have a piece of apple pie and cheese . " We all had something to eat . I ca n't say that it helped much . I felt as though I had a leaden weight in my stomach . Jim said he 'd drive over to the hospital and see how things were there . I was facing the windows . I watched the people walking back and forth , some of them hurrying , some of them sauntering . I tried to figure out who they were , where they were going . Two old men were standing on the curb talking excitedly . I said , " Spike , I 'll bet you fifty cents they 're arguing about the war . " We made up a pool . We all put in a quarter . George said they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an acre . Spike thought they were talking about their gall bladders or their blood pressure . Peg decided they were having a political argument . Spike was to go out and listen  --  so we made him take his quarter out of the pool because we would n't trust him . He lit a cigarette and walked out . We watched him . He walked to the curb , looked up and down the street , stood there near the two men . He came back , grinning . " Nobody wins . " " Well , for heaven 's sake , what were they talking about ? " " The new minister . One of them thinks he 's fine , and the other one thinks he 's too much of a go-getter . The tall , thin one keeps saying , Yah , but old Rev. Matthews had the right idea , ' and the one chewing tobacco says , Time to change , time to change . Never said nothing against Matthews , but always thought he was set in his ways . ' " Spike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of four cars would leave the curb first . Peg won the money . She said , " I 'm beginning to worry about the office . When Bernard is n't there , nothing goes right . " We thought about our office . I knew I 'd have a time when I got back . My boss always treated any of my absences as a personal affront . He 'd act tomorrow or the next day as though  | Margot had got herself killed to annoy him  --  as though I should know better than to run around with such people . Suddenly George said , " I think I 'll take a vacation . I think I 'll go out West  --  to California maybe . " Spike said , " Lucky you . " " I might get a job there . I 'm sick of this country . I wish I 'd never see another sand dune as long as I live . " Peg pushed her cup away . " Aw , George , do n't do that . We would n't see you then . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled . " Thanks , Peg . " " Do n't worry , chicken . " Spike patted her hand . " You could n't keep him away from Chicago . He loves every bit of it . " " Yeah . " George was staring at the wall . " Yeah , it 'd be tough thinking about snow falling on the water tower and me not there to see it . " I saw Jim parking in front of the restaurant . " Here comes Jim . " He did n't keep us waiting . " They 've got her over the first hurdle . Delia and Bernard are going to stay a little longer , and then they 're coming here . " Peg asked , " But is she going to be all right ? " " They do n't know . The doctor ca n't say . Depends on her resistance . He talked to me about it , but I could n't understand it at all . Delia looks terrible . " " I do n't see how she keeps going as it is . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through what Delia had in the past  --  my gosh , how many days was it ? ? Friday night we 'd come out  --  and this was Tuesday . I would n't have been able to take it . I 'd have passed out somewhere along the line . " Would n't it be awful " ? I do n't think Spike realized what he was saying ; he 'd surely not have said it if he had ? " would n't it be awful if out of Margot 's death  --  whom Mother Parry hated so thoroughly  --  should come her own death ? " Jim was finishing a cup of coffee . He dropped it . The coffee ran over the tablecloth . Peg grabbed a napkin and started mop
