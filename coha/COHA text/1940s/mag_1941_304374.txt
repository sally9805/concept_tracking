OWEN GLENDOWER - John Cowper Powys-Simon &; Schuster ( $5 ) . <P> The chief use of most historical novels is to improvise high chairs for small dinner guests . Owen Glendower is tactfully printed on thin paper and split into two portable volumes , as if the intention were that it be read . But in other respects it runs true to type . It is longer than most good books ( 938 pages ) ; it is padded ( the story hardly starts in the first 100 pages ) . All it lacks to be perfectly in the vogue is a jingoistic theme . <P> So far as Welshman John Cowper Powys is concerned , it has that too . It is about Wales during the years 1400-1416 . The title character is that subtle , flawed part-genius who led a Welsh-French army toward the London of Henry IV , and died a hermit . Its hero , a venturesome Oxford student named Rhisiart , is a young man with a " narrow skull . . . predatory beak and snatching lips . " He becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loyalty-love for his boss , and has become an English Justice by the time Glendower dies . <P> Some 60 other characters , invented and actual , supply the color . The wild Stone-Age magic that survives in Welsh blood has been responsible for much of the greatest in English poetry . But Author Powys , a professional Wild Welshman ( and proud of it ) , has never got his wildness quite under artistic control . In his thefts from Homer , Keats , Joyce Kilmer , the marriage service and Shakespeare , Burglar Powys invariably knocks over the china closet or steps on the cat . The following not untypical sentence should be engraved on the tomb of Krafft-Ebing : " He was witnessing . . . what few men have been privileged to contemplate : namely , the writhings of a lust-demented lady on the breast of a man whose arms were tied behind his back . " <P> There are two possibilities about Powys . One is that he is just as innocent and headlong as he seems . The other is that , like Ted Lewis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ham-for-the-hell-of-it , a talented and laughing charlatan who gives the people super-portions of what they seem to want . In either case , he makes his audience uncomfortable , but he holds them to the end .
