There is very little light in the Sun Room at the end of Ward Three in the City Hospital at the top of Legion of Honor Hill in San Francisco . The curved far wall of the modern room is plate-glass from floor to ceiling . The floor is bright yellow linoleum , and the walls are painted in thick orange and white stripes , some vertical , some horizontal . It is a wet , foggy morning in November , and every now and then the nearby foghorns are heard moaning . When the sun comes out and the fog clears the view from the plate-glass window will be good to see . Far down the hill , spanning the waters of the channel , will be the slim handsome Golden Gate Bridge , upon the waters will be Alcatraz Island , across the waters will be the steep green hills of Marin County , and over them will be the sky . Thus the room gives the impression of being a small part of something large in high flight . The room 's furnishings are good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property : two folding tables for cards or sitting and talking ; a red-leather davenport and chair ; a half dozen folding chairs ; and shelves containing books , magazines and games . In a corner is a spinet piano , painted white . Near the piano is a blonde-wood combination radio-phonograph , and beside the machine is a small gray table cluttered with phonograph records . The ward janitor , called MOPPER , is almost finished mopping . He is one of those enormous , simple souls who are always doing the dirty work at public hospitals , jails , poorhouses , and asylums . Almost a freak , he is an old man who never grew out of childhood . One shoulder is lower than the other , something seems to be the matter with one leg , his whole body seems to be off balance , and he seems to be asking himself questions all the time . His voice is high-pitched , like a boy 's , and the upper part of his body weaves a rhythm when he is excited or troubled . A small man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ POSEYO , whistles Mozart softly as he searches through the records on the table beside the phonograph . Over his gray pajamas he wears the long white robe of the hospital and looks as if he had been costumed by an amateur play-producer to represent the angel in a Sunday School pageant . His enormous black moustache and his deep voice do not help the impression very much , however . He puts a twelve-inch record on the machine , draws up a folding chair , opens it , and sits down to listen . MOPPER stops work to listen , too . He listens ten seconds or so , his freak 's face bewildered by what he hears , his body weaving a rhythm . Then he goes back to work , stopping every now and then to listen some more . At last he takes his bucket and mop and leaves quietly . The record is Victor Red Seal No. 16086-A , Mozart 's Concerto in C Major , 2d Movement , Andante , Artur Schnabel at the piano with the London Symphony Orchestra , conducted by Malcolm Sargent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little that some of the music can scarcely be heard , and none of it is ever loud enough to seem a breaking of silence . The music seems in fact to be silence itself . When the record ends , POSEYO goes to the window to look out into the fog , and the machine automatically starts the record again . Now , a very black Negro in his early forties who calls himself GREEDY REED comes into the room slowly , looks around , and very quietly slides the big glass door shut behind him . He is puffing at a freshly-lit cigar . He listens to the music a moment , looking from the machine to the man , then carefully sits himself down on the small stool in front of the piano , sets his cigar on the piano , and tries to pick out a soft accompaniment to the music . Suddenly he assaults the instrument with all his might , making an astounding racket of piano gibberish , as POSEYO turns to watch and listen , and MOPPER comes back in to see what all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GREEDY REED ends his solo with a flourish , whereupon the sombre music of the phonograph is heard again . He stands , steps away from the piano , bows as if to an audience , kisses the palms of both hands loudly and flings them out in front of him , walks off smartly as if in concert exit , comes back shyly , bowing and throwing kisses , falls on his knees , touches the floor with his head several times , and then gets up wearily and settles down on the piano-stool to catch his breath . When he is breathing easily again he takes up his cigar and swings around slowly to face POSEYO . REED You know what I hear about you , Poseyo ? You know what I hear the men in the ward say about you just now , sitting in bed eating breakfast ? p. 3 POSEYO What ? REED Man , I hear Brick and Georgie Porgie say you ai n't no good . That 's exactly what I hear them say . Now , why they say that about a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and always nice ? Why they say you ai n't nice , Poseyo ? POSEYO Why ? REED Because you hate everybody , Georgie Porgie say . You hear me , Poseyo ? Hate . Now , why he say that about you ? I know you do n't hate me . Who you hate , then ? POSEYO Who ? REED Nobody , that 's who . If you hate somebody , why you give me your whole breakfast this morning , except the orange juice ? Why you give me your whole supper last night , except the tapioca pudding ? Why you invite me , the only colored man in the ward , to take the bed next to your bed when I come here three days ago ? If you hate , Poseyo , why you talk to me like a father all night that first night ? POSEYO I do n't know . REED Who give me a whole dollar the next day for cigars ? You did , Poseyo ! Man , I been living this life forty-four years and I never see a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man of all . Here you are with the dying men , and they talking behind your back . That ai n't right ! I know you do n't hate nobody ! p. 4 POSEYO I do n't know . REED Go on , man , you never hate nobody in your whole life . You ai n't got no hate in your whole nature . I 've done a lot of hating in my forty-four years , but you ca n't pass for no hater . You know what 's the matter with Georgie Porgie and Brick ? POSEYO What ? REED They 're jealous , that 's what ! POSEYO No . They just sick . REED No , they 're jealous because a little bit of a man like you who 's nice to everybody is going to be alive when they 're dead . POSEYO ( Shaking his head ) No . You make mistake . REED Mistake ? Did n't Jasper die last night who was bragging in bed yesterday morning how he was going to be here all through the next big war and depression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lunch , talk to him , put him on the wagon , wheel him away ? Did n't he go and never come back ? Well , who told you to your face he 'd be here long after you were cold and dead ? Jasper told you , that 's who ! He was sick all right , but he was jealous , too , just like all the others . Man , to hear them talk , it 's your fault Jasper kick the bucket . They 're mad at you now , Poseyo . I see tears in the eyes of Brick because the leader of the choir ai n't going to be around no more to make him feel good with his smart-aleck bragging , but you ai n't going to see no tears in my eyes for the leader of the choir . No , sir ! ( Pause , softly ) I got a whole choir of my own to lead . p. 5 POSEYO I do n't know . Jasper want to live . REED Is that the way to live ? Laughing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're so scared and jealous ? ( He falls silent a moment , as the sun begins to shine into the room ) Man , you saw me make a fool of myself here at this little piano a minute ago , all alone in this lonesome place . You saw me cutting up like a boy with a pie . Is that the way to live ? Sure Jasper want to live . Sure Georgie Porgie and Brick and all the others out there who do n't even get out of bed no more want to live , but is that the way to do it ? Laughing and bragging , ganging up , singing in the hate choir , talking behind your back because you been here three months and they ai n't , and never will be ? Hating you because they 're afraid to die , and you ai n't ? Every one of them sick and jealous ? ( Pause ) I got something to tell you , Poseyo . ( He falls silent again . He looks POSEYO straight in the eye ) I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's right ! You got a right to be surprised , but it 's true . I am jealous . Jealous and scared to death . I 'm jealous of the three months you been here , Poseyo , and I 'm scared to death of this whole dying business . Man , I did n't think about dying one time in my whole life until I come here , and now that 's all I think about . Where will I be three months from now ? Will I be walking down Lenox Avenue in New York in a brand-new gabardine suit ? No . Will I be sitting in the ball park eating peanuts and drinking beer ? No . That 's too much to ask for , and I got sense enough to know it . I know there ai n't no more good times like that for me . I 'm here now . Well , will I be here three months from now ? Will I be in this nice room , listening to this nice music , looking down the hill at the Golden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? How about that , Poseyo ? You made it , and I want to make it , too , but I 'm scared to death I wo n't make it . I swear to God I did all that ornery stuff to get on your nerves , Poseyo , and make you go back to bed and die , so I could feel better about the short time I got left . I wanted to get your goat , Poseyo . I wanted to spoil your morning peace in this nice room . I wanted to spoil your morning peace in this nice room . I wanted to spoil the nice music you was listening to . I wanted to spoil the whole day for you , and the rest of your life  --  me , Greedy Reed , the man you been so nice to . p. 6 POSEYO That 's all right . REED There ! You see ? You do n't even hate a man who wants you to die , so he can feel a little better about the short time he got left . Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . REED No , that 's no way to live . That 's the way of a man who 's scared , a man like me  --  big like this for no good reason , black the way I am for no good reason , cheap and stingy and mean for no good reason , hating all the time for no good  --  well , I ca n't say I hate for no good reason . I 'd be a liar to say that . I never did a right thing in my whole life , I guess , but I know I got good reasons to hate . I guess I got just about the best reasons in the world to hate . Well , here I am , going to die . Here I am , still hating and still wanting to get even on somebody  --  so who do I pick ? You , Poseyo , the best man I ever saw . Is that the way to live ? You do n't look at me the way I been looked at all my life , every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be liked , trying my best to be friendly and polite . Afraid I 'll turn myself loose and let the murder go free if I ai n't friendly and polite all the time , if I let my eyes look at them the way their eyes look at me . I know that ai n't the way to live , but what other way can I live , black this way ? ( Pause ) I could have been a white man in another life , but here I am black as ever and scared to death I 'll be dead before I get a chance to get even . Man , I got to get even . I got to get even on somebody . ( Softly ) I wish to God I was in Africa , a place I never saw . I wish to God I never saw America instead  --  to make me feel so wrong , so out of place , and then put me here on top of everything else . I wish to God I was born in the jungle with decent animals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God the tiger take my hide instead of disease . ( He sighs ) You 're the only man I ever tell the truth to in my whole life , Poseyo . I know you do n't hate nobody , but you might as well know I do . I hate everybody , even you ! I even hate you for being the best man I ever saw . What right you got to be a good man in this crooked life ? I give you fair warning , I going to kill somebody before I die , so if you want to be safe , go ahead and tell the hospital and let them put me where I be alone . I been alone all my life anyway . ( Pause ; softly ) I see Georgie Porgie and Brick getting out of bed now , getting ready to come out here and be in the sun , so go ahead and tell them if you want to be safe . p. 7 POSEYO I no tell . REED Why not ? POSEYO I take chance . REED Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why you let me go ? Why you let the murder go free ? POSEYO In this place every man know his own sickness . Every man talk . I do n't know . I listen to music . REED You know , Poseyo , I believe you know something ? I believe you keeping something back ? ( His face brightening with the pose of friendship ) Here they come now.GEORGIE PORGIE , a heavy-set , red-headed man in his late forties with his left eye and part of his face covered , comes in , followed by BRICK , a man in his late thirties . REED Well , it 's about time you boys got out of bed . Seem like I been hanging around here a whole hour wasting my time listening to Poseyo 's music . PORGIE That 's Mozart . ( He pronounces the name correctly . ) REED Oh , I do n't say it ai n't Mozart all right , Georgie Porgie . It 's Mozart through and through , no doubt about that . Mozart over and over again telling Poseyo something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shelf and riffling them ) Old Mozart , he do n't tell Greedy Reed nothing . Brick , you feel like a little game of casino this nice morning ? p. 8 BRICK ( Wandering to the window ) I 'm too damn tired to play cards  --  too tired , too tired . REED ( Watching him ) How come you too tired to play cards so early in the morning , man ? BRICK Too damn tired . Too tired to talk , even . Too tired to listen . REED You was n't too tired to eat your breakfast . You was n't too tired to talk a little while ago . BRICK So damn sick and tired I can barely stand here and look down at Alcatraz . Sick and tired of looking down at Alcatraz . Sick and tired of Poseyo 's music . REED You may be sick and tired of Poseyo 's music , but you was n't too sick and tired a little while ago to cry about your friend who kick the bucket last night . ( BRICK turns and stares at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BRICK turns away ) How about you , Georgie Porgie ? You want to pass a little time playing casino ? PORGIE I promised old Doc Stark I 'd take things easy . I ai n't sick and tired of anything , so I 'm going to keep my promise . Games make me nervous . I 'll just sit here and read this comic book about Joe Palooka . REED Yeah , you take good care of yourself now . You keep your promise to old Doc Stark . I just thought maybe you could take things easy playing a little casino . p. 9 PORGIE ( Looking into the comic book ) No , I get nervous when I play games.GREEDY REED watches GEORGIE PORGIE turn the pages of the book , turns to BRICK , whose back is turned , then glances at POSEYO as ANDY BOY , a Chinese boy of twenty-five or so , comes in . REED Andy Boy , I 'm glad to see you out of bed ! I know you ai n't going to refuse no invitation to sit down and play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know how to play casino , but I 'll play you a little gin rummy . REED ( Helping him ) Well , all right , sit right down here and make yourself comfortable . Casino or gin rummy , it 's all the same to me , but you keep score because I do n't know how . ANDY BOY sits down . GREEDY REED shuffles the cards and deals . NOBODY speaks for a moment , but GEORGIE PORGIE laughs as he looks at pictures of Joe Palooka , and GREEDY REED looks over at him . BRICK Know anybody who ever did time at Alcatraz , Georgie Porgie ? PORGIE Did what where ? BRICK Anybody around here know anybody who ever did time at Alcatraz ? REED If you talking to me , the name 's Greedy Reed . I give the name to myself because I been so hungry all my life . Anybody do time at Alcatraz , still doing time at Alcatraz . Time and time again . Part-time , full-time , over-time . p. 10 ANDY BOY Gin ! REED Gin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a whole handful . Listen to me count . Ten , twenty , thirty , forty , forty-nine , fifty-seven , sixty-four , seventy-one , and this little old lousy ace of hearts , seventy-two . Seventy-two plus twenty for gin , ninety-two . ( He turns to BRICK , whose back is still turned ) Is that right ? ANDY BOY Ninety-two all right . That 's the most I ever caught anybody with . ( He writes on the score card , shuffles and deals . ) BRICK I feel sorry for those guys on Alcatraz looking at San Francisco every day . PORGIE Looking at San Francisco 's not as bad as looking at the Golden Gate Bridge . BRICK What 's so bad about looking at the Golden Gate Bridge ? PORGIE The ideas you get . BRICK What ideas ? PORGIE What do you think you 'd like to do when you see a bridge ? You think you 'd like to cross it . Well , if you 're on the Rock , you know you 'll never be able to cross the bridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't here you laughing . I been laughing about Joe Palooka ever since I sat down . I do n't hear you laughing , though . p. 11 BRICK I suppose you can cross the bridge ? PORGIE I know damn well I can cross the bridge any time I feel like it . BRICK Ah , you 're always talking big . Sure you can cross the bridge  --  once ! PORGIE Me and everybody else , too .  --  Once ! BRICK Everybody else do n't have to think about crossing it in the same kind of hurry that you do . PORGIE I 'm satisfied . I ai n't kicking . I 'm not going to cross the bridge until I feel like it . I do n't feel like it just now because I know I can cross it any old time I feel like it . I know I 'm free . The boys on the Rock know they 're not free . BRICK Yeah , and I do n't want to hear any more about it . You 're just naturally cheerful , that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you mean I ought to feel bad because Jasper died last night , the answer is I do n't think I ought to feel bad at all . What did you expect him to do ? Live ? What did everybody expect Roosevelt to do ? Live ? And Mussolini and Hitler and all the little guys who die every day ? Did everybody expect them to live ? Well , they did for awhile . Joe Palooka will live longer than any of them , and Joe Palooka ai n't even real . p. 12 BRICK Poseyo , your music 's making a fool out of that poor man . What do you say we try another record ? POSEYO That 's all right . BRICK What do you say we take a chance on the first record I pick up ? Maybe it 'll give Georgie Porgie some new ideas about Roosevelt and Joe Palooka and all the little guys who die every day . PORGIE Play any kind of music you like , I 'll still know what I know . I 'll still know I ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself ai n't going to make any real difference much , either . I 'm satisfied to sit here and try to guess what lunch is going to be . Hash , most likely . I hate the stuff , but I know I 'll eat it and like it , because that 's the way it 's got to be until I 'm good and ready to cross the bridge . Sickness ai n't going to make a monkey out of me . BRICK Why do n't you wait till the new music starts before you make a monkey out of yourself ? PORGIE Go ahead , start the new music . BRICK puts needle to disc and the music turns out to be Heartaches , very loud , played by Ted Weems and his orchestra . REED There you are ! More Mozart ! Seem like everything around here Mozart  --  Mozart  --  Mozart ! ( Shifting his cards around swiftly and slapping them down in front of him ) Mozart , Andy Boy ! p. 13 ANDY BOY Gin ? REED That 's right . That 's exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my language for a change , too . Viper talk . ( He claps his hands , gets up , prances around the table , and half-sings to the rhythm of the music ) Moz  --  art , Moz  --  art , I hear you talking , little sweetheart . ( He examines ANDY BOY 'S cards ) How much I catch you with ? ANDY BOY Twenty-one , and twenty for gin , forty-one.He writes on the score pad , as GREEDY sits down and shuffles the cards . REED Poseyo , you know what old Mozart saying to me now ? He saying , Yeah man ! That 's exactly what he saying over and over again . ( He sweeps up his cards and looks at them quickly ) And he just about the biggest liar that ever live ! POSEYO Oh ? REED That 's right , Poseyo . Mozart tell me yeah , cards tell me no . Music tell me maybe , numbers tell me never . Drum tell me sure , hospital tell me scat . ( He studies his cards with distaste ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the table face down , and looks straight ahead at nothing . He looks around and notices that GEORGIE is asleep on his folded arms . He gets up and shuts off the machine . BRICK is sitting on the piano stool , looking down at the keys of the piano . ANDY holds his cards , waiting for GREEDY tocome back to the game . GREEDY looks at POSEYO , as if he were trying to find out what it is he thinks POSEYO knows . He speaks slowly and quietly ) What you keeping back , Poseyo ? I know you keeping something back . p. 14 POSEYO I do n't know . REED Is this the way to live ? Ignorant and mad this way all the time ? Sick and ugly , and nothing right to do before we go ? Why you keeping back what you keeping back , Poseyo ? POSEYO I do n't know . I forget . REED ( As if he had suddenly learned a great secret ) Forget ? ( Pause ) Is that the secret , Poseyo ? Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to live ? Just forget ? Just let everything go ? Forget my name ? Forget my color ? Forget I 'm here ? Forget I was ever born ? Is that the way , Poseyo ? How you learn to forget ? ( He picks up the 12-inch record and looks at it ) Mozart teach you ? This music here teach you ? Man , I hear this music all morning . This music do n't teach me to forget . ( He puts the record back ) Make me remember worse than ever . Make me remember stuff I been forgetting all my life . Make me remember stuff I been forgetting all my life . Make me remember the half dozen different men I been , the half dozen different lives I live . Make me remember all the years I try to find out how to live , what to do . Make me remember the time I believe I know what to do  --  preach the gospel ! BRICK ( With amazement ) Oh , Jesus ! GEORGIE looks up at BRICK , unnoticed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I been forgetting all my life . Enjoy life and preach the gospel of enjoyment . Too late to enjoy now . Too late to preach the gospel now , but I got to find me something right to do before I go , something to teach me to forget , too . BRICK Oh , Christ ! REED Now , if I could read , I believe I 'd like to sit down with a great big book and read it . I 'd like to bury myself in the biggest book there is and just read it and forget everything . BRICK You ai n't going to be buried in any book ! You 're going to be buried in a box , just like Jasper and all the rest of us . You 'll forget everything in the box all right . REED ( Turning on him , as GEORGIE watches ) You been teasing me long enough ! No need to tease me any more ! I hear every teasing word you say , but I keep my mouth shut because I do n't want to hurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better speak to me when I speak to you , and you better speak with respect . I invite you to play cards because I want to be polite . You do n't have to play cards if you do n't want to , but you got to be polite , too . You got to look at me like a man when you tell me you do n't want to play , instead of looking somewhere else , because I got to know we talking about the same thing . I got to know you ai n't talking about color . Right now I see your eyes saying nigger to me . Any man  --  any man in this whole world  --  say nigger to me now with his mouth , I shut him up forever , I choke him to death ! You hear ? ( Pause ) I been talking to Poseyo , not you . Why you start new trouble for me first thing in the morning ? p. 16 BRICK What the hell 's the matter with you ? I was only kidding . REED I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , all over this country . Everything in this whole country been kidding me about my color , my smell , the shape of my head , my ignorance , the way I walk and talk and everything else . I been kidded long enough . No need to be kidded here , too . BRICK I was only talking . Everybody likes to talk once in awhile . You been talking ever since I come in here . ( Pause ) I ai n't proud of my color . REED What you proud of , then ? BRICK I ai n't proud . REED What you mean ? BRICK I just ai n't proud at all  --  of anything . I do n't think you ought to threaten anybody just because your color happens to be black  --  just because you happen to be sensitive about it . REED What you talking about now ? BRICK I almost never look at anybody when I talk to them . I remember what they look like , so I do n't have to look at them . Looking at them makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you want to know the truth , I 've never before noticed your color . p. 17 REED I know you ai n't teasing no more . What you trying to say to me ? BRICK I 'm saying I ai n't got time to notice little things about myself or anybody else any more . Color is one of the little things I 've never bothered to notice . REED You trying to say you was n't laughing at me ? BRICK I was laughing at myself . I was laughing at an old friend who 's turned out to be a bore . If I get on your nerves , do n't forget you get on mine , too . So does Poseyo and everybody else around here . So what ? Doctor Stark gets on my nerves . The janitor mopping the floor gets on my nerves . I get on my own nerves . So what ? I do n't have to kill myself for that , do I ? You do n't have to threaten anybody for that , do you ? REED You sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straighter . REED I 'm sorry , then . I swear to God , I 'm sorry I threaten you.GEORGIE buries his head in his folded arms again . BRICK If you do n't mind , then , I 'll stop looking you in the eye . It makes me ashamed of both of us . ( Pause , softly ) Only the eyes of animals have the dignity and peace men want  --  especially the most savage animals , like the lion , the tiger , and the panther . The eyes of men stop at details . The eyes of animals never notice them . I wish you had n't called my attention to your color . ( He stands ) A lot of people think the Bible 's a nice book . Maybe that 's the book you 're looking for . p. 18 REED I 'm much obliged to you , but maybe there 's a bigger book than the Bible . BRICK Well , the dictionary 's a pretty big book , too . REED Bigger than the Bible ? BRICK Two or three times . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's only words . REED That 's all right . That 's exactly what I want . Words . All the words in the world . ( He goes to the book shelf ) Which one of these books is the dictionary ? BRICK That great big one there . I 'm going to walk around the ward . I 'm sick and tired of myself . ( Softly ) I 'm sick and tired of you , too . REED Ah , do n't go away mad , Brick . BRICK I ai n't mad.BRICK goes out . GREEDY takes the dictionary off the shelf , opens it and looks into it . REED Poseyo , you hear that man ? You hear what he say ? Sick and tired of himself and sick and tired of me , too . He not a bad man , Poseyo . Just seem like I too ignorant to understand anybody . I been thinking all the time he look down at me , but he do n't look down at me . Leastaways no more than he look down at himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't even notice my color , and I know he tell me the truth . I been thinking all the time he hate me , call me nigger in his heart , and I been hating him . Man , I got to stop being ignorant . I got to learn . I got to learn something besides hate . I got to understand . I been thinking that man my worst enemy , but he no enemy at all . If he ai n't no friend , he ai n't no enemy , either . He too sick and tired to be either a friend or a enemy . Man , I got to understand about that . Now , here 's this big book right here in my hands  --  the holy dictionary , full of all the words in the world . I got to understand the words .

Man , look at all the words right here on the first page , look at all the beautiful words.Do us good to read the words Andy Boy . ANDY BOY Take a month to read the whole dictionary . REED Take more than a month , Andy Boy . Take three months , maybe four ! Three or four beautiful months with the dictionary , Andy Boy . Come on , read me the first word . Words better than cards any day , Andy Boy . Words tell us who we are , what we doing , where we going .

Now , we 're on our way , Andy Boy . Read about A to me . What do A mean ? ANDY BOY ( Reading ) A. The first letter of the alphabet in most of the known languages of the earth .

ANDY BOY The Ethiopian , I guess . REED You talking about that man in Africa ? ANDY BOY What man in Africa ? REED That skinny man with the whiskers ? Poseyo , who that man in Africa with the whiskers ? POSEYO I do n't know . REED Andy Boy , you remember before the War a country someplace in Africa that Mussolini take away from that man with the whiskers . ANDY BOY I do n't remember . REED ( Shaking GEORGIE ) Georgie Porgie , you awake ? PORGIE ( Sitting up with a start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me the dictionary . We working on the first word right now .

House and tigers and country ? You mean Haile Selassie ? REED Yeah , that 's the man . That Ethiopic , is that his language ? PORGIE I guess so . What difference does that make ? REED He was the King of some kind of black people in Africa . That Ethiopic , is that the language of them black people ? PORGIE I guess it 's the language of some kind of black people . Why ? What are you so excited about ? REED Andy Boy , read about that A again for Georgie Porgie , so he know why I excited this way . ANDY BOY ( Reading ) A.

PORGIE If you 're superstitious thirteen means bad luck . REED Everybody superstitious . PORGIE If you 're not superstitious every number means bad luck . REED What you mean , every number mean bad luck ? I hear thirteen the unlucky number . p. 22 PORGIE Ah , let me go back to sleep , will you ? I was sitting on a porch in the summertime , listening to carpenters building a house , hammering nails into wood far away , and I was drinking a bottle of Coca-Cola . You come and shake me out of the best dream I ever had . REED I 'm sorry I wake you out of that nice dream , Georgie Porgie . You sure thirteen ai n't the unlucky number ? PORGIE O.K. , have it your way . Thirteen is the unlucky number . Now , leave me alone , will you ? REED Ah , man , do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read the dictionary . I 'm wide-awake now . REED I 'm sorry I spoil your nice dream , Georgie Porgie . PORGIE Forget it . Maybe if you did n't wake me up , I would n't remember the dream , and then where would I be ? REED You all right now ? PORGIE Sure . REED You want to tell me about thirteen ? PORGIE Sure . REED What do that number mean ? I got to know before I go on reading the dictionary . What do it mean ? p. 23 PORGIE Nothing . It 's the number between twelve and fourteen . REED You sure ? PORGIE That 's all it is . REED You sure you ai n't being superstitious ? PORGIE Hell no . Thirteen 's just another number , no different from any other number . REED No different from one or three , twenty-one or thirty-three ? PORGIE Or two or four , twenty-two or forty-four . REED Then if the letter A is number thirteen in the Ethiopic language instead of number one , that do n't mean black people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your word for it , Georgie Porgie . Go ahead , Andy Boy , read the next word . ANDY BOY There 's some more about A. REED Yeah ? ANDY BOY And after A , there 's a lot of words I never heard of before . REED What kind of words ? ANDY BOY ( Reading slowly ) Abaca . Abaciscus . Abacot . You do n't want me to read every word in the dictionary , do you ? p. 24 REED Well , almost every word . You can skip abaciscus and words like that , I guess . No harm in skipping abaciscus , I guess . What else the dictionary say about A ? ANDY BOY ( Reading slowly ) A is the first letter because it represents the first vocal sound naturally formed by the human organs , being the sound uttered with a mere opening of the mouth without constraint , and without any effort to alter the natural position or configuration of the lips . ( Weary pause . ) PORGIE ( To GREEDY ) You know what that means ? REED @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first talking a man do . Go ahead , Andy Boy , read some more . ( Gently ) What 's the matter , Andy Boy ? ANDY BOY I do n't know . I do n't feel so good . ( Reading slowly ) Hence the letter A is found in many words first uttered by infants , which words are the names of the objects with which infants are first concerned , as the breast and the mother and the father . Hence in Hebrew Am is mother , Ab is father . In Chaldee , Syriac and Arabic , father is Abba ; in Ethiopic , Abi ; in Malayan and Bengalese , Bappa ; in Welsh , Tad , whence we retain Dad ; in Old Greek and in Gothic , Atta ; in Irish , Aithair ; in Cantabrian , Aita ; in Lapponic , Atki ; in Abyssinian and Amharic , Aba ; in the Shilhic and Melindane African dialects , Baba ; and Papa is found in many languages . p. 25 REED I know this the right book for us , Andy Boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read . Any more about A ? ANDY BOY Yeah . ( Reading ) Hence the Latin word for the breast , Mamma , in popular usage is the name of mother . REED Well , what do you know ? ANDY BOY ( Reading ) This list might be greatly extended , but these examples prove A to be the first natural vocal sound , and entitled to the first place in alphabets . REED You just hang on now , Andy Boy ! What else do the book say ? ANDY BOY ( Wearily ) Well , it says , A , as a symbol , in Hebrew , Syriac , Chaldee , Samaritan and Arabic , denotes one or unity . REED Hot dog ! Now , let me just stand here a minute , Andy Boy , and remember all that stuff . ( Pause ) I got it ! I got the first word in the book now . Pappa , Mamma ! Read the next word , Andy Boy . ANDY BOY All right to leave out some of the words I told you about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something , Andy Boy . On the other hand , if we leave out some of the words now , when we finish the whole book , we going to have something to go back to . We always going to have something to fall back on . p. 26 PORGIE ( Watching ANDY ) We 've always got something to fall back on anyway . REED What that ? God ? PORGIE Well , I was thinking we 've always got sleep to fall back on , but let 's put it your way . Let 's say it 's God we 've always got to fall back on . REED You believing man , Georgie Porgie ? PORGIE Oh , I believe all right . REED You believe about God ? PORGIE Why not ? REED What you believe about God ? PORGIE Everything I hear . REED What you hear ? PORGIE I hear God loves every one of us . REED You believe that ? PORGIE Yes , I do . REED What else you hear ? PORGIE I hear God 's got good reasons for everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pause , thinking ) You believe about Heaven at all ? PORGIE Quite a bit . p. 27 REED What you believe about Heaven , Georgie Porgie ? PORGIE I believe Heaven 's a nice idea . REED You believe you going there ? PORGIE Yes , I do . ( Pause , softly ) Let 's hear the next word . REED Yeah ! You like hearing the words , too , Georgie Porgie ? PORGIE Sure . REED What 's the next word , Andy Boy ? ANDY BOY Abandon . REED What do abandon mean ? ANDY BOY ( Reading ) Abandon . To forsake entirely . To leave and not come back . To give up . To evacuate . REED Yeah . About time I learn some words . About time I get me a little education . About time I get me a big vocabulary . Man , we got something right to do now , Andy Boy . We got a job worth doing . When me and you evacuate for lunch , Andy Boy , you keep the place in the book , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for come back ? ANDY BOY Return ? REED Yeah . So that when we  --  Ai n't there a bigger word than return ? Something with a nice sound like evacuate ? p. 28 ANDY BOY No , I think return is the only word there is for come back . You know any other word for come back , Georgie Porgie ? PORGIE Reincarnation has something to do with coming back , I believe , but not from lunch . REED From what , then , Georgie Porgie ? PORGIE From another life . Some people believe every one of us is a reincarnation from another life . REED No fooling , Georgie Porgie ? PORGIE A lot of people believe we come and go all the time . REED Where I come from ? PORGIE A long time ago in Africa , I guess . REED Where I going ? PORGIE Well , that 's hard to say because by the time any of us are ready to come back there may not be anything to come back to . REED What you mean ? PORGIE If there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are we going to come back to ? REED Who says there ai n't going to be no human life left on this earth ? PORGIE A lot of people do . We ai n't the only people who 're dying , you know . The whole human race is. p. 29 REED What the whole human race dying from ? PORGIE Starvation , homelessness , exhaustion , fear , anger , anxiety , despair , nervousness , overwork , worry . REED You mean all them things killing everybody ? PORGIE That 's what I read in the newspapers . That 's what I hear over the radio . REED Everybody dying right now ? PORGIE So I hear . REED Ah , you just saying that to make me feel good . The whole world seem just about the same as ever to me . PORGIE It ai n't , though . REED You talking about that lousy Adam bomb ? Go on , man , no little old Adam bomb going to finish human beings . PORGIE Maybe not , but it 's going to help . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know . REED No Adam bomb and no disease going to finish human beings . If we going to come back some time , we going to have something to come back to all right . Question is , are we going to come back ? PORGIE A lot of people have always thought so . ( Pause ) I guess return is just about the best word there is for coming back from lunch , though . p. 30 REED Well , that ai n't no new word for me , but it 's all right , I guess . You keep the place in the dictionary when we evacuate for lunch , Andy Boy , so that when we return we can pick up right where we left off . ANDY BOY O.K. REED Let me hear the next word . Seem like I ca n't wait to hear the next word . ANDY BOY ( Reading ) Abbreviate . REED What do abbreviate mean ? ANDY BOY ( Reading ) To shorten . To abridge by the omission of a part . REED Read that again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ANDY BOY ( Slower ) To shorten . To abridge by the omission of a part . REED And that will be exactly what me and you ai n't going to do , Andy Boy . No , sir . We been abbreviating all over the place up to now , but from now on we going to go slow and easy . From now on we going to get on no bridge and take no short cut . We going to read the whole dictionary . What 's the next word , Andy Boy ? ANDY BOY Abdicate . REED I hear that word long time ago when that King of England step down from his throne , but I sure glad to hear it again , Andy Boy . Abdicate . That means to quit your job when you 're King , but what do the book say ? p. 31 ANDY BOY In a general sense , to relinquish , renounce , or abandon . REED Yeah . That 's right . What else do the book say ? ANDY BOY To abandon an office or trust without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without their consent . Also , to abandon a throne without a formal surrender of the crown . Blackstone . REED Who that ? PORGIE That 's the man who said that . REED He must know a lot to say that . What else do the book say ? ANDY BOY To relinquish an office before the expiration of the term of service . REED Yeah . Relinquish . There 's a real nice word to say , but so far the best I hear is that Mamma and Pappa . Any more about abdicate in the book there ? ANDY BOY In civil law , to disclaim and expel from the family , as a father his child . ( Pause ) That 's all for abdicate . REED You hear that , Poseyo ? You see the good job I find for me and Andy Boy ? I ai n't holding back no secrets from nobody . Read the next word , Andy Boy . ANDY BOY Abdomen . REED You sending me straight to Heaven with the words , Andy Boy , and we got the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you looking for over there , Poseyo ? Your record right there on top . Put your record on the machine if you tired of listening to words . p. 32 POSEYO I not tired . I like words . I find new music . REED Yeah , Poseyo . Let 's hear some new music to go with the words . We up to abdomen now . ( He pats his belly ) That 's right in here some place . Read what the book say , Andy Boy.POSEYO searches through the records . ANDY BOY ( Reading ) Abdomen . The belly or that part of the body which lies between the thorax and the bottom of the pelvis . It contains the stomach , liver , spleen , pancreas , kidneys , bladder , and intestines . REED Yeah , man ! I know the way to live now , Poseyo . Andy Boy and me , we got ourselves the best of everything now ! We got words . On purpose words , not accidental words . Straight words . Words that mean what they say . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a red face and a gentle manner , accompanied by the DAY NURSE , an elderly woman , steps into the room . GREEDY falls silent . The DOCTOR nods absently , as if to everyone in the room , studies one of the many charts he is holding , then goes to POSEYO . DR . STARK How do you feel this morning , Poseyo ? POSEYO Fine , thank you . DR . STARK Sleep all right ? POSEYO Little bit . p. 33 DR . STARK Any severe pain ? POSEYO Not much . DR . STARK ( To the NURSE ) Same treatment . ( He goes to GEORGIE ) How do you feel , Georgie Porgie ? PORGIE ( As to an equal ) Ignorant but still hungry . DR . STARK ( Trying to smile ) I can go along with you halfway . I 'm scarcely ever hungry any more . ( To the NURSE ) Same . ( He goes to GREEDY ) How are you this morning ? REED I feel all right . DR . STARK Sleep all right ?

STARK Helps me a little to know what to do for you . ( He writes something on a piece of paper , hands it to the NURSE , then turns toward ANDY . ) REED Doctor  --  DR . STARK ( Looking at chart ) Yes ? REED ( Almost stuttering ) How  --  how long  --  DR . STARK From what I know so far , I 'd say you 're doing all right . REED ( Relieved ) Yes , sir . Thank you , sir . DR . STARK ( Looking at GREEDY ) Just try to pass the time pleasantly . Try not to get excited . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice low and soft ) Yes , sir . DR . STARK ( To ANDY ) How are you , Andy Boy ? ANDY BOY All right , I guess . DR . STARK Any trouble getting out of bed this morning ? ANDY BOY Yes , sir . DR . STARK More than yesterday morning ? p. 35 ANDY BOY Yes , sir . DR . STARK Sleep all right last night ? ANDY BOY No , sir . DR . STARK ( Studying the chart ) Sleep at all ? ANDY BOY A little , I guess . DR . STARK Why did n't you call the Nurse ? ANDY BOY ( Slowly ; softly ) I do n't know . I guess I was afraid to . I guess I was afraid if I took some medicine to put me to sleep , I would n't wake up again . I been having a lot of bad dreams . Animals  --  all kinds of animals coming after me . ( Pause . ) DR . STARK Nurse , will you please see if Doctor Bohan 's still in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room . The DOCTOR notices the dictionary ) Reading the dictionary ? ANDY BOY Yes , sir . REED We reading the dictionary from the first word to the last . DR . STARK How many words have you read so far ? REED Andy Boy 's read me six or seven so far , I guess . We been taking them slow and easy , talking about them as we go along . p. 36 DR . STARK How do you like the words ? REED Oh , they 're fine . They 're mighty handsome when you find out what they mean . DR . STARK ( To ANDY ) How do you like them ? ANDY BOY They 're all right , I guess . Greedy Reed asked me to read the dictionary to him . DR . STARK Greedy Reed ? ( To GREEDY ) Who gave you that name ? REED I give it to myself , Doctor . DR . STARK Just lately or long ago ? REED Long , long ago , Doctor . I been greedy all my life . DR . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( To ANDY ) Doctor Bohan and I may want to try to make you a little more comfortable , if it 's all right with you . ANDY BOY I 'm afraid of the animals , Doctor . DR . STARK Yes , I know . If you like we can let things go as they are . ANDY BOY ( Slowly ) Could we let things go as they are for a month ? DR . STARK You would n't be very comfortable , I 'm afraid . p. 37 ANDY BOY How long would it take to make me comfortable ? DR . STARK Well , if we 're lucky , a couple of hours . Three , at the most . ANDY BOY If we 're not lucky , how long will it take ? DR . STARK If we 're not lucky  --  I think you ought to know we may not be lucky . Perhaps you should n't take a chance . ANDY BOY Yes , sir.The DAY NURSE and DR . BOHAN , a sharp , swift young man , come in . DR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DR . BOHAN studies for some time . DR . STARK What do you think ? DR . BOHAN I 'd say take a chance . ( To ANDY ) What do you say son ? You 're the boss , you know . It would help us a lot if you made your decision now , though . ( He looks at his wrist watch . ) ANDY BOY ( Softly , to GREEDY ) I do n't know what to say . I guess I 'd like to read the dictionary all right . I could read some of it anyway , I guess . ( Pause ) I do n't know what to say . REED ( Softly ) Maybe you better get comfortable , Andy Boy . ( He looks from one doctor to the other ) Maybe you better let the Doctors make you a little more comfortable . If we going to read the whole dictionary , Andy Boy , maybe you better take a chance . p. 38 ANDY BOY ( To the DOCTOR , after a long pause ) I 'll take a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his feet . ) DAY NURSE goes out , leaving door open . DR . STARK Better sit still . It 's much too far to walk . ( To POSEYO , as the DAY NURSE pushes a stretcher on wheels into the room ) All right , Poseyo , put the record on the machine and let 's have a little music . REED ( Helping ANDY get on the stretcher ) That 's right , Poseyo . Let 's have the music to the words Andy Boy going to read just as soon as the Doctors make him more comfortable.ANDY is helped onto the stretcher as POSEYO puts needle to disc . The record is Asch Records No. 4101 A Side 1 , Masquerade Suite by Khatchaturian , Valse , Santa Monica Symphony , conducted by Jacques Rachmilovich . BRICK comes in and he and GEORGIE stand behind GREEDY , looking down at ANDY . REED I 'd like to go along with my friend and keep him company , Doctor . DR . STARK No , I think you better stay here and take things easy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , Andy Boy , you hear ? You go along with the Doctors now and get comfortable and come right back . I be here waiting for you with the dictionary . Man , we going to read the whole book . You remember how all the different people say Mamma and Pappa ! You go along now and come right back and see me sitting over there at the table with the dictionary right in front of me , waiting . You come back and we start reading the words again . ( The DAY NURSE and the DOCTORS move with the stretcher out of the room . At the door ANDY sits up and turns around ) You come back , you hear ? You come back , Andy Boy . You come right back . ( He looks around at GEORGIE , BRICK and POSEYO. ) p. 39 p. 40 Act 1 , Scene 2 Scene II It is sundown now . The room is almost dark in spite of the faint streak of red in the light from the sinking sun . The red is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it . The MEN seem smaller and more insignificant than ever , perhaps because their shadows are so much larger now than themselves . They seem strangely unaccountable , too , as if they were being noticed by the eye for the first time ; and the place seems overtaken by a coldness which can only increase . One almost feels the iciness of approaching death , so that the room , in spite of its gaudy trappings , seems a painfully fantastic place in which to spend one 's last hours . POSEYO is sitting in front of the phonograph , listening to his favorite music . GEORGIE is sitting at his table , looking at a comic book . BRICK moves silently back and forth in front of the window , stopping now and then to look out , or to look with amazement at someone in the room . GREEDY is sitting at his table , looking into the open dictionary at the words he can not read , fretting about the man he hopes is going to come back and read them to him . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " " Pappa , " then waves his right arm slowly over the book , an action which has the effect of restoring some of his irrepressible humor . REED Look here , Georgie Porgie ! Look at this . ( He waves his arm again ) Who do like this ? p. 41 PORGIE Do it again . REED Now watch ! ( He waves again ) Who you see do that before ? PORGIE I do n't believe I 've ever seen anybody do that before . REED That 's the Pope , Georgie Porgie . I see him do that in the last newsreel I see . PORGIE Is that so ? REED Yeah . Just like this . ( He performs solemnly ) Why he do that ? Every time I see the Pope he do that . What do the Pope mean when he do that ? PORGIE It 's a kind of blessing , I believe . REED Is that what it is ? Must be , to make a man feel so good . How come everybody do n't do that ? PORGIE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good to do that , too . ( He does it again , and laughs ) What else the Pope do like that ? PORGIE Well , the Pope prays , too . I heard him pray over the radio once . That was away back in 1939 , before the War . He prayed for peace on earth , of course . I heard him say some things in Latin , too . REED I believe Andy Boy read something about Latin this morning . What is that Latin ? p. 42 PORGIE That 's a dead language . REED No fooling ? You know how to talk that dead language , Georgie Porgie ? PORGIE Oh , no . Nobody knows how to talk it ; there 's nobody to talk it to ; but a few people know how to read and write it . REED If nobody talk it , how come the Pope talk it ? Who he talk it to , God ? PORGIE I suppose so . It 's supposed to be a wonderful language , anyway . REED ( Thinking , dreaming ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the Pope talk it . I never even hear of it before . I see the Pope do like this , though . ( He does the imitation ) Seem like I ca n't wait to find out all about these things just as soon as Andy Boy come back . ( Pause ) Big man like the Pope believe in praying , Georgie Porgie . How about you ? PORGIE Oh , it 's better than nothing , I suppose , but I do n't suppose it 's much better . REED Better than nothing but not much better ? ( He does the imitation ) You hit the nail on the head that time , Georgie Porgie , but seem like that nail got such a big head no matter which way you swing you got to hit it . Praying better than nothing but not much better . Pope better than me but not much better . That right ? p. 43 PORGIE Yes , it is , I suppose . REED And you always supposing , too . I suppose this and I suppose that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suppose . ( He does the imitation and bursts into laughter ) Man , I ai n't heard nothing like that before . ( Suddenly ) Make me hungry . PORGIE Hungry ? Why ? REED Why ? Because all that I-suppose-I-suppose stuff make me feel dead and gone before I am dead and gone . Make me feel all of a sudden maybe I ai n't never been alive . Make me feel it was n't me who do all that poor living in the first place . I suppose , I suppose . Which was me back there and which was not me ? Which is me now and which ai n't ? ( Slight pause ) Answer me that , Georgie Porgie . PORGIE Ah , nuts . This morning you woke me up out of the best dream I ever had . Now you keep asking me all these foolish questions . REED You mean that dream about Coca-Cola ? PORGIE Yes , Coca-Cola . Once upon a time I must have had a drink of Coca-Cola that made me feel I could never die and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to die  --  now that I 'm as ignorant as it 's possible for any man to be  --  well , I had to go to work and remember my one good moment . p. 44 REED You ai n't as ignorant as me . PORGIE Oh , yes , I am . Who else has ever come to the end of his life , haunted by the memory of Coca-Cola ? REED What 's Coca-Cola ? I 'll go get you a bottle from the machine in the hall right now . PORGIE No , thanks . I had a bottle this afternoon . It 's not the same . Oh , the Coca-Cola 's the same all right , but I 'm not . ( Pause ) I was the same in the dream , though . I could hear the carpenters hammering the nails in the wood , making a house half a mile away . And I was just sitting there on the porch , breathing . I was n't thinking . I was just there . REED How old was you ? PORGIE ( Very clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was forever . I was the original . And I 'm not the original any more . REED Who is the original ? PORGIE Oh , a couple of hundred million kids some place or other , out in the right weather , and I wish to God every one of them could have the weather forever . REED ( Amazed ) Yeah . PORGIE ( Suddenly ) Listen ! You want Andy Boy to come back , do n't you ? p. 45 REED ( Softly ) You know damn well I want him to come back , Georgie Porgie . You know the worse I feel the more I carry on , the way I been carrying on , doing like the Pope do , and all that  --  and that 's another thing I ca n't figure out . Here I am sitting over the dictionary this way , looking at the words I ca n't read , asking every minute what 's happened to Andy Boy , at the same time waving my arm around like I see the Pope do in the last newsreel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every now and then laughing , too . What license I got to laugh ? Why I laugh at a time like this , Georgie Porgie ? PORGIE Because you feel good . REED No ! Mostly I feel bad , Georgie Porgie . Only when I do like the Pope  --  like this  --  I feel good . I guess that 's because he such a big important man and I such a little no-account one , doing the same thing . Average Pope live a long time , live longer than me , but sooner or later every Pope got to go along , too , just as if he ai n't no bigger than the smallest man in the world , and that make me feel good . That 's what make me laugh and carry on the way I been doing , but I know that ai n't right ! PORGIE Well , it ai n't wrong , either . Anyhow , if you want Andy Boy to come back , I think you 'd better say a prayer for him . REED ( Slowly ) Yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Andy Boy . Let me see now . p. 46 PORGIE ( Helping ) Our Father  --  REED No , no , that ai n't no prayer for Andy Boy . I got to remember about that Mamma and Pappa stuff he read to me this morning . ( Trying to remember ) Pappa ! ( He looks upward as if in prayer ) Get in the sleep of Andy Boy , lying alone in the ether room , help him win the fight  --  a little more air and a little more light . ( He imitates the Pope , then turns to GEORGIE ) You hear that , Georgie Porgie ? PORGIE Yeah , but go ahead , pray some more . REED Mamma ! Give back to Andy Boy his abdomen  --  stomach , liver , kidneys , all of it  --  let him be comfortable . Christ , I still got mine  --  right here . ( He pats his belly , then imitates the Pope . ) PORGIE Ah , go ahead , will you ? REED I just thinking , Georgie Porgie . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he got his whole abdomen until he about to lose everything he got . PORGIE All right , so you 've got your whole abdomen . Finish your prayer for Andy Boy , will you ? REED ( Earnestly ) Yeah . I got to forget my abdomen long enough to pray for every bit of Andy Boy . ( He looks up again , as if in prayer ) Mamma and Pappa  --  both of you  --  bring back my partner for the little time we got left to read the book and learn the way to go.He falls silent , slowly hangs his head , as if in shame , while BRICK moves toward him , and even POSEYO watches . The music is heard clearly now . p. 47 BRICK What 's the matter ? REED ( He turns and speaks softly ) I been having fun , Brick , and now I ashamed . Right now Andy Boy fighting for a few more minutes of life and here I am carrying on , acting like a healthy man . Acting like all the people who ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control at all . I never feel so bad as I feel right now , but here I am having fun . ( Suddenly ) Is this the way to live ? Poseyo , what 's the matter with me , anyway ? POSEYO What ? REED I been thinking all my life black the trouble with me , but black ai n't the trouble with me at all . Lots of good men black . Lots of good men white , red , or some other color . Color ai n't the trouble with me or anybody else . Something else the trouble with me . Who fool around with me this way all the time , make me carry on ? Who make me ornery ? Who make me proud of my abdomen right here in this sad place , at this sad time , Poseyo ? POSEYO Who ? REED Man , I wish I know . I wish I know who do that to me . I wish I know why . Time come to pray for my friend , and I pray like a man laughing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here I am still proud of the little things I got that somebody else ai n't got . Somebody make me ornery long enough . From now I going to be the boss of this here black man , and I tell him right now get on his knees like this , and pray for Andy Boy like a man . ( He kneels at the table. ) p. 48 BRICK Andy Boy 's going to be all right . REED ( Earnestly ) Ah , that 's nice of you to say that , Brick . Sure he 's going to be all right . And when I know he 's going to be all right I going to know I going to be all right , too . And I going to know something else , too . I going to know friendship way down deep inside that ornery secret we all trying to figure out , and I going to thank God for letting me know at the last minute , in the nick of time . I going to know friendship deeper and stronger in that ornery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything else put together maybe , and I going to hate no more , trouble my heart no more to get even . Get even on who ? People ? Why , people need somebody to pray for them . Every one of them need somebody to pray for him , even the Pope , doing like this . ( He does the imitation without pleasure ) Pope ai n't no better off than any of us , either  --  all that church work to do . From now on I boss me , nobody else . What the boss say , I got to do , and now the boss say pray for Andy Boy . ( DAY NURSE comes in , holding a drinking-glass containing half a dozen thermometers in alcohol ) Nurse , I fixing to pray for Andy Boy right now , but tell me first , how is he ? DAY NURSE He 's as well as might be expected under the circumstances . p. 49 PORGIE You mean he 's dying ? DAY NURSE ( Placing a thermometer in GEORGIE 'S mouth ) Now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Andy Boy . He 's in good hands and if his life can be saved , Doctor Bohan will save it . ( She places a thermometer in POSEYO 'S mouth , then in BRICK 'S , then in GREEDY 'S . ) PORGIE He had a good month to live without any help from Doctor Bohan . DAY NURSE Never mind trying to talk with the thermometer in your mouth , Georgie Porgie . You can all just be quiet for a minute or two while I take your temperatures.POSEYO 'S music is heard while the DAY NURSE holds each man 's wrist and looks at her wristwatch , taking their pulses , after which she removes the thermometers from their mouths , examines them , writes on each of their charts , beginning with GEORGIE . PORGIE You do n't think Andy Boy 's got a chance , do you ? DAY NURSE Now , you be quiet , Georgie Porgie . I did n't say he has n't got a chance . PORGIE ( To GREEDY ) Well , if you 're going to pray , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it good this time.GREEDY tries to say something . p. 50 DAY NURSE ( Removing the thermometer from POSEYO 'S mouth , turning to GREEDY ) Never mind trying to talk just yet , please . ( She examines POSEYO 'S thermometer . Then removes the thermometer from BRICK 'S mouth . She examines the thermometer , looks at BRICK curiously , at the thermometer again , then touches his forehead ) I think you 'd better get to bed . BRICK No , I always get a little fever about this hour of the day . DAY NURSE It 's not a little fever , I 'm afraid . BRICK This happens every evening . I 'm all right . DAY NURSE Well , you know where your bed is . You 'll be wanting it soon enough , I can tell you that , and I 'll be around later on with some pills . As long as you are up , though , see that you keep quiet . I would n't have any louder music than the music you 're listening to now , Poseyo . PORGIE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't hear it any more . DAY NURSE I hear it , and I must say it 's quite nice . ( She removes GREEDY 'S thermometer ) What is it ? REED ( Glum and troubled ) That 's Mozart . p. 51 DAY NURSE It is ? Now , all of you be nice and quiet , will you ? Poseyo , you did n't eat your supper again . Who did ? REED ( Raising his hand like a schoolboy ) Me . Greedy Reed . DAY NURSE Poseyo ought to eat a little more . You ought to try to get him to eat a little more instead of gobbling up everything on his tray . REED Yes , ma'am . DAY NURSE See that you eat your breakfast in the morning , Poseyo . I 'm not sure you should n't get to bed , Brick . BRICK No , I 'm all right . DAY NURSE Georgie Porgie , look after Brick , will you ? If Doctor Bohan were n't already so overworked I 'd ask him to come in and have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Anybody want anything ? ( Pause ) All right , then , no excitement , please . ( She goes out , sliding the door shut behind her . ) PORGIE What 's the matter with you , Brick ? BRICK I never told you I used to ride in the amateur bike races , did I ? PORGIE No , you never did . BRICK Well , I used to . p. 52 PORGIE That 's good . Why do n't you sit down ? BRICK ( Looking straight ahead at nothing , as if in a trance ) I never cared much for the sprints , but I used to like the distance races . Fifty miles , a hundred miles , a hundred and fifty , two hundred . I never cared much about winning , either . I just liked to ride . There was a race one summer when I was sixteen or seventeen from Fresno to San Francisco , up Highway 99 , two hundred miles . I got off to a good start , with the nearest riders about half a mile down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hot morning in August and it was all I could do to keep from hollering at the top of my lungs , I felt so good . Seemed like I just could n't get tired . By the time I got to Merced I could n't see any of the other racers at all . I felt glad to be out in front that way and all alone , but pretty soon I got lonesome  --  lonesome for the rest of the guys in the race , I thought  --  so I slowed down and let three of them pacing along together catch up with me . I got in with them and we paced along together , talking and telling jokes , but pretty soon I felt lonesomer than ever , so I picked up a swifter pace and moved out in front again . By the time I got to Modesto I could n't see them , and I was n't even beginning to get tired , so it looked as if I ought to win the race easy . It was one of those Sundays you see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and very still . You could hear little noises from far away as if they were from real close , like a screen door banging , or some kid hollering out to another . There 's a small park in Modesto where they have a band concert Sunday afternoons in the summer , and I had been hearing the band four or five minutes when I reached the park . The band was playing something I seemed to know that I had n't heard in years , and the park was full of girls . There must have been three or four dozen of them at least : all kinds of American girls , and all kinds of Mexican and Portuguese and Japanese and Negro girls , and I went riding around the park looking at them instead of racing . I kept trying to remember the words of the song the band was playing , and then finally I remembered them . ( He tries to sing ) " You know you belong to somebody else , so why do n't you leave me alone ? " ( He whistles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys racing behind me reached the park , and there I was sitting under a tree instead of racing , because I loved every girl in the park . ( Pause ) Well , that 's the way I feel now.He looks around , whistling the song softly , then goes out slowly , shutting the door behind him . EVERYBODY remains silent a moment , as POSEYO turns the volume dial up and the music is heard softly but clearly . p. 53 PORGIE ( Suddenly to GREEDY , who 's been kneeling at the table all this time . He speaks powerfully ) All right , you heard what the nurse said . If you 're going to pray , get going , before it 's too late . REED ( His voice hushed ) I been praying all the time , Georgie Porgie . I praying now . PORGIE I do n't hear you praying . REED I ai n't using words this time , Georgie Porgie . The boss tell me to pray with everything I got  --  abdomen and all  --  and it do n't come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about that bike race and the park in Modesto and the girls there . Seem like the words Brick say was a prayer . Maybe when Andy Boy come back and read me the dictionary I learn some words good enough for a real prayer for everybody , white and black and red and man and woman and rich and poor and strong and weak and everything else , but right now I do n't know any words for a prayer like that . PORGIE ( Standing ) O.K. , O.K. , I 'll read the dictionary to you until Andy Boy comes back . I 'm half blind , but I can still see good enough to read , I guess . REED That 's awful nice of you , Georgie Porgie . You know I dying to hear the words in the dictionary , but I could n't doublecross my partner that way . What kind of partner I be if I go ahead and let somebody else read the dictionary while he fighting for his life ? Andy Boy 's got to read the words . Nobody else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ REED Ah , Georgie Porgie , why you say that ? Why you go to work and jinx Andy Boy that way ? The boss got me kneeling here this way praying for him with all my might . Why you even let yourself think maybe he ai n't coming back ? That ai n't right , Georgie Porgie . He got to come back . PORGIE It was n't his idea to read the dictionary in the first place . It was your idea . REED What that got to do with it ? PORGIE Plenty . Was n't I telling you this morning about one of the theories of personal continuity ? REED No , Georgie Porgie . You tell me something about everybody in this world being here from long ago , and everybody leaving this world maybe coming back again . PORGIE That 's one of the theories of personal continuity . Well , there 's another theory about another matter , too . REED What theory about what matter that ? PORGIE The theory about the matter of dying . This theory says nobody dies until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know Andy Boy ai n't willing to die right now , in spite of your praying ? I do n't mean the Andy Boy we see on the outside , I mean the one we do n't see  --  the man in you that you call the boss . I mean the man in Andy Boy who 's come back to this world so many times he 's sick and tired of it . A man 's got to have something going to keep him from being willing to die , and according to this theory as long as a man has got something going , he just naturally ca n't die , no matter how sick he is . In other words , the theory says you die when you yourself are willing to die , and not before  --  not even by accident . It 's a theory , of course , but everything we believe is a theory . All right , suppose Andy Boy just ai n't got anything going to keep him from being willing to die ? Suppose he does n't care about reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use kidding ourselves ? Maybe he does n't want to bother about anything any more . p. 55 REED Georgie Porgie , how you expect me , a religious man , kneeling here in prayer right now , know what you talking about ? Religious man like me ai n't got no brains . Friendship all I got , and right now my best friend dying and I praying for him because I give him my word . The boss tell me not to break my word , Georgie Porgie . He tell me to pray for Andy Boy until he come back , and that 's what I doing . Andy Boy going to read the dictionary , nobody else . PORGIE ( Sitting down ) O.K. , have it your way , but I think you 're keeping another friend from a good chance to round out his poor life by doing something generous and unselfish . REED Who that ? PORGIE Me , that 's who . Do n't you think it would make my last hours easier if I felt I was making you happy by reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand so much peculiar friendship all of a sudden , Georgie Porgie . The dictionary stand up there on that shelf all the time . Nobody open it . When I look for something right to do before I go , and find the dictionary , nobody volunteer to read it to me . PORGIE Did Andy Boy volunteer ? REED No , but sick as he was he accept my invitation right away . This morning when I invite Brick and you to sit down and play a little casino , you turn me down , make me feel cheap and black . Man , I do n't understand this brand-new friendship you talking about . p. 56 PORGIE People ai n't necessarily the same in the evening as they were in the morning . I 'll just read some of it , too , and I can rest and listen . And then when Andy Boy comes back , he can read as much of it as he likes , or he can rest , too , and listen while Brick reads . We 're all friends . REED @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say ai n't right . I know it ai n't right because the boss tell me so . He tell me not to break the word I give Andy Boy . Nobody else going to read the dictionary . Lots of books over there on that shelf . Anybody want to read , let him read one of them books , not the dictionary . I kneeling here in prayer for Andy Boy with the open dictionary in front of me waiting for him to win his fight and come back and read the words , just like I promise him . PORGIE I can see you have n't learned very much from the words he read you this morning . REED What you mean , Georgie Porgie ? PORGIE You 're still the same man you always were . You just ai n't willing to let something good happen to anybody but yourself . You 're getting a lot of pleasure out of kneeling and praying for Andy Boy and not letting me read the dictionary . You 're still getting even . Keeping the dictionary for Andy Boy is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all . It 's not an act of friendship or understanding , it 's an act of revenge . Like all religious fanatics you feel sorry for yourself alone . You do n't care what happens to anybody else just so you can find out how to become willing to die . Well , I 'm trying to find out , too , and I ai n't got much time . It 's true you discovered the dictionary , but that do n't mean you got to keep me from reading it . ( Suddenly ) Unless of course you do n't want to have the dictionary read to you at all . Unless you 're just building up all that stuff so you can enjoy feeling sorry for Andy Boy and yourself and anybody else whose skin happens to be something like the color of yours . Maybe you do n't want to have the dictionary read to you at all . p. 57 REED Ah , what you talking about , Georgie Porgie ? What you trying to make me feel low and crooked for ? ( Painfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What you twisting everything around for ? I been feeling almost decent kneeling here , trying to pray these few minutes , but you spoiling it all , making a monkey out of me , and the boss tell me that ai n't right . You playing games on a ignorant man , Georgie Porgie . PORGIE I 'm not playing games , you are ! You keep putting yourself over to one side , away from Brick and me . You 're hogging the dictionary because your skin and Andy Boy 's skin is darker than ours , and because you 're proud  --  yes , proud  --  that you  --  a black man who ca n't even read  --  discovered in this miserable place the only occupation for the anxious heart and the troubled mind that can soothe them both , and let a man turn away from this world of his own free will instead of having his life forced out of him as if he were an insect , or had never lived at all . Now , is n't that so ? REED No , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , Georgie Porgie . You talk and talk and make me feel low and crooked , kneeling here , but what you say ai n't so , Georgie Porgie . Reading the dictionary Andy Boy 's job , and nobody going to take his job away from him . You saw him sit up and turn around when they wheel him out of here this morning . He look at me , to tell me to keep my word , and he look at the dictionary , to see the way it lie here on this table , the way it going to lie here when he come back to go on reading . Everything got to be the same when he come back . Now I ai n't going to talk no more . I ai n't going to listen no more , Georgie Porgie . I going to pray , and pretty soon you going to see the nurse come and say Andy Boy going to be all right , Andy Boy going to come back . ( He shuts his eyes , folds his hands , bows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your sake , then , I hope he does come back . REED ( His eyes shut , softly ) Oh , he coming back all right . ( POSEYO shuts off the phonograph . GREEDY speaks softly without opening his eyes ) Why you stop the music , Poseyo ? POSEYO I go lie down now . ( He goes . ) REED ( Softly ) Seem like I ca n't pray no more . I still trying to pray , Andy Boy , but seem like I need some help from Mozart , or Brick telling about the bike race that time he fell in love with all the girls , or even Georgie Porgie badgering me to let him take your place at the dictionary . Seem like a man need a lot of help , one kind another , to say a decent prayer even , Andy Boy . I just ca n't pray worth a damn all alone this way , so I going to get up off my knees now and go look for help . Amen . ( He opens his eyes , unfolds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the desk , and notices GEORGIE lost in the comic book ) If I say anything wrong while I praying , Georgie Porgie , I sorry . PORGIE ( Abstractedly ) What ? REED I say I sorry . p. 59 PORGIE ( Still looking in the book ) What for ? REED If I say anything wrong while I praying . ( Pause ) Seem awful cold around here now without Mozart and Poseyo and Brick and Andy Boy . Almost make me shiver , so cold around here now . Cold and dark . You want me to switch on the lights , so you can see what you looking at there ? PORGIE No , I kind of like the dark , and I know these pictures by heart anyway . REED I going out to ask the nurse about Andy Boy now . You want me to fetch you something ? A Coca-Cola , maybe ? PORGIE No , thanks . REED I done my best . PORGIE What ? REED Praying for Andy Boy , I mean . ( Softly ) Seem awful cold around here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Porgie ? PORGIE Why should I be mad at you ? REED I feel awful cold , Georgie Porgie . Seem like somebody mad at me . PORGIE I 'm not . Let me know what the nurse tells you about Andy Boy . REED Yeah . I let you know , Georgie Porgie . ( Pause ) When you hear the workmen hammering them nails in the wood , how come that make you feel so good ? p. 60 PORGIE I told you how come . I was somebody who was forever . I was the original . The whole place was for me . Everything was made for me . Everything belonged to me . REED Yeah . ( Pause ) I feel awful cold , Georgie Porgie . Seem like lots of freezing and dying going on around here . ( He goes out. ) @x GEORGIE waits until the door is shut by GREEDY REED , then gets up quickly and goes to the dictionary . He looks down at the words , trying to see if he can make them out , then hurries to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are very dim . He goes back to the dictionary and again tries to make out the words , moving his head closer and closer to the page . He lifts his head suddenly , shakes it , rubs his good eye , tries again , but is obviously unable to make out the words . He thinks about this a moment , then goes back to his table , sits down , and takes up the comic book , whistling BRICK 'S song softly . BRICK comes into the room , slides the door shut behind him , goes to the window and looks out , as GEORGIE watches with interest . PORGIE I thought you went to bed . BRICK Well , I did n't . PORGIE I was afraid you were n't going to be able to get out here any more . BRICK Is that so ? PORGIE Yeah . The nurse scared me , and so did that story of yours about the bike race . It was all I could do to keep things alive for myself playing games on poor Greedy Reed . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boy . Now that you 're back , though , I do n't feel so bad . ( Slight pause ) Got any more stories ? p. 62 BRICK No , just the one . PORGIE You 'd think we 'd all have dozens of stories . Take the twenty years or so I gambled for a living . There was n't one day that was n't full of accidents of luck that only I knew about , that I thought I 'd want to tell somebody about some day , but I 'll be damned if any of it seems worth telling now . ( He waits a moment for BRICK to say something , then goes on easily ) There was a place on O'Farrell Street where I was always good for a couple of hundred dollars ' credit . Many times I sat down to a game of stud with nothing to my name but my guts , and five or six hours later got up rich enough to spend a whole year loafing and traveling first-class , the way I 'd always wanted to do but never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to my name again would be my guts . ( Slight pause ) But there it is  --  it just does n't seem to be worth telling now . I always wanted to loaf and travel , though . ( He watches BRICK at the window , then goes on softly ) I say , I always wanted to loaf and travel , though . BRICK I heard you . ( Pause . ) PORGIE Well , if you do n't feel like talking , I 'm glad you 're going to be up and about for a while longer yet , anyway . BRICK Thanks . ( Pause. ) p. 63 PORGIE Poseyo turned off the phonograph and went to bed , but I do n't think it 's anything serious . He 'll be out here in the morning before anybody else , the same as ever , most likely . ( He pauses ever so slightly for some show of interest , then goes on , determined to draw BRICK out ) As far as I 'm concerned , I never expected to live almost fifty years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believed I did n't have more than another year to go at the most . That 's when I started gambling . There 's a lot of fast living in one night of gambling , let alone a whole year of it , and it 's the kind of living that takes you pretty close to  --  whatever 's next . After I was forty , though , I began to believe I could go on living as long as I felt like it , because one day was exactly like another , and I had forgotten all about noticing time going by , the way you do before you 're twenty . And then all of a sudden I felt I 'd lost something somewhere along the line . Not time or money  --  something else . That 's when I quit gambling . Of course I did n't know I 'd quit when I had . I just found myself spending a lot of time not gambling . I began to sleep a lot more than I had been sleeping . I 'd stayed in some games as long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to win a little , so of course I 'd missed a lot of sleep . After I 'd caught up on my sleep , I began to read . Newspapers at first , then magazines , and finally books  --  from the public library . I guess I was looking for what I 'd lost . I once read a whole book about bacteriology , for instance . I remember reading about a man named Noguchi who lost his life trying to find out something or other . Seemed kind of strange and  --  handsome  --  that a man could be that interested in something . Finally , I found out why I 'd quit gambling . It was because I hated enslavement of any kind , especially the enslavement that comes from having to work for a living  --  for money , I mean , so you can keep your body warm and alive , so you can stay enslaved a little longer . I did n't like that at all , but that was exactly what had happened to me , gambling , so I quit . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years of gambling , too . I 'd lost the memory of ever having been out in the weather . ( Almost laughing ) That does n't seem like much to lose , but it 's really a hell of a lot  --  everything maybe . I got it back this morning in that Coca-Cola dream I had . You 'd think a man about to die would have something better to remember . ( Slight pause ) Are you listening to me at all ? p. 64 BRICK Sure I 'm listening . PORGIE I 'll shut up if you want me to . BRICK No , I do n't mind listening . PORGIE Well , anyway , I 'll never forget the corny remarks professional gamblers used to make to some sucker who 'd gone broke . They never got tired of saying , " Easy come , easy go , " for instance . The fellow might be a stevedore or a bricklayer with a week 's wages pissed away , and an anxious wife and maybe a couple of hungry kids to go home to without any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to laugh at the corny remark , but anybody could see how hurt he was . I always felt sorry for workingmen trying to get hold of easy money . BRICK So what ? PORGIE Nothing . I just hate enslavement of any kind , that 's all . ( Slight pause ) Maybe you ought to go to bed after all , like the nurse said . Maybe you 're worse off than you think . BRICK No , I 'm all right . PORGIE ( Eager to keep the talk going at any cost , swiftly ) The nurse did n't think so . What makes you think so ? BRICK Oh , I know I 'm all right  --  now . PORGIE Now ? What do you know now that you did n't know when the nurse took your temperature ? p. 65 BRICK I know how I 'm going to spend the rest of my life . PORGIE Is that so ? How ? ( Pause . ) BRICK I 'm going to stand here until I see the lights go on at Alcatraz . PORGIE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you going to do ? BRICK Then I 'm going to sit down at the piano . PORGIE After that , what are you going to do ? BRICK After that , I 'm going to go back and look at Alcatraz some more . PORGIE What are you always looking at Alcatraz for ? ( The conversation collapses . There is a long pause ) What 's the matter ? I said , what are you always looking at Alcatraz for ? BRICK And I said , I heard you . PORGIE Something 's the matter with you besides fever . What the hell is it ? BRICK Play your little games on Greedy Reed . He 'll be back in a minute . PORGIE You 're worse off than I thought . I 'm not playing any games . Why should n't I be on the level with you ? BRICK I do n't know , unless it 's because you ca n't be on the level with anybody , even yourself . p. 66 PORGIE Oh , I 'm on the level with myself all right , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the level with yourself , you 'd get in bed and stay there instead of hanging around out here , stalling for time . You 're as far gone as anybody in bed . You just want more time . ( Pause ) More time for what , though ? PORGIE I 'd like to know how Andy Boy makes out , for one thing . BRICK Andy Boy 's dead . You know it and I know it , so who do we think we 're kidding ? PORGIE He may be , and then again he may not be . I 'd like to know for sure . BRICK You just have n't got guts enough to give up , that 's all . PORGIE Why do n't you sit down at the piano , like you said you were going to do after you saw the lights go on at Alcatraz ? BRICK I did n't see the lights go on . I missed seeing them go on because I was talking to you . Now they 're on , but I did n't see them go on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clothes you were wearing when you came here a month ago and walk out of here , like you said this morning you could do any time you felt like it ? Why do n't you do that , as long as you 're asking me why I do n't do this and that ? p. 67 PORGIE I do n't feel like it . I feel like sitting here and looking at these pictures of Joe Palooka . BRICK I do n't believe you 've ever looked at those pictures . ( Suddenly , desperately ) Christ , ca n't we get out of here ? Ca n't we go to a bar on Pacific Avenue and drink ourselves to death ? PORGIE Ah , sit down at the piano . BRICK I 'm sick and tired of hanging on . I 'm sick and tired of having you provoke me into hanging on . What are you doing it for all the time ? Three weeks ago when I got here I expected to get in bed and stay there and let it go at that , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me out here to this God-forsaken room and provoke me into forgetting I 'm dead . PORGIE I 've got to have somebody intelligent to talk to , do n't I ? I 've got to have somebody with a little sense in his head to listen to me , do n't I ? BRICK Pick on somebody else from now on . You wo n't get me out of bed tomorrow . PORGIE I 'll try . I got you out of bed this morning . You heard me make up all kinds of lies about Poseyo , so Greedy Reed would get out of bed , too . I want anybody who comes to this ward to get out of bed as long as possible . BRICK ( Whispering desperately ) I wish to Christ I was in a bar on Pacific Avenue ! p. 68 PORGIE You 'll be all right . ( BRICK sits at the piano , begins to play his song softly ) I did n't know you could play the piano . ( He listens a moment . Suddenly BRICK stands , clutching his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't get excited ! Take it easy ! You 'll be all right again in a minute . Hang onto the piano . ( BRICK sprawls over the piano , hanging on and trying not to moan ) That 's right . Hang on . That pain ai n't going to last forever . BRICK ( In terrible pain ) I wish to Christ I was in a whorehouse on Pacific Avenue . PORGIE Take it easy ! You 'll be all right in a minute . BRICK Oh , Christ ! It 's too late now ! ( Suddenly ) Help me ! Help me to my bed , will you ? PORGIE You 'll be all right in a minute , I tell you ! BRICK No ! This is it ! Oh , Jesus , this is too much pain for one man . PORGIE You do n't know what pain is ! You 've got to have it in the head to know what it is . BRICK Oh , Christ , cut it out , will you ? You know you 're in no pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain ) Oh , Mamma , Mamma , Mamma ! ( He stops writhing ; whispers ) Help me to bed , Georgie Porgie , for the love of God ! Get the nurse . Get me something for this pain ! I promise to get out of bed in the morning . p. 69 PORGIE Oh , no , I 'm not going to fall for that ! If you 're going to kick the bucket , kick it out here like a man , not in bed like a baby looking for Mamma to rock him to sleep . You ai n't finished yet , but you will be if you take any pills the nurse gives you . Most of your pain 's gone now , anyway , is n't it ? BRICK ( Moaning ) No ! Jesus ! No ! PORGIE I began having attacks like that two weeks ago . The first one scares you a lot , but that 's about all . You 've got plenty of time . Let yourself go , though , and you 're gone , that 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . Keep it to yourself . You 'll be all right again before you know it , wait and see , and then you 'll really know what living is . This is only the first attack . You wo n't have another until tomorrow night maybe , or the next , but you 've still got at least half a dozen more coming if you do n't let yourself go , so do n't let yourself go . I could keep Andy Boy going longer than the Doctors ever could if I knew how to talk to him . Anybody knows we 're past help in the body . The Doctors just do n't know how to give us any other kind of help . I 'm finding out how , though . I can still help myself , at any rate , and if you 'll hang on a little longer and listen to me , I can help you , too . I swear to God I can . What can you lose ? Turn yourself over to the hospital  --  tell them about this  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Do n't go to bed and die . Stay here . I 'll help you find out how to help yourself . p. 70 BRICK Do n't stop talking , Georgie Porgie . For God 's sake , keep talking . Just keep talking . Recite the alphabet . Say anything . I 'm listening . I ca n't think straight any more , but I know I need more time  --  just a little more time  --  so keep talking , will you ? ( Moaning painfully ) Oh , Jesus , Jesus , Jesus . PORGIE Sure you need a little more time . A man never needs time the way you and I need it now . Time never means very much until it 's this kind of time  --  time that we make ourselves , out of nerve and guts , for ourselves . There 's a lot of anesthesia in every one of us when we 're hurt and mad this way , and it 's the only anesthesia that works when we 're past getting help for our bodies . BRICK Keep talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my guts . Keep talking . Keep talking . PORGIE Do n't worry , I 'll keep talking . I 've got pain of my own to get rid of , you know . Your pain 's in a bad place but not as bad as where mine is  --  in the head , behind the eye that 's eaten away , and now  --  Christ , now it 's behind the other eye , too . We belong to the same race for sure now . Pain 's our life , and the anesthesia for both of us is the same now , too  --  arrogance , contempt and hate . Hate for anything and everything , anybody and everybody . That 's all . ( He watches BRICK straighten up slowly . BRICK 'S face is white and wet . GEORGIE speaks softly ) You 'll be O.K. for at least twenty-four hours now , maybe thirty-six or forty-eight . That 's a lot of time , Brick . And I gave it to you . ( Painfully ) I gave it to you because you 're the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to , and the only one who 's going to be able to give me a little help when I 'm not going to be able to help myself any more , when I 'm going to want it and need it most . ( Slight pause ) You all right now ? p. 71 BRICK I 'm a lot better , thanks . My guts still hurt , but not the way they did a little while ago . Something seemed to be tearing them to pieces . I 'm scared . Christ , I 'm scared ! ( He goes to the window . ) PORGIE You 'll get over that in a few minutes , too . ( Long pause ) How do you feel now ? BRICK I ca n't believe I 'm still alive . That pain scared me , Georgie Porgie . I guess I 'm O.K. again for a little while , but what the hell for ? I keep thinking I need a little more time . I keep what 's scaring the hell out of me because I know the only thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the one I just got over . Yeah , I 'm O.K. again for a little while , I guess . So what ? For God 's sake , Georgie Porgie , so what ? ( He goes back to the piano and sits down ) Yeah , I 'm O.K. PORGIE I can see you are . Well , I 'm not O.K. , see ? I got you over your first attack , but this is my ninth or tenth . Yes , and one is worse than the other . I 'm in more pain than you 'll ever know , but that 's all right . BRICK I 'm sorry , Georgie Porgie. p. 72 PORGIE Never mind . I still know how to keep myself alive , and I 've still got guts enough not to need any help from you or anybody else . Tomorrow or the next day when you get your next attack I 'll try to keep you going again . But I 'll go when I get good and ready to go . I 'll go because I 've had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting the bum 's rush . BRICK I 'll help you , Georgie Porgie . I swear to God , I 'll try my best to help you , if you 'll let me . I 've never known how bad it was with you until now . I 'll help you , Georgie Porgie . PORGIE Never mind . I 'll go hating , like I said , because I know what I am  --  what every man is  --  a dirty crook who kids himself into thinking a little measly health entitles him to some kind of life everlasting , and then when his health is gone whimpers and wails and rocks himself back to sleep in Mamma 's big warm lap . I 'll go knowing I 've had my life everlasting  --  one little memory of breathing easily , drinking Coca-Cola . I 'll go the way I want to go , after I 've done everything I want to do , and I still want to do a few more things . BRICK ( Softly , with real sympathy ) Sure , Georgie Porgie . PORGIE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and look down at Alcatraz and feel sorry for yourself p. 73 BRICK ( Looks at him curiously . Softly ) I 'm not standing at the window , Georgie Porgie . PORGIE You 're a dirty liar ! BRICK No , Georgie Porgie . I 'm sitting at the piano . PORGIE ( Standing in anger , pointing at the window ) You 're standing right there at the window . I can see you . BRICK No , I 'm not , Georgie Porgie . I 'm sitting here at the piano . ( Long pause . ) PORGIE ( Very softly ) Touch the keys of the piano if that 's where you are . BRICK Sure , Georgie Porgie.He plays several chords of his song very softly , then stops , as GEORGIE turns to the piano , stares a moment , then slowly sits down . PORGIE ( Whispering ) Oh , Christ ! ( There is a long pause . GEORGIE speaks with power and anger ) All right , I ca n't see . I 'm blind now , too , but everything I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood up , did n't you ? BRICK Yeah , Georgie Porgie . PORGIE Well , I can still see that much , anyway . Sit down and finish playing what you started to play . p. 74 BRICK I 'll help you get around , Georgie Porgie . PORGIE Sit down . Sit down . BRICK I 'll stick by you , Georgie Porgie . ( He sits . ) PORGIE I saw you sit down . I can still see a little . Go ahead , play the piano . BRICK Sure , Georgie Porgie.BRICK plays half a minute or so . He stops when the DAY NURSE comes in with a shy little MAN ( BUSTER ) of fifty or so who appears to be stunned and lonely and on the verge of tears , as lost children are . DAY NURSE ( To the MAN ) This is the Sun Room . It 's not much now , but during the day it 's very nice , and the view from the window is a sight for sore eyes . ( GEORGIE barely winces . ) BUSTER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys get out here any more , so you and these two and one or two others will have the whole place to yourselves  --  piano , phonograph , radio , magazines , books , games , view and all . Do you play the piano ? BUSTER No , ma'am . DAY NURSE Well , it 's there anyway . ( Brightly ) Now do n't be bashful . You 'll find everybody here the same as everybody anywhere else . ( She turns to GEORGIE and BRICK ) Boys , I want you to meet  --  ( She examines the chart she is holding for the man 's name. ) p. 75 BUSTER ( Shyly , softly ) My son calls me Buster . BRICK This is Georgie Porgie , Buster . I 'm Brick . DAY NURSE Now , it 's not going to be half bad , is it ? You 'll find everybody just as nice and friendly as they can be . BUSTER ( Softly ) Yes , ma'am . DAY NURSE We 've got three vacant beds in the ward , boys . Please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you do n't mind , please show him where to put away the clothes he 's wearing and put on the hospital pajamas and robe . Now , you 'll make him feel at home , wo n't you ? BRICK Sure we will . BUSTER ( Almost speechless with sudden panic , almost stammering ) I 'd like to stay in these clothes until bedtime , if I may . ( He brushes a sleeve nervously . ) DAY NURSE Well , it 's not exactly according to hospital regulations , but I do n't think anyone will mind very much . Bedtime 's at nine , so about half-past eight you 'd better let the boys show you around . BUSTER Yes , ma'am . DAY NURSE ( Suddenly , with forced cheerfulness ) My , you 're quiet tonight , Georgie Porgie ! I see you 're still on your feet , Brick . Are you sure you 're all right ? p. 76 BRICK I 'm all right . DAY NURSE Well , all right , if you say so . Night Nurse is up front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of each other . I 'll see you all bright and early in the morning . PORGIE Where 's Greedy Reed ? DAY NURSE Why , he 's in bed , is n't he ? Of course he is . I just saw him lying in bed . PORGIE How long has he been there ? DAY NURSE I do n't know , Georgie Porgie . Why ? PORGIE We had two vacant beds this morning , did n't we ? DAY NURSE ( Softly ) Yes , that 's right , Georgie Porgie . ( Pause . ) PORGIE Well , when did it happen ? DAY NURSE Oh , about an hour ago . ( Slight pause ) Let the Night Nurse know which bed Buster takes , will you please , boys ? PORGIE Sure . He 'll probably take Andy Boy 's . It 's by a window . DAY NURSE Good night , then.The DAY NURSE goes out , sliding the door behind her . BUSTER stands at the window looking out . BRICK goes to the table on which the dictionary lies . He looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at GEORGIE , at BUSTER , and then down at the book again . p. 77 BRICK ( Reading softly ) Abide . To rest . To tarry or stay awhile . To continue . To be firm and immovable . To endure . To suffer the consequences . ( He closes the book ) You want to listen to the radio or anything , Buster ? ( BUSTER does not hear him . After a moment he turns to GEORGIE ) Do you , Georgie Porgie ? PORGIE No , thanks . I just want to sit here and look at these pictures of Joe Palooka . BRICK Sure , Georgie Porgie . PORGIE What are you going to do ? BRICK Abide , I guess . Tarry . Suffer the consequences . PORGIE Why do n't you sit down and read Time or something ? BRICK Sure , Georgie Porgie . ( He gets a copy of Time off a shelf , sits down across the table from GEORGIE ) Time . PORGIE What 's it say ? BRICK ( Turning several pages ) Well , it starts out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BRICK ( Reading , with great effort ) Sir . Time 's definition of the Man of the Year is the man who had the biggest rise in fame during the year and more than anyone else changed the news for better or worse . That man is Secretary of State George C. Marshall . The year 1947 spotlighted his rise to fame from military genius to the even nobler role of defender of human democracy , and the inspiring plan which bears his name is 1947 's most effective challenge to the Russian threat of world domination . Marshall is the Man of the Year , the Marshall Plan is the hope of the world . ( He stops , as if being inwardly attacked by pain again. ) p. 78 PORGIE All right , read some more . What 's the matter ? BRICK ( Softly ) I did n't do a damn thing this year , Georgie Porgie . PORGIE Well , I guess it 's Marshall 's year all right , then . BRICK Oh , I do n't know . ( He stands suddenly , moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his belly ) Listen , Georgie Porgie ! Let 's get out of here quick and die in the world . ( He opens his robe , revealing a tan suit with the trouser cuffs rolled up to his knees ) I 've got my clothes on , and I can get yours , too . You can put them on in the can , the way I did . I 've got twenty dollars , and I know you 've got a little . So what the hell are we waiting for ? Let 's die in the world , Georgie Porgie . We 're still free men . Let 's die as if we did n't have this disease . I know a half dozen places in the North Beach . I ca n't stay here any more . I ca n't stand this silly smell of death any more . I 've got to get out in the streets again . I 've got to smell life again . ( He bends , holding his belly in silent pain , his eyes shut in agony . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listening . ( Pause ) What 's the matter now ? BRICK ( Whispering painfully , staring at GEORGIE ) Ca n't you see at all , Georgie Porgie ? For God 's sake , Georgie Porgie , ca n't you see enough to give me a little help ? I 'm going to need somebody to hold me up every once in awhile . p. 79 PORGIE Take it easy , will you ? You 've got to learn to take it easy ! BRICK ( Almost weeping ) Ah , ca n't you see at all , Georgie Porgie ? I 've got to get out of here . I 'm still a free man . Ca n't you see enough to  --  PORGIE ( Severely , whispering ) Listen to me a minute , will you , Brick ? ( Slight pause ) You 're not up to being free , and neither am I. If we were we would n't be here in the first place . We 're not bodies any more . Bodies are a lot of crap all right , but bodies are where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it or not . We 're not the prison any more , we 're the prisoners . Like the boys on Alcatraz , we spend our time looking at San Francisco and the Golden Gate Bridge . But we ca n't escape from Alcatraz until we 're ready to cross the Bridge , and you know damn well the Bridge does n't go to San Francisco . You know damn well even if you could get to San Francisco , you could n't have any fun because you 'd still be enslaved by your own Alcatraz . The Bridge is next for us , Brick , and I 'm not ready to cross it yet . Now , in the dark , I need you more than ever , so gather yourself together and hang around . BRICK ( Sober now ) Sure , Georgie Porgie . PORGIE Go back to the can , take off your street clothes , put them back where they belong . We 're not up to any more side trips . ( Slight pause ) Go get Greedy Reed out of bed . Get Poseyo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much time as anybody else in the world . ( Softly ) Go get the boys , Brick . p. 80 BRICK Sure , Georgie Porgie . PORGIE ( Slight pause ) Listen , Brick . I know you had another attack a minute ago . BRICK It was n't much . PORGIE You could take some pills and go to bed , you know . BRICK No , I do n't think I want to do that . PORGIE If you feel like going to bed , Brick , go ahead . Do n't stay up on my account . What the hell , it 's no disgrace , it 's just painless , that 's all . I ca n't know how bad it is with you . A lot of new pain has made me irritable , but for God 's sake do n't be a fool . Go to bed if that 's what you want to do , and no hard feelings . BRICK No , I do n't want to go to bed , Georgie Porgie . PORGIE Well , thanks , then . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around here without you . I ca n't see worth a damn any more , and I 'd like to hear you play the piano again . We 've had some laughs , and I swear to God I 've always been on the level with you . That 's the truth , Brick . BRICK Sure it is , Georgie Porgie . PORGIE You 're not mad at me for going blind this way , are you ? BRICK No. p. 81 PORGIE I 'll be waiting for you . ( BRICK looks around the room , smiling pathetically . He begins to walk to the door , falls silently to one knee , clutches his belly , and tries not to cry out with pain . GEORGIE turns ) Brick ? BRICK Yeah . PORGIE You all right ? BRICK Yeah , sure . PORGIE You want me to go with you ? BRICK No , I 'm all right.BRICK draws himself to his feet , clutching the handle of the door . He slides the door open , steps out , slides the door shut , stands outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in agony , and then disappears . There is a long pause . PORGIE ( Softly ) Buster ? ( Pause . Louder ) Buster ? BUSTER ( Turning ) Yes ? PORGIE You 've been crying , have n't you ? BUSTER Yes , I 'm afraid I have . PORGIE Everybody does when they first get here . When they first realize how foolishly a life can end . BUSTER I miss my son . PORGIE You 're lucky to have a son . p. 82 BUSTER ( Moving to table ) If I could just see him once more , that 's all I 'd want , and I could die in peace . PORGIE When did you see him last ? BUSTER ( Slowly ) Two years ago , when he was almost five . His mother left me then . I ca n't say I blame her , either . I married late in life , and I 've always been a little ridiculous . I used to be at the Bank of America , Sunset Branch . I guess I liked my wife all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever loved is my son . My wife used to go out with people her own age . I did n't mind , though . I did n't mind when she stayed out all night , even , because I was with my son . My son and I had almost five years together . When my wife left , she was going to have another baby . ( Pause ) I mean I knew it was n't mine . I asked her to stay anyway , but I guess she was pretty sick and tired of the sight of me . She must have been to scream at me the way she did . ( Softly ) She said my son was n't my son . Oh , I know she said it because she hated me so , but I wish she had n't said it . Last year she married a fellow who works in a bar on Ortega Street , but I left my job soon after she went off with my son to live with him . I was fired , I mean . ( Pause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and examines them oddly ) I was just no good any more . I 'd known for years something was the matter with me but I had n't done anything about finding out what . I guess I was afraid to find out . When my son was born I did n't care what it was . I had him and that 's all I wanted , so I let it go some more . I let it go until my wife left me , and then I found out . That 's when they fired me . I was glad they did . I wrote to my wife and asked her to please let me see my son , but she never answered my letters , so one night I went to the bar on Ortega Street to talk to her . She made fun of me in front of everybody . And the man she 's married to now put me out . She was n't married to him then , though . ( Pause ) He lifted me by the seat of my pants and put me out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . First , I walked all the way to town because I was too ashamed to get on a streetcar . Then I took a bus to Reno because there was a bus going there when I got to the bus station , but when I got to Reno I decided to keep going . I 'd always wanted to get to New York . When I ran out of money in New York , I got a job in a department store , but I was too old and tired to work , so I did n't last very long . I held my first job twenty-seven years , so you can see how tired I was . I started traveling by bus again , and finally , last week , I got back to San Francisco . I tried to see my son , but I guess I did n't try hard enough . p. 83 PORGIE Why not ? BUSTER I do n't know . I guess I was afraid . I guess I was afraid of my wife . I guess I was afraid of the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ softly ) I guess I was afraid my son would n't remember me , too . PORGIE Yeah . BUSTER I spent a whole afternoon near the house , hoping to see her come out of the house with my son , but she did n't , so then I went to a drugstore and telephoned the house and my son answered . ( Pause ) At first I could n't talk , I was so excited , but after a moment I said , " This is your father . " ( Pause ) " Who ? " my son said , and then a man got on , so I hung up . PORGIE Why have you come here ? BUSTER I was brought here . I 'm broke and , as you know , very sick . PORGIE Do you have a lot of pain ? BUSTER Quite a lot . I 've had quite a lot for a long time now , but not as much as I 've had since I got back to town . PORGIE If you had some money , what would you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Right now . BUSTER I 'd go back and see my son . p. 84 PORGIE Yeah . Sure . So would I. Why does he call you Buster ? BUSTER That 's what I used to call him . We used to pretend we were the same person , so he used to call me Buster , too . I 've always felt we were the same person . PORGIE Yeah . BUSTER But when I said , " This is your father , " all he said was , " ' Who ? " ( Pause ) Who ? I ca n't believe he 's forgotten me . PORGIE Why do n't you forget him ? He 's all right . He 's alive . BUSTER I ca n't forget him . How can a father forget his son ? If I could hold him in my arms once more , I 'd feel I was n't going on alone . I 'm too alone . This is no way to go . If I knew he loved me , I would n't feel I was dying at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no way at all . I hate being here . I hate being here . I believe I hate everybody in this world but my son . PORGIE Feeling the way you do , you might scare him . BUSTER Yes , I know , but I ca n't help wanting to hold him in my arms once more , so I can die in peace . PORGIE You better forget him . No use scaring the only person in the world you love . p. 85 BUSTER He 's got to love me , too , the way he used to love me , so I can stop being so alone , and so afraid to go . He 's my son . He 's got to love me . PORGIE Maybe he ca n't do that any more . Maybe he loves the man your wife 's married to now . BUSTER ( Quietly ) Then , I 'll kill that man . PORGIE You know you would n't do that . BUSTER ( Softly ) I know I would . PORGIE How ? BUSTER ( Bringing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Pause ) I bought it from a man on a bus . He was broke , but all I could spare was three dollars . I told him to keep the gun , but he said he was afraid to keep it . PORGIE Gun ? Are you sure it works ? BUSTER I fired one shell . It works all right . I wanted to be sure it works because on the way back to San Francisco I decided to  --  Well , I thought I 'd take a room and see my son every day until I knew I was finished anyway , and then go out to the ocean and use this . ( Long pause . ) PORGIE You 've still got your clothes on . You 've still got time . p. 86 BUSTER ( Looking at a button in his hand ) I have n't got any more money . PORGIE ( Bringing out some currency from the inside pocket of his robe ) Here 's a little . It 's enough for food and a room at a hotel somewhere for six or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My name 's Harry West in case we do n't see each other again . I did n't expect anybody to be so kind . I wish there was something I could do for you . ( He searches through his pockets ) I 've got two snapshots of my son . I 'd like to leave one of them with you . ( He looks at one of the pictures , then puts it in front of GEORGIE ) Well , I 'll be going now . Thanks very much . PORGIE I hope your son remembers you.BUSTER goes out . GEORGIE picks up the snapshot and tries to make out what 's on it , but obviously fails to do so . He goes to the door and stands there , looking into the ward and listening . Then he wanders to the piano and touches several keys , one at a time . Then he goes back to his chair , obviously almost blind now . He is looking at the picture when POSEYO comes in . PORGIE Is that you , Brick ? POSEYO Brick very sick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to GEORGIE ) You want candy ? p. 87 PORGIE Thanks . ( He reaches out , finds the chocolate bar , tears off the paper , and puts almost half the bar into his mouth ) I ca n't see any more , Poseyo . POSEYO That 's all right . I help you . PORGIE ( Softly ) What 's the matter with Brick ? POSEYO He cut his hand with razor in toilet . Nurse take him away on wagon . PORGIE Ah , for God 's sake ! ( Pause ) What 's the matter with Greedy Reed ? POSEYO He crying . PORGIE Crying ? POSEYO He crying because Andy Boy die . ( Softly ) You want more candy ? He hands GEORGIE PORGIE another candy bar which GEORGIE unwraps and begins to stuff into his mouth . PORGIE I tried my best to keep Brick going , Poseyo . He promised to hang on . He promised to help me . POSEYO I help you , Georgie Porgie . PORGIE Thanks . Thanks a lot . ( Pause ) Listen , Poseyo . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) What 's on this picture ? p. 88 POSEYO ( Looking at picture ) Boy . PORGIE What kind of boy ? POSEYO Small boy . PORGIE What do you think of him ? POSEYO Nice boy . PORGIE If he was your son , Poseyo , and you loved him , what would you do if he did n't love you ? POSEYO ( After thoughtful pause ) Nothing . What I can do ? PORGIE If he was the only person in the whole world you ever loved and he loved you almost five years , and then his mother told you he was n't your son , what would you do ? POSEYO ( After pause ) Nothing . PORGIE If she took him away from you , what would you do ? POSEYO ( Swifter ) Nothing . PORGIE If you wanted to hold him in your arms once more , and the man your wife went off with would n't let you , would you kill that man ? POSEYO No . PORGIE Why not ? POSEYO I do n't know . p. 89 PORGIE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? POSEYO ( Sliding door open ) What 's matter ? PORGIE Put a record on the phonograph and make it loud . POSEYO Everybody sleeping . PORGIE Greedy Reed ai n't sleeping . He 's crying , and I do n't want him to cry . A little loud music will bring him out here , and I 'll straighten him out . ( POSEYO puts a record on the machine : it 's the Mazurka of Khatchaturian 's Masquerade Suite ) Yeah . That 's good.They listen to the music . After a moment GREEDY comes in , sliding the door behind him . He moves to the phonograph graph helplessly , sits on a folding chair and listens in despair until the record ends . He shuts off the machine , goes to the table on which the dictionary rests . REED ( Softly , almost to himself ) Who close the dictionary ? PORGIE Brick , when he heard about Andy Boy . REED Who tell him close the dictionary ? Cut hisself ? PORGIE Nobody told him . REED What right he got close the dictionary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was doing . REED He lose the place . We was up to abdomen . ( Suddenly ) God damn my black luck ! ( The NIGHT NURSE , a heavy woman of fifty or so , obviously upset but trying to control herself , comes in ) Nurse , where 's Andy Boy ? NIGHT NURSE What in the world are you talking about ? REED He was here this morning . Where is he now ? PORGIE What 's happened to Brick ? Is he all right ? NIGHT NURSE Just a moment please , both of you ! ( Looking at chart ) Harry West , the new patient . Day Nurse said I 'd find him in the Sun Room . PORGIE He 's gone to change his clothes . NIGHT NURSE Please let me know the minute he comes back . PORGIE Sure . ( Slight pause ) Is Brick all right ? Is he going to be all right ? ( Pause . ) NIGHT NURSE I 'm afraid not . ( Slight pause ) He must have been in terrible pain to do what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guts to pieces . p. 91 NIGHT NURSE He should have come to me about it . He should n't have waited until the pain was unbearable . PORGIE What could you do for him ? NIGHT NURSE Doctor Bohan might have been able to help him . PORGIE Brick was here three weeks . Doctor Bohan had plenty of time to help him . Why did n't he ? NIGHT NURSE Oh , stop it ! You need n't be sarcastic about Doctor Bohan . He ca n't do the impossible , he ca n't work miracles , but he can give any man at least a little temporary relief from pain . PORGIE Temporary ? He gave Andy Boy permanent relief . NIGHT NURSE Just a minute ! I suppose it 's perfectly natural for all of you to be ungrateful , but if you do n't mind I 'd rather you kept your feelings to yourselves . If you do n't know how lucky you are to have Doctor Bohan looking after you , I do , and I 'd rather not hear you speak of him as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , we 're lucky to have him looking after us all right , but not as lucky as he is to have us to fool around with . Jasper yesterday . Andy Boy today . Greedy Reed tomorrow . REED Greedy Reed tomorrow ? Nobody going to fool around with Greedy Reed tomorrow . p. 92 PORGIE Or Poseyo , or myself , or somebody else in the ward . REED Nobody going to fool around with Greedy Reed the day after tomorrow , either . NIGHT NURSE Oh , stop it , please ! REED Just because Greedy Reed black , do n't mean Doctor Bohan going to fool around with him . Nobody going to fool around with Greedy Reed . NIGHT NURSE Oh , stop it , I say ! ( Slight pause ) I wish you 'd try to be a little helpful , Georgie Porgie . PORGIE I do try . I kept Brick alive three weeks . I tried to get him over his pain tonight , too , but  --  ( He falls silent ) NIGHT NURSE ( Softly ) You should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) When the new patient comes back , please let me know . ( She goes . ) There is a long lonely pause . REED ( Softly ) You still willing to read the dictionary , Georgie Porgie ? You still willing , like you was a little while ago ? PORGIE I 'm still willing . REED ( Lifting the dictionary and setting it down in front of GEORGIE ) Ah , thanks , Georgie Porgie . We was up to abdomen . Now , what is the next word , and what do it mean ? p. 93 PORGIE ( Opening dictionary , trying hard to read ) Well , the next word is  --  ( He rubs his good eye and tries again ) The next word  --  is  --  REED What 's the matter , Georgie Porgie ? PORGIE I 'm willing enough , but I guess I just ca n't see any more . REED Ah , no , Georgie Porgie . Try again , now . Look real hard . What is the word after abdomen ? PORGIE Abide . REED No fooling ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ REED Yeah , that 's right . What else do it mean ? PORGIE To hang around and hang around , and then hang around some more . REED Is that what the book say ? PORGIE That 's what I say . I ca n't read the book . I ca n't see to read it . I ca n't even see faces any more . Everybody is a shadow to me now . REED ( Desperately ) God damn my black luck ! Somebody got to read the dictionary , Georgie Porgie . Poseyo , read the word after abdomen ! POSEYO I no can read . p. 94 REED Sure you can , Poseyo . POSEYO Only Greek . REED Where 's the new patient , Georgie Porgie ? He can read . Where is he ? PORGIE I do n't know . REED I go find him , bring him here . New patient read the dictionary . ( He goes . There is a pause . GEORGIE laughs softly . ) POSEYO ( Softly ) I help you , Georgie Porgie . PORGIE Thanks , Poseyo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Jasper die . PORGIE Yeah . He was a lot of fun with his sarcasm and wise cracks . POSEYO I feel bad when Andy Boy die . PORGIE Yeah . It was good seeing a quiet man like that every morning . A man out of China . POSEYO I feel bad when Brick  --  PORGIE Yeah . Brick was good company . ( Pause . ) POSEYO Greedy Reed tell me this morning you say I hate everybody . PORGIE Everybody hates everybody , Poseyo . I only said that to make Greedy Reed get out of bed and stay alive . If I said you loved everybody that would be true , too , but it would n't make Greedy Reed get out of bed . Everybody does love everybody . Why not ? But staying alive 's a fight and the fight always seems to stop when hate stops . I said you hate everybody because I knew you 'd understand . You 're an older man and you 've been here longer than the rest of us . Greedy Reed needs medicine no hospital 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you ? p. 95 POSEYO ( Softly ) I understand . ( Slight pause ) Man is funny man . More he hate more he help , more he love more he hurt Then who can help who ? Father help his boy ? Husband his wife ? Mother her girl ? Brother brother ? Friend friend ? No . Nobody help nobody . Because man is man . Man is great foolishness . Man is important joke . Oh yes , I feel bad when Jasper die , but I no tell lie , Georgie Porgie , I feel good , too . I feel glad . ( Slight pause ) You understand , Georgie Porgie ? PORGIE I understand , Poseyo .

REED ( Almost sobbing ) Somebody got to read the dictionary , Georgie Porgie . We was up to abdomen when the Doctors come and take Andy Boy away . We was going strong when they take him away and kill him . PORGIE ( Softly ) The Doctors did n't kill him . REED What they do , then ? PORGIE They tried to make him more comfortable . REED The Doctors know Andy Boy ai n't got no chance . Why they fool him that way ? PORGIE ( Softly ) Poseyo did n't tell Andy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shut , the way any real friend would do .

PORGIE I know you meant well , but you could have kept your mouth shut just the same , just in case they did n't know what they were doing . Doctors do n't know very much more than anybody else , you know . REED I did n't know , Georgie Porgie . I believe Doctors know everything .

I feel so good I get down on my knees and pray and I feel sure God going to answer my prayer , but He do n't answer it , Georgie Porgie . He let Andy Boy go . Why ? Because Greedy Reed black ? Because Andy Boy Chinese ? I do n't ask for much . I only ask for one comfortable month for my friend , so we can read the dictionary . Why God refuse me just when I getting a little education ? Just when I beginning to like this life ? Just when I beginning to laugh at my poor color because I know skin color do n't mean nothing ?

What are you mad at me for ? POSEYO I not mad . ( Slight pause ) You know death ? MOPPER No , Poseyo . POSEYO Death and Poseyo fight very hard last night . You know new patient ? MOPPER What new patient ? POSEYO In Andy Boy 's bed . MOPPER Yeah ? What about him ? POSEYO Come here last night , go away , come back three o'clock in morning , very sick . Nurse shake him , shake him , make him cry , give him medicine so he sleep . You know this music ? p. 102 MOPPER Yeah , sure , Poseyo . POSEYO I find this music when I come here three months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why do you do that , Poseyo ? POSEYO Every morning this music cry . I listen , but I do n't know why this music cry .

POSEYO You know what everybody want to be ? MOPPER ( Pause , slowly ) Yes , I do . POSEYO What they want to be ? MOPPER ( Pause , thinking ) Warm . Warm and soft and covered up . They do n't want eyes . They do n't want hands and feet . They want to be warm and small and round . That 's why everybody 's always mad at everybody . Always giving everybody dirty looks . ( He mops to the door , slides it open , pushes the mop beyond the door , turns to POSEYO ) It 's not my fault.He goes out , sliding the door behind him . The music is heard clearly now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open and looks in. p. 103 DAY NURSE Poseyo ! You have n't touched your breakfast ! POSEYO I drink orange . DAY NURSE ( Comes in , leaving door open ) It 's not enough to drink your orange juice . Now , you come right back to your bed and eat everything on your tray . ( POSEYO just looks at her ) Oh , Poseyo ! POSEYO What 's matter ? DAY NURSE ( Trying to straighten herself out ) You must try to eat , Poseyo . You mus n't sacrifice your breakfast every morning for a few minutes of privacy out here . You 've lost too much weight . Doctor Bohan spoke to me about it yesterday . POSEYO Oh ? DAY NURSE Yes , Poseyo . POSEYO Doctor Bohan want me to be fat ? DAY NURSE No , of course he does n't want you to be fat , but he does n't want you to lose any more weight , either . POSEYO Why ? DAY NURSE Oh , Poseyo , you must eat , that 's all . POSEYO I eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . DAY NURSE You do n't eat half enough . ( Slight pause ) Why do n't you eat , Poseyo ? p. 104 POSEYO I not hungry.BUSTER , wearing hospital clothing , comes in . He is in a daze . DAY NURSE looks at him bitterly , then turns back to POSEYO . DAY NURSE Remember , Poseyo , in this life we must think of others , not ourselves alone . Sometimes in this life we must do things because they make others happy . BUSTER ( Softly , bewildered ) What ? DAY NURSE I 'm not talking to you . I 'm talking to Poseyo ! You just behave yourself from now on . ( She turns to POSEYO again while BUSTER watches ) Do n't you see , Poseyo , when you do n't eat , I 'm not happy . POSEYO Oh ? DAY NURSE Yes , Poseyo , and the reason I 'm not happy is that when you do n't eat Doctor Bohan 's not happy . He 's learned a great deal from you , Poseyo . In this life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't like this life . DAY NURSE Oh , Poseyo , I wish you 'd stop talking nonsense . You must try not to be so selfish . POSEYO You want me to eat breakfast ? DAY NURSE Indeed I do  --  because I want you to keep yourself alive as long as possible . The longer you stay alive the happier you make Doctor Bohan , and the happier he is the happier I am . Doctor Bohan would be brokenhearted if you were to leave us , too . p. 105 POSEYO Why ? DAY NURSE Poseyo , do n't you see Doctor Bohan finds out new things from every patient in this ward . I wish you only knew how much you 've helped him already . The more he learns , the more he 's able to help others . Now , how can you stay alive if you do n't eat ? POSEYO Maybe if I eat , I lose no weight but die very quick . Doctor Bohan , he think about that ? DAY NURSE ( Startled ) Poseyo , do you mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer ? POSEYO I do n't know . DAY NURSE You 've been here longer than anyone else , Poseyo . Do you think it 's because you eat so little ? POSEYO I do n't know . ( Slight pause ) You want me to eat breakfast ? DAY NURSE Are you pulling my leg , Poseyo ? POSEYO What means that ? DAY NURSE Are you making fun of me ? POSEYO I do n't know . If you want me to eat breakfast , I eat breakfast . DAY NURSE Well , under the circumstances , perhaps you 'd better not . Perhaps I 'd better report to Doctor Bohan first and find out what he thinks . ( She turns to BUSTER , who is standing at the window . She speaks bitterly ) As for you , young man , you behave yourself from now on , do you hear ? You had the whole hospital in an uproar last night . You can thank God we took you back . This is not a gentlemen 's club , you know , that you can come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take care of very sick men , and you 're a very sick man . I 'm not sure you ought to be out of bed , even , so behave yourself until Doctor Bohan makes his morning rounds and tells me what to do with you . ( She turns back to POSEYO and speaks softly ) He 's very sick , Poseyo . Please look after him.She steps out and slides the door behind her . POSEYO goes to BUSTER. p. 106 POSEYO You come sit down in big chair . BUSTER ( Turns ) What ? He half collapses . POSEYO catches him and gets him into the big red leather chair . POSEYO What 's matter ? BUSTER ( Very softly ) I want to go home . POSEYO You rest in big chair . Listen to music . BUSTER tries to speak , begins to weep softly , then covers his face with his hands . GREEDY comes in , sliding the door behind him . He looks at BUSTER a moment , then turns to POSEYO . REED ( Softly , pointing ) Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ POSEYO turns off the phonograph . ) REED ( Standing over BUSTER ) Why you crying ? BUSTER ( Taking his hands away from his face ) What ? ( He stares at GREEDY a moment , then hides his face again . ) REED No use crying , man . No use hiding your face . They kill Andy Boy , but you do n't see me crying . BUSTER ( Taking his hands away from his face again ) What ? p. 107 REED They kill Andy Boy . BUSTER Who ? REED Andy Boy , man . Andy Boy . He was reading that dictionary right there , and they take him away and kill him . BUSTER Who killed him ? REED I know who . Georgie Porgie tell me all about him last night . BUSTER Georgie Porgie ?

BUSTER ( Dazed , stunned ) I want to go home . REED What 's the matter with you , man ? You ca n't go home no more . No use being scared about it , though . We all in the same boat here . We all at the end of the line . We all tagged . We all homeless and homesick , the same as you . Today or tomorrow or the next day , we all got to go , ignorant and all alone , but nobody going to push me . If there 's going to be any pushing around here , I going to do it !

He kill Andy Boy . You know , Poseyo , I ai n't scared of this dying business no more , because I got my man to get even on now . Nobody going to cheat me out of my revenge now . Today or tomorrow or the next day , I going to kill the man who kill . BUSTER No ! You ca n't do that ! It 's not right . REED What you know about right ? BUSTER It 's not right to kill ! REED Tell that to the man who kill Andy Boy . Tell that to the man who young and strong and healthy and kill the sick and dying . Tell that to the man who cheat my friend out of three months of life . Cheat me out of the first right thing I ever find to do . Tell that to the man who kill , and get up in the morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big breakfast . Tell that to the happy man . BUSTER No ! It 's not right to kill ! REED At last I got my man , Poseyo . I got him and I ai n't going to let him go . I find him at the end of the line , but it 's going to be the end of the line for him , too . ( To BUSTER ) Oh , I ai n't saying it ai n't better to be nice when you 're going to die . I ai n't saying it ai n't better to forgive . I ai n't saying it ai n't better to love . I ai n't saying it ai n't better to lie down and die all alone and be glad it 's only you . I ai n't saying it ai n't better to die nice that way .

Tell me who the man is . Tell me , so I can warn him . REED Oh no ! Nobody going to cheat me out of my revenge . BUSTER Revenge for what ? REED Never mind ! I know for what ! I know ! BUSTER No ! Let me help you . Tell me who the man is . I must warn him , for your sake ! REED Never mind , never mind ! You just sit down again . You got something to hide your face about and cry . You just sit down and hide your face and cry . BUSTER ( To POSEYO ) Who is the man ? You must tell me . ( To GREEDY ) For his sake , you must tell me . Who is the man ? GEORGIE comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he speaks . REED Poseyo do n't know who the man is . BUSTER I do n't believe you . ( To POSEYO ) I want to help this man . I have no right to sit by and let him kill another man . You have no right to do that . Tell me who it is he plans to kill . Tell me , for God 's sake ! PORGIE Is that you , Buster ? p. 110 BUSTER ( Is stunned ) Buster ? My name is Harry West . PORGIE ( He sits at a table and picks up a comic book ) I know . You told me last night . BUSTER ( Almost stammering ) Last night ? ( Quickly ) This man is planning to kill someone , and I want to help him . I have no right not to help him . PORGIE Did you see your son , Buster ? BUSTER ( Stunned ) What ? PORGIE Your son , Buster . ( He brings the picture of BUSTER 'S son out of his pocket ) This boy . Did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes the picture out of his hand , and looks at it a long time . He then sits down in the big leather chair and hides his face in his hands ) Oh , do n't be ashamed , Buster . I knew you would n't . Why should you ? Why should you scare the only person in the world you 've ever loved ? An innocent child who could never be blamed for forgetting someone he has n't seen in two years ? Why should you hate the poor boy 's mother ? Somebody 's got to be everybody 's mother . Why should you hate the man she left you for ? You never loved her anyway , and even if you had , she never loved you . Sure you wanted to hold your son in your arms again . Everybody wants to do a lot of things they ca n't do any more . It 's no disgrace to know you can never get back anything you ever let go . It 's the only thing that gives people the little dignity they have . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave you the money and told you to go because I wanted you to find out for yourself that the son you love is no more . I wanted you to let him be , whoever he is . I wanted you to find out for yourself that your love is the only thing you have by which to die in peace  --  the only thing , Buster  --  your love for a child who takes you for an ugly stranger . Now , I 'm glad you 're back , safe and sound . It 's all right , Buster . It 's all right to cry . You 're among friends . p. 111 BUSTER ( Excited , whispering to GREEDY ) Listen ! Listen to me , before it 's too late ! Do not scheme to take the life of another . Lie down like a man and die in peace , hating no one . If you want to do the right thing , do nothing ! Nothing ! Love nothing ! Hate nothing ! Be nothing ! Lie down , lie down and forget you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Anything else is wrong . REED ( Earnestly ) What he talking about , Georgie Porgie ? ( Softly ) He break my heart . ( BUSTER hides his face in his hands ) There you go hiding your face again ! If you want to help me , like you say , why you hide your face and cry ? You break my heart , man . BUSTER ( Stands ) I want to go home . ( He looks around desperately ) I want to lie down in my own bed in my own house and forget I ever lived . ( He goes . ) REED ( Deeply touched ) That man break my heart , Georgie Porgie . I never see a man like that . Why he hide his face and cry ? PORGIE How would you feel if the only person in the world you love does n't love you ? How would you feel if your own son does n't even remember you ? How would you feel if your wife told you your son ai n't your son ? p. 112 REED @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cry ? PORGIE How would you feel if the man your wife went off with made a fool out of you in public because you wanted him to let you see your son ? How would you feel if you were sick and small and old , the way Buster is , and the man was healthy and strong and young , and picked you up by the seat of your pants in front of your wife and a lot of other people and bounced you out of a cheap saloon ? How would you feel if you did n't have the courage to stand up to people who were stealing your son 's love away from you ? You 'd want to hide your face and cry , too , would n't you ? You 'd want to crawl into your bed and forget you ever lived , too , would n't you ? REED Oh man ! I do n't know what I do . If all that stuff happen to me , I go crazy , I guess . Buster do the right thing all right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know I would n't do the right thing . I guess I go crazy and kill that man . I kill that dirty man ! PORGIE No , you would n't . You 'd just feel bad , stay alive a little longer , and then die , the way everybody else does , the way Buster 's doing now . I know . REED How you know , Georgie Porgie ? PORGIE Buster did n't want to be here last night . He wanted to go home . He wanted to see his son . He had a pistol he 'd bought from somebody on a bus , and he said he 'd kill anybody who tried to keep him away from his son , only he did n't have any more money , so I gave him all the money I had . I wanted him to get out of here . I wanted him to see his son . But most of all I wanted him to kill the man who took his son and his wife away from him , and put him here to die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his own bed , with his son in the house to listen to and see and smell and hold in his arms . He 's a little man , but I thought maybe he 'd do it . I thought maybe he 'd have guts enough to fight back against the strong , but he did n't . He came back . He did n't do it because human beings ca n't hate . I always thought they could , but they ca n't . They ca n't love , either . ( He stops. ) p. 113 REED What can they do , Georgie Porgie ? PORGIE ( Softly ) Breathe . REED Is that all ? PORGIE That 's all . But even that 's done for them , the same as it 's done for all animals . Human beings might as well be sheep . And now , I 'm tired of being one of them . I ca n't even pretend to hate any more . When Doctor Bohan makes his rounds this morning I 'm going to ask him to do something about my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ! PORGIE Oh , I know he ca n't help me , but I 'm finished and I know it , so there 's no use kidding any more . REED No , Georgie Porgie , you got a lot of time . We ai n't finished yet . PORGIE You may not be finished yet because you can still pretend , but I ca n't . I ca n't pretend anything any more . REED What you mean , Georgie Porgie ? PORGIE You can still pretend you want to hear somebody read the dictionary . You can still pretend hearing the words means something to you . You can still pretend there 's a good way to spend the rest of your life . You can still pretend there 's something you can do that will give your life some kind of meaning . You can still pretend you hate . You can still pretend you 're yourself , a whole man , and not a small part of the incurable disease all men are . Our disease is just one of the many names for it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a small part of it and nothing else . Now , all I want to do is give my head back , and everything else . God help us in our naked and blind loneliness . p. 114 REED I do n't know what you saying , Georgie Porgie , but do n't go put yourself in the hands of Doctor Bohan and leave me all alone . If it 's pretending you need to stay a little longer , pretend something , Georgie Porgie . Pretend something ! PORGIE My head 's on fire . My eyes are blind . I ca n't pretend any more . REED Ah , sure you can , Georgie Porgie . Do n't go leave me now when I need you so bad . Pretend , and stay a little longer . Stay and keep me company . Pretend we ai n't dying at all , Georgie Porgie . Pretend we 're getting ready to get born . PORGIE I ca n't , I ca n't . I wish to God I could , but I ca n't . REED Pretend we ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're on our way to something nice , like that time you dreamed about yesterday . Pretend we 're on our way to sunshine and nothing to do but enjoy ourselves . Pretend things like that , Georgie Porgie , and keep me just a little more company . PORGIE I 'm sorry . I ca n't pretend anything any more . REED Then , tell me what to do , Georgie Porgie . I ca n't fight my ignorance alone . ( He lifts up the dictionary ) The words , Georgie Porgie ! They 're the only thing can save me . ( His voice cracks with sobbing as he goes on ) Education ! That 's my only hope . I do n't want to be ignorant no more . I do n't want to hate no more . I do n't want to kill no more . Pretend something , Georgie Porgie , keep me just a little more company , teach me the way to fight my ignorance . p. 115 MOPPER ( Comes in with some newspapers and magazines ) Here 's the new American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? PORGIE What 's the headline , Mopper ? MOPPER ( Opening paper , reading headline ) Man Shot in Street . PORGIE What street ? Market ? MOPPER ( Examining paper ) No . Ortega . PORGIE Ortega ? Are you sure , Mopper ? MOPPER Sure I 'm sure . Ortega Street is what it says right here . PORGIE Who killed who ? MOPPER Somebody killed a bartender named James Valenti . PORGIE Who did it ? MOPPER Nobody knows . Nobody saw it happen . Bartender was walking home after work at two o'clock in the morning . Somebody shot him , that 's all . Was n't robbery , though . Bartender 's wallet was in his coat pocket . PORGIE ( Swiftly ) Any pictures ? MOPPER Pictures on page twelve , it says .

And here 's a picture of the four of them together on a picnic in Golden Gate Park . Husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PORGIE Any other pictures ? MOPPER No , just those three .

MOPPER ( Putting the bundle in front of GEORGIE ) Whoever it was killed the bartender must have had a good reason . Nobody goes to all that trouble for nothing . ( He goes to the door . ) PORGIE How are things in the ward , Mopper ? MOPPER Everything seems to be under control again , I guess . The man in bed nine died last night . Nurse asked me to help her get him on the wagon , and she took him away . PORGIE Who was in bed nine , Poseyo ? POSEYO Man who come here six seven days ago . Sleep all the time . PORGIE Oh yes . Larson , the seaman . Thanks for bringing the paper and magazines , Mopper .

POSEYO Young , strong . PORGIE And the woman ? POSEYO Strong . PORGIE Do you think she loved the bartender ? POSEYO Maybe . PORGIE Do you think she loved him enough to help the police ? POSEYO What for ? Strong woman . Good-looking . What for ? He 's dead . PORGIE Maybe she 's glad he 's dead . POSEYO Maybe . PORGIE ( His voice powerful again ) She wo n't help the police . ( Pause ) And neither will we . Will we , Poseyo ? POSEYO What for ? PORGIE Greedy Reed ? We wo n't help them , will we ? REED What you talking about , Georgie Porgie ? PORGIE Buster can read , you know . He can read the dictionary . p. 118 REED Buster ? That little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not . Buster 's the man who come here to read the dictionary . We do n't know who killed the bartender . The police do n't know . The bartender 's wife does n't know . Buster does n't know . All we know is that Buster 's here ! REED ( Alive and hopeful again , going to GEORGIE 'S table ) Let me see that bartender ! ( He looks ) Hot dog ! Well , what do you know ? A man about thirty-three years old . Handsome , too . Strong and proud . Well , I live longer than the bartender , anyway .
