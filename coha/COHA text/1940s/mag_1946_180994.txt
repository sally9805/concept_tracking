Paris , traditionally the place where the talented young wild men go , is actually an old man 's paradise . Last week art lovers crowded the swank Galerie Charpentier in Faubourg Saint-Honore , to see 100 topflight examples of the contemporary " Paris School . " Of the 52 painters in the show , about a dozen were dead . The average age of the living : 65 . <P> The show displayed the rich harvest of an era whose beginnings had not yet been recognized or accepted by a good many Americans . Among the radical grandfathers of modern art : <P> Matisse ( 76 ) , whose freewheeling , almost religiously joyful art is broader and bolder than ever , now does most of his drawing in bed . <P> Picasso ( 64 ) , who sometimes changes his style when he changes women , recently shifted his affections to a new girl friend . He has had no new " period " since the broken teeth , swollen hands and multiplying eyes of his Spanish War mural , Guernica . <P> Rouault ( 75 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blazing Byzantine Christs with noses like thumbs , and painfully contorted acrobats , has come to look like a wistful old clown or a humorous old priest . He keeps to himself in Paris , suing his enemies for old debts and avoiding his friends . <P> Four of the painters in the show , Derain ( 66 ) , Van Dongen ( 67 ) , Segonzac ( 63 ) , and Vlaminck ( 70 ) , had been suspended from public showing for the past year ( because they exhibited in Berlin during the war ) . Now their year of quiet humiliation was up , and the weary old foursome could creep into the daylight once again .
