Alexandria was busy last week , but not frightened . In the hotels along the placid , sweeping arc of waterfront , civil servants gathered to talk , listen to radio reports , and read the Reuters ticker . In canteens back in the town , soldiers and sailors waited for orders and talked about this chance to crack the Jerries . The fleet was massed in west harbor behind Ras el Tin Point , and in the harbor there was a bustle of ships oiling , coaling , painting , refitting , storing , watering , signaling back &; forth . Troops poured into town from East Africa , furious that their winter work was canceled . <P> This Alexandria was a focus last week . The German drive , which had swept across Libya as fast and as hot as the desert wind called khamsin , was apparently aimed straight for Alexandria . If it reached there , Britain would lose her main operating base and very likely her whole position in the Eastern Mediterranean . <P> But this did not frighten Alexandrians : they saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a formidable part of the fleet put to sea . <P> It would take at least several days , perhaps a fortnight , for General Sir Archibald Percival Wavell to organize a counteroffensive with the troops which passed through Alexandria from East Africa to the Egyptian Front . But meanwhile the news from scant forces holding the land front was encouraging . The British garrison at Tobruch was not merely besieged , it was fighting back . The Germans seemed to have forgotten that the British still supplied the garrison from the sea . <P> Axis troops , mostly Italian , besieged the town . The defenders nipped attack after attack , and claimed 35 tanks and 1,500 Germans and Italians . Farther east , at the border between Libya and Egypt , the British claimed to be holding the Axis force at and around Halfaya ( " Hell-fire " ) Pass . <P> When the ships left , Alexandrians heard soon enough where they had gone . The Navy announced its greatest success since the Battle of Cape Matapan : in the narrow channel between Sicily and Cape Bon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Libyan attack , a cruiser squadron caught a convoy consisting of two ships laden with motor transport , one ammunition ship , and two ships thought to be carrying troops , all protected by three Italian destroyers . The British swept in , slapped aside the flimsy protection , and sank the whole convoy forthwith . The British lost one destroyer , the 1,870-ton Mohawk , in the operation , but saved most of her crew . <P> The British in Alexandria rested secure in the feeling that this time German logistical arrangements were vulnerable ; that though they had come far , it was still lots farther to Alexandria and Suez ; that the Germans had not had time to adjust themselves to desert dysentery , sand blindness , and the strange desert infection which keeps even scratches open . But from Vichy they heard that the Germans had spent weeks baking themselves in huge , sand-floored , sunlamp-lit ovens at temperatures well over 100 , to fit themselves for desert fighting .                @ @ @ @ @
