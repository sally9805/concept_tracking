The broad , neatly paved streets of Teheran were alive with the uniforms of U.S. , British and Russian soldiers , the rags and splendor of Persians , the sound , sight and smell of Polish refugees , Free Frenchmen , Arabs , Turks , Kurds , Uzbeks , Armenians . Teheran had become more than the capital of corrupt , backward , oil-rich Persia . Teheran was the focal point of a great Allied supply route to Russia , a testing ground for collaboration among the United Nations . <P> At Persia 's southern ports battered freighters unloaded planes , tanks and guns for Russia . Across the arid plains and flinty mountains lines of trucks snaked northward . U.S. and Russian workers sweated in new aircraft assembly plants . Red Army pilots put the finished planes through grueling tests . Aircraft of Britain , Russia and the U.S. kept Teheran 's glittering Ghalemorghi airport humming . <P> Teheran 's best hotel , the Imperial Palace , had been converted into an officers ' billet . Next best was the ramshackle , Government-operated Ferdowsi Hotel , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bar swarmed with U.S. and British officers , drinking V &; V ( vodka &; vermouth ) . Off duty , the Russians kept to themselves in billets and barracks , where they trained when not working and sang when not training . Only once had a Russian turned up in the Ferdowsi 's dining room . He ate alone and never returned . <P> Nominally presiding over this scene is the young ( 23 ) , handsome Shah , Mohammed Reza Pahlavi , who was put on the throne in 1941 by the British when his father , Reza Shah Pahlavi , proved too friendly to the Axis . The Government is run by Prime Minister Ali Soheily , who has apparently served his country and the Allies as well as circumstances permitted . <P> Seven Who Try . Thoroughly embroiled in Persia 's entangled politics and economy are seven U.S. advisers to Ali Soheily . They are there because : 1 ) the better Persia is run , the better the Russian supply route will work ; 2 ) the Allies are anxious to offset Germany 's influence in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest of the East . <P> Last week the seven were deep in trouble . Lent unofficially by the U.S. , they were paid by Persia . But they had no powers ; they could only advise . The seven : <P> - Joseph Sheridan , a retired millionaire and ex-Californian , who for 20 years was Cairo 's leading wholesale grocer , is food adviser to Iran . As such , he is in constant conflict with rich , absentee landowners who hoard wheat , sell it on the black market , and keep the Government from controlling prices . Bread is the Persian 's staple food , and in the past six months he has often had none . Sheridan first bought flour at $150 a ton , sold it to bakeries at $50 to keep bread prices down . Bakers promptly hid half their flour , sold it on the black market at fantastic prices . Then Sheridan started building public bakeries . One is in operation . <P> - Bearded , aging Professor Luther M. Winsor , the agricultural adviser , travels the length &; breadth of arid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the need for irrigation . ( Until Hulaku Khan 's invaders destroyed it almost 700 years ago , Persia had an excellent irrigation system of underground passages and canals. )
