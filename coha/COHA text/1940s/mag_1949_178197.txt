King Leopold III of the Belgians and his beautiful wife were happily packing their bags last week in their lakeside villa at Pregny , Switzerland , where they have been whiling away their long exile . They were in hopeful spirits . General Emile Bethouart , French High Commissioner in Austria , had invited them for a week of hunting in the Tyrol . After that , there was a chance that they might go on to Brussels . A decision on the King 's future was finally at hand . <P> Leopold had just received a visit from Belgian Premier Gaston Eyskens . Together they had worked out an important political agreement . Eyskens would ask Parliament this week to hold a " popular consultation " on whether or not the King should return . If Leopold received less than 55% of the referendum votes , he would abdicate . He did not say what he would do if he got more than 55% . But it was plain that he would need a majority well over 55% before Parliament would actually agree to his return . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his Christian Socialist party instantly renewed Belgium 's dormant political battle over the King 's comeback . Leopold 's supporters had gathered a 25-million franc ( $71,429 ) war chest for the impending political campaign . His chief antagonists , the Socialists , were reviving their " action committees " which are supposed to organize strikes if the King should return . Cried one of the Liberal leaders , Gaston Vandewiele : " Leopold is obstinate and a blockhead . " <P> Ex-Premier Paul-Henri Spaak , now president of the Council of Europe 's Assembly , who had hitherto been mild on the subject of Leopold , called the Leopold-Eyskens agreement " sheer political folly . " If the King got less than 55% of the votes , said Spaak , the institution of the monarchy itself could be endangered . " The King would render the country an immense service , " added Spaak , " if he agreed to abdicate . If this sacrifice is above his strength , the King could say he would return only with wide popular support . . . at least two-thirds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharpened political temper interfered with Leopold 's vacation plans . When Premier Eyskens got word of the proposed Tyrol trip , he snapped to the King 's secretary in Brussels : " Tell His Majesty that he must forget the invitation . Belgian public opinion has a disagreeable remembrance of Leopold 's visits to Austria during the German occupation . " <P> When he reigned , Leopold had a reputation for disregarding his ministers ' counsel . But at week 's end he canceled his hunting junket , instead took his princess to Paris for an " incognito " holiday .
