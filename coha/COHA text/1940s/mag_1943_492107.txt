FROM the rail of the U.S.S. Wright , nine days out or Pearl Harbor , I watched the island of Wake grow slowly more distinct . This was November 29 , 1941 . In ten days , this small section of paradise was destined to look like something dredged up from the depths of hell . The trim white buildings would be smoke-blackened ruins . The green woods would be torn and splintered and the long smooth beach pitted with shell holes and strewn with pieces of shrapnel , But on that sunny morning we had no premonition of trouble . Japan was threatening once more , pointing a gun at the Pacific like an international stick-up man , but such a state of affairs was chronic , and I could n't recall the time when ? apan had n't done just that . Then , too , the suave JET emissaries , Nomura and Kurusu , were in Washington , oozing made-in-Japan peace and loving-kindness from every pore . And for all we knew , they 'd be there hissing politely through their teeth and talking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atoll that is Wake was sealed against the passage of ships by a long series of half-submerged reefs over which heavy ocean swells tumbled and broke incessantly , setting up a deep roar that was never stilled , night or day . Drowning out all minor sounds , that roar was later to shred the nerves of men straining their ears for the first noise of approaching enemy bombers . A boat put out from shore . A smallish man was seated in its stern . He was lean of face , sported a trim little dark mustache and wore the uniform of our Marine Corps . He came nimbly aboard and I shook hands for the first time with Maj. James Patrick Sinnot Devereux , USMC , known more simply to his friends as Jimmy , whose home is in Chevy Chase , Maryland . Major Devercux was in command of the ground forces , Wake detachment , first battalion . With me , and under my command , were forty-seven enlisted men and one officer , 2nd Lt. Robert J. Conderman , of New Bern , North Carolina , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and plentiful freckles . My assignment on Wake Island was to establish facilities at the flying field for air-ground radio communications , and this outfit was to help me do it . As soon as the work was done , I was to proceed immediately to Midway Island and repeat the job there . The work was right up my alley . I 'd taken the course in communication engineering at the Annapolis post-graduate school in 1932 , and the advanced course in the same subject at Harvard a year later . There were no docks on the ocean side of Wake Island at which the ship could discharge her cargo . So lighters came alongside and took us on board . Major Devereux had already set up two rows of pyramid tents near his own encampment to take care of our men and , in addition , had set up a number of wall tents for the officers . There was also a hospital tent which he had assigned to the use of Maj. Paul A. Putnam , of Washington , Iowa . Putnam was expected to arrive shortly with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in command of aviation on Wake . Paul and his planes were eagerly awaited . When I arrived , there was not a plane on the whole atoll . The name " Wake , " I discovered , was just another way of saying swift and competent construction . Pan American Airways had done the preliminary spadework . When that company rolled a speculative eye over the mid-Pacific area in search of a likely site on which to build a station for its big Orient-bound clippers , it had come to rest on Wake . The United States Government had designated the uninhabited island 13 as a bird sanctuary  --  a move intended to soothe the nerves of jittery Japan . Pan Am apologized to the birds and moved in . Selecting tiny Peale Island at the northwestern tip of the U for its base , the company erected an operations station and a hotel for its passengers . That was back in 1935 . After that the development of Wake came to a standstill until early in 1941 , when we decided to strengthen the atoll for defense . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilian construction workers under contract to the Government . The civilian group was under the direction of Dan Teeters , who represented the contractors . Teeters and his men were stationed at Camp 2 , across the lagoon from our marine encampment . Over there , Dan had set up a barbershop , an ice-cream parlor , a general store and an outdoor movie theater . Teeters was well liked by the marines . He was extended the privileges of our officers ' club , such as they were . The club was only a small tent , but it boasted a framework and a wooden deck . Its most attractive features were two ice boxes always kept filled with ice and beer . Wake Island was one of the busiest spots on the map of the Pacific . The prevailing spirit was " get it done quickly . " That spirit was contagious . It caught me up in its drive and inspired me to do likewise or make a good try at it . The main aviation runway was a magnificent stretch of coral 200 feet wide and almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , I built my radio station in a tent . Much to my aatis ) faction , it worked the first time I tested it . I finished my assignment in three days . My ground-to-plane system of communication was in operating order . I was all set , from then on , to talk to one of our planes , if there 'd been one around to talk to , Meanwhile , my second in command , young Conderman , was busy setting up general maintenance facilities for the squadron of fighter planes we expected . After my work was done , I strolled around to see hat I could see , and met a couple of new neighbors not listed on the Marine Corps or civilian-workman roster . One was a queer feathered habitue of the island , called a pirate bird , a type of bird with a villainous face and disposition . Among their unpleasant habits was a fondness for flying around in beautiful close formation , so that from a distance they looked exactly like a squadron of their yellow brother bandits , only without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Wake Island rat , end I 'll have more to say later about these vermin . I forgot about rats , however , when I reached Peacock Point and came suddenly upon a battery of 5-inch naval guns , their snouts pointing seaward . They were so a ' a I 1Y . .. . . cy were invisible Trom apotLiaLatards. . g/ , thezi .... -1 . heir gun mounts were buried , and each piece was surrounded by sandbags painted to blend perfectly with the background . The guns themselves were painted in crazy designs of green and huff and black . Branches of trees had been painstakingly planted in the surrounding coral waste and , to keep the discoloration of dying leaves from giving the whole show away , the leaves themselves had been painted green . The general appearance of the entire locality was that of an innocent thicket . Passing through a belt of woods which paralleled the shore , I came out on the lagoon , where a bunch of marines were swimming as naked as Mother Nature had made them . I watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep-water pool inshore had been fenced off by a net of heavy-mesh wire to protect the bathers from barracuda and sharks . I heard some kidding to the effect that , knowing how our leathernecks were always spoiling for a fight , the thing had been put there to protect the sharks and barracuda from them . It worked very well both ways . .. " A favorite topic of conversation was the expected arrival of MajorEutriam , USMC , with his squadron of planes , the outEt  --  bi.ng officially  --  designated as Marfitron 211 . Putnam was not far away . With twelve Marine Corps figt b .. , re , single-seated Garrutrin F:lralfrhfA  --  C. isivas approaching tre and ida13 .. g , carrier . The ship was Fa  --  bring the Tri  --  es and pilots within easy flying range of Wake , then toss them into the air and let them finish the trip under their own war . In a letter to a friend on the eve of his leaving the ship , Putnam wrote : " He the admiral in command of the task @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plain to me that nothing would be overlooked nor any trouble spared in order that I will get ashore with twelve airplanes in as near perfect condition as possible . I feel a bit like the fatted calf being groomed for whatever it is that happens to fatted calves , but it surely is nice while it lasts , and the airplanes are pretty and sleek too . " The twelve Grumman with Putnam himself , nine commissioned pilots and two enlisted pilots at the controls , came dropping from the sky on Thursday , December fourth . We gave them a reception as royal as our small community could put on . Nothing was lacking but a strip of red carpet . The eleven pilots and Putnam , together with Strawberry Conderman and myself , brought the total of the marine aviation force on Wake Island to sixty-one  --  twelve officers and forty-nine enlisted personnel . For the next few days Marfitron 211 settled down and got ready for whatever might be coming . The busiest man of the lot was Putnam . I put him down in my mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , he was a determined type who looked quite capable of doing the things he had done , and of repeating them with trimmings . As a lieutenant in 19:31 , he had seen flying service on active duty in Nicaragua which earned him the Cross of Valor , the citation crediting him with " extraordinary heroism in airplane flights " and " distinguished service to the Guardia Nacion.ai and to the Republic of Nicaragua . " Our Secretary of the Navy had also written him a letter of commendation , praising his " tact and sound judgment " and his " valuable assistance in the suppression of banditry in Nicaragua . " These facts were of particular interest to me. since I had seen active service myself in Nicaragua in 1928 , when , for eight months . I was a member of the mule-mounted " Horse Marines , " as we called ourselves , patrolling the countryside on the lookout for the bandit-guerrilla leader , Gen. Augustine Sandino . The arrival of Putnam 's Marfitron 211 had nearly been anticlimaxed by the unexpected appearance on December third of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alighted on the lagoon and tied up to buoys there . We were n't told what their mission was , but from their maneuvers it was my guess that they were keeping an eye on the sea lanes to our Hawaiian frontier . Every morning for three days Camp 1 was awakened at the crack of dawn by the roar of motors as six of them took off from the Lagoon , the other half dozen standing by and resting The six in the air would fan out in a southerly direction and be gone all day . The following morning , the second six would take over and be away on their mysterious business . On December sixth these PBY 's departed eastward for Midway . Here , apparently , was my " first available air transportation " to Midway , and I expected to go with them . But their commander shook his head apologetically and vetoed the notion . Each plane was already heavily loaded and carried its full crew , he explained , and no room could possibly be found for a passenger . After that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those iceboxes . Comfortably settled with a bottle of cold beer , I took out the notebook in which I occasionally write to my wife , tearing out the pagris and posting them as opportunity arisen . She and my little ten-year-old daughter were then at the Donna Hotel in Honolulu . I had left them there on November twentieth . I brought her up to date as far as my adventures were concerned , told her my work was finished , but that I was temporarily marooned , and added that there were worse places than Wake Island on which to pass an enforced vacation . " It 's a beautiful spot , " I wrote , " interesting and utterly peaceful . " About seven o'clock the next morning , as I set a leisurely course from my tent , I saw Jimmy Devereux standing on the wooden platform in front of his quarters , staring at a sheet of paper in his hand . He motioned me to join him . " ' Morning . Baylor , " he said , and added in an ordinary conversational tone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jape attacked Pearl Harbor this morning . " My mouth opened . It stayed open , but nothing came out . " Of course it may be just another false alarm , " Devereux went on calmly , " so I have requested verification . If it comes through , I 'll let everyone know immedi ately . " He nodded , turned and went into his quarters . Although it 's not generally known , there had been a number of false alerts at Pearl Harbor before the heavens really opened and rained high explosives on December seventh . Devereux 's casual reminder of those phony alarms acted on me like a shot of plasma on a man threatened with shell shock . If I was thoughtful as I continued on to my tent , it was because of concern for my wife and little daughter . If the news should be true , I wondered how they had fared . The Donna Hotel , after all , was not such a long way from the Pearl Harbor base . The news was no false alarm . In less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his headquarters porch . He told us tersely that Japan had opened hostilities at Pearl Harbor , warned us we must expect to be attacked ourselves at any minute , and ordered us to battle stations . Into those last two words were packed volumes . They meant that each of us must go to his post of duty and put in effect all the defensive measures which had been planned against just this emergency . We scattered to our jobs and got busy . I have been asked many times what my reactions and those of my brother officers were when Jimmy told us the news . Frankly , I do n't believe there were any worthy of note . There was nothing dramatic in the scene on Jimmy 's porch , certainly nothing melodramatic . The human mind works oddly , and for some reason there flashed into mine the picture of the Japanese ambassador at Washington , plump , slant-eyed Nomura , who had been loudly proclaiming Japan 's desire for peace . The big yellow beast was there to put over this fast one , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one truly emotional mo-ment in those early hours of December eighth , it came sharply at eight o'clock , when the clear notes of a bugle sounding " To the Colors " carried to the remotest corner of the island . Two armed marines pulled snappily at a set of halyards , and Old Glory was broken out at the top of the flagpole . The flag went up that morn-ing for keeps . It was never lowered again during my stay on the island . Miracu-lously it was n't hit , but stood out bravely in the trade wind , day after day , above the smoke and ruin left by Tojo 's bombs . My glance went from the flagpole to a lofty structure close by it , a combination observation post and signal tower . r could see the heads and shoulders of the watchmen there , as motionless as statues . They were peering intently through field glasses at the empty southern skies , watching for the first sign of enemy bombers , which might be a pinprick light reflected from polished metal . Paul Putnam was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bombs into the ships ; others were loading the machine guns and filling the long belts with cartridges . Gasoline trucks were racing from on plane to another , fueling tanks to capac-3r- Putnam sent up four of his twelve planes , under the command of Capt . Hank Elrod , from Thomasville , Georgia , to head south and keep an eye open for enemy bombers . The four were soon out of sight , and Paul tackled the job of dispersing the remaining eight grounded planes to widely separated points , so that the whole lot might not be de . troyed by one lucky bomb . The Pan Am Clipper . Manila-bound , had flown in the night before . It had taken off again at dawn , unwittingly flying right into the teeth of the enemy . Fortunately , before it met them it was caught by a radio message from headquarters , which broke the news of Pearl Harboi and directed the clipper to return to Wake Island with all speed . Her pilot , J. H. Hamilton , lost no time in obeying . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the morning was still young . Here was a chance which an opuortunist like Paul . Putnam could hardly miss . He sent for Hamilton , conferred with him , and put an eager question : Would he undertake a long-range reconnaissance flight to the south and report what he found ? Hamilton said he would . Jimmy Devereux had work for him too . The little major had found time in the midst of all his worries to think of the Pan Am personnel on Peale Island . They could not fight , and it did n't seem fair just to let them sit around and he massacred . Besides , Devereux already had 1200 civilian mouths to feed , and though he had plentiful stores of food and reservoirs of fresh water , he did n't want to draw on them unnecessarily . So , would Hamilton take care of evacuating the whole Pan Am contingent ? The pilot agreed to do that too . He hurried back to Peale Island to notify them to get packed and to arrange for his long reconnaieennce flight , For good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Death at Noon Almost lost in the welter of marines and civilians was a small squad of fly or six regular Army enlisted men unde the commend of a Captain Wilson , of the United States Army Signal Corps . Wilson was Stationed on Wake to provide is radio guard for trensient Army bombers shuttling to and fro between Hawaii and the southern areas . He had his radio works operating from a truck and a trailer parked in an out-of-the-way corner of the field , but as soon as he heard the news , he moved his outfit into a patch of thin woods lying between the field and the road which runs along the southwestern coast of the island . His guardian angel must have been very much on the job when he was selecting the new site , for while he was close enough to the bombed area that day to reach out and pat the stuff as it fell , not a thing hit him or his men or their trucks . , Jimmy Devereux was everywhere , keeping an efficient eye on all the prepa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never knew he was around unless you fell over him or he spoke to you . Once or twice I saw a fleeting smile on his face . There , I thought , goes a skilled artilleryman , thinking of what he 'd like to a with his guns . Not that he had many guns to do it with . There were six 5-inch , 51-caliber guns  --  the battery I 'd seen so well camouflaged on Peacock Point  --  twelve 3-inch anti-aircraft guns , eighteen 50-caliber antiaircraft guns , and thirty 30-caliber antiaircraft guns . There were the usual light weapons  --  rifles and pistols  --  and six searchlights . Not an imposing armament , but it did n't seem to upset Devereux 's serenity ; he figured he 'd make it do  --  at leant till reinforcements arrived . Consciously or subconsciously , everybody was listening . That was when we first began to curse the incessant roar of the surf . The harder we listened , the more surf we heard  --  and nothing else . We realized a plane would have to be almost overhead before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As noon drew near and our various tasks were practically completed , a group of us gathered for lunch in the squadron tent an the parking apron that edged this runway . We were lounging under the tent fly , waiting for food , when we heard . even above the roar of the surf , the sound of many engines . We piled out from beneath the fly and looked southward . Twenty-four big planes were coming straight toward us in two Vs of twelve planes each , traveling fast at an altitude of about 3000 feet . " Those must be our B-Seventeens , " said somebody . " B-Seventeens , hell ! " said someone else sharply . " They 're - laps ! " The words catapulted us into movement . We put our heads down and sprinted toward a patch of woods and slight rise of ground . On an Wand with an average altitude of ten feet above sea level , a rise of fifteen feet , like the spot I was racing for , is practically Mount Everest . Just . as I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first v came directly over me . I threw myself flat on the ground at the base of a small tree . Bombs hurtled down upon the edges of the runway . My body was shaken by the explosions , as if I were astride of a bucking earthquake . Vision WAS cut off almost immediately . I was engulfed and half strangled by a choking cloud of dirt , dust and the acrid fumes of exploding bombs . Added to it were intense heat and the smell of burning gasoline from big tanks which had been struck . I heard what sounded like bombs falling at a distance , but I could n't be sure ; they might be close by , and the Mullion of distance might be due to same impairment of my hearing . I did n't suppose , if I lived at all , that my eardrums would ever be normal again . But that detail was cleared up for me by another terrific bombing as close as the first , and I knew my ears were still all right . Twelve-Minute Inferno Later I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up of twelve planes had plastered the airport with its bombe , while the other V had swept on to attack Peale Island and the Pan Am hotel , its station and the big clipper . Then the first crowd had turned and come back to dump a second load of bombs on us . I had glanced at my watch EL moment before we heard the deep droning in the sky ; the attack began precisely at MSS . It was twelve minutes before the Jape drew off southward , headed back to their base . It was a twelve-minute foretaste of hell . Very slowly , the trade wind carried away the worst of the dust and fumes , and it became possible to see something of the airfield . I needed no more than one glimpse of the mesa spread before me to realize how badly we had suffered . Looking at it brought waves of nausea up into my throat . every direction I saw our dead .. There were twenty-three of them . I saw seven wounded ; thei bodies torn , i. ' rtsi s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Seven of our eight precious planes , so carefully dispersed , were burning . Tents were burning or riddled by shrapnel and bullets . The vast parking area was a sea of debris  --  some of it human . A little too far off to hail , I saw Paul Putnam walking about . He gave me the impression of a man walking aimlessly in his sleep . Not far from my slight elevation I recognized two bodies as those of officers who had been with me in the tent , waiting for lunch . Like me , they had headed for this spot , and had been just far enough behind  --  no more than a second or two  --  to catch the full fury of the exploding bombs . Madly anxious to get up and at ' em if he could , an officer who had been with us had made a desperate attempt to reach his plane . He had reached the Grumman and scrambled into the pilot 's seat just as the plane was hit by a bomb . It struck right behind the cockpit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flaming right wing of his ship . I noted these things almost subconsciously as I got shakily to my feet and left the rise for the level field . Not far away , I saw two wounded lieutenants stretched out . They were badly injured , and looked it . From somewhere in space appeared the tall gangling figure of a marine private whose name I never learned . He helped me rip the burlap curtain from a near-by latrine and fashion it into a crude litter , then we went for the two wounded officers and carried them , one after the other , to the side of the low rise . Gently we eased them from the burlap to the ground . The first of the two we moved had been torn from heed to foot by flying shrapnel , and seemed to be in worse shape than his companion . AB we put him on the ground he raised his left leg slightly and said , " Look at that damned foot . " The boxed forward part of his boot had been ripped away , ( Continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the smaller toes of his foot . Lifting the second young officer to slip the burlap beneath him , we saw that both his upper legs had suffered compound fractures . But he was conscious , and spoke to me quite rationally as we stooped over him . " Walt , " he said , " be careful of those legs . " That first tour of the stricken airfield was a heartbreaking experience none of us who made it will ever forget . I saw pretty much the same expression on the face of every man I met . They were shocked by the suddenness of the assault , scarcely able to comprehend the swiftness with which death had snatched away their friends and messmates , but as the truth came slowly home to them they set their jaws grimly and started thinking about the next round of the battle . The squadron tent where our little group had been gathered at 11:58 had taken a direct hit . Those of us who had rushed outside at the sound of engines were the only ones who had had a ghost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cloudbank to the south , the Japs had glided in , unseen by our patrol planess or by the watchmen on the tower and nobody had had more than about five seconds in which to seek shelter . The two young clerks had been in the rear of the tent and farthest away from the exit . The pair were close friends and inseparable companions . They remained inseparable in death , their bodies lying side by side in the splintered debris of the tent . Second Lieutenant Holden , of Tenafly , New Jersey  --  one of the men who had rushed out of the squadron tent at the first alarm  --  was among those killed . We found him stretched on his back on the runway . His legs were crossed , one arm thrown carelessly across his chest , and he looked for all the world like a man who had just lain down , relaxed and gone to sleep . I could look across the lagoon and see columns of smoke rising from the airways station and hotel , and presently I got the details from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hamilton and his personnel had no more warning than ourselves . They had only time to throw themselves flat on the ground and take strafing from bombs and machine guns . ' The Japs swooped down on the clipper and gave it a going-over with machine guns . When Hamilton examined her after the raid , he counted scores of holes through her wings and compartments . However , her motors had escaped , and she was airworthy , so he took her out that afternoon with passengers and crew and headed for Hawaii , more than 2000 miles away . He made it safely , and I 've heard since that he and the clipper crew volunteered to start off again immediately and go anywhere they could be of service . Back at our airfield , eaul .. E.utnes.was grimly taking stock of our losses in men and material and making plans to prevent another such holocaust . If he had been busy that morning , he was far busier now . The one plane which had n't been burned was badly damaged . Its future usefulness would be limited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to repair other cripples . That chance came all too soon . As if our Grumman had not already suffered enough , the four which had been out on patrol duty suffered another casualty when they returned . Three of them landed safely on the runway , but the fourth failed to clear a mesa of heavy debris which was cluttering up the coral strip and came to rest with a bent propeller . Our mechanics got busy in a hurry ; they took a prop from a strafed plane and fixed it in place on the latest victim . Now Wake 's air force was down to just four planes . God knows , twelve Pled been few enough , and now , four ! Paul Putnam was a pretty sober young commander as he and I went over the field together , after the dead and wounded had been removede-Alt-leaus areas adjacent to the runway had been het y pounded , the itself-had- net-re-ceived a angle hit . We ascribed thescircurostence to  --  poorsheesting. events make itseeemsenorerei able that the Jape deliberately sparTfie strip , with an eye to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raid was merely a raid to us ; we did n't guess it was a prelude to a land attack . Evidently the Japs had been determined to wipe out our air power at no matter what risk to themselves . Counting on surprise for protection , they had come in at the recklessly low altitude of 3000 feet and used their machine guns with devastating effect . We paced the distance between crater after crater and found them identical  --  roughly , fifty feet . The bombs from every plane must have been dropped ennuitaneously at a signal given by the leading bombardier . Provided the other bombers were prompt in releasing their eggs at the given word , one of two effects would be thereby achieved . The bombs would all miss the target area or else they would simply blanket it with well-spaced hits . That would explain how , in the case of Wake Island , they were able to shower he airport with such well-spread de-ruction that they ruined all our planes at one crack . Putnam described the tunt as " pattern bombing . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which has since been generally accepted . Another way of saying the same thing is " checkerboard bombing . " We got as much of the debris cleared way from the bombed area as possible that afternoon . There were no dead or wounded at Camp 1 or on Peale Island . But the camp had taken a nasty shellacking from those pattern bombers . The officers ' mess and the mess hall were wiped out . The pumps in the evaporator system had been destroyed , rendering the plant useless . But we had some 600,000 gallons of fresh water stored in reservoirs , and I knew there was another evaporating plant at Camp 2 . Whatever else we might have to face in the future , a shortage of water would not be one of the horrors . Scores of tents were rendered unusable , including my own . Then , at dusk , we fell in for a muster . The roll call told us the full extent of our casualties . It was dark by the time the muster was ended , and that finished all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rigorous blackout had been ordered . Deep in the shelter of the scrub , by the carefully shielded light of a small torch , I scrawled a few hasty lines to my wife . They sound downright jittery as 1 record them now : December 8 . Darling : A miracle of God ! I was spared today  --  though I do n't know how ! Poor Aviation ! Bombs all around us , and those men who could be seen were machine-gunned . We certainly were taken by surprise . We suffered tremendous casualties  --  awful . Sherman was right . The'airplane  --  a wonderful invention  --  is certainly the scourge of the skies . This is all right , if it is only with the thought that you have survived the attack . I hope everything is O.K. I signed my name and clicked off the torch . A cold drizzle was beginning to seep down through the trees . I stretched out on the wet earth and sank into a state which may have been sleep or may have been the stupor of exhaustion . It was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I awoke , cold and stiff . I stamped around to get my circulation started . Somebody , up even earlier , had brewed a pot of coffee somewhere . I could smell it , and I followed the arorruitic trail till I located the point of origin and secured a steaming cup . The sound of engines warming up came from the runway , and at dawn two of our precious remaining quartet of planes went zooming up . Paul Putnam had issued the order that henceforth and forevermore  --  that is forevermore while they lasted  --  two of our Grumman would go up at dawn and the other two at dusk to patrol the ocean areas south . In a conference during the previous afternoon , we had pretty well agreed on the locality from which the Jap bombers were working . Assuming they did not like to fly by night any more than other fliers , we figured they would operate on a schedule which would permit them to take off at dawn , hit the island and return home before dark . This indicated that they must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roughly 700 miles from Wake . Later it developed that our assumption was true , though their base was actually only 600 miles away . This established the hours between eleven A.m. and one P.M. as our danger period . In the main it held true , though the Japs were clever enough to vary the schedule occasionally . For two or three days we carried on practically without food , and nobody seemed to give a damn . We were all too busy to worry about meals . When we got a chance we raided the scattered stores lying in the debris of the mess hall , busted open a can of something and wolfed it down , then hurried back to our job . Once more the same tall gangling young private who had helped carry the stretcher made of burlap ripped from around the latrine turned up trumps . He volunteered now to be pot-walloper for our mess , and became our mess sergeant , cook and dishwasher . That arrangement held for about a week , when Dan Teeters and his civilian workmen took a hand and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had regained our normal appetites , and Dan saw to it they were satisfied punctually twice a day . But I 've got ahead of my story and I 'd better get back to the morning after the first bombing . The end of my walk brought me to the remains of my radio tent . The communications system I had come all the way to Wake to set up was practically obliterated . All the radio equipment I had brought with me on the Wright was destroyed . I was definitely out of business . To add to my unhappiness as I viewed the wreckage , I received the bad news from the naval hospital at Camp 2 about the death of Conderman the night before . I was terribly shocked . but curly-haired 2nd Lt , Carl R. Davidson , of Teaneck , New Jersey , was maddened to a state of cold fury . Already bitterly resentful at the death of his close friend , Jack Holden , the day before , he now had to strike another name from his list of friends . He looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Okay , " he said tightly . " That 's at least two of the swine I mean to get ; one for Strawberry and one for Jack ! " It was more than a threat ; it was a promise  --  a promise he was to fulfill in the next few hectic days .
