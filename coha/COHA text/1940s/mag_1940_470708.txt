Tr is just a small cargo ? a freight-air you call it . But it will leave tonight , and I can give you a cabin ? yes , for just you two of course . " The director paused , his pleasant face , which had looked rather troubled , slowly brightening . " Le Commandant est trPs gentil ? the Captain is one ver ' nice man , " he said , shifting from French into slow and careful English . " We will do the best we can for you , the very best . What do you decide , Mesdames ? " We decided to go . For we had been in Bordeaux for two dreary weeks , along with thousands of other Americans who longed to get home and were mobbing the steamship offices for reservations ; and accommodations even on a small freighter were welcome . That evening , with a dozen other American refugees , a Czech with an Argentinian wife , two middle-aged English spinsters with a dog , a young Austrian Jewess who was all alone , a Mexican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a Greek who resembled no one in particular , we embarked at Bordeaux on the French Line cargo vessel San Pedro , for a destination vaguely defined as the North American Continent . Our first manifest task was to unpack and put our possessions in order . Our departure had been so precipitate that our preparations had been sketchy . Among the paper packages we had brought aboard was one containing a wet corset ? wrapped up in Paris-Soir ? which had been rinsed out that morning and which there had been no time to dry . It had dripped all over the dock and occasionally it had slipped , disclosing garters and straps . It seemed high time that it should be anchored somewhere , and a knob of the upper berth was as good a place as any for it . The cabin was better than either of us had expected . Besides the two berths , it contained a narrow settee covered with brown velvet , an armchair , a chest of drawers , a wardrobe with a long mirror , and a washstand with cold running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from any sort of plumbing except this basin . Investigation revealed that the deck where we were contained the quarters of the " ver ' nice captain " ? as yet undiscovered ? situated between our cabin and another one like it , and nothing else . At the bottom of a flight of very dark , steep steps was a deck where there were four more cabins and the community bathroom which bore on its inner door the inscription , " Pri ? re de faire fonctionner la chasse d'eau asset longtemps pour assurer la propret ? de la cuvette , " which had been translated very freely into English , beneath : " Leave this chamber just a little better than you found it . " There were indications that this injunction had not always been heeded . On the deck below were the officers ' quarters , a tiny galley , and a small salon which served as dining room , smoking room , and lounge . Two tables , equipped with swivel-chairs and seating eight people each , ran across it sideways between a buffet and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with brown velvet . The walls were paneled in golden oak . The portholes , painted dark blue , were all screwed down tight . A steward was engaged in setting out bottles of mustard and yin ordinaire , in preparation for the evening meal . We returned to our cabin , finished our unpacking , and reassured an anxious sailor who was making the rounds to be sure that all the painted portholes were tightly screwed down and covered with curtains as well . We had been in Bordeaux two weeks , we told him , we knew the regulations . At the thought that within a few minutes we should be leaving Bordeaux our spirits rose . We washed in cold water and went down to dinner . It was not until long afterward that we discovered we both had had the same feeling as we seated ourselves at table : that we had suddenly stumbled into the raise-en-scene of another " Outward Bound , " not a stage version of a last journey , but a real one . Everything combined to contribute to this feeling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which we had taken in a spirit of mingled bravado and gratitude , because it offered us immediate departure and decent accommodations at a fair price , when we could secure none of these on an American ship . We had not hesitated to take the cargo , but now that we were on it , sober second thought compelled us to face the fact that we were about to cross waters strewn with mines and spotted with submarines , and that the result might be extremely unpleasant , to say the least . Neither of us gave tongue to this thought and , left to ourselves , we might have risen above it . The presence , and the behavior , of our tablemates made this impossible . The two English ladies were seated on one side of us . One was pretty and feminine , with soft gray curls , pink cheeks , and wide , childlike cycs . The other was masculine and protective ; she was heavily built and clad in serviceable sports clothes . They talked to each other in undertones , calling each otherdcar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone else at first , though they answered courteously when addressed . They were perfectly selfcontrolled , but their presence on such a ship , at such a time , seemed mysterious . The Czech , the Argentinian , and the Austrian on the other side of us were not controlled at all . The young Austrian , who was lovely looking and lonely , kept making little moaning sounds , and giving vent to soft , desperate exclamations , addressed to no one in particular . She was terribly pale and she clutched frantically at a large zipper-bag as if she expected someone to wrest it from her at any moment . The husband and wife were convinced that we should be torpedoed before the night was over . They said this so often , addressing everyone else at the table in a variety of languages , that it was all we could do to keep from asking them why they had bothered to come aboard if they felt their fate was so certain and so near . Resolutely we refrained and attacked the food that was set before us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never is . But there were unmistakable signs that the general nervousness pervaded the galley no less than elsewhere . The courses arrived in higgledy-piggledy fashion , some of them with no change of plate between , others with no accompanying forks and knives , and all of them at such lightning speed that it was not possible to swallow much of anything before it was snatched away . In the middle of this crazy service the steward paused with a plate he had just caught up still in midair and said he knew just how to please us , that he had waited on us before , on the lie de France , where , as we well knew , everything was perfectly done . It seemed like the final touch to a fantastic vision . " Andre , Madame a besoin d'un cendrier , " said a pleasant voice out of nowhere . We turned in our swivel-chairs to see whence the voice came . At the farther table , which had been empty when we entered the salon , beside another refugee American ? a mining engineer on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and disillusioned ? sat a man with a lean brown face , an aquiline nose , thin sensitive lips . The slight sharpness of the general effect which these gave was offset by a twinkle , apparently irrepressible , in the keen eyes , and a whimsical smile which appeared unexpectedly . He was smoking a stub of a cigarette tucked into the corner of his mouth , and he sat with his elbows on the table , slightly slouched forward , an attitude which was more graceful than it sounds . He was dressed in a rather stained and shabby uniform with four gold stripes on the sleeves and the red ribbon of the Legion of Honor in the buttonhole . Here , indubitably , was the " ver ' nice Captain . " II It was the next day at luncheon that the Czech , the Argentinian , and the Austrian began to question him . The interval had admittedly been trying . We had pulled out from Bordeaux about nine in the evening , hours later than the announced departure . Then we had gone jogging down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ship shook as though it had the palsy . Frequently it stopped altogether . When morning came we saw that we were not heading out to sea but creeping cautiously along the coast of France in a northerly direction , getting farther from New York every minute . This was too much for the self-control , if any , of the above-mentioned refugees . As the Captain slipped into his seat , as unobtrusively as he had the evening before , a barrage of questions was fired across the dining room . " Do tell us , Captain . What route are we taking ? We ca n't understand why . . . " " Route ? W'at route are we taking ? " The Captain 's face assumed a blank expression , as if he had never heard of such a thing as a route . " I don ' know , " he said pleasantly but vaguely . " I don'get my orders yet . I don ' know were we 're going . " " But are we going north instead of west to avoid submarines ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Submarines ? " inquired the Captain . " W'at you say , submarines ? W'at makes you think there might be submarines ? Did you ever see wan ? No ! Did you ever hear wan ? No ! Eh Bien ! Legends , that w'at they must be . Anyway , I don ' know anything about them . " He produced a funny little nickelplated gadget from his pocket and began to roll himself a fresh cigarette . " All I know is , " he said , in a slightly plaintive voice , " yesterday morning , nine o'clock , the General Passengair A-gent , he sends for me , he ask me if I could take five , six passengairs to New York . We nevair take passengairs to New York , this is a freight-air . But naturally , I say yes , if he want , we manage five , six . Two o'clock he send for me again ; he say , could I manage twelve passengairs . Que voule-vous ? I say yes again . Finally , dinnair time I find we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I going to think about a route , about submarines , about such things like that ? I got to look after nineteen passengairs ! " Somebody certainly had looked after them , very efficiently ; and when we caught the Captain testing the taps in the community bathroom which had declined to turn , and unobtrusively doing various other odd jobs of like nature , we decided that he did indeed have a careful finger in every problematical pie . The two English spinsters and their dog were installed in the cabin opposite ours . On the bathroom deck were the Czech , the Argentinian , the Austrian , the mining engineer , two girls from a dancing troupe with their Pekinese , and an American widow . In the Lieutenant 's quarters on the deck below were another American dancer and her mother . The bachelors , with the exception of the mining engineer , were all accommodated aft , in the San Pedro ' s infirmary . The " third class " passengers ate at eleven and six , and the " first class " passengers at twelve-thirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant that it was hardly ever available as a sitting room because a succession of meals was always in progress . I believe that the first-class menus were slightly more elaborate than the third-class . Otherwise no distinction was made between them . Lifeboat drill took place immediately after luncheon on the fast day out . It was considerably less perfunctory than such a ceremonial usually is on shipboard , and the Mate who supervised it adjusted the lifebelts individually to make sure that they fitted . He also gave detailed instructions concerning the small bags to be kept ready , packed with bare necessities , by our berths ; but to this rather grim reminder of what might happen at any moment was coupled the reassuring knowledge that the lifeboats had enough space for three times the number of persons aboard the ship , and that all were so readily accessible as to be reached within one minute . The drill was hardly over when the San Pedro , which had not been going more than six or seven knots an hour at any time , eased itself into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be desired , groaned , creaked , and came to a stop off Belle Ile . By dinnertime it was apparent that we were not going any farther that night . The barrage of questions began again : Why had we dropped anchor ? How long were we going to stay in this place ? What was it all about anyway ? " This is a ver ' nice harbor , " the Captain said cheerfully , " ver ' shallow . If there should be a submarine ? you said you believed in submarines , nr , n ? ? the San Pedro could n't sink . She is right on the bottom anyway . You can all have a nice , long sleep . So can I. Bon repos , Mesdames , Messieurs . " His assurances did not have the desired effect upon the Austrian , the Argentinian , and the Czech . With one accord they exclaimed that they would not beable to close their eyes . The word submarine had sent them into fresh frenzy . The Argentinian was especially vehement . " What is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclaimed . " We all know that we shall never reach New York alive . Well , then , we all know that probably we shall not . Oh , when I think of all that I have left behind me ! My charming apartment ! My two cats ! " We were very rude . We asked her why she had left them . " But Paris was about to be destroyed ! " she cried still more vehemently . " No , it is true that it had not been injured when we left , but at any moment bombs might begin to fall ! We fled to Havre and there an alerte took place almost every night . So then we fled to Bordeaux . But who could know how long that would be safe ? So next we took this boat . We thought we should be out of the danger zone by this time . And instead of that we seem to be staying in it indefinitely ! " It was a pity , we reflected , that such a pretty woman and one who might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of war her sole topic of conversation at meal times . It was not calculated to make good digestion wait on appetite . But her husband was not only afraid of the perils of war , he was afraid of everything . He carried Flit in a special suitcase , and insisted on spraying his surroundings at inopportune moments , to rid them of imaginary insects . He crept about , from deck to deck , peering into cabins and corners , in search of lurking dangers . He washed his dinner plate himself , and then declined to have this changed because he was persuaded that there were germs in the galley . He ate only potatoes , bread , eggs , bland cooked vegetables , and cheese ; but when any one of these was passed to him he helped himself to almost all there was on the platter , either oblivious of the fact that there were others still to be served or unconcerned about it . Gradually we got used to all this , but that evening when the San Pedro lay off Belle lie we looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' have to get that good sleep just yet , " the Captain said suddenly behind us . It was as if he had divined everything that was passing in our minds ? the disgust , the captured feeling , the sudden longing for congenial friends round a festive board of our own . " Shall we make wan small bridge ? We are in this nice shallow harbor , we might have a littl ' game . At sea all lights out in the dining room at ten o'clock . Betair we play while we can . " We settled down at the end of one of the long tables , which by this time had been cleared of their yellow linen table cloths and ringed napkins , their carafes and mustard , and were covered with brown felt . The mining engineer had brought some cards and an old score pad with him . He produced these , thawing visibly . He played beautiful bridge , never making a mistake himself and never denouncing anybody else 's . The game was prolonged . By and by a young officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper . He waited until he was dummy , then he glanced at them . " Half-past six , " he said to the young officer , in a pleasant undertone . Afterward he rolled a fresh cigarette , picked up his newly dealt cards , and regarded them critically . " I bid three no trumps , " he said . Then he glanced round him as if to find anyone to challenge his bid . He nearly always did bid three no trumps no matter what he held in his hand , and what is more , he nearly always made his bid . We wakened next morning to a rocking ocean and knew then what half-past six had meant . But when we got out on deck we discovered that we were still headed north instead of west and still hugging the coast of France . By midafternoon we had come to a stop again , this time in the beautiful harbor of Brest . We were all asked to hand in our passports and to fill out elaborate forms telling MAGAZINE our life history , past , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when a little boat shot out from the shore , and the Captain , in civvies , stepped into it and chugged away . He was gone for a long while , and when lie came back he looked tired but triumphant . During dinner , as he parried the usual questions in the usual way , he studied the young Austrian as if he were concerned about her . When the other passengers had eft the dining room and we had settled down for another " small bridge " with the mining engineer as the fourth again the Captain told us what the trouble was . " That poor little girl , " he said . " She has a German passport . Eh Lien , how would she have anything else then ? W'at can an Austrian do ? The port authorities were agitated , they did not wish that she should sail . And her French visa good only for five days more ! W'at would have happened to her if I had put her off here ? Non , non , that does not do itself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now the San Pedro will take her . " He rolled his cigarette , picked up his cards , and glared at them . " Three no trumps , " he announced . The second bridge game was not so quiet as the first . The Czech , who had retired for the night ? or so we supposed ? apparently smelled it out . He returned to the dining room to tell everybody else what was wrong with the way they played . Then he remembered the submarines again . " I suppose there are a good many around Brest , huh ? " he said . " I suppose there are more here than anywhere else , are n't there , Captain ? " " Except in the Channel ! " exclaimed his wife , who had rejoined him by that time . " I am sure we shall never live to get through the Channel ! Do n't you think the Channel is almost certain to be fatal , Captain ? " " I don ' know , " said the Captain , shuffling his cards . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Three no . . . " " And then it is so dreadfully rough ! " she interrupted . " Even if we are not sunk by a submarine we are sure to be seasick . " " No doubt we shall be starting for the Channel at any moment now , " chimed in the Czech . " We shall be leaving Brest during the night , sha n't we , Captain ? I think I had better start to bed at once so that I shall already be undressed before it begins to get rough . I am such a very bad sailor . I remember once when I left Liverpool and did not get up again until I reached New York . Doubtless it will be the same this time . Unless we are torpedoed . Of course if there is an alarm I shall get up at once . Meanwhile I lock the door . In that way I am as safe as possible under the circumstances . " The Captain sprang up , scattering his cards as he did so . " You lock your door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cried . " And then if we are struck by a submarine you will be caught like a rat in a hole and your wife with you ! You will keep your door fastened open at night ! Every night , from now on , you will sleep like that ! It is an order ! " He sat down again , gathering up his scattered cards . " Mon dieu , these passengairs ! " he exclaimed . " On my freightair ! At ten o'clock in the morning , the General Managair , he send for me , he ask if I can take three , four passengairs ! W'at can I do ? I say yes , I suppose so , and then at three o'clock . . . " Every time the Captain told this story he had received a little less notice to get ready for the intruders , and the number he had originally agreed to take was a little smaller . Otherwise it did not vary at all . It was the leitmotif of his habitual song . In spite of the Czech 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We stayed at anchor there , through the bright moonlight which constitutes perfect submarine weather , and the mellow radiance of the gorgeous fall day that followed . Not even Rio in all its glory could be more beautiful than this spacious blue harbor guarded with tallshining cliffs . The ships surrounding us on every side rode proudly and easily on the waves as if they were live creatures . And yet there was something sinister , something mysterious , about all this beauty , as if hidden danger were coiled round it like a serpent , ready to strike at any moment . Were we staying still because we could not move ? If we did move what would happen ? We tried not to ask ourselves these questions . We tried not to look beyond the loveliness we saw to the menace we could not see . In the late afternoon a sudden stir , a sudden excitement , pervaded the motionless ship . Then , through the silence , came the first faint throb of the engines . As we slid slowly from our moorings we saw that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One ? two ? threefour ? five ? six ships , skimming over the blue water , pointing straight toward the setting sun , which poured out its splendor far and wide , making a golden path across an azure sea . " We 're all going out together ! We 'll be safe after all ! " It was one of the young students who spoke . We stood in the bow watching the glorious sight , feeling secure , feeling uplifted . The serpent had uncoiled itself and slipped away , far from that shining stream . Then something happened again . We saw that the other ships , one by one , seemed to be turning to the left , while we seemed to be turning to the right . At first we told each other that we were just getting into position . Then we pretended not to see what had really happened . The other ships had gone south , to Bordeaux , whence we had so lately and so longingly come . We were headed for the Channel , all alone . Strangely enough , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because we were exhausted by danger , even though we were not frightened by it . When we woke the ship had stopped again , and there was a sound of voices coming from the Captain 's quarters ? English voices , courteous but cold . The port officials of Plymouth had come aboard the ship and were asking searching questions of the Czech , the Argentinian , and the Austrian . It was obvious that they intended to be satisfied that these aliens should be allowed to proceed to the United States . We could not hear the words , only the tones . The little Austrian 's were shaking . She was a Jewess , she had waited and waited for her escape from bondage to freedom ; and now , on a technicality , she might be sent back to the doom of the German yoke . The Czech was strident and argumentative . You fool , you fool , we said to ourselves , lying very still in our berths ; if you are n't careful you 'll get sent back to your charming apartment and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And if you act this way it might end in having all aliens sent ashore . Do give that poor little girl a fighting chance , for life , liberty , and pursuit of happiness It was the Captain 's voice we heard next , suave and hospitable . There was a clink of glasses , a short laugh , a pleasant murmur ; the moment of tension had passed . It almost seemed as if a sigh were wafted through the ship . Presently the English officials went away , agreeable , satisfied . The Captain went with them . A little boat had come chugging out from shore as it had at Brest . But before he left he had gone round to each stateroom , knocked , and asked if anyone would like to have some errands done ashore . He would be glad to undertake small commissions ? cigarettes , candy , writing paper , out-going mail . There had also been a slight contretemps about port rulings , after the matter of the aliens had been satisfactorily adjusted . The British regulations are very comprehensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in telling us afterward of his predicament . He produced the formidable document which the Mate had filled out , and turning the sheets , pointed to a section marked with a cross . " Now w'at you think of that ? Animals -- -dogs , cats , we must say how manny we have of everything . I have told the port authorities we have three cats , I suppose that is all . I don ' know anything about anything . One of these cats , she just has three kittens . My Second has written in six cats on this papair . The British officer finds the item about the kittens I did n't declare ! Mon dieu ! Q , ue oaulez-vous ? " We expressed our sympathy to the Captain but we did not dwell on the matter very long because our attention had been diverted in another direction . As our stay in Plymouth , which had begun early Saturday morning , still showed no sign of coming to an end on Sunday at dinnertime , the Argentinian began to voice a fresh cause for alarm as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excellent repast . " No doubt we shall soon be running out of food , " she said encouragingly . " The Passenger Agent in Bordeaux told me the voyage would last ten days ? well , at the very most , twelve . Here we have been gone five already , and we have not even started across the Atlantic ! In five days more we know what to expect ! " She drained her glass of vie ordinaire , and her husband helped himself to a whole cheese . " It will not mat-tair if before that we have met wan of those ? w'at did you say they were , Madame ? Wan of those submarines . Then w'at difference would it make ? There are plenty of provisions in the lifeboats . " " Except ice water . If you will excuse me , Commandant , I will go at once and double the supply of ice water in those , " remarked the Mate , with a sly glance in the direction of the small bucket and the large carafe which always stood at our places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the side . The Mate , having finished his own meal , had assumed an attitude in front of the sideboard , and with gestures so excited that he seemed in danger of bursting off all his buttons , had begun to declaim . The mining engineer , the Chief Engineer of the ship , and the Czech had all chimed in . Only the Captain had sat on the sidelines , rolling interminable cigarettes out of his little nickelplated machine , and smiling his whimsical smile . When at last the Mate had cooled down , whether over his own joke about the ice water or something else , and disappeared together with most of the passengers , the Captain remained in his swivel-chair , leaning over the table , making pleasant , inconsequential remarks , and folding the menus into fanciful shapes , which eventually took the form of petites marmites and flying ducks . He did not say anything about " wan small bridge . " He was plainly preoccupied . At last , with the apologetic air of a host who feels that he has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nightcap . As Andre , the pseudo-stylish steward from the lie de France , set the ingredients for this down before him and he began to pour them out , we noticed that his hand shook , ever so slightly . It was at this moment ? for the shaking lasted only a moment ? that we felt sure we were leaving Plymouth during the night , and that this time we should be headed out to sea . We were not mistaken . Again , miraculously , we had gone soundly to sleep . But we were awakened by a tremendous clatter outside our open door . Heavy footsteps were coming up the stairs , and a hearty British voice rang forth , " Has the Captain gone out ? " It did not seem likely under all the circumstances that he could or would have gone out , and soon there were other sounds which indicated that he had not . After that we waited breathlessly for the throb of the engines . It was not long in coming . We got up and looked at the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep turned away from the blue-painted , curtained window ; for even a dial like this can be seen a longway off . It was just half-past-two , and we were " Outward Bound . " We went back to bed and fell asleep again . There had been rumors about a convoy , just as there had been rumors about many other things ? those strange whisperings of wartime that come from nowhere but which are not so easy to waft away again into space . This report , as it proved , had been made of more substantial stuff than most . When we unscrewed our porthole to let in the welcome morning air ( the breathless , stuffy nights were a trial ) we could see framed by its circle another freighter bobbing up and down close behind us ; when we got out on deck the sky and the ocean both seemed alive . Overhead two airplanes were swooping , and around a covey of cargoes , two destroyers were frisking , lightly turning up foam as they wove their way in and out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pure sport . One of the cargoes had an old-fashioned paddle-wheel at the back . Another , trailing its lifeboat after it , was so small that it seemed incredible that it could keep up with the others . But it did . It was bound for St. Pierre and Miquelon , the two small islands off the Banks of Newfoundland , which neither time nor tide have been able to wrest from France . It was of course French , like our own " freightair " ; all the others were English . Toward sunset the orange and crimson sails of a dozen Breton fishing smacks came into view . Both their color and their courage seemed a fitting complement for the convoy . We were sorry when we Ieft them behind . They made a fair picture seem fairer and a brave one braver . But it was late that night when we saw the fairest picture of all . Cautiously switching out the last light , the Captain opened the door leading from his quarters to the deck , and motioned to us to step out there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over it , all round us , the still dark shapes of ships were silently gliding forward . Not a sound came from any one , not a beam or beacon of any kind was visible . But overhead the moon , encircled by flashing stars , hung like a silver lamp . Transparent clouds , floating softly away from us , carried some of its radiance with them . The ocean was radiant too ; only at the horizon did its luminescence merge with the darkness . The silent shapes looked all the blacker against it ? giant coffins set down in celestial silver . " You nevair saw anything like that before , Mesdames , " the Captain said . " / hope you nevair will again . Beautiful , is it not so , as you look at it this way ? But that , Mesdames , is war . " IV We stayed with the convoy three nights and two days , finally slipping away from it , as we had joined it , under cover of darkness . Presumably we were out of the danger zone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The destroyers frisked about us no longer ; their gambols were reserved for ships coming from the other direction . The airplanes had gone humming back to their bases . The Breton fishing smacks , brave as they were , could not venture this far out . We were alone again . The Captain made our solitude seem important . " With the convoy we go only seven , eight miles an hour , " he said . " Now we go twelve , fourteen . We go'n'to hurry up , we go'n'to be the first French boat to make this crossing since the war . The Normandie and the Pe de France , they are both tied up at the dock in New York . Ah don ' know where are the De Grasse and the Champlain . Anyway , the San Pedro is the flagship now ! " No one can remain in a state of tension indefinitely , and presently we settled down to a serene existence . Some people got seasick and some people caught cold . The Czech belonged to the former category . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pseudostylish steward , belonged to the latter category . For a day or two he battled bravely against his symptoms . Then , apparently , he decided to resort to well-known remedies ? remedies which are , however , more efficacious when their beneficiary does not try to move round too much . It was evident to us when we entered the dining room for dinner that all was not well with Andre . The napkins , neatly ringed , which had been used for the third-class service , were lying in a heap in the middle of the table ; but none of our own was there . We courteously called his attention to this omission , but he waved it aside , and passed us the soup although he had provided no plates to put this in . By the time the roast arrived there were plates , but Andre balanced the platter containing lamb drenched in gravy as if he were doing a juggling act . We gently called his attention to the liquid dripping down our dresses . " Cela n'a pas d'importance , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him by that time . He was in a very playful mood . He quoted proverbs , burst into snatches of song , and tossed the oranges which comprised the final course first to one passenger and then to another . The more extraordinary his antics became the more frozen silence enshrouded the dining room , broken only by hysterical giggles from the little Austrian . But when Andre , whose breath by that time not even a Roquefort cheese could smother , finally slithered out of sight , the Captain gave a deep and audible sigh . " W'at am I goin ' to do ? " he said , " D'abord les sousmarins , puis les passagers , et maintenant le garcon ! Everythin ' goin ' from bad to worst . " The supercharged atmosphere cleared suddenly . Someone gave a wholly natural laugh , and then everybody began to talk at once , describing the special antic of Andre 's which in his or her opinion seemed most arresting . It was Late before we started on our little bridge . This now took place in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dancers , and the students overran the dining room in the evening , while the Czech cowered in his berth , and the two English ladies explained that they preferred to spend their evenings alone in their cabin . It was a welcome diversion after the long days , during which we both resolutely wrote , having observed the various evil effects , mental and physical , of idleness on the rest of the passengers . But usually we stopped at the rubber which ended near eleven . This time , however , the game was close and exciting , so we went on playing . We were in the middle of one of the Captain 's three no trumps when a dull , sickening thud , followed by screams , caused us to spring up with one accord and make for the deck below . The lady whose son had decided that it would be best for her to take this boat while he remained behind in Bordeaux had fallen out of her berth , the upper one , over the little Austrian . No one knew exactly how it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sea was perfectly calm . Possibly the ladder had slipped when she was on it , though there was no way of determining this . But the fact remained that she was prostrate on the floor , with a Pekinese , who had strayed in from the dancers ' cabin , sniffing at her feet . It was evident that she was in considerable pain , besides being terribly frightened . Someone had arnica , someone else had a bandage , someone else had a sedative . By slow degrees her most immediate needs all received attention ; she was hoisted back into bed , and everyone else dispersed . Not , however , for long . We had hardly settled down in our own cabin when we began to smell smoke . We both tried to pretend it was imagination , but the actuality proved too strong for us . We arose , put on the black silk housecoats which we had rather hesitated to bring to Europe at all ? since of course we should always have private bathrooms ! ? and knocked respectfully at the door of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are very sorry to disturb you . But we are quite sure we smell smoke . " The Captain was still up . ( He and the Mate both kept twelve-hour watches , since they declined to let the younger officers take the responsibility for these alone . ) He gave a startled exclamation and dived down the stairs , followed by the passengers , whose number increased every minute , and whose toilets were for the most part sketchy . The farther down we went the thicker the smoke became . When we reached the Mate 's quarters we found that it was pouring out of his door . He had a bad case of asthma and was burning a smudge to assuage it . V Bad weather and desuetude settled down over the " freight-air . " The sailors , who had begun to paint it gray while we were at Plymouth , continued their task ; they put up signs , " Mind the peint , " which were not always successfully heeded . The officers hung a large sign marked " Private " in red letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and when two of the dogs were bathed in the community tub , which we already approached with a certain reluctance , we wished we could do the same thing . One of the dancers , who had been a beautiful blonde when we left Bordeaux , began to turn , slowly but surely , into a brunette ; two inches of dark hair sprang out arrestingly from her scalp . The young men quartered in the infirmary ceased to shave . A mild romance sprang into being between one of them and the little Austrian ; but it did not progress very fast or very far . Beautiful balmy weather announced our entrance into the Gulf Stream , though the Captain still looked blank when anybody spoke to him about a route . ( " I don ' know . I don ' know anything . Panama , maybe . Maybe Martinique . I saw some seaweed . " ) Then came the unmistakable fog and wind of the Banks and a light which unofficially proclaimed Nantucket . The Captain made a casual suggestion . " Maybe you like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ territorial waters now . You write them out , I okay them for the T.S.F. " " Some little messages home ! " There were sudden lumps in our throats . For sixteen days not a single wireless had been sent out from the ship ; it is too easy for submarines to compute the position of one from these . We had not even been allowed beforehand to say what boat we were taking . We knew that by this time our families must be almost frantic with fear . We typed out our little messages with thankful hearts and then we dressed for the Captain 's dinner . It was a very gala occasion . We all met in his quarters for cocktails , even the English ladies who emerged from seclusion , and the Czech , who forgot to be seasick . As the drinks circulated , the Captain drew from a drawer the map showing the positions of the submarines that had been sighted during the voyage , and the pink slips bearing the little messages regarding these ? for wireless had been received , though not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submarine at the very entrance to the harbor by Belle ile ? so that was why we had run in there , not because the water was so nice and shallow ! Of course there were a flock of them in the Channel ? that was to be expected . But the last one , the one from which we had been only thirty kilometers away , two days before we reached territorial waters ? well , that did not seem quite so logical . But the submarines were behind us now , as well as the voyage . We went down to dinner in the best of spirits . The Argentinian 's fears concerning a food shortage had not been justified , and it was a very good dinner indeed . Everyone complimented the Captain . He shrugged his shoulders . " Que voulez-vous ? The San Pedro is the flagship now ; we shall not call her a freight-air any more , we shall call her a luxury line-air . Has she not taken you on a splendid cruise , showing you beautiful harbors ? Mais oui , nous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mire sante , Mesdames , Messieurs ! " We drank our toasts standing , but it was to him , not to ourselves . He smiled his little whimsical smile and turned away . However , we knew he was pleased , pleased and very touched . He did not joke , for once . He did not say anything at all for a few minutes , and though we had all been so gay a little while before , we were moved , too deeply moved to say much either . Each of us knew that the other was thinking of all we had been through ? and of all we had escaped . Then the Captain got slowly to his feet . " Voyons , " he said huskily , " voyons . We must have one more small bridge before we say good-by . " The San Pedro steamed into New York harbor at noon the next day . Thcrc were mists early in the morning , but these gradually melted away . As we slipped slowly up the Hudson River , we saw all our surroundings gilded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fussy ferry boats , the endless docks , the multitudes that peopled them . The little Austrian stood looking out at them with a transfigured face . To her they represented a new heaven and a new earth . To us they represented home . Who can say which is the better ? Our families and friends were waiting for us on the dock ; we were caught up in the warmth and relief of their greetings . Then the customs and reporters engulfed us . But not entirely and not for long . We had asked the Captain to give us the privilege of presenting our own people to him , and we watched and waited eagerly until the slight , nonchalant figure , with its jaunty air and its well-worn decoration , came into view . " Kitty , " we said excitedly . " Eleanor ? Julian ? John . We want you to meet the Captain of the cargo . " Our eyes met in the midst of the flutter of introductions and the cordial clasping of hands . Then , under our breath , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ver ' nice man . "
