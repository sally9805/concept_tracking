The weather around Moscow had chilled , the ground had hardened . Suddenly , despite discomfort , despite disease , despite losses , the Germans struck harder than ever . They launched an offensive " the like of which , " a Soviet spokesman said , " has not yet been seen . " <P> For several weeks the Russians had been building formidable defenses on Moscow 's flanks at Kalinin and Tula . The German drive was designed to circumvent , and later destroy , those two key areas of defense . One German column drove between Moscow and Kalinin . This week it reached a point 30 miles from the capital . Another column skirted Tula to the south and then swung north across the Oka River . <P> Moscow the city might be as hard to storm as Leningrad the city . But last week 's offensive was apparently aimed not at the city itself so much as at destruction of the great Russian Armies on its flanks .                 @ @ @ @
