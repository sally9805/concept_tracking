txt Horace Mann to Be Closed in ' 48 ; Parents , College Plan Court Test Rejecting the vigorous pleas of the Parent-Teachers Association , ' the board of trustees of Teachers College , Columbia University , has voted to close Horace Mann-Lin- ' coin School , one of the leading progressive institutions for elementary and secondary education in the country . Approving the 119-page report of a special committee , the trustees , at a closed meeting on Thursday , continued the life of the school until June 30 , 1948 . After that the $3,000,000 grant made by the General Education Board , together with the building at 123d Street between Amsterdam and Morningside Avenues , will revert to Teachers College . Although the parents have threatened court action over the transfer of the trust fund , the trustees have anticipated this move by directing the college to ! seek a declaratory judgment to determine whether it has the right to sell the building and appropriate the various funds for other purposes . Expressing disappointment at the trustees ' decision , the parents ' group refused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gimbel , president of the association , declared that " this action is exactly what we had expected . " She said that the parents would immediately join with the trustees in asking for a declaratory judgment to restrain Teachers College from abolishing Horace Mann-Lincoln School . " The parents are convinced that the school must continue , " Mrs. Gimbel asserted . " It may be necessary to operate it under a separate board of trustees . We are willing to take over the school and put in a board of trustees consisting of prominent educators and laymen who are interested in progressive education . The parents // are not going to let the school go by default . " Although the present controversy began.on Feb. 18 , when Dean , William F. Russell of Teachers College announced to has faculty that the administrative staff desired to close the school , the fight over this institution , commonly known as the " cradle of progressive education , " began more than five years ago . In 1941 , over the protest of the parents , Horace Mann and Lincoln School @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Teachers College was within its bounds in merging the two schools . Broader Experiments Urged In their report the trustees traced the history of Lincoln School and presented arguments ' for its discontinuance . The time has come , the report said , when the efforts of the college should be expended on public rather than private school experimentation . In this connection the college announced that it was cooperating with a number of public schools in various parts of the country , including New York City . The fundamental intention of the General Education Board , the trustees held , was to further experimental work in elementary and secondary education . This purpose can be carried out more effectively , the report suggested , under the new plan . According to the report , it would be impracticable to continue the school if Teachers College is to emphasize public school experimentation . The money to be derived from the sale of the building ? it is estimated to be worth more than $1,000,000 ? together with the $3,000,000 foundation funds , will be used in the new public school program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pull of old loyalties , we have been forced to the conviction that Horace Mann-Lincoln School is no longer an effective instrument for experimentation , " the trustees declared . " What future circumstances may dictate we do not know ; but , under the conditions which now obtain , it seems to us that the operation of a school of this character is unlikely to result in significant contributions to education for all American youth . " We therefore concur ? in the opinion of the administration that Teachers College should cease to operate the school and that the General Education Board funds should no longer be used for its support but for other projects . Adequate provisions for teachers will have to be made by way of annuity payments and discontinuation allowances . " City May Buy Lincoln Building Just what will happen to the Lincoln school building is undecided , although Teachers College has conferred with the Board of Education as to its sale . It is likely that the building will be sold to the city to be used as a public school . The building , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is modern in design and can house 1,200 students . It is planned to use the building for elementary school purposes . According to the college , the Institute of School Experimentation will be stressed in the future . Basic problems in education are to be examined and explored . Three fundamental studies are to be made : ( 1 ) the social foundations of education ; ( 2 ) child development and the curriculum , and ( 3 ) a design for the curriculum . Experimental work is being , done in Evander Childs High School , the Bronx , Brooklyn High School for Homemaking and Public Schools 44 , 114 , the Bronx . In addition , Teachers College , has started projects in schools in Denver , Kansas City , Mo. ; Radford , Va. ; Montgomery County , Md. ; Springfield , Mo. , and Newtown , Pa . In addition , the college is operating an institute program in a number of communities . " The plans for the future call for the further development of the Institute of School Experimentation , " the trustees declared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basic importance now needing study and experimentation , and such problems will receive attention ; but there must be choices as to the order of attack and there must also be constant discovery and definition of new needs as they develop .
