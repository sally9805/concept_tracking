 | Stephen said no more . He filled his plate with soup and bent his head over it . The talk began again . This Calypso was always a matter of interest in the fisheries . She was a handsome Nova Scotian vessel , and the only schooner on the Banks that was owned , captained , and manned by Negroes . They were all good men aboard a vessel , and lived as free men in a province where freedom received more than lip service . They were the descendants of slaves . Not of field hands out of Southern slave pens and breeding huts . No , their ancestors had been English slaves : houseboys , butlers , coachmen , and seamstresses who had been carried to Boston in the colonial days and taken to Nova Scotia by the Loyalist masters after the peace of our Revolution . French and Indian blood had spoiled many . Others had kept their African strain untouched ; and even now , generations after , revealed the ancient beauties of the African civilization in proud carriage , great strength and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were spoken with Yankee clearness . Bereft of their own names , they had taken those at hand in the old days . Thus Cornwallis . Such were the men of the Calypso . A strange thing was said of them : that at night , under a whole mainsail and a full moon , their manly chorus might be heard , pealing out a mystic song which celebrated the beauty of the sweet African earth , the splendor of African seas , and their own desire to return to that land . Now , on this afternoon , they drove eastward to kill halibut where few vessels went in the best of seasons and none ventured in the winter-time . Someone said : " The Calypso did well last year . " Stephen lifted his head from the untasted soup and exclaimed harshly : " Not by going home with empty pens ! " His anger hurt their hearts , which were unused to it . The Philadelphia said : " Empty pens ? Empty , my boy ? " " Number Three is n't half full . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said anything about going home ? I 'm sure I did n't . " This was true . He had n't . It was hope that gave a little meaning to empty words . But this  --  this was a crazy way to talk to a doryman , even if he was the Mara 's first officer and her owner . Stephen had not only committed the sin of anger . He had also rebelled , had committed an act of insubordination . He was interfering with a captain 's judgment . The captain 's next words betrayed everything . It was time speaking ,  | not he . The words : " I was thinking of clearing out . But if you want to fill up Number Three  --  why , go ahead ! " Thus Stephen , for the sake of a few fish , toppled reason down . He gave his anger full play . More than that , he left his belly empty . And that 's a dangerous thing to do . He rapped his spoon down and muttered this answer : " Fill her up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swung out of his place and jumped to the steps of the companionway . The Mara lurched violently . Stephen swayed , his head down , his hand reaching for the rail . He caught hold and heaved himself upward . Even then , The Philadelphia might have saved all . He had merely to say : " Headstrong ! " and : " Turn in , boys . Sleep it out till Boston . " He could n't do it . His time was up . He was Captain Philadelphia Mulligan , Retired . What had tipped the scale of judgment ? Anger ? Yes . And the passage eastward of the indomitable Calypso ? Yes , that subtly added a few grains of weight . Chief of all reasons , however , was time . Time . The Philadelphia had no more of it to his credit in the great bank . Nothing to draw on in that place from which he had drawn sixty wonderful years . ' T is the law of Nature : so much  --  then no more ! The mighty had fallen . Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected by them and by The Philadelphia himself , had now come . Yet they resented the manner of its coming , which was too rough , too bitter . This should have been done gracefully at home , and with decent words , hands held out and clasped , and  --  who knows ? ? perhaps a wonderful sentence or two from The Philadelphia , something that , conceivably , might cause a rightful tear or two . Ah , it would be grand to be able to tell the grandchildren : " Aye , dearie ! Aye , duckie , I was aboard the Mara that day when the great Mulligan stood up and said : Chums ? . ' " Will O'Malley took up the task of voicing the general feeling . He said : " What 's the matter with him , would you say ? " The Philadelphia smiled dreamily . Abel set the example of proper action . He moved out of his place and opened the door of the shack locker . He laid a few slices of beef between slices of bread , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towel and thrust the bundle into his jacket pocket . He said cheerfully : " Steve will be good and hungry by the time we haul . " Thus , by this simple act of thoughtfulness for the angry man on deck , Abel saved his own life and Stephen 's . In the afternoon , they sent the dories over . Far to the eastward , the topsails of the Calypso twinkled . The bergs were not to be seen . Why ?  | Because something had hidden them . Something that the Mara could n't see . But the Calypso could . Her topsails vanished . She had furled them . She did n't change her course . " Dory away ! " Into the black stream , Abel drove her , speaking casually , adroitly to the gloomy man amidships . By his talk , he strove to take off the new burden that Stephen bore . Not voiced , yet fully known to both , was this fact : that , as the owners of the Mara , they were now brought to a momentous change . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captain of his choice had served long and well . A new captain had to come up out of a dory . Yes , Stephen Delahanty had become skipper of the Mara . He was so in spirit , if not in letter . The change itself should come at Gloucester . This was understood between the brothers . Stephen said : " Did it strike you that he suffered something at table ? I do n't mean a twinge , Abel , or an ache . I mean a deep blow inside him . " " Why do you ask ? " " You said a moment ago that he became tired . Very tired . And quite suddenly . " " Yes , that 's so , Steve . I saw him sigh . And then he yawned . Really , he almost fought for air . And it seemed to me that he became a little greyer . " " Lost some color ? " " Exactly . " " I saw that , Abel . I saw that . I 've noticed it before . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had figured his time was n't up yet . That he had some seasons to go . Not many . No ! A few . Perhaps one or two . " " And you were right ! But did I ever tell you what he said to Michael Dillon when the new dories were hoisted aboard ? " " That 's two seasons ago . " " Yes . " " No . I do n't remember that you told me , Steve . " " He said to Michael : This is the last set of dories I 'll ever buy for her . These will outlast me . ' " " Ah ! " By this time , they had thrown out the windward buoy and had tied up to the leeward ; and there , laying on the ends , , they awaited the fishing signal from the Mara . Once there had been a flurry of snow ; again , the cold increased suddenly until , at times , spray froze on the  | gear . The wind began to jump around a bit . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottom-boards to keep out of the weather . Stephen said : " I 'm famished . " Abel sat up on a thwart and took out the sandwiches . He handed two of them to his brother and said : " This will keep you until we get aboard . " Stephen ate the food . The wind having slacked up considerably , Abel took his place on the thwart . He beat his arms to keep the blood stirring . He took fresh gloves from an inner pocket and put them on . A flight of birds shot across the dory . Flying in silence , the birds passed westward toward distant Sable Island and the mainland far beyond . A solitary gannet swerved away from the dory and cried out . The wind hauled across to the north , blew fairly hard , then lessened and began to blow steadily from the northeast . For a little while , the sky became dappled . Rainclouds jumped up from nowhere and darkened the sea . Abel began to look about with a livelier interest . From far away there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a giant had come across a great glass window and had merrily kicked it in . This came from the southward . Abel looked in that direction . The sky shone blue there . Nothing stirred . He saw the smoke of a freighter rising from a half-seen hull . He then spoke the usual and ancient phrase : " I do n't like this ! " " No more do I ! " Stephen stood up to look things over . As if to assure them that no harm was meant , the sun cleared away the shadows . And the sun hung up a little tinsel here and yonder , nosegays of foam to glitter above the green . The wind became warmer . Yes , it had been so cold that even a brief downpour of sunlight made a difference to Abel . He waited , his hand on the gunwale , while the dory slid easily down into a trough . When the next sea heaved under her and jolted her sunward , he saw the Mara jogging away . She sailed two miles to the eastward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her nosegays , and even made a little rainbow for herself in the fresh dazzle . She had such a bustling , sheepdog air about her that Abel could n't help smiling in satisfaction , familiar as the sight was to him . He said : " Nothing bothering the old lady much . " Just as he said this , the Mara blew the fishing signal . This single note of her horn rolled smartly across the whitecaps and burst against the dory-side . Begin !  | " He says : Fish ! ' " Abel leaned out and caught the buoy with his gaff . Stephen said : " ' T is all right then . I 'll haul for a start . " His " all right " meant that he and Abel were to accept the Mara 's opinion of the weather . Her opinion , of course , was The Philadelphia 's . He had made up his mind , without help or hindrance this time , and had issued the order . And they accepted it . Why ? Such an acceptance might strike some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dorymen ( or owners ) who had decided , a moment past , that their captain had come to the end of his usefulness . They had put him on the shelf . Now he became the commander again . This quick change was n't too easy for Abel . When Stephen said : " All right ! " Abel had given him that characteristic sizing up , a strong sideways glance and a twist to his lips which added up to a sad look , yet touched with merriment , as usual . The result came to wryness . He had his mouth fixed for something like this : " What the hell 's the matter with you , chum ? Off and on again ! Make up your mind , please , and keep it so . " He did n't say it . He did n't say anything . After all , the schooner had to be their capitol , even if the President had been voted out of office . Her position remained sound enough . She , for example , had the glass to go by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fair " or at it , she had the right to speak as she had spoken . Abel made his way aft with the buoy , stowed it , and carried a trawl tub forward between the thwarts . Stephen hauled . He went at it slowly until he set well in the dory . It seemed to be cranky . His first hooks were bare . The next brought up a few haddock . He slatted them back into the middle-place . The cod then began coming up . Stephen showed his pleasure in the change and hauled swiftly . He took in fifty , a hundred . His excitement grew . He shouted : " I 'll finish it off here , Abel ! " By that he meant he wished to do all the hauling . These were his last words for some time . Abel shouted : " O. K. ! "  | 8 IT WAS THEN that the no'theaster began . They had just one warning : a repetition of that uproar of glass breaking . This time it clamored on a grander scale , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smithereens upon the spires and pinnacles of icebergs . Aye ! no more than that ; and the gale came slewing across the world , and master of it . Stephen and Abel bowed their heads to take the first assault of hail . The seas bounded cross-tree high . The wind tore off the crests and flung them westward . There was a retreat , a retreat toward the sun , which lay hooded a time and then vanished . Brain and hand failed in that onslaught . Only one thing cunningly and stoutly resisted the new master , and , indeed , challenged it and began the battle at once . The dory . Even more than the Mara , and more than the two savages crouching behind the high side , this dory was the child of such gales , had been created by an age of them . Here a little , there a little , a tenth of an inch added up forward and a tenth taken off amidships , she had changed in the centuries of striving for perfection . Her sides had become higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been made to receive and sustain ten hard blows at once ; and to yield and rise again . Her flat bottom held a lot of fish . It also kept her floating evenly when whirled from sea to sea . Yes , the Yankee dory had always been a cradle for heroes . A cradle created by heroes for their own use , and for their descendants . Long since she had been made perfect . She had outworn numberless gales . Dorymates had lived enormous lengths of icy days in her , borne on by faith in her and by faith in one another . Through bergs and vapor and blizzards , she had carried  | men two hundred miles to shore . She required only one help : a true man to stand by , to lend a hand , and haul her up , high and dry , when the gale had gone . This dory had such men . If she could have spoken with knowledge of her fate : " The Delahantys for my choice , the sons of Duncan . Because the apple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The dory took the first blow broadside on . She had been halfway up a sea at the time . The gale caught her there and pounded her so hard that she went deep into that tumbling wall . She climbed across the sea , just the same , and slid down into a chasm , a cleft in the world . There , under a canopy of foam , she lay cozy for a second or two while the gale drove over her . Thus she gave to her men the time needed . No more , no less . Abel rolled onto the thwart , seized his oars and struck short and deep . Stephen laid hands on the fish at Abel 's feet and flung two over . He howled . Aye ! he let out a true howl , an aboriginal declaration of war . The gale struck him across the mouth with a lash of hail . His boots slipped on the cod . He fell to his knees . In striving for balance , he flung out his hands , held them so momentarily . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sucked in , his eyes turned upward in the glance of desperation . Even in that posture , he caught up fish in his hands and flung them into the foam . A sacrifice , devoured by things of froth . The dory now ascended lightly from that poor shelter . The wind took hold of her and tumbled her , whirled her in pitch-poling style . Round and round she danced until , once again , she soared high on a crest and darted down a hillside . There Abel caught her and turned her into the wind . He rowed hard and held her so . Stephen began to bail . He got some of the water out of her ; then he cleared her of fish . All but one . This he gazed at briefly and looked at Abel . Abel nodded . His lips moved in a word that could not be heard . Stephen thrust the cod down into the coil of trawl . He lashed the trawl tubs and the single anchor together . He bailed again . So the afternoon passed . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the first commotion had taken place there . It had swung around swiftly to the northeast . This had a grave meaning to them : it would stay there . It had become a no'theaster , which must blow itself out , according to some universal need . Toward sunset , a graver sign was shown to them : the sky cleared in the west . The sun gave a little light . There then came a lull in the gale . Stephen rose in his place . He saw the Mara under a reefed foresail . She had taken up several dories and now steered to another . He began to bail , kept at it until he had cleared the dory.  | When a big sea lifted the dory again , he saw the vapor  --  the fog of winter  --  blowing in . He made a sign to Abel , who brought the dory around and began to row toward the Mara . A conch-horn called faintly . This appeal came from a dory already hidden by the vapor . Stephen took up his horn and waited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that moment , the other horn repeated its beseechment to the Mara . Stephen fell back to the stern-sheets and lay there , horn in hand . He listened . He waited for a sign that the other dory had been picked up . The Mara called out in a vexed tone : " Hoo-roo ! Where are you ? Where are you , dory ? " The small horn answered . This time the voices were closer together . The sun went down and drew with it that queer sort of illuminated greyness which had been the last of day . The sea and air became dark , each robbing the other of light . A flurry of snow swished through the vapor ; after that , the first slap of spray froze . Ice began to make on her . It was plain that the sun , dim as it had been , had kept the balance between freeze and flow . Stephen took two pairs of thick mittens out of an inner pocket . He gave one pair to Abel and drew on the others . He took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a cord secured to a thole pin . He held the bottle out to Abel . Abel shook his head . Abel rowed toward the Mara . He had seen her twice ; and he heard her at times in the wane and wax , clucking away and scolding . He rowed an hour . During that while , he and Stephen kept their eyes in constant communication . For half of that hour , the signals between the Mara and the other dory had not been repeated . Since he ran no risk now of delaying help for other dories , Stephen lifted his horn and blew . No answer came . He stood up and waited for the dory to reach the top of a comber . There , straddled in the pell-mell of foam and spray , he blew again . No reply came . Once more he waited until the dory sped out of a trough . In the little time she spent amidst the high foam , he blew louder than ever ; and added a piercing note at the end , which had an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mara , blamed her . " Where are you ? Why do n't you answer me ? " The whole night came upon the dory . She soared or plunged in a double darkness : darkness of night , darkness of vapor . Her leeward gunwale shone black ; the other gleamed with ice . They were now unable to see each other clearly . Stephen came away from the sternsheets and took his place on the after thwart . His boots lay against Abel 's . Abel began to row with a longer stroke . He kept turning his head this way and that . So did Stephen . Snow began to fall . At first ,  | the flakes were heavy and came down like straight rain . The wind had fallen off so much that the flakes continued to fall that way and did n't cause great hardship . Yet their thickness lessened the chance of making out a light if the Mara came up . Abel struck his boot against Stephen 's . This signal was plain enough . Stephen blew his horn many times . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her signal came down the wind ; this showed that the dory had passed her in the night . The Mara had been searching in the traditional zig-zag course up and down the line of buoys . In turning , she had run away from them . Now she turned again . Her horn called at regular intervals . Stephen answered . Her responses became clearer . Other horns , blown by dorymen on her deck , joined in ; and a bell chimed above their chords . Soon the bell rang alone , a pleasant song , at times muffled by pour of snow and headlong plunges of the dory down the sides of seas , yet nearer , always nearer , and sweetly singing out the story of a safe deck , a warm galley , and dinner by the same hand that rang the bell . A light appeared . Stephen saw it and shouted . Abel was looking over his shoulder at the time . He also saw the light and at once changed his course and began to row with a quicker , deeper stroke . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a high sea not far away . With no notice at all , except a roar hardly louder than the racket of the gale , an enormous sea rose behind the snowfall and fell upon the dory . It was the worst one they had yet encountered . The sea beat down the stern and rolled completely over it , filled the dory and bore it down . They could never have escaped by their own hands . A second sea followed . This one came in at a sharp angle , lifted the dory , tipped it . Half the water poured out ; and they might have gone out with it if Stephen had n't flung himself violently against the rising gunwale . He shouted . Abel answered . They locked arms to take the dive down into a new chasm , one so deep that they could n't see the foam at the top . Down they fell , and began to rise again , half buried in icy spray . They bailed . Clinging to her with one hand , they hurled the water out of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hour after hour they labored with the bailers until , at last , they had cleared her . Close on to midnight the vapor settled . A few stars came out directly overhead . This was a sign to them that the gale had not yet begun to blow . A stroke of good fortune came to them . Stephen had taken the oars . Just as he struck them in , the bow gave off a dull , thumping sound .  | In the next instant , one of the Mara 's buoys almost jumped into the dory . Abel seized it , found it fast to an abandoned trawl , and at once tied up to it with the dory painter . The buoy had this value : it gave them a mark whereby they might keep near the Mara if the buoy anchor did n't drag . Here they passed the night . Morning came . She came struggling , limping : the same crone , fumbling at the skeins of time . By now , Abel 's hunger had become an agony . Stephen had famine in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He waited until the dory lay on an even keel . He drew the cork and hastily sipped . Stephen did likewise . Abel reached into an inner pocket of his woolen jacket and took out the folded towel which held the last of the sandwiches . He cut it into eight squares . He gave one to Stephen and put another into his own mouth . He put the other morsels back into his pocket and began to chew his portion slowly . He swallowed it and found some comfort in the meagre bit . He lay down on the bottom boards and closed his eyes . The cold knifed him . Nevertheless , he rested . Stephen kept watch . There was nothing to see . Nor could he see far . The day barely lived behind the clouds . Squalls and flurries of snow kept passing over the dory . The sky echoed a clamor that increased and decreased , yet never passed away . There was no sense in calling , none in blowing the conch-horn . Much strength might yet be needed . Their store , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even if there was some use in it . Nothing could be paid out by hand or arm or voice unless the cold forced them into action to keep blood moving . Had there been any good in words , they would not have been able to say much . A word had become precious ; that is , the energy to think of a word , and to spit it out , had to be saved to keep breath whistling through bruised and brine-streaked lips . Yes , and to keep eyes open and turning , turning . Abel lay a while , not stirring . Soon the spray froze thick in the wrinkles and twists of his oilskins . Seeing that this was so , Stephen kicked him on the behind . Abel got up and sat on the thwart . He bailed an hour . When he had cleared the dory , another sea came in over her bow and filled her to the thwarts again . He bailed two hours . At the end of this task , he broke out the bag of crackers which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ate one cracker and gave one to Stephen . At the noon hour , or thereabouts , Stephen sighted a schooner a mile to the northward . She was hove-to and having a hard time of it . Seas broke over her deck so frequently that little could be made out . He  | could n't see her dories . At times , she sank in the troughs and only her topmasts showed . These leaned against the greyness . A considerable amount of vapor kept passing between the dory and the schooner . Stephen watched the vessel for some time . It was necessary to make sure that she was n't going anywhere . Abel also examined the schooner . At his nod , Stephen took in the trawl buoy and part of its road-line . He then sat to the oars and began the hard row into the wind ; for they had to come up to windward of her . Abel bailed . Now and then , when Stephen drove the dory up a sea , Abel looked at the schooner . In an hour or so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not much . Yet it was enough , considering that the schooner seemed to be making none . If yonder vessel was really the Mara , she certainly would keep near the trawl buoys , if that was possible . However , Abel could n't say for sure that the vessel was their own . In the early afternoon , the dory had gained so much that Abel made the vessel out clearly . He leaned forward and shouted : " The Mara ! " And : " I 'll spell you ! " He took over the oars . Stephen had become warmer at his labor . He had also become much weaker . He turned sick . He lay down on the bottom-boards and closed his eyes . He could n't rest , much as he needed it . He had sweated under the thicknesses of wool and oil clothing ; now the cold reached his sweat and made it bitter . He trembled , He sat bowed on the thwart . Once , while he bailed , the scoop fell from his hands . He gave up bailing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then set to work furiously and kept at it until she was clear . This was a good help to Abel , who had stepped things up until he had her making a knot . A squall set him back ; then a thick flow of vapor came down on the dory . There was n't much harm in this . Abel knew where he had to go . In time , he came to that place , where he turned the dory away and came swiftly down the wind toward the schooner . This had been a nice calculation , and well carried out . Suffering had not dulled their skills ; they had thought on their side , and a bag of tricks quite as old as gales . Their only new danger lay in the thickness of vapor , which increased the risk of passing the Mara without knowing that she was nigh . Now , as the dory ran before the wind , the vapor began to break up . Open spaces appeared in it ; frequently long aisles formed . Vistas . Vistas of dripping colonnades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bare that place where the Mara had lain . More than that , the sun , in going down , sent a long ray across the sea and lighted that place . The Mara had gone .  | Abel swung the dory into the wind . This proved to be a labor that he could n't keep up very long . Yet they had to stay right there . There was no other place to go ; at least , there was nothing better to try while they had hope of finding the schooner , or of being found by her . Stephen decided to put her to the drug . He lashed two buoys to the trawl basket . He broke in the head of one of the buoys . This gave him a fair sea-anchor . He heaved it over and paid out ten fathom of line . Abel took in his oars . At this time , a curious play of rose-colored flame began in the northwest . All the world lay a cloud , an immense and opaque mass stretching from sea to sky . No sunlight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark of night . Then , while the sun still rolled beyond , a part of its light spilled over the top of the cloud and , by some alchemy aloft , turned downward to the sea . Soon a beam of light pierced the underpart of that cloud and widened to a swath across the water to the southward . Both of these gaudy illuminations met and mixed a wash of color which played with violent changes on the vapor beyond , so that it seemed like a sunset reflected by a great wall . Crouching on the thwart , Abel gazed intently into that splendor . He saw the Mara sail through it . She worked under the same reefed foresail . She lay two miles away . In fact , she sailed almost exactly at the place where the dory had tied up to the buoy earlier . The Mara was making a shrewd search . No doubt about that . At his outcry , and the thrust of his arm , Stephen hauled on the line and brought the sea-anchor to the stern . He failed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abel hauled with him . Once free of the drug , the dory moved off briskly . Abel sat to the oars and let her drive toward the position where the Mara had been . By this time , that wondrous light had left the sea . Full night came on , attended by a snowfall and a squall that crossed the wind and blew hailstones into their faces . They accomplished the return journey in a tenth of the time that the windward row had taken . The speed was not an unmixed blessing ; it meant that the wind had begun to pipe up in dead earnest . This did n't surprise them . All the signs had foretold a long and violent gale . The gale had n't held off ; it had been making up . There was no doubt that by morning the dory would be under the worst strain yet . Twice they had to stop bailing in order to free her of ice , which often formed so quickly that the dory became cranky . Unable to speak , or unwilling to do so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchanged a hard look under half-lidded eyes . Each  | sought in the other a sign of confirmation for a thought unspoken , an acceptance that must now be made . The long glance ended with a nod of each head , a nod and a shake . This meant that they now gave up all hope of a rescue by the Mara . She would do well ( and wisely ) if she saved herself ; for the force of the gale plainly showed that she could not heave-to for long near the lost trawls . She must clear out , must run before the gale , unless she wished to run the risk of being hove down in a dangerous sea . What was there to induce her to a longer trial in this grey , howling world ? Nothing ! Common sense should prove that Number One Dory had gone down or had sailed away in search of land . Land ! Aye ! this now became Abel 's hope and Stephen 's . No help could be reasonably expected on the sea . Neither help nor food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their misery grew great because of a lack of these things . They yearned for rest with an intensity almost fatal to their will . Action  --  a straightaway action ? nothing else could serve them now . They wished to pour out all that remained to them , pour it out in one terrible combat to outlast the night and to fly on into a day that might be blue and leave them sailing as on an April morning . " How much ? " Kneeling between the thwarts to keep the salt off their stock of food , Abel held up the folded cloth . His mouth worked and lathered , and the lather froze in the bristles of his chin . " All ! " At this , Abel nodded , and crept forward until he knelt between Stephen 's knees . While Stephen held the oars in one hand , Abel handed him his portion and turned to devour his own . He devoured a torment . To bellies used to pounds of beef in a day , and pounds of solid bread , these tastes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's face when he swallowed . His heart understood this meaningless act and despaired . Each drank a full mouth of water , poured it across tongues that were swollen , and down throats so hot with thirst that nothing seemed to go beyond the throat . Nevertheless , they remembered each other at that moment , and in their hearts repeated the untaken vows of dorymates : never to falter , never to cease from thought and striving , never to give up until the gale had overwhelmed all thought , all love . Abel struck his hand roughly on Stephen 's straining knee , and , above the uproar of rising wind and falling seas , he shouted . Not a word . Only a shout . And Stephen , bending back to drive the oars in deep , came forward in a  | new sweep and shouted his reply ; and his face became beautiful again by its look of love for his dorymate . " Yo ! " Whither ? Why , to the nearest patch of sand on which they might fall and wait for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The name of that curl of earth was Sable Island . And how far to the westward did it lie ? Easy to say : the journey of a lifetime . Yes , a life could ooze away , gasp by gasp , curse by curse , before that sombre ridge lifted itself between sea and sky . And even then ? Hard to say . In times past and times present , many a seaman had triumphed vali11 antly over the sea and had died in the emptiness of Sable 's shores . There was no water there , no food . Sometimes there was snow ; sometimes human help . Thus many had lived . Therefore , Abel and Stephen sought to live that way . Thither they rowed . A following sea now sped by them , sometimes breaking over the stern , sometimes carrying the dory along , up hill and down dale , at a rate that made oars useless . Toward nightfall , their advance ceased . The alternate hail and snow had beaten them so cruelly that Stephen could no longer get about except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell onto the bottom boards and would have drowned in the wash there if Abel had n't seized him and dragged him to a thwart . In each man , strength seemed to wax and wane at different times . When Stephen could no longer lift a gaff to beat off the ice from gear and gunwales , a new fury took Abel and he did the work of two . An hour later it was he who stumbled and fell with such force that a slight blow against the sideboards disabled him ; and Stephen , dragging himself across the thwart , heaved against Abel with head and shoulder until his face lay clear of the salt . It became clear to them that they had to make a choice between a reckless gain of a few miles and a safer night spent with the dory to the drug . In the end , Abel put the sea-anchor over and the dory took the seas bow-on , yielding to the successive blows . They bailed . At midnight , they ate the last of the crackers and drank the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together in the stern and huddled there to rest a little . Their weight kept her bow higher and she tossed a while without shipping a great sea . Yet the increasing cold found them out , ate into their oilskins and passed slowly into their thicknesses of wool . This forced them to act . They bailed until there was no water left in her . They cleared her gunwales and their gear of ice . So the night passed ; and morning , noon , and a new night jogged by . In all  | that time , not one word passed between them . They moaned in secret . Again the day star , and with it no surcease . The wind changed and blew from the east for an hour , and blew so strong that they did n't dare take in their sea-anchor and go before it , as they had resolved to do , once the wind changed . A comber broke upon the sea-anchor and rolled over the dory . It bore much ice and they had trouble in clearing her . This they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Stephen took out his compass and made ready to set a course for Sable Island , according to his judgment . He had not enough light to see by . Out of the grey sky there came a grey wall of vapor which covered them and hid the slight downfall from the sun . Stephen knelt between the thwarts , one hand holding the compass , the other stretched on the gunwale . For a time , he stared listlessly into the stream of vapor . He seemed to be waiting for the sun to pierce the spray and cast but one beam upon the glass of his compass . Abel waited in the stern , his eyes fixed on the waves , which rolled toward the dory and under it . Now and then , a deeper roar overcame the din and a huge sea appeared . This he would watch with a lively look . When it had gone on , his head drooped again , and the icy brim of his sou'wester fell over his face and concealed its hideous purple hue . So did Stephen 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the compass began to fall . Twice he lifted it and pressed the compass to him . In the end , the hand fell . He kept his hold of the compass . Easily . His frosty mitten had stiffened around it .  | 9 THEY WERE BEGINNING to die . Had the dory been caught then in a cross-wind , or had a greater sea broken over her , it would have been the end . Even an hour of bailing lay beyond their present powers . They began to breathe in gasps , thus to avoid taking in too much of the blizzard . ' T was the last of their cunning , the last of a thousand doryman tricks they had learned from their father and a hundred others . Thirst and hunger had destroyed thought . A tenth of one of the Mara 's dinners  --  aye ! a hundredth  --  would have lifted them to their feet and to the oars . Even the hope of such an abundance might have done so . They had nothing ; neither hope nor bread . Stephen remembered one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerous thing : the fish . He crept slowly , with many a pause , to the trawls and , after much labor amid frost and ice , he dragged the fish free . He had dressed the fish before . Now he painfully sought his knife  --  the long , silver-hilted blade always carried by Mara men  --  and attacked the salty flesh . He cut a strip . It dangled , yet the skin baffled him . He lowered his head until his teeth could close upon the strip . He growled over the flesh like a dog angry for a disputed scrap . He cut another strip . This cost so much strength that his knife fell out of his grasp . He let it lie . Long he fumbled on the bottom boards to pick up that strip of flesh . When he succeeded , he could n't move . He needed his hands to move . One held the fish , the other his compass . He called out ; he croaked a summons to Abel . Abel could n't hear and he did n't see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and elbows to make his way through ice and water . It was long before he came close enough to strike his head against Abel 's knee . Abel lifted his head out of the ring of frost  | that had formed on his oilskins . He looked down at his brother 's face . He saw the purple and bearded jaw and the strip of flesh hanging from the bared teeth . Giving no sign of interest , he changed his gaze to the left hand which feebly beseeched him . He closed his eyes . Stephen chewed at the fish . The salt of it made him retch . He shook it out of his mouth and fell face down at Abel 's feet . Thus they remained a good while . At noon , a glint spun out of the grey wall to the southward . This sparse light vanished , flashed two times more , then spun off again . Soon a rift appeared in the wall . This deepened rapidly until an area of blue sky showed itself . These changes were accompanied by others : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less , the vapor thinned , and , just after the hour of noon , it moved off altogether . For an hour the snow fell . During this time neither Stephen nor Abel moved much . Flakes fell on their encrusted clothing ; they became snowmen in a snow dory . After the fall ceased , the sun came out and turned the day blue , and the sea also . A gull came down and wheeled with grievous cries over their heads . Other gulls came and cried in lamenting voices that they needed food . Like children wailing in hunger in Newfoundland cabins , the gulls ceaselessly wailed in their ceaseless patterns overhead . They chanted a song of the gale and told the bowed men beneath how dreadful the blow had been , day in , day out , and never a time to eat , never a morsel snatched out of the windy salt . As on many a day before , the gulls appealed to the men . They sang out to Stephen ; they appealed to Abel . Over and over again : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oh ! bitter is the salt wind in our bellies . Our wings fail . Have you nothing for us ? Nothing ? Nothing ? Ah ! Ah ! Rise , rise , Stephen ! Rip and slash ! Across the throat and down the fat belly ! Rise , rise , young Abel ! Toss the guts and livers to us ! We can fly no more , no more . Bootlessly ! Bootlessly ! " Heads hanging below white breasts , and red eyes staring , the gulls soared , cried out , and steered away down the wind and toward the beaming sun . The last among them wheeled , checked his flight with a wing upraised , and shouted a signal , a deeper , hoarser cry . He alighted on the bow and perched there and uttered an exclamation of triumph . He had seen the cod . This was a wonder to him . He celebrated and laid claim to it . Abel stirred . Once again he began his resistance . His first movements were those of a man coming out of a dream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and made a strong , groping gesture with  | his right hand . He twisted his neck until he found the sun . He gave it a grunt in greeting . He stared directly into the sun with his eyes wide open . When the light overpowered his eyes , he grunted again , this time in satisfaction . He had measured the sun . He began to flap his arms . This he could barely do . The back and forth movement seemed futile , even ridiculous , because he lifted his arms such a little way . Yet he persisted . He shifted in his place and began to nod his head up and down . Fragments of ice fell from the wrinkles of his oilskins . A circlet of ice , trimmed with Jack Frost 's lace , slipped from the brim of his sou'wester . All the gulls flew away and many sent down curses and cries of Shame ! Shame ! Only that one stayed behind ; in bravery he loitered . Keener than his companions , he had learned there was no cause for fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beak against the cod 's mangled belly . The cod had become a fish of ice . The gull raved against this loss and ran into the air . Abel watched him . Abel , the savage , watched cunningly , used a primeval slyness . He waited , then slipped to the bottom boards , his eyes turned in slyness from the hovering bird . His hands fell on Stephen 's cheek . He paid no heed ; only snarled at the obstacle . He crept over that body and thrust his hand down into the water . He fumbled and grunted in anger as he did so . He brought up the scrap that had been cut from the cod 's belly . He found the second scrap . He flung this one over the side . The action almost exhausted him because it was so powerful , so brisk . Yet he lifted his head over the gunwale and , out of the corner of his eye , watched the gull seize the flesh , gobble it , and dip his beak into the stream . Abel drew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its ganging and some fathoms of line . He pressed the strip of cod flesh onto the hook . This done , he rested for many minutes , his head bowed . The gull came down and shouted . Abel flung the hook over . The gull swooped and bolted bait and hook . He dipped his beak into the stream . He drank lightly ; and then drank deeply to wash the steel away . Abel grunted and jerked the line . The gull soared and fell . Abel dragged the bird into the dory . He struck at its head with his fist . The strong wings beat the fist back . The gull screamed in agony of steel and struck his beak against Abel 's hand . Blood came from the beak . Abel roared . He smashed the gull 's head between his mittens . He fell upon the bird and sank his teeth into its neck . He killed it . This done , he rested a long time . He sat up , took off his sou-wester and laid it upon his knees , upside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his will with more strength and liveliness . He slashed the gull 's head off with a single sweep of his knife . Black blood poured out of the neck , which cried out . Deep in the neck , a woeful cry bubbled . Abel cried out , too . For a man in his condition , he spoke with surprising clearness . And calmly . " What one can do  --  another may try . Drink ! " He held the shorter brim of the hat to his lips . He poured the blood deftly into his mouth . He gagged . Flecks of blood spurted between his teeth and reddened his beard . He swallowed . He ran his tongue back and forth across his lips . He bent his head back and swallowed . He labored over the taste and the after-taste . " A-a-h ! " He waited to see if he could keep the blood down . This proved , he flung the carcass down , folded the sou'wester brim to brim , and began his crawl toward Stephen . Three times he rested ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his bloodied hand across Stephen 's mouth . When he stirred and moaned , Abel thrust the hilt of his knife between the clenched teeth ; thus pried them apart . There he poured a sip of blood . It vanished . Stephen stirred and moaned . His tongue came up . Swollen by brine and thirst , the tongue came up all black with gull 's blood . " Drink ! " Abel bent his head and shouted into Stephen 's ear . " Swallow ! ' T is good ! Hot ! " He poured again , holding the brim between his brother 's lips . The dory lurched . Some drops splashed on Stephen 's cheek . Abel brushed these drops onto the searching tongue . One escaped . It ran to the cheekbone and there froze , became a ruby . Abel complained at this loss , complained in a mewing way . Stephen opened his eyes . An extraordinary light beamed therein . He had his wits about him . He spoke . His words were perfectly said , yet were small and seemed far off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Blue ! " Abel bent his head . " What say ? " " Blue ? " " Aye ! that 's right . Go on ! " Stephen lifted his mitten , caught Abel 's hand and pressed it to his breast . " Hear me ? " " Aye ! " " Course is West a half South . Sable Island . " " Aye , Stevie ! "  | " Not far ! " " No ! " Stephen pressed hard on Abel 's hand . He spoke with a firmness that cost him all he had . He spoke in fresh glory . His words revealed that he considered himself a gone man . " I am captain of the dory . Captain of our Mara . Obey me , Blue ! Obey ! " " Yes ! " " You live ! " He coughed harshly . " Only one can . " Stephen fumbled at the fastening of his oilskin jacket . " Open ! " Abel bared his hand and opened the jacket . Obeying a sign that he should search inside , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coat and the first woolen shirt beneath it . His fingers closed on a bundle , something wrapped in cloth . He took it out . It was the towel he had taken from the Mara to carry food . He carefully parted its fold . He grunted . Within the folds , which were somewhat dark with salt and sweat , lay all the food that had been Stephen 's share . He had eaten nothing , except a morsel that had been placed in his mouth by Abel . This morsel he had secretly taken out and had hidden it with the others . It was sodden with the water of his mouth . Stephen said : " Obey ! Eat ! All ! " Abel crammed the stuff into his mouth . He groaned . Lather streaked his lower lip . He bent over in pain and groaned again . Nevertheless , a measure of life jumped hardily within him . Stephen had more to say . He closed his eyes . He had spent so much that his words lost clearness . His first utterance was cryptic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once that he should not seek a meaning in the sentence . He shouted . The next words had significance : " Take one of the Dillons if you can . Michael or Mark . Either one . " By this he meant that Abel had inherited the Mara and was to provide himself with a first officer known to Stephen . He whispered : " Captain Abel . " Abel made no answer . Stephen muttered : " Take good care of her . " These words excited Abel strangely . He tried to stir Stephen by a blow . He shouted : " Mara ? Mara ? " His brother gave the barest hint of a smile , a ghastly twitching of his smeared mouth . He meant : " No ! not the Mara . Not that one . " He wished to pronounce the name of Laura Bannon . Here , however , he  | either fell asleep , on the strength of the gull 's blood , or he lost his senses . Abel took off his oilskin jacket and laid it over Stephen 's face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and crawled back to a thwart . There he lay sprawled for a few minutes . He seemed to be enjoying himself . In fact , the sun had become pleasantly strong . The ice on the lee gunwale had melted . The westerly swell had pulled down the seas . The wind blew fair for the dory . He rested . He put up the mast and , after resting another hour , he set the little sail . He stared at the compass . The reading of it required considerable time . He steered the dory onto the course with an oar and sailed swiftly toward the land . He sailed all the afternoon . Nothing much happened . Often he slept . The color of his face changed to its usual coppery hue because the sun drove out the purple blotches made by cold . He had to fight off sleep , yet he could n't help dozing now and then . During one of these periods , a dory appeared a mile to the northward under sail . Its course seemed aimless . At times the sail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It had been made in Lunenberg and had more sheer to it than the Yankee craft . A burden of ice kept it riding deep . Flashes of light spun off its sides and gunwales . It had been long since a doryman knocked off her ice . Abel 's dory ran by so closely that the turning bow of the drifter lightly touched his leeward gunwale . Had he been awake , he could have looked down into it quite easily ; and there , under the black ice , frozen thick from bow to thwarts , he might have seen the contentment of the dead . Abel awoke , not in time to see the dory , but in time to see Stephen heave up an arm . Abel lashed the sheet to the thole pins and went forward . He took the oilskin jacket off Stephen and looked at him . Abel had been losing management of his eyes ; however , he seemed to be satisfied that his brother was better off than he had been . His sleep rattled in his nostrils , and had certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abel leaned down and held his cheek close to the breath . He nodded sagely . It was rather pleasant in the bow . There the wind could not enter . Full rays of the sun fell there , so strongly that the ice did n't make in the shelter . Neither was it melting . Abel lay down by his brother 's side for half an hour . He slept most of that time . He rose again , put the dory back on her course , and drove away from the coming night . He sailed into the sunset , a heartening sight for him because of the clear light it cast from point to point , thus foretelling a fair night and a sailing day tomorrow .  | He slept no more . At the going down of the sun , he began the task of keeping off the cold . He lifted his legs and stretched them . He struck out with his free hand and beat his thighs . At regular intervals he left his place , crawled forward , and tried to bring Stephen out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sat up and languidly tossed his arms about . Once he stood up , his eyes closed , and began stumbling aft to take his place at the oars . He did n't speak . Abel let him go . When he fell , Abel dragged him back into the bow . Night came on . The half-moon rose and cast light scantily over the sea . The face of the moon beamed ; when the sky became black , the moon glowed . The westerly swell had lengthened . Now the light , coldly glancing off the moon , glanced along the swell and made a saffron moonglade . Down this he sailed , his dory adorned by spikes of gold , and his sail a cloth of silver . Stars came out and burned blue in the black . Abel sought the Pole Star , mumbled some words to it , and steered on . Lesser stars came out in the West . All of these shone clearly and all , save one , were delicately hued by emerald light , as if the bonny forests yonder were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these beamers was not a star . It was a light , flashing at short intervals . It had the hue of a candle flame . This difference escaped Abel 's eye because it required a gaze too fine and steady for him to make . He could n't keep his head up that long . Nevertheless , he seemed disturbed by that changing light , at times . He squinted in that direction and mumbled . His failure to make something of it angered him . He brushed his sleeve against the frozen lather of his mouth . He tried the words again . At last , he said them . " I should like to know ! " And , more passionately : " You ! You ! " The first sentence had been uttered in a calm fashion ; the words that followed expressed yearning , tenderness . They were said in a sighing way . Vapor swept the horizon from north to west . All the stars vanished . At once , a moaning began in the region where the light had flashed . A terrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down , like a man moaning in anguish of frost , and thinned to a crescendo , a prolonged Walpurgis syllable , fit to summon the condemned . Once again , Abel 's senses failed him . He believed this moan came from Stephen 's mouth . He made his way forward and heaved him to his feet . Stephen fell and groaned . Ice crackled in the folds of his oilskins . Abel struck him gently on the face and heavily on shoulders and thighs . Stephen groaned . He flung up his hands . Abel seized them and worked them back and forth . He dragged him down to the forward  | thwart and turned him over , so that he crouched on hands and knees . He kicked him on the behind . This started Stephen crawling forward . He had life in him and some heat . He had wit enough to seek his shelter . This pleased Abel . He grunted . Standing over his brother , he again heard the moaning of the Sable Island sirens . He could see that Stephen struggled in silence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the steering oar . Soon after the vapor had gone away , the signals in the west ceased . The stars shone again . The wind stayed fair for him . Once more , he slept , or seemed to sleep . Slouched against the oar , one arm crooked around the handle , he plied his trade . In long , unbroken rollings , the swell lifted him into the company of stars , then drew him down into blackness . So he sailed until moon-set , until rise of morning star , which came in peaceful glory , harbinger of blue , peaceful days . All other stars were dimmed by the vermilion whirl of the day star , yet far down ; only the morning star increased in beauty : great Venus ! borrowing before all others the sun fire , casting it aloft and abroad and to the westward , whither he must go . He witnessed the change and understood . Awkwardly and in pain , he twisted his body toward her , stared under lowered lids . He beheld her : the single heavenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black . He gave her a nod . He held up his compass and caught her rays therein . Her beauty gave him new life ; because the revelation of the needle made him howl . Harshly he howled and Stephen answered by a moan . Abel shouted to the sky , his slobbered face distorted in all that beauty , and befouling it . " On the flower ! " Yet ' t was nothing . He had steered north a space . Not long . His excitement could hardly be real . No , it was a shrewdness by his inner self , provoking a sound thought , an appeal to his seamanship , which , in turn , should cause a bold , affirmative action . Grumbling , he trimmed her , shifted his oar , and laid her on the old course . He examined the compass again . " Ah ! " A vessel of some sort appeared directly north of the dory . She could not be made out at all ; that is , her hull and masts were out of sight , either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She gave off a constant and icy flashing . Now there were a thousand glints and gleams on the ocean there . All of these had the unsubstantial quality of tiderips and spray . A man would n't give them much of his attention . That constant flash had more to it , a depth which proved that it came  | off wood . Moreover , it advanced , and in one direction : northwest . Had Abel stayed on his mistaken course , he might have steered to leeward of the stranger , and thus missed her . As it was , both of them were steering on courses that might bring them close to each other . The sun came up and flung a shower of mild light across the world . This served to change the quality of the stranger 's flashing ; indeed , the glare came so brightly that it seemed like signals off a glass to Abel . A long flash , a short one , two long ones . What then ? An inquiry ? Do you require assistance ? What vessel is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't the stranger 's story . A feeble glance , which was all that Abel had to give , might have been thus deceived . The flashes were meaningless , when watched for even a minute ; except for this one fact , now certain : that a craft lay there and on a course directed by human hands . Whose hands ? Hard to say , at that remove . The space between the two craft lessened at a rate that was barely perceptible . The sunlight lost its mild quality and made the sea glitter . These changes brought the image of the stranger up out of the common display . The icy character of her signals did not change . The only new knowledge given by the change was this : the craft yonder was small . Furthermore , it became plain that-ice had been making on her for a long time , and had not been beaten off . This was true also of the single sail she carried . What had happened under the Pole Star in the night past ? A mystery , soon to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little to the southward . To this , Abel made the necessary response . He pulled on the sheet . He did so in languidness , but with fair understanding . He also shifted his steering-oar . This gave his dory the greater speed , since the other vessel made no change . Soon it became clear that the craft might not meet , unless one or the other altered course . Their present courses should leave them on parallel lines . By noontime , or thereabouts , this became their relative positions . Abel had not lifted his head . He had only the strength to look at the compass infrequently , and to steer . For this reason , he sailed several miles without looking around , a duty which he should have carried out under any other circumstances . Either by mischance or by a calculation that had no reason , he again changed his course to the northward , so that by mid-afternoon he lay directly ahead of the stranger . She was yet so far away that only this much more could be made out : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Abel could steer no longer . Twice the steering-oar had slipped out of his crooked arm . His hand lacked the strength to keep  | hold . He made no remarks on this score , although his heart spilled out a measure of scorn for himself through half-shut , gleaming eyes . He took in the oar and let it fall to the bottom boards . The slight pull exerted on his arm by that action proved too much for him . He tumbled down . He was apparently so far gone that he had forgotten how he might shelter himself by lying down . He did so now ; and there found less pain . He also got some good out of the sun . He lay crumpled in the wash , his twisted , bloodied face turned toward the light . A bead of blood on his cheek melted and became a stain . He breathed only in gasps . Now and then his tongue came out over his teeth . It was black and swollen . When he opened his eyes , only the whites of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they rolled crazily . Even so , he gave a sign that his heart stayed resolute , that he had not surrendered , and would not . From time to time , his lips closed into a firm line over his teeth and he breathed through his nostrils . Also , at times , his right hand lifted and came down feebly on his breast , as if he were repeating in his darkened brain : " I will ! I will ! " Since he had lashed the sheet insecurely , his sail blew up , cracked , and bagged . Abel rose . He laid hold of the lee gunwale , bent his legs under him , and drew himself to his knees . He crawled aft in a sideways fashion and , at last , turned wholly aft . It was then that he saw the other dory following him . At once , in a certain degree of madness , he became cunning . He drew down and gazed slyly over the stern . He bared his teeth and growled . What mockery could this be , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ? A fear of pursuit , perhaps . Or a fear of the mirage . It did n't last long . He forced his legs under him , stood up , and opened his mouth . He filled his lungs . The cold choked him . He breathed deep again . This time he loosed a scream , terrible in its beastliness . Stephen moaned . Abel struggled aft a few more inches , no doubt seeking to come even that much nearer to his rescuer . He held one hand to his mouth and , once again , that same frightful scream rang over the sea . He coughed in his agony and bent forward . He stared with full-open eyes at the stranger . A man stood upright in the lee of mast and sail . His right hand was lifted . This could not be in acknowledgment of Abel 's cry . No , he lay too far away for that . He was near enough , however , to hear another sound , and , if he wished , to return the signal . A conchhorn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The horn  | lay there , its mouth full of water . Abel fell in his haste and groaned woefully , again and again , until he had seized the horn . He shook it . He could n't wait until he regained his first position . On his knees , he rammed the mouthpiece between his lips and blew a single note . He cried out in rage against his weakness . For the first time in all the six days and nights of his desire , the tears started from his eyes . Tears of a baffled soul . He blew again . This time he succeeded . A round , full chord sped upward , outward , and bowled across the sea . Stephen stirred and cried out . Abel answered him . " A sail ! A sail ! Steve ! Steve ! " Afire with sunlight , gleaming like a crystal shallop out of a legend of magic Avalon , the strange dory sailed on . Blithely the fair wind blew upon her crystal sail ; and at her silvered bow the waves parted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against her mast showed his signaling hand , which pointed to Abel . Abel blew again , and so mastered the horn that it uttered the ancient appeal clearly and sweetly : " I am lost ! Where are you ? I am afraid ! " His own dory tarried . Her sail lifted in the wind and slatted . He stood upright and shouted : " Ahoy the dory ! Come along ! Come along ! Starving ! Starving ! Have you food ? Water ? " A wasteful labor there . His voice could n't carry that far . He blew the horn , blew in ease ; for the approach of the stranger , sailing so smoothly and in such comradely intentness , filled him with the strength long stored by a brave heart . Soundly he blew : " Come alongside ! Ahoy , you fair wonder ! Come alongside ! " The man in the far dory did not alter his assuring posture . He neither shouted nor looked down to speak to his dorymate , whose head , barely lifted above the gunwale , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he held to his task and did it well , not moving , not crying out . Abel blew the horn briefly , then flung the horn down . He struck frost and spray out of his eyes , shielded them with his hands . The sun baffled him . He shifted in his place and peered again . Now his joy made him laugh . He struck his hands together and laughed aloud ; because , in the surge of sensibility created by hope , he had made out the character of the approaching dorymen . It had long been plain that the dory was a Lunenberg boat . Now he saw that the men in it were Negroes . He turned toward Stephen and said : " Cornwallis ' men . " This in a voice almost casual .  | Stephen gave no answer . Abel shouted : " Ahoy Calypso dory ! Ahoy ! Abel Delahanty ! Abel Delahanty ! The Mara ! The Mara ! Come alongside ! Alongside ! Water ? Water ? " His joy spewed over his teeth in a rush of lather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was time that they should . Abel crouched in the stern-sheets . Half-lidded again in wane of senses and wax of cunning , his eyes sought a sign to keep his hope strong . Quite carefully , as if he knew he had been close to madness and death , he looked at the men who dumbly stared at him . Their faces gleamed like beautiful masks of ebony ; and out of the masks their eyes of crystal gleamed . Abel crouched lower , seeming now to be possessed by fear . Fear of these , his old companions , joiner in many a bout of laughter . Onward they came , drawing nigh unerringly and with tinkling song . Yet never a word did they utter . Nor did their rapt gazes alter . Abel screamed . He heaved himself upward . His hands grappled with the frosty air . Froth bubbled at his mouth . He fell . And , as he fell moaning , the Calypso dory came up and struck against the stern of Abel 's dory . This was not a strong blow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his place . Knee-deep in ice and snow , he tottered . Bands of ice , started by the sun , fell from his frozen face . His frozen arm unchanged , he dived into the sea . Stiffly , stiffly . In falling , Abel had touched the tangled sheet . It may have been , indeed , that he had reached for it , in the last convulsion of horror , with the intention of hauling . In any event , the boom came in and the sail filled . When it began to draw , the dory started on its way , and thus continued through the afternoon until the dunes of Sable Island rose out of the sea . Here , in the shoal water , the westerly swell waned . Hitherto , wind and swell had taken the dory westward without much deviation from the course first laid down . Now the dory passed into tiderips and cross-currents , ever-changing in the ever-shifting sands . Once the dory ran eastward rapidly when the wind fell off ; and it seemed that it might pass into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never tell what awaited there . Where , in the morning , his lead told him ten fathoms , in the evening he might find three . There were , indeed , many small channels where the dory could sail and , in time , might run onto little bars that would hold her until surf overwhelmed wood . However , the wind freshened in time and the dory passed northward of the bar , and then began an erratic  | passage westward along the smoother shore of East Point . Once again , the easterly fell off considerably . The sail did not draw . The dory turned slowly round and round , touched by many forces , mastered by none . Abel slept . This side of death , he dreamed and grinned . The sun set in the same way it had set several days before ; that is , a cloud mass piled up between sea and sky . This shut off the flood of rosy light that filled the west . A portion of night came before its time and turned the sea into a black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by fountains . In that pool , the dory swam . After a while , the red rays pierced the cloud bank and , as before , the rosecolored flood sluiced over the upper sky . There it turned downward and cast a rose shadow over the scanty measure of land . Bleak as it had been , the island became a thing of beauty ; and more so when , a moment later , the lower rays flowed under the cloud bank and transformed the black pool into an amber sea . At the same time , a vagrant squall made an opening about half-way up the cloud bank . Through this round gap , a powerful ray , orange-hued , came like a searchlight . It fell directly on the dory , turned it into a sort of vast and unimaginable jewel , cast up from the treasure houses below . This display held without change for a long while ; then , as the sun fell closer to the rim of the world , the colors grew in brilliance and took on the hue of coals . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ island . There followed a new display , especially along the higher land between the shores . White rifts of sand , dry and brittle in the frost , sparkled like tinsel , like precious things made of colored glass . Seeing this , a man might well believe the gales had uncovered chests of jewels and bejeweled hilts , cast there when the galleons burst in the age past . Above the little hills , whose contours showed like breasts and thighs of dark giantesses yearning , the East Point light glowed , flashed , and glowed . In its outward sweep , the light regularly struck upon the Mara herself . The Mara ! Aye ! she lay at anchor in the shelter of the bar , where she had gone in the endless cunning of her search for her missing men . A light shone at her masthead ; the ruby of her port lamp beamed , sank into spray , beamed again . She seemed peaceful . Serenely she swayed , again the conqueror of March . Frayed , beaten , the poorer by much gear and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dory , full of men carrying her torches , came away from her side and leaped toward the island .  | The fury of sunset waned . The upper flood vanished . That opening half-way up the cloud bank winked like a red eye and closed . Night came on unhindered . It poured in from the east and from the west also , pierced there only by the West Point light . Yet the rose shadow lingered in a puzzling way at one space of land : a glade between two mounds of sand . The earth itself seemed to be alive and shimmering . Indeed , there were living creatures there . Gleaming eyeballs by the hundreds rolled and sent up glints and flashes . Above the uproar of surf and breakers beyond , there came a medley of minor noises , a windy neighing . The glade seemed to move ; a surf of many-colored sand blew outward . Living creatures were then revealed against the sky , against the springing lines of foam , and trampling the dark giantesses . These were the wild horses of Sable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cantering foals , the greatest of them not twelve hands in stature . Shrilly the stallions whistled ; the mares called in grieving accents . These were the horses of the sea . Cast up in a wreck long , long ago , the sires and dams of Europe had made their way through shoal and surf to the grassless dunes of Sable . They found her no nourisher of horses , yet the tribe had survived the salty centuries . Eaters of cod and crabs and sea weeds , sippers of salt water and snow and hail , the hardiest had lived and now throve when winters were mild and summers fruitful of grasses , sparse at the best . Some had been broken and tamed by the Canadian coast guardsmen , who rode them on their rounds . Most of them lived thus , wheeling among the dunes . Neither the night nor the fury in the skies had caused this tumult among the horses . Of such comings and goings , they had no fear . No , not even the gales of winter and the Northern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them bound in terror and call out their fears . A fire did this to them . The fire burned to leeward of a mound , which sheltered it against surf and squalls . A man off the Mara had piled driftwood there , had lighted it and left logs and ships ' timbers crackling . Its light had been dimmed by the rainbow hurtling in the skies , by the criss-cross play of gleam and glint on surf and sand . Now the darkness seized all else , all other hues , and dyed the sea . Only the firelight stayed ; and these flames blew in various strengths of green and red and violet because of the sea salts burning in them . Within the circle of firelight were some bundles of Mara gear : rolled blankets , water jars , a kettle set on a bed of coals , and two bottles . These last shot out beams of scarlet light .  | Farther away , there lay some debris of the first centuries of Les Sables : a horse 's skull , tipped in a flow of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the skull of a man . This relic of Europe 's hunger for cod had been recently disturbed ; that is , it had been lifted out of its grave , which could be seen : a hole in the snowy earth . The action of removal had apparently been one of respect ; for the skull now rested evenly on a flattened space . More than that , the skull faced the fire . Its black sockets stared into that living beauty , did so with the serenity that the adventurer himself must have displayed when he made his own fire there . No doubt , this Yorick had been a tall and hefty Breton . The skull was long and broad , the jaws well-formed with room for strong teeth . The teeth were gone . Had he slain the mare for her milk and flesh ? Or had she slain him , given him the old quietus with hooves of sanded horn ? Something of this sort the ascending moon had shone upon long , long ago . And now  --  quiet , quiet . Empty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and do know . All meaning lost except this : that even now , our forewanderer of the Grand Banks had been the object of a passing act of love . A man , to whom the dignity of our human spirit meant much , had tarried here , saying : Old-timer , how did it go with you ? Enjoy the fire , chum , and I 'll be back . A toppling wind chanced into the crown and made the skull whisper , made it chant . Away , away from this heat and fountaining sparks , the stallions led their clans . Teeth bared , eyes in fury rolling , they reared amidst shadows , and trumpeted their orders . Bewildered mares trotted after the upflung tails . Fawn-hued colts whimpered and strove on dainty legs . The horses swerved into the darkness and poured pell-mell along the hillside , seeking an escape westward . There another fiery object stopped them : fire and a Mara man . Far down the beach he hurried , a lantern swaying to his stride . Now and then , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gazed into the combers . His oilskins gave off rays of gold . At times , he ran knee-deep into the surf , holding his lantern high , and gazed into the pool where the dory whirled unseen . Once , after such a dash , he strode back onto the shore and there ran clumsily forward . A fathom-long object lay in the sands . Sea-slime and sea-weed had been strewn upon it . Hastily he struck slime and weed aside . He had found a log . He strode on . The horses stepped cautiously after him , seeking their answer to his mystery . When he had trudged a mile , the first of the stallions , a roan bounder , uttered a signal and turned into a glade . The herd followed him . The moon , which was filling up ,  | lay on the horizon , her nimbus in splendor glowing . Toward their familiar , the wild horses pranced . In drawing the Atlantic to her cold iron , the moon also drew the dory . She ceased to whirl , and held steady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and infinitesmal powers strove with the wood . The wind could not fill her sail because it lay bagged . Against her high sides , the wind did strike , yet not so forcefully that the tidal impulse failed . She required only a little to sway her to sea again or to shore ; and this little came out of the moon 's deep store . So very little , indeed , that a fanciful man might think the moon had sought out the tiny needle of the compass and now pulled upon it . The dory glided shoreward . A breaker bent beneath her and carried her out of the sea . There the surf took her , swung her sideways , and violently cast her onto the rippled sand . The long journey had ended . How , then , did the earth make itself known to Abel ? and how recall him ? By the new uproar of surf , by the sound of earth struck hard blows , by the cessation of deathly action , to and fro . By these , a final summons came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looms of stone . He stirred . He cried out grievously and raised his right hand , let it fall , raised it again ; and moaned in his spray-arched cave . A sea struck the dory , turned it halfway over . The conch-horn swam out and shone in moonlight . Abel sprawled on the tilted sideboards . His eyes opened . He witnessed the rising of the moon , and saw , beneath her beaming splendor the shape of earth , the earth , as ever , in the form of mother . His right hand struck the earth . Aye ! he clung to it fondly , embraced her with understanding and return of strength , as in our myth of Giant and Earth . He did not leave off gazing at the moon . She fed him . Her mildness nourished him . His eyes opened wider and wider . He flung his left arm upward and over . This action caused him to roll out of the dory . He raised himself to knees and hands . When he again lifted his head , he saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Fire ! " He began to crawl toward the flames . Breakers pursued him , covered him in foam , washed the sand out from under him , and left him on his belly . He resisted . He crawled forward , waiting at times for his strength to match his hope . He passed beyond the reach of waves and came to the dry . There he lingered in joy . He laid his cheek on the sand and mumbled his devotions . He crawled again and made his way up the rise of land until the fire and its radiant glade lay before him .  | " You ! You ! " This , an endearment . To whom addressed ? Hard to say . Moon or Earth ; or to a child of either , an image flickering in the whirligig of his brain , maelstrom of his spirit , where all images trooped in a Limbo dance ; and one , may be , with flying locks , masked , lusting eyes , breasts extended in rare excitement , whirling naked and supreme to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a one ? Laura ? Oh , no search there . None at all . " You ! You ! " He pressed his purple lips to the dry earth and ate it . He groaned and plunged onward , raising his hands smartly in a prancing movement , like a father playing with his red-haired , laughing son . The flames enthralled him . He opened his mouth and brayed . This certainly seemed a mad action ; even to him it seemed so . He shuddered . In fact , the world lay reeling from him , and apt to leave him in a madness made by salt . Aye ! he had drunk it . He fought , conquered . He lay quiet , serenely regarding the fire , and licked his lips . He spat and , suddenly returned to that attitude of cunning , which accurately revealed his nearness to death , he greeted another image and said to it in a childish rote , and in the true , Yankee jardin-de-ma-tante style : " Comment trouvez-vous ces Iles ? Et ces houles ? " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " and : " Oh , ho ! " A delirium made by brine : brine in his belly , brine in his soul . To which , the delirium of rum is a light comedy . Nevertheless , his soul in its shrewdness joined battle , fought like an angel in the darkness , sought out among the trooping images that one which might yet compel a noble action , a blow for old humanity . An image tarried . Abel changed . He greeted it . He swaggered on his yielding hands . He bent back his head , bared his teeth and shouted . " Jump , you punk ! Below with you ! " He had acted another 's part . His voice had become another 's . His face had taken on an unmanly anger , strange to him . Yet this venture helped him in his search of himself . He breathed pleasantly . He raised himself to his knees , flung up his hands and then , in an astonishing play of his warming muscles , he stood up . This triumph delighted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distant earth ; and , for the second time , he cried a little . Tears of wonder , shed in delight , in joy . He stepped forward . It was then that the beloved image presented itself , that image he had audaciously sought amidst the throngs of childhood , the throngs of manhood . He turned . He went in short , delicate steps back to the dory and laid hands on Stephen .  | Far down the shore , the Mara 's lantern glowed . Beyond , the round ? ing light ; above , the moon a-glow . Abel laid hands on Stephen . He rolled him out of the dory . He tried to lift him . This he could not do . He took hold of Stephen 's right arm with both his hands and bent backward . Stephen sank into the slough . Abel stepped over him and knelt between him and the sea . He placed one hand on Stephen 's thigh , the other on his shoulder . He heaved . Stephen did n't yield . Abel lowered his head and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abel repeated this action again and again , grunting at the task , calling to Stephen . The labor revived Abel , broke his numbness , gave his heart a chance . He toiled without rest up the slope to the glade and on toward the fire . At the end of an hour , the things of earth that had given him life had their way with Stephen and enlivened him . He spoke a meaningless syllable or two . He cried out in his anguish of frost . He even tried to crawl . At first , he failed ; then succeeded . He turned toward the sea . Abel guided him toward the fire . Again , Abel stood up . Leaving Stephen to follow , Abel stumbled nearer to the fire . Twenty feet away , he paused and held out his hands . Thus he judged the heat of that mass of coals and logs . He had his wits about him for that passing moment , and showed clearly that he knew the danger of too great a warmth for a frostbit man . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His shoulders widened ; his head went up . He became tall again . He faced the moon . Water ran from his sou'wester . He flung it down . Water trickled out of the folds of his oil clothing . He tried to unfasten the trousers . He had not the skill for this intricacy . Once he turned his head and looked at the sea whence he had come . No curl of lip for a triumph ; no such smile graced his wan mouth . His look did not say : " I have cheated you , our sea ! " Nor : " I fear you , but can not hate you , bitter one ! " The fallacy lay beyond his heart . He knew well enough the character of his triumph . ' T was a triumph over himself . Abel conqueror , Abel conquered . No , his expression had another meaning : he wished to size things up , wished to know on what earth he stood . Ordinarily , such a seaman would not have hesitated long . He did now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its intervals as best he could . He swayed . Stephen 's shoulders came to rest against his boot . Abel pursued his calculation . He asked aloud : " Cape Negro ? Hey ? " This gave extraordinary evidence of his condition ; and revealed strength and weakness . Broadly speaking , he had been on a course for  | that Nova Scotian light . He did well to remember that much . On the other hand , Cape Negro lay over a hundred miles to the westward . A voyage not to be made , even in a dream . He pondered . He lowered his gaze . This change brought his eyes directly to the water jar , the bottle of rum , the tea kettle , and to the other gear . His gaze passed over these things without seeing them . Certainly his eyes gathered up the images  --  Mara images that should have shaken him with final joy  --  yet such images could not be admitted to his darkened mind . Even the fire did not have its obvious meaning . He did not ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Light ? " When he had first asked the question , his tone had been one of plain speculation . The repetition came from his lips in a wistful way ; yes , in the old mournful and yearning eagerness for an answer . He shuddered . He twisted his head and gazed at the eastern light . This addition of one light to another proved to be a sum that he could do . His head drooped . His whole body shook . He whispered sadly . " Sable Island ! " Now he stood assailed by the knowledge that , after all , he had not escaped death of hunger and death of thirst . This knowledge toppled him . He fell by Stephen 's side . His right hand came to rest on Stephen 's cheek . There he lay a time , until the fire called to him . A timber burst into green flame . The warmth flowed over him , into him . And , as ever before , he roused his heart for the sake of the man next to him . He stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the skull , seized it and staggered away . The forthrightness of this action showed that an excellent idea had come to him . He lost hold of the idea at once . He fumbled the bone . He looked in lively curiosity at the crown and sockets , even turned the face toward the fire so that he might examine it in ease . And he did so quite calmly , as if he himself were a hale adventurer with a bold interest in a man who had come to a wilderness before him and had failed . As his liveliness again increased , he struck that half-humorous attitude which seems irresistible to certain men under such circumstances . Being so intimate with a thing that causes terror to common hearts , they muse ; and are moved to speech that is close to wit , yet respectful . In fact , Abel did arrange his legs in a graceful attitude  --  one boot forward  --  and seemed , for the merest part of time , to be in pursuit again of another image . The buskin pose , perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage . He brought the relic somewhat nearer and turned the sockets toward his own eyes ,  | which were now not much more than sockets . On the very point of speech , which should have been priceless if it matched the enigma of his smile , his grace became corrupt , and he croaked one word . Skull spoke to skull . " Water ! " And skull replied : " Water ? Quel dommage ! There is none on this isle , Companion . There was none for me ! " Abel fell to his knees . In the last outlay , he wielded the skull in furious sweeps until he had scooped a shallow grave . He rolled his brother into it , covered him with hot sand , leaving only his face open to the setting moon . This done , he set the skull down in a respectful movement , and laid himself between Stephen and the sea . Trudging now up the dune that lay between fire and sea , the searcher off the Mara came , his lantern a firefly , waning in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other stride , he turned to scan the breakers yet once more . The darkness had become so thick beyond the surf at the setting of the moon that even best-skilled eyes must be baffled . Nevertheless , he halted on the height and peered . There he raised his lantern and blew out its flame . The moon descended beyond his stand . At the last , her round of light threw him into bold relief and he seemed bowed , a man brooding in defeat . He gazed into the east , where the day star should soon rise above the Mara 's topmasts . He came down then to his fire and set his lantern in the sand . He threw driftwood onto the embers and took his stand by it , his face fully lighted in the glow . The face ? Yes , the same one , seen many a time before , so strained in vigilance when Stephen steered the Mara and Abel stood by his side . ' T is Seth . The new woe had made no change in that face ; could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before , in the days and nights when he had guarded them and yearned to die for them and thus settle his account with that divine man gone , his eyes had held a constant light . Thus his eyes had spoken for him ; had said those words his tongue could not utter . Words of love . He now stood without that light . His eyes were empty and shed the firelight dully . Otherwise , a whole man . Whatever labor he had endured aboard the Mara in her conflict with the gale , he had borne well . He displayed much vigor in his actions , such as the striking of his bare hands together in the ways of thought . It was plain that he had now taken up the problem of gale , tides , and time . He nodded his head in agreement and said aloud : " Aye ! " Again ,  | he held up his left hand and counted off the fingers : one , two , three , four , five , and back to the thumb again . Six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and searched . In the end , had set him ashore to search . His sombre look of speculation changed into one of grief . The line of his clean-shaven lips broke . His lower lip protruded and curiously altered his stern aspect . A pout . He seemed like a child , bereft of a dear thing . It was over . If Seth 's love for Stephen and Abel had caused him to put too high an estimate on their abilities , his own wisdom and his own ability as a seaman now proved his beatitude lost forever . He stepped forward to pass beyond the fire . This movement carried him closer to the levelled place where he had laid the skull . Perhaps , even in his fresh grief , his absolute grief , he had remembered an honor due the ancient man . He cried out and leaned forward . He looked down and saw the furrowed sand , the marks of dragging boots , the prints of groping , victorious hands . He turned . Thus he found them , wrapped in Sable 's sands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , skull to skull with the wild mare 's skull .  | 10 MICHAEL , MY BROTHER , had made three trips as captain of the Medea before Stephen Delahanty jumped to the Mara 's deck again . Our voyages did n't amount to much . We broke even , I should say . Michael did well enough , considering his youth and the absence of certain elders who could no longer bear the hardships of the Banks . We took bait at Yarmouth on all the voyages . The first trip was made on Emerald Bank , and we hailed for fifty thousand pounds of mixed fish . The second trip came to nothing because of poor luck on Western Bank , where much gear parted on a bottom that had never given trouble before . None of us could make out the reason for this loss . On the third or fourth set , I remember , eight trawls were hung up . We were using only ten dories . All but two failed . No conjecture satisfied us . Neither force nor cunning might free our gear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down below . My own trawl seemed to be fouled in a hundred places . When the schooner sailed up to my signal , Michael himself came into my dory to size up things . I should say that he had been well-schooled in this part of our trade , because a captain must be sure that his men have tried all devices before crying goodbye to gear . Michael hauled gently and hauled strongly . He gave the job a frowning hour and , at last , said no more could be done . I asked him for his opinion . He said : " You 're hung up on a new wreck , Mark . It feels like that to me . " I had something of the sort in mind . But what of the other trawls ? Were there so many vessels lately strewn below ? I had no word of such  | a destruction . My own opinion had been that the submarine earthquake of the winter past had wrought vast changes in our pastures . An upheaval of rock by the commotion might have caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Michael had enough on his mind . Just the same , I think I had struck on the right answer . Strange tales were passing amongst us ; from schooner to schooner , mouth to mouth . A tidal wave had run across the world on the night of that earthquake . A village in Fortune Bay had been destroyed and all the old men and women had died . The Newfoundlanders said that the weather had become milder there and big cod were being caught close to shore . All of the tales , in the end , became roomy speculations on the Gulf Stream . According to some seamen , the earthquake had tumbled things of the sea  --  shoals , gullies , and banks  --  all the way from Cape Ann to the Labrador . This had the worst possible meaning for us , if it were all true , because the cod flourishes best on the shoreward edge of the Stream . As a matter of fact , all of the campaigns failed that spring . This failure forced certain of the captains to strike out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Banks that brought on the change in the fisheries . There had been an upheaval ' longshore , too . The world of cities and money had run down . The machine had rusted unbeknownst to its mechanics . It needed oil . Which is to say : money . People were poor . Even at sea , a man could hear that surly world muttering at night , groaning in sleep and out of sleep , staring at dead walls and repeating : " I must eat ! I must eat ! " All mankind may share in such dreams and yet be unaware of the direction of the dream . But if a man stays at sea a while and comes ashore , the change is plain to him . When the Medea sailed into Boston harbor with sixty thousand pounds of fish , we found that we had failed , just the same . The fish could n't be sold . True , there were some hundreds of thousand hungry under the old roofs of the slums and in the lanes beyond the roofs . Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the money to make it worth while for the merchants . We took our fish back to Gloucester and let them go to the factories . Yes , some of our fat cod went into the mills to be made into fertilizer to grow food that could n't be sold because the fishermen did n't have any money . And now what ? Ah , there was always a way out for the daring man . If the poor could n't keep the Medea in grub , then the rich must do so . A delicacy can always be sold , no matter how hard the times may be . Cakes are baked , even during a revolution . That is why Michael  | turned to us , after we had tied up at the old Bannon wharf , and said : We 'll go tomorrow . Rigged for halibut . " " Halibut ! " " That 's the story , Mark . They 're eating that junk from the Pacific . We 'll sell her right through at forty cents . " The dorymen , who had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sides of their heads , and began to grin . Michael vaulted to the springpiece and stood on the wharf , stretching his arms in the sun . I ca n't help saying : what a man ! He turned his yellow head sideways toward us and winked . Thus he displayed his audacity . Why ! the money was as good as in the bank . The dorymen began to laugh and some of them sat down right then and there to their hooksets . I heard Michael exclaim . A word that I could n't make out . He did n't speak in dismay . No , he had spied something that gave him pleasure . Before I could reach his side , I heard him speak aloud . This time I heard his words clearly because a measure of silence had suddenly come upon the dorymen and captains who had been watching us come ashore . A signal , not seen by me , had passed amongst them . One of the Bannons ( a cousin of Laura ) , who had been striding toward Michael with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the head of the wharf . All ashore turned that way in such a oneness of expectation that a man could n't help thinking it was like a play and these players had heard a cue far off . In this silence , Michael had spoken . " Here they are ! " Stephen and Abel had appeared at the head of the wharf . I could n't tell how they had arrived at that particular spot ; that is , whether they had come out of the Bannon office on the right-hand side of the lane or had come around from the next wharf . Whatever the way , there they stood , close together , and they were silent , unmoving , and just barely smiling . In the short issue of time before good manners broke the silence , I took in wholly the image of the Delahantys . Michael groaned at my side ; and I groaned inwardly . They were white as angels . Aye ! even their hands shone pale . I do not say that this pallor would have made a landsman turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were they pale . I ca n't say that I ever laid eyes on a handsomer pair of men , barring the off color . " Handsome , " I suppose , is really a way of saying spectacular . Yes , there was something of the sort in their appearance . We were all accustomed to their way of dressing . It was n't what you would  | call smart . Or fashionable . Like Michael himself , they carefully kept behind the times , according to the usage of young Gloucester captains who went regularly to the same Boston tailor on School Street . The tailor 's taste had been inherited from his grandfather , who , in turn , had his taste formed by our grandfathers , the dandies of the fleet . That tailor had done considerable work for the Delahantys in the weeks past . He had done it well . Stephen wore his grey , Abel his blue . There was nothing wrong , or extraordinary , in this perfection of attire . No , the troubling thing was Stephen himself . He had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had been carried off the Mara to the ambulance . " Is he all right ? " I said " Yes ! " at once , because Stephen had taken a step forward to greet Sebastian Bannon , captain of the Wild Rose . I marked the oldtime vigor of his stride and of his outstretched hand . More , I heard in all that distance his voice crying : " Sebastian ! Say , chum , how does it go ? " And good laughter , this I also heard with my usual pleasure in such things . In his eagerness , Captain Bannon thrust out his left hand to Abel so that he might keep his clasp with Stephen a little longer . Abel had done better than Stephen . Yes , these were almost exactly the words that Michael said . " Blue 's better off than Steve . " Just the same , Abel had n't made the whole gain . He had more flesh on him and he gave off more light ; indeed , so much more than Stephen that I at once surmised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Abel had had the better of it . A curious thing  --  this new quality in their bearing . When they were children ( that is , boys of eight and nine ) , they had been so alike that they were often taken for twins . Indeed , Grandfather Dillon had sometimes pretended that this was so . A prank . By the time they had first gone to sea , this resemblance had waned . They were easily told apart . Again , in those first dory years , they had drawn together again . This is partly explained by the fact that all dorymen take on the one cast : hands and shoulders become large , sun and wind paint the same colors on every face , and the labor , on deck and in dory , tends to make one pattern of manhood . That is why these two had found it useful to carry on the childhood custom of blue for one and grey for the other . And now , at this high noon in Gloucester , we saw that the sufferings of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . At this point , I should say that , at the time , neither Michael nor I  | knew anything about that passage . Nothing more than the sentence : " Six days in a dory ! " , a fact dreadful enough in itself and made more so by the solemn looks and quick bends of the head that went with its repetition through the fleet and on the coasts . There was n't much more than this sentence , because Stephen and Abel had not been allowed to speak for many days . By the time they could speak lucidly , they had been taken away from Gloucester . They now came sauntering down the wharf , stopping quite often to grasp hands and to answer briefly to inquiries about their health . They seemed to be loitering ; to be quite without an aim . However , the shrewd observer could see two things : that they were seeking somebody , and that they did n't wish this to be known . Just the same , the other captains and dorymen knew it . They did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be said , sooner or later . No , they kept passing Abel and Stephen along without hindrance , despite their plain joy at laying eyes on them again . Nothing uncommon took place until the two came to the rail of the Daniel Webster , a Bannon schooner . Her skipper , Patrick Bannon , had been working in the cabin . Someone had given him the news . He came up . Before he jumped over the rail , he threw up his hand in welcome , called out their names , and then asked a question of Abel . " Where 've you been , chum ? " I heard this , but I could n't hear Abel 's answer , which consisted of one word . I did see a new laughter pry up the corners of Abel 's mouth . Whatever the word had been , it gave no pleasure to Stephen , whose swift change of expression lasted just long enough for me to say to myself : " Now what 's he scowling about ? " Captain Bannon shook their hands and they passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the real chums ! I knew perfectly well , at that moment , that they had waited at home until the Medea had emptied her pens , and they had come down only when her topmasts had moved in among the others . This intention of theirs had been known to the other dorymen , who had wished to see our meeting because our old and separate companionship in the days of our young ambitions had made us four the objects of a particular esteem . It was a fatherly sort of affection for children who had no fathers , for young cousins who had been obliged to take on manhood at too early a date , and for reasons which solemnly appealed to hearts so learned in sorrow . Thus were we left alone , our eyes satisfying a great need and our hearts speaking without words and without reserve .  | In the end , Michael said : " Welcome home , Steve ! Welcome home , Abel ! Mark and I  --  we were sorry to hear about the trouble yonder " ? he sent a glance seaward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said : " How are you feeling , Steve ? " " I feel all right , Mark . We did n't lose anything " ? he held up his pale right hand ? " no fingers or toes , I mean . Close to it at the last , I hear . " " I have a scar on my rump , " said Abel , " from the frost which is just the shape of the letter A , ' and that 's a very handy thing for us in case we 're ever caught in our birthday suits . " He bolted these words out almost triumphantly while he shook our hands and added : " How frost got in there and not into this " ? here he held up his pale right hand ? " I do n't know . " Stephen kept his eyes fixed on Michael 's face . He did this deliberately until Michael was forced to meet the gaze and let his own eyes make their report . I am unable to say directly the nature of this report . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to make under the same circumstances a moment later : dismay . Yes , the Sable Island passage had wrought an unhappy change in Stephen 's face , which had always been calm and beautiful . His forehead had not changed , of course . Neither in breadth or in depth could it change . Only between the eyebrows a channel had been carved by thought and by remembrance . In those parts of his face where flesh had been full and could vanish and tauten the skin , the flesh had gone and the skin had tightened . Thus his nose had become beaklike and his cheeks had become gaunt . His mouth had always been red and well-shaped . Now the lips habitually lay in a dry crease . These losses and changes , so small in themselves , had various effects . His forehead seemed to have enlarged . An illusion . In turn , this made his eyes seem deeper in the skull . Observing this face , and doing so amidst genial recollections of its earlier hues and contours , a man needed no great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Never again the jovial thawing here . What can the course be now , chum ? " In a tone next to lifelessness , Stephen said : " You find me changed , do n't you , Mark ? " " Yes , Steve , you have changed . Or were changed , I should say . " " For the worse ? " " Not exactly . " " I suppose , " said Michael with a wry twist for me , " that Mark means  | you 've not put on what you lost . But that will come . After all , it is n't such a long time since . April , May , and June , and part of this . " Stephen repeated the names of the empty months and then said : " No , Michael , I 'll never be the same again . It is n't to be expected . " This , too , he said in the lifeless tone , which , in the next instant , changed to a better one when he looked at Abel and remarked with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from him with such emphasis that I understood he wished our thought to take another turn . Indeed , both Michael and I had already changed , because the freshness of Abel 's behavior had surprised us . Having in mind Captain Bannon 's question , and my curiosity being excited , I repeated the question I had heard the captain ask . " Where did you take your rest , Abel ? Were you two together ? " It was Stephen who gave the answer . " No ! They kept me on my back at Captain Pollard 's place in Virginia . Abel  --  well ! I 'll be damned if the doctors did n't order him a sea voyage . A hair of the dog that bit him , Michael . He went to Ireland again and then  --  then to Paris . " " Paris ! " " Aye , Paris ! " Abel began to laugh . His face flushed swiftly and his eyes began to give out more of that odd sparkle that I had observed in him before . At first , his intonation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abruptly , the light went out . He stopped his laughter . An image ? Yes , an image  --  or the lack of one . Michael began a laughing sentence . I had never been in France . Michael had been to Paris some years since . That was during the season when the Medea and the Mara raced to Ireland with our fathers at the helms . I had been aboard the Medea . My father would not permit me to go out of Ireland . Because of this ruling , Abel had been kept in Galway , too , while our brothers made the grand tour . Their tales were clear enough in memory for me to understand that Abel 's freshness had been due to a similar gaiety in The City of Light . There he had good food , good wines , and , if all went well , he had been with Laura there . I came up to the matter with some diffidence , not wishing ( for my own reasons ) to betray too lively an interest as I had done before to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abel ? " Eyes downcast in the way of shyness , he kept back his answer a space and then gave me it in a voice so rich in its tone and so deep that I actually felt a curious thrill , just as if I had been with him in the  | vaults of pain and , still at his side , had passed into serenity and health again . " Like ? ' No , Mark ! I love the French . I always have and I always will . " He paused on the last two words in a graceful , almost breathless way , and then repeated them : " Always will ! " Certainly he realized that he must be delicate here . Not because of me . I did n't give a damn for the French , one way or the other , and merely wished we might be let alone by them . He said : " Of course , I speak of the people of France . Our kind . The workmen , the artists . Nurses . Doctors . People like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then lifted his hands , opened them with a gesture that was downright French in character and said in a louder tone : " Our comrades ! In the great age to come ! " Whether or not Michael had discerned my inner purpose , he certainly perceived now that I had become confused . He calmly asked the question which I had hoped to introduce more subtly , unless it came up in a common way . " Tell me , Abel , did you see Laura Bannon in Paris ? And is her work any better ? " I turned my eyes down in a loitering style and pretended that the question had only an idle meaning to me . Even Abel 's answer failed to stir me to betrayal under Michael 's gaze , should it chance to search my eyes . " I saw her . Did n't speak to her there . No . " This brought up my eyes ; and I was again startled by his expression : first , the gay curving of his mouth , which he had shown to Captain Bannon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once succeeding , an expression even more disturbing than the scowl I had caught on Stephen 's face at that earlier moment . Yes ! A mild joy or melancholy  --  I could n't tell which ! An image ? No doubt about it this time . I became instantly and savagely overcome by a desire to make him say one word more . My heart hurt me in its work . I 'd have given anything to be able to say calmly : " You saw her . But did n't you speak to her ? In a city so far away , chum ? Is n't it a strange story to tell us , after all ? " Abel nodded his head up and down in thoughtfulness . The sombre light had dwindled ; he had become serene again . Of course , he was in no danger . He knew that he stood among men and not amongst pryers . Whatever shapes waxed and waned in his memory , none of us would inquire , openly or subtly .  | I gave up . Stephen regarded this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required . Of course , he had heard it before . No doubt , in Quebec Port where he had gone to meet Abel , who had returned on a French passenger vessel . Michael repeated part of his question . " Were you able to find out ? is her work going all right ? " " Yes ! They say she will amount to something one of these days . I was able to do that much . I found out easily enough . " He became fully free again and spoke with wonderful animation . " She has n't forgotten us . Not at all ! You 'd never guess what she painted for some exhibit or other . In a gallery near a university . I ca n't say the name well . And won a prize . " Stephen said : " Michael can guess . Michael knows . " " I do ? I know ? " " Think ! " " Abel himself ? " suggested Michael , but in such a joking fashion that we knew it to be a device to gain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obvious , Michael . Come now ! You must remember . " " Ah ! the Black Dory ! " " Right ! " Abel cracked his delicate hands together . " Le Doris Funebre . That 's the name she had under it . Oh , a good piece of work ! Even to me , it was . Three colors , that 's all . Black , white and a darkish red . A darkish red for the ghosts , Mark , and one rowing against the gale , the other blowing his conch . Take my word for it ! it will give you the creeps ! " " Me ? Give me ? " " Aye ! " Here again his voice took on that faint triumphantness . " ' T was all I took from Paris . I bought it . " And then : " For three thousand of their francs . " He added this because the franc had always been a mystery or a joke to us . Stephen said : " He bought a painting . Good . But I 'm as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turkey in Faneuil Hall Market and it should be done in an hour or so . You two are to come to dinner . We 'll make a night of it . We have the wine . This one here " ? he took Abel fondly by the arm ? " is going to make absinthe drinks for us . Pours it through lumps of sugar , he does . We 'll be higher than kites . Stay the night . " To this , Michael answered : " Yes ! " and he turned with Stephen for the walk up the wharf , in which we were stopped now and then by newcomers who wished to greet the Delahantys . There were others ,  | especially captains and owners , who were anxious for opinions from Michael concerning prospects at sea . By his usual skill amongst men , he drew Stephen into such talk . Stephen 's opinion had once been valued as much as any other ; now , and for the time being , they were not inclined to burden him with our troubles . After all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long shot . Michael kept the secret of his decision to rig for halibut . This was a custom in the fisheries ; moreover , the Medea stood in need of secrecy . One vessel might triumph . Or two . Should the whole fleet join in such an enterprise , and succeed , the story would have been the same as the cod story : too much halibut , too low a price . Another thing : there was n't , at the time , another crew able and willing to make the long voyage , even to the Green Banks or the Grand itself . Fish must be killed near at hand . That was their opinion . ' T was a poor time . Two vessels were offered for sale that day . I forget their names . " You 're not going to tie up and lay here ? " Michael shook his head at this question from Stephen . " No ! " " What are you going to do ? " " If you ca n't guess , chum , I sha n't tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because ' t would show you 've slipped . And I do n't think you have , Steve . " Stephen bent his head a little . A rosy color ran up into his cheeks . He then looked at Abel in a pleased way . He said no more , but led us past the Anchor House and down to the Delahanty wharf . The Mara lay there . She was in great shape : fresh paint , a set of new dories , and much work done by the riggers . They had overhauled her and had gone off without leaving a curl behind them . A number of dorymen were at work on her deck . Seth sat amongst them , his hands deftly turning a gangin-board . I watched the dorymen and at once I saw that they were rigging for halibut . You can tell this , because of the distance between hooks on the trawl . ' T is a fathom apart for cod ; that is , according to the Greeks , a spreading out of arms , which gave six feet of breadth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough space for cod to feed in and knock about when steel is taken . For halibut , a mightier fish in breadth and spirit , three more feet between hooks are due , and more pounds to the line . Seeing this preparation , I laughed , and said something rather witty about great minds on the same courses .  | Stephen did n't listen . Nor did Abel . They were staring at the Mara . I do not say that they saw her . I glanced sideways at Michael . Again I perceived so clearly how far ahead of me he always steered ; for his solemnity told me what I might have known : that neither Stephen nor Abel had set foot or eye on the Mara since the day she had taken them home , and they still in peril of death . What was all her beauty to them now ? Tell me he who knows . Look at two faces narrowed by grief and fortitude , at eyes brooding in pale skulls , and in both pairs of eyes the eternal conflict of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fear and hatred , sorrow and the splendor of old bravery . Thus a man may learn ( in my case , then , too late ) that a thing 's beauty may be at war with its own usefulness . Her topmasts gleaming white , her beautiful sail , furled and crotched , her pens that made sweet curves : all these joined in the appeal . Yet what had she done to those men who sought to press her beauty and her usefulness to the last full measure ? She had slain one and had nearly slain these others . Aye ! the truth of her came on like the blinding light and I saw in that flash how all this beauty must one day perish as , indeed , it has in my own time . Even then , in fisheries far away , this had become known to men and they were shaping a new vessel to displace her and her kind . A machine that would hew down topmasts and mainmast , too ; that would destroy her beauty lest her usefulness vanish quite away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreheads laced by the shadows of her shrouds ? Hard to say . A man might think that there was not room in their hearts for such speculation . A wiser man might have at least come nearer to this truth : something stood between these two and their Mara . They were new men , made new by affliction . They had changed . Now , out of the bowed rank on her deck , one man rose and , laying down his box of Norway hooks , crossed the deck to come nearer to us . Lightly he struck his blackened hands together to rid them of dust . He leaned upon her rail and looked up . Ah , the eyes ! the eyes ! " Here , " I said , " is Seth . " At this , they listened . Their heads came up a little and their eyes ventured into those depths , gleaming below the wharf . Thus the savior and the saved met again . And not one word could they utter . He turned away , crossed the deck , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We 're rigging for halibut , too . "  | Stephen turned his back to the Mara and led us away , saying : " You 'll be ready tomorrow , wo n't you ? " " Ready now , I think . " " We 'll race you to Nova Scotia for a dozen bottles of wine . Winner 's choice . " " You 're on ! " " But , " said Stephen , " you must lend us a sailing-master . We 've not got our legs back yet , have we , Abel ? " " I 'm a greenhorn . I 'll not race without Mark to handle sail . " Abel took me by the arm . " Hey , Mark ? You 'll do it , chum ? You know her qualities well enough . What say ? " I nodded . " O. K. ! I 'll sail against him , " said Michael , " but who 'll take the winnings ? ' Twill be a Dillon either way . Not that yon sweet bitch has a chance against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head and , for the first time that day , he let out a real blast of laughter . " Why ! you slob ! did you mean to drink that wine alone ? " " Alone ? Alone ? Who said anything about drinking alone ? What an idea ! To drink alone . I was thinking of Kathleen . She likes ? " " Oh , to hell with Kathleen ! Come on ! Come on ! " Michael and I walked to our home . We washed and put on our ' longshore clothes and drove the open car over to the Delahanty cottage , that old one on the shore which had been left to them by Grandmother Dillon . By this time , I had given up all pretense of inner well-being . No doubt , I became morose or , at least , seemed sullen . There were enough practical reasons for such a mood , so that I had no concern with Michael 's thought of me . My preoccupation seemed agreeable to him . Indeed , he stayed deep in thoughts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that usually broke any such extended silence on my path . " A penny for them , Mark . " " Cheap at half the price . I was thinking ' t is far to go on a chance of halibut . The Aurora found none there last time . " Michael gave me the sixth and sourest part of a smile , which meant : " The Medea is not the Aurora and I am not Captain Billings . " My words had been half a lie . I had that thought , of course , and a score of others on the matter of our venture . It was not the thought he wished to drag up . No . He supposed that something was turning over inside me . I kept it from him .  | I muttered on the last stone step . Thunder pealed far at sea , rolled shoreward and waned in the breakers ' thunder . Michael , his hand raised to the knocker , said to me in a low voice : " I 've been thinking . That Laura of  --  of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ugly as she is . In Paris , beauty does n't count for much . A woman 's known as a female . Or as nothing . She had it in her . " " Who ? What ? What 's that you say ? " " Do n't try to kid me , chum . " He lifted the knocker and let it fall . " Surely you saw the look on his face when he said he saw her but did n't speak to her ? " " Saw her ? Did n't speak to her ? Why ! that 's right , too ! " He banged the knocker . " What the hell 's the matter with Steve ? " And : " We can respect a man 's silence on such matters . ' T is his affair . That does n't mean we are to pretend we are damn fools . Among ourselves . Let us pretend nothing ! Never ! Well , watch your step . These lads are strangers to us yet a while . " The door opened . The housekeeper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the house , where Abel and Stephen were at a table . They were laughing over a contraption that Abel had set up : four glasses , each topped by a strainer which held a lump of sugar . Out of a greenish bottle that bore a foreign stamp , Abel was delicately pouring drops of a pale liquor . He kept repeating a French phrase in such a droll manner that Stephen could greet us only with a wave of his hand in the midst of laughter . Abel said : " He does n't believe it can be any good . " " Well , " said Stephen , " you ca n't deny they go to a hell of a lot of trouble to get a jag on . " " It 's poison , " said Michael . " I saw it in a picture once . It 'll ruin your manhood . Take enough of it and it will . " " Everything good is poison , Michael , " Abel looked up from a melting lump with a curious flare of gaiety in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poison . " I could see that this notion startled Michael . Rather , its source did . The remark seemed to me , at first , a quick bit of hollowness without much meaning , except that it was a new style for our chum . I saw him whisper an afterthought to himself . He poured water through the strainers , stirred the drink , and lifted his glass . I lifted mine . What an odd fragrance it had ! Not strong , yet quick to run into the heart , like a woman 's chosen fragrance when it has gone half the night . Over the rim , Abel said : " Medea and Mara  --  here 's luck to them ! "  | We answered the health and sipped . The drink ran into my mouth like a lively wash of herbs . Impossible to believe that it could make a man drunk or do him other harm . Stephen and Michael rebelled . Each took a sip , gagged over it , and put away their glasses with impolite grimaces and gestures . And Michael @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Irish ! " To Stephen : " Is Mr. Jameson in the house ? " " He is , indeed ! " said Stephen . " In a wonderful state of preservation . " " Show him in ! Show him in ! " Stephen poured the Irish whiskey and they drank quickly with looks of manly scorn for the sipping children . Ours was a prim sort of intoxication , I must say . A leisurely spiraling , in the beginning , and then a change that soothed and excited at the same time , making the music of rain a green , sleepy pleasure . And in it there were hints of possibilities which , oddly enough , were matched with a languidness . So much the drink did for me , and as much for Abel . Perhaps more . He cared nothing for their refusal . He laughed and kept saying such things as : " Good , eh ? " and " You would n't believe it , would you ? The taste it has and what it does to you ? " When he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phonograph and said : " It 's about this  --  this drink . Listen ! " ' I listened . I could n't understand much of it , but the voice  --  a woman 's  --  required no such understanding . A lament , half sung , half recited , passing from hoarseness to mellowness , and back again . Brief song , brief refrain , a complaint between . An invitation to the dusk , to darkness . I drank . I emptied the tall glass and waited upon the drink . Deep in the pearliness of my glass  --  aye ! forty fathom down  --  I saw Laura whirling in a dance , her arms and fingers stiffly outheld . Luminous figurine . I gazed languidly and with no desire for her nakedness . No , none at all . Round her piled robe she whirled , her head bent backwards in the angle of aspiration . She worshipped . Music in a barbaric scale . She became two , became six . Six figurines advanced , paused in a half turn so that their robes parted in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set of shines and gleams . Philadelphia Mulligan began a chant beyond the yellow wall among the flute players , warbling in the Lydian mode . A figurine of a bull , golden-horned and well-hung , pranced in melodious steps down the descending ray . He bowed his head . A Lydian panther sprang from an ambush of wisteria and slew the bull in one stroke . A conch-horn laughed and jeered . Mr. Davis ,  | splendidly draped in a long himation , made a sign to the orchestra . The music ran to a chilling rage , then played in passion a dirge for the slain Python . I cried out and flung the javelin . This pierced her . Nevertheless , she danced toward me , holding her ivory hand under a breast newly swollen . I drank her down . Mischief stirred in Abel 's eyes . " Good , eh ? Any effect on your manhood , Mark ? " The door opened and we went to the table . Stephen carved the Faneuil Hall turkey , slicing thin in the dark meat , thicker in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Mara and to the Medea . Fair winds , fair winds . We ate , drank , laughed , and , in the end , drank coffee . In a while , we got up again and went back to the old room of long ago . There we sat , as many a time before in childhood and manhood , and began the graver business , the real business of our meeting . And this ? What was it ? Ah , the story of Sable Island . Aye ! this had to be told , not in the way of a triumphant recital or a celebration of life retained . No , it was shop talk . All that they had learned of dory , tide and gale had to be related for our sake and the sake of dorymen and of dorymen-to-be . In fact , we were properly as much concerned with the behavior of the dory as with anything else , because we knew that this had been the way of her creation . Those whom she had saved had strengthened her . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had heard all of the story up to the coming of the gale . We had also heard that part to be told only by Seth . Now Stephen , in a noticeable eagerness , began by confessing his anger in the forecastle and took the blame for all that had followed . All ? Yes , he could prove that out of his anger and his choice of action had flowed all evil . His eyes never stayed long on mine or Michael 's . True , he looked at us in the swift narrative . Yet it was to his brother that he chiefly appealed . Not for absolution , I should say . No , I had the strongest feeling that he wished to be condemned . I said to myself : " He is asking forgiveness . " Michael said : " Leave off , Steve . Who was hauling when the gale came on ? " He left off and forthrightly finished the story of the first days and nights , a tale in which he labored hard and , at times , showed sweat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lamplight . Once , having come to the words " I tried to bail , " he spoke in a convulsive rush , stopped , murmured and gave up . I solemnly witnessed the struggle of  | his consciousness . I saw that he wished to go on , yet he could not go on , because he knew no more . Abel took up the story , which became his entirely , for it had now come to that part where Stephen lay without mastery of himself . Michael remained the captain , faithful to his profession , even in the sorrow that beset his face . In coolness , he interrupted Abel from time to time , saying such things as : " You did n't know it was a light , eh ? Chum , you were far gone ! Far gone ! " Abel replied : " Not until later . Then I knew , Michael . " a ; Perhaps he took a cue ( a wrong one ) out of Michael 's calm . Or the newness in him led him to a keener image @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any event , he began in the ironic vein and spoke of luck . His recital , at this point , revealed a truth that interested me very much : that in this delirium of brine the memory functions . Which is to say that he actually made a record of unbelievable details in his memory and now poured them out . This was true also of Stephen . He would nod in agreement at the account of certain acts , although he himself testified that he had known nothing at the time . There may be a mistake there . ' T is possible . But let it go . " Then Steve called me and showed me the food he had hidden . One of the morsels I had put into his mouth . Even this he had saved , and it was sodden with salt and sweat . I ate . No , Mark , it was n't the food that held me up . Not so much that . It was my brother 's greatness . " " Ali ! " Michael struck the table in joy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one word I wished to hear from you , Abel . You also ! You proved yourself a better man than Dick Murphy . His five days to Canso ! Ha ! " " No , " said Abel . " Dick Murphy  --  he was alone . Did n't his dorymate die on the third night ? I had my brother . " Abel stayed silent a space . He then finished the story and Michael and I related to them the last part told by Seth ; for , in truth , this agony was more than they could speak of themselves . ' T was Seth who saved their toes and fingers by the brine bath and the long soaking in buckets of salt water to draw the frost out slowly . This had been done in the Mara 's cabin . My pity , and my desire to know the new man as I had known the old , became too strong . Excitement grew in me when I heard him repeat that ironic sentence in French : " Comment trouvez-vous ces Iles ? " I asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard such a phrase or if he had made it up from his schoolboy store .  | " I heard it pass between two French fishermen at Haulover Lock in the Bras d'Or Passage . When I was a boy . " I wanted to ask the meaning of his other exclamations , such as : You ! You ! " And also : " Can you now explain why you bit the earth ? Or kissed it ? " It was n't possible to ask these desirable questions . Abel himself sent out a signal that he wished to say no more of that part of his story . Michael , too , had at once perceived that I had touched the untouchable and must stop . He gave me a green look that sent me on at once to the thing that had filled me with wonder : his failure to understand the meaning of the bottles and the other gear , which seemed strange in a man who had understood the meaning of fire . " Meaning of fire ! " he shouted . He struck the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you this much , Mark Dillon : I was sure that it had been lighted by our father . And he long dead ! " " By our father 's spirit , he means , " said Stephen . I said : " And was n't it so done ? What else drove Seth to such a seamanlike calculation ? And to the building of the fire ? What is Seth , if he is not your father , Abel ? " " Aye ! that 's so ! " Michael spoke harshly to me . " Give it up , Mark . Until another time . " I did so . At that moment , Stephen said something under his breath and left the room . Abel looked after him with some anxiety . He , too , left his chair and took a stride toward the door . He hesitated there , muttered to himself , and went into the kitchen . Michael needed this interlude badly . In the keenest excitement , he bent over me and whispered : " A quarrel here ! Watch your step , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mara or ? " He turned to the sideboard and took up a glass . Stephen returned . Up until then ( except for the time immediately after our arrival ) we had passed the hours in a customary fashion . Tales like these had been spun there before , though none so sad ; and many a song had there been sung and the Book expounded while the sea chanted . Life and death had reigned therein , each in his mortal turn . Time . Time had swept the hearth clean and had come again on Christmas Eve to strew again such embers . Yet in this onwardness , no changes were seen . All should be , one day , as it had been before . Tick ! tock ! would do it . Ghosts must make room for dear wives and our own little ghosts stand aside for children fair as we had been . Thus , in a sweet customariness  | and in silence , Stephen and Abel , Michael and Mark , invoked the thronged past . And it was good and natural that out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our remembrance of things past , there should come , subtly , subtly , the tenderness of melancholy , which does harm to no heart . One chord passing into the chords of rain , chords of the sea under , all joining now to tell the tale of tomorrow . How true ? ' T is hard to say . For my brother and for me , all true . If it is right to believe that our fates are created by our consciousness , our personalities , then , for us , the years had only to ripen . Mellowness there must be . And for these others ? these two strangers , made strange by time and by a passage more terrible than all that had gone before ? Question : had they really survived ? Were they not , long since , gone from us ? Change ! What is meant by change ? The wisest of us , Michael , had said : " These lads are strangers to us yet a while . " Then how long , Captain Dillon ? Forever . Consider Stephen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a debt to pay . Neither the debt of his father nor the debt of Seth . Yet in his act of grace , in laying down his life for his brother , had he not prepared himself for an even nobler act ? I do not say that the higher grace had become inevitable . The idea of inevitability is hateful . What I mean to say is this : that , having once offered to give up life , Stephen now had the spiritual power to make that offer again . Indeed , he had become capable of giving up more than life . This is true : that the possession of such a power gives a moral rank to the man , a rank which is a burden . Always . For most men of our time and of times gone , the proof of this lies in god or saint . For Michael and for me the proof lay in man himself . When Stephen and Michael had gone to their rooms , I said to Abel : " You 'll show me that painting now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face . With a curious and pleasing gracefulness , he lifted his right hand in a gesture toward the door of the room which I usually occupied during my visits . I stood up and  --  hard to believe ! ? a sort of unsteadiness dropped over me , a near sickness . Yes , a ridiculous image seized my heart and mind : Walk the plank ! Also , I felt disdained , a feeling against which my comradeship fought valiantly . I walked slowly to the door , pushed it open , and entered the room . Two lamps were burning there , one at the head of the low couchbed , another in about the middle of the room . He had arranged a display . Set evenly on a chair , between the lights , I saw the painting of the Black Dory . Its beauty lifted me into a joyful mood , one without  | fear . As I have said , we were somewhat accustomed to such experiences . Long ago , art had once been held before us as a not impossible goal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we had heard wise men and women say : " There 's no reason why Abel should not achieve something great in music . " And : " Stephen has a genius for mathematics . He should go far . " And : " Let Mark sing once more for the people at Boston . That voice should not be left to spoil . " All these , and other talents amongst us , had failed or had been kept down . The painter of this picture had not failed . What they had said of Laura , she had forced to come true . I stepped back a pace . Not by infinite detail or by mere representation of our Atlantic myth had she accomplished her wonder . No , by few strokes and by power in them she had set the Black Dory in the midst of the salty wilderness . Forever climbing up the climbing wave . Black the dory , red the gale , white the fury . Beyond the gale , the schooner jogged at spectre speed ; and yet did not appear . Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reefed sail or a bare topmast in the scud . The heart knew that she lay beyond , unhearing . And those faces above the tipping gunwale ? Ah , the same story : old humanity ! Except that these were ghosts , not men . Yearning , nevertheless . Yearning for heaven . Each face turned outward in a beseechment to the beholder . Faces formed of fog and wreathed in it . One man leaned backward in the pull of oars ; his dorymate held a shining conch-horn to his lips . This horn had substance ; it was not ghostly . No , a solid shape of shell and ornament , curving grandly in the ghost 's hands and toward the centre of the picture . It was The Philadelphia 's horn , his treasure . I rejoiced in the fervor of her memory , a memory that did not fail even in the twist of his silver letters  --  here a gleam , a single stroke . " Do you see ? " " I see the horn , Abel . " " Ah ! not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I stepped back a space . He said : " No , that wo n't do it . Kneel down . Get level with it . " I knelt on one knee . Thus my striving eyes encountered the painted eyes . An encounter I could not bear ! Because the eyes of the rowing man were the eyes of Abel , and the eyes of his dorymate  --  yes ! these were my own . Glaring over the horn . You might suppose that a man could accept such a thing in calmness and that he 'd do no such thing as groan , almost in horror . What  | was the story ? Why , a foretaste of bitterness . That was it . Had these two on the canvas been whole men , blood romping in hardy flesh , there could have been only pleasant wonder at such skill and such kindly remembrance . But to make ghosts of us ! A ghost of Abel and a ghost of Mark . I said to myself : " Here 's the diabolical . Yet I 'll not seek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the meaning  --  a meaning  --  showed itself . Were n't we killed by prophecy or by wish ? And consigned , not to the comforts of hell , but to this frozen Limbo ? I kept the shudder down , held it in my backbone and belly . Nevertheless , the spasm tightened my lips , made my nostrils draw up the air . Abel said : " Do n't take on so , Mark . " I stood up and replied : " That 's going some . I 'm damned if it is n't . " He had been clearly dismayed by the success of her frightful art , her trickery . ' T was more than he had bargained for , no doubt . He had said it would give me the creeps ; and had n't gone too far in choosing our childish word . He was in error if he thought I had concern for myself . I had none . And why should I ? A painting or a prophecy could not make a ghost of a man , could not separate me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the hurt for me , if it was that , lay in the hurt of Abel ; this seemed , really , to be my chief concern . It was too pat ! I wondered , then , how this parable had been conceived in her imagination , which had always been a mad one . Had she , perhaps , read the story of his Sable Island passage ? It might have been so . The whole world had known of it . However the stir came to her , I was angry at the thought of Abel living with such a remembrance of pain . It would do him no good . I took some comfort from the thought that even this portrayal could hardly match the ever hidden content of his memory . He stared in a dull fashion at me . He seemed so far gone in tiredness that I said at once : " Goodnight , Abel . " I sat down on the chair next to the bed . He said : " No ! Wait ! I 'll put this away first . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He returned and stood before me and said : " Have you anything to say to me , Mark ? Anything to ask ? " " Yes ! But you may be very sure I sha n't ask . I do n't place myself in circumstances where anybody can say no ' to me . " " That 's bad . " " Bad or not  --  it 's my resolve , Abel . "  | He said : " You know I brought something else from France , do n't you ? " " I had such an idea . " " It 's for you , Mark . I 'll give it to you . " He took out a blue envelope and placed it in my hand . I glanced at it . There was no name written on it . I asked : " What 's this ? " " Mark , it 's the answer to your letters . Those written on the Banks and written here . You 've had no other answer , have you , Mark ? " " None ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I heard him sigh . This was so unusual that I looked up at him and I saw such a sad expression that my unfriendly resolution waned . He was thinking of me . I said : " Is she ever coming home , Abel ? " He replied : " She is home . She 's at work here . In the old house . Has been for weeks now . " He came closer and laid his hand on my shoulder . " Will you go to see her ? Before we sail . Go tonight " " No . " " I did n't want to talk too much about her while the others were around . " " I noticed that . You made a mystery of it . " " I did n't mean to , Mark . I just did n't want Mike or Steve to know what 's going on . What went on , rather . " " Well , what 's the story ? Am I to know ? " He nodded . " I said I did n't talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it was a trick on my part . I saw her , but I did n't speak to her then , Mark . " " How did you manage that ? I mean  --  why did you do it , Abel ? " " Figure it out , Mark . I really wanted to go there . The doctor found that out . In my fever , I guess . So he sent me . Well , there I was  --  a sick doryman . Nothing more . And there she was . Changed . A winner . She was at the top . Everybody knew her . She had made the grade . Believe me , Mark , I was astonished by what I heard . I lost my nerve . What little I had . So I just cleared out of Paris . After I bought the picture . " " But you saw her just the same , did n't you , Abel ? Somewhere else ? " " Yes . I went to the fishing ports . To Finisterre . And others . To take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nets . These are the vessels they designed for the North Sea . She came there . We were together for a long time . " He looked at me in a sudden shyness . It was almost  | childlike and made me think of him as a boy . " I was very happy , Mark . " I said : " I 'm glad to hear it , Abel . " And I was glad that , after all he had gone through , he had been happy , even for a little while . With all my heart , I wished him to be happy forever . He said : " I came home . She came home later . She means to work here now . To do at home what she accomplished there . Mark , she will tell our story . Because it has n't been told . In all these centuries . " I said she could do it . I said I hoped she would do it and that she would be happy at home . " And you , Abel ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed me . Something in me just passed away . I 'm through . This is my last trip on the Mara . I 'm coming home and she 'll meet me when we tie up . Then  --  we 'll clear out . Laura and I. " I had to wait a while . I then said : " Off the Mara ? Forever ? " He struck his pale hands together . " Aye ! Forever ! I 've had enough of death and pain and suffering . Not for myself alone . But for all men . Mark , the dory has to go ! The hooks and trawls have to go . There 's a change coming . A good change . And I 'm going to bring it to our chums . Dragging a net is safe and clean and easier . It 's decent work . Not brutal . I 'm going back to France and to England . To learn the job and bring the gear home . It 's my duty . " I said nothing . After a while , I lifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blue envelope . I waited some time before I could open it , although I knew well enough what it must contain . I took out a folded sheet of blue paper . All the space of it was filled with seven lines of strange verse done in strokes of a black brush . These I read Under the grapevine root Where the mole sleeps And night crawler climbs Under the tendrilled roots Where wine rain seeps O my Greek ! my Greek ! my Greek ! Buried the half-coin keeps . This was her farewell to me.  | 11 TWENTY NIGHTS LATER , the Medea lay on the northern edge of St. Pierre Bank and sixty thousand pounds of halibut in her pens . In her time , she had had her triumphs and had done her sailing . Nothing like this . Nothing . She had won the race to Yarmouth against the Mara , had taken bait , had gone to sea in her company and had left her in a squall , the last of rough weather for that voyage . Between Green Bank and St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ halibut in four days and nights of wonderful toil ; and had gone northward on the fifth night , according to the legends of our old charts , where the fish had struck in before our trawls were well down in seventy fathoms of water . Not all our pens were full . We might have taken forty thousand more , but our judgment came to this : that it was better to be in Boston before the Mara , we being sure that she , too , had found fish and would be turning homeward soon . We had not seen her during the fishing . A salt boat for Newfoundland said she had hailed the Mara to the eastward and that she seemed to be killing fish in plenty . Hope ran high in our hearts . All that we wanted in the way of weather came to us . There had n't been much wind during the fishing . There had been enough for clever men to sail by and for the Medea to jog . And yet , at the very moment that Michael asked for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long , she had all her pretty muslin opened , even to topsails , and she sped along ; the new moon , descending , gave her a moonglade down which she sailed until moonset and plunged on into the darkness , her lee rail under . All night long she sailed , without tack or reef , and all the morning after , neither hailing nor sighting another vessel .  | In the afternoon the bow watch came aft to the helm and reported a topsail steering to westward . An hour later , on going off watch , he came to the wheel again and said : " Mark , yonder is a Gloucester vessel . She 's changing her course to us . " He said this because Michael had passed the word that a sharp eye was to be kept for the Mara . He wished to speak her , if she appeared not too far out of our homeward course . Because he liked Stephen so much . I climbed into the shrouds to take a look at the vessel yonder . She was far away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; neither could I make out her course exactly . I went back to the wheel and let the watch go down without word for Michael . He slept the clock around . At nightfall he and I stood together at the wheel , talking of our hopes for the Boston market . At this time the cook came up and lighted our running lights . This had hardly been done before another port light began to rise and fall to windward of us . There was no danger . This was in darkness , except for the evening stars . By moonrise , it became clear that the strange vessel lay on our course and seemed to have no plan to leave it . She had come up close to us , then drove ahead at a remarkable speed . The first dull light off the moon fell on her sails . Michael asked : " What does she look like to you ? " I said I had no good opinion . The glow of the moon ceased ; she began to beam . She threw her light widely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea , which was nearly a flat , despite the easterly . There was n't a whitecap showing . I said : " ' T is the Mara , Michael . " " I think so . " At this the bow watch sang out . His voice , at first , had nothing much in it , for he had no other duty than to report the presence of the vessel . He kept his silence for a time , then raised a new cry : " The Mara ! The Mara ! " I heard the name passed along . A doryman , who had been standing near the break , passed along the name to us . I shouted : " Aye ! The Mara ! " I paid little heed to her for the time being , because I had my steering to do . Michael stepped to the windward sail so that he might be a little nearer to her . At that moment the moon passed into a cloud which shut off her light . When the moon came clear again , the light seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our bow watch where he leaned over the rail gazing at the Mara . I glanced at her . Suddenly she fell over onto the other tack and came rushing up  | to us ; and before the manoeuvre was well finished , I heard a wailing cry come from our bow watch . In the same breath , 1 heard Michael cry out in strong dismay . I looked at the Mara . In the moonlight , and in the new set of her sails , I could see her colors , which were not ordinarily flown . The colors were at half mast . One of our men shouted : " The Mara ! The Mara ! Colors half mast ! " The Mara came up so recklessly that I brought the wheel up a spoke . Michael made a trumpet out of his hands . " Ahoy , the Mara ! Who for ? Who for ? " Many voices answered . " For Abel ! Abel Delahanty ! " And : " Ahoy , the Medea ! Abel ! Abel ! " " Ahoy ! Ahoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Can you hear us ? Abel Delahanty lost ! Lost ! " From the lee of her jib , a deeper voice , sad and powerful , cried : " Murdered ! Murdered ! " And for the first time of many I then heard the hopeful , mysterious inquiry : " Ahoy the Medea ! You seen anything of Abel Delahanty ? " ' T is something to be left untold . I mean this chime of voices , these sad utterances mingled with the old , sweet music of sea and sails . And that last old questioning which seemed to us a form of madness . " You seen anything of Abel Delahanty ? " How could this be so ? Some man drunk with hope ? If one cried that the sea had closed over him , why ! he fed the salt , did he not ? And another , no less dreadful , declared that he so fed the salt because he had been murdered . Since these declarations were made to our ears , and neither qualified nor withdrawn , why did we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abel Delahanty ? " How could that be ? Was n't this an amazing sort of disbelief ? A rebel opinion among those presented to us in the moonlight ? What fantasy lay here ? Miles and miles of the sea had lain between the Medea and the Mara since this thing had happened , whatsoever it was , and yet the rebel standing in the darkness of her waist had spoken of loss and murder both . Michael fell back from the rail , turning his head only over to me , keeping his eyes and attention for the Mara . He had caught up the mysterious pattern at once . I could tell that , because his first word to me was : " Mark  --  you hear all that ? " " Aye ! " And then : " Abel ? "  | " Aye ! ' T is Abel gone ! " " And Seth . Seth , tool " " ' T is what they said . " He cried out then : " Heave her to ! " " All hands ! All hands ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men hauled . The Mara slid up to us at undiminished speed . I listened for the heave-to order aboard her . It did n't come . I called out in the stillness : " Ahoy the Mara ! Will you heave-to , please ? Captain Dillon wishes to speak to you . " She came on handsomely , her sails and deck burnished by the moonlight . I could not make out clearly her dorymen and her gear , and clearer now the flag of the Republic extended there to prepare men at sea and hearts ashore for the story she had to tell . I cried out : " Captain Delahanty ! Captain Dillon wishes to speak to the captain of the Mara ! Can you hear me there ? " A man replied : " We hear you ! " Michael shouted : " Will you heave to , please ? I want to come aboard . " I gave the order : " Number One Dory . Make it lively now . " Not until then did we hear Stephen 's voice and understand his intention . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small noises of his gear ; and he spoke formally , as if , indeed , we were strangers on some barbaric sea . He said : " That you , there , Captain Dillon ? " " Aye ! Steve ? " " Aye ! I ca n't heave to . I 've no time , Michael . No time , do you hear ? You speak any vessels in the day ? " " None ! " " You homeward bound ? " " Yes ! " " Speak those you can and ask ? " Here the ever-widening space between our vessels widened so far that his voice and its plea fell short of our ears and all I heard in the rattle of her passage was " Abel Delahanty " ? in syllables drawn out , mournful , and rising , at the end , to a question . The Mara fell into the other tack and sailed away . I looked after her and beyond her . Beyond her I saw the starboard light of a vessel on an eastward course . The Mara steered toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where we were to sell our fish , Michael called the crew and asked them if it would not be the wise thing to keep the secret of the Mara to ourselves . " For it is plain to all of us , " he said , " that this business is not so simple as it seems . We 've all seen men lost at sea , either out of dories or off the deck when they were caught unawares . But in this case there 's something more to it . Something not easily explained by us if once we set tongues clacking . I do n't think we 'll lose much by keeping a secret for a few days and we may gain a lot . If the story is true and Abel and Seth are really lost , we 'll be just as well off if we let the Mara tell her own story . But you can see that the story is not a common one . Somebody aboard that vessel used the word murdered ' and Mark here now believes that it was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who could ever think of raising a hand ' against Abel Delahanty , the gentlest of them all ? He never raised his voice in a curse or in abuse and , for all I know , he fought only once in his life against a man and that was for the sake of my brother here . Despite all this , here we have him gone , and Mark keeps saying : He feeds the salt ! Feeds the salt ! ' He is certain of Abel 's death , as most of you are . But as long as there is any doubt  --  and I have my doubts and wonder  --  is n't it better to say nothing of the Mara ? " There came no answer from the rank of dorymen . Either because they liked to hear him talk , or because they wished to see how he had reasoned it out , they kept their mouths closed . They gazed steadily at him . Michael went on : " Why should there be any doubt of it ? Nobody  | can deny that the Mara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't do that unless he was absolutely certain that one of his men had died . Yes , we may be sure of that . Either Seth or Abel is gone beyond all question . Yet it strikes me as strange  --  very strange , indeed ! ? that this same captain should be seeking word of his brother . " He flung up his hands in surprise , quite as if this thought had never occurred to him before . " Word of his brother ! Whom he loved as a brother and as an old dorymate . If Abel is dead , why should his brother seek him ? If Abel is murdered , who murdered him ? And how ? And why ? Why ? I suppose some of you have had the thought I myself have had : that the tough time our cousins had getting to Sable Island last winter may have hurt their minds . That 's a reasonable way to think , but I can assure you that both Abel and Steve were in good shape . Abel better  --  much better  --  than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time Abel steered the Mara into Yarmouth , and had his legs back ? why ! he was as good a man as ever he was . And you know what that means . The best ! A very capable seaman . And yet he 's gone ! Gone in such a way that one man cries out Murder ! ' and another  --  the captain ? asks us quite clearly if we 've seen any sign of him ! " He ended by saying : " I 've no right , as skipper of this vessel , to tell you what you should or not say . I 'll only tell you what I 'm going to do  --  and that is : keep what little I know to myself , until I know all . Until I hear Captain Delahanty speak for himself . And the murderer also . I want to hear him speak his piece . Either on the Mara 's deck or at a court of inquiry . " Thus closing , he went below without waiting for an answer , which was a proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men alone . If any of them had his doubts as to the wisdom of the proposed course , he now had his chance to say so . Like myself , the dorymen were satisfied with the way Michael had given his opinion . Moreover , we were , one and all , much influenced by the last few words : a court of inquiry . My dorymate , John Fleming , one of the oldest men aboard , came up to the wheel and said : " Mark , my boy , you can tell the captain that no word will be said by one of us , except that we spoke the Mara and expect her home any day . " I said I would give this word to Michael when I went below again . After another day of hard sailing , we came up to Cape Ann and passed on to Boston , where we gave the dealers a surprise . Michael  | went into the exchange at the Fish Pier and came out ten minutes later with a good bagful of money for our halibut . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pound , thus making good his theory that the epicures had yet a penny left in their pockets . It had been a shrewd campaign and there was many a bright and winking face on the deck when we cleared out and sailed for Gloucester , where we tied up as usual , this time to await the arrival of the Mara . Neither Michael nor I could go to sea again with that burden on our backs . Four days passed before word came from Boston that the Mara had hailed for thirty thousand pounds of halibut and had done quite as well as the Medea . This report came in the usual way ; that is , her arrival and her fare were listed in the Gloucester Times . Nothing was said about the loss of Abel and Seth . By this time , I had half convinced myself that a good thing had happened aboard the Mara in the days she lingered behind us on the Banks . Surely she had found both Abel and Seth . They were dorymates and , no doubt , had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a squall . To go this far in my thought , 1 had put aside the words shouted by Will O'Malley , which was a hard thing to do because Will O'Malley had always been a good man aboard a vessel . He was n't the one to pass such a word unless he had the best of reasons . Michael and I stayed aboard our vessel that night . We sent word to our mother that the Mara had been reported and that we wished to see Stephen . The Medea lay in her usual berth , so that we could make out the Mara as soon as she came into the harbor . About nine o'clock the rain began to fall so hard that we were n't able to make out much . Michael sat in the cabin and worked on his accounts . From time to time I went on deck . At ten o'clock I heard a man hailing us from the wharf . Before I could answer , we heard him jump down to our deck . I said : " Here he is ! It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his account books into the locker . He did n't say anything . His eyes had gone all black in excitement . I sang out : " Come down ! " The man above did n't answer . He left us without a sign for a space , then he pushed back the companionway slide and came down into the cabin . It was Will O'Malley . I needed only one look at him to know that he had nothing good to tell us . His gaze was steady enough , but the look he turned to Michael , and then to me , had no joy in it . No , only an appeal . An  | appeal for what ? A childlike plea for us to prove at once by magic that what he had seen had been only a dream . I said : " The Mara in ? " He shook his head . " How did you get here , Will ? " " I left her at Boston . I came down on the train . " He stumbled over his words a little . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . It 's on your deck . " Michael said : " You want a site aboard my vessel , Will ? " He nodded again . By these signs , used instead of words , it was plain that he did n't wish to talk , that he did n't trust his tongue . I said : " Captain Delahanty aboard his vessel ? " Once again he nodded . I asked myself : " If he is afraid to open his mouth , why did he come here ? " No doubt , the same thought had come to Michael . I was used to hiding my thoughts . Michael was n't . Indeed , I was surprised that he had waited so long without telling Will what those thoughts were . Yet he kept his silence . We stood there under the lamp , waiting for the doryman to make up his mind . It was a silence hard for him to bear . He kept changing his gaze from my face to Michael 's . In the end , he looked down at his boots . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were wet . His raincoat ran with water . When he bent his head , a splash of water fell from the brim of his hat . He whispered some words , which were lost in the pound of the rain on the skylight . I thought he had said them to himself and that possibly he had complained about getting wet . I could see his lips move . This time I caught just three words , the tail end of his sentences : " ... have written something . " By this time , his actions had become hard to bear . He certainly knew the strain we were under . As well as I , he could measure the depth of Michael 's sorrow and anxiety . What else could keep Michael from shouting at him and taking the story away from him ? In as low a tone as I could muster , I said to Will : " You have ? You 've written something for us ? " He murmured : " For you to keep . Yes . " He now dropped his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twitched . This annoyed him . He frowned and bit at his lip . He began to frighten me ; that is , I could n't help thinking of the death of Abel and I knew now that the circumstances of the deed must have been terrible , indeed , to turn such  | a man as Will O'Malley into a twitching silence . There was nothing better to do than to watch him in word and action . I said no more to him . I spoke to Michael . " Will has written out something for us to keep . Something about what happened on the Mara . " I waited a breath and added : " About Seth and Abel . " Michael said nothing . Although I had looked directly at him while I spoke , he did not take his eyes off that bowed head under the lamp . The sadness of Michael 's expression had increased beyond anything I had ever seen in him . By this , I knew that he had accepted the death of Abel as a fact , and that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his death would be a frightful revelation . Without raising his head , Will thrust his hand into an inside pocket of his raincoat . He took out a bundle wrapped in a hand towel . He walked past me and placed the bundle on the locker . For the briefest space , he stood there , gazing at the bundle ; he then turned and left the cabin without a word . I saw his face quite clearly when he passed under the lamp . It had no expression at all . His departure left Michael in a trance . Instead of turning at once to the bundle , wherein lay the answers to all our fears and questions , he fell into a musing pose , his fingers touching his jaw , his eyes rather empty of light . He stared at the place where Will O'Malley had stood . The drops and streaks of rainwater there took on a yellowish glow . He seemed more at peace now ; in fact , a rather wry smile had begun to work away from his mouth and into his cheek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and has accepted it . " I sat down in the locker and unwrapped the towel . A cardboard box lay in its folds . In the box I found seven sheets of notepaper , on which a story had been carefully scrawled in pencil . I said to Michael : " He has written an account of the  --  the thing that happened . I 'll read it to you . Is that all right ? " " Yes . Read it . " The story was as follows : Written aboard the Gloucester Schooner Mara on the eleventh day of July and days and nights following . Written by Mr. William Xavier O'Malley , doryman aboard said vessel . Done by him as a witness to all related herein , and sworn to by him as a true account . Written during the days of and nights of the search for Abel Dela-  | hanty , boastwain and purser aboard said schooner , and on the voyage home . This writing begun on the night we hailed and spoke the Schooner Medea , Captain Michael Dillon . Preface : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Captain Stephen Delahanty of the wilful and angry murder of his brother Abel . At four o'clock or thereabouts , in the morning of the eighth day of July , the schooner being on the eastern edge of St. Pierre Bank , a short set was ordered and made by the captain for the purpose of finding out whether the fish were there . This being established , and two thousand pounds of halibut being taken , a regular set was ordered and made at noon of that day , and ten thousand pounds of fish were taken and put down . This without trouble and with considerable enjoyment by all hands , on account of a just fear that nothing could be done in the way of killing halibut in those waters . I say without anything happening that is worthy of note , but I will and do make note of the fact that on this day and before this day there had been disputes , arguments , and angry words between Captain Delahanty and his brother . These the more noticeable because the vessel had always been particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never been known to lift his voice in anger or in any way dispute or attack the authority of his brother , the captain , until now . And now he appeared before my eyes as a moody man , and his brother a sullen man , and both , I will say , suffering duly from the rigors and pain of their being cast away on Sable Island , as all the world knows . To which rigor and pain I can and do bear witness , having been on watch when these two were saved on Sable Island by Seth Dolan , at one time my dorymate and afterward the dorymate and special friend of the late Abel Delahanty . Concerning the deep cause of these disputes between brother and brother I can not give the reason . All that I can in honesty say is that Abel Delahanty must have declared many times in secret parley with his brother that he would not continue his life aboard the vessel , and that they must part company after a lifetime of endeavor together in suchwise that they were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the helm , Captain Delahanty , standing apart from me with his brother , asked on one such occasion : " So it is this for which our father and his  | father before him worked and died ? And many another good man worked and died ? Is it for this that The Philadelphia ( the late Philadelphia Mulligan , captain of the Mara ) gave up his best years that you should stand there and declare you wish to go ? And where will you go with the money that she ( the Mara ) has earned for you , and what will you do with your two hands and who will take our vessel to sea when the time comes that I must lay off a trip ? " Thereupon , Abel Delahanty made this answer : " I wish to go , Steve , and you must let me go . My heart is n't here any more . " To which the captain cried out : " No ! " and went hastily forward , exclaiming in a loud voice to himself : " His heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of talk , as if a man 's heart meant little to him if it be not a heart full-set on fishing . There being a second occasion , to wit : a dispute between the brothers which took place on the Yarmouth Wharf , on the day Mark Dillon left the vessel , having come aboard at Gloucester to act as her sailing master in the race to that port , which race was accomplished in laughter . Having taken bait , and all men being ashore , I returned alone to the vessel and made up my mind to finish my pipe on deck , it being a balmy evening and the land breeze sweet to the nose . This being ten o'clock at night . I had hardly set foot on the deck before I heard a voice raised in the quarrel and saying : " No ! No ! Give up the dories and fish with nets ? I 'd a thousand times rather see you dead than leading such a life . " Also : " Will you treat a dorymate so for the sake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Captain Delahanty and he addressed himself to his brother Abel . To these words I heard Abel Delahanty make this reply : " I 've seen the day , Stephen , when you thought and spoke of her in a different and better way . And I sometimes think that beneath your anger and scorn there is another feeling , which does you more credit than your words and sneers . " I went forward and heard no more . I beg leave to say that the female person made mention of in the above was not the Mara . No , this should be a woman well known to both the captain and his brother . For an opinion , not borne out by any other suitable evidence , I will say she was the subject of much discourse between these two young men . I now go to the fishing and to the happenings of the third day , and the fatalities thereof . On this day our luck held and we took eighteen thousand pounds  | of fish ; for the most part , chicken halibut , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my own dory being one hundred fifty pounds and over to the eye and heft of arm , though not weighed out , of course . It was noted by the captain that those dories lying to the westward were doing well , and that those working to the eastward were not well loaded . There was but a small difference of miles in the positions , but it was enough to make us give consideration ; whereupon , he made soundings and found that the western dories were working in sixty to seventy fathoms of water and the eastern dories were in forty fathoms and less . The captain said to his brother in my presence : " There 's something queer about this set . The fish are in the hole . ' T is a close matter for us . We must stay on them . Let a mark-buoy be rigged and we 'll jog around it tonight . " " ' Twill be done , " said Abel Delahanty . He thereupon turned to his dorymate , the late Seth Dolan , and gave him the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night . " There being no mark-buoy aboard the vessel , I lent a hand and rigged said buoy with Seth , using the spare mast of Number Nine Dory , the cork of a lifebelt picked up on the voyage previous , and a set of dry-cell batteries always carried by us for this purpose . For the light itself , I made use of a hand flashlight , fed from the batteries which were lashed to the mast and made snug . This mark-buoy was well rigged and soundly , always a necessary thing , but in our case needed even more , for we must have the fish and must have a good mark because there was some weather making . If I say so as should n't , a better mark-buoy could not be found . The greater my surprise , therefore , when there comes a cry from the bow-watch in the first watch of the night , and the rain falling and a squall passing over us with considerable violence . And his cry was : " Mark-buoy ! Mark-buoy ! Can you make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aft to speak to the helmsman ; and latterly repeated . At the time , I was lying in my bunk in the cabin and Seth lay in his bunk , aft of mine . The captain and his brother were seated on the locker , where they conversed . Now , at a word from the helmsman , I rolls from my bunk and pulls on my boots , knowing well that the loss of this mark-buoy would be considered a disaster and likely to bring a haughty show of temper from the captain if it proved that the loss came to us because of a lack in seamanship , namely , the rigging of that buoy . This being the work  | of my hands , I made haste to go on deck with Seth , hoping that I might be able to make out the light . I followed the captain and Abel to the deck . I heard the captain say : " What 's this about the mark-buoy ? You ca n't make it out ? " The helmsman said this was so . I asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , did you ? " " Plain enough I made it out , " says he , " and kept her jogging not two miles to leeward of it . " Abel said to the bow-watch : " How long since you saw the light , chum ? " To which he replies : " ' Tis n't two minutes gone out of my sight . I had my eyes fixed on it , there being nothing else to look at , and out she went . Just as if somebody ups and hits her with a maul . " " And where was it lying , would you say ? " This the captain asked . The watch holds out his arm , so that it is clear the mark-buoy be lying on the N-E-N course the schooner was then on . I will tell you about the weather at that hour . I have already made mention of the squall . This came in from about west and was blowing so hard that now and then the seas broke over the weather rail . On the best authority ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been banging half round the compass since nightfall . At this hour , the squall having blown steadily for half an hour , it was plain to be seen that it was , indeed , no squall but a real breeze o ' wind making . And it is well known that those waters are cranky ; they are like Misaine Bank in summer , where sometimes a very big sea will come up and without warning . I will state my opinion , as a doryman , of the condition of the sea at the time in question , and that opinion is this : that it was no sea into which a dory could be dropped with safety . And by no means could a dory be dropped in safety if it had a particularly hard job of work to do . Judge how great was my surprise when the captain turned to Seth and said : " I told you to rig that mark-buoy and rig it well . Now something 's happened to it . Find out . Take Number One Dory . " " Why , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reckon that a dory can be put over just now . " But Captain Delahanty roared out at him , he being full of a fear that his fish would be lost and his first trip since the Sable Island thing should be a failure , and he so proud . Whereupon up speaks brother Abel in an easy way , which was  | always his way , and he says : " I would n't let a dory go over in a sea like this , Steve . ' Tis n't a wise thing to do , in my opinion . " Perhaps it was in the noise of the squall and the rattle of the seas against her bulwarks that the captain does n't hear his brother 's words . Whether or not , he puts up his voice in the launch of anger and hollers to him : " What 's that you say now to the captain of the Mara ? " This being such a strange way of putting a fact so plainly known to all that I will make a point of saying : indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much more : that he uttered the name of the Mara in a manner revealing grave surprise , as if ( so to say ) the skipper of an ordinary vessel might hear and brook gainsaying , but the skipper of the Mara  --  how could he , above all men , take Nay ' from any man ? If this be so , had it always been so ? And was she a vessel set peculiarly apart and above all others ? In beauty and in pride of name , let it be so , for who cares to tarry in great hours and dig into such matters ? Nevertheless , in the way of life and work  --  no ! For ' t was our custom aboard the Mara to speak our piece and to empty the full stock of our mind in time of need , according to the way of the first Captain Delahanty and of Captain Philadelphia Mulligan , both sages and men of the brilliant way , yet ever eager to hear a knowing man set up his case in time of need and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! a captain of the Mara stands upon a nicety and cries out against old times , old manners . Now for Abel 's answer , which lies eager in my mind and memory , it being like all words said by that man . " Even so ! " To which the captain shouts in anger : " Even so , do you say ? " " Aye ! " And a look passes between them by the light of torches . Cries Abel , standing forward one pace : " Even so ! Were I such a captain , I 'd not give an order this night that I would not carry out before my men . Here be a risk of death and a poor risk at that ! " " Do you say so ? " Into which the captain puts the very life of scorn and taunt . Whereupon , the late Seth Dolan comes forward and pours on this sinful spread of anger that part of him which is his gentility , saying clearly and his hands raised outward , one to the captain and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fault is mine and therefore let the quarrel come to an end . ' T is soonest mended by my word and deed , who is at fault .  | If any man must set things to right and save our yonder wealth , that man be I , and I will go by myself . " I wish to avouch and solemnly describe , by these presents , that in all my life as a man aboard the Mara , and his companionship the while , I never heard that man say so many words . Nay ! Since he was a greenhorn and snatched from death by the late father of these young captains , since that time he had not spoken so much , to my knowledge . Whereupon Abel , his dorymate , says : " If you go , I will go also . " At which Seth halts , his head bowed , his eyes fixed upon the pitching and watery deck ; and I knew he would say no more and that he would go because of the captain 's most certain rebuke to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Aye ! Had he not pitched over a dory single-handed in the time of the Sable Island thing and had gone into the blizzard alone to save these two ? Ana all this against the word of the sage , The Philadelphia ? To this I testify ! A satisfying man was Seth Dolan , at the first hour and the last , and a right man . If that man is right who lays down his life for another in the way of duty and the way of comradeship . For myself , the hope of an easy way out of this hardship came to me , because I kept well and lively in mind that the schooner was bearing down on the position of the mark-buoy . Therefore , the buoy might be seen and fished up from the deck with neither risk nor harm , if our luck should hold . Nearly so ! The watch sang out : " Mark-buoy ! Mark-buoy ! " and I u took up a boat hook and tried for it , where it ran under the leeward rail . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this comes to no good , because of the poor light , and we made haste to bring the vessel round , but before this both Abel and Seth had climbed into the dory and the watch let it go and the dory fell into a great sea . Abel sat at the oars and let drive . So they vanished , swiftly pursuing the buoy and a torch burning in the hands of Seth . Beyond the dory I saw the starboard lamp of a vessel . A cry came out of the darkness , and a shout , which was an appeal to us . Therefore , we steered in that direction and by the light of our torches we saw the dory capsized and the mark-buoy made fast to it . I clearly saw a man raise himself to the bottom of the dory by means of its plug-strap . I saw his pale face shine like bone in the dark and amidst the foam . Now this was Abel Delahanty . This I knew because his face had gained no color in the short time of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man could ? No one ! He crouched on the  | dory and then slipped into the water like a tramp seal playing . He passed under the dory and appeared again . Once again he shouted to us as we came nearer and he dived into the sea and went under the dory . A long time he was gone and then all hope was lost for him by me , so long was he gone . All our torches were brought to the leeward rail and the captain put the wheel down and steered to windward of the dory . I heard him cry : " Abel ! Abel ! Where are you ? " Great was the sorrow in that man 's cry . Now appeared Abel between the dory and the Mara , and he swam with one arm and laboriously , for he carried a burden in the water and a watery burden , which was Seth . Seeing this , I took up a buoy and jumped into the sea by him and clung to it and shoved it toward him as best I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only groaned in bitterness and woe for new pain and suffering . Thus they took us up and I stood on the deck , but Seth , he did not stand . Nor ever would again , his soul having fled his body . Now Abel lifted up the body and carried it down the deck and laid it before his brother , saying to him : " Here then is Seth , for whom our father died , and who would gladly have died for you , and , indeed sought such a death on Sable Island ! It is a life wasted ! Life of a man dear as a father . For this ! " And with a piteous outcry he lifted the mark-buoy and hurled it against the wheel , where his brother stood , his eyes widened . Now the captain advanced one stride from the wheel , his hand yet upon the spokes , and let from his gaping mouth a most dreadful cry , for the upturned face of Seth looked in coldness at him . And Abel he came nearer , shouting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish now ? You murderer ! " To which the captain gave answer : " Do you say so ? Do you say so to me ? " Abel cried out to him : " And your brother also ? " With these last he raised his open hand , neither to strike nor to seize , but to curse his brother ; and a word I could not hear did come from his mouth . At which moment the captain left the wheel . The Mara lurched , the captain crying out again in a wail , struck his brother mightily on the jaw , so that Abel spun on the pitching deck and fell sideways , struggling to keep his feet , but he could not and he went over the side and vanished into the sea , crying out loudly . But not in fear . No ! He cried out like a man gone mad .  | Therefore , I , Mr. William Xavier O'Malley , by this hand and by these presents , accuse and name Captain Stephen Delahanty as the murderer of his dutiful brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Between the end of my reading and the beginning of something new , there came a long pause , in which I fixed my gaze on the empty stove , thus to save my eyes , for the time being , from my brother 's gaze which must be hard to bear because of the agony therein . I heard a sound from him , and he shuffled the papers in order , pretending a concern with them so that I might put off the encounter . His teeth grinding . Yes , I heard this clearly and knew that he strove hard to keep down a cry and to keep off his tongue certain words that spun hurling in his mind . And these words ? Easy to say : " Stephen Delahanty shall hang for this ! " I lifted my eyes again . Three times during the reading I had raised them to his face and found him impassive . A judge unstirred . Now a yellowish tide had risen across his face ; rather , the tide had ebbed in horror and had left the face drawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay in the line of his brows . And the yellow hair above his temples had turned dark because of the sweat . That Satanic look had left him , unless a man can imagine the look of Satan falling . I muttered : " And yet I do not believe it . Abel is not dead . " He made no reply . Neither did he change the fix of his greenish eyes , fixed on that paper with a look of famine . I heard the grind of his teeth and saw his tongue lick his lip . Nevertheless , he seemed to be not awake . He had stood during the reading . Now he moved forward a pace and thrust out his hands and pointed the forefinger down , held it so in a gesture of command . Whom did he wish to summon ? O'Malley ? O'Malley to be put to the question ? No . I knew his wish . I held out the paper , saying : " This , I suppose , is for the captain to hold . " His left hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the companionway . When I closed the slide , I looked down into the cabin . He had n't moved . His finger pointed downward ; as if in a trance , he held it so and waited , trusting , I knew , that certain words about to be heard would mend all within him . That strange hope was mine also , yet my heart grew sicker with the desolation made by his hope and by his face gleaming wet under the cabin lamp . I stepped to the wharf and stood a while in the darkness . I waited for the moon . A cloud took long in passing through her light . The light came out of her two horns and I went across the wharf and through the open doors of the sail-loft until I came to the berth which the Mara used . I went down to the seaward string-piece and waited . It was lonely there by the dripping eaves . I heard shouts coming faintly from the town streets . I heard someone move in the darkness behind me . I turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boots treading lightly on the boards . I kept my mind warmly upon the watcher , thinking that he must have known me and my errand and in goodness had left me so . Mist and rain hid that figure from me , yet I perceived that it moved reluctantly . It seemed to me I knew who it was , had recalled a gait . Far down , an alarm stirred in me , or recognition ; no doubt , of a mourning boy who had heard of the Mara 's loss and had come in the night to see . And then I began my watching for the Mara and , at last , let my thought turn where it longed to turn : to Abel . Abel gone . Many times had I slouched there , as child and man , waiting for her topsails to show under the moon and her bow to pierce and ruffle the harbor moonglade . Many times in joy , and only twice in sorrow , such  | as now . Yet never such sorrow . Arrivals and departures ; by moonlight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ever the same beauty and the same grace , departing in hope , returning with hope fulfilled . The moon adorning white mastheads ; stars falling against blue waterways ; voices of all her captains and shouts of topmastmen . So , on this night , the wind stayed fair for her , and the moon lighted the way for her , casting such a serenity over headland , shore , and sea , that this peace and beauty alone seemed real , the hour past a dream to be forgotten . It is a common thing that a man 's reason may be overcome by an outspread beauty of the world . They used to say in the olden times that even the wisest of men , should he sleep in the moon 's view , might become fey , be wise no longer . Moon-heat . This thing touched me then , and my hope rose with the rising of the moon . A childlike hope of this shape : Seth , he is gone beyond all doubt ; Abel , he is not gone ; for if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ search for him ? A measure of joy came to me and I said : " Seth is gone and it may be that for this no blame will lie with Stephen . Surely not ! Abel , in a way yet hidden from us , is alive . Therefore , Stephen is free . " How reasonable this seemed in the moonlight ! I wished to run back to the Medea and give my great news to Michael . This I could not do . Yet I was sure that he would believe me ; and this certainty may be credited to the moon . Which now filled me with more than certainty , so that when I saw the first gleam of the Mara 's mainsail , where it came under the lower limb of the moon , I was ready to shout as in the old days , " The Mara ! The Mara ! And all well aboard . " And , indeed , I became a boy again , in a mythic dream turning our work-a-day harbor into the Athenian port and the heroes returning from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Medea , our enchantress in the West . Now her first topsail shone in an ivory gleam within the fall of moonlight and her foresail shone a broad sweep . Her port light twinkled in the outer spray , and vanished as she steered for the passage . The music of the breakers played grandly for her . The last of the outer seas broke over her brow . She rolled and cleared herself , came on swiftly , her sails whitening under the increasing splendor of light , which became more brilliant than a day . The foam before her waned . She sailed into the moonglade and came onward through the ripples , matching the moon in beauty and making my hope even stronger . Nothing in her that was marred ; all was as before . In this , I believed . Yes , had I heard Abel 's shout to the topmastmen , I should not have been astonished .  | This stately advance continued until I said to myself : " He 'll order her sails off now . " Yet this was not done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea-bird rushed and cried crank ! crank ! He had flown out of the dark this side of the moonglade . Lingering yet in the old half-dream , I looked after the bird to note the direction of his flight , as if , indeed , it might have a meaning for us in our time . I saw nothing in the darkness of the wharves , and heard only the echo there of his passing cry , an unknown cranking . A fancy . Nevertheless , the strength of fancy made an omen of that flight , which I was about to dismiss as a grown man should , when  --  behold ! ? another such signal from our childhood struck eyes and heart and hope at once . The sails of the Mara had become black . Their shimmer and their crowded liveliness vanished . The canvas went dead black . Unreasonable terror shook me and showed how insecure had been the foundation of my hope . Nothing much had happened . In less than a wink of time , I understood that a heavy shower had crossed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vessel . These changes had made the sails seem black . Nevertheless , between sight and understanding , before any reason could stand on my side , I had lost all the gain I had made since leaving the Medea . " Has not blood been shed unjustly ? And by blood shall be avenged ? Break not my heart by questioning ! " Thus the King cries . In a chasm between black cliffs , Minotaur dies . In a black chasm among the sunless roots of Ida , by the looms of stone and among the stones of darkness , his voice bellows , his strange blood gushes . Theseus wields the blade , goes under barrows of eternal snow , and departs , forgetful of his pledge , under a black mainsail to the shores of violet and asphodel . And the King , his father , watches on Acropolis , beholds the black spread far off and , in grief , falls to his death . Folly now stood on the side of reason . At that moment , I gave up Abel Delahanty for dead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minotaur is ; because , in giving up my dorymate as lost and murdered in yonder sea , there came into my heart , for the first time ever , a hate . I fell back under the dripping eaves . The rain poured . I looked out and saw the sails come down . Mainsail and foresail , and , under headsails , she came gliding to me like a serpent . Her spars crossed the murky sky. ; her white mastheads gleamed like bones . She grew , became immense , threw her pall of darkness over me until I shuddered once again . I heard a voice cry out : " Now then ! Now then ! " Two men jumped  | to the wharf . A third followed . Never looking backward or calling to the Mara , Stephen ran toward the sail-loft . He saw my face shining in the rain . He called out : " Michael ! Michael ! Is that you ? " Being a new kind of man now and freshly burdened , I could say nothing at once . Which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die in my time , short as that time had been . Yet I had never knowingly stood face to face with a man who had , in anger or in error , taken another 's life . ' T is little in our time because there are many men walking the calm streets who have taken lives by the scores , and this in the line of duty , a duty that creates , just the same , that certain coldness which we find all over . You can understand why the life of one young man may count as nothing to them . Or little . To me , it could not be so . I was made sick by the nearness of the fratricidal hand ; and the pity stirred by his cadaver of a face did not match my horror of his presence , nor lessen it . Yes , Stephen Delahanty had changed already . Who would have thought there could be even less flesh on the bones of his long face ? Yet it was so . His eyes were only dark sockets , out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That you , Michael ? Speak up , chum ! " I stepped out of the shelter and answered in a voice that astonished me by its calmness . " No , not Michael . Mark . ' T is his brother , Mark , waiting for you . " I remember well how those three words ( " ' T is his brother " ) came unwittingly off my tongue . They seemed to have a singular and private meaning to me at the time , seemed to be a sort of declaration . That we were strangers ? Enemies henceforth ? Perhaps . I am not able to say exactly just now . It is true that he and I now bade farewell to all serenity . Our decline as men had begun . The dorymen who were tying up the Mara spoke in low tones . Another came up to the wharf and stood there , without speaking . Her lights went out . I heard the cook cry out . " No , no , leave be , leave be ! " A man answered roughly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own bloody business . " He then cursed the day he was born . A moment later , a bundle of gear came flying up from the Mards deck . It rolled behind Stephen . He looked over his shoulder and stared at the bundle . An old navy sea-bag came up the same way and I heard a familiar voice say : " My gaff there ! Hand me my gaff , chum . Like a good lad . " The cook spoke again . This time the reply came from two or three men who declared they could stay no longer on the schooner because  | she lay under a curse . The same familiar voice , kindlier than the other , said : " Cook , I advise you to clear out . Get your gear and clear out . You 've got enough money to stay ashore . You wo n't be on the beach . " " Oh , no ! no ! " Stephen turned his head to me and asked : " Where ? " I replied : " Aboard the Medea . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found Michael standing exactly where I had left him and in the same trancelike posture , the folded papers in his hands , his eyes fixed on the pool of light cast down by the lamp . I at once perceived that his meditation had done him no good . Even now , he seemed hardly awake . So strong was this impression that I spoke loudly , as if , indeed , he slept on his feet . " Here is Steve ! " Again without design , I made a queer blunder of speech by adding : " Captain of the Mara . " Michael meant to greet Stephen in a gentle way . His lips broke out of the stern cast . However , he hid a look of vexation for my words and this crossed his smile , so that ' t was hard to read his expression . His ambiguity baffled Stephen , who became alarmed and hesitant . He did n't know how to handle himself in these circumstances . Since he now stood in the lamplight , I saw his face more clearly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It had scarcely healed . Stephen said : " Michael , I 'm sorry to say that I come home with my colors at half-mast . " " I saw them at half-mast some time ago , " said Michael rather loudly . " I did n't hope that you had any reason to take them down . I 'm sorry for it . " He then held up the sheaf of papers . " We have here Will O'Malley 's story  --  written out  --  of the happenings aboard the Mara . What 's your story ? " " Seth Dolan is drowned through an accident . An old man ! And Abel  --  he is gone . " " You say Seth is drowned . But you do not say that Abel is drowned . You say that he is gone . What meaning are we to give to that word ' gone ' ? " " I mean that he is gone from the vessel . I mean  --  yes , I must mean that he is dead , too . " Extraordinary expressions , even for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face after this last sentence . These words killed any hope that Michael may have held . The blood began to seep out of his cheeks again . His goldenness waned . He became ugly . Ugly as the  | other . As for Stephen , the flat statement concerning Abel 's death had been an effort , an effort of judgment against hope . He paused after the sentence , his lids part way drawn over dead , dark eyes . I said to myself : " He admits the death , but does not lay it to drowning . He condemns himself . ' T was his blow . " Aloud I said : " We should sit down . " Neither ' of them listened to me . " What is the story ? Tell me the story . " Stephen did n't seem able to begin his story at once . He kept his eyes searching Michael 's face as if he waited a sign of some sort before he began . He amazed me then  --  and Michael , too  --  by a whispered sentence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , yes ! I wanted to go . " Michael shouted : " What say ? Speak up , Steve ! What 's this ? You offered to go over for the mark-buoy ? Hey ? Is that it ? " " Of course ! Of course , I did , Michael . " He now exposed his eyes fully to the light and the deadness in them changed for a look of much intelligence . He had perceived that the story told to us had either been incomplete or incorrect . He found some relief in this discovery . " You do n't think I 'd ask a doryman to do something I would n't do myself ? " " No ! " This was Michael 's first chance to say anything to help Stephen . He became perceptibly lighter in spirit the moment he had said the word . I said : " Steve , begin at the beginning , the way Will O'Malley did , and we 'll see what 's wrong with his account . I do n't think he 's a good reporter of such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're one of them . " " Aye . " Michael struck his hands together . " True for you , Markl Here 's where we get the right of it . " He stretched out his right hand and touched Stephen 's arm . " Begin ! " With greater skill than O'Malley had shown , Stephen ran through the fishing briefly and came to the time when it was found expedient to mark the fish . He did n't seem willing or able to describe the origin of this plan . He slurred over it after a vain attempt to recall who had first mentioned the buoy . " I must tell you that Abel and I have been having some trouble . I mean that there were disputes all the time . Quarrels . A matter of the family . And business . The Mara , yes , the Mara above all things . The vessel was left to us and we  --  yes , we were left to the vessel , just as you  | and Mark were left to the Medea . This was always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had to . And yet  --  oh , Michael ? I could n't understand it ! ? he wanted to go . He wanted to leave her . Wanted to leave his work . " " For what ? What did he wish to do ? What was the matter with him ? " My questions provoked only a return of dullness in Stephen . No , not dullness . Rather , a waning of that first fire . " He wanted a new life . Because he had come to hate and fear the old way . Dories and gales he feared . Not for himself . No ! For all men . He had some idea about " ? here he sought a phrase and settled on it with a look of perplexity ? " about happiness . Yes , that was it ! Happiness . " He stayed on that word like a man who drew good from its very sound . " Seth ! What a curious thing ! He was always the quickest to obey an order , even though he knew what he meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aboard the schooner . I would n't risk him in poor circumstances . Never ! So when it was clear that the mark-buoy had to be taken in by a dory  --  or else a fine lot of fish lost  --  why I said I 'd do it myself . " " Why did you say that ? " " I 'll tell you , Mark . Here it is . I was responsible  --  after Seth and Will O'Malley  --  for the rigging of the buoy . If it failed , I could n't ask any other man to go after it unless it was a safe job . And this was n't safe ! The breeze itself was bad enough , but I 'd been amazed the way those big seas had been coming up . As usual , with hardly a sound before they were on you . So I said to Seth : Now , Seth , you go below and turn in . I 'll take care of this . I 'll have to put a dory over and get that buoy , but I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this he replied : You have the right , Captain , to deprive me of my duty to you and the vessel , but you will not do so in this instance : Those were exactly his words . I do not mean that this is just close to what he said . I mean that this is exactly what he said . " Now , " continued Stephen , " when the position of the buoy was settled on , I turned to Seth and said : " T is plain something has happened to the buoy . We 'll have to find out and bring it in and rig it again and rig it well . Take the helm and I 'll take No . One Dory . ' To which he answered : Why , Captain , begging your pardon , I do n't reckon that a dory should be put over right now ' ? and at this I was ready to jump on him because he was not only telling me what he should do , but also what I should do . And this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You were angry ? " He let his head droop a little . I could see the sweat coming over his forehead , just as it had come over Michael 's . " Yes , " he said , " I was angry . " He knew well enough the meaning of my question . He kept his silence awhile and then said : " I 'd been afraid from the outset that the trip would be a failure and I did n't want that because it was the first since the Sable Island thing and I had failure there , too . Because of my anger . " He became listless . His hands came slowly together and fumbled each with each . " Failure then , failure now . But then I failed with honor . And I was a doryman . Now I am the captain and  --  there is no honor left to me . There is nothing left of all that I saved . Perhaps " ? and this he said with an increase of dullness ? " perhaps not even life . Which I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I asked , " that at this point your brother took the side of Seth and spoke against dropping the dory ? " " The side of Seth ? " He lingered on this in a puzzled manner . " I ca n't say that , Mark . Not for sure . I can tell you what he said . That 's all . " " What did Abel say ? " " He said : I would n't put a dory over in a sea like this , Steve . ' Tis n't a wise thing to do , in my opinion . " ' Michael said : " The differences in the stories continue . " He folded his arms on his breast and began to ponder an inner problem . " Here we have Abel trying to keep you on deck . Apparently , I mean . " Stephen replied : " That was my understanding . Yet I may be wrong . I am not trying to defend or explain my actions or words . You know that . " " We understand . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the story , and he made it plain to us that he had been angry at this interference with his decision to do the work himself . He said that he had protested against their words and had directly demanded an explanation from Abel . However , in attempting to give an exact relation of words and attitudes he became so agitated that he could n't go on . The pour of sweat over his forehead grew . He was losing flesh . His mouth had dried up on him . He kept licking at his lips . I was aware of the kind of images that paraded in his mind . Crimes at sea are not like crimes on land . Anger has become a sort of excuse on land , a neat arrangement of Saxon law for those who can afford anger . At sea , anger itself may  | be a crime . This he knew . No doubt , it was this knowledge that baffled his skilled tongue . At last , Michael spoke in the soothing vein . " Take it easy , Steve . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it . ' T is Abel we want to hear about . There is no blame for you in the loss of Seth . " This manoeuvre failed . I saw at once that Captain Delahanty was hungering for a sweeping word from one of us that might set him free . He did n't get it at the time . After a false start or two , he turned to the locker and sat down , his hands hanging lifelessly over his knees , his head drooping in a dead stare , and his eyes fixed on the edge of the pool of lamplight , where a tiny golden surf rolled and fell . Until the very end of the reeling , he kept in that one posture , scarcely changing . ' T was a monotone of his body to suit a monotone of voice , heart , and spirit . The grand chords were missing . Thus he related Seth 's speech and Abel 's words , and came quickly enough to the moment when the dory went over with Seth and Abel in it . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at this point , of Seth 's loss . Then , and many times since , I found in my consciousness this strange but firm opinion : that Seth had tired of life and that he had willingly gone to meet death . Why ? The reason can not be told exactly because it has no exactness ; in fact , is not rightly a reason at all . My best belief is that Stephen 's report , subtly and ever unconsciously combining with some minor fact in Will O'Malley 's paper , proved to the heart a fact that could not be proved to the mind . Had he not once wished to die if they might be saved ? " The first thing I knew the dory was over . Almost before I could bring the wheel up , meaning to keep to windward of the dory , why , there was the dory capsized and Abel 's face as clear to me in the black as a face  --  a mask of ivory . I had no great fear for him . The water was n't cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And you know that he could always swim like a halibut . " But the dory had gone over in the squall . And it was clear to me that Seth had been caught under it . Perhaps fouled up in the anchorline or wires of the mark-buoy . I brought the vessel up as best I could . I saw Abel slide over the dory and come up again . He cried out something and dived again , a shallow , twisting dive . He was down a long time and I heard a doryman next to me say : He 's gone , too ! Abel ca n't get out with him . ' I knew better . But the idea of his being caught under there  --  perhaps by a drowning man  --  this idea choked me and I could barely shout . I cried out for a dory to be put over and I yelled  | to the watch to take the wheel . I could n't see much now . There was some confusion . I think I had ordered the torches to the leeward rail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room for them . The men had to stand there with them and some of the men were shouting and cursing . " When he told of Abel 's rising through the foam and his laborious swimming , his voice took on a degree of warmth , as if enlivened by the hope that must have come into his heart when he saw his brother with that burden . It was Will O'Malley , he said , who first understood that a dory might not be quick enough and , therefore , flung over a buoy from a dory and went after it himself . He considered this a daring thing to do . " And they pulled Abel in over the side and Seth , and I saw that Seth was dead because he lay limp under their hands . Will O'Malley had the mark-buoy . By this I judged that Seth had clung to the markbuoy anchor-line all the time . Even in death he clung to it . Now Abel lifted up Seth 's body and came aft with it , and many of the dorymen cried out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the torches and they could n't help but look down at him , and this glance at the dead made them cry out as it made me cry out . " Do you see the meaning of Abel 's carrying that dead doryman to me at the wheel ? It was an accusation of me ! He did n't have to say anything , Michael ! He said everything when he came over the break looking down in the torchlight at the dark face of the dead . " Stephen groaned and stayed silent . Yet he never looked up at us . No , he kept his eyes on the gilded space under the lamp . I looked away from him and toward Michael . He , too , suffered abominably . He had that poor trick of pressing his teeth down on his lower lip . I did n't understand it . What 's it for ? To keep from screaming ? There were three drops of blood on his lip . I went to him and wiped the blood away and whispered : " Do n't take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reply , just as if we were alone . " Why does n't he tell us the real story ? The real thing ? What 's wrong here , Mark ? " " Nothing . " I said . " Wait ! Wait ! " I myself could wait no longer . I had something else to do that night before too late an hour , and had no doubt there would be pain enough for me yet forthcoming . I urged Captain Delahanty to speak . I spoke roughly to him , knowing his pride would stir . I asked : " Abel 's words to you at this point  --  what were they ? Take your time and give a proper answer . "  | He shuddered . He swung his knee outward so that I thought he meant to rise . Instead he did the most extraordinary thing . He covered his mouth with his hand and , from behind this barrier , cried out in a sort of moan ! " Ah , why did he strike me ? Why did he do so ? Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this ; nevertheless , he remained hunched up . When his hand fell from his mouth , I saw again the bruised , unhealed lip . I began to speak , then stopped . I looked to Michael . He wished to speak . Yet he could not . I saw clearly that a fresh , strong light had passed over his face . He had found something that gave him hope . And this uprising of my brother 's spirit drove mine down further than it had been . Escape ! He had seen the way out for his friend , and yet he was so unsure of his joy that he dared not speak lest another word spoil him of his joy . I would not let it be so . False or true , ' t was too early for either heart or mind . I said to Stephen : " Why did Abel strike you ? Why do you ask us ? Is that just a rhetorical question , not needing an answer ? Or do you really wish to know ? " He looked up at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without moving his head . " Rhetoric ? I ? No , Mark , I meant it . I meant the question . " " That 's impossible ! " I shouted . " How in hell 's name can we answer when we know nothing ? Nothing except what is written there ? Yet if you want an answer , I 'll give it to you . If your brother struck you in the mouth and gave you that break in the flesh I see there  --  if he did , it was because he believed you had caused the death of Seth by your anger and by your incompetence as a skipper . If you ask me , Captain Delahanty , there 's your answer . " Michael roused himself from his thought and checked me with his hand and glance . " Let 's get on with it . That 's all we need . The rest of the story , Stephen . Take it easy , chum . " He closed his hand fiercely on my arm and added : " You take it easy , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shouted : " I 'll do and say what I damn please ! Here 's my chum gone and this guy here asking me why Abel struck him . If he really struck a blow , this one here would be dead or gabbling through a smashed jaw . Even I  --  I would n't dare strike a man for fear of killing him . And Abel , he is  --  he was stronger than I am . " I took a step nearer to Stephen and said in a better tone ,  | a calmer one : " He did n't strike you . He slapped you . If he did anything . ' Tomas part and parcel of his act in taking the body aft to you . A gesture . " I laid my hand on his shoulder and pressed my fingers down until I felt the flesh . " You know that , do n't you , Captain Delahanty ? " He said : " Yes ! " Since he had spoken , I carried him on by asking what Abel had said when he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not differ greatly from the words set down by Will O'Malley . The chief charge was an addition . To the sentence : " It is a life wasted ! " , as it was written , he added two words : " for fish . " Stephen said : " By now , I must admit , I was rattled . Actions that I might have taken in my stride a season earlier were now more than I could bear . I seemed to have the fever coming back on me . It was a time for calm judgment and I had no coolness left in me . I could n't help it . I was driven to action . Anything to break up the scene before me and give my mind a rest . I meant not to look at Seth 's face . Ah , ' t was something no man could stand ; for I remembered what they had told me about my father 's death and how it was that he died with a laugh on his lips because he had given his life for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! There ! I 'd have been better off if he 'd died in disgrace or in an accident that had filled him with horror . Then his face might have been like the face of the other dead I have seen . But it was n't so . No ! No ! His face had a calmness on it . Not a smile . No , not that . But something  --  something  --  I ca n't lay hold of it . ' T was ? ah ! it was like the face of a god . A god doomed and chained to die . An angel 's face . " He paused over this image and , after taking a deep breath , he muttered : " An angel accusing me . By the emptiness of his eyes . Captain Delahanty did not listen to my next words which were : " Tell us what Abel said to you then . " Instead of replying , he spoke to himself in a murmur . He made the classical statement : " Since then , I have n't slept . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Michael repeated my question . Captain Delahanty searched awhile and said : " Abel stood by the body and cried out : Can a man 's life be worth less than fish as in the old days ? You murdered him ! ' And I cried out , too , saying : Do you say so ? Do you say so to the captain of the Mara ? ' And he roared at  | me and came nearer and shouted something about a brother , which was part of it that I could n't hear clearly . There was so much going on . " And then ? " " And then I let go of the spokes and he shouted another word and struck me across the mouth . He did so . He did it when I had left the wheel . The vessel lurched before a big sea and I  --  I ? " " What ? " I cried . " Say it ! Say it ! " " The blow ! The blowl " At this , he rose to his feet , staring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea and farther Bank , and let us see through his agony the terrible scene : slanting deck , and singing gear , torches ablaze and fearful faces under them , the night above , and , before him , the happy dead , and the hero about to die . " I struck his jaw before he could curse me . The vessel had not cleared herself . No one had taken the wheel . She lurched and he fell sideways and then  --  then  --  ah , Michael , he went over the rail ! " He came to a pause , shook his head during it , and then whispered a word hat made me think he had gone mad . So Michael thought ; for he could scarcely get out his whispered What ? What 's that , Stephen ? " I had heard the word . I accepted it , there being no room left in me for wonder or grief . The word was : " Laughingl " " Laughing ? " Michael came up to him and laid his hands gently on his shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That it was true laughter , Steve ? Not ironic ? " " True laughter , Michael . That I swear ! " " And words ? Any words with it ? " Captain Delahanty nodded . He looked sideways . No , not at me . To the other side , as if he expected to see somebody else there . He said : " These were his words : The way to go ! " ' I shouted : " Aye ! The way to gol ' To go to death . " " No , " said Michael , " no , Mark . No . He meant the way  --  the way " To what ? " " To life . " He swung away from the circle of light and entered the dusk beyond . I saw that look of attentive eagerness , which meant that he had , once again , found something I could not find . He kept his back  | toward me . He lowered his head a little . Captain Delahanty stared at his right hand . Michael turned and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He said to the Captain : " He had asked you to let him go . He had asked you to let him go to Quebec Port again . He had a lot of money in his belt . Twenty thousand dollars . " " How did you know that , Michael ? Yes , it was so . " I said : " You are wrong . You are crazy . " Michael paid me no heed . He said to Stephen : " You took up your trawls ? " " Yes ! " " And the dory ? " " What dory , Michael ? " " Number One . The dory they used . " " No ! No ! How could I ? No ! I would n't take it aboard . No , I saw nothing of it . " " Then that is all , Stephen ? " " Yes , Michael , that is all . " Nevertheless , I knew there was more , and that Captain Delahanty intended that there should be more . None of us stirred or spoke . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plea . He did not withhold it long . He flung back his head and asked in a plain , conversational tone : " Michael , am I my brother 's murderer ? " Swept to conviction by his love for his friend , Michael cried out : " If he is dead , you are not his murderer . If he is alive , he alone can free you , " ? then took in his breath deeply ? " from yourself ! " He sighed and with his next words laid down the pattern of our lives : " The search ! The search ! " The other whispered : " Abel ! Abel ! Where are you ? " I said to myself : " They are both half mad . " Captain Delahanty turned toward me : " And you , Mark ? Will you answer my question ? Am I my brother 's murderer ? " I took a stride nearer to that frightful face . I cried out : " If he is dead , you coward , you killed him ! And you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed him in your heart . You will die just the same . " I raised my right hand and struck Cain across the mouth . " Abel is dead . He feeds the salt ! "  | 14 I MADE MY WAY back to the Mara . I had no business there ; neither had I any desire to see her , for the events that had taken place on her deck were beginning to make me wary of her in my secret heart , which is hidden . Nevertheless , I was impelled to go to her . So I did go , and stood on the wharf above her , where she lay in the tide . Now the descending moon lighted the Mara again , and I saw her and all her gear clearly . I heard her quieter music , which was only a sighing . The lamp burned dimly in her cabin . I hailed her . " Hey , the Mara ! Anybody aboard ? " The echo of my hail came so roundly out of the eaves beyond that I turned my head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only then . I meant to go aboard the Mara . I understood my intention . Before this night , I had experienced sorrow , had learned her ways , and therefore knew that I must go closer to the deck where Abel had died , and must stay there a little time . I should never be able to visit his grave , although I should always be near it , on it . He lay in my pasture . There could be no memorial for him . I wished that there might be one . That was my intention : to make the hour a memorial for him . A memorial to Abel and to something else : my own last free loyalty , a loyalty not required by tradition or by custom , but born of itself . Many a mile we had trudged together . Now I must read the Book for him , the stars my witness , and the moon also . All hearts capable of sorrow will understand this need of sorrow ; and will perceive the memorial need . ' T is as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's mother lay dying of her grief , and her  | eyes , no longer obeying her sweet will , could not follow him in the morning light , she had lifted her hand and whispered : " Stay ! Stay  --  in the line of vision ! " and had so departed , gazing at him . Thus , for him , and for me at his side to comfort him , her memorial had not been the line beneath the gravestone line . No , always his memorial had been the beauty of her last desire , its unutterable sweetness everlasting . The line of vision . It is too bad that tears are forbidden to grown men . Why should this be so ? I believe that Theseus , on one occasion , wept ; and he was a hero . He danced also and led the Athenian youth in a noble dance of war , and wept for companions slain . Are there no tears left ? It may be so . Wise Antony said : " If you have tears ? " It is the cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , even when there is full cause for weeping . As with me . So that I sought some other way to make the hour mine forever . I looked to the moon and among the stars , saying to myself : " Shall I call upon the stars to witness ? " I looked toward the town , a rose-colored flare under the westering mist and rain . I heard the town 's rattle and outcry . Between me and the top of the lane , I saw once more that earlier figure , that watcher who had waited hidden under the eaves until the Mara came . And now again lurking under the eaves beyond the open door of the sail-loft , I could see that face only dimly ; and it was pale , bloodless , and so touched with dew that it shone . Once again , there came over me a hint of remembrance , a stirring so delicate that I did n't care to pursue it . Only this thought rose : " Is it somebody come from Boston for news of Seth ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mara and shouted : " Hello , there ! You wish to come aboard ? Aboard the Mara ? There 's no one there ! " Only the echo answered : " Maral Mara ! " Yet I saw ( or fancied so ) an arm in yellow oilskin , raised in a gesture that set me to rest , that left me by myself again . I jumped down to the Mara 's deck . Harsh work to stand there ! Yet it was she who , in the end , gave me all that I required . And more , much more . For in looking about her gear and her furled sails and in counting the dories  --  nine and the tenth one gone  --  I raised my eyes to the descending moon and saw that they had left her colors there . At half-mast . Sometimes extended in the lift of the easterly , sometimes draped about the halyard , the flag of mourning flew . This they had forgotten in their grief and dismay ; and had left to me for my need . I touched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands on the hal-  | yard , keeping my eyes upon the moonlit field of stars , keeping my eyes on The Beauty , which was the only way Philadelphia Mulligan ever spoke of the colors . " But I will wait a little while and remember . I will wait a little while in remembrance of things past , and remember that it was for him , for Abel , that they raised her far away on that Bank where now he rolls , my companion in time , now lost in time . I must remember this forever because there is nothing else to remember of that hour : only their words and the torches flaring in the dark and spray , and the gulls crying the cry they cried for Icarus in the Golden Age , wherein we wandered once upon a time . Icare est chut ici . So he sang out in the cabin below and made our eyes widen and grow dark with wonder and sadness . No more , no more . The little flight is over . Abel ! Abel ! Where now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be ? Where to , chum ? What course in yonder clockwise tide that carries you in ceaseless and eternal round among the sands of darkness and the stones of it ? Staring , idly turning , and shunned by all the creatures of the sea , and spared by all , except the cleansing salt which gives you back to the great sun , drifts you into the eternal stream , by mist and ray and moonheat drawing up all that is ; until the cleansed bones and empty skull lie down again on Sable 's bar . Abel , meek and mild , dead once more in the name of old humanity , now I take down the beauty hoisted in your name and in his name for whom you died the death . By this lowering , I will remember you , comrade ! " I had not been long enough a man to take my thought with the outer grace required . My hands shook . I loosed the halyard , hauled , and the flag flared into my arms held out . And I stood so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come that the little weight of the colors and the slight downward thrust sent me to my knees , where I longed to be , and the tears I had held in shame fell out of my eyes until I cried into the folds of the flag . I cried out words of the stricken heart that wished to make the hour memorable , never-to-be-forgotten . " Abel ! Abel ! So long ! So long ! " If I had seen him die , I should not have acted so . I should not have gone so far that , indeed , a vision came to me of him . Not of him falling with ironic laughter into the water . No . An image of him fleeing westward across a black headland , bleaker than any we had ever watched rising out of the night in a gale . A ghastly place , inhabited by birds that wailed in their flight , and Abel beneath their shuddering wings , his empty eyes staring , an oar flung over his shoulder , his legs  | striding and striking against boulders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellow oilskins . He seemed not to know where he was going . Helpless . He raised his right hand high and flourished a conch-horn which gleamed grandly , and with a purer light , in the murk and above the creeping fog flowing to his knees . The Philadelphia 's horn , lost to us since his death . Clearly I saw the letters nailed into its shell , only now these were changed from silver into gold or fire . He flourished the horn , set it to his wan mouth and blew . I stared into the depth where the image moved and strove to make out the chords and notes amidst clamor of breakers on stones and clamor of the strange birds . Beseeching , the notes of the horn pierced the horror of that place : " Where are you ? Where are you ? I am lost ! Lostl " He held the horn away and his wan lips opened . I made his words take shape and form for me . " Mark ! Mark Dillon ! Come here ! Come here ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I gathered the folds in my hands and said that this could not go on . Yet , I lingered , loath to leave , amidst this hallucination , as if I might really find some contentment there , or not return to the world at all . For this reason , I did not rightly hear that real voice speaking to me , saying : " Mark ! Markl What is this ? " and when I did look up it seemed to me that I had awakened only to rise into worse than chaos because the beauty and sadness of the speaker standing over me made me imagine that I actually had compelled something extraordinary to take place . It is not possible to explain this conviction , nor the calmness that came over me when I bent my head back and looked upward at that face , so long not seen , and always beloved by me , by Abel . A face now terribly adorned by the interlude of time , the years of labor , and by the half-descended moon which laid across the long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gear , and filled the caverns of the eyes with a luminosity wan and dead , as if she had been weeping silently all the time she had stood above me unawares . Coils of dark hair lay awry on either side of her moonlit forehead , and one strand fell a wet sheen , across the collar of the yellow oilskin .. Aye ! she might well have stood for an image of the Mara herself ; a strange , foreign woman , letting the heavy lids come down upon her eyes , and lifting them then to let the moon enter and join with its heat to their hotness in the stare . Is it any wonder that I , in my willing flight away from the world and that fearful deck , 1 , for a very little space of time , believed like a dreaming child that a true vision had come to me and was about  | to speak like an oracle of old , a strange goddess come to utter her wisdom to one who paid due sacrifice ? The black lips opened in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mark ! Mark ! What is this , dear ? " Even this failed to stir me , nor was I stirred out of the trance until the right hand , rough-tipped by work and striving , touched my bared head . It was now that I knew this was no dream and that I had before me , in the moment whirling onward , my most grievous task . Because I did not doubt that she had come to the Mara to meet Abel just as she had come home from France because of Abel . I stood up and faced her and said only one word . Only her name . " Laurie ! " And I at once repeated the word ; but this time in doubt and questioning , which she answered as before . " Mark ! Mark ! What is this , dear ? " Only now a change , ever so slight , came in her voice , making the words seem words of bitterness and weariness , as if , indeed , by her knowledge of our ways , she had divined the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her first question had been uttered in the old , familiar tone , in which so many people , who had thought her ugly , had found her only charm ; because the voice , being low and persuasive , gave meaning  --  a warm meaning  --  to her most ordinary words . Yes , I 've seen a man suddenly start in his place when she said merely : " Good evening ! " Since she had spoken so to me in the old way , the shocking pleasure of remembrance stilled me . I made no answer . I looked away from her , turned my eyes downward to the deck . Her change to bitterness and weariness , or my discovery of those qualities in her words , recalled me . I looked in silence at her ; and , at this greeting , she came nearer to me . I made a step toward her . There we came to our embrace . I did not know what she intended to do ; whether , as at the time of her departure five years since , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the mouth touch my cheek , or whether , in the happiness of reunion , our lips should meet in the kiss , a meeting which I would not willingly endure again , even now when that other , to whom such things of passion were due , could enjoy them no more . This thought crossed my mind and swiftly waned . Came to nothing , as all other thoughts were nothing , in the plain joy of even this possession . This less than possession . Yet , even then , I strongly wished to break through into her consciousness , to understand her because I cared for her , and , by this understanding , do all that I might for her happiness . I was aware of my duty . I wished most strongly to perform it well . Nevertheless , all of this strength waned in the force-  | fulness of her presence , of lips touching her cheek , of her own lips touching my cheek and then , with a sigh , turning to my lips , which met them in joy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wished not to pretend ; nevertheless , something in my heart wished to pretend , even a little longer . Not a day longer , nor the rest of the night , nor for even an hour , a minute . Yes , the desire had become so desperate that it became a pretender too and seemed to declare that , really , only the merest while would suffice , the fewest ticks of time . I knew that this must be the last embrace , that there should always stand between us an unhappy ghost , to whom I had just said my farewell . I wished to say that this was all ; also to say for the last time : " I love you ! I love you ! " and to return to that distance which I had so willingly occupied for so long a time . No doubt , she had seen in my pale and frenzied face a need that evoked all her friendship , an emotion always strong in her ; and made stronger now , no doubt , by this meeting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of me , she embraced the past , which she loved , which was the abundant source of her art and well-being . I am unable to give the inner pattern , the cause of my half-mad return . All I can say is that I turned my mouth from her mouth and , in the embrace to which her tall and broad body swayed , I whispered to her . " He is dead ! " At first , I thought that she had not heard me . She bent back her head a little and looked calmly into my eyes . She seemed at ease . There was no shudder , no tremble of the manlike hands that lay on my shoulders . She made no change in herself except that the lids came heavily , almost sleepily , half-way down and she gazed out of the black circles with a gaze like the Medusa dead . I whispered again : " Did you hear me ? " She replied : " I heard you , Mark . He is dead . That 's what you told me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I saw you looking up at the colors , I knew that in their grief the men had forgotten . Who was he ? A doryman ? And how did he die , Mark ? You knew him well , did n't you ? I could tell that because you were grieving so . I should not have come aboard otherwise . But you were grieving so for him and I longed to be with you and Abel again . I waited a long time and all the men went by and they were all so silent . And I thought I said to myself : Perhaps they are sad because it is Abel 's last voyage . Because we are going away together . " ' Here she paused and without the slightest  | change in her voice , without a flaw in her calmness , she said to me : " It is n't Abel they 've lost this time , is it ? Is it Abel who is dead , Mark dear ? " I said : " Yes , it is Abel . Laurie , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hands and stepped back a space ; and , at this distance , looked not at me , but at the flag lying on my crooked arm . Seeing this , I said : " It was for Abel Delahanty this flag was flown at half-mast . For Abel Delahanty and for Seth Dolan , an old doryman , for whom Abel died . " She clasped her hands lightly and held them so . She turned her head to one side and looked downward , and I knew that she would now try to imagine his ending ; and try in vain . Here , her head bowed in pensiveness , she said aloud and to herself : " It is for this I have returned ! Because he loved me so . And because I loved him . " The moon had gone down , leaving the Mara sighing in the darkness . The easterly wind had fallen off , yet blew enough to clear the rainy sky and let down the starlight , so that the hues of the Mara gleamed and mixed to a cold lightness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and saw her eyes wide open in a gaze that now changed to a glare . A proof that she had come to hate this vessel which she had once loved . Yes , the intensity of that look came to such a pitch that I feared she would in the end cry out in violence and curse the deck in hatred . For she was capable of such a rage . ' T was this in her that had made her rebel and had made her free , when our own ambitions had died because of its lack . I saw again the difference between her and us . Between her and me , especially . Where I had tears to shed and wild images to beckon , she appeared dispassionate . It was appearance only . Her woe was greater than mine ; as she herself was greater . She lifted her head and gave me a look that could have only one meaning . I nodded and said : " Yes . Go and I 'll follow . " She climbed to the wharf , turned once to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the town . I folded the flag and went below to put it into the locker . I turned the lamp low and went on deck , and then followed in her slow footsteps up to the wharf and into the town . I came up until I was not far behind her . She walked along slowly , her head drooping . The hour was late . There were not many passersby , but most of these turned and looked after her . They were captains and dorymen going to their ves-  | sels or hurrying home . It was late and yet they tarried , shaking their heads at her passage . One looked straight at her when he approached , went by , and then turned on his heel and called to her . She stopped . I did , too . I saw him touch his cap and speak . She held out her hand and they shook hands . He asked her a question , offered his help . She declined and went on . I came on . This man greeted me . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who it is , Captain Dillon ? That 's Laura Bannon . I remember her when I worked for her father . She 's been away , has n't she ? " " For many years , " I said . " And now she 's walking the street at this hour of the night and crying . I said : Can I help you , Miss Laura ? ' and she says : No , thank you , Captain Hanlon . ' Just like that  --  she remembers me . " He looked ! ! after her , where she strode up the hill and under the street lamp . " She 's got no folks left to her . Not near ones . I wonder what 's the matter . " I replied : " It 's the same old story , Captain . She 's lost her man . The Mara 's in tonight and old Seth Dolan is gone and Abel Delahantythe captain 's brother  --  he 's gone , too . And it 's for Abel Delahanty she 's crying in the streets . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , for the love of God ! " " Aye , for the love of God ! " And I went on , leaving him sighing on his way . j I followed her in the lane , where it ran among the roses , and upward to the crown of the hill . There , her head against the stars of yonder sea , she halted and looked beyond the land and the lights of the shore to the starlighted Atlantic . Far , far away , sailing on the rim of the world , a passenger vessel went eastward , her rows of lamps making a golden blur above the spray . And nearer , a vessel under sail , on the eastward passage to the Banks . She lifted her head so that her eyes might begin that far journey to where he rolled and her spirit follow , race on unlimited . Above the wind-borne noises of our sea I heard he cry ; and then she turned toward her house . I waited , again , staring at the yellow wall , at the arch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to black in the starlight Beyond the garden wall there came , as always , the old chant , rising to a roar , waning to a silence , momentary and perfect . And between the wax and wane , a bird , nested in the flowering shrub beyond the yellow wall , uttered an  | uneasy cry , because the boughs rose and fell in the wind . Fragrances of sea and garden mixed and eddied below the yellow wall . Days and nights of happiness . Thoughts of youth . Golden memories . I said : " I 'll not go in unless she calls me . " A beam of yellow light , fairly wide , came out of the half-open door , a beam entangled midst the black cluster , black as her lips had been . I pushed the door aside and entered . The room was empty . On a table under the sea-window a single candle burned . Its beam fell upon a handful of jewels flung there : a ring of red stones and a brooch of them in a dark metal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single pearl , two pierced coins of burnished gold . On these things , which were the first seen , I kept my eyes a time in a subtle effort to imitate her calmness . I tried to imagine under what circumstances she might wear these jewels . This room had changed much . Part of the northern roof had been taken out and replaced by wide glass panes . The stars shone muted through the glass . While I stared upward , figuring that this change must be for her work , another squall came over and drenched the glass . It became a silver sheet . On an easel , under the glass , there was a canvas stretched . There were a few lines drawn in a lower corner . There were other paintings on the wall that she had done ; and many laid back to back in the corner . And the tools everywhere . This seemed like disorder , but I suppose it would not seem so to one who knew a little about her work . I heard her move in a room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squall began to lift itself into a real blow . A chill came down from the glassed ceiling . I listened to the wind , an unusual one for the season . I turned . I remembered the fireplace , a very old one of brick with an iron gooseneck hanging over the wood , crosswise on a bed of ashes . I came closer to it and , with some pleasure , saw that she had dropped candle butts between the logs . Her mother used to do this when we gathered there as children to celebrate a winter birthday or feast day . Ten years gone , and more , more . Between this hearth and the door to the other rooms there used to be a horsehair sofa , where Mrs. Bannon had sat to receive us and to watch our careful manners with delighted eyes . Now this old furniture had been taken away . In its place there was a sort of couch-sofa on which a white spread lay . It seemed to me that someone had been lying there ; and I judged that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ odd change to a man who  | had been familiar there , yet , as soon as the boy stepped back behind the scenes , the man found the place a show of beauty and of irresistible determination . There was no sign of defeat here . I heard another noise from behind , and looked up , hoping that this would signal her return . A sound of dishes and a clinking came through a door barely closed . Her rebellion had taken place in this room on the very night that my brother and I had accepted the decision that the new life and its new promise were not for us , that the loss of our father required us to board the Medea in the morning . How clear had seemed our duty on that sorrowful evening , and how great a comfort to us that we had a stern and immediate task to perform ! No doubt existed of the propriety and necessity of our decision . Who was to take the Medea , in the time to come , if not Michael ? And who study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not I ? Should a stranger do so ? " Why not ? " Fiercely cried out so long ago , this had been little Laurie 's answer to our stolid question . " And why not a stranger ? Or a neighbor who can earn his living on her and pay your way at school , Michael Dillon ? Let them talk of duty and tradition and ask who shall be skipper of the Medea if not you . I say it shall not be you and it shall not be Mark ! " " Laurie ! " Seeing the pigtails wag furiously , the eyes darken , and the corners of that sweet mouth crinkle , her mother had frowned over her needles . " Laurie , you must not excite yourself . If your own dear father were here  --  and oh ! how I wish he were  --  he would say to Michael and Mark : Take your places in the dory and do the work of men . It 's the only thing to do and the right thing . Yes , Laurie , Michael and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ praise them for it . " " No ! No ! No ! " Now the tears came , tears of anger and regret . She had turned to us , braving the stern correction , and had suddenly brought her hands from under her apron , where she had kept them . Down on the table she laid the wooden box , pushed it toward us and actually shouted : " Run , Michael ! Run , Mark ! Take it ! Take it , my Greeks ! You must go away . Be great men ! ' T is money  --  money alone that sends you to sea . Take mine ! Take mine ! " She had stumbled forward , unseeing in the rage of tears , and struck the box which fell and opened , spilled its treasure of gold pieces and banknotes . Aye , she ran to me and flung her arms around my neck and in an amazing appeal  | to us  --  an imitation of Grandfather Dillon  --  had cried out : " Flee the wrath to come ! " Well , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failure , the labor in school kitchens far away , the dreadful pain of unfed labor in New York , ? all these obstacles had fallen before her will . If there was good in this world , she deserved it . And yet  --  Ah , yes ! She came into the room . Because of my desire to be correct in behavior , I had prepared some words for an opening . A pretense of some sort . I forget now what they were ; because I forgot them then . I stood wordless . No doubt , I had wished to reveal , or demonstrate , my understanding of her in anticipation of some need to be shown by her . Nothing that I might have done or said would have sufficed . I might have known this had I remained purely myself . I did know it as soon as I gave up being her , or trying to be her . The vividness of my recollection of her early self had taken me far back , had taken me just that far from reality . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the first time in a true light , in silence and in knowledge . The shock seemed more than I could forthrightly bear . Nevertheless , I kept up the embrace of light , stayed in it . Already she had changed . Already her grief had widened the encircling dark so that her unlidded eyes shone brilliantly in the midst of shadows that seemed almost to have been made by hand . But it was the work of weeping , the painting of grief . A strange and powerful work that gave dominance to the eyes , gave them the power to draw and maintain the glance to the exclusion of all other parts of her . Thus she made her speech to me in silence . And her speech ? " I suffer ! " Her torment appalled me . Even then , at that moment , when I had to say to her the words which could only increase her agony . For I knew that had Abel died in the usual work of his vessel , by some not unexpected accident or call of duty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more so , then , when she learned who had struck the blow ! Yet even in this endeavor to reach her , some other part of me made me say to myself : " Can it be that she is really no older than I ? That only twenty years on earth have accomplished this to a soul ? It was this plain and , perhaps , childish wonder that drew me quickly out of the embrace of her eyes , so that I saw her fully again , delicately adorned by the candlelight . This was a true escape on my part because a foreign joy flowed over me at the sight of her grandeur . She had  | bound up the coils of her hair and had dressed in a black gown , a robe rather , that seemed to be made of a beautiful woolen cloth . Had it been held in just by one of her jeweled pins , this robe might have been beautiful in its long fall from her shoulders down over breasts and knees , and to the silvered shoes on which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it carelessly with a common safety pin , thrust in at the division of her breasts . So that neither her robe nor her body in it made any difference in her chief aspect : the speaking eyes , which spoke of her inward excitement and dread . After that momentary exchange , she came forward six paces or so and then she made that most charming of all her gestures : a rise and sharp downfall of her left hand . This I recalled with a sudden pleasure ; and its meaning also : " I 've forgotten something ! " She turned and went out of the room again , the black skirt hiding and revealing each bright shoe in turn . She came back at once , carrying a tray , which bore coffee and a squat bottle of rough-looking wine . The wine splashed when she poured it . I had never seen a woman pour wine or drink it . I did n't know exactly what to do . She waited , too , staring down into the brimming glass . Rain and wind spun above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the garden wall . Because her head was bowed , I could n't see her expression . Nothing was visible to me except the lips , darkly tinted . In the power of sadness her lower lip loosened ever so little until it became a pout , but not for long . Without lifting her head , she pressed her teeth upon it and stared into the wine . Thus she remained until the growing chill touched her throat and breasts . She lifted her hand across the opening of her robe . I said : " I 'll light the fire , Laurie . Here 's a freakish gale blowing up tonight . " I knelt on the hearth and lighted the paper twists here and there . I watched until the flames touched the first candle stub . The crackle of wax pleased me ; and this pleasure , strange under such circumstances , increased when the driftwood began its play of blue and green and vermilion . Time , our ally , had come to my side already , setting up old images afresh in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stop it . No , I was willing , even in the new hour , to allow the necessary erasure . I understood my willingness , and did not resent it or inwardly rail at it . I became aware , or permitted myself to become aware , that this assertion could only be the not-to-be-denied sexuality of a man , the part of  | him that knows all , can not tell a lie , and , nevertheless , has no conscience . Pliny vouches it . I would not deny it , even if it were worth a denial . Nor did I deny it to myself then , at that hour when , according to my plan of life , all things were to be set aside for the everlasting funeral of my only comrade . Rain , fire and the other fragrance ? fragrance of that other female thing  --  these joined in the irresistible harmony , as they had joined before now , and in this very room time and again , in joy and hope and sorrow , until there was neither joy nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , a loyalty I myself had created , and which , I had sworn in the pride of my grief , should never cease , even if it were fealty to a shade . The consciousness ! Flashing upward , gliding in strength like a green shark twisting out of the blue , came the thought , so powerful that I muttered it to the flames . " What if he 's not dead ? " I stood up with my face to the mantel , not daring to turn . I saw that my wine and cup had been placed there . I drank the wine off in a violent swallow and turned to look at her . She had not left her place . She had drunk the way I had . Surely she must have dashed it to her mouth ; for I saw , when she turned , a red drop at the sagging corner . She gazed into the empty glass ; now lifted her hand and struck the back of it against the slipping drop , making a rosy smear on mouth and hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the soiled hand . She seemed confused and vexed . I said : " Come here , Laurie . Come to the fire . " She did so at once and stood by my side . I drew the white handkerchief from my breast pocket and wiped away mouth stain and hand stain . Her acceptance of this attention made some difference in me . Both acceptance and obedience were slight , but it is the way of a man to give undue meaning to the most insignificant responses in a woman . An undeniable elation rose within me ; and this , very quickly , took the shape of hope . All this while I dabbed at her stained hand . All this foolishness . Because , when I had done , her hand left mine in such a sickly fall that I knew she had not been deeply aware either of my word or act . I said : " I will tell you the story , Laurie . I would n't want you to hear it from anybody else . It is worse than you have imagined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean  --  would have been a harsh thing to bear . But he died by the hand of another . Abel was murdered , dear . Murdered . " At this merciless but required beginning , the dark blood  | left her face in such a swift drain that even the unsightly shadows under her eyes became paler . This was all that I could dare to say at the beginning . I had the courage to tell her that much , but not enough to tell whose hand had been lifted on the deck of the Mara . She did not shrink from me . Yet there was a perceptible movement away , which I studied with concern because I knew too well that the bearer of such sad tales does himself no good among his hearers . I paused and asked myself : " Is she hearing me ? The gale is making such a racket aloft . " In leaving her place by the fire , she took my hand and led me to a cushioned chair near the couch . She lay down on the couch and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she took my hand in hers and clenched her fingers . The roughness of her fingertips surprised me so greatly that I looked down at her hand . The nails were stained and some were broken . The fingertips were stained and had little scars on them . I told her then of the first rude hail that had come across the water when we spoke the Mara on that bitter day . I repeated mournfully and loudly that question mournfully flung to us on our deck : " You see anything of Abel Delahanty ? " In repeating that question , its idiocy and cruelty struck me so hard that I became violent within . My voice shook . I kept my eyes on the fire . When I looked at her again , her lips were quivering and the lids , weighty and pale , were coming down over her eyes . I waited for their final closing because that which they hid under blue veins had become unbearable . There was no need of greenhorn explanation to her . She had once been a sailing master in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something you slept on in comfort . Because of this , I could straightly recite whole passages from Will O'Malley 's testimony , and be as sure of her understanding as I was of my own memory . It seemed strange to me that even as I came around to the naming of Stephen , my ungovernable self fought for a life of its own . Yammered for liberty of speech and of recollection . To which I calmly yielded . I pleased that part of me with old images of her , at the helm of the Wild Rose and sailing on the very Bank of which I spoke . This being in the times when we raced our best against the Lunenbergers . She , the ship 's boy , in white duck trousers and pigtails flying , and saying Aye , sir , this and Aye , sir , that in our old-fashioned man-o ' - warsman style . Yes , beneath the loud din of my voice against the gale upon the skylight , I remembered well that time when the no'theaster burst upon us that day and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And while the schooner capered on the edges of vast seas , I came upon her straddled between the dorynests and singing , chanting a wild , wordless song , her eyes closed then as now . Only , then in ecstasy .  | " It was Will O'Malley 's voice , " I said , " that we heard in the accusation , and it was Will O'Malley 's writing that named the man . And the name of that man was Stephen Delahanty . It was he who struck Abel and sent him to his death , Laurie . " Why should I have feared that this revelation should hold a high meaning to her ? I was wrong . She made no response . She did not open her eyes ; neither did the fingers , twisted in mine , become more or less firm . What difference did it make to her ? No name , no word could alter the fact of death . The accusation had a meaning to me only because it gave me something  --  a man to blame and to hate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had always been without rancor . Hate , blame , revenge , and sinful anger ? " You 'll die for it ! " ? nothing of this in her . I had not even the slightest change in the set of her darkened lips , where her teeth showed in the gleam , to tell me that this was so . Nevertheless , I knew it . " She had no reason to hate , " I thought , and at once , out of our past came her own voice replying to my words : " I can not help loving you , Laurie . There is no reason why I should . Because you can not love me . Yet I love you and I always shall . " And from her : " Love requires no reason . It is wrong , Mark , to look for a reason for love or for the absence of love . It is Abel whom I must love , but even to myself I can not give a reason and I have long ago given up the search for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , " I said to myself as I went on with my story of Stephen 's explanation , " and now it is to him that you must say goodbye . Whatever you meant to say to him tonight when he came off the Mara , and whatever he said to you that brought you across the sea , it all comes down to this : Goodbye ! ' " I wonder what did happen between you ? But I can not ask you now because I must go on with this story of his death . He mystified me when he said he had not spoken to you in Paris . I had a vision of him coming near you and then leaving you , and I knew that the idea of you had become sad to him , and Michael said : That one has gone wild in Paris ! ' Now I see that I was wrong ! For you two had become joined again and I would have been glad of it  --  I swear that ! ? but it is all gone now . Unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you  | will have no other , that the first shall be last . Have you , too , pledged yourself to a ghost ? Beware of such promises to an illusion , Laurie ! I said such a thing to myself , and swore it , yet even now , in only a little while of time , my plan of life has been altered by the sight of you and I long for you above all other peace and all other sad joy . I will press after you . I can not help it ! Before I go , I shall make you repeat the kiss with which you greeted me and I shall come here tomorrow to comfort you , but I shall do more . More ! You will not escape me now ! Even now , this very moment , when I have not yet told you all you must hear . At the merest sign from you I would  --  ah ! I will lie to you ! I will ! I will ! Not even he shall stop me ! " I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . The eyes appeared and began to reflect the firelight ; then the inner reflection increased and darkened the glow caused by the firelight . I believed that she had been disturbed by the secret violence of thought behind the screen of words . She was capable of saying , " Stop your talking and tell me of what you are thinking . " She did not do so . When I paused , she drove me on with a slight pressure of the fingers . Someone rapped at the door . A man . I heard the clear knock of his knuckles . I moved forward in the chair . She detained me , gave me by the pressure of her hand a signal that she did n't care who it might be . The knock came again . I heard men 's voices beyond . I put her hand down by her side and walked to the door . There I listened . I heard the voices above the drip of rain and creaking caused by the wind . I heard Michael say , " Try it again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night . " Stephen asked : " Are you sure you saw a light ? " " A faint one . Knock again . Sing out . " The gale blew some of their words away . Stephen had refused to knock again or to call to her . I heard him say : " I hate to face her alone . " " I 'll come with you . Why should you hate to face her ? She ca n't blame you for it . Why should you worry about her ? What was he to her ? " " Everything ! " " I 'm not so sure . " " I am , Michael . " They went away . I went back to her . I said : " That was Stephen and Michael . Came to tell you what I am telling you . They will come back tomorrow . Do you hear me , Laurie ? I heard them talking outside your door . I  | would n't let them in . Because they are  --  why , they 're talking amongst themselves in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  after all  --  Abel may be alive . That he escaped death . " At this , her lips opened and a groan rushed out of them . She twisted her whole body away and brought her hands together in a gesture of woe . Her eyes had left mine ; now , in a tortured , twisted straining of her head , she looked at me again and I saw that my last words had given her the one thing I did not wish to give her : an unfounded hope . I had not meant even to mention this other illusion . This lie  --  on what did it rest ? Only on the quality of Abel 's laughter when he plunged into the sea . Only on that , and on a phrase wildly uttered . If it had been uttered at all . More likely that laughter had been the shriek of a man whose jaw-bone had burst . Who were they to come to her and fill her with hope when there was no reason for it ? My anger against them took shape again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepare her against their lie . " That Abel escaped ! So he told me in the cabin of the Medea , Laurie , but he had nothing  --  nothing ! ? to support his hope and he will have nothing more to tell you tomorrow when he comes here . When he told that part of his story to us , Michael asked him if it was true laughter or ironic laughter . That was drawing it too fine , I can tell you ! And yet the other , Stephen , replied that he was sure that the laughter was true laughter . By which he meant that Abel , even then , had taken the blow as sort of a joke . A way out for him ! And those were the words they put into his broken mouth ! Yes , Stephen testified that Abel cried out : The way to go ! ' As if he could hear such words and understand their delicate meaning in all that hurly-burly , the men shouting and the racket of the squall and the torches going . Madness ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's brain . Remorse has driven him to this trickery and will drive him to worse ! " I repeated Will O'Malley 's words : that Abel had cried out like a man gone mad . And said : " He heard that . And heard no words . " She lay quiet again . Only once did she plead to me with her pleading eyes , and I knew that in her grief she yearned to have me return again in my speech and find for her a true reason to uphold their frightfulness . But I would not . I turned my eyes toward the fire and , while I spoke , the picture of my old dorymate screaming in the jolt of pain and the coming of death  --  the image rose before me of his eyes straining in horror and his mouth beseeching , and once again  --  only this time redoubled  --  the agony of his plunge seized my heart and I  | swung away from her , away from her grief , and fell headlong with him , headlong and bloody , into the darkness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Smothered ! " The word beat like a gong within me and I could not help striking at my throat because I seemed to be without air to breathe . I ran from the house .  | 15 I AWOKE in the middle of the night . Not easily , as our habit is at sea , where the awakening is calm , whether to answer a hasty call from the watch or a routine summons to the helm . No , I came back roughly to the world with my heart beating so hard that in the first moments I heard it in the summer stillness . The room lay touched and barred serenely by the moonlight . I listened . The wind had n't changed ; it blew from the west and beat the apple boughs in the gentlest way . I had not been dreaming , and I was grateful ( to what or whom ? ) that I had had no dreams . I had dreamed too often and too violently of late and wished to have no more of it . I said : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And : " Do n't wake the house now . You 've slept the clock around , Mother says . " " I 'm glad to hear it . " He had been standing against the door . He had apparently opened it , closed it softly , and had then called to me in my sleep . " I 've brought you up a bottle of ale . Thought you might be thirsty after your kink . " " I 'm thirsty and hungry . I was all in , Michael . " " I can understand it . I 'm half dead on my feet , myself . Listen , Mark ! " " Aye ! " " Take it a little easy , will you ? " " In what way , easy ? With you ? " " Yes , with me . With  --  oh , with all of us . There 's a good deal going on . Much has happened . " He filled a glass with ale and held it out to  | me . I drank off the foam and half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Easy does it and I 'll take it easy . I 'll do anything you say , Michael , except two things : I 'll not shake his hand nor will I go to see her again . " " And you call that taking it easy ? How do you know I have n't turned you out in the middle of the night to ask you to take his hand and then go to see her ? ' Twould n't be taking it easy , would it , if that was the case ? " He at once added : " But it is n't , Mark , it is n't . " " I 'll take back what I said . I forgot once that you are my brother ? " " Aye , " he whispered quickly , " and your skipper , too ! " " Yes , I forgot that . In my anger , I forgot two things that mean everything to me . I sha n't do it again . I 'll say it over  --  about Stephen and Laurie . Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take his hand now , and I wo n't go to see her now . Later , we 'll see . " " That 's more like it . It 's what we need . To take it easy . But you will be called upon to do more . Soon . And in a strange way . " " More ? " I looked at him inquiringly . Perhaps nervously . " Yes . I depend on you . Not only on your wisdom , Mark , but also upon your charity . It was your common charity to all men that bound you and Abel . Now we must draw upon it again . " He lifted his hand in the shadows and whispered , " Oh , not to excess . ' T is nothing that you would n't willingly do . Upon reflection , I mean . " I could n't see his face clearly ; and I much needed the guidance which , by long practice , it usually afforded me . " I 'll turn on the light , Michael . " I stretched out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hey ? What 's that ? " " No , Mark . Not the light . Not yet , Mark . If you please . " I did n't withdraw my hand from the lamp at once . Surprise held it there . I said , " Very well , " and lay wondering in the dark . " Tell me , " I said , " has Stephen seen her ? Has he told her his story ? " " Yes . " " And you ? Were you there ? " " Yes . " " Well , did she speak ? What did she say ? " " Let me tell you that later . " " All right . But tell me this : did she send word to me ? Does she believe his story ? " " Later , Mark , later . " He said no more , but I could tell by the change in his expression  | that he had been impressed by her . She had not proved to be the wilful , passionate child that she had once been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in our talk , he had put on a cynical air or one that was forthrightly hostile . I was aware that he had once been jealous of her inflexibility , of her successful rebellion . Now , so far as I could see in the changing bars of moonlight , he had a less flippant air . She had given him cause for thoughtfulness , either by her words and actions or by a lack of these . He said : " Yes , I 'll speak to you about her later . " " Very well . I sha n't let you forget , Michael . Mind that ! " He replied with an energy that astonished me : " I sha n't forget ! You wo n't have to remind me . No , it wo n't be easy to forget her and what I learned . " Seeing his lack-lustre face , and conjecturing what he might have experienced under her staring eyes , I let it go and said no more . He drew the chair halfway down the bedside and seated himself there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long since I had found him so tired-looking . He said : " You came home night before last and turned in . I did n't come home . Not all day . Not until now . I 'm stupid from talking , talking , and running around . I say that so you 'll understand if I seem a little thick . " He paused here and then murmured in a way not easy to hear . " You 'll understand what has happened to him now . Part of it at any rate . " " The newspapers ? " He struck his hands together in a gesture of pain . " Ah , yes ! I thought  --  hoped , rather  --  that that end of it might pass off in a sort of routine way . You know , a schooner returning with her colors half-mast and two men lost at sea . It happens often enough . But they were too smart for us on that score . They remembered the Sable Island story well enough . I suppose it was a natural thing to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was quite a natural thing . And proper enough . From any point of view . " He went on : " Stephen was out of it . They could n't find him . " " Where was he ? " " Here , of course . Where else ? " " Ohl " " He stayed in my room most of the time . " " Is he there now ? " " No. "  | " Where is he then ? " He held up his hand and said : " Wait now , Mark . I 'll come to that presently . Let me tell you this much : that the full story was told by all the dorymen who saw it  --  who saw what happened . They had to tell it , of course . No one wished to stop them . And the upshot of it is that the general opinion  --  the public opinion  --  is that there was an accident . Everything necessary was put before them . " " Will O'Malley 's testimony ? " " I ca n't say . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know ? I placed it in your hands . ' T was meant for the skipper . For you . He brought it to you because you were a captain . More or less a witness . And a person of authority . Legal authority . " " I did my duty as a captain . You may be sure of that , Mark ! " " What did you consider your duty to be in this instance ? You still have it ? " " The paper ? No ! I gave it to the Captain of the Port . That 's what I meant by my duty as a skipper . In such matters , I am responsible to him . He has the jurisdiction . It would have been incorrect for me to keep it from him . " " Much as you wanted to ? " " Yes , much as I wanted to . " " What was his opinion ? Of that one paper , I mean . " " Had that been the only testimony , I rather think his opinion would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are now , Mark . I can tell you that . " Here he paused , not in tiredness or confusion , but quite deliberately . His phrase , " as they are now , " had been uttered in a tone of relief ; and this emotion let in another . One that I could n't size up . He rose and walked to the seaward window-seat , and stood there looking out over our pathway to the Banks . He did n't look in idleness . No , he made a customary estimate of wind , tide , and sky . He seemed satisfied . I repeated : " Things as they are . ' By that you can only mean that things are all right . From your standpoint . There will be no court of inquiry . No trial . " " None . Will O'Malley 's story was the most orderly of them all . But every man aboard the Mara had his story to tell . They were all on deck . " " Yes , all hands had been called . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that none of the other stories agreed entirely with Will 's . Most of the dorymen had seen the blow struck by Abel . That seemed to carry the most weight . The decisive weight . So there 's an end to it . "  | " Legally speaking . " " Yes , legally speaking . " " Then tell me , Michael , why do you come here in the middle of the night to tell me this ? What do you expect me to do ? " " I want you to accept this decision , Mark . " " I will . If that is what you want , I will accept . There 's nothing that I can do . Nothing I wish to do . Nothing I need to do . I 've already made the other decision , which is the important one . The one that has no legal standing . The one that has a moral sense . Not that my making it is important . No ! These are not made by the mind . As you yourself have said  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the true law . Captain Delahanty is condemned . And if he lives to be ninety ? he is still condemned . Because he had murder in his heart . ' T is the law of the old Jews and must stand forever . " I paused and then let out the last word in a louder voice , " Retribution ! " " I will repay , saith the Lord . ' He bent his head over the awful text . The breaking of his voice in his next words made me shudder . I rolled out of the bed and cried out : " Michael ! Michael ! " He repeated his summons : " It has begun ! Come here ! Come here ! " I went to the window . Between the sea wall of the orchard and the moon  --  the middle moon of August  --  a moonglade stretched . A goldened pathway to the east . In it a schooner rode , her bow moonward , , her beauty doubled by moonlight . Her white topmasts shone , her trees across the beaming face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under head-masts ; these now held her in the tide . Her lights poured out gaudy streams , crimson and green , into the glade . As ever , the beauty of our sister entranced me , made me forgetful , touched me lightly with a familiar joy . So the heart responds , even to the thousandth time , even in grief . She filled the night air with the sound and music of her name , and by her glory split asunder the glory of the sea . She made her appeal to moon and stars , her witnesses , and to the green tide urging her , ruffling her away . The wind lay fair for her ; yet she tarried between wind and tide . I heard the chanting far away , the chant of her recessional , yet she tarried in the pathway . Between the helm and break , a lantern gleamed , held in a man 's hand . Its round light glowed into the tide like a golden eye seeking a  | treasure . In passing to the windward rail , the holder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward . " His colors ! At half mast again . " " Aye , and there he 'll keep them . They were taken down by someone against his orders . " I cried out again : " His dories ! The nests are empty . " " He carries none . He has no need of dories for what he must do . " " Then he believes ! He believes his own story . " " Aye ! He repeats it over and over , Blue is alive ! He lives ! If it were not so , how could I live and breathe ? ' He believes it even in his terrible dreams and cries out , Where are you , brother ? Oh , Abel ! Abel ! ' " " And you , Michael ? " " I do n't believe it . You have said it . Abel feeds the salt . Nevertheless , Stephen must go . Must seek him . You understand that . " " Yes . " I gazed at the lantern . It had come to rest on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into mine with such a living intensity that all of that vessel 's beauty fled and she became a thing of terror to me . Even in the moment that this change took place , the golden eye blinked under a dash of spray , and the eye henceforth seemed to beseech me , seemed to be a plea . " Why does n't he go ? If he must go . " A fear twisted in me . I cried out : " Why does he linger then ? That light ! " " He must go , Mark , but he can not go until you say to me that you will forgive him . You struck him . Your hand struck him where Abel 's did . Now the law has judged him and has let him go . But you are above the law to him . As you are to me . You are Abel . " Michael seized me by the arm . " You may never see him again , Mark . Give him what he requires . Think ! That is only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much older than you . Once you loved him . As I do now . As you loved Abel . Let him go ! " " Yes ! " " Ah , that 's all that 's needed . " " But how , Michael ? " " The light . " " The light ? " " Aye ! Mark . He is watching for it . " I turned , half blinded , and stretched out my hand . The lamp blazed . So did the golden eye on the deck below the wall ; then it went out . I heard a great shout from the deck : " Hey ! Hey ! " Her foresail ran toward the stars . She glided into the pathway . I heard voices rise  | again . Her mainsail leaped toward the moon and she answered gently . Her topsails flowed above her trees . She sailed along the moonglade ; her whitening wake cast off opal furrows . Under the black sail I saw her helmsman leaning black-clad against her wheel . He turned once . His face gleamed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he raised his hand before he turned to his sails again . To his sail and to the colors now shining in its darkness . She slid beyond the moon and became a shadow yonder . Nevertheless , I watched until I heard the dirge music playing for her louder and louder , until Time , in its eternal ebb and flow , ever remembering , ever repeating , sang the chant of ages past , the hymn of endless conflict , of black regret and bitterness . Ye children of the sea ! Children of the sea ! All chanting and all pealing waned to silence ; and in the silence I heard a childish voice repeating : " ' Intreat me not to leave thee , or to return from following after thee . . : "
