Soldiers of the Allied armies in France were ready last week to salute the humbler military men who have followed in their wake cleaning up their wreckage : SHAEF 's civil-affairs officers ( G5 in the U.S. Army 's general staff divisions ) . In helping to revive the normal life of a battered France they had proved to be a real military asset . The people of France hailed them as saviors . <P> G-5 had made a good record in Italy . In France the record was even better . The officers had luck . French crops were good . The retreating Germans had had no time to drain off France 's food resources , had even left behind thousands of tons of their own supplies . Quick action on the part of the F.F.I , forestalled the destruction by Germans of water , light and sewage systems . But there was still a vast and complicated job to do when G-5 arrived on the heels of the fighting armies . <P> Heaven Helps Those . Frenchmen themselves pitched in with a will . G-5 teams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the engineers . <P> G-5 revived Cherbourg 's waterworks by sending damaged turbo-electric units to England to be rewound , moved 60 tons of coal from Courcelles to Creully to stoke a pasteurization plant and relieve a desperate milk shortage . G-5 teams carted diesel fuel into the Bayeux district to get flour mills going . <P> G-5 organized the burial of thousands of dead horses and cattle , turned over to farmers horses captured from the Germans , moved 4,000 refugees from the Caen area to the Cherbourg suburbs , imported medical supplies for Caen 's wounded civilians . <P> In Paris , isolated by three months of air bombardment which had destroyed practically every means of outside communication , G-5 teams helped get wrecked power lines working again , helped clear the Seine of broken bridges and sunken barges so that coal and wheat can be brought in by water . Last week G-5 was able to report that 3,800 tons of food were reaching Paris daily . This was 600 tons short of what Paris needed and Parisians were in for a cold , lean winter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To the U.S. Army the Paris Prefect sent his thanks and " the living gratitude of the population . " <P> No Kicks . Operating boss of this cleanup job is slow-talking , 52-year-old Brigadier General Frank Johnson McSherry , who was born in El Dorado Springs , Mo. , fought in World War I , in 1942 served in Washington as director of operations for tRe War Manpower Commission . <P> McSherry traveled in the wake of war across Italy ( although he got out in front of it at Naples and innocently rolled into that city ahead of the first combat units ) . A see-for-myself kind of boss , he now bounces back &; forth across the Channel , up &; down the map of France , traveling without fuss or feathers , hitching rides rather than put anyone to any trouble . Last week he caught a ride to Lyons in Major General Ralph Royce 's private plane and luxuriated in a cushioned seat . Bucket seats in a transport are the cheerful McSherry 's usual lot . <P> More often than not he is apt to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bedroll he generally carries with him .
