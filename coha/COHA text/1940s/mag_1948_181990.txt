( See Cover ) <P> It was a curious anticlimax . Republicans had waited for years for the great day when the country would come to its senses and turn the Democrats out . The authors of the New Deal , in turn , had shuddered in anticipation of the awful moment when the G.O.P. would come to power , reduce their works to ashes , and set the laboring man to building country clubs on non-union wages . <P> But by this week , when the day seemed surely at hand , the G.O.P. had embraced most of Franklin Roosevelt 's innovations . And the New Dealers had either grown bald and tired or had disappeared completely , leaving their party to less feverish - and less consecrated-men . <P> The Protocol . As the 1948 campaign drew to its close , it was evident that it had induced a curious reaction . The most energetic efforts of two major and three minor candidates had apparently either soothed , dulled or completely anesthetized the electorate . <P> This did not mean that the U.S. citizen had lost his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would take his gold fillings unless he guarded them with his life . In general , he had been determined to vote against somebody or something ever since the two big party conventions last summer . Having made his decision , he had then subsided into comparative , not to say lethargic , calm . <P> He had his reasons for refusing to get excited . Few voters believed that there would be any contest on Election Day . Two out of three , according to a Gallup poll last week , thought New York 's Governor Thomas E. Dewey could not possibly be beaten . Moreover , the electioneering had not developed into the kind of nerve-jangling jihad to which the country had grown accustomed since 1932 . <P> The candidates had faithfully observed campaign protocol . The men who sought the most important position in the world had-just like their predecessors-embraced babies , shaken hands with costumed Indians , and posed unflinchingly with fish and stuffed donkeys . <P> But few campaign buttons had blossomed on the nation 's lapels . There had been no attempts to distribute scurrilous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice of the C.I.O. Political Action Committee had fallen off to a scarcely heard murmur . Democrats ( who except for Harry Truman , were sure they would lose ) and Republicans ( who were sure they would win ) displayed the utmost reluctance to contribute funds . The campaigns cost more than ever ( price of a two-week transcontinental tour : $50,000 ) , but the war chests of both parties had been all but empty for weeks . <P> There would be last-minute appeals and a low blow or two , just before the bell . ( This week Truman hinted that Dewey is a " front man " for fascism , and likened him to Hitler . ) In an effort to inject some commotion , both parties revived the old-time torchlight procession . Harry Truman began the week with a monster rally in Chicago , where Boss Jake Arvey 's minions kindled enough flame and fireworks to burn down the whole town . Tom Dewey , after another dash through the Midwest , would conclude his campaign at a Madison Square Garden rally which would be heralded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
