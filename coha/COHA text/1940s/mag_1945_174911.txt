For years the Vanadium Corp . of America jogged along in its own quiet way , all but unknown to the public . Last week it was blasted into the limelight . Vanadium is one of the chief suppliers to the atomic bomb project . <P> Vanadium Corp . was established in 1907 . <P> Ever since , its engineers have poked into the earth 's crust in search of deposits of vanadium , tungsten , chromium and other rare metals . In Peru it controls the world 's largest vanadium deposits , and a leaching plant nearly three miles above sea level . <P> It owns smaller mines at Naturita , Colo. , and at Monticello , Utah . <P> In 1935 the company got a new president , stocky , pink-jowled Edwin Dagobert Bransome . No engineer , Bransome pulled the company out of a financial hole . It promptly earned a profit of $152,000 , Vanadium 's first in six years . By 1944 Bransome was able to report to his stock holders that Vanadium had cleared $459,00 on gross sales of $16 million . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would discuss neither his company nor its future . But investors would no longer ignore it : in three days after Hiroshima was bombed , Vanadium 's stock was pushed up from $25to $33 ? a share . Next day it went down to $28 ? as speculators took their profits .
