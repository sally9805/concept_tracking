txt The Department of Markets will resume tomorrow a policy carried out when Office of Price Administration control was in effect by sending inspectors throughout the city to make zone surveys of meat price fluctuations . Commissioner Eugene G. Schulz said inspectors will be dispatched to each of the five , boroughs for the price check that was dropped with the end of OPA restrictions . At the same time he declared that no shortage of meat supplies exists in this area to account for high , prices . Any falling off in retail buying , the Commissioner noted , was a result of seasonal conditions , as well as consumer resistance to high prices . Because wholesale meat prices are customarily established Thursday , for week-end retail buying , there was no change in this respect . Following . a policy enunciated Friday by Joseph T. Sharkey. vice chairman of the City Council , Councilman Eugene P. Connolly charged yesterday that " an artificial meat crisis is being created by irresponsible , greedy and anti-social meat interests . " He announced that he would introduce a resolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meat situation . Mr. Conu.olly also declared that meat prices are 25 per cent higher than they were under OPA price controls . No reply had been received yesterday at City Hall to the telegram sent by Mayor O'Dwyer on Fr/day urging Secretary of Agriculture Clinton P. Anderson to take action to relieve the " shocking " ? rise of meat prices . Secretary Anderson said that there was little that he could do directly to bring about lower prices , , but he thought there would be an adjustment soon . Similarly , there is little the City Administration can do directly to influence prices , but Mr. Connolly will ask that funds be appropriated for the investigation and that the Council fully use its power of subpoena to make a sweeping investigation " to the end that the most vigorous steps possible may be taken at the earliest possible date to curb the rise in meat prices , and to restore such prices to a sane and reasonable level . " Mr. Connolly 's resolution will ask that local and Federal grand juries be apprised of the Council 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belief that the situation points to a conspiracy to violate the anti-trust laws . In the face of rising prices throughout the city , the Fort Greene Place Market , Brooklyn , one of the largest retail establishments in the ' city , maintained prices that have obtained during the last two weeks . This market , which attracted large crowds by its well-stocked refrigerators and counters during rationing , has resumed the practice of operating its own slaughterhouse . When market conditions became more normal , it was not profitable to operate independent slaughterhouses because the volume of business did not warrant it . However , since the skyrocketing of priced more and more customers , drawn by low prices , have returned to the Fort Greene Market . For example , sirloin was selling at 65 cents , whereas it was 9 ( cents to $1 a pound generally . Breast of veal was being sold at 20 cents a pound and leg of lamp at 49 cents a pound . The market added ten clerks and next week expects to butcher ten to twelve carloads of beef . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
