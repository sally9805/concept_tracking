" It looked then as if he had received a very bad back injury . They worked on him with oxygen after his arrival at the hospital and I think he 's all right . After all , Bill is tough , and has plenty of guts . I do n't think he 's going to be hospitalized very long . " Mr. Gilbert said he was notifying Chief Justice Fred M.
