Year of Attack ( See Cover ) <P> The little half-naked man on Wotje would not be surprised at the sight of the birds sweeping up from the horizon . For 22 successive days the birds had come , scattering destruction around his coral fortress . But these were new birds , smaller , wheeling towards him in greater swarms , coming down on him in screaming dives . Before the Emperor 's little man burrowed frantically into his coconut and concrete pillbox he would comprehend that the enemy was moving into his Marshall Islands domain for the kill . <P> The new birds had arrived in the morning . On nearby Kwajalein , Jaluit , Maloelap , little bandy-legged men squinted at the Pacific sky and ran for cover . Even over the island of Eniwetok , furthest west of all the Marshalls , the carrier-based planes arrived ( see map , p. 19 ) . The atolls shuddered under the impact of bomb upon bursting bomb and presently the screech and clump of shells added to the din and terror . Out of sight , over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were bringing the little men 's islands under naval gunfire . Long awaited , long expected , the U.S. attack on the Marshalls was developing ( Tokyo hinted that U.S. forces had landed at some points ) . <P> Two months ago a U.S. force of carriers , battleships , cruisers , destroyers , tranports had pounced on the Gilberts , some 500 miles to the south . Then , 2,500 tons of steel had been poured on to the pillboxes and revetments to soften beaches for an amphibious invasion . Even when troops arrived , the defenses were still very hard : Jap resistance to the landings was ferocious , the cost in U.S. lives high . The Marshalls , held by the Japs for a quarter of a century , for years jealously guarded from alien visitors , were an unknown quantity . Involved this week was probably the greatest sea and air force the U.S. has yet concentrated on any Pacific objectives . <P> Paramushiro to the Solomons . Eyes fixed hardest on the Marshalls , Tokyo looked nervously around her whole Pacific frontier . Simultaneously with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north and on the edge of the Jap 's mid-Pacific system . Navy bombers had struck twice at Paramushiro in the Kuril Islands . In New Guinea , U.S. and Australian troops were closing a trap around one Jap force while bombers at tacked the coastal base of Madang . U.S. troops on New Britain had widened their beachhead and Douglas MacArthur 's planes steadily attacked the Admiralty Islands , through which Japan fed the axial base at Rabaul . From new bases in the northern Solomons U.S. planes battered that once-great Jap outpost , destroyed more than 400 Jap planes . Announced U.S. losses : 60 planes . <P> Submarines , operating in the China Sea , hacked at the lifelines which carried coking coal from Indo-China , oil from the East Indies , materials which the Emperor 's war machine must have or stall . Washington announced this week that 14 more Jap ships , including three transports , had fallen victim to the raiders , bringing the submarine score against Jap ships to 422 definitely destroyed . <P> The Commanders .
