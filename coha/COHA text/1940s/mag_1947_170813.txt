U.S. hams ( amateur radio operators ) like to think that they are invaluable 1 ) in disasters , and 2 ) as agents of international good will . Last week the hams had good proof of both contentions : <P> At Lake Success , the United Nations invited the world 's 100,000 hams to be a global network for broadcasting U.N . information to 37 countries . <P> From what remained of the municipal building in blasted Texas City ( see NATIONAL AFFAIRS ) , the voice of a ham station piped into action almost immediately after the first explosion . For the next two days &; nights , the amateur was one of the busiest lines of communication between the charred city and the outside world . <P> Shortly after the first explosion , Veteran Ham B. H. Standley ( W5FQQ ) of Houston rushed to the scene , set up his emergency unit and began transmitting messages . Samples : " Joe Vasquez not expected to live . Is in Room 323 , St. Joseph 's Infirmary Houston . " " To Fort Crockett : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Houston Boilermakers ' Union : please send 50 bottles of oxygen and acetylene Texas City . " <P> While Standley 's first messages were crackling along the Gulf Coast , the hams of STEN ( South Texas Emergency Network ) were given a red alert , went on the air to monitor the messages along to their destinations . In Washington , FCC hastily authorized STEN to use emergency frequency bands . Amateurs all over the U.S. , Bermuda and Puerto Rico stood by to pick up and relay the messages . <P> For some 36 hours Standley broadcast almost continuously . At first , only priority messages ( requests and instructions for Red Cross workers , embalmers , blood donors , etc. ) were handled . Later , he sent and received " personal welfare " transmissions ( inquiries about individuals ) . When the second explosion came at 1:11 a.m . Thursday , Standley flung himself to the floor and went on transmitting in a shower of glass . After 250-odd messages , with the emergency over , dog-tired Standley went off the air and home to bed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hams ? During the war , the armed forces found that they were a ready-made pool of trained communications experts . Since the war , the number of hams in the U.S. has risen to nearly 80,000 operators , with 50,000 stations ( two-thirds of the world total ) . The FCC is now granting over 1,000 new licenses a month . Some predict that within five years there will be 250,000 U.S. hams .
