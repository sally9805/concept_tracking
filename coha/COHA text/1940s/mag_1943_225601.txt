Once before-it was about the time he had pinned the third star on his shoulder - he had packed his kit . But the misfortunes of war sent him back to his old job . Last week Lieut . General Alexander Archer Vandegrift of Guadalcanal and Bougainville packed up again . This time he was really on his way . Where that way would take him is still a Marine secret . His successor as commander of the South Pacific 's Marines : Major General Roy S. Geiger . <P> Thickset , poker-faced , chilly-eyed General Geiger is another Marine 's Marine . He joined up in 1907 as a private , was a second lieutenant in 15 months . He won his first Navy Cross for service in France in World War I , his second ( Gold Star ) for his work as commander of all aviation units on Guadalcanal in the hot time from September to November 1942 . In those 63 days , his command shot down 286 Jap planes , sank six enemy ships , including a heavy cruiser . <P> Professionally , Roy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three services for the kind of command he now holds . A veteran pilot ( since 1916 ) he is especially tops with aviators , still flies his own plane . <P> One day on Guadal , when some of the airmen were griping about the holes in the runway , Geiger walked down to an SBD ( Douglas dive-bomber ) spotted on the apron , climbed in . Without a single escorting fighter , the Old Man took the SBD off the flight strip , flew north to a village where the Japs were headquartered , dropped his 1,000-pounder , went home . His pilots got the idea . <P> On another occasion , the General was asked to loan his personal Catalina flying boat to help PT boats flush a covey of Jap ships . Geiger first refused ( " Got it filled full of holes the last time you fellows flew around out there " ) , finally gave in . But there was a string attached . He insisted on going along as copilot . <P> Beyond this flair for cold-blooded fire-eating , Roy Geiger is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ educated officers , with courses behind him in the Army and Navy war colleges , the Army 's Command and General Staff School . Like airmen , groundling Marines have long since decided that he is a handy man to have around .
