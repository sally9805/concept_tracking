By any Marine 's book , chill-eyed , cool-blooded Colonel Merritt Edson is the Corps 's ideal fighting man , full of military judgment , cold nerve and a complete devotion to his troops . He is the classic professional . <P> On the Solomons , where he commanded a now famed battalion of raiders , 46-year-old Colonel Edson directed his troops with never a flicker of his eyelashes , never a rise in his impersonal voice . Men under fire were braced by his characteristic battle pose : arms folded easily over his lower chest , feet wide apart , eyes darting from under his steel helmet . <P> For what he did on Guadalcanal , Merritt Edson , one of the Corps 's great small-arms experts , won the Congressional Medal of Honor and the British D.S.O. to add to a string of ribbons already long . <P> In the lashing fire of Tarawa marines saw him again . His arms were still folded and his voice was as calm as if he had been sitting at a desk in Washington . <P> Last week marines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senate for confirmation went his appointment as a brigadier general . For most leathernecks ' money , it was about time .
