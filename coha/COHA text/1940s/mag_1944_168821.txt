These porcelain figures are chessmen from the U.S.S.R. , where chess is the most popular indoor sport and chess pieces represent figures in the class struggle . The chained worker is a capitalist pawn . The sinister piece whose head is a grimacing skull is the capitalist king . The rugged collective farmer is a communist pawn . The aproned worker is a communist king . Last week this chess set and over 30 others went on exhibition at Manhattan 's Metropolitan Museum . Many of the pieces , some dating from the 9th Century , were exquisite miniature sculptures in ivory , silver , fine woods . Most of the Metropolitan 's chess show was lent by Chess Collector Gustavus A. Pfeiffer , co-author of Chessmen.
