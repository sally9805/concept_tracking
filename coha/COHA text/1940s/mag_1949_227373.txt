Mother Is a Freshman ( 20th Century-Fox ) is a featherbrained variation on one of Hollywood 's most cherished myths : that U.S. Moms up to the age of 40 should be able , at the drop of a mink stole , to look and act like their teen-age daughters . The plot , as silly as a schoolgirl 's endorsement of a beauty soap , is just about as inventive . <P> Loretta Young is a Park Avenue widow who finds herself temporarily broke . She gets a scholarship to Pointer College , where she joins her pretty daughter ( Betty Lynn ) in pursuit of higher education and a youngish English professor ( Van Johnson ) . With the help of the " Kissing Oak " and other standard campus props , Mother gets her man , and Betty gets compensation in the form of a stripling her own age . <P> Out of this bit of nonsense Director Lloyd Bacon might have squeezed a few touches of light satire or screwball comedy . Instead he has played it cute and coy . The only really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fits her role as snugly as she fits her sweater . The rest , including Rudy Vallee as another pince-nezed fuddy-duddy , is synthetic fluff , which ought to do well in the neighborhood houses by the time hot weather comes . <P> Down to the Sea in Ships ( 20th Century-Fox ) , first filmed in 1922 , was a brawling forerunner of today 's semidocumentary , despite a sugary love story and the presence of Clara ( " the It Girl " ) Bow , who was rolled aboard in a barrel . For the old silent version , Director Elmer Clifton persuaded the citizens of New Bedford , Mass , to supply the cash and most of the cast . Then he chartered a real whaler , and along with his cameramen and a crew of real whaling men , set out for the Caribbean to catch real whales . <P> The new version , directed by documentary-minded Henry Hathaway ( The House on 92nd Street ) , might have been a real humdinger in the same tradition . Unfortunately , it rarely gets much nearer to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some background footage of Pacific whales lazing about off the coast of Southern California . To offset this handicap , canny Skipper Hathaway has concentrated on character study , backed by careful casting and straightforward camera work . <P> The story , which happily bears no resemblance to the 1922 script , concerns three males . On the eve of his last voyage , old Captain Joy ( Lionel Barrymore ) , New Bedford 's No. 1 whaler , faces a dilemma . Should he once again take along his orphaned , sea-struck grandson ( Dean Stockwell ) or leave him ashore to catch up on his book learnin ' ? In Boston-trained Dan Lunceford ( Richard Widmark ) he finds a plot-making compromise . Lunceford , he figures , has enough schooling to keep both a ship and Little Jed 's education afloat . After a slow , landlubberly beginning , the three of them , with Dan as first mate , set sail for the whaling grounds and a few stern lessons in character-building . <P> Down to the Sea is no great picture , but it is tight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moments-notably the harpooning and the ship 's tangle with an iceberg in the fog-have a fast-moving drive and conviction . Despite an occasional whiff of the studio , they have a real sea smell .
