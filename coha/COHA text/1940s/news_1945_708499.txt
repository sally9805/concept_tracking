txt The 400 - yard Ludendorff railroad bridge , spanning the Rhine between Remagen and Erpel , collapsed at 3 o'clock this afternoon , ten days almost to the minute after the United States First Army thwarted the Wehrmacht 's effort to blow it up and stormed across the river . Army officials announced Sunday , however , that the gap could be repaired and that the bridge soon would be in operation again , an Associated Press dispatch said . There was no traffic on the bridge when it collapsed but 200 or more engineering troops were working on it and many of them were hurled into the swift , icy river or crushed by the falling structure  --  possibly the worst episode of accidental casualties of the war . A few hours before the bridge collapsed the Germans executed four officers on charges of cowardice and negligence for having permitted the bridge to be captured intact , the Germans announced Sunday . The collapse was caused by the weakening of the structure by two of the demolition charges that the Germans managed to explode as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and aerial bombing for ten days , but there was no shelling or bombing going on at the time the bridge fell . The collapse does not jeopard1 ize the bridgehead  --  which today ( reached an extent of sixty square miles  --  because additional pontoon bridges have been slung across the river . These , with the railroad bridge , // enabled us to get sufficient forces over to hold and start exploiting the " windfall " bridgehead . It was only three days ago that the United States First Army reported that repairs to the bridge had made it " stronger than when we got it , " which evidently was not true . A special Army investigation into the precise circumstances of the collapse was under way tonight . The consensus of Army officials was the long view that the " bridge has served its purpose " and that all the use we got out of it was velvet . The only casualty figures available tonight were five killed and many others missing from one unit . This is likely to be doubled , at least . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recovered . An inquiry into the involved organizational status of the bridge tonight indicated that jurisdiction over the work on it was divided between at least two Army levels doing different types of construction work and , while no one was eager to charge negligence , no one this correspondent could locate was eager to acknowledge it . The investigation may even conclude that the risk was warranted . Big Girder Gives Way The bridge , whose floor had been planked and plated over by the Germans so that vehicles could use it , was what is technically known as a " continuous arch cantilever " type , with the main supporting steel arch resting on stone piers about 300 feet out from the opposite banks . It was on one of the supporting girders at the base of the east arch that the collapse hinged . This girder had been broken by a German demolition charge , putting a strain for the support of the floor high up on the arch . After numerous shell hits , this point broke without warning and two-thirds of the bridge swung slowly out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the river , pulling the end section of the bridge out of place with it . The center section 's fall bent some parts of the end sections high into the air . Capt . Francis Goodwin of . Buffalo , N. Y .. a construction supply officer , had just left . the bridge and had just driven under it on a motor cycle on a low east bank road when he " heard a sort of swishing . " " As I turned to look the archway crumpled first and then the abutments dropped , " he said . " It must have been 45 seconds before it finished gradually subsiding into the river . I did n't believe it for some time . It did n't seem possible that it could happen after all the work we had put into it under shellfire and bombing . " Captain Goodwin raced across a near-by pontoon bridge instructing the soldiers at both ends to go out on the pontoons and catch any victims drifting downstream . He drove on into Remager on the west bank and sent ambulances to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motorboats he could find down to the wreckage . Staff Sgt. Roger Willett of Lake Charles , La. , who had a platoon of engineers working on the bridge , said : " I was on the far end . I heard a sort of crashing noise . I looked around and it . was gone . " Pfc . Robert McCarthy of Trenton , N. J. , an M. P. stationed at the bridge , said : " I heard something like someone sawing wood and looked up to see the bridge topple into the river . " Two signalmen working at the end of the bridge , Pvts . George Arnold of Oil City , Pa. , and Joe Battista , of Pence , Wis. , tapped a wire and called for medical help . Brooklyn Colonel Rescued The swirling current fifty feet below the original floor level bridge was immediately dotted with struggling men . Others were trapped among the twisted girders . On top of the still standing piers lay both injured and dead . The severed calf of a man 's leg lay in the dusty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beam . The river split the rescue work . All personnel on both banks raced to the river and began throwing ropes to the survivors and clambering out on the wreckage , much of it projecting above the water , helping the injured . Boats raced up and down the river , occasionally capsizing , and on the pontoon bridge men battled with poles against the drifting wreckage . Lieut . Col. Clajton Rust of Brooklyn , in charge of one engineer unit , was hurled into the wreckage but he broke free and was picked up by a boat downstream . The commander of the other engineer unit on the bridge , Lieut . Col. Kenneth Fields of Newton Highlands , Mass. , escaped injury , but a major commanding a battalion of railroad specialists was killed . Acetylene torches were used to cut away the wreckage at the ends of the bridge . A small crane was run out on a downstream pontoon bridge to haul out the heavy wreckage before it shoved the bridge out of place . The whole thing was over in about one hour and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battalions , working on the bridge under corps headquarters , said their work had been confined to the maintenance of the roadway in good enough condition so that vehicles could cross and that the railroad specialist battalion , working under First Army headquarters , had been repairing the basic structure of the bridge .
