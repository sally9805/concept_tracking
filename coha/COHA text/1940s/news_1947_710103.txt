School districts , such : as New York City , which have a $2,000 minimum and have increased teacher salaries by $300 or more since June 30 , 1945 , would receive the option under the committee 's proposal of using their share of new State money for further teacher pay rises or to reimburse themselves for increases previously granted . In transmitting the committee 's report and recommendations to the Legislature , Governor Dewey stated that he would follow it with an emergency message next Monday so that bills carrying out - the proposals could be approved soon after that time .. Dewey Lauds Committee He commended the members of the committee for the- time and effort they devoted to the study of the teacher pay problem . . The committee consisted of Senator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Speaker Oswald D. Heck of the Assembly ; Dr. Francis T. Spaulding , State Commissioner of Education ; John E. Burton , State Budget Director , and Charles D. Breitel , counsel to the Governor . The committee emphasized that its recommendations were " strictly of an emergency character " to meet critical conditions caused by increased living costs and the need for recruiting and retaining competent teachers . If approved next week , as is expected , the committee 's program could go into effect at once . If necessary local action is taken , teachers can receive the full amount of any monthly increase in their final January checks . Because of the heavy Republican majorities in the Senate and Assembly , it is believed almost certain that the committee 's recommendations will be approved by the Legislature by next Tuesday . Bills to give effect to the proposals were introduced in both houses today and are scheduled to come up Monday . The Democratic minorities in both branches , which are committed to more generous treatment of the teachers , are expected to make a fight for larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it will be a futile campaign . Assembly Democrats indicated their line of attack after the report was filed . Leonard Farbstein of Manhattan called the proposals " too little and too late . " Irwin Davidson and William T. Andrews said that the amount involved " does n't half approach the needs " and suggested that the $202,000,000 New York to Buffalo throughoway be postponed to provide additional funds . Irwin Steingut , minority leader , asserted that the $2,000 minimum recommended was not as much as domestics get in private employment . The Democratic attack on the educational proposals followed unanimous passage in the assembly of Mr. Dewey 's bill providing a $25,000,000 appropriation to complete the State 's emergency housing program for veterans . The final vote was preceded by Democratic assertions that the housing program was inadequate . A. similar attack was made in the Senate yesterday before it approved the measure , which goes to the Governor for signature . Assemblyman Wheeler Milmoe of Madison , chairman of the Education Committee , described the teacher report as excellent . For thousands of up-State teachers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of $800 annually . Under existing law the minimum for teachers in schools having , eight or more teachers is $1,600 and in schools with less than eight , $1,200 . In New York City , as a result of recent increases granted by the city , the minimums are $2,208 in elementary schools ; $2,640 in for high and $2,748 in high schools . ' There are 35,000 teachers in New ' York City . Some Republican opposition on the ground that the amount provided is too low is also expected . Senator William F. Condon of Westchester and Assemblyman Lewis W. 011iffe of Brooklyn , both Republicans , said in a joint statement that temporary measures were insufficient . They asked for immediate action on their bill almost to double State aid , which amounts to $126,000,000 a year . Assemblyman Leo P. Noonan , Cattaraugus Republican , sponsored three bills to establish a state-wide $2,500 minimum . One relates to cities of 50,000 or more population ; another to cities between 5,000 and 50,000 , and the third to all other school districts . Bills introduced in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Milmoe to carry out the committee recommendations set a state-wide minimum of $2,000 a year and require that all regular teachers receive an increase of at least $300 over the amounts they were getting on June 30 , 1945 . Substitute Teachers Excluded They also call for additional state aid for - each school district for the calendar year 1947 and for the first three months of 1948 at the rate of $300 annually for each full time teacher or other member of the school instructional staff regularly employed by the district . Supplemental aid , where needed , is further provided to insure that all teacher salaries are brought up to $2,01 ) 0 a year . The measures are worded so as to exclude substitutes , even though employed on what amounts to a full-time basis , in computing the amounts payable to individual districts . This exclusion is expected to work to the disadvantage of New York City and Buffalo , where a large number of substitutes are serving full time . Substitutes , even when working on a full-time basis , are also exempted from the $2,000 minimum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be to force the New York City Board of Education to use part of the money it will receive when the bill becomes law to increase substitute ' pay rather than -- use it all to give a further increase of $300 a year to regular teachers . As the law is drafted , the city would be free to use the additional money for this purpose , or for replenishment of the general fund of the city , should it so desire . In drafting its recommendations , the committee considered the substitute problem in New York and Buffalo , but decided that it could not draft a State-wide law that would meet all the variations of substitute procedure and ' pay scales in different parts of the State .
