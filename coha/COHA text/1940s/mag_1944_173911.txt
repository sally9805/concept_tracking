Admiral Sir Walter Henry Cowan , Bart . was awarded the Distinguished Service Order last week for " gallantry , determination and undaunted devotion to duty as liaison officer with the Commandos . " The Admiral stands 5 ft. 2 in. , and this is his second D.S.O. He won his first on the Nile , 46 years ago , when Horatio Herbert Kitchener , later Earl of Khartum , was fighting the Mahdi . The Admiral is now 73 . <P> In 1939 the weathered old sea eagle had been retired eight years . He told the Admiralty : " I want to die on a battlefield-not in bed . " Said the Admiralty : " Too old . " Eventually he was given an assignment deemed suitable for a superannuated sailor-as liaison officer to the Mediterranean commander Admiral Sir Andrew Browne Cunningham . Sir Walter , still alarmed by the risk of dying in bed , got Cunningham to assign him to the Commandos , to train Commando-men in handling small boats . <P> In one Commando show , at Bardia , Sir Walter fell in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flayed a stalwart young officer who , mistaking him for Major Evelyn Waugh ( Vile Bodies ) , tried to extricate him in the darkness . In Rommel 's sudden thrust at Bir Hacheim in 1942 , Sir Walter was captured . For 16 months he was a prisoner . Then Italy 's collapse released him and gave him a chance to win his second D.S.O. <P> At Mt . Ornito in Italy Sir Walter laboriously helped a badly wounded colonel , far bigger than himself , across a thousand yards of rocky ground under heavy fire to an aid station . At the islands of Solta , Mljet and Brac off the Dalmatian coast his " utter contempt for artillery and mortar fire had a very valuable and steadying effect and won for him the respect and devotion of the men of the Commandos " - as well it might . Heirless Sir Walter was old enough to be their grandfather .
