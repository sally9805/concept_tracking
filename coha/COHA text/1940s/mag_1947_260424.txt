Army &; Navy brass hats , who had been nervously fingering their temporary wartime stars ever since V-J day , were feeling a little starchier last week . In the last-minute rush of closing , Congress had authorized a nearly 400% increase in the number of permanent generals and admirals . Since 1939 the Navy had rated only 86 permanent flag officers , the Army 71 generals . Under the new setup the Navy would have 195 , the Army 184 and the new , autonomous Air Force 150 . <P> But even so all the wartime bigwigs would not hold onto their brass . Still in the process of weeding out the excess stars , the Army ( including its air arm ) last week had 500 generals on the rolls , the Navy 400 admirals.
