sistance , worked against the Germans and the Vichy government , and eventually escaped to the United States in early 1943 . His book is a profoundly moving document , both in its history of contemporary events and in its evocation of the spirit of republican France that surmounted crises in 1791 , 1848 , and 1875 . According to M. Fernand-Laurent , the French people are very much for de Gaulle as the symbol of liberation . But he warns de Gaulle against dallying with the idea that the French want strong-man government even by a hero of resistance . The rule of Petain and Vichy , says M. Fernand-Laurent , has caused a universal revulsion against the rule of the soldier . All through the period of the Third Republic military men kept threatening parliamentary institutions . First there was MacMahon , the marshal who was faced down by Gambetta when he tried to tell the parliament what to do . Then there was Boulanger , the " bray ' general " who was groomed to pull a rightist coup d'elal in the eighteen-eighties but who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his exiled mistress . M. Fernand-Laurent seems fearful that de Gaulle may become another MacMahon , who had a courage that Boulanger lacked . At least one reviewer has raised the question of M. Fernand-Laurent 's right to his opinion , inasmuch as he voted power to Petain in 1940 . ' But if no Frenchman who supported Petain after the collapse of the French armies four years ago has a right to speak in the France of the future , then practically ninety per cent of the French people will be excluded from the processes of democracy . The French , as M. Fernand-Laurent says , were stunned in 1940 ; they did n't stir until , after the British R.A.F. had won the battle of London . Real resistance began after the Germans had attacked Russia and after the United States had started in earnest to throw its power into the scales . M. Fernand-Laurent interviewed Petain , Weygand , and Herriot before escaping into Portugal and coming to America . His conversion CO the cause of resistance came when he was in great danger of being seized by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversion , not merely one for the record . If Fernand-Laurent has n't the right to speak in the France of tomorrow , then the war will have been fought , not for democracy , but for a narrow Jacobinism that is Hitlerism turned inside out . This novel about the disintegration of six German soldiers on a firing squad in Czechoslovakia might be called " Vengeance Is Mine . " The author uses one of the six men , in hospital from wounds at Stalingrad , to tell the story . The thesis is that human beings can not do the things that German firing squads are called upon to do and still survive as human beings . So far so good . But if he is saying that the Germans are discovering this for themselves and turning away from their former ways that 's another story . And it is not quite clear which one the author is telling . Interesting and readable but confused . Knopf , $2.50 Leave Her to Heaven , by Ben Ames Williams . Here is a study of evil . For the heroine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demanded complete devotion from those she did love , would stop short of nothing on earth to get that devotion , and , when thwarted , carried on her machinations even from the grave . But of course it is a very moral book too , for though she kills and though she dies in her frenzied desire to hurt the man she could n't hold , and to possess the mind that rejected her , her diabolical and eerie fight is finally lost . . . If it is sometimes hard to believe that one so patently evil could be even temporarily attractive to an apparently discerning man , still there 's enough basic moral conflict , the story races on at terrific speed , there 's a new twist in every chapter , and one can settle down with pleasure to a feast of absorbing melodrama . Houghton Mifflin , $2.50 Nonfiction U. S. War Aims , by Walter Lippmann . There is always interest and controversy when a new book by Walter Lippmann is published , and about this one , a kind of sequel to his U. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever . He does not believe in a world organization for the prevention of war . He believes this could better be accomplished through " neighborhoods " of nations , in spheres of influence . " We have the Wilsonian pattern of collective security , " he says . " We can not build a universal society from the top downwards . We must build up to it from the existing national states and historic communities . " This is a challenging statement to those who , believing in the same basic principles as Mr. Lippmann , still believe they can be safeguarded only through collective security , and it is stated so lucidly and so brilliantly that it should call out the best from those who disagree . Little , Brown , $1.50 I See a New China , by George Hogg . Mr. Hogg , an Englishman , has been working with the Chinese industrial co-operatives , helping them to organize and to produce , since 1939 . His story is personal and alive and exciting and full of the real people who are carrying out the experiment that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
