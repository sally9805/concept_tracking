txt The great fortresses of the Maginot Line lie buried under the hills in the vicinity of Strasbourg . Between the wars France wasted her substance building defense works on her eastern border that neither saved Alsace nor enabled the German conquerors to hold on to it . The towering red cathedral , the most conspicuous landmark and target of that war-haunted borderland , survives the futile fortifications , survives occupation and siege , and today looks across the Rhine at a Reich so ruined that nobody wants to be part of it . The Strasbourg Cathedral survives to become a monument to the Americans who died to free it . The plaque unveiled yesterday in memory of 6,000 American soldiers killed in the liberation of Alsace is a somber reminder that it was not the Maginot Line but the forces of the United States that saved Alsace in the end . It reminds Americans of their investment in an unfinished war . It reminded General de Gaulle , who on other occasions has inclined to forget it , that the similar ideals of France and the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been able to break . " General de Gaulle did not speak yesterday of the internal crisis . That is the subject of his speech today . The hard-pressed Government is apparently so nervous over his re-emergence on the scene that it is trying to divide him into two characters ( crosswise , one supposes , to diminish his uncomfortable stature in both ) : the Liberator and the one-man opposition . Yesterday he held forth in the " non-political " role of the leader of the Resistance , but actually . he touched on the political issue that divides his country and overshadows the globe when he declared that France would stand side by side with the United States " if a new tyranny should menace all or part of the world . " Echo of Truman In his words , and in the voice of the thousands of Frenchmen who cheered them , there was an echo of the closing passage of the President 's address at the Jefferson Day dinner . When Mr. Truman repeated the famous oath of Thomas Jefferson ? " I have sworn upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tyranny over the mind of man " ? he was quoting the man the French think of as the spiritual line between their revolution and ours . Many Frenchmen , including some of his own followers , lament every reappearance of de Gaulle as deepening the divisions in France . Foreign Minister Bidault and the leaders of the Popular Republicans are particularly worried when he speaks . Poor M. Bidault has a hard enough time stretching himself both ways in Moscow in the effort to represent the Communists and his own party without having the tightrope yanked from under him . But the trouble is that the divisions are there . The political structure is not so weak in France as in Italy , where anything may happen any time , but holding it together is a job for a contortionist or a conjuror . Some readers of the signs predict that the Russians will have to reestablish their prestige , damaged in Europe by the American challenge , by " by-passing " Greece and making a move somewhere else , probably in France or Italy . A Communist-inspired coup in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the West . In Italy , especially , it would not be difficult in present conditions , and it is made easier by the curious fact that we are acting to seal the dooi against a Soviet advance into Greece while opening it wide at the other end of the Adriatic . Italy is in some respects more defenseless than Greece , and civil war on that peninsula would have wider repercussions . The new American policy implicit in the aid-to-Greece program is bound to sharpen the so-called East-West alignments . The United States can not shift its position without causing other shifts . France is a good barometer , and in France there are many indications of a strengthening of the antiCommunist opposition besides the move of General de Gaulle to the side of the United States . One of the most interesting is the evolving policy of France at Moscow . Not only have the French edged toward the BritishAmerican thesis on Germany , but the British and Americans have veered nearer the French position . It is becoming clear that among the three Western powers agreement on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Truman program is pretty certain of substantial approval . Even Senator Taft admits it will go through . Since even Mr. Gromyko , with his exceptional opportunity to gauge public opinion in this country , frequently tells his colleagues on the Security Council that certain governmental acts do not represent the American people , the evidence of widespread support for the new policy may surprise the Soviet waders . Certainly our new policy will affect theirs . There is as yet no hint that it has caused them to " give " on the German settlement , but the characteristic of their attitude on Germany is that it is always changing , in the government of their zone as in their complete reversal in regard to the level of industry . Our new policy is a pressure move to obtain Russian agreement to a tolerable peace  --  the kind of peace American boys died for in Alsace  --  and the test is not in the re-forming of political line-ups in Europe . It is not even in Greece , but in the showdown over Germany      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
