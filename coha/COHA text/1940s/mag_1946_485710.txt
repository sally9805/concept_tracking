AsPPROACH THE NEW YEAR WITH HOPE ? a tenuous hope  --  in man 's ability to devise means to prevent his self-destruction . In much less time than it took to perfect the atom bomb , an international commission of scientists and policy-makers has come dose to agreement on a system of atomic-energy control . It is against this background that one must view what transpired in the Atomic Energy Commission late last week . Taking little account of the six-months ' labor of the commission , Mr. Baruch , head of the U. S. delegation , called for a showdown on a resolution embodying the essentials of the American plan with a specific demand for abolition of the veto in matters of punishment for treaty violations . The effect of such a resolution would have been to bypass th detailed reports the commission has been preparing . It would have made the commission a " tail to Mr. Baruch 's kite and flagrantly disregarded the disarmament resolution adopted after much debate by the U. N. Assembly . The Canadian representative , General Andrew McNaughton , who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day by an amendment which , while accepting " the principles on which the findings and recommendations proposed by the representatives of the United States are based , " referred the whole matter back to the working committee of the commission for redrafting , with instructions to take into account the U. N. disarmament resolution . The important result of the crisis is that the commission has asserted its authority over an attempt at godlike intervention by one of its members . It now has a chance to bring the first stage of ' its work to a satisfactorycconclusion . We do not expect that its report will in itself provide the ramparts the world needs against atomic doom . But at least we have reason to hope that it will have laid the foundation .. THE COMPARATIVE ACCORD WITH WHICH the Security Council has accepted the United States resolution on Greece is more than welcome , though there should be no pretense that the terms of reference are broad enough to enable the United Nations to reach a solution of the real problem of Greece . Accepting the situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to original responsibilities , it is certain that the present government is unrepresentative , tyrannical , and incompetent to lead Greece toward a prosperous and democratic way of life . Whatever may be the truth in Mr. Tsaldaris 's charges against his BkIkan neighbors , there can be no doubt that social discontent in Greece is deep and justified . Partisan submission , unaccompanied by governmental reform and the acceptance of a vigorous liberal program , will settle nothing but a diplomatic issue . We feel , therefore , that the Russians were right in insisting that the commission be empowered to probe into strife . provoking conditions within Greece . If the commission is to make proposals for averting a continuance of the present troubles , then to define them as merely border violations is sure to lead to Soviet dissent and possibly a resort to the veto . In any case , the Security Council 's present decision does not exempt London and Washington from their duty of making the strongest recommendations to Athens . The Greek partisan movement has announced its conditions for a cessation of civil war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle-of-the-way government . Yet the basis for settlement exists . Even without direct negotiations between Athens and the partisans , a prompt and thorough liberalization of the government would put an end to the tragic waste of life and resources which threatens Greece with ruin . JUAN PERON , THE ARGENTINE DICTATOR , has scored a major triumph by negotiating a commercial pact with Chile that should do much to advance his political , military , and industrial ambitions . The agreement goes far beyond the usual commercial treaty ; so far , writes Frank Kluckhorn in New York Times , " that few here doubt it implies the closest political ties as well . " President Gonzalez Videla of Chile , it is true , has declared that the pact is devoid of political significance but the terms tell their own story . Henceforth , the two countries will comprise a virtual customs union ; they will use each others ' ports freely , give mutual preferences to each others ' aviation , shipping , and marine insurance . Chile is to receive a $150 million credit from Argentina to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as the reconstruction of the trans-Andean railroad , and for the development of raw material and other The NATION resources required by Argentina to carry out its five-year industrial plan . Argentina , in turn , will enjoy priority in purchasing Chilean products and a preferred place in the Chilean market for its manufactures . All " concessions and advantages reciprocally granted remain excluded from the effects of most-favored-nation treaties " ? even- those with neighboring states . Such provisions are a direct blow at the ideal of non-discriminatory trade which the United States has been busily promoting and a strong protest from the State Department seems to be indicated . Nevertheless , we must recognize our own responsibility in driving Chile into Per6n 's arms . Our capitalists have alternately exploited and negl4ted that country , drawing fortunes from its natural wealth but doing little to establish a stable and progressive economy . A land without capital , it has turned to Argentina for aid in developing industry because it could obtain no adequate help from us. ? * PERON 'S SUCCESS WITH THE CHILEANS IS ONE more indication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his policy of honeyed indulgence . The pattern . of Argentine statism becomes plainer by the week : a drastic military expansion , with compulsory training for all Argentines between twelve and fifty , a five-year plan of industrialization thatis clearly geared to till . needs of war , a program of aggressive economic expansion abroad and one-man rule at home . Messersmith has been called to Washington for discussions , and while the State Department is coy about details , it no longer pretends that the Ambassador is returning " for his health " ? unless that term includes po- , litical well-being . Secretary Byrnes now indicates that the talks will center around a. departmental matter . In view of the sharp note which he is known to have sent Messer-smith only a month ago , it is not far-fetched to assume that this refers to the matter of the department 's having one policy on Argentina and the Ambassador another . Senator Brewster of Maine , returning from a tour of South America , asks that this " schizophrenic " policy be clarified . It should be , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarks suggests the kind of " clarification " th' goes with umbrellas . A YEAR AGO , WE PRAISED MR . TRUMAN 'S directive on China as bold and constructive . It is impassible to be similarly enthusiastic about the 1946 version of that statement , issued last week . While it shows that Washington has not weakened in its desire to promote a democratic solution in China , nothing in it ig calculated to hasten such a solution . Some dramatic ges ? ture was needed to break the logjam at Nanking , but the President 's statement offers little except a long-winded defense of American policy . Only one new fact is disclosed : the Chinese government has not been permitted December 28 , 1946 to avail itself of the $500,000,000 credit granted some months ago  --  presumably because of its failure to set up a unified government . The beneficial effect of withholding financial support is offset , however , by the admission that other kinds of assistance , amounting to some $1,466,000,000 , have been given since V-J Day . The President fails to recognize the stubborn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceived , has failed . While some satisfaction may be derived from Chiang Kai-shek 's dramatic intervention at the National Assembly to prevent the right wing from reinstating the totalitarian 1936 draft of the constitution , the chance of entikag civil strife through one-power mediation is slight . Because of the scale of American assistance to the Kuomintang , General Marshall has forfeited the confidence of the Communists and the Democratic League and convinced right-wing Kuomintang leaders that distrust of Russia will force the United States to support Nanking at all hazards . A modest reason for hope is provided in a suggestion which has just been advanced by Senators Murray and Flanders with the backing of a number of Far Eastern experts . They propose mediation in the Chinese struggle by the United States , Great Britain , and the Soviet Union . While Nanking is understandably cool to the idea NO class ' of wage-earner so wretched that its strikes go unnoticed in the press . Striking coal-miners , teachers , gravediggers , and pearl-divers all have their day in the papers , even if it is n't a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papers walk out and a blanket of silence envelops them that would send a press agent ' to an early grave . A case in point is the strike of Newspaper Guildsmen against J. David Stern , publisher of the Philadelphia Record and the Camden Courier-Post . Soon after the strike was called , the publisher stated his case not only in his own papers , put out by a skeleton staff of executives , but through paid advertisements in the Philadelphia inquirer and the Evening Bulletin . Both these journal have refused to accept advertisements setting forth the . , Guild s reply . The strike has been marked by violence and police brutality that are normally page-one copy for any paper , and in the Stern papers fuel for trenchant and crusading editorials as well . But in the case of the Guild strike such incidents have been ignored by the Philadelphia press or given a stick on page six . Local radio stations , controlled by the papers , have flatly refused to match the time given to management with free time to the strikers . Aside from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are moderate enough ? Mr. Stern 's conduct in the strike comes as a shock to those who have long thought of him as a friend of labor and a champion of civil liberties . He has repeatedly rejected corn- 743 promises and refuses to hear of any wage increase greater than 12 per cent  --  in contrast to the 20 per cent raise given by the non-Guild Chicago Tribune , among others : And the man who has so often damned the ruthlessness of the " barons of industry " has had no word to say about the slugging of his own employees by Philadelphia police . EUGENE TALMADGE WAS PROBABLY A GOOD husband , a kind father , and a laver of animals . But politically he was sheer poison , and it would be hypocritical for us - Co pretend to feel anything but relief at the intervention of death to prevent his taking office as Governor of Georgia for the fourth time . The platform on - which he stood was the reestablishment of " white supremacy " in the state by legislation designed to circumvent the Supreme Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primaries . In addition , he had promised to drop the prosecution of the Klan , which Governor Arnall has been vigorously ' pressing , and no doubt he would have made Georgia safe for its newest purveyors of intolerance  --  the Columbians . Talmadge is reported to have expressed a dying wish that his successor would keep his campaign promises . His followers are apparently backing his son Herman , the recipient of a large write-in vote at last month 's general election , for selection by the General Assembly . The fact that the son sought such a vote in nominal competition with his father suggests that an attempt was being made to provide for the contingency which has now arisen . However , the constitutional position is extremely obscure , with every Georgian faction pressing its own interpretation . Fred Hand , speaker-designate of the General Assembly , says that a new election must be held as soon as possible , and that would certainly seem to be the most democratic method of settling the issue . It would at least give the people of Georgia a chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . REPUBLICANS WHO WOULD BE PRESIDENT are forgetting that it may be as fatal for a candidate to grab for the nomination prematurely as it is for a starving man to rush food down his gullet . With the G. 0 . P. convention eighteen months away , we already have one avowed hopeful , three who do not choose to run but ' ca n't ? be pried out of their track suits , and any number of others who betray no sign of eagerness except that their tongues are hanging out . Harold Stassen , with a Willkie-like scorn for tradition , has honestly declared himself a candidate and opened a campaign office . What is more , he has told labor not to ask for more money now , advised management not to press for restrictive labor legislation , and urged consumers to refuse to buy at inflated prices . Without minimizing the refreshing quality of this performance , it is fair to point out that Stassen has nothing to lose by boldness . Poison to the 744 party leaders , his only chance is to make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taft , and Vandenberg are now on record with coy disavowals of an ambition that all three are plainly straining to realize . Taft forces , strong in the National Committee , have eased a pro-Dewey official out of her job as director of the WO-111011 'S division . John W. Bricker , whom Taft nominated for the Senate in. the hope that he would sooner or later display his ineptitude , is already living up to expectations . Still to be sworn in , he has Washington buzzing with reports of his gauche performance at the Gridiron Dinner . Vandenberg has abandoned his post as adviser to Secretary Byrnes , a position that was compromising him with the McCormick faction of the party , and is consolidating his power in the Senate for a last fling at the nomination . Dewey , counted on for New York 's forty-seven electoral votes , has been lining up the G. 0 . P. Congressmen of that state to support Charles Halleck , a Dewey man , as majority leader of the House , in order to offset Taft 's advantage as majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Warren , happily convinced that all this throat-cutting can only leave more oats for a quiet dark horse . Is There a Middle Way ? W HETHER the members of the President 's Council of Economic Advisers have the drive and intellectual capacity to perform successfully the formidable tasks assigned to them , is a still unanswered question . Their first report shows they are at least excellent diplomats . It is full of seasonal cheer and good humor and includes a little something for everybody . To the nation at large the report offers fair hope for some years of prosperity , subject to a possible minor recession in 1947 . The Wall Street journal school of thought gets a present of a caricature of Keynsian economics in which exclusive reliance on government fiscal measures to prevent unemployment is condemned as akin to the Roman formula of " bread and circuses . " To balance the account , however , planners are comforted by an able analysis of the " Spartan " folly of believing that cyclical depressions are not only inevitable but morally valuable . And " management and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the flattery of an appeal to " their practical wisdom . " A large part of the report is devoted to a defense of the Employment Act of 1946 , to which the council owes its being , and to a discussion of the political and economic philosophies that measure embodies . The claim is made that the act reflects the general American inclination toward a middle way which avoids exclusive reliance in economic affairs on either private enterprise or government . Rejecting the view that the measure The NATION which finally emerged from Congress was a much-diluted version of the original , the report asserts that " it is in fact a broad enabling act of great flexibility as well as vigor . " True , it does not " legislate any specific remedy into use , " but it does clearly establish the " responsibility of the federal government to use all practical means consistent with its needs and obligations and other essential considerations of national policy ? . . to coordinate and utilize all its plans , functions , and resources for the stated purposes of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We agree with the council that the act , for all its weaknesses and omissions , is sufficiently broad and42ex-ible to cover whatever actions are necessary to implement its goals . We are sure that if a new mass-unemployment crisis arises , public opinion will regard it as authorizing government intervention in the national economy on a scale that will dwarf the New Deal - experiments of the thirties . But , as we see it , the value of the act must be judged not by the emergency use which may be made of it , but by the extent to which it helps to prevent emergencies from occurring . On this point the first report of the economic advisers is unhelpfully vague . They tell us that in the years immediately ahead the stimuli to production should be sufficiently powerful to obviate the need for " heroic measures " ; they suggest that this plod can be employed for planning a " gradual shift in expenditure and resource use " so that " more of those semi-luxuries , those welfare and culture goods , " can be placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we would life to see the program spelled out more specifically in terms of education , housing , health , and so forth . It must be recognized that the political climate just now is unfavorable to long-term planning of this kind . A spokesman for the National Association of Manufacturers may hail the council 's report as " an . excellent document , " but his pleasure is due to the fact that it appears to place no- obstacles in the way of the " Operation Capitalism " on which Robert Lynd reports on page 748 . The N. A. M. , knowing full well that the current comeback of private enterprise will prove but fleeting unless a high level of employment can be sustained , ' is offering " practical leadership " for " the resumption of economic progress . " In short , it is proposing to relieve the President and Congress of the responsibilities placed on them by the Employment Act . The present mood of both suggest that they will be only too happy to surrender their burdens . It is probable , therefore , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Advisers it will not be permitted to work seriously on preventive measures ; it will be called in for serious consultation only when " the sickness of an acquisitive society " forces itself very disagreeably on public attention . That - is why we December 28 , 1946 find ourselves sharing Mr. Lynd 's doubts about the practicality of a middle way or , as he puts it , of " a liberal compromise between modern monopoly capitalism and socialism . " Moscow and Iran T HE sudden collapse of the Azerbaijan Autonomous Republic , set up last year with Russian backing , has apparently confirmed those who have always maintained that the Tabriz regime lacked popular support . Others hait , , seen in Moscow 's seeming indifference a proof of Weakness in the Soviet Union itself , and in some quarters there has been a too ready assumption that the Red Army is the only real mainstay of governments friendly to Russia . The Turkish leaders have regarded the downfall as a signal that they may now safely counter Russian pressure and have promptly suppressed opposition newspapers ? Communist and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Undoubtedly , events have proved that the Democratic Party of Azerbaijan was politically weak . Azerbaijan , which took a prominent part in the establishment of constitutional government in Persia in 1906 , has long nourished the desire for autonomy . In a region where land its often amount to two-thirds of the annual crops a demand for agrarian reform has also been strong . All this undoubtedly provided a basis for political action against the government at Teheran , dominated as it is by reactionary parties and individuals . Similarities of language and culture with the neighboring regions of Russia might have been expected to do something to offset the natural dislike of foreign intervention . And Russian strong-arm methods seem not to have been resented at first , for reports from Tabriz agree that in the early months of its existence the autonomous regime was welcomed by a great majority of the peasantry . The same sources attribute its loss of popularity since then to abuses committed by the Democrats . The regime began " to take too much for itself . " The peasants , willing enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as peasants have often done in other places . Again , in the backward mountain valleys where the warrior spirit is strong and whence support might have been drawn , the regime was compelled to rely on persons little adapted to organized political life . There may have been rural resentment of the urban Tudeh , virtually a Communist party , which enjoyed special privileges in Tabriz and other towns . As a total result , the hard-core troops on which the regime could depend were few in number , and the loosely organized militia had no will to resist the heavily armored columns of Teheran . The regime has vanished , and the diplomatic picture 745 in the Near East is somewhat clearer than it was . But the political result may be less desirable . Conservative gains in the general elections last Sunday , indicated by returns which are still incomplete , wilImean a definite setback in Persia 's political development . But the country has so long needed drastic reform that neither repression nor constitutional reaction can silence popular demands for change or guarantee a stable government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia 's hands-off attitude toward its late prot  --  g ? . Is this a sign of recently developed weakness ? We do not doubt that opposition within the U. N. , a decision to concentrate upon the central problems of Europe , and even the obvious economic difficulties in the Soviet Union may have been contributing factors . Yet , even assuming that Azerbaijan 's resistance might have been stiffened by Russian pressure , the events of the past week have only pointed up the logic of a situation that has not changed . If Russia 's primary intention was to serve its economic and strategic aims by seating Azerbaijan deputies in the Teheran parliament , then outright secession was never its aim . On the contrary , Russian interests require an early validation by the Teheran parliament of the oil deals in northern Iran . Qavam 's refusal to call the necessary elections as long as Azerbaijan was cut off from the rest of Persia had already made an alternative Russian policy inevitable . The question now is , what course will the Soviet government follow in the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relations were regulated by a two-power agreement dividing Iran into exclusive " spheres of influence , " It is known that Mr. Bevin proposed to Mr. Stalin that the old arrangement be revived in an amended form . Russia was invited to join with Britain and Iran in developing the Persian oil fields . The suggestion was turned down . If Mr. , Stalin now reverts to this proposal he may find London in a different mood , for British influence is now much stronger in Teheran . Nevertheless , if renewed conversations on Iran do take place , the Russian government will have arguments to which Mr. Bevin might be wise to listen . Within the Soviet Union there is considerable support for a policy of reconciliation with Britain ; the world situation , as well as the prospects for socialism in Europe and Labor control in England , will certainly profit by a rapprochement between Britain and the Soviet Union . Moscow 's bargaining power is still great . 746                    @
