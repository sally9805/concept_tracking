THE AMERICAN LANGUAGE : SUPPLEMENT I-H . L. Mencken-Knopf ( $5 ) . <P> The brashest , bounciest lexicographer who ever lived is a Baltimorean of German extraction named Henry Louis Mencken . His first , famed dictionary ( The American Language , 1919 ) was dedicated to the proposition that English has now become only a dialect of American . <P> Author Mencken first intended The American Language : Supplement I to be a small addition to his American Language , soon discovered that his mass of new material had outgrown the parent volume . Many of Supplement I 's 739 pages are devoted simply to supporting the thesis of The American Language , i.e. , U.S. speech-ways have grown so powerful that they are rapidly reducing to a dialect " the ancient and lovely but now somewhat rheumy language of the British Isles . " Readers of the Supplement will find it packed with boisterous Menckenian humor and casual erudition . <P> British rules of speech have retained some influence in the U.S. , Mencken admits . But whereas most Briticisms rarely penetrate below U.S. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British proletariat via movies , magazines and comic-strips , then worm their insidious way up into the best society . <P> Privy O.K. The American invasion has been so successful that the most determined British purist can not even counterattack without unconsciously employing Americanisms . Most Englishmen would be astonished to learn , for instance , that businessman , governmental , graveyard , law-abiding , lengthy , overcoat and telegram are of U.S. origin . And even Noah Webster would be surprised to learn that O.K. ( " without question the most successful of all Americanisms , old or new " ) has recently been approved by the Judicial Committee of His Majesty 's Privy Council , which " decided formally that inscribing O.K. upon a legal document ' meant that the details contained ( in it ) were correctly given . ' " <P> The past 15 years have shown a verbal inventiveness that , says Mencken , is " the most riotous seen in the world since the break-up of Latin . " Some of the results are rooted in the New Deal and the Depression - e.g. , forgotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more ephemeral third-termite and That Man , and the alphabet soup of government bureaus ( NRA , TVA ) . But the bulk of heavy coinage has come from a slew of irresponsible , word-happy inventors , including such Menckenian heroes as Variety 's late Jack Conway ( who coined baloney , S.A. , high-hat , pushover , payoff , bellylaugh , palooka and scram ) and the inventor of slanguage itself , Walter Winchell.
