Letters to The Times Human Error in Air Crash To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : As a frequent air traveler I must protest against your giving aid in the airlines ' very natural desire to avoid blame for accidents . Your reports and I your editorial attribute the disaster at La Guardia Field to a " freak " change of wind . Along this coast thunder squalls usually approach from the west or northwest , while the surface wind is from the east . Nearly always this results in a sudden change of wind . The skipper of every small sailboat on Long Island Sound knows this . Otherwise he could not get through a summer without losing his mast or capsizing . Any reasonably weather-wise person looking at the western sky in New York Thursday evening would have expected a sudden change of wind from east to northwest . To refer to a common and easily predictable event as a " freak " is misleading . It is an attempt to hide a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take off from a runway so short that a head wind was necessary in order to get into the air at a time when a change of wind was obviously imminent . I do not know who is responsible for this error , but the fact that it was an error which could easily have been avoided should be given enough publicity to insure regulations to prevent its recurrence .
