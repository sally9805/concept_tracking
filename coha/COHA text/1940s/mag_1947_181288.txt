Rheingold ! Rarest gold ! <P> How pure and bright once didst thou <P> beam on us ! <P> For thee , O pure one , now we mourn . <P> Return the gold , O return the pure gold <P> to us ! . . . <P> Now it is gone to the depths : <P> False and cowardly are those who laugh <P> now above ! <P> - Wagner <P> The Russians last week wailed like so many wronged Rhine nymphs . The Central State Pawnshop of the Soviet Purchasing Commission had bought gold bullion in Berlin-50 million marks ' worth of nice , shiny gold for the depleted Soviet treasury . Last week , a frantic message came from Moscow : the gold was phony ! Investigation showed that Germans ( among them many D.P.s ) had operated an illegal smelter in Berlin , casting a base alloy with a thin gold coating into small " gold " bricks . This week , the Russian assayers who had permitted themselves to be fooled were in jail . <P> The Russians could take some small comfort from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as it seemed . They had sold the " gold " on credit , and the Russians had fallen far behind with their payments .
