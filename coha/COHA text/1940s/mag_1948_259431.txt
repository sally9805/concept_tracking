To singers and record men , RCA Victor last week showed a prized secret . It was in the shape of a new seven-inch , unbreakable , paper-thin record that played as much music as a 12-inch ( $1.31 ) disc . But it will reportedly sell for much less . There was one big catch ; the record had to be played at 45 revolutions a minute ( instead of the standard 78 ) . Thus , to play it , phonograph owners would need an expensive special attachment . <P> This news was so calamitous to phonograph makers and record sellers that it threatened to drown out the joyful celebrating over the end of James C. Petrillo 's ban* on recordings ( see Music ) . Said one Chicago radio executive : " It raises chaos in the entire industry , just as a change in rail gauges would do to railroads . " <P> Actually , the industry was in something like chaos already . The trouble started last June when Columbia Records brought out its long-playing Microgroove records ( TIME , July 26 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry grumbled , and phonograph owners had to buy an attachment to play the records , Columbia had scored an impressive beat . <P> It brought out its revolutionary new records at a time when the business had gone to pot , largely because of consumer apathy . The " L.P. " record caught on so well that the industry estimated Columbia has sold $5,000,000 of the new records in four months , double what it had expected . <P> The Microgroove records , with their clearer tone and 22-minute playing time on each side , represented a much needed technical advance . But they also cut into other record sales by carrying an entire symphony on one 12-inch record for $4.85 v. $8.50 for a six-record RCA Victor album . And L.P. records scared phonograph buyers off ; they did n't want to buy phonographs that turned at the old speed , especially when rumors got around of the new Victor record . <P> Despite Christmas shopping , record sales were off 40% for the year from 1947 . Sales of phonographs , already hit by television sales , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to $50 worth of records free with every table model and $200 worth with every radio-phonograph console . <P> Dealers thought that the new Victor record would make things even worse . Though Victor was mum on its record , the industry expects it to go on sale early in 1949 , and RCA was reportedly dickering with Capitol Records and Decca to make the record standard for the industry . <P> * The settlement left both sides where they stood a year ago , when Petrillo charged that canned music from jukeboxes and radio stations was threatening the livelihood of his musicians . He then invoked the ban . But he will do little better now . Record makers will pay royalties of between 1% and 2% a record into the musicians ' welfare fund , about the same as before . Estimated royalties : $2,000,000 a year . The peace pact was tentatively drawn two months ago . It was held up to make sure that it did not violate the Taft-Hartley Act , which bans the paying of royalties into union-controlled welfare funds . The solution , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a nonunion administrator .
