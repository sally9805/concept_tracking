Last week , for the first time in more than twelve radio seasons , neither NBC ( the old Red network ) nor the Blue Network broadcast an hour-long adaptation of a stage play . None was scheduled for the future . Possibly not many millions of listeners noticed this , but it meant that the book was closed on an era of radio . <P> Early enthusiasts and amateurs of broadcasting took the theater as their heritage , as a matter of course . At first , being poor , they stuck to classics on which no royalties had to be paid . In 1928 pioneering NBC broadcast The Tempest-the first Shakespeare on the air . In that year it also produced classic Victorian melodramas like East Lynne . <P> By 1930 , having progressed to Ibsen , NBC formed a Radio Guild , boldly undertook to produce one play a week , 52 weeks in the year . For several years one man , Vernon Radcliff , adapted every play , directed every performance . NBC , prospering in the great Depression , gave him enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S. Kaufman . <P> By 1938 another type of radio drama was in full flower , especially at CBS : the original radio script , with its narrators , its musical " bridges , " its fade-outs , fade-ins , sound effects . Daytime serials had long since arrived . <P> Another arrival in radio about this time was " the educational tie-up " by which networks displayed their utility and virtue . Colleges listened as NBC 's " Great Plays Series , " successor to the Radio Guild , started off in 1938 and in 1938-39 went on a grand tour of the ages , opening with Blanche Yurka in The Trojan Women . Other items that year : Molire , Tolstoi and George Bernard Shaw 's own adaptation of Back to Methuselah . In the last three years this sort of thing has been overshadowed by commercial radio theaters , the fresh work of the Columbia Workshop , variety shows . <P> Last week NBC producers and directors , meditating on the twelve-year experience , wondered if the future belonged to " original " radio writing ( many examples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high-school boy ) , or if the classic works of the theater would again be broadcast . Conceding that about one in 20 of their past productions had had truly professional finish , they agreed on certain requirements for future radio playhouses . One requirement : more than the six to seven hours of rehearsal that are now routine .
