Mary McMillin never took a golf lesson in her life , and her swing looks it . Both arms fly up in the air in " a " short , jerky backswing and come down with practically no wrist motion . But back in Green Bay , Wis. , where she worked as a stenographer , 19-year-old , 5 ft. 2 in . Mary McMillin had won the state women 's golf championship two years running . Last week , in her first round at the Western Amateur Tournament at Cleveland , Newcomer Mary drew Defending Champion Phyllis Otto and confided to her mother : " I 'm glad to be able to go around with such a good player as Miss Otto . " <P> It was Mary 's first important tourney , but because she did n't expect to win she felt little pressure . On the twelfth hole , she was two up . Miss Otto took the next two to square the match . On the next hole , Mary shot a ball out of a trap and it plopped in the cup for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ golf , it was exit Miss Otto . <P> In the semifinals , Mary was matched against the great Mildred ( " Babe " ) Didrickson Zaharias . Babe 's tee shots boomed down the fairways about 80 yards farther than Mary 's . Mary 's unorthodox swing , which her father , a golfing dentist , refuses to correct , looked pitifully inadequate . But the closer she got to the green , the deadlier her game became . The best stick in her bag was a battered 15-year-old putter , with which she sank two 35-ft. putts . Babe fell two holes behind in the first three and could not catch up . Exit the Babe . <P> That was as much Cinderella business as Mary could stand . She cried on her mother 's shoulder , right before everybody . Next day in the final , she lost out , 11-and-10 , to Veteran Campaigner Louise ( " Sister " ) Suggs of Lithia Springs , Ga. , who won her seventh major tournament of the year .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
