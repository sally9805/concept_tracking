A Senate subcommittee with eyes cocked at the political heavens summoned Chief of Staff Eisenhower last week to explain the demobilization snafu-and incidentally to air their own views . They reckoned without Strategist Ike Eisenhower . Before the week was out he had passed the buck right back to Congress . <P> Angered by Congressional needling , Ike Eisenhower gritted out : " I have commanded more American soldiers than anyone else in history . You men can not possibly have a greater interest in them than me . " <P> And in that mood , before the committee , before both houses and over the radio , he spelled out the problem . <P> " To Secure the Peace . " Tardily , after the unsoldierly hubbub of homesick G.I.s had reached a stage of near-mutiny ( TIME , Jan. 21 ) , Chief of Staff Eisenhower had forbidden any more soldiers ' demonstrations on pain of court-martial . Now he told why he had put the brakes on demobilization and thus touched off the rumpus . <P> Since V-J day , demobilization machinery had restored to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had figured possible . At that headlong rate of discharge , said General Ike , we would have soon " run out of Army . " <P> Why did the U.S. need to keep so many men in arms ? Eisenhower spelled it out : in Austria and Germany the Army has the job of supervising and policing 15,000,000 civilians and destroying Germany 's ability to make war ; it has the same kind of job in the Pacific . G.I.s also have to protect $14 billion of U.S. property scattered around the globe . They have to roll up the bases . At home they have the job of keeping house and demobilizing their highpoint colleagues . <P> The size of the task would diminish but there would be work for a long time to come . The Army figured it would need a minimum 1,500,000 on July 1-not , Eisenhower was careful to point out , as a permanent military establishment but as an interim force " to secure the peace . " <P> " A Most Fateful Decision . " With an air of you-asked-for-it he announced that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enlisted men with 40 points or 24 months service . The order would cut deep . The Army counts on only 135,000 from Selective Service , which expires on May 15 . The enlistment pool was drying up . When July rolls around , Army authorities fear , they may be a quarter of a million men short . <P> That was the fact which Congress had to face . What was the answer ? <P> Eisenhower said solemnly : Either the Army will have to have more men , " or competent authority-I presume the Congress itself-will have to relieve the Army of its vitally important missions ... a most fateful decision .
