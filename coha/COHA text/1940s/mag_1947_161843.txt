From the nettle , radio , a British listener plucked a strange flower , literature . Speculating on radio 's influential future , Novelist Richard Hughes ( High Wind in Jamaica ) mused in the current Virginia Quarterly Review : <P> <P> At least once before , a mechanical invention had made a revolution in literature . For before the printing press was invented , the writer reached the majority of his public not through their eyes but through their ears . Poetry was sung or recited ; prose books , too , were recited or read aloud . . . . The effect of the printing press on literary style was ... a slow development , culminating only in our own century . Gradually . . . poetry acquired a subtler intricacy as the poet found he need no longer rely on ... immediate aural impact . . . . Prose likewise developed a greater elaboration of structure . . . . <P> Even then reading aloud died hard , barely a generation ago . . . . With a single oil lamp in the surrounding gloom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time : in the general glare of electric light that custom too has practically disappeared . Thus the last echoes of heard literature . . . had only just died away when a second revolutionary invention , wireless broadcasting , set the pendulum swinging again in the opposite direction . The Voice had come back . . . . <P> Nearly a quarter of a century has passed . . . . Radio plays have passed from the stage of a casual experiment to ... the most popular of all programmes . . . . But a new art ? Bunk ! . . It is useless for a radio dramatist today to attempt to write with any subtlety , or to draw characters not out of the stock-type catalogue ; the play will be on the air and off again before the cast have a chance to discover what he is at . ... If radio put on a quarter of the number of new plays . . . radio drama might have a chance of growing out of short pants . . . . <P> I do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radio literature but that the effect of radio on literature generally will be as profound , if almost as slow , as the effect of the printing press .
