A study of what happened when the lid came off the coffee pot may be prophetic of what will happen when the lid comes off everything . The Wall Street Journal found : <P> &gt; Coffee sales dropped from 10-50% ; i.e. , people hoard when things look scarce , stop buying and consume their hoards when supplies look plentiful again . Added evidence : tea and cocoa ( still on a quota basis , and allegedly scarce ) are still in as much demand as ever , though in the U.S. as a whole they are traditionally second-best substitutes for coffee . <P> &gt;Sales of ersatz coffee and " extenders , " which boomed during rationing , dropped to almost nothing-probably an advance tip on what will happen to things like rayon stockings when war ends and silk and nylon are available again . <P> &gt;But people still buy higher-priced coffee , which they learned to like in the one-cup days . Perhaps the most significant trend of the lot for the long term , this indicates that , so long as the national income stays high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality .
