Because Lonnie E. Smith is a Negro , election judges in Houston , Tex . barred him from the polls in a 1940 Democratic primary . Lonnie Smith saw his lawyers . This week the Supreme Court of the U.S. decided ( 8-to-1 ) that Texas must not bar Negroes from voting in primaries because of race . This had meaning for all Southern states-although poll taxes and " educational requirements " will still keep many a Negro from voting . <P> The Court had scrapped a nine-year-old precedent . In 1935 the Justices had decided that voting in the primaries was a " privilege " which the Democratic Party could extend or withhold-something like using the lounge in an exclusive club . This week they decided that those who miss out on the Southern Democratic primaries miss out on the election . <P> What most annoyed Lone-Dissenter Justice Owen Roberts was a Court which keeps changing its mind . Said he : Supreme Court decisions are beginning to look like " a restricted railroad ticket , good for this day and train only . "   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
