See Cover ) <P> Down the Queen Elizabeth 's gangplank and on to Manhattan 's Pier 90 one day last week the British movie industry stepped . Waiting on the dock , like a stack of plump pillows at the end of a laundry chute , stood a half-dozen U.S. movie executives . As Cinemogul Joseph Arthur Rank saw them , he blinked and turned up his coat collar against the chill May morning . But then Arthur Rank 's face broke into a smile . He strode forward . As the expectant executive smiles faded , he walked over and wrung the hand of Judge Lewis L. Fawcett , the brisk , vigorous executive of the World 's Sunday School Association . Cinemogul Rank , a Yorkshireman and a conscientious Sunday-school teacher , was about the Lord 's business as well as his own . <P> At a luncheon in the Commodore Hotel that day he attended to the Lord 's business exclusively . He addressed a meeting of the Sunday School Association , and it awarded him a certificate for his religious work . Said Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can spread the gospel of Christ is through movies . " Then Mr. Rank went about his own-and the Empire's-business , which is to spread British movies all over the globe . In a swirl of breakfasts , luncheons , teas , cocktail parties and after-theater snacks , he confabbed with RKO Production Boss Dore Schary , 20th Century-Fox Boss Spyros Skouras , who is an old friend , John D. Rockefeller Jr . and Railroader &; Picturemaker Robert R. Young , who will show Rank around the U.S. in his private car . They all listened to Mr. Rank with respect . As one shrewd U.S. movieman said : " Rank is one of the seven or eight key men they are counting on over there to pull them out of the mud . " <P> Great Expectations . Trade , which once followed the flag , now follows the films . And Rank is , in effect , Britain 's chosen instrument to build an industry able to compete with Hollywood in the world market-and so get Britain some of the dollars she desperately needs . He has made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the British movie industry , once compounded of " concupiscence , chicanery and confusion , " into a powerful monopolistic instrument , and fashioned a new economic empire . As powerful as any film enterprise in the world , his empire comprises over 60% of Britain 's theaters and 50% of its moviemaking . It holds in fee tributary production , distribution and exhibition companies in Canada , South Africa , Australia and the U.S. The sun never sets on the emblem of his pictures : a gilded muscleman ( ex-Boxer " Bombardier " Wells ) swatting an eight-foot gong . <P> Last year the gong rang in some impressive film achievements . Two British films ( Henry V and Brief Encounter ) were voted among the year 's best movies by Manhattan critics . Last week nine other Rank pictures ( Odd Man Out , Stairway to Heaven , etc. ) were holding down Manhattan cinemansions . And next week Rank 's Great Expectations is scheduled to open in Manhattan 's massive Radio City Music Hall-the movie world 's equivalent of a White House reception for an immigrant .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
