txt 1 WASHINGTON , Jan. 22 ? President Truman became the country 's first $100,000-a-year President this week by the skin of his teeth . The day before his inauguration he signed the bill raising his pay . If the measure had reached him on the afternoon of his inauguration  --  after he had taker the oath for the new term ? he could not have collected a red cent of the $25,000 increase . Only Mr. Truman 's successors would have benefited , since the Constitution prohibits the raising of a President 's salary during his current term . It was a nice fat rise that Congress provided , advancing the Presidential salary from $75,000 to $100,000 . That by itself was not overly generous , as taxes will take a large part of it . However , Congress also granted him $50,000 a year , tax free , for expenses , for which he is not required to give an accounting . . This allowance is ' n addition to a present allowance Of 1 ; 40,000 for travel and entertainment . Financial Embarrassment The aim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a President who does not have great means to live in the ' White House without financial embarrassment . This applies to Mr. Truman . As a Senator he used to help his wife with the dishes and , it is said , he had less than $1,000 in cash assets when he first became Chief Executive . The sharp rise in pay from the $20,000 of the Vice-Presidency to the $75,000 of the highest office did not allow a generous enough margin to cover the even sharper change in his mode of living . Suddenly he had to preside over a household with thirty-one servants . He had to hold impressive state dinners , balls and receptions . Of course , the cost of such functions was chargeable to the official exchequer . But he had to adjust himself to this new station in life and that cost money . The change also compelled him and his family to widen the scope of their personal affairs , and that also increased the drain on the family budget . Take the cost of the inaugural gowns for Mrs. Truman and daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they cost , and the White House is not telling . ) Has to Go Further It is plain that the President 's $75,000 has to go much farther than a private citizen 's $75,000 . ( Mr. Truman still is in a much lower bracket than many other prominent persons , such as movie stars . ) When Mr. Truman first assumed the office on April 12 , 1945 , he soon realized that the had to cut expenses . His out-of-pocket expenses for his family and the incidental costs involving the large household staff ran to $2,500 1 monthly . He could not afford to go on like that , what with a Federal tax bill estimated at $46,770 yearly and a Missouri income tax of about $1,000 . He called in his big-business friend , George Allen , to make an economy survey . The result was that the thirty-one ' servants were reduced to twenty-four ( now up to twenty-five ) . At that , Mr. Allen reduced the family budget only by $500 a month . Family Lives Modestly Naturally the Trumans regard their family budget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American , family 's . So no one knows how much Mr. Truman pays out for insurance , gifts , political donations , clothing , etc . From all indications , however , the family lives modestly . Margaret was a college girl until recently . Having embarked on a career as a concert singer , she is now said to be self-supporting , but previously her education and other expenses were paid out of her father 's salary . With the Presidency , the First Family got free housing . But the living costs involved were many times higher than the saving in the rent they had paid on their comparatively modest apartment on Connecticut Avenue . ? The best available pre-rise analysis of Mr. Truman 's financial status follows : Tax-wise persons estimate that from his $75,000 salary Mr. Truman had left only about $4,200 a year . The Republican tax cut last year ( passed over his veto ) raised this by $10,000 toi $12,000 a year . Thus he could have counted on an actual annual ' net of about $14,000 to $16,000 . Mr. Truman has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advance and with a taxi rise of the scope he recommended , .1 some tax experts have estimated that he would have left the Presidency four years from now approximately broke . Hoover Urged Rise Frank Sanderson keeps Mr. Truman 's accounts relating to the White House executive offices . Howell G. Crim , the chie , . usher , looks after the household outlays . Sometimes expenses overlap their two jurisdictions . The " stringless " $50,000 should make it easier to handle these items . What will Mr. Truman do with the extra money ? In his study , he has a modest collection of historic pistols . With a few dollars to spend freely once in a while , he might develop this into a real hobby . From all the evidence , however , the President is not likely to ride a hobby as hard as President Franklin D. Roosevelt , the stamp collector . Most likely he will put some money away for his old age .                    @
