The Senate had debated labor legislation for two weeks , trying to do something with the House 's Case bill , aimed at curbing the economic powers of labor . The debate had grown violent ; into dignified speeches crept such words as " skunk . " Labor 's overheated friend , Claude Pepper , and a little coterie of other friends waged an undeclared filibuster against laws which would take away any of labor 's rights . Then the Senators walked over to the House to hear what Harry Truman had to say . <P> Some were shocked ; others were troubled . Senator Robert Taft , who has long demanded revision of labor laws , turned thumbs down on the President 's " expedients . " Republican Senator Eugene Millikin thought it unconstitutional . Oregon 's Wayne Morse , incensed because the bill had been short-circuited around the Education and Labor Committee , resigned from the committee . Action was postponed . But the Senate , jolted by Harry Truman 's explosive move , really got down to business on the Case bill . <P> Before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with tough amendments . <P> In some respects , it was even tougher than the House version which the Education and Labor Committee had tried to eviscerate . Committeemen like elderly Senator Elbert Thomas , James E. Murray , James M. Tunnell , Joseph Guffey , Claude Pepper , were routed . The driving forces were Senator Taft and Minnesota 's Joe Ball , both pressing for permanent labor legislation which would correct the in equities of the well-meaning but lopsided Wagner Act . <P> The chief points : <P> Health and welfare funds , such as John Lewis wants , must be administered by joint management-union committees . <P> Management and workers must observe a 60-day cooling-off period before resorting to strikes or lockouts . <P> Fact-finding commissions would be set up to settle disputes in public utilities . <P> Workers ( as well as management ) must bargain collectively . ( Under the Wagner Act workers can now bargain or not , as they like . ) <P> Foremen could join or form unions but could not be recognized as bargaining agents under the Wagner Act . <P> Unions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of contracts . Heretofore , some unions have violated labor contracts with little fear of penalties . Individuals who went on " wildcat " strikes ( outlawed by union leaders ) could be fired . <P> " Secondary boycotts " ( refusal of nonstriking workers to handle " hot " goods from struck plants ) would be illegal . <P> The bill would now go back to the House , which would hardly weaken the bill . It was a bleak day for labor .
