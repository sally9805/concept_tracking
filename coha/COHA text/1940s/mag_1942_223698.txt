Tension rose in Cairo . Men told each other : Something has got to break . It was like thunder from the desert , an intangible but ever-growing certainty that a blow was about to fall somewhere around the Mediterranean . <P> Who would strike first ? And where ? Ordinary men-junior officers , correspondents , British Tommies , U.S. privates-did not have the answer . They simply knew that Churchill had been in Cairo , that reinforcements had been pouring into Egypt , that the British forces had a new aggressive commander ( see col. 3 ) . <P> Men felt in their bones that the indecisive sparring on the Egyptian front had gone on long enough . They sensed , too , the fact that the war in North Africa had reached a curious and explosive stage , where each side had everything to lose , and nothing to gain , by waiting for the other to strike . It was this feeling , a kind of intestinal divination , that made men everywhere listen for the guns . <P> On the El Alamein Front , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real battles had been fought since late June . But each side had learned a great deal about the other , and what the British learned about Rommel was not pleasant : <P> &gt; Despite continual bombing by British and U.S. planes , Tobruk and Bengasi were still open ports , through which a stream of men and supplies flowed from Greece and Crete . Motor-driven lighters , laden with supplies , hugged the coast in Rommel 's immediate rear , supplementing the truck convoys on land . Bombings had impeded , but by no means broken up , this front-line supply system . Nor had Allied air attack smashed the Luftwaffe 's airtransport line from Crete to the African battlefront . <P> &gt; Rommel 's air force was probably stronger than it was just after he halted at El Alamein . Allied flyers recently spotted big Luftwaffe concentrations at Rommel 's advanced airdromes ; they made no claim that bombing had destroyed or even seriously dented them . <P> &gt; A regiment of the famed Fliegerkorps parachutists from Crete was in Rommel 's front line , getting acclimated for desert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Greece and Crete , whence they could directly attack the British rear along the coast , or be shifted to Africa for use from Rommel 's airdromes . <P> &gt; British patrols said that Rommel had withdrawn the bulk of his German troops to the rear for rest and refitting , had left Italians to hold most of the front . He evidently had a poor opinion of Britain 's Eighth Army , and of the chances of a British offensive . <P> The British in Egypt have been reinforced . Whether they have received enough from Britain and the U.S. for an effective offensive , no one outside the high command knows . The R.A.F. had clear superiority in the air when the front was stabilized at El Alamein ; it now has considerable help from the U.S. Army Air Forces : U.S. medium bombers last week joined the heavy bombers and fighters already in action in Egypt . Correspondents , summing up the total of U.S. aid , were allowed to say only that it was not yet a flood , but that it was more than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
