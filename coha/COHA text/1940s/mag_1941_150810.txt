Like an unexpected break in a Shostakovich symphony , the grinding cacophony of production in the great Curtiss-Wright aircraft plant near the Buffalo airport clattered to a deep , silent stop one day last week . For an hour the production line stood still while Big Bill Knudsen and other national defense bigwigs dedicated a low-lying , businesslike monument to U.S. ingenuity and industrial speed . <P> The occasion was manufactured to give inspiration to national defense workers , comfort to the U.S. 's allies . But the achievement was real . Nine months previously the first shovelful of dirt had been turned on a site where the plant was to grow . Now it stood there complete , more than 34 acres of floor space , crowded with machine tools operated by 6,500 workmen . <P> Better than that , it had been in production two full months . In the crowded yard alongside the speaker 's stand stood scores of lean camouflaged pursuit planes and potbellied observation planes ( O-528 ) . Close by stood the 2,000th fighter produced by Curtiss-Wright since the war began . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Although P-40s ( British Tomahawks ) are still giving a stout account of themselves in battle with Messerschmitt logs over Britain 's Egyptian and Far Eastern fronts , the Kittihawk is a long jump ahead . It is slicker and leaner than the Tomahawks . From its wings bristle six .50-caliber machine guns . It has better armor for pilots and , best of all , it has a lot more speed-reputedly a top of 380-390 m.p.h . <P> This speed of the Kittihawk comes from a new Allison engine , the model " F. " Turning out 1,150 h.p. , it has 100 more horses than the old Allison " C , " although smaller in overall dimensions . This engine is also in high-speed production at the Allison plant in Indianapolis . More than 550 were coming off the line every month . <P> Unlike the superpowered , high-altitude fighters now in the works for the U.S. Army and Navy flying services , the Kittihawk is this year 's airplane , will do plenty of fighting before the snow flies .

They start to grow in an older and smaller ( 827,000 sq . ft. ) plant across town at Tonawanda where fuselages are built , engines and armor are installed . At the new airport plant wings and landing gear are added before they are flown away . <P> In the red fire of the dedication , pilots hurtled the old Tomahawk and the new Kittihawk across the field leaving behind them a sound like the ripping of a canvas tent . They did vertical slow rolls , snapped null over on their backs and back again to demonstrate fighting maneuverability . While their workmen-builders shouted applause they sent their speedsters straight up thousands of feet , looped , did soaring Immelmann turns , flew on their backs . <P> But the biggest shout went up when a pilot ripped across the field in next year 's airplane , an XP-46 , leaner and trimmer than its blood brothers . Still experimental , the XP-46 is Curtiss-Wright 's bid for speeds above 400 miles an hour . Secret in design , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " C. "
