 | CALIFORNIA 'S NEXT HUNDRED YEARS 1 IN PRIDE and pageantry the state of California is celebrating its hundredth birthday and commemorating the great gold rush that started it on its way to fortune and fame in 1849 . Torrents of printed and spoken words are flowing at the centennial fiestas along the Mother Lode and in the cities and hamlets throughout the state , in praise of California 's achievements in the brief years of its youth . California the blessed and beautiful , the nation 's third most populous and fastest-growing commonwealth ; the state with the most autos , the longest bridges , the best schools , the fewest slums , the greatest variety of farm products , the biggest athletes ; the abode of movie stars and of millionaires ; Glamour Girl in the American sisterhood of states ! Most of the purple superlatives fit , for probably never before in history have men achieved such an opulent civilization in so short a time . But as California stands on the threshold of its second century and prepares to welcome its second 10 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask , What about the future ? Two elements are basic to a prosperous , enduring society : healthy people and an ample storehouse of natural wealth . California has plenty of healthy people . World War II upped its population from around 7 million to 10=1 million , and more are pouring across the borders at the rate of about 20,000 a month in what probably has been the biggest human migration in history . Governor Earl Warren says the state must spread its table for a family of 20 million before many years . But its once lavish store of natural resources ? those Godmade endowments that feed and house and embellish a state ? have been so depleted through a century of careless exploitation that thoughtful Californians are beginning to wonder whether their state can long maintain its high Hy ing standards , let alone absorb the millions of new families that are on their way . In record time the rugged pioneers and empire builders turned California from a pastoral land peopled by a few Mexicans into the magnificent state it is . But what did they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaches of fertile land ; the clear , free-flowing streams , the majestic stands of virgin pine and redwood forests ; the oil and gas and minerals , and the vast reserves of ground water under the earth ; the clean and lovely beaches that rimmed the ocean rich in marine resources ? Exact statistics covering the state 's earlier years are lacking , but estimates have been made to indicate that California has paid a staggering price for its century of progress . Billions of dollars in irreplaceable wealth have vanished through overgrazing , preventable brush and forest fires , ruinous get-rich-quick timber logging , hydraulic and dredge gold mining , wasteful use of oil , gas , and ground water , stream and beach pollution , and other prodigal practices . Bernard DeVoto says that the big sins that have been committed against the West 's natural resources have been committed by Westerners themselves . Surely this is true of California . First , what of California 's two basic resources , its soil and its water reserves ? California 's land area covers roughly 100 million acres , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30 million acres of farmland about five sixths are in range and " sky farms , " and one sixth in irrigated farms . Damage due to overgrazing of sheep and cattle , fires , and poor farm practices has been greatest in the unirrigated hill country . There is a comfortable illusion that California has escaped that world-wide sickness of the soil known as erosion . This is true , relatively speaking , but only because her lands have been farmed so short a time . The U.S. Soil Conservation Service 's last report reveals that 3 million California acres have lost over three fourths of their topsoil through erosion ; that wind erosion has damaged more than 2 million and gully erosion some 7 million acres ; that " moderate gully erosion " is gradually taking its toll on 15 million acres ; that about two thirds of the state 's total land area " is in need of soil con-53 @#  | servation practices . " Land without topsoil is dead land , its food-producing elements washed or blown away for at least four hundred years . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West is land irrigated through ditches , with life-giving water drawn from canals , streams , and wells . The 5 million man-watered acres in California 's many valleys produce 85 per cent of the state 's 2-billion-dollar farm income . What of them ? Lying flat for the most part on the valley floors , these acres have suffered relatively little from the gully erosion that has ruined so many acres on the slopes . California also has been spared the invasion of corn and tobacco , the big soil-despoilers of the Midwest and the South . Wind erosion , however , is a new and serious threat , particularly to the broad plains of the southern San Joaquin Valley , where King Cotton and his motley subjects have moved in to claim tens of thousands of acres . This area threatens to become a problem area , the first California Dust Bowl . In the southern end of the San Joaquin Valley , recent winds have blown away topsoil from an estimated 250,000 acres of rich farmland . Last year , Kern County was visited by eight " dusters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Year with a storm so severe that it piled drifts two feet high on cotton fields , caused damage of at least a million dollars , and so blinded the countryside that traffic was shut off on Tejon Pass from the valley to Los Angeles . This is the land of the great holdings made famous by Steinbeck 's Grapes of Wrath and Mrs. Hobart 's Cleft Rock , where three corporate firms a land company , an oil corporation , and a railroad ? own 353,000 ' acres , a vast , almost treeless reach of mechanized " factories in the field " farmed by tractors and itinerant families . 2 THE number one problem of the valleys , however , is not erosion of the land ; it is shortage of water . This is a long , tragic story . One chapter tells of the hydraulic miners of the early days who hosed out great holes in the Mother Lode in their frantic gold hunt , literally moving mountains , silting the river bottoms , destroying navigation and salmon spawning grounds , and causing floods along the Sacramento @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more in levees and other flood-control works . Another chapter relates to their successors , the big corporate gold-diggers of yesterday and today who have sent and are sending their huge dFagline dredgers and " doodlebugs " into the fertile river bottoms of the Feather , the Bear , the Yuba , the American , the Calaveras , the Stanislaus , the Mokelumne , the Merced , and the Tuolumne rivers to ' tear away productive farms and leave in their stead sterile , unsightly mountains of gravel . All attempts to halt this destruction of basic wealth have failed in the California legislature . Another chapter is the story of the copper smelters of the Upper Sacramento , the Pit , and the Calaveras river districts where fumes once poisoned plant life and left the hills stripped of vegetation . Another tells of the gutting of forest and brush cover by axe and fire and of the overgrazing of the state 's 45 million acres of watershed , thus subjecting these natural reservoirs to erosion and the silting of stream beds and reservoirs . The acute shortage of irrigation water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too many irrigators and not enough conservation storage and distribution works . High farm prices resulting from the two wars have been a great temptation to farmers ? particularly to the big corporate planters . Over the past four decades an average of about 60,000 acres a year has been added to the irrigated area of California 's Central Valley ( the Sacramento and the San Joaquin valleys plus the connecting Delta ) . In 1947 , in six southern San Joaquin Valley counties alone , 114,000 new acres were brought under irrigation , and 1948 saw the addition of 120,000 more . Since the building of irrigation works is from fifteen to twenty years behind normal schedule , practically all the water for this newly cultivated land came from wells . Years ago California began worrying over the condition of the San Joaquin Valley 's underground storage . Artesian wells failed , Tulare Lake went dry , and the underground supply gave out in some areas of the southern end of the valley . The encroaching desert claimed some 80,000 acres and menaced about 800,000 more in irrigated farms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undertook , through their big State Water Plan , to import the floodwaters of the Sacramento River a distance of 500 miles into the southern San Joaquin . This project proved too costly for California alone . The state appealed to Uncle Sam , and ten years ago the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation took over . Today it is finishing the first step of the multimillion-dollar Central Valley Project . CVP will rescue with new and supplemental water about a million acres of farms from the desert 's clutches , but the initial works will not begin to supply the increased need . Charles Kaupke , Kings River Watermaster , estimates that 5 million acre-feet of water are being pumped annually from under six counties , and only 12 million annually replenish it . The initial CVP is an emergency rescue job that will bring these counties about 800,000 acrefeet of imported water a year . They need at least 2 million . What will California do about its other new water customers ? Sinking water tables , some now as low as 450 feet , wells costing as much as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damaging to the soil in many places , dust storms , and other danger signals warn of the need for early , drastic , and costly action . " Bring us more water and quick ! " is the cry every Congressman hears as he travels down the Great Valley . The same cry is heard in the Salinas , the Santa Clara , and other coastal valleys where the population has outgrown the water supply , in Santa Barbara , Ventura , Solano counties , in the Sierra foothill fruit belt , and , of course , in watershort southern California , which has a story of its own . Foreseeing the time in the not too distant future when they will have to refuse to admit migrant families for lack of enough water , Los Angeles engineers today discuss ways of treating sewage to use its water for irrigation , of distilling salt water into fresh , of importing water from the West 's only big surplus ? the Columbia River Basin , far to the north . The state 's water and power shortage was dramatized into headline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1948 when Santa Barbara citizens watered their lawns with secondhand bath water and bought drinking water from tank trucks ; when Coalinga hauled water a distance of 40 miles in tank cars ; when Sierra foothill communities lost heavily in ruined orchards and stockmen moved their herds to neighbor states . Only an unusual series of late spring rains saved the state from a major disaster . The Federal Bureau of Reclamation claims to have the answer to California 's chief water needs , particularly in its Great Valley , where the bulk of her food and fruit is grown . When the CVP 's initial works are finished and the " moving of the waters " begins in 195Q , the water conservation program for the state 's " two-billion-dollar empire " will have just begun . The Bureau has prepared over the years a massive report with plans for harnessing all of the valley 's undeveloped water and power . This master plan would double the valley 's irrigated area to some 62 million acres , develop some 8 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity a year , and provide enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These works , costing more than ? : 2 billion dollars , would utilize the Central Valley 's greatest remaining unused resource , 8 million acrefeet of water which now annually waste from Central Valley into the ocean . The cost would be largely repaid to the government from the sale of water and power . Indispensable as such a self-liquidating , comprehensive development is to California 's future , conservationists point out that with the dam and canal building there must also be carried out a prozram of upstream conservation to restore and preserve the forests and brushlands above the darts ? the source of the water that fills the reservoirs and restores the underground supplies : And this brings us to consideration of the state of California 's third most precious resource , her timberlands. 3 WHEN James Marshall saw the first glitter of California gold at Coloma on January 24 , 1848 , he happened to be working at John Sutter 's little sawmill on the American River . California then had more than 20 million acres in heavy stands of virgin limber . Within a short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountains . Armies of woodsmen raced in with axes and donkey engines and flumes and railroads , and the cry of " Gold ! " gave way to the cry of " Timber ! " Whether through ignorance or greed or both , these woodsmen gave little heed to selective logging or of her means of saving young stock for tomorrow 's harvest , or to preserving the precious undergrowth from burning . Today you 'll find their accusers in miles of stumps , in blackened and denuded hillsides , in abandoned milltowns and impoverished homes . In winter you 'll see other accusers in swollen , yellow , silt-laden rivers , and in summer in dry arroyos filled with sand instead of water . When gold was discovered California had about 472 billion board feet of virgin timber . Today there remain 240 billion board feet ? about 50 per cent of the original stand ! California is the nation 's biggest timber consumer and uses twice as much per capita as the United States as a whole . About a billion board feet annually go into box shook in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Last year , the state consumed nearly 6 billion board feet . It produced only 3 billion , however , of which it exported a billion . The rest came chiefly from the Northwest . The war and the post-war building boom have stepped up cutting to a new tempo : over 1000 sawmills are now operating , compared with 300 just before the war . In 1945 a legislative committee reported that the state 's virgin timber would " certainly not last more than fifty years , in many places a great deal less . " At the present rate of exploitation this would seem to be an optimistic forecast . Although California 's century of progress has taken half of her virgin timber , the cutover lands are not all ruined . It is estimated that one/third of the cutover forests still contain good ' stands of second growth and another third are slowly recovering . At least 3z million acres , however , must be reforested by long and costly artificial means or written off as worse than wasteland . About a decade ago the state awakened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it set about encouraging private loggers to mend their ways . In 1945 the legislature passed the Forest Practices Act ; a measure for self-regulation of the commercial forests that are privately owned . Codes of cutting practices were framed and adopted by the owners ,  | policed by the state , with the view of farming the forests instead of mining them . Opinions differ as to the success of this move . The big companies have caught the long-range vision and are cooperating fairly well . But the wildcatters or " gyppologgers , " activated by high prices , lease or buy a forest piece , cut everything that is marketable , and then move on to a new terrain . About twenty years ago the state had tackled that big foe of the woods ? forest and brush fire . This public enemy annually claims about 300,000 acres of timber , brush , and range in about 3800 fires each year , of which nine out of ten are mancaused . The state and Federal forest agencies are conducting a notable publicity campaign , for the purpose of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the careless incendiarism that is causing so much damage . Recently , California has expanded its State Park System , which today embraces more than 500,000 acres . Included in this system are 60,000 acres of ancient Coast Range redwoods , famed as Earth 's oldest and largest living things and the pride and joy of every Californian . The invasion of the loggers into these priceless groves has been less destructive than in the pine forests ; only 35 per cent of the original redwood stands have been cut over , in contrast with 70 per cent of private pine forests . A beginning also has been made in buying state forests , although this program is fairly puny in relation to similar ones in other states . California 's state forests embrace 70,500 acres , compared with Washington 's 290,000 , Oregon 's 519,000 , and even little Maryland 's 119,500 . The state has removed taxes for forty years on growing timber to encourage reforestation , but has done little toward supplying private owners with nursery stock at low cost , as is done in Michigan , New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owners , organized under the California Forest Protective Association , cooperate with state and Federal agencies in a program whose slogan is " Keep California Green and Golden . " The best work , undoubtedly , is being done in the National Forests , where logging is regulated , fireprotection systematized , and all the multiple purposes of the woods are more or less scientifically promoted . In California , Uncle Sam owns and operates eighteen National Forests , averaging about a million acres each . While these forests have one half of the state 's resources in saw timber , they produce , tinder selective cutting , " only one fifth of the lumber output . Their big contribution is the protection they afford to the ; watersheds . These eighteen great natural reservoirs yield nearly half of the annual runoff of 70 million acre-feet of water . This is the water supply for most of the homes and farms in the valleys below . It is also the water that creates , on its way to the valleys , nearly 13 billion kilowatt-hours of hydroelectricity , or 92 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these protected forests provide recreation for million people each year , sanctuary for a multi ' u of fish and wild game , grazing for cattle and sheep Ever stricter rules of regulation prevail in the ; million acres of the four big Federal playgrounds - the National Parks run by the Interior Department It is doubtful that the forest lands of California ever again will he able to produce all the timber the state needs . But if all the commerrtial forests were scientifically logged and managed ? each acre , say , producing 400 board feet a year ? Cal ' fornia could almost meet her own needs for a time to come . One University of California expert , Woodbridge Metcalf , claims that if all the state ' timber forests were put under good forest management , it would he possible to grow the 6 billi board feet the state is annually consuming . Ev if it did not , the effort and money required to pu all the state 's forests under sustained yield management would be more than repaid in the protection such a program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Theodore Roosevelt once said " A people without children would face a hopeless future ; a country without trees is almost as hopeless . " Among the ghosts of California 's vanished forest trees wander the ghosts of the forest 's wild creatures . California once abounded in wild life of all kinds , but not today . The state 's official emblem is the grizzly bear , a magnificent creature that now appears only on its Bear Flag . Gone or almost gone are other fabled fauna from the woodlands ? the golden beaver , that indefatigable first builder of flood-control dams ; the famous Sierra bighorn sheep that used to roam the highest of the high Sierras ; the elk and the prong-horned antelope ; the sharp-tailed grouse , the majestic California condor , the trumpeter swan . From the offshore sea have practically vanished the Guadalupe fur seal , the sturgeon , the sea otter ; and big inroads have been made into the once abundant stores of sardine , tuna , salmon , and other food fish . The state 's official fish is the golden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by reason of his inaccessibility to all but the hardiest sportsmen . " We have good reason to believe , " said Dr. E. P. Meinecke , noted plant pathologist , " that the elk and deer , the bear , and many other mammals , fish and birds , abounded in almost incredible numbers . In wild animals , California must have been one of the richest regions in the world . Today , that picture is no longer true . " 4 So MUCH for California 's diminishing organic wealth , much of which , through patient husbanding , could be restored . California 's mineral wealth also is going fast . The state truly has earned its  | title of the Golden State . In the past century there has been blasted , dug , panned , washed , dredged , and otherwise removed from its soil more than 2 billion dollars in gold . California also tops the nation as a producer of quicksilver . It has yielded great wealth in copper , silver , zinc , lead , and some sixty-odd other kinds of commercial minerals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of oil and gas . Second only to Texas in production and in known reserves of oil and gas , California has let from her veins nearly 8 billion barrels of petroleum , always lavishly and often wastefully . Known oil reserves today are estimated at 32 billion barrels . Under present methods and at the present rate of production , here is a supply sufficient to last about ten years ! Of course , this estimate does not account for possible new discoveries . Other developments , such as flushing old wells by water , may also prolong the life of the oil fields . So would importation of supplemental fuels , such as oil from shale or coal from Utah , now being discussed . So would full and early expansion of hydroelectric development , since by far the bigger portion of the private power companies ' expansion program is in gas and oil driven steam generation . The 8 billion kilowatt-hours of hydroelectricity which could be produced on Central Valley streams would conserve 15 million barrels of oil a year . But as of today , the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight , is certainly around the corner . Reed D. Bush , State Oil and Gas Supervisor , is the last man one would call an alarmist , but here is his story briefly told : ? " On December 31 , 1947 , California 's known oil reserves were 3,294,963,000 barrels . The wells are producing at the rate of 340,000,000 barrels a year . The known reserves are only ten times the annual production . While new discoveries may add materially to the supply , the prospect is we 're not going to have enough to supply the State , and that we 're going to have to import . It is predicted that we 'll not have enough new discoveries to fill the anticipated increased demand along with the current demand . Up to now California has been a heavy exporter and has supplied the entire Pacific area , as far west as Japan . We 'll soon be importing ? from Texas , Venezuela , or Saudi Arabia . " The natural gas story is hardly more cheerful . On January 1 , 1948 , California 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These are being drawn upon at the rate of 606 billion cubic feet a year . At that rate the supply will last twenty years . California already is importing 350 million cubic feet a day via pipeline from Texas and New Mexico , and an application has been made to the State Public Utilities Commission to build another line , carrying 300 million cubic feet . Incidentally , in September , 1929 , California wells were blowing into the air a billion cubic feet of natural gas a day . There are signs that California 's psychology is changing . Here and there voices are being raised against the theme of the boosters that here 's a land of eternal plenty , so come and get it . A gradual realization is spreading that there is a limit to the state 's abundance and that the purely " extractive economy " of the past must be rather speedily replaced by a modern , aggressive program of conservation , supported by all the people , in which the remaining natural wealth of the state is used wisely , capital is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrying out soil and water conservation programs on their agricultural land through Soil Conservation Districts . Today there are 58 Soil Conservation Districts embracing 41,372 farms in California , and the movement is spreading . Another hopeful sign conies from the State Department of Natural Resources , which has just set up an office for a Chief of Conservation Education to cooperate with the State Department of Education in a program of basic information for the school curricula . This movement is a recognition that the state 's key resource is in the minds and wills of its people , and that to condition their minds and wills the educators must begin with young minds clean of the old concepts . One can only wish that this movement had started a generation or two ago . " For the past hundred years we 've been taking things out , " said State Director of Natural Resources Warren T. Hannum . " Recently we 've been waking up to the fact that we must conserve and replenish our renewable natural wealth . We just ca n't afford another hundred years like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a land flowing with milk and honey . But so , we are told , were Mesopotamia , North Africa , and the vanished Yucatan of the Mayans.
