anger than confusion , except that to keep twins straight had fallen her lot . And it seemed to her that from now on , having a visit go the visitor 's way would come before giving trouble . She who had kicked Old Man Flewellyn out of the dewberry patch , an old smiling man ! She had set her teeth in a small pointed ear that had the fuzz of a peach , and did not bite . Then she rolled her head and dared the other twin , with her teeth at his ear , since they were all in this together , all in here equally now , where it had been quiet as moonrise to her , and now while one black crow after another beat his wings across a turned-over field no distance at all beyond . When they sat up in a circle with their skinned knees propped up in the playing light that came down like a fountain , she and the MacLain twins ate candy  --  as many sticks of candy as they felt like eating out of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought the sack away out here with them and had put it in a safe place ahead of time , as far from the scene as the pin oak  --  needlessly far . Their forethought cast a pall on all three as they sucked and held their candy in their mouths like old men 's pipes . One crow hollered over their heads and they all got to their feet as though a clock struck . " Now . " What did it matter which twin said that word , like a little bark ? It was the parting word . There was her hoe held up in a grandfather vine , gone a little further in its fall , and there was her bucket . After they 'd walked away from her  --  backwards for a piece  --  then she , jumping at them to chase them off , screamed into the veil of leaves , " I just did it because your mamma 's a poor albino ! " She would think afterwards , married , when she had the time to sit down  --  churning , for instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care , for fifteen ? They did . I did . But it was n't fair to tease me.  |p101To  try to make me dizzy , and run a ring around me , or make me think that first minute I was going to be carried off by their pa . Teasing because I had to open my mouth about Mr. King MacLain before I knew what was coming . " Tumbling on the wet spring ground with the goody-goody MacLain twins was something Junior Holifield would have given her a licking for , just for making such a story up , supposing , after she married Junior , she had put anything in words . Or he would have said he 'd lick her for it if she told it again . Poor Junior ! " Oh , good afternoon , sir . Do n't shoot me , it 's King MacLain . I 'm in the habit of hunting these parts . Junior had just knocked off a dead , double-headed pine cone and Blackstone was . aiming at the telephonewire when the light voice with the fast words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Thought I 'd see if the birds around here still tasted as sweet as they used to . " And there he was  --  that is , he showed for a minute and then was gone behind a reddening sweetgum tree . But fall coming or not , poor little quails were n't any of his business , with him darting around tree trunks in a starched white suit , even if he did carry a gun for looks , Mattie Will thought . She studied the empty arch between two trees with a far-sighted look . If that was Mr. King MacLain , nobody was ever going to shoot him . Shoot him ? Let him go on ahead in his Sunday best from one tree to another without giving warning or being so fussy about wild shots from the low scrub . He was Mr. King , all right . Up there back of the leaves his voice laughed and made fun this minute . Junior looked up and said , " Well , we come out top102use up some old ammunition . " He lifted his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind . He pinged it . " You hear me ? " said the voice . " It sure did look like Mr. MacLain to me , junior , " Mattie Will whispered , pretending to be as slow as Junior was . She squinted against the small sun points that came at her cheeks through the braid of her hat . Then she pushed her way around her husband . " Well . And we come out to shoot up some old ammunitionon Saturday , " Junior told her . " This is Saturday . " He pulled her back . " You boys been sighting any birds this way ? " the white glimmer asked courteously , and then it passed behind another tree . " Seen my dog , then ? " And the invisible mouth whistled , from east right around to west , they could hear the clean round of it . Mr. King even whistled with manners . And with familiarity . And what two men in the world whistle the same ? Mattie Will believed she must have heard him and seen him closer-to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweet the old rascal whistled , but it did n't surprise her . Wilbur , the Holifield dog , flailed his tail and took a single bound toward the bank . Of course he had been barking the whole time , answered tolerantly by some dogs in town who  --  as certainly as if you could see them  --  were lying in front of the barbershop . " Sighted e'er bird ? Just one cuckoo , " junior said now , with his baby-mouth drawn down as if he would cry , which meant he was being funny , and so Blackstone , his distance behind in the plum thicket , hopped on one foot for Junior , but Junior said , " Be still , Blackstone , no call for you to start cutting up yet . " " No , sir . Never pass by these parts without bringingdown a few plump , juicy birds for my supper , " said the voice . It was far-away for the moment ; Mr. MacLain must have turned and looked at the viewp103from the hilltop . You could see all Morgana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own house . " My name is Holifield . We was just out using up some old ammunition on Saturday , me and a nigger . And as long as you do n't get no closer to us , we ai n't liable to hit you , " said Junior . That echoed a little . They both happened to get behind gum trees just then , Mr. MacLain and Junior . Junior was behind a tree ! And she was between them . Mattie Will put her hand over her laughing mouth . Blackstone in the thicket broke a stick and chunked the pieces in the air . " And we wo n't pay no attention what you do in your part of the woods , " Junior said , a dignified gaze on the falling chips . " Suits me , sir ! " " Truth is  --  = " Junior always kept right on ! Just as he would do eating , at the table , and to his sorrow . " I ai n't prepared to believe you come after birds , hardly , Mr. MacLain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after what birds they is , if they is any birds . You 're trespassing . " " Trespassing , " said the voice presently . " Well  --  do n't shoot me for that . " " Oho ho , Mr. Junior ! Know what ? He gawn shoot us ! Shoot us ! " In the ecstasy of knowing the end of it ahead of time , Blackstone flew out in the open and sang it like a bird , and beat his pants . " You hush up , or if he do n't shoot you , I will , " Junior said . " Look , what happened to your gun , you lost it agin ? " Mr. MacLain was moving waywardly along , and sometimes got as completely hidden by even a skinny little wild cherry as if he 'd melted into it . Ping ! " One more redbird ! " sighed Mattie Will . " Ai n't we two hunting men letting each other by and about their own business ? " asked Mr. MacLain , suddenly loud upon them . They saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the gully , one hand on a knee . " Look  --  this is the stretch of woods I al/ways did like the best . Why do n't you try a differentstretch ? " " See there ? " Mr. MacLain laughed agreeably at accusation . " There 's something else ai n't what you think , " Junior said in his most Holifield way . " Ai n't e'er young lady foiling after me , that you can catch a holt of  --  white or black . " Wilbur spraddled right up the bank to Mr. MacLainsuddenly , before they knew it , and fawned on him before they got him back . He was named Wilburafter Mr. Morrison , who had printed Mattie Will 's and Junior 's marriage in the newspaper . Mr. MacLain withdrew , and Junior was patting Wilbur , hammer-like . " Junior , " Mattie Will called softly through the cup of her hand . " Looks like you really scared that man away . Wonder who he was ? " " Bless God . Come out in the open , young lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. MacLain called , appearing immediately from the waist up . So poor Junior had got one thing right . Mr. MacLainhad been counting on it all the time  --  that young girl-wives not tied down yet could generally be found following after their husbands , if the husbands went out with a .22 on a nice enough day in October . " Wo n't you come out and explain something mysteriousto me , young lady ? " But it sounded as if he 'd just thought of it , and called it mysterious . Mattie Will , who was crouched to her knees , bent her head . She took a June bug off a leaf , a late June bug . She was thinking to herself , Mr. MacLain must be up in years , and they said he never did feel constrained to live in Morgana like other people and just visited Mrs. MacLain a little now and then . He roamed the country end on end , living up north and where-all , on funds ; and might at any time appearand then , over night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close ?  | " Show yourself , young lady . Are you a Holifield too ? I do n't think you are . Come out here and let me ask you something . " But he went bobbing on to anothertree while he was cajoling , bright as a lantern that swayed in a wind . " Show yourself and I 'll brain you directly , Mattie Will , " Junior said . " You heard who he said he was and you done heard what he was , all your life , or you ai n't a girl . " Junior squeezed up to his .22 and trained it , immediately changing his voice to a little high singsong . " He 's the one gits ever'thing he wants shootin ' from around trees , like the MacLains been doing since Time . Killed folks trespassin ' when he was growin ' up , or his pa did , if it so pleased him . MacLains begun killin ' when they begun settlin ' . And do n't nobody know how many chirren he has . Do n't let him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you all . " Mattie Will ran the June bug up and down her arm and remembered once when she was little and her mother and father had both been taken with the prevalent sickness , and it was Mrs. MacLain from Morgana  --  who before that was known only by sight to her  --  who had come out to the farm and nursed and cooked for them , since there was nobody . She served them light-bread toast , and not biscuit , and did n't believe in molasses . She was not afraid of all the mud . She was in the congregation , always , a sweet-looking Presbyterian albino lady . Nothing was her fault . Mrs. MacLain came by herself to church , without boy or man , her lace collar fastened down by a cluster-pearl pin just like a little ice cream spoon , loaded . Going down the aisle she held up her head for the benefit of them all , while they consideredMr . MacLain a thousand miles away . And when they sang in church with her , they might as well have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles away . " It made church holier.  | " I 'll just start up that little bank till I see what he 's after , Junior , " Mattie Will said , rising . Junior just looked at her stubbornly . She pinched him . " Did n't you hear him ask me a question ? Do n't be so country : I 'm going to answer it . And who 's trespassing , if it 's not us all three and a nigger ? These whole woods belongs to you know who , Old Lady Stark . She 'd like to see us all in Coventrythis minute . " She pointed overhead , without looking , where the signs said , Posted . No Pigs With or Without Rings . No Hunting . This Means You . STARKWhile he looked at those , and even Mr. MacLain looked at them , Mattie Will made her way up the bank . " You see ? " Junior cried again . " Yonder comes MattieWill . It 's just a good thing I got my gun too , Mr. MacLain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you was near enough to flush out , Mr. MacLain . You back to stay ? Come on , Blackstone , let 's me and you shoot him right now if he budges to catch a holt of Mattie Will , do n't care what happens to us or who we hit , whether we both go to the ' lectric chair or not . " Mr. MacLain then looked out from a pin oak and fired a load of buckshot down , the way he 'd throw a bone . Mattie Will 's tongue ran out too , to show Junior how he 'd acted in public . Blackstone was howling out from his plum thicket , ' Now it be 's our turn and I found my old gun and we done used up every bit of ammunition we had on turtles an ' trash ! You see , you see . " Mattie Will looked up at Mr. MacLain and he beamed at her . He sent another load out , this one down over her where she held to some roots on the bank , and right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hole shamed it all over , blush-like . Junior threw away his gun . Big red hand spread out on his shirt ( he would always think he was shot through the heart if anybody'sgun but his went off ) , Junior rose in the air and got a holler out . And then he seemed determinedabout the way to come down , like Mister Holifielddown from a ladder ; no man more set in his ways than he , even Mister Holifield  --  he kicked and came down backwards . There was a fallen tree , a big fresh-cut magnolia some good-for-nothing had amused himself chopping down . Across that junior decided to light , instead of on green moss  --  head and body on one side of the tree , feet and legs on the other . Then he went limp from the middle out , before their eyes . He was dead to the world ; as immune as if asleep in his pew , but bent the opposite way . Mr. MacLain appeared on top of the gully , wearing a yellowy Panama hat and a white linen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He looked like the preternatural month of June . He came light of foot and let his gunstock trail carefree through the periwinkle , which would bind it a little and then let go . He went to Junior first , taking the bank in three or four knee-deep steps down . He bent over and laid his ear to Junior . He thumped him , like a melon he tested , and let him lie  --  too green . As if lighting a match from his side , he drew a finger down Junior 's brown pants leg , and stepped away . Mr. MacLain 's linen shoulders , white as a goose 's back in the sun , shrugged and twinkled in the glade . To his back , he was not so very big , not so flashy and splendid as , for example , some brand-new evangelistcome into the midst . He turned around and threw off his hat , and showed a thatch of straight , biscuit-colored hair . He smiled . His puckered face was like a little boy 's , with square brown teeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with head cocked while the wind swelled and blew across the top of the ridge , turning over the green and gold leaves high up around them all , stirringalong suspicions of burning leaves and gunpowdersmoke and the juice of the magnolia , and then he dropped his gun flat in the vines . Mattie Will saw he was coming now . " Turn your self around and start picking plums ! " she called , joining her hands , and Blackstone turned around , just in time . When she laid eyes on Mr. MacLain close , she staggered , he had such grandeur , and then she was caught by the hair and brought down as suddenly to earth as if whacked by an unseen shillelagh . Presently she lifted her eyes in a lazy dread and saw those eyes above hers , as keenly bright and unwavering and apart from her life as the flowers on a tree . But he put on her , with the affront of his body , the affront of his sense too . No pleasure in that ! She had to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he was so grand it was a thorn to him . Like submitting to another way to talk , she could answer to his burden now , his whole blithe , smiling , superior , frantic existence . And no matter what happened to her , she had to remember , disappointments are not to be borne by Mr. MacLain , or he 'll go away again . Now he clasped her to his shoulder , and her tongue tasted sweet starch for the last time . Her arms dropped back to the mossiness , and she was Mr. MacLain'sDoom , or Mr. MacLain 's Weakness , like the rest , and neither Mrs. Junior Holifield nor Mattie Will Sojourner ; now she was something she had always heard of . She did not stir . Then when he let her fall and walked off , when he was out of hearing in the woods , and the birds and woods-sounds and the wood-chopping throbbed clearly , she lay there on one elbow , wide awake . A dove feather came turning down through the light that was like golden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and brushed her chin ; she was never displeasedto catch anything . Nothing more fell . But she moved . She was the mover in the family . She jumped up . Besides , she heard plums falling into the bucket sounds of pure complaint by this time . She threw Blackstone a glance . He picked plums and had a lizard to play with , and his cap unretrievedfrom his first sailing delight still hung in a tree . The Holifield dog licked Blackstone on the seat patch and then trotted over and licked Junior on the stone-like hand , and looked back over his shoulder with the expression of a lady soloist to whose song nobody has really listened . For ages he might have been making a little path back and forth between Junior and Blackstone , but she could not think of his name , or would not , just as Junior would not wake up . She was n't going to call a one of them , man or dog , to his senses . There was Junior suspended dead to the world over a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half as willful . He was hooped in the middlelike the bridge over Little Chunky . Fools could set foot on him , walk over him . Even a young mule could run across him , the one he wanted to buy . His old brown pants hung halfway up his legs , and there in his poky middle pitifully gleamed the belt buckle anybody would know him by , even in a hundred years . J for Junior . A pang reached her and she took a step . It could be he was scared more than half to death  --  but no , not with that sleeping face , still with its look of " How come ? " , or its speckled lashes , quiet as the tails of sitting birds , in the shade of his brow . " Let the church bells wake him ! " said Mattie Will to Wilbur . " Ai n't tomorrow Sunday ? Blackstone , you have your cap to climb up after . " In the woods she heard sounds , the dry creek beginning to run or a strange man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but she walked right up on Mr. MacLain again , asleep  --  snoring . He slept sitting up with his back against a tree , his head pillowed in the luminous Panama , his snorting mouth drawn round in a perfect heart open to the green turning world around him . She stamped her foot , nothing happened , then she approached softly , and down on hands and knees contemplated him . Her hair fell over her eyes and she steadily blew a part in it ; her head went back and forth appearing to say " No . " Of course she was not denying a thing in this world , but now had time to look at anything she pleased and study it . With her almost motherly sway of the head and arms to help her , she gazed at the sounding-off , sleepinghead , and the neck like a little porch column in town , at the one hand , the other hand , the bent leg and the straight , all those parts looking no more driven than her man 's now , or of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the mill and left in the pit to dry . But they were , and would be . He snored as if all the frogs of spring were inside him  --  but to him an old song . Or to him little balls , little bells for the light air , that rose up and sank between his two hands , never to be let fall . His coat hung loosely out from him , and a letter suddenly dropped a little way out from a pocket  --  whiter than white . Mattie Will subsided forward onto her arms . Her rear stayed up in the sky , which seemed to brush it with little feathers . She lay there and listened to the world go round . But presently Mr. MacLain leaped to his feet , bolt awake , with a flourish of legs . He looked horrified  --  that he had been seen asleep ? and by Mattie Will ? And he did not know that there was nothing she could or would take away from him  --  Mr. King Mac-Lain ? In the night time , At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the habit of Sir Rabbit To dance in the woodThat was all that went through Mattie Will 's head . " What you doing here , girl ? " Mr. MacLain beat his snowy arms up and down . " Go on ! Go on off ! Go to Guinea ! " She got up and skedaddled . She pressed through a haw thicket and through the cherry trees . With a tree-high seesawing of boughs a squirrel chase ran ahead of her through the woods  --  Morgan 's Woods , as it used to be called . Fat birds were rocking on their perches . A little quail ran on the woods floor . Down an arch , some old cedar lane up here , Mattie Will could look away into the big West . She could see the drift of it all , the stretched land below the little hills , and the Big Black , clear to MacLain 's Courthouse , almost , the Stark place plain and the fields , and their farm , everybody 's house above trees , the MacLains '  --  the white floating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where there had been a murder one time . And Morgana all in rays , like a giant sunflower in the dust of Saturday . But as she ran down through the woods and vines , this side and that , on the way to get junior home , it stole back into her mind about those two gawky boys , the MacLain twins . They were soft and jumpy ! That day , with their brown , bright eyes popping and blinking , and their little aching Adam 's apples  --  they were like young deer , or even remoter creatures . . . kangaroos . . . . For the first time Mattie Will thought they were mysterious and sweet  --  gamboling now she knew not where.  |p112From  the beginning his martyred presence seriously affected them : They had a disquieting familiarity with it , hearing the spit of his despising that went into his bugle . At times they could hardly recognize what he thought he was playing . Loch Morrison , Boy Scout and Life Saver , was under the ordeal of a week 's camp on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orphans , wished on them by Mr. Nesbitt and the Men 's Bible Class after Billy Sunday 's visit to town ; but all girls , orphans and Morganagirls alike , were the same thing to Loch ; maybe he threw in the two councilors too . He was hating every day of the seven . He hardly spoke ; he never spoke first . Sometimes he swung in the trees ; Nina Carmichael in particular would hear him crashing in the foliage somewhere when she was lying rigid in siesta . While they were in the lake , for the dip or the fiveo'clockswimming period in the afternoon , he stood against a tree with his arms folded , jacked up onelegged , sitting on his heel , as absolutely tolerant as an old fellow waiting for the store to open , being held up by the wall . Waiting for the girls to get out , he gazed upon some undisturbed part of the water . He despised their predicaments , most of all their not beingable to swim . Sometimes he would take aim and from his right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they never were . Then he re/sumed his pose . He had been roped into this by his mother . At the hours too hot for girls he used Moon Lake . He dived high off the crosspiece nailed up in the big oak , where the American Legion dived . He went through the air rocking and jerking like an engine , splashed in , climbed out , spat , climbed up again , dived off . He wore a long bathing suit which stretched longer from Monday to Tuesday and from Tuesday to Wednesday and so on , yawning at the armholes toward infinity , and it looked black and formal as a mistrel suit as he stood skinny against the clouds as on a stage . He came and got his food and turned his back and ate it all alone like a dog and lived in a tent by himself , apart like a nigger , and dived alone when the lake was clear of girls . That way , he seemed able to bear it ; that would be his life . In early evening , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept far away . They would sing " When all the little ships come sailing home , " and he would be roaming off ; they could tell about where he was . He played taps for them , invisibly then , and so beautifully they wept together , whole tentfuls some nights . Off with the whip-poor-wills and the coons and the owls and the little bobwhites  --  down where it all sloped away , he had pitched his tent , and slept there . Then at reveille , how he would spit into that cornet . Reveille was his . He harangued the woods when the little minnows were trembling and running wizardlikein the water 's edge . And how lovely and alteredthe trees were then , weighted with dew , leaning on one another 's shoulders and smelling like big wet flowers . He blew his horn into their presence  --  trees ' and girls '  --  and then watched the Dip . " Good morning , Mr. Dip , Dip , Dip , with your water just as cold as ice ! " sang Mrs. Gruenwald hoarsely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moody said she could n't , simply could n't . The orphans usually hung to the rear , and every other moment stood swayback with knees locked , the shoulders of their wash dresses ironed flat and stuck in peaks , and stared . For swimming they owned no bathing suits and went in in their underbodies . Even in the water they would stand swayback , each with a fist in front of her over the rope , looking over the flat surface as over the top of a tall mountain none of them could ever get over . Even at this hour of the day , they seemed to be expecting little tasks , something more immediate  --  little tasks that were never given out . Mrs. Gruenwald was from the North and said ' dup . " " Good morning , Mr. Dup , Dup , Dup , with your water just as cold as ice ! " sang Mrs. Gruenwald , fatly capering and leading them all in a singing , petering-out string down to the lake . She did a sort of little rocking dance in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the line she looked like a Shredded Wheat Biscuit box rocking on its corners . Nina Carmichael thought , There is nobody and nothing named Mr. Dip , it is not a good morning untilyou have had coffee , and the water is the temperatureof a just-cooling biscuit , thank Goodness . I hate this little parade of us girls , Nina thought , trotting fiercely in the center of it . It ruins the woods , all right . " Gee , we think you 're mighty nice , they sang to Mr. Dip , while the Boy Scout , waiting at the lake , watched them go in . " Watch out for mosquitoes , " they called to one another , lyrically because warning was n't any use anyway , as they walked out of their kimonos and dropped them like the petals of one big scattered flower on the bank behind them , and exposing themselvesfelt in a hundred places at once the little pangs . The orphans ripped their dresses off over their heads and stood in their underbodies . Busily they hung and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own number , like a whole flock of ferocious little birds with pale topknots buildingp115themselves a nest . The orphan named Easter appeared in charge . She handed her dress wrong-sideoutto a friend , who turned it and hung it up for her , and waited standing very still , her little fingers locked . " Let 's let the orphans go in the water first and get the snakes stirred up , Mrs. Guenwald , " Jinny Love Stark suggested first off , in the cheerful voice she adopted toward grown people . " Then they 'll be chased away by the time we go in . " That made the orphans scatter in their pantiewaists , outwards from Easter ; the little gauzes of gnats they ran through made them beat their hands at the air . They ran back together again , to Easter , and stood excitedly , almost hopping . " I think we 'll all go in in one big bunch , " Mrs. Gruenwald said . Jinny Love lamented and beat against Mrs. Gruenwald , Mrs. Gruenwald 's solid , rope-draped stomach all but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Into the water ! Do n't let the stobs and cypress roots break your legs ! Do your best ! Kick ! Stay on top if you can and hold the rope if necessary ! " Mrs. Gruenwald abruptly walked away from Jinny Love , out of the bathrobe , and entered the lake with a vast displacing . She left them on the bank with her Yankee advice . The Morgana girls might never have gone in if the orphans had n't balked . Easter came to a dead stop at Moon Lake and looked at it squinting as though it floated really on the Moon . And might n't it be on the Moon ?  --  it was a strange place , Nina thought , unlikely  --  andthree miles from Morgana , Mississippi , all the time . The Morgana girls pulled the orphans ' hands and dragged them in , or pushed suddenly from behind , and finally the orphans took hold of one anotherand waded forward in a body , singing , " Good Morning " with their stiff , chip-like lips . None of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood waistdeepand waited for the dip to be over . A few of themp116reached out and caught the struggling Morgana girls by the legs as they splashed from one barky post to another , to see how hard it really was to stay up . " Mrs. Gruenwald , look , they want to drown us . " But Mrs. Gruenwald all this time was rising and sinking like a whale , she was in a sea of her own waves and perhaps of self-generated cold , out in the middle of the lake . She cared little that Morgana girls who learned to swim were getting a dollar from home . She had deserted them , no , she had never really been with them . Not only orphans had she deserted . In the water she kept so much to the profile that her single pushing-out eyeball looked like a little bottle of something . It was said she believed in evolution . While the Boy Scout in the rosy light under the green trees twirled his horn so that it glittered and ran a puzzle in the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yawned , snappingly  --  as if he would bite the day , as quickly as Easter had bitten Deacon Nesbitt 's hand on Opening Day . " Gee , we think you 're mighty nice , " they sang to Mr. Dip , gasping , pounding their legs in him . If they let their feet go down , the invisible bottom of the lake felt like soft , knee-deep fur . The sharp hard knobs came up where least expected . The Morgana girls of course wore bathing slippers , and the mud loved to suck them off . The alligators had been beaten out of this lake , but it was said that water snakes  --  pilots  --  were swimming here and there ; they would bite you but not kill you ; and one cottonmouth moccasin was still getting away from the niggers  --  if the niggers were still going after him ; he would kill you . These were the chances of getting sucked under , of being bitten , and of dying three miles away from home . The brown water cutting her off at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unsmiling . Before she could hold a stare like that , she would have had to swallow something big  --  so Nina felt . It would have been something so big that it did n't mat/ter to her what the inside of a snake 's mouth was lined with . At the other end of her gaze the life saver grew almost insignificant . Her gaze moved like a little switch or wand , and the life saver scratched himself with his bugle , raked himself , as if that eased him . Yet the flick of a blue-bottle fly made Easter jump . They swam and held to the rope , hungry and waiting . But they had to keep waiting till Loch Morrison blew his horn before they could come out of Moon Lake . Mrs. Gruenwald , who capered before breakfast , believed in evolution , and put her face in the water , was quarter of a mile out . If she said anything , they could n't hear her for the frogs . Nina and Jinny Love , with the soles of their feet shocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the spring . For the orphans , from the first , sniffed out the way to the spring by themselves , and they could get there without stops to hold up their feet and pull out thorns and stickers , and could run through the sandy bottomsand never look down where they were going , and could grab hold with their toes on the sharp rutted path up the pine ridge and down . They clearly could never get enough of skimming over the silkslickneedles and setting prints of their feet in the bed of the spring to see them dissolve away under their eyes . What was it to them if the spring was muddiedby the time Jinny Love Stark got there ? The one named Easter could fall flat as a boy , elbowscocked , and drink from the cup of her hand with her face in the spring . Jinny Love prodded Nina , and while they looked on Easter 's drawers , Nina was opening the drinking cup she had brought with her , then collapsing it , feeling like a lady with a fan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fact : Half the people out here with me are orphans . Orphans . Orphans . She yearned for her heart to twist . But it did n't ,  |p118not  in time . Easter was through drinking  --  wiping her mouth and flinging her hand as if to break the bones , to get rid of the drops , and it was Nina 's turn with her drinking cup . Nina stood and bent over from the waist . Calmly , she held her cup in the spring and watched it fill . They could all see how it spangled like a cold star in the curling water . The water tasted the silver cool of the rim it went over running to her lips , and at momentsthe cup gave her teeth a pang . Nina heard her own throat swallowing . She paused and threw a smile about her . After she had drunk she wiped the cup on her tie and collapsed it , and put the little top on , and its ring over her finger . With that , Easter , one arm tilted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt her surveying the spring and all from above . Jinny Love was down drinking like a chicken , kissing the water only . Easter was dominant among the orphans . It was not that she was so bad . The one called Geneva stole , for example , but Easter was dominant for what she was in herself  --  for the way she held still , sometimes . All orphans were at once wondering and stoic  --  at one moment loving everything too much , the next folding back from it , tightly as hard green buds growing in the wrong direction , closing as they go . But it was as if Easter signaled them . Now she just stood up there , watching the spring , with the name Easter  --  tacky name , as Jinny Love Stark was the first to say . She was medium size , but her hair seemed to fly up at the temples , being cropped and wiry , and this crest made her nearly as tall as Jinny Love Stark . The rest of the orphans had hair paler than their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cornsilk that dimmed black at the roots and shadows , with burnt-out-looking bangs like young boys ' and old men 's hair ; that was from picking in the fields . Easter 's hair was a withstanding gold . Around the back of her neck beneath the hair was a dark band on her skin like the mark a gold braceletp119leaves on the arm . It came to the Morgana girls with a feeling of elation : the ring was pure dirt . They liked to look at it , or to remember , too late , what it was  --  as now , when Easter had already lain down for a drink and left the spring . They liked to walk behind her and see her back , which seemed spectacular from crested gold head to hard , tough heel . Mr. Nesbitt , from the Bible Class , took Easter by the wrist and turned her around to him and looked just as hard at her front . She had started her breasts . What Easter did was to bite his right hand , his collection hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , so far , or provenly , bad . When Nina 's little lead-mold umbrella , the size of a clover , a Crackerjackprize , was stolen the first night of camp , that was Geneva , Easter 's friend . Jinny Love , after wiping her face with a handmade handkerchief , pulled out a deck of cards she had secretly brought in her middy pocket . She dropped them down , bright blue , on a sandy place by the spring . " Let 's play cassino . Do they call you Easter ? " Down Easter jumped , from the height of the bank . She came back to them . " Cassino , what 's that ? " " All right , what do you want to play ? " " All right , I 'll play you mumblety-peg . " " I do n't know how you play that ! " cried Nina . " Who would ever want to know ? " asked Jinny Love , closing the circle . Easter flipped out a jack-knife and with her sawed fingernail shot out three blades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Jinny Love asked with some respect . Easter dropped to her scarred and coral-colored knees . They saw the dirt . " Get down if you want to play me mumblety-peg , " was all she said , " and watch out for your hands and faces . " They huddled down on the piney sand . The vivid , hurrying ants were everywhere . To the squinted eye they looked like angry , orange ponies as they rode the pine needles . There was Geneva , skirting behind a tree , but she never came close or tried to get in the game . She pretended to be catching doodlebugs . The knife leaped and quivered in the sandy arena smoothed by Easter 's hand . " I may not know how to play , but I bet I win , " Jinny Love said . Easter 's eyes , lifting up , were neither brown nor green nor cat ; they had something of metal , flat ancientmetal , so that you could not see into them . Nina 's grandfather had possessed a box of coins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have come from Greece or Rome that day . Jinny Love stopped short of apprehending this , and only took care to watch herself when Easter pitched the knife . The color in Easter 's eyes could have been found somewhere , away  --  away , under lost leaves  --  strange as the painted color of the ants . Instead of round black holes in the center of her eyes , there might have been women 's heads , ancient . Easter , who had played so often , won . She nodded and accepted Jinny Love 's barrette and from Nina a blue jay feather which she transferred to her own ear . " I would n't be surprised if you cheated , and do n't know what you had to lose if you lost , " said Jinny Love thoughtfully but with an admiration almost fantastic in her . Victory with a remark attached did not crush Easterat all , or she scarcely listened . Her indifference made Nina fall back and listen to the spring running with an endless sound and see how the July light like purple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind blew . Easter turned her head and the new feather on her head shone changeably . A black funnel of bees passed through the air , throwing a funneled shadow , like a visitor from nowhere , another planet . " We have to play again to see whose the drinking cup will be , " Easter said , swaying forward on her knees . Nina jumped to her feet and did a cartwheel.  |p121Against  the spinning green and blue her heart pounded as heavily as she touched lightly . " You ruined the game , " Jinny Love informed Easter . " You do n't know Nina . " She gathered up her cards . " You 'd think it was made of fourteen-carat gold , and did n't come out of the pocket of an old suitcase , that cup . " " I 'm sorry , " said Nina sincerely . As the three were winding around the lake , a bird flying above the opposite shore kept uttering a cry and then diving deep , plunging into the trees there , and soaring to cry again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fishing on the bank ; it was Elberta 's sister Twosie , who spoke as if a long , long conversation had been going on , into which she would intrude only the mildest words . " Know why ? Know why , in de sky , he say Spirit ? Spirit ? ' And den he dive boom and say ' GHOST ' ? " " Why does he ? " said Jinny Love , in a voice of objection . " Yawl knows . I do n't know , " said Twosie , in her little high , helpless voice , and she shut her eyes . They could n't seem to get on by her . On fine days there is danger of some sad meeting , the positive danger of it . " I do n't know what he say dat for . " Twosie spoke pitifully , as though accused . She sighed . " Yawl sho ai n't got yo ' eyes opem good , yawl . Yawl do n't know what 's out here in woods wid you . " " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great big gun , could jump out at yawl . Yawl do n't eem smellim . " " You mean Mr. Holifield ? That 's a flashlight he 's got . " Nina looked at Jinny Love for confirmation . Mr. Holifield was their handy man , or rather simply " the man to be sure and have around the camp . " He could be found by beating for a long time on the porch of the American Legion boat house  --  he slept heavily . " He has n't got a gun to jump out with . " " I know who you mean . I hear those boys . JustpI22 some big boys , like the MacLain twins or somebody , and who cares about them ? " Jinny Love , with her switch indented the thick mat of hair on Twosie 's head and prodded and stirred it gently . She pretended to fish in Twosie 's woolly head . " Why ai n't you scared , then ? " " I is . " Twosie 's eyelids fluttered . Already she seemed to be fishing in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , devoted figure , from which the long pole hung , so steady and beggarlike and ordained an appendage , all their passions flew home again and went huddled and soft to roost . Back at the camp , Jinny Love told Miss Moody about the great big jack-knife . Easter gave it up . " I did n't mean you could n't drink out of my cup , " Nina said , waiting for her . " Only you have to hold it carefully , it leaks . It 's engraved . " Easter would n't even try it , though Nina dangled it on its ring right under her eyes . She did n't say anything , not even " It 's pretty . " Was she even thinking of it ? Or if not , what did she think about ? " Sometimes orphans act like deaf-and-dumbs , " said Jinny Love . " Nina ! " Jinny Love whispered across the tent , during siesta . " What do you think you 're reading ? " Nina closed The Re-Creation of Brian Kent . JinnyLove was already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , walking on her knees and bearing down over Gertrude , Etoile , and now Geneva . With Jinny Love upon her , Geneva sighed . Her sleeping face looked as if she did n't want to . She slept as she swam , in her pantie-waist , she was in running position and her ribs went up and down frantically  --  a little box in her chest that expanded and shut without a second 's rest between . Her cheek was pearly with afternoon moisture and her kitten-likep123teeth pearlier still . As Jinny Love hid her and went over , Nina seemed to see her still ; even her vaccinationmark looked too big for her . Nobody woke up from being walked over , but after Jinny Love had fallen in bed with Nina , Easter gave a belated , dreaming sound . She had not even been in the line of march ; she slept on the cot by the door , curved shell-like , both arms forward over her head . It was an inward sound she gave  --  now it came again  --  of such wholehearted and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jinny Love took hands and made wry faces at each other . Beyond Easter 's cot the corona of afternoon flared and lifted in an intensity that came through the eyelids . There was nothing but light out there . True , the black Negroes inhabited it . Elberta moved slowly through it , as if she rocked a baby with her hips , carrying a bucket of scraps to throw in the lake  --  to get hail Columbia for it later . Her straw hat spiraled rings of orange and violet , like a top . Far , far down a vista of intolerable light , a tiny daub of black cotton , Twosiehad stationed herself at the edge of things , and slept and fished . Eventually there was Exum wandering with his fish pole  --  he could dance on a dime , Elberta said , he used to work for a blind man . Exum was smart for twelve years old ; too smart . He found that hat he wore  --  not a sign of the owner . He had a hat like new , filled out a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size , and he like a little black peanut in it . It stood up and away from his head all around , and seemed only following him  --  on runners , perhaps , like those cartridges for change in Spights ' store . Easter 's sighs and her prolonged or half-uttered words now filled the tent , just as the heat filled it . Her words fell in threes , Nina observed , like the mourning dove 's call in the woods . Nina and Jinny Love lay speechless , doubling for themselves the already strong odor of Sweet Dreams Mosquito Oil , in a trance of endurance through the hour 's siesta . Entwined , they stared  --  orphan-like themselves  --  past Easter 's cot and through the tent opening as down a long telescope turned on an incandescentstar , and saw the spiral of Elberta 's hat return , and saw Exum jump over a stick and on the other side do a little dance in a puff of dust . They could hear the intermittent crash , splash of Loch Morrison using their lake , and Easter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words . But however Nina and Jinny Love made faces at they knew not what , Easter concurred ; she thoroughly agreed . The bugle blew for swimming . Geneva jumped so hard she fell off her cot . Nina and Jinny Love were indented with each other , like pressed leaves , and jumped free . When Easter , who had to be shaken , sat up drugged and stupid on her cot , Nina ran over to her . " Listen . Wake up . Look , you can go in in my bathingshoes today . " She felt her eyes glaze with this plan of kindness as she stretched out her limp red shoes that hung down like bananas under Easter 's gaze . But Easter dropped back on the cot and stretched her legs . " Never mind your shoes . I do n't have to go in the lake if I do n't want to . " " You do . I never heard of that . Who picked you out ? You do , " they said , all gathering . " You make me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolled them back  --  she loved doing that . Miss Moody passed by and beamed in at them hovered around Easter 's passive and mutinous form . All along she 'd been afraid of some challenge to her counselorship , from the way she hurried by now , almost too daintily . " Well , I know , " Jinny Love said , sidling up . " I know as much as you know , Easter . " She made a chant , which drove her hopping around the tent pole in an Indian step . " You do n't have to go , if you do n't wantp125to go . And if it ai n't so , you still do n't have to go , if you do n't want to go . " She kissed her hand to them . Easter was silent  --  but if she groaned when she waked , she 'd only be imitating herself. finny Love pulled on her bathing cap , which gave way and came down over her eyes . Even in blindness , she cried , " So you need n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What do you say to that ? " " I should worry , I should cry , " said Easter , lying still , spread-eagled . " Let 's us run away from basket weaving , " Jinny Love said in Nina 's ear , a little later in the week . " Just as soon . " " Grand . They 'll think we 're drowned . " They went out the back end of the tent , barefooted ; their feet were as tough as anybody 's by this time . Down in the hammock , Miss Moody was readingThe Re-Creation of Brian Kent now . ( Nobodyknew whose book that was , it had been found here , the covers curled up like side combs . Perhaps anybodyat Moon Lake who tried to read it felt cheated by the title , as applying to camp life , as Nina did , and laid it down for the next person . ) Cat , the niggers ' cat , was sunning on a post and when they approachedjumped to the ground like something poured out of a bottle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trudged down the slope past Loch Morrison'stent and took the track into the swamp . There they moved single file between two walls ; by lifting their arms they could have touched one or the other pressing side of the swamp . Their toes exploded the dust that felt like the powder clerks pump into new kid gloves , as Jinny Love said twice . They were eye to eye with the finger-shaped leaves of the castor bean plants , put out like those gypsy hands that part the curtains at the back of rolling wagons , and wrinkled and coated over like the fortune-teller 's face . Mosquitoes struck at them ; Sweet Dreams didn't last . The whining lifted like a voice , saying " I do n't want . . . " At the girls ' shoulders Queen Anne 's lace and elderberry and blackberry thickets , loaded heavilywith flower and fruit and smelling with the melonysmell of snake , overhung the ditch to touch them . The ditches had dried green or blue bottoms , cracked and glazed  --  like a dropped vase . " I hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Love said cheerfully . Sweet bay and cypress and sweetgum and live oak and swamp maple closing tight made the wall dense , and yet there was somewhere still for the other wall of vine ; it gathered itself on the ground and stacked and tilted itself in the trees ; and like a table in the tree the mistletoe hung up there black in the zenith . Buzzards floated from one side of the swamp to the other , as if choice existed for them  --  raggedly crossing the sky and shadowing the track , and shoulderingone another on the solitary limb of a moonwhitesycamore . Closer to the ear than lips could beginwords came the swamp sounds  --  closer to the ear and nearer to the dreaming mind . They were a song of hilarity to Jinny Love , who began to skip . Periods of silence seemed hoarse , or the suffering from hoarseness , otherwise inexplicable , as though the world could stop . Cat was stalking something at the black edge of the ditch . The briars did n't trouble Cat at all , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boatlike belly . The track serpentined again , and walking ahead was Easter . Geneva and Etoile were playing at her side , edging each other out of her shadow , but when they saw who was coming up behind them , they turned and ran tearing back towards camp , running at angles , like pullets , leaving a cloud of dust as they passed by . " Would n't you know ! " said Jinny Love . Easter was going unconcernedly on , her dress stained green behind ; she ate something out of her hand as she went.  | " We 'll soon catch up  --  do n't hurry . " The reason orphans were the way they were lay first in nobody 's watching them , Nina thought , for she felt obscurely like a trespasser . They , they were not answerable . Even on being watched , Easter remainednot answerable to a soul on earth . Nobody cared ! And so , in this beatific state , something came out of her . " Where are you going ? " " Can we go with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with blackberries , replied , " It ai n't my road . " They walked along , one on each side of her . Though they automatically stuck their tongues out at her , they ran their arms around her waist . She toleratedthe closeness for a little while ; she smelled of orphan-starch , but she had a strange pure smell of sweat , like a sleeping baby , and in her temple , so close then to their eyes , the skin was transparent enough for a little vein to be seen pounding under it . She seemed very tender and very small in the waist to be trudging along so doggedly , when they had her like that . Vines , a magnificent and steamy green , covered more and more of the trees , played over them like fountains . There were stretches of water below them , blue-black , netted over with half-closed waterlilies . The horizontal limbs of cypresses grew a short , pale green scruff like bird feathers . They came to a tiny farm down here , the last one possible before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flower , a house whitewashed in front , a cleanswept yard with a little iron pump standing in the middle of it like a black rooster . These were white people  --  an old woman in a sunbonnet came out of the house with a galvanized bucket , and pumped it full in the dooryard . That was an excuse to see peoplego by . Easter , easing out of the others ' clasp , lifted her arm halfway and turning for an instant , gave two waves of the hand . But the old woman was prouder than she . Jinny Love said , " How would you all like to live there ? " Cat edged the woods onward , and at moments vanished into a tunnel in the briars . Emerging from other tunnels , he  --  or she  --  glanced up at them with a face more mask-like than ever . " There 's a short-cut to the lake . " Easter , breaking and darting ahead , suddenly went down on her knees and slid under a certain place in the barbed wire fence . Rising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she went . Nina untwined her arm from Jinny Love 's and went after her . " I might have known you 'd want us to go through a barbed wire fence . " Jinny Love sat down where she was , on the side of the ditch , just as she would take her seat on a needlepoint stool . She jumped up once , and sat back . " Fools , fools ! " she called . " Now I think you 've made me turn my ankle . Even if I wanted to track through the mud , I could n't ! " Nina and Easter , dipping under a second , unexpectedfence , went on , swaying and feeling their feet pulled down , reaching to the trees . Jinny Love was left behind in the heartless way people and incidents alike are thrown off in the course of a dream , like the gratuitous flowers scattered from a float rather in celebration . The swamp was now all-enveloping , dark and at the same time vivid , alarming  --  it was like beinginside the chest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Moon Lake , a different aspect altogether . Easter climbed the slight rise ahead and reached the pink , grassy rim and the innocent open . Here it was quiet , until , fatefully , there was one soft splash . " You see the snake drop off in the water ? " asked Easter . " Snake ? " " Out of that tree . "  | " You can have him . " " There he is : coming up ! " Easter pointed . " That 's probably a different one , " Nina objected in the voice of Jinny Love . Easter looked both ways , chose , and walked on the pink sandy rim with its purpled lip , her blue shadow lolling over it . She went around a bend , and straight to an old gray boat . Did she know it would be there ? It was in some reeds , looking mysterious to come upon and yet in place , as an old boat will . Easter stepped into it and hopped to the far seat that was over the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hooked up . She looked falling over backwards . One arm lifted , curved over her head , and hung till her finger touched the water . The shadows of the willow leaves moved gently on the sand , deep blue and narrow , long crescents . The water was quiet , the color of pewter , marked with purple stobs , although where the sun shone right on it the lake seemed to be in violent agitation , almost boiling . Surely a little chip would turn around and around in it . Nina dropped down on the flecked sandbar . She fluttered her eyelids , half closed them , and the world looked struck by moonlight . " Here I come , " came Jinny Love 's voice . It had n't been long . She came twitching over their tracks along the sandbar ; her long soft hair blowing up like a skirt in a play of the breeze in the open . " But I do n't choose to sit myself in a leaky boat , " she was calling ahead . " I choose the land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where Nina was writing her name . Nina moved her finger away , drawing a long arrow to a new place . The sand was coarse like beads and full of minute shells , some shaped exactly like bugles . " Want to hear about my ankle ? " Jinny Love asked . " It was n't as bad as I thought . I must say you picked a queer place , I saw an owl . It smells like the school basement to me  --  peepee and old erasers . " Then she stopped with her mouth a little open , and was quiet ,  | as though something had been turned off inside her . Her eyes were soft , her gaze stretched to Easter , to the boat , the lake  --  her long oval face went vacant . Easter was lying rocked in the gentle motion of the boat , her head turned on its cheek . She had not said hello to Jinny Love anew . Did she see the drop of water clinging to her lifted finger ? Did it make a rainbow ? Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt . Her own hand was writing in the sand . Nina , Nina , Nina . Writing , she could dream that her self might get away from her  --  that here in this farawayplace she could tell her self , by name , to go or to stay . Jinny Love had begun building a sand castle over her foot . In the sky clouds moved no more perceptiblythan grazing animals . Yet with a passing breeze , the boat gave a knock , lifted and fell . Easter sat up . " Why are n't we out in the boat ? " Nina , taking a strange and heady initiative , rose to her feet . " Out there ! " A picture in her mind , as if already furnished from an eventual and appreciative distance , showed the boat floating where she pointed , far out in Moon Lake with three girls sitting in the three spaces . " We 're coming , Easter ! " " Just as I make a castle . I 'm not coming , " said Jinny Love . " Anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be upset , ha ha . " " What do I care , I can swim ! " Nina cried at the water 's edge . " You can just swim from the first post to the second post . And that 's in front of camp , not here . " Firming her feet in the sucking , minnowy mud , Nina put her weight against the boat . Soon her legs were half hidden , the mud like some awful kiss pulled at her toes , and all over she tautened and felt the sweat start out of her body . Roots laced her feet , knotty and streaming . Under water , the boat was caught too , but Nina was determined to free it . She saw that there was muddy water in the boat too ,  |p131which  Easter 's legs , now bright pink , were straddling . Suddenly all seemed easy . " It 's coming looser ' At the last minute , Jinny Love , who had extracted her foot from the castle with success , hurried over and climbed to the middle seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the dip of the boat ; the energy seemed all to have gone out of her . Her lolling head looked pale and featureless as a pear beyond the laughing face of Jinny Love . She had not said whether she wanted to go or not yet surely she did ; she had been in the boat all along , she had discovered the boat . For a moment , with her powerful hands , Nina held the boat back . Again she thought of a pear  --  not the everyday gritty kind that hung on the tree in the backyard , but the fine kind sold on trains and at high prices , each pear with a paper cone wrapping it alone  --  beautiful , symmetrical , clean pears with thin skins , with snow-white flesh so juicy and tender that to eat one baptized the whole face , and so delicate that while you urgently ate the first half , the second half was already beginning to turn brown . To all fruits , and especially to those fine pears , something happened  --  the process was so swift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not the flowers that are fleeting , Nina thought , it 's the fruits  --  it 's the time when things are ready that they do n't stay . She even went through the rhyme , " Pear tree by the garden gate , How much longer must I wait ? "  --  thinking it was the pears that asked it , not the picker . Then she climbed in herself , and they were rocking out sideways on the water . " Now what ? " said Jinny Love . " This is all right for me , " said Nina . " Without oars ?  --  Ha ha . " ' Why did n't you tell me , then !  --  But I do n't care now. , , " You never are as smart as you think . "  | " Wait till you find out where we get to . " " I guess you know Easter ca n't swim . She wo n't even touch water with her foot . " " What do you think a boat 's for ? " But a soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark frown turned and looked down . " A chain ! An old mean chain ! " " That 's how smart you are . " Nina pulled the boat in again  --  of course nobody helped her !  --  burning her hands on the chain , and kneeling outward tried to free the other end . She could see now through the reeds that it was wound around and around an old stump , which had almost grown over it in places . The boat had been chained to the bank since maybe last summer . " No use hitting it , " said Jinny Love . A dragonfly flew about their heads . Easter only waited in her end of the boat , not seeming to care about the disappointment either . If this was their ship , she was their figurehead , turned on its back , sky-facing . She would n't be their passenger . " You thought we 'd all be out in the middle of Moon Lake by now , did n't you ? " Jinny Love said , from her lady 's seat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , Easter ! Easter ! I wish you still had your knife ! " "  --  But let 's do n't go back yet , " Jinny Love said on shore . " I do n't think they 've missed us . " She started a sand castle over her other foot . " You make me sick , " said Easter suddenly . " Nina , let 's pretend Easter 's not with us . " " But that 's what she was pretending . " Nina dug into the sand with a little stick , printing " Nina " and then " Easter . " Jinny Love seemed stunned , she let sand run out of both fists . " But how could you ever know what Easter was pretending ? " Easter 's hand came down and wiped her name clean ; she also wiped out " Nina . " She took the stickp133out of Nina 's hand and with a formal gesture , as if she would otherwise seem to reveal too much , wrote for herself . In clear , high-waisted letters the word " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . " Who 's that ? " Nina asked . Easter laid her thumb between her breasts , and walked about . " Why , I call that Esther . ' " " Call it Esther ' if you want to , I call it ' Easter . ' " " Well , sit down ... " And I named myself . " " How could you ? Who let you ? " " I let myself name myself . " " Easter , I believe you , " said Nina . " But I just want you to spell it right . Look  --  E-A-S  --  " " I should worry , I should cry . " Jinny Love leaned her chin on the roof of her castle to say , " I was named for my maternal grandmother , so my name 's Jinny Love . It could n't be anything else . Or anything better . You see ? Easter 's just not a real name . It does n't matter how she spells it , Nina , nobody ever had it . Not around here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " " Just see how it looks spelled right . " Nina lifted the stick from Easter 's fingers and began to print , but had to throw herself bodily over the name to keep Easter from it . " Spell it right and it 's real ! " she cried . " But right or wrong , it 's tacky . " said Jinny Love . " You ca n't get me mad over it . All I can concentrate on out here is missing the figs at home . " " ' Easter ' is real beautiful ! " Nina said distractedly . She suddenly threw the stick into the lake , before Easter could grab it , and it trotted up and down in a crucible of sun-filled water . " I thought it was the day you were found on a doorstep , " she said sullenly  --  evendistrustfully . Easter sat down at last and with slow , careful movements of her palms rubbed down the old bites on her legs . Her crest of hair dipped downward andp134she rocked a little , up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Easter never did intend to explain anything unless she had to  --  or to force your explanations . She just had hopes . She hoped never to be sorry . Or did she ? " I have n't got no father . I never had , he ran away . I 've got a mother . When I could walk , then my mother took me by the hand and turned me in , and I remember it . I 'm going to  --  be a singer . " It was Jinny Love , starting to clear her throat , who released Nina . It was Jinny Love , escaping , burrowingher finger into her castle , who was now kind , pretendingEaster had never spoken . Nina banged Jinny Love on the head with her fist . How good and hot her hair was ! Like hot glass . She broke the castle from her tender foot . She wondered if Jinny Love 's head would break . Not at all . You could n't learn anything through the head . " Ha , ha , ha ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hitting for a moment . Then they lay quiet , tilted together against the crumbled hill of sand , stretched out and looking at the sky where now a white tower of cloud was climbing . Someone moved ; Easter lifted to her lips a piece of cross-vine cut back in the days of her good knife . She brought up a kitchen match from her pocket , lighted up , and smoked . They sat up and gazed at her . " If you count much on being a singer , that 's not a very good way to start , " said Jinny Love . " Even boys , it stunts their growth . " Easter once more looked the same as asleep in the dancing shadows , except for what came out of her mouth , more mysterious , almost , than words . " Have some ? " she asked , and they accepted . But theirs went out . Jinny Love 's gaze was fastened on Easter , and she dreamed and dreamed of telling on her for smoking , while the sun , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she looked the most beautiful ofp135all : she felt temptation . But what she said was , " Even after all this is over , Easter , I 'll always remember you . " Off in the thick of the woods came a fairy sound , followed by a tremulous silence , a holding apart of the air . " What 's that ? " cried Easter sharply . Her throat quivered , the little vein in her temple jumped . " That 's Mister Loch Morrison . Did n't you know he had a horn ? " There was another fairy sound , and the pried-apart , gentle silence . The woods seemed to be moving after it , running  --  the world pellmell . Nina could see the boy in the distance , too , and the golden horn tilted up . A few minutes back her gaze had fled the present and this scene ; now she put the horn blower into his visionary place . " Do n't blow that ! " Jinny Love cried out this time , jumping to her feet and stopping up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You shut up ! We can hear !  --  Come on , " she added prosaically to the other two . " It 's time to go . I reckon they 've worried enough . " She smiled . " Here comes Cat . " Cat always caught something ; something was in his  --  or her  --  mouth , a couple of little feet or claws bouncing under the lifted whiskers . Cat did n't look especially triumphant ; just through with it . They marched on away from their little boat . One clear night the campers built a fire up above the spring , cooked supper on sticks around it , and after stunts , a recitation of " How They Brought the Good News from Ghent to Aix " by Gertrude Bowles , and the ghost story about the bone , they stood up on the ridge and poured a last song into the woods  --  " Little Sir Echo . " The fire was put out and there was no bright point to look into , no circle . The presence of night was be- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shine of outline , only of ornament rings , ear-rings ... . " March ! " cried Mrs. Gruenwald , and stamped down the trail for them to follow . They went single file on the still-warm pine needles , soundlessly now . Not far away there were crackings of twigs , small , regretted crashes ; Loch Morrison , supperless for all they knew , was wandering around by himself , sulking , alone . Nobody needed light . The night sky was pale as a green grape , transparent like grape flesh over each tree . Every girl saw moths the beautiful ones like ladies , with long legs that were wings  --  and the little ones , mere bits of bark . And once against the night , just before Little Sister Spights ' eyes , making her cry out , hung suspended a spider  --  a body no less mysteriousthan the grape of the air , different only a little . All around swam the fireflies . Clouds of them , trees of them , islands of them floating , a lower order of brightness  --  one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stars barely showed their places in the pale sky  --  small and far from this bright world . And the world would be bright as long as these girls held awake , and could keep their eyes from closing . And the moon itself shone  --  taken for granted . Moon Lake came in like a flood below the ridge ; they trailed downward . Out there Miss Moody would sometimes go in a boat ; sometimes she had a late date from town , " Rudy " Spights or " Rudy Loomis , and then they could be seen drifting there after the moon was up , far out on the smooth bright surface . ( " And she lets him hug her out there , " Jinny Love had instructed them . " Like this . " She had seized , of all people , Etoile , whose name rhymed with tinfoil . " Hands off , " said Etoile . ) Twice Nina had herself seen the silhouette of the canoe on the bright water , with the figures at each end , like a dark butterfly with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was only the niggers , fishing . But their boat must be full of silver fish ! Nina wondered if it was the slowness and near-fixity of boats out on thep137water that made them so magical . Their little boat in the reeds that day had not been far from this one 's wonder , after all . The turning of water and sky , of the moon , or the sun , always proceeded , and there was this magical hesitation in their midst , of a boat . And in the boat , it was not so much that they drifted , as that in the presence of a boat the world drifted , forgot . The dreamed-about changed places with the dreamer . Home from the wild moonlit woods , the file of little girls wormed into the tents , which were hot as cloth pockets . The candles were lighted by Miss Moody , dateless tonight , on whose shelf in the flare of nightly revelation stood her toothbrush in the glass , her handpaintedcelluloid powder box , her Honey and Almondcream , her rouge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line the bottle of Compound , containingtrue and false unicorn and the life root plant . Miss Moody , with a fervent frown which precluded interruption , sang in soft tremolo as she rubbed the lined-up children with " Sweet Dreams . " " Forgive me0 please forgive meI did n't mean to make You cry ! I love you and I need you- " They crooked and bent themselves and lifted nightgownsto her silently while she sang . Then when she faced them to her they could look into the deep tangledrats of her puffed hair and at her eyebrows which seemed fixed for ever in that elevated line of adult pleading . " Do anything but do n't say good-bye ! " And automatically they almost said , " Good-bye ! " Her hands rubbed and cuffed them while she sang , pullingto her girls all just alike , as if girlhood itself were an infinity , but a commodity . ( " I 'm ticklish , " Jinny Love informed her every night . ) Her look of pleading seemed infinitely perilous to them . Her voice had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even while she sang out of the nightgown coming down over her head . There were kisses , prayers . Easter , as though she could be cold tonight , got into bed with Geneva . Genevalike a little June bug hooked onto her back . The candles were blown . Miss Moody ostentatiously went right to sleep . finny Love cried into her pillow for her mother , or perhaps for the figs . Just outside their tent , Citronella burned in a saucer in the weeds  --  Citronella , like a girl 's name . Luminous of course but hidden from them , Moon Lake streamed out in the night . By moonlight sometimes it seemed to run like a river . Beyond the cry of the frogs there were the sounds of a boat moored somewhere , of its vague , clumsy reaching at the shore , those sounds that are recognized as being made by something sightless . When did boats have eyes  --  once ? Nothing watched that their little part of the lake stayed roped off and protected ; was it there now , the rope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rope was to mark how far the girls could swim . Beyond lay the deep part , some bottomless parts , said Moody . Here and there was the quicksand that stirred your footprint and kissed your heel . All snakes , harmless and harmful , were freely playing now ; they put a trailing , moony divisionbetween weed and weed  --  bright , turning , bright and turning . Nina still lay dreamily , or she had waked in the night . She heard Gertrude Bowles gasp in a dream , beginning to get her stomach ache , and Etoile begin , slowly , her snore . She thought : Now I can think , in between them . She could not even feel Miss Moody fretting . The orphan ! she thought exultantly . The other way to live . There were secret ways . She thought , Time 's really short , I 've been only thinking like the others.  |p139It  's only interesting , only worthy , to try for the fiercest secrets . To slip into them all  --  to change . To change for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  into a boy . To have been an orphan . Nina sat up on the cot and stared passionately beforeher at the night the pale dark roaring night with its secret step , the Indian night . She felt the forehead , the beaded stars , look in thoughtfully at her . The pondering night stood rude at the tent door , the opening fold would let it stoop in  --  it , him  --  he had risen up inside . Long-armed , or long-winged , he stood in the center there where the pole went up . Nina lay back , drawn quietly from him . But the night knew about Easter . All about her . Geneva had pushed her to the very edge of the cot . Easter 's hand hung down , opened outward . Come here , night , Eastermight say , tender to a giant , to such a dark thing . And the night , obedient and graceful , would kneel to her . Easter 's callused hand hung open there to the night that had got wholly into the tent . Nina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her hand too opened , of itself . She lay there a long time motionless , under the night 's gaze , its black cheek , looking immovably at her hand , the only part of her now which was not asleep . Its gesture was like Easter 's , but Easter 's hand slept and her own hand knew  --  shrank and knew , yet offered still . " Instead . . . me instead . . . " In the cup of her hand , in her filling skin , in the fingers ' bursting weight and stillness , Nina felt it : compassion and a kind of competing that were all one , a single ecstasy , a single longing . For the night was not impartial . No , the night loved some more than others , served some more than others . Nina 's hand lay open there for a long time , as if its fingers would be its eyes . Then it too slept . She dreamed her hand was helpless to the tearing teeth of wild beasts . At reveille she woke up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She hit it and bit it until like a cluster of bees it stung back and came to life.  | They had seen , without any idea of what he would do  --  and yet it was just like him  --  little old Exum toilingup the rough barky ladder and dreaming it up , clinging there monkeylike among the leaves , all eyes and wrinkled forehead . Exum was apart too , boy and nigger to boot ; he constantly moved along an even further fringe of the landscape than Loch , wearing the man 's stiff straw hat brilliant as a snowflake . They would see Exum in the hat bobbing along the rim of the swamp like a fisherman 's cork , elevated just a bit by the miasma and illusion of the landscape he moved in . It was Exum persistent as a little bug , inching along the foot of the swamp wall , carrying around a fishing cane and minnow can , fishing around the bend from their side of the lake , catching all kinds of things . Things , things . He claimed all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , clasped it with suspicious glee  --  would n't a soul dispute him that ? The Boy Scout asked him if he could catch an electric eel and Exum promised it readily  --  a gift ; the challenge was a siesta-long back-and-forth across the water . Now all rolling eyes , he hung on the ladder , too little to count as looking  --  too everything-he-was to count as anything . Beyond him on the diving-board , Easter was standing  --  highabove the others at their swimming lesson . She was motionless , barefooted , and tall with her outgrown , printed dress on her and the sky under her . She had not answered when they called things up to her . They splashed noisily under her callused , coralcoloredfoot that hung over . " How are you going to get down , Easter ! " shouted Gertrude Bowles . Miss Moody smiled understandingly up at Easter . How far , in the water , could Miss Parnell Moody be transformed from a schoolteacher ? They had won/dered . She wore a canary yellow bathing cap lumpy over her hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wore a brassiere and bloomers under her bathing suit because , said Jinny Love , that was exactly how good she was . She scarcely looked for trouble , immediatetrouble  --  though this was the last day at Moon Lake . Exum 's little wilted black fingers struck at his lips as if playing a tune on them . He put out a foolishly long arm . He held a green willow switch . Later they every one said they saw him but too late . He gave Easter 's heel the tenderest , obscurest little brush , with something of nigger persuasion about it . She dropped like one hit in the head by a stone from a sling . In their retrospect , her body , never turning , seemed to languish upright for a moment , then descend . It went to meet and was received by blue air . It dropped as if handed down all the way and was let into the brown water almost on Miss Moody ' s crown , and went out of sight at once . There was something so positive about its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it a moment to come up again ; it did n't come up . Then Exum let loose a girlish howl and clung to the ladder as though a fire had been lighted under it . Nobody called for Loch Morrison . On shore , he studiously hung his bugle on the tree . He was enormouslybarefooted . He took a frog dive and when he went through the air they noticed that the powderedondirt gave him lavender soles . Now he swam destructivelyinto the water , cut through the girls , and began to hunt Easter where all the fingers began to point . They cried while he hunted , their chins dropping into the brown buggy stuff and their mouths sometimesswallowing it . He did n't give a glance their way . He stayed under as though the lake came down a lid on him , at each dive . Sometimes , open-mouthed , he appeared with something awful in his hands , showingnot them , but the world , or himself  --  long ribbons of green and terrible stuff , shapeless black matter , nobody 's shoe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . Each dive was a call on Exum to scream again . " Shut up ! Get out of the way ! You stir up the lake ! " Loch Morrison yelled once  --  blaming them . They looked at one another and after one loud cry all stopped crying . Standing in the brown that cut them off where they waited , ankle-deep , waist-deep , kneedeep , chin-deep , they made a little V , with Miss Moody in front and partly obscuring their vision with her jerky butterfly cap . They felt his insult . They stood so still as to be almost carried away , in the pieturelesswarm body of lake around them , until they felt the weight of the currentless water pulling anyhow . Their shadows only , like the curled back edges of a split drum , showed where they each protruded out of Moon Lake . Up above , Exum howled , and further up , some fulsome , vague clouds with uneasy hearts blew peonylike . Exum howled up , down , and all around . He brought Elberta , mad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was dead to the world  --  asleep or reading  --  or she would be coming too , by now , caperingdown her favorite trail . It was Jinny Love , they realized , who had capered down , and now stood strangely signaling from shore . The painstaking work of Miss Moody , white bandages covered her arms and legs ; poison ivy had appeared that morning . Like Easter , Jinny Love had no intention of going in the lake . " Ahhhhh ! " everybody said , long and drawn out , just as he found her . Of course he found her , there was her arm sliding through his hand . They saw him snatch the hair of Easter 's head , the way a boy will snatch anything he wants , as if he wo n't have invisible opponents snatching first . Under the water he joined himself to her . He spouted , and with engine-like jerks brought her in.  |p143There  came Mrs. Gruenwald . With something like a skip , she came to a stop on the bank and waved her hands . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was red . They treasured that up . But her voice was pre-emptory . " This minute ! Out of the lake ! Out of the lake , outout ! Parnell ! Discipline ! March them out . " " One 's drowned ! " shrieked poor Miss Moody . Loch stood over Easter . He sat her up , folding , on the shore , wheeled her arm over , and by that dragged her clear of the water before he dropped her , a wrapped bundle in the glare . He shook himself in the sun like a dog , blew his nose , spat , and shook his ears , all in a kind of leisurely trance that kept Mrs. Gruenwald off  --  as though he had no notion that he was interrupting things at all . Exum could now be heard shrieking for Miss Marybelle Steptoe , the lady who had had the camp last year and was now marriedand living in the Delta . Miss Moody and all her girls now came out of the lake . Tardy , drooping , their hair heavy-wet and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shore . Loch returned to Easter , spread her out , and then they could all get at her , but they watched the water lake in her lap . The sun like a weight fell on them . Miss Moody wildly ran and caught up Easter 's ankle and pushed on her , like a lady with a wheelbarrow . The Boy Scout looped Easter 's arms like sashes on top of her and took up his end , the shoulders . They carried her , looking for shade . One arm fell , touching ground . Jinny Love , in the dazzling bandages , ran up and scooped Easter 's arm in both of hers . They proceeded , zigzag , Jinny Love turning her head toward the rest of them , running low , bearing the arm . They put her down in the only shade on earth , after all , the table under the tree . It was where they ate . The table was itself still mostly tree , as the ladderand diving board were half tree too ; a camp table had to be round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having been chopped down . They knew that splintery surface , and the ants that crawled on it . Mrs. Gruenwald , with her strong cheeks , blew on the table , but she might have put a cloth down . She stood between table and girls ; her tennis shoes , like lesser corsets , tied her feet solid there ; and they did not go any closer , but only to where they could see . " I got her , please ma'am . " In the water , the life saver 's face had held his whole impatience ; now it was washed pure , blank . He pulled Easter his way , away from Miss Moody  --  who , however , had got Easter 's sash ends wrung out  --  and then , with a turn , hid her from Mrs. Gruenwald . Holding her folded up to him , he got her clear , and the next moment , with a spread of his hand , had her lying there before him on the table top . They were silent . Easter lay in a mold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharp as a flatiron her hipbone pointed up . She was arm to arm and leg to leg in a long fold , wrong-colored and pressed together as unopen leaves are . Her breasts , too , faced together . Out of the water Easter 's hair was darkened , and lay over her face in long fern shapes . Miss Moody laid it back . " You can tell she 's not breathing , " said Jinny Love . Easter 's nostrils were pinched-looking like an old country woman 's . Her side fell slack as a dead rabbit'sin the woods , with the flowers of her orphan dress all running together in some antic of their own , some belated mix-up of the event . The Boy Scout had only let her go to leap onto the table with her . He stood over her , put his hands on her , and rolled her over ; they heard the distant-like knock of her forehead on the solid table , and the knocking of her hip and knee . Exum was heard being whipped in the willow clump ; then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son-a-bitch ! " they heard her yelling , and he howled through the woods . Astride Easter the Boy Scout lifted her up between his legs and dropped her . He did it again , and she fell on one arm . He nodded  --  not to them . There was a sigh , a Morgana sigh , not an orphans ' . The orphans did not press forward , or claim to own or protect Easter any more . They did nothing except mill a little , and yet their group was delicately changed . In Nina 's head , where the world was still partly leisurely , came a recollected scene : birds on a roof under a cherry tree ; they were drunk . The Boy Scout , nodding , took Easter 's hair and turned her head . He left her face looking at them . Her eyes were neither open nor altogether shut but as if her ears heard a great noise , back from the time she fell ; the whites showed under the lids pale and slick as watermelon seeds . Her lips were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen smeared with black mud . The Boy Scout reached in and gouged out her mouth with his hand , an unbelievable act . She did not alter . He lifted up , screwed his toes , and with a groan of his own fell upon her and drove up and down upon her , into her , gouging the heels of his hands into her ribs again and again . She did not alter except that she let a thin stream of water out of her mouth , a dark stain down the fixed cheek . The children drew together . Life-saving was much worse than they had dreamed . Worse still was the carelessnessof Easter 's body . Jinny Love volunteered once more . She would wave a towel over things to drive the mosquitoes , at least , away . She chose a white towel . Her unspotted arms lifted and criss-crossed . She faced them now ; her expression quietened and became ceremonious . Easter 's body lay up on the table to receive anything that was done to it . If he was brutal , her self @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . While the Boy Scout as if he rode a runaway horse clung momentlyto her and arched himself off her back , dug his knees and fists into her and was flung back careeningby his own tactics , she lay there . Let him try and try ! The next thing Nina knew was a scent of home , an adult 's thumb in her shoulder , and a cry , " Now what ? " Miss Lizzie Stark pushed in front of her , where her hips and black purse swung to a full stop , blotting out everything . She was Jinny Love 's mother and had arrived on her daily visit to see how the camp was running . They never heard the electric car coming , but usually they saw it , watched for it in the landscape , as out of place as a piano rocking over the holes and taking the bumps , making a high wall of dust . Nobody dared tell Miss Lizzie ; only Loch Morrison'sgrunts could be heard . " Some orphan get too much of it ? " Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing to her ? Stop that . " The Morgana girls all ran to her and clung to her skirt . " Get off me , " she said . " Now look here , everybody . I 've got a weak heart . You all know that .  --  Is that finny Love ? " " Leave me alone , Mama , " said Jinny Love , waving the towel . Miss Lizzie , whose hands were on Nina 's shoulders , shook Nina . " Jinny Love Stark , come here to me , Loch Morrison , get off that table and shame on you . " Miss Moody was the one brought to tears . She walked up to Miss Lizzie holding a towel in front of her breast and weeping . " He 's our life saver , Miss Lizzie . Remember ? Our Boy Scout . Oh , mercy , I 'm thankful you 've come , he 's been doing that a long time . Stand in the shade , Miss Lizzie . " " Boy Scout ? Why , he ought to be  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parnell Moody . "  | " Ca n't any of us help it , Miss Lizzie . Ca n't any of us . It 's what he came for . " She wept . " That 's Easter , " Geneva said . " That is . " " He ought to be put out of business , " Miss Lizzie Stark said . She stood in the center of them all , squeezingNina uncomfortably for Jinny Love , who flouted her up in front , and Nina could look up at her . The white rice powder which she used on the very front of her face twinkled on her faint mustache . She smelled of red pepper and lemon juice  --  she had been making them some mayonnaise . She was valiantlytrying to make up for all the Boy Scout was doing by what she was thinking of him : that he was odious . Miss Lizzie 's carelessly flung word to him on sight the first day  --  had been , " You little rascal , I bet you run down and pollute the spring , do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had said , showing the first evidence of his gloom . " Tears wo n't help , ParneIl , " Miss Lizzie said . " Though some do n't know what tears are . " She glanced at Mrs. Gruenwald , who glanced back from another level ; she had brought herself out a chair . " And our last afternoon . I 'd thought we 'd have a treat . " They looked around as here came Marvin , Miss Lizzie 's yard boy , holding two watermelons like a mother with twins . He came toward the table and just stood there . " Marvin . You can put those melons down , do n't you see the table 's got somebody on it ? " Miss Lizzie said . " Put ' em down and wait . " Her presence made this whole happening seem more in the nature of things . They were glad Miss Lizzie had come ! It was somehow for this that they had given those yells for Miss Lizzie as Camp Mother . Under her gaze the Boy Scout 's actions seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost to a nuisance  --  a mosquito , with a mosquito 's proboscis . " Get him off her , " Miss Lizzie repeated , in her rich and yet careless , almost humorousvoice , knowing it was no good . " Ah , get him off her . " She stood hugging the other little girls , several of them , warmly . Her gaze only hardened on Jinny Love ; they hugged her all the more . She loved them . It seemed the harder it was to get out here and the harder a time she found them having , the better she appreciated them . They rememberednow  --  while the Boy Scout still drove up and down on Easter 's muddy back  --  how they were alwaysgetting ready for Miss Lizzie ; the tents even now were straight and the ground picked up and raked for her , and the tea for supper was already made and sitting in a tub in the lake ; and sure enough , the niggers ' dog had barked at the car just as always , and now here she was . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped it . Even her opening protests seemed now like part of things  --  what she was supposed to say . Several of the little girls looked up at Miss Lizzie instead of at what was on the table . Her powdered lips flickered , her eyelids hooded her gaze , but she was there . On the table , the Boy Scout spat , and took a fresh appraisal of Easter . He reached for a hold on her hair and pulled her head back . No longer were her lips faintly parted  --  her mouth was open . It gaped . So did his . He dropped her , the head with its suddennessbowed again on its cheek , and he started again . " Easter 's dead ! Easter 's d  --  " cried Gertrude Bowles in a rowdy voice , and she was slapped rowdilyacross the mouth to cut off the word , by Miss Lizzie 's hand . Jinny Love , with a persistence they had not dreamed of , deployed the towel . Could it be owing to Jinny Love 's always being on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all this to a stop ? Nina thought , It 's I that 's thinking . Easter 's not thinkingat all . And while not thinking , she is not dead , but unconscious , which is even harder to be . Easterp149had come among them and had held herself untouchableand intact . Of course , for one little touch could smirch her , make her fall so far , so deep .  --  Except that by that time they were all saying the nigger deliberately poked her off in the water , meant her to drown . " Do n't touch her , " they said tenderly to one another . " Give up ! Give up ! Give up ! " screamed Miss Moody  --  she who had rubbed them all the same , as if she rubbed chickens for the frying pan . Miss Lizzie without hesitation slapped her too . " Do n't touch her . " For they were crowding closer to the table all the time . " If Easter 's dead , I get her coat for winter , all right , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she then ? " ' You shut up . " The Boy Scout looked around and panted at Geneva . " You can ast me when I ast you to ast me . " The niggers dog was barking again . had been barking . " Now who ? " " A big boy . It 's old Ran MacLain and he 's coming . " " He would . " He came right up , wearing a cap . " Get away from me , Ran MacLain , " Miss Lizzie called toward him . " You and dogs and guns , keep away . We 've already got all we can put up with out here . " She put her foot down on his asking any questions , getting up on the table , or leaving , now that he 'd come . Under his cap bill , Ran MacLain set his gaze  --  he was twenty-thee , his seasoned gaze  --  on Loch and Easter on the table . He could not be prevented from considering them all . He moved under the tree . He held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run loose , and almost imperceptibly , he chewed gum . Only Miss Moody did not move away from him . And pressing closer to the table , Nina almost walked into Easter 's arm flung out over the edge . The arm was turned at the elbow so that the hand opened upward . It held there the same as it had held when the night came in and stood in the tent , when it had come to Easter and not to Nina . It was the one hand , and it seemed the one moment . " Do n't touch her . " Nina fainted . She woke up to the cut-onion odor of Elberta 's under-arm . She was up on the table with Easter , foot to head . There was so much she loved at home , but there was only time to remember the front yard . The silver , sweet-smelling paths strewed themselvesbehind the lawn mower , the four-o'clocks blazed . Then Elberta raised her up , she got down from the table , and was back with the others . " Keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep away . Leave me alone , " Loch Morrison was saying with short breaths . " I dove for her , did n't I ? " They hated him , Nina most of all . Almost , they hated Easter . They looked at Easter 's mouth and at the eyes where they were contemplating without sense the back side of the light . Though she had bullied and repulsed them earlier , they began to speculate in another kind of allurement : was there danger that Easter , turned in on herself , might call out to them after all , from the other , worse , side of it ? Her secret voice , if soundless then possibly visible , might work out of her terrible mouth like a vine , preening and sprung with flowers . Or a snake would come out . The Boy Scout crushed in her body and blood came out of her mouth . For them all , it was like beingspoken to . " Nina , you ! Come stand right here in my skirt , " Miss Lizzie called . Nina went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the neck of her dress , like a big cloven white hide.  |p151finny  Love was catching her mother 's eye . Of course she had stolen brief rests , but now her white arms lifted the white towel and whipped it bravely . She looked at them until she caught their eye  --  as if in the end the party was for her . Marvin had gone back to the car and brought two more melons , which he stood holding . " Marvin . We are n't ready for our watermelon . I told you . " " Oh , Ran . How could you ? Oh , Ran . " That was Miss Moody in still a third manifestation . By now the Boy Scout seemed for ever part of Easterand she part of him , he in motion on the up-anddownand she stretched across . He was dripping , while her skirt dried on the table ; so in a manner they had changed places too . Was time moving ? Endlessly , Ran MacLain 's dogs frisked and played , with the niggers ' dog between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the curve of her brow , the soft upper lip and the milky eyes  --  partook of the swoon of her fall  --  the almost forgotten fall that bathed her so purely in blue for that long moment . The face was set now , and ugly with that rainy color of seedling petunias , the kind nobody wants . Her mouth surely by now had been open long enough , as long as any gape , bite , cry , hunger , satisfaction lasts , any one person 's grief , or even protest . Not all the children watched , and their heads all were beginning to hang , to nod . Everybody had forgotten about crying . Nina had spotted three little shells in the sand she wanted to pick up when she could . And suddenly this seemed to her one of those moments out of the future , just as she had found one small brief one out of the past ; this was far , far ahead of her  --  picking up the shells , one , another , another , without time moving any more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dying and beyondbeing remembered about " I 'm so tired ! " Gertrude Bowles said . " And hot . Ai n't you tired of Easter , laying up there on that table ? " " My arms are about to break , you all , " and Jinny Love stood and hugged them to her . " I 'm so tired of Easter , " Gertrude said . " Wish she 'd go ahead and die and get it over with , " said Little Sister Spights , who had been thumbsuckingall afternoon without a reprimand . " I give up , " said Jinny Love . Miss Lizzie beckoned , and she came . " I and Nina and Easter all went out in the woods , and I was the only one that came back with poison ivy , " she said , kissing her mother . Miss Lizzie sank her fingers critically into the arms of the girls at her skirt . They all rose on tiptoe . Was Easter dead then ? Looking out for an instant from precarious holds , they took in sharply for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and set on the face , one hand displayed , one jealously clawed under the waist , as if a secret handful had been groveled for , the spread and spotted legs . It was a betrayed figure , the betrayalwas over , it was a memory . And then as the blows , automatic now , swung down again , the figure itself gasped . " Get back . Get back . " Loch Morrison spoke betweencruel , gritted teeth to them , and crouched over . And when they got back , her toes webbed outward . Her belly arched and drew up from the board under her . She fell , but she kicked the Boy Scout . Ridiculously , he tumbled backwards off the table . He fell almost into Miss Lizzie 's skirt ; she halved herself on the instant , and sat on the ground with her lap spread out before her like some magnificent hat that has just got crushed . Ran MacLain hurried politely over to pick her up , but she fought him off . " Why do n't you go home  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Easter got to her knees , sat up ,  |p153and  drew her legs up to her . She rested her head on her knees and looked out at them , while she slowly pulled her ruined dress downward . The sun was setting . They felt it directly behind them , the warmth flat as a hand . Easter leaned slightly over the table 's edge , as if to gaze down at what might move , and blew her nose ; she accomplishedthat with the aid of her finger , like people from away in the country . Then she sat looking out again ; in another moment her legs dropped and hung down . The girls looked back at her , through the yellow and violet streams of dust just now reaching them from Ran MacLain 's flivver  --  the air coarse as sacking let down from the tree branches . Easter lifted one arm and shaded her eyes , but the arm fell in her lap like a clod . There was a sighing sound from them . For the firsttimethey noticed there was an old basket on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tin cups and plates . " Carry me . " Easter 's words had no inflection . Again , " Carry me . " She held out her arms to them , stupidly . Then Ran MacLain whistled to his dogs . The girls ran forward all together . Mrs. Gruenwald'sfists rose in the air as if she lifted  --  no , rather had lowered  --  a curtain and she began with a bleatingsound , " Pa-a-ack  --  " "  --  up your troubles in your old kit bag And smile , smile , smile ! " The Negroes were making a glorious commotion , all of them came up now , and then Exum escaped them all and ran waving away to the woods , dainty as a loosened rabbit . " Who was he , that big boy ? " Etoile was asking finny Love . " Ran MacLain , slow-poke . " " What did he want ? " " He 's just waiting on the camp . They 're coming out tomorrow , hunting . I heard all he said to Miss Moody . " " Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and his twin brother too . " Nina , running up in the front line with the others , sighed the sigh she gave when she turned in her examination papers at school . Then with each step she felt a defiance of her own . She screamed , " Easter ! " In that passionate instant , when they reached Easterand took her up , many feelings returned to Nina , some joining and some conflicting . At least what had happened to Easter was out in the world , like the table itself . There it remained  --  mystery , if only for being hard and cruel and , by something Nina felt inside her body , murderous . Now they had Easter and carried her up to the tent , Mrs. Gruenwald still capering backwards and leading on , "  --  in your old kit bag ! Smile , girls-instead-of-boys , that 's the style ! " Miss Lizzie towered along darkly , groaning . She grabbed hold of Little Sister Spights , and said , " Can you brush me off ! " She would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a place to sit down and a glass of cold water . She did not speak to Marvinyet ; he was shoving the watermelons up onto the table . Their minds could hardly capture it again , the way Easter was standing free in space , then handled and turned over by the blue air itself . Some of them looked back and saw the lake , rimmed around with its wall-within-walls of woods , into which the dark had already come . There were the water wings of Little Sister Spights , floating yet , white as a bird . " I know another Moon Lake , " one girl had said yesterday . " Oh , my child , Moon Lakes are all over the world , " Mrs. Gruenwald had interrupted . " I know of one in Austria . . . " And into each fell a girl , they dared , now , to think.  |p155The  lake grew darker , then gleamed , like the water of a rimmed well . Easter was put to bed , they sat quietly on the ground outside the tent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sky 's rising clouds lighted all over , like one spread-out blooming mimosa tree that could be seen from where the trunk itself should rise . Nina and Jinny Love , wandering down the lower path with arms entwined , saw the Boy Scout 's tent . It was after the watermelon feast , and Miss Lizzie 's departure . Miss Moody , in voile and tennis shoes , had a date with old " Rudy " Loomis , and Mrs. Gruenwaldwas trying to hold the girls with a sing before bedtime . Easter slept ; Twosie watched her . Nina and Jinny Love could hear the floating songs , farewell-like , the cheers and yells between . An owl hooted in a tree , closer by . The wind stirred . On the other side of the tent wall the slats of the Boy Scout 's legs shuttered open and shut like a fan when he moved back and forth . He had a lantern in there , or perhaps only a candle . He finished off his own shadow by opening the flap of his tent . Jinny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campers . The Boy Scout , little old Loch Morrison , was undressingin his tent for the whole world to see . He took his time wrenching off each garment ; then he threw it to the floor as hard as he would throw a ball ; yet that seemed , in him , meditative . His candle  --  for that was all it was  --  jumping a littlenow , he stood there studying and touching his case of sunburn in a Kress mirror like theirs . He was naked and there was his little tickling thing hung on him like the last drop on the pitcher 's lip . He ceased or exhausted study and came to the tent opening again and stood leaning on one raised arm , with his weight on one foot just looking out into the night , which was clamorous . It seemed to them he had little to do ! Had n't he surely , just before they caught him , been pounding his chest with his fists ? Bragging on himself ? It seemed to them they could still hear in the beating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have struck off . His silly , brief , overriding little show they could well imagine there in his tent of separation in the middle of the woods , in the night . Minnowy thing that matched his candle flame , naked as he was with that , he thought he shone forth too . Did n't he ? Nevertheless , standing there with the tent slanting over him and his arm knobby as it reached up and his head bent a little , he looked rather at loose ends . " We can call like an owl , " Nina suggested . But Jinny Love thought in terms of the future . " I 'll tell on him , in Morgana tomorrow . He 's the most conceitedBoy Scout in the whole troop ; and 's bowlegged . " You and I will always be old maids , " she added . Then they went up and joined the singing.  |p157Father  , I wish I could talk to you , wherever you are right now . Mother said , Where have you been , son ?  --  Nowhere , Mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , son . You could come back to MacLain and live with me now .  --  I ca n't do that , Mother . You know I have to stay in Morgana . When I slammed the door of the bank I rolled down my sleeves and stood for some time looking out at the cotton field behind Mr. Wiley Bowles ' across the street , until it nearly put me to sleep and then woke me up like a light turned on in my face . Woodrow Spights had been gone a few minutes or so . I got in my car and drove up the street , turned around at the foot of Jinny 's driveway ( yonder went Woody ) and drove down again . I turned around in our old driveway , where Miss Francine had the sprinkler running , and made the same trip . The thing everybody does every day , except not by themselves . There was Maideen Sumrall on the drugstore step waving a little green handkerchief . When I did n't remember to stop , I saw the handkerchief pulled down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'd caught her ride with Red Ferguson . So I went to my room . Bella , Miss Francine Murphy 's little dog , panted all the time  --  she was sick . I always went out in the backyard and spoke to her . Poor Bella , how do you do , lady ? Is it hot , do they leave you alone ? Mother said on the phone , Have you been out somewhere , son ?  --  Just to get a little air .  --  I can tell you 're all peaked . And you keep things from me , I do n't understand . You 're as bad as Eugene Hudson . Now I have two sons keeping things from me.  --  I have n't been anywhere , where would I go ?  --  If you came back with me , to MacLain Courthouse , everything would be all right . I know you wo n't eat at Miss Francine ' s table , not her biscuit .  --  It 's as good as Jinny 's , Mother . But Eugene 's safe in California , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Miss Perdita Mayo came up to my window and hollered , " Randall , when are you going back to your precious wife ? You forgive her , now you hear ? That 's no way to do , bear grudges . Your mother never bore your father a single grudge in her life , and he made her life right hard . I tell you , how do you suppose he made her life ? She do n't bear him a grudge . We 're all human on earth . Where 's little old Woodrow this morning , late to work or you done something to him ? I still think of him a boy in knee britches and Buster Brown bob , riding that pony , that extravagant pony , cost a hundred dollars . Woodrow : a little common but so smart . Felix Spights never overcharged a customer , and Miss Billy Texas amounted to a good deal before she got like she is now ; and Missie could always play the piano better than average ; Little Sister too young to tell yet . Ah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world in my rocking chair , and I tell you we all get surprises now and then . But you march on back to your wife , Ran MacLain . You hear ? It 's a thing of the flesh not the spirit , it 'll pass . Jinny 'll get over thisp159in three four months . You hear me ? And you go backnice . " " Still hotter today , is n't it ? " I picked up Maideen Sumrall and we rode up and down the street . She was from the Sissum community . She was eighteen years old . " Look ! Citified , " she said , and pushed both hands at me ; she had new white cotton gloves on . Maideen would ride there by me and talk about things I did n't mind hearing about the Seed and Feed where she clerked and kept the books , Old Man Moody that she worked for , the way working in Morgana seemed after the country and junior college . Her first job : her mother still did n't like the idea . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me sometimes like this , instead of with Red Ferguson in the Coca-Cola truck . So she told me now . " And I did n't think you were going to see me at first , Ran . I saved my gloves to wear riding home in a car . " I told her my eyes had gone bad . She said she was sorry . She was country-prim and liked to have something to put in words that she could be sorry about . I drove , idling along , up and down a few times more . Mr. Steptoe was dragging the mail sack into the postoffice  --  he and Maideen waved . In the Presbyterianchurch Missie Spights was playing " Will There Be Any Stars in My Crown ? " , and Maideen listened . And on the street the same ones stood in doorways or rode in their cars , and waved at my car . Maideen ' s little blue handkerchief was busy waving back . She waved at them as she did at me . " I would n't be surprised if it was n't hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ count money all day , Ran "  --  to say something to me . She knew what anybody in Morgana told her ; and for four or five afternoons after the first one I picked her up and took her up and down the street a few turns , bought her a coke at Johnny Loomis 's , andp160drove her home out by Old Forks and let her out , and she never said a word except a kind one , like about counting money . She was kind ; her company was the next thing to being alone . I drove her home and then drove back to Morgana to the room I had at Miss Francine Murphy 's . Next time , there at the end of the pavement , I turned up the cut to the Starks ' . I could n't stand it any longer . Maideen did n't say a word till we reached the head of the drive and stopped . " Ran ? " she said . She was n't asking anything . She meant just to remind me I had company , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went around and opened her door . " You want to take me in yonder ? " she said . " Please , I 'd just as soon you would n't . " Her head hung . I saw the extra-white part in her hair . I said , " Sure . Let 's go in and see Jinny . Why not ? ' I could n't stand it any longer , that was why . " I 'm going and taking you . " It was n't as if Mr. Drewsie Carmichael did n't say to me every afternoon , " Come on home with me , boy "  --  argue , while he banged that big Panama  --  like yours , Father  --  down on his head , " no sense in your not sleeping cool , with one of our fans turned on you . Mamie 's mad at you for roasting in that room across the street from us  --  you could move in five minutes . Well , Ran , look : Mamie has something to say to you : I do n't . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left . He 'd stand and hold his cane  --  the one Woody Spights and I had bought him togetherwhen he was elected Mayor  --  up by his head , to threaten me with comfort , till I answered him , " No thanks , sir . " Maideen was at my side . We walked across the Starks ' baked yard to the front porch , passing underthe heavy heads of those crape myrtles , the toop161bright blooms that hang down like fruits that might drop . My wife 's mother  --  Miss Lizzie Morgan , Father  --  put her face to her bedroom window first thing . She 'd know it first if I came back , all right . Parting her curtains with a steel crochet hook , she looked down at Randall MacLain coming to her door , and bringing who-on-earth with him . " What are you doing here , Ran MacLain ? " When I did n't look up , she rapped on the window sill with her hook . " I 've never been inside the Stark home , " Maideen said , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lilies must have been in bloom somewhere near , and I took a full breath of their ether smell : consciousness could go or not . I pulled open the screen door . From above , inside somewhere , Miss Lizzie was calling , " Jinny Love ! " like Jinny had a date . Jinny  --  not out playing croquet stood with her legs apart , cutting off locks of her hair at the hall mirror . The locks fell at her feet . She had on straw sandals , the kind that would have to be ordered , boy 's shorts . She looked up at me , short range , and said " Just in time , to tell me when to stop . " She 'd cut bangs . Her smile reminded me of the way a child will open its mouth all right , but not let out the cry till it sees the right person . And turning to the mirror she cut again . " Obey that impulse  --  " She had seen Maideen then , and she went right on cutting her hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off your gloves . " That 's right : she would know , with her quickness like foreknowledge , first that I would come back when the summer got too much for me , and second that I 'd just as soon bring a stranger if I could find one , somebody who did n't know any better , to , come in the house with me when I came . Father , I wished I could go back . I looked at Jinny 's head with the ragged points all over it , and there was Miss Lizzie coming down ; shep162had just stopped to change her shoes , of course . For the kind that came down stairs like a march . As we all fell in together , we were leaving where we met too , starting down the hall with nobody pairing , and over each other 's names or whatever we said , Jinny 's voice hollered at Tellie for cokes . She counted us with her finger . That lightness came right back . Just to step on the matting , that billows a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on it , I could have floated , risen and floated . In rockers  --  we sat on the back porch  --  we were all not rocking . The chairs , white wicker , had a new coat of paint their thousandth-and-first , but one new coat since I left Jinny . The outside  --  a sheet of white light was in my eyes . The ferns close around us were hushing on their stands , they had just been watered . I could listen to women and hear pieces of the story , of what happened to us , of course  --  but I listened to the ferns . No matter , it was being told . Not in Miss Lizzie 's voice , which would n't think of it , certainly not in Jinny 's , but in the clear voice of Maideen where it had never existed  --  all the worse for the voice not even questioning what it said just repeating , just rushing , old  --  the town words . Telling what she was told she saw , repeating what she listened to  --  young girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taught , some each day , to sing a song people have made .... Even Miss Lizzie put her head on one side , to let Maideen be . He walked out on her and took his clothes down to the other end of the street . Now everybody 's waiting to see how soon he 'll go back . They say Jinny MacLain invites Woody out there to eat , a year younger than she is , remember when they were born . Invites , under her mama 's nose . Sure , it 's WoodrowSpights she invites . Who else in Morgana would there be for Jinny Stark after Ran , with even Eugene MacLain gone ? She 's kin to the Nesbitts . They do n't say when it started , can anybody tell ? At the Circle ,  |p163at  Miss Francine 's , at Sunday School , they say , they say she will marry Woodrow : Woodrow 'd jump at it but Ran will kill somebody first . And there 's Ran 's papa and the way he was and is , remember , remember ? And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Snowdie , it 's her burden . He used to be sweet but too much devil in him from Time was , that 's Ran . He 'll do something bad . He wo n't divorce Jinny but he 'll do something bad . Maybe kill them all . They say Jinny 's not scared of that . Maybe she drinks and hides the bottle , you know her father 's side . And just as prissy as ever on the street . And oh , do n't you know , they run into each other every day of the world , all three . Sure , how could they help it if they wanted to help it , how could you get away from it , right in Morgana ? You ca n't get away in Morgana . Away from anything at all , you know that . Father ! You did n't listen . And Tellie was mad at all of us . She still held the tray , she held it about an inch and a half too high . When Maideen took her coke in her white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look too tacky and mussed when I work in the store all day to be coming in anybody'sstrange house . " " You 're by far the freshest one here , my dear . " Who else had Maideen ever known to talk about but herself ? But she looked like Jinny . She was a child 's copy of finny . Jinny 's first steady look at me , coming just then , made that plain all at once . ( Oh , her look always made contamination plain . Or plainer . ) That resemblance I knew post-mortem , so to speak  --  and it made me right pleased with myelf . I do n't mean there was any mockery in Maideen 's little face  --  nobutthere was something of Maideen in Jinny 's , that went back early  --  to whatever I knew my finny would never be now . The slow breeze from that ceiling fan its old white blades frosted like a cake , with the flies ridingon it lifted the girls ' hair like one passing hand ,  | Maideen 's brown hair shoulder-long and Jinny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself , as she liked doing . Maideen was even more polite than she 'd ever been to me , and making intervals in the quiet , like the ferns dripping , she talked about herself and the Seed and Feed ; but she glowed with something she did n't know about , yet , there in the room with Jinny . And Jinny sat not rocking , yet , with her clever , not-listening smile . I looked from Jinny to Maideen and back to Jinny , and almost listened for some compliment  --  a complimentfrom somewhere  --  Fatherl  --  for my good eyes , my vision . It took me , after all , to bring it out . There was nothing but time between them . There were those annoying sounds keeping on out there  --  people and croquet . We finished the cokes . Miss Lizzie just sat there  --  hot . She still held the crochet hook , straight up like a ruler , and nobody was rapped , done to death . Jinny was on her feet , inviting us out to play croquet . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the shade of the far backyard  --  Woody , Johnnie and Etta Loomis , Nina Carmichael and Jinny 's cousin Junior Nesbitt , and the fourteen-year-old child that they let play  --  with Woody Spights knocking his ball through a wicket . He was too young for me  --  I 'd never really looked at him before this year ; he was coming up in the world . I looked down through the yard and the usual crowd seemed to have dwindled a little , I could not think who was out . Jinny went down there . It was myself . Mother said , Son , you 're walking around in a dream . Miss Perdita came and said , " I hear you went back yesterday and would n't open your mouth , left again . Might as well not go at all . But no raring up now and doing anything we 'll all be sorry to hear about . I know you wo n't . I knew your father , wasp165crazy about your father , glad to see him come every time , sorry to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world , most happily mated people in the world , long as he was home . Tell your mother I said so , next time you see her . And you march back to that precious wife . March back and have you some chirren . My Circle declares Jinny 's going to divorce you , marry Woodrow . I said , Why ? Thing of the flesh , I told my Circle , wo n't last . Sister said you 'd kill him , and I said Sister , who are you talking about ? If it 's Ran MacLain that I knew in his buggy , I said , he 's not at all likely to take on to that extent . And little Jinny . Who 's going to tell Lizzie to spank her , though ? I could n't help but laugh at Jinny : she says , It 's my own business ! We was in Hardware , old Holifield just scowling his head off . I says , How did it happen , Jinny , tell old Miss Perdita , you monkey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like me . Do like me , she says , and just go on like nothing 's happened . I declare , and she says I have to write my checks on the Morgana bank , and Woody Spights works in it , there 's just him and Ran , so I go up to Woody and cash them . And I says , Child  --  how could you all get away from each other if you tried ? You could n't . It 's a pity you had to run to a Spights , though . Oh , if there 'd just been some Carmichael boys , I often say ! No matter who you are , though , it 's an endless circle . That 's what a thing of the flesh is , endless circle . And you wo n't get away from that in Morgana . Even our little town . " All right , I said to Old Man Moody while ago , look . Jinny was unfaithful to Ran  --  that 's the up-anddownof it . There you have what it 's all about . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told Dave Moody . Like LizzieStark does , she 's brave . Though she 's seven miles south of here , Snowdie MacLain 's another brave one . Poor Billy Texas Spights is beyond knowing . You 're just a seed and feed man and the marshal here , you do n't form opinions enough to suit me. " finny was never scared of the Devil himself as a growing girl , so she certainly should n't be now , she 's twenty-five . She 's Lizzie 's own . And Woodrow Spights wo n't ever quit at the bank , will he ? It 's so much cleaner than the store , and he 'll get the store too . So it 's up to you , Ran , looks like . " And I 'd go back to my lawful spouse ! " Miss Perdita puts both hands on the bars of my cage and raises her voice . " You or I or the Man in the Moon got no business sleeping in that little hot upstairs room with a western exposure at Miss Francine Murphy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! And even if it is the house you grew up in , it 's a different room . And listen here to me . Do n't you ruin a country girl in the bargain . Make what you will of that . " She backs away leaving her hands out , pulling-like at the air , like I 'm floating on my ear suspended , hypnotized , and she can leave . But she just goes as far as the next window  --  Woody Spights ' . I went back to the room I had at Miss Francine Murphy 's . Father , it used to be the trunk room . It had Mother 's pieced quilts and her wedding dress and all the terrible accumulation of a long time you would n't have known about . After work I would cut the grass or something in Miss Francine 's backyard so it would be cooler for Bella . It kept the fleas away from her to some extent . It did n't do much good . The heat held on . I tried going to Jinny 's a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still playing croquet with a little girl , and the women had taken off to themselves , on the porch . I tried without Maideen . It was the long Mississippi evening , the waiting till it was cool enough to eat . The voice of Miss Lizzie carried . Like the hum of the gin , it was there , but the evening was still quiet , still very hot and quiet . Somebody called to me , " You 're dead on Woody . " It was just a little Williams girl in pigtails . I may have answered with a joke . I felt light/headed , not serious at all , really doing it for a child when I lifted my mallet the one with the red band that had always been mine . But I brought Woody Spights down with it . He toppled and shook the ground . I felt the air rush up . Then I beat on him . I went over his whole length , and cracked his head apart with that soft girl 's hair and all the ideas , beat on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to the numerous little bones in the foot , was cracked in two . I did n't have done with Woody Spights till then . And I proved the male human body  --  it has a too positive , too special shape , you know , not to be hurt  --  it could be finished up pretty fast . It just takes one good loud blow after another  --  Jinny should be taught that . I looked at Woodrow down there . And his blue eyes were just as unharmed . Just as unharmed as bubbles a child blows , the most impervious things  --  you 've seen grass blades go through bubbles and they still reflect the world , give it back unbroken . Woodrow Spights I declare was dead . " Now you watch , " he said . He spoke with no sign of pain . Just that edge of competition was in his voice . He was ever the most ambitious fool . To me ambition 's always been a mystery , but now it was his try to deceive us  --  me and him both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the broken jawbone of Woody Spights , but it could . I heard him say , " Now you watch . " He was dead on the ruined grass . But he had risen up . Just to call attention to it , he gave the fat little Williams girl a spank . I could see the spank , but I could n't hear it  --  the most familiar sound in the world . And I should have called out then  --  All is disgrace ! Human beings ' cries could swell if locusts ' could , in the last of evening like this , and cross the grass in a backyard , if only they enough of them cried . At our feet the shadows faded out light into no shadows left and the locusts sang in long waves , O-E , O-E ,  |p168and  the gin ran on . Our grass in August is like the floor of the sea , and we walk on it slowly playing , and the sky turns green before dark , Father , as you know . The sweat ran over my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like an upside-down tree . Then , " You all come in ! " They were calling from the porch  --  the well-known lamps suddenly all went on . They called us in their calling women 's voices , of disguise , all but Jinny . " Fools , you 're playing in the dark ! " she said . " Supper 's ready , if anybody cares . " The bright porch across the dark was like a boat on the river to me ; an excursion boat I was n't going on . I was going to Miss Francine Murphy 's , as everybodyknew . Each evening to avoid Miss Francine and the three school teachers , I ran through the porch and hall both like a man through a burning building . In the backyard , with fig trees black , otherwise moonlit , Bella opened her eyes and looked at me . Her eyes both showed the moon . If she drank water , she vomited it up  --  yet she went with effort to her pan and drank again , for me . I held her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tumor , and stayed with her most of the night . Mother said , Son , I was glad to see you but I noticed that old pistol of your father 's in your nice coat pocket , what do you want with that ? Your father never cared for it , went off and left it . Not any robberscoming to the Morgana bank that I know of . Son , if you 'd just saved your money you could take a little trip to the coast . I 'd go with you . They alwayshave a breeze at Gulf port , nearly always . Where the driveway ends at Jinny 's , there are Spanish daggers and the bare front yard with the forked tree with the seat around it like some old playground of a consolidated school , with the school back out of sight . Just the sharp , overgrown Spanish daggers , and the spiderwebs draped over them like clothes-rags . You can go under trees to the house byp169going all around the yard and opening the old gate by the summerhouse . Somewhere back in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dancing girl with her finger to her chin , all pockmarked , with some initials on her legs . Maideen liked the statue but she said , " Are you taking me back in ? I thought maybe now you were n't going to . " I saw my hand on the gate and said , " Now you wait . I 've lost a button . " I held out my sleeve to Maideen . All at once I felt so unlike myself I was ready to shed tears . " A button ? Why , I 'll sew you one on , if you come on and take me home , " Maideen said . That 's what I wanted her to say , but she touched my sleeve . A chameleon ran up a leaf , and held there panting . " Then Mama can meet you . She 'd be glad to have you stay to supper . " I unlatched the little old gate . I caught a whiff of the sour pears on the ground , the smell of August . I 'd never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , or would see her mama , of course ; but also I kept forgetting about the old ways , the eternal politenessof the people you hope not to know . " Oh , Jinny can sew it on now , " I said . " Oh , I can ? " Jinny said . She 'd of course been listeningall the time from the summerhouse . She came out , alone , with the old broken wicker basket full of speckled pears . She did n't say go back and shut the gate . I carried the rolling basket for her and we went ahead of Maideen but I knew she was coming behind ; she would n't know very well how not to . There in the flower beds walked the same robins . The sprinkler dripped now . Once again we went into the house by the back door . Our hands touched . We had stepped on Tellie 's patch of mint . The yellowcat was waiting to go in with us , the door handle was as hot as the hand , and on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went in together , the Mason jars with the busy cuttings in water  --  " Watch out for Mama 's  --  ! " A thousand times we 'd gone in like that . As a thousand bees had droned and burrowedin the pears that lay on the ground . Miss Lizzie shrank with a cry and started abruptly up the back stairs  --  bosom lifted  --  her shadow trotted up the boarding beside her like a bear with a nose . But she could n't get to the top ; she turned . She came down , carefully , and held up a finger at me . She needed to be careful . That stairs was the one Mr. Comus Stark fell down and broke his neck on one night , going up the back way drunk . Did I call it to attention ?  --  Jinny got away . " Randall . I ca n't help but tell you about a hand I held yesterday . My partner was Mamie Carmichael and you know she always plays her own hand with no more regard for her partner than you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Loomis doubled . I held : a singleton spade , five clubs to the king-queen , five hearts to the king , and two little diamonds . I said two clubs . Parnell Moody said two diamonds , Mamie two spades , all passed . And when I laid down my hand Mamie said , Oh , partner ! Why did n't you bid your hearts ! I said , Hardly . At the level of three with the opponents doubling for a takeout . It developed of course she was two-suited  --  six spades to the ace-jack and four hearts to the ace-jack-ten , also my ace of clubs . Now , Randall . It would have been just as easy for Mamie to bid three hearts on that second go-round . But no ! She could see only her own hand and took us down two , and we could have made five hearts . Now do you say I should have bid three hearts ? " I said , " You were justified not to , Miss Lizzie . " She began to cry on the stairs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You got us beat in the end . May be I 'm getting old . Oh no , that 's not it . Because I can tell you where you got us beat . We 'd know you through and through except we never know what ails you . Do n't you look at me like that . Of course I seep171what Jinny 's doing , the fool , but you ailed first . You just got her answer to it , Ran . " Then she glared again , turned , and went back upstairs . And what ails me I do n't know , Father , unless maybe you know . All through what she had to say I stood holding the cooking-pears . Then I set the basket on the table . Jinny was in the little back study , " Mama 's office , " with the landscape wallpaper and Mr. Comus 's old desk full-up with U.D.C. correspondence and plat maps that cracked like thunder when the fan blew them . She was yelling at Tellie . Tellie came in with the workbasket and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Tellie , I 'll use it when I get ready . Now you go on . Pull your mouth in , you hear ? " Tellie put down the basket and Jinny flicked it open and fished in it . The stork scissors fell out . She found a button that belonged to me , and waited on Tellie . " I hear you 's a mess . " Tellie went out . Jinny looked at me and did n't mind . I minded . I fired pointblank at Jinny  --  more than once . It was close range  --  there was barely room between us suddenlyfor the pistol to come up . And she only stood frowning at the needle I had forgotten the reason for . Her hand never deviated , never shook from the noise . The dim clock on the mantel was striking  --  the pistol had n't drowned that out . I was watching Jinny and I saw her pouting childish breasts , excuses for breasts , sprung full of bright holes where my bulletshad gone . But Jinny did n't feel it . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success . Her thread always went straight in the eye . " Will you hold still . " She far from acknowledged pain  --  anything but sorrow and pain . When I could n't give her something she wanted she would hum a little tune . In our room , her voice would go low and soft to complete disparagement . Then I loved her a lot . The little cheat . I waited on , while she darted the needle and pulled at my sleeve , the sleeve to my helpless hand . It was like counting my breaths . I let out my fury and breathed the pure disappointment in : that she was not dead on earth . She bit the thread  --  magnificently . When she took her mouth away I nearly fell . The cheat . I did n't dare say good-bye to Jinny any more . " All right , now you 're ready for croquet , " she told me . She went upstairs too . Old Tellie spat a drop of nothing into the s we and clanged the lid down as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the swing , sitting . I . old her to come on down to the croquet yard , where we all played Jinny 's game , without Jinny . Going to my room , I saw Miss Billy Texas Spights outdoors in her wrapper , whipping the flowers to make them bloom . Father ! Dear God wipe it clean . Wipe it clean , wipe it out . Do n't let it be . At last Miss Francine caught hold of me in the hall . " Do me a favor , Ran . Do me a favor and put Bella out of her misery . None of these school teachers any better at it than I 'd be . And my friend coming to supper too tenderhearted . You do it . Just do it and do n't tell us about it , hear ? " Where have you been , Son , it 's so late .  --  Nowhere , Mother , nowhere .  --  If you were back under my roof , Mother said , if Eugene had n't gone away too . He 's gone and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too hot to sleep , Mother .  --  I stayed awake by the telephone . The Lord never meant us all to separate . To go and be cut off . One from the other , off in some little room . " I remember your wedding , " old Miss Jefferson Moody said at my window , nodding on the other side of the bars . " Never knew it would turn out like this , the prettiest and longest wedding I ever saw . Look ! If all that money belonged to you , you could leave town . " And I was getting tired , oh so tired , of Maideen waiting on me . I felt cornered when she told me , stillp173as kind as ever , about the Seed and Feed . Because ever since I was born , Old Man Moody lined his sidewalkwith pie pans full of shelled corn and stuff like bird-shot . The window used to be so clouded up it looked like stained glass . She 'd scrubbed it for him , and exposed the barrels and cannisters and the sacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an eyeshade sitting on a stool , making cat's-cradles ; and her poking food at the bird . There were cotton blooms across the window and door , and then it would be sugarcane , and she told me she was thinkingalready about the Christmas tree . No telling what she was going to string on Old Man Moody 's Christmastree . And now I was told her mother 's maiden name . God help me , the name Sojourner was laid on my head like the top teetering crown of a pile of things to remember . Not to forget , never to forget the name of Sojourner . And then always having to take the little Williamsgirl home at night . She was the bridge player . That was a game Maideen had never learned to play . Maideen : I never kissed her . But the Sunday came when I took her to Vicksburg . Already on the road I began to miss my bridge . We could get our old game now , Jinny , Woody , myself , and either Nina Carmichael or Junior Nesbitt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course would walk out on us now , never be our fourth , holding no brief for what a single one of us had done ; she could n't stand the Nesbitts to begin with . I always won  --  Nina used to win , but anybody could see she was pressed too much about Nesbitt to play her cards , and sometimes she did n't come to play at all , or Nesbitt either , and we had to go get the little Williams girl and take her home . Maideen never put in a word to our silence now . She sat holding some women 's magazine . Every now and then she 'd turn over a page , moistening her finger first , like my mother . When she lifted her eyes to me ,  | I did n't look up . Every night I would take their money . Then at Miss Francine 's I would be sick , goingoutdoors so the teachers would n't wonder . " Now you really must get these two home . Their mothers will be wondering . " Jinny 's voice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave , and I thought whatever I let her in for , I could trust her . She would get stupefied for sleep . She would lean farther and farther over in the Starks ' chair . She would never have a rum and coke with us , but would be simply dead for sleep . She slept sitting up in the car going home , where her mama , now large-eyed , maiden name Sojourner , sat up listening . I 'd wake Maideen and tell her where we were . The little Williamsgirl would be chatting away in the back seat , there and as far as her house wide awake as an owl . Vicksburg : nineteen miles over the gravel and the thirteen little bridges and the Big Black . And suddenlyall sensation returned . Morgana I had looked at too long . Till the street was a pencil mark on the sky . The street was there just the same , red-brick scallops , two steeples and the water tank and the branchy trees , but if I saw it , it was not with love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jumped with the shaking of the gin . If some indelible red false-fronts joined one to the other like a little toy train went by , I did n't think of my childhoodany more . I saw Old Man Holifield turn his back , his suspenders looked cross , very cross . In Vicksburg , I stopped my car at the foot of the street under the wall , by the canal . There was that dazzling light , water-marked light . I woke Maideen and asked her if she was thirsty . She smoothed her dress and lifted her head at the sounds of a city , the traffic on cobblestones just behind the wall . I watched the water taxi come to get us , chopping over the canal strip , babyish as a rocking horse.  | " Duck your head , " I told Maideen . " In here ? " It was sunset . The island was very near across the water  --  a waste of willows , yellow and green strands loosely woven together , like a basket that let the light spill out uncontrollably . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceiling in the tiny cabin , and shaded our eyes . The Negro who ran the put-put never said a word , " Get in " or " Get out . " " Where is this we 're going ? " Maideen said . In two minutes we were touching the barge . Nobody was inside but the barkeep  --  a silent , relegated place like a barn , old and tired . I let him bring some rum cokes out to the card table on the back where the two cane chairs were . It was open back there . The sun was going down on the island side while we sat , and making Vicksburg all picked out on the other . East and West were in our eyes . " Do n't make me drink it . I do n't want to drink it , " Maideen said . " Go on and drink it . " " You drink it if you like it . Do n't make me drink it . " " You drink it too . " I looked at her take some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wasps dipping from a nest over the old screen door and skimming her hair . There was a smell of fish and of the floating roots fringing the island , and of the oilcloth top of our table , and endlessdeals . A load of Negroes came over on the water taxi and stepped out sulphur-yellow all over , coated with cottonseed meal . They disappeared in the coloredbarge at the other end , in single file , carrying their buckets , like they were sentenced to it . " Sure enough , I do n't want to drink it . " " Look , you drink it and then tell me if it tastes bad , and I 'll pour ' em both in the river . " " It will be too late . " Through the screen door I could see into the dim saloon . Two men with black cocks under their armsp176had come in . Without noise they each set a muddy boot on the rail and drank , the cocks absolutely still . They got off the barge on the island side and were lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They might never be seen again . The heat shook on the water and on the other side shook along the edges of the old white buildings and the concrete slabs and the wall . From the barge Vicksburg looked like an image of itself in some old mirror  --  like a portrait at a sad time of life . A short cowboy and his girl came in , walking alike . They dropped a nickel in the nickelodeon , and came together . There weren t any waves visible , yet the water did tremble under our chairs . I was aware of it like the sound of a winter fire in the room . " You do n't ever dance , do you , " Maideen said . It was a long time before we left . A good many people had come out to the barge . There was old Gordon Nesbitt , dancing . When we left , the white barge and the nigger barge had both filled up , and it was good-dark . The lights were far between on shore  --  sheds and warehouses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ramparts of town some old iron bells were ringing . " Are you a Catholic ? " I asked her suddenly , and she shook her head . Nobody was a Catholic but I looked at her  --  made it plain she disappointed some hope of mine , and she had , standing there with a foreign bell ringingon the air . " We 're all Baptists . Why , are you a Catholic ? Is that what you are ? " Without touching her except by accident with my knee I walked her ahead of me up the steep unevenway to where my car was parked listing downhill . Inside , she could n't shut her door . I stood outside and waited , the door hung heavily and she hadp177drunk all I had made her drink . Now she could n't shut her door . " Shut it . " " I 'll fall out . I 'll fall in your arms . If I fall , catchme . " No . Shut it . You have to shut it . I ca n't . All your might . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and held on for a moment . I grated up the steep hills , turned and followed the river road along the bluff , turned again off into a deep rutted dirt way under shaggy banks , Father , dark and circling and rushing down . " Do n't lean on me , " I said . " Better to sit up and get air . " " Do n't want to . " " Pull up your head . " I could hardly understand what she said any more . " You want to he down ? " " Do n't want to lie down : ' " You get some air . " " Do n't want to do a thing , Ran , do we , from now and on till evermore . " We circled down . The sounds of the river tossing and teasing its great load , its load of trash , I could hear through the dark now . It made the noise of a moving wall , and up it fishes and reptiles and uprootedtrees and man 's throw-aways played and climbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wave of smell beat at my face . The track had come down here deep as a tunnel . We were on the floor of the world . The trees met and their branches matted overhead , the cedars came together , and through them the stars of Morgana looked sifted and fine as seed , so high , so far . Away off , there was the sound of a shot . " Yonder 's the river , " she said , and sat up . " I see it  --  the Mississippi River . " " You do n't see it . You only hear it " I see it , I see it : '  | " Haven I you ever seen the river before ? You baby . " " I thought we were on it on the boat . Where 's this ? " " The road 's ended . You can see that " " Yes , I can . Why does it come this far and stop ? " " How should I know ? " " What do they come down here for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world . " Far away , somebody was burning something . " You mean bad people ? Niggers ? " " Oh , fishermen . River men . See , you 're waked up . " " I think we 're lost , " she said . Mother said , If I thought you 'd ever go back to that Jinny Stark , I could n't stand it .  --  No , Mother , I 'm not going back .  --  The whole world knows what she did to you . It 's different from when it 's the man . " You dreamed we 're lost . That 's all right , you can lie down a little . " " You ca n't get lost in Morgana . " " After you lie down a little you 'll be all right again . We 'll go somewhere where you can lie down good . " " Do n't want to lie down . " " Did you know my car would back up a hill as steep as this ? " " You 'll be killed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do you think anybody ever saw such a crazy thing ? " We were almost straight up and down , Father , hanging on the wall of the bluff , and the rear end of the car bumping and rising like something that wanted to fly , lifting and dropping us . At last we backed back over the brink , like a bee pulling out of a flower cup , and skidded a little . Without that last drink , maybe I would n't have made it at all . We drove a long way then . All through the dark part , the same old statues and stances , the stone rifles at point again and again on the hills , lost and thep179same . The towers they 've condemned , the lookout towers , lost and the same . Maybe I did n't have my bearings , but I looked for the moon , due to be in the last quarter . There she was . The air was n't darkness but faint light and floatingsound . It was the breath of all the people in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the moon , knowing her quarter . And all along I knew I rode in the open world and took bearingsby the stars . We rode in wildernesses under the lifting moon . Maideen was awake because I heard her sighing , faintly , as if she longed for something for herself . A coon , white as a ghost , pressed low like an enemy , crossed over the road . We crossed a highway and there a light burned in a white-washed tree . Under hanging moss it showed a half-circle of white-washed cabins , dark , and all along it a fence of pale palings . A little nigger boy leaned on the gate where our lights moved on him ; he was wearing a train engineer 's cap . Sunset Oaks . The little nigger hopped on the runningboard , and I paid . I guided Maideen by the shoulders . She had been asleep after all . " One step up , " I told her at the door . We fell dead asleep in our clothes across the iron bed . The naked light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long cord with the strands almost untwisted . Maideen got up after some time and turned the light off , and the night descended like a bucket let down a well , and I woke up . It was never dark enough , the enormous sky flashing with August light rushing into the emptiest rooms , the loneliest windows . The month of falling stars . I hate the time of year this is , Father . I saw Maideen taking her dress off . She bent over all tender toward it , smoothing its skirt and shaking it and laying it , at last , on the room 's chair ; and tenderlylike it was any chairs not that one . I propped myself up against the rods of the bed with my back pressing them . I was sighing  --  deep sigh after deep sigh . I heard myself . When she turned back to the bed , I said , " Do n't come close to me . " And I showed I had the pistol . I said , " I want the whole bed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . I got down in the bed and pointed the pistol at her , without much hope , the way I used to lie cherishing a dream in the morning , and she the way Jinny would come pull me out of it . Maideen came into the space before my eyes , plain in the lighted night . She held her bare arms . She was disarrayed . There was blood on her , blood and disgrace . Or perhaps there was n't . For a minute I saw her double . But I pointed the gun at her the best I could . " Do n't come close to me , " I said . Then while she spoke to me I could hear all the noises of the place we were in  --  the frogs and nightbirdsof Sunset Oaks , and the little idiot nigger runningup and down the fence , up and down , as far as it went and back , sounding the palings with his stick . " Do n't , Ran . Do n't do that , Ran . Do n't do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closer , but when she spoke I was n't hearing what she said . I was reading her lips , the conscientious way people do through train windows . Outside , I thought the little nigger at the gate would keep that up for ever , no matter what I did , or what anyone did  --  running a stick along the fence , up and then down , to the end and back again . Then that stopped . I thought , he 's still running . The fence stopped , and he ran on without knowing it . I drew back the pistol , and turned it . I put the pistol'smouth to my own . My instinct is always quick and ardent and hungry and does n't lose any time . There was Maideen still , coming , coming in her petticoat . " Do n't do it , Ran . Please do n't do it . " Just the same . I made it  --  made the awful sound.  |p181And  she said , " Now you see . It did n't go off . Give me that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take care of it . " She took it from me . Dainty as she always was , she carried it over to the chair ; and prissy as she was , like she knew some long-tried way to deal with a gun , she folded it in her dress . She came back to the bed again , and dropped down on it . In a minute she put her hand out again , differently , and laid it cold on my shoulder . And I had her so quick . I could have been asleep then . I was lying there . " You 're so stuck up , " she said . I lay there and after a while I heard her again . She lay there by the side of me , weeping for herself . The kind of soft , patient , meditative sobs a child will venturelong after punishment . So I slept . How was I to know she would go and hurt herself ? She cheated , she cheated too . Father , Eugenel What you went and found , was it better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at breakfast Eugene MacLain was opening his paper and without the least idea of why he did it , when his wife said some innocent thing to him= Crumb on your chin " or the like  --  he leaned across the table and slapped her face . They were in their forties , married twelve years  --  she was the older : she was looking it now . He waited for her to say " Eugene MacLainl " The oven roared behind her  --  the second pan of toast was under the flame . Almost leisurely  --  that is , he sighed  --  Eugene rose and walked out of the kitchen , holdingon to his paper ; usually he put it in Emma 's band as he gave her the good-bye kiss . He listened for " Eugene ? " to follow him into the chill of the hall and wait for " Yes , dear ? " He saw his face go past the mirror with a smile on it ; that was a memory of little Fan 's fly-away habit of answering her mother  --  and the sticking out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the fair hair screwed up to the first tightenings of vanity  --  =That 's my name . " She had now been dead a year . He put on his raincoat and hat , and secured his paper flat under his arm . Emma was still sitting propped back in her chair between table and stove , with the parrot-tailed housecoat just now settling in a series of puffs about her , and her too small , fat feet , as if they had been the most outraged , propped out before her . He knew the way Emma was lookingp183in the kitchen behind him not because he had ever struck anyone before but because , with her , it was like having eyes in the back of his head . ( Only in the back of his headl ) Why , now , drawing her breath fast in the only warm room , she sat self-hypnotized in her own domain , with her " Get-out-of-my-kitchen " and " **41;4031;TOOLONG ,  --  " all her stiffening and wifely glaze running sweet and finespun as sugar threads over her . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an echo her wounded cry and the shriek of the toast-pan  --  and pulled the apartment door locked behind him . He never could bear the sound of his own name called out in public , and she could still fling open the door and cry " Eugene Hudson MacLain , come here to mel " down the stairs . A tremor ran through his arm as it struggled with the front door , and he stepped through to the outside and the perfectly still , foggy morning . He let his breath out , and there it was : he could see it . The air , the street , a sea gull , all the same soft gray , were in the same degree visible and seemed to him suddenly as pure as his own breath was . The sea gull like a swinging pearl came walking across Jones Street as if to join him . " Our sea gulls have become so immured to San Francisco life , " he would remark on walking in Bertsingers =for you came in to work with a humorous remark= they even cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have hurt Emma . There could n't be a mark on her . She was stronger than he was , 15o pounds to 139 , he could inform old Mr. Bertsinger Senior , who liked to press for figures . He and Emma MacLain could at any time be printed in the paper where all could see , side by side naked and compared , in those testimonialsilhouettes ; maybe had been . Emma knew he had n't hurt her ; better than he knew , Emma knew.  |p184He  sighed gently . By now  --  for she did take things in slowly  --  the rosy mole might be riding the pulse in her throat as it did long after the telephone rang late in the night and was the wrong number  --  ! ' Why , it might have been a thousand things . " Pretty soon , with her middle finger she would start touching her hairpins , one by one , going over her head as though in finishing her meditations she was sewing some precautionary cap on . Eugene was walking down the habitual hills to Bertsingers% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pained him after breakfast he was taking note of the day , its temperature , fog condition , and prospects of clearing and warming up , all of which would be asked him by Mr. Bertsinger Senior who would then tell him if he was right . Why , in the name of all reason , had he struck Emma ? His act with that , proving it had been a part of him  --  slipped loose from him , turned around and looked at him in the form of a question . At Sacramento Street it skirted through traffic beside him in sudden dependency , almost like a comedian pretending to be an old man . If Eugene had not known he could do such a thing as strike Emma , he was even less prepared for having done it . Down hill the eucalyptus trees seemed biggerin the fog than when the sun shone through them , they had the fluffiness of birds in the cold ; he had the utterly strange and unamiable notion that he could hear their beating hearts . Walking down a very steep lull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen it like that or particularly noticed himself reflected in these people 's windows . His head and neck jerked in motions like a pigeon 's ; he looked down , and when he saw the fallen and purple eucalyptus leaves underfoot , his shoes suddenly stamped them hard as hooves . A quarrel could n't even grow between him and Emma . And she would be unfair , beg the question , if a quarrel did spring up ; she would cry . That was ap185thing a stranger might feel on being introduced to Emma , even though Emma never proved it to anybody : she had a waterfall of tears back there . He walked on . The sun , smaller than the moon , rolled like a little wheel through the fog but gave no light yet . Why strike her even softly ? They were n't very lovinglyinclined these days , with the heart taken out of them by sorrow ; violence was out of place to begin with . Why not strike her ? And if she thought he would stay around only to hear her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let her take care and go about her business , he might do it once more and not so kindly . If he had had time to think about it , he might simply have refused to eat his breakfast . He knew that she minded . Ever since Emma was a landlady calling " Come on quick , Mr. MacLainl " and he was an anxiousroomer , he had known where she was sensitive . Actually , of course , he would n't have dared not eat  --  under any circumstances . If he had wanted to kill her , he would have had to eat everything on her table first , and praise it . She had had a first husband , the mighty Mr. Gaines , and she would love forever a compliment on her food . " Sit down and tell me what you see " was what Emma would say . The present fact was that she 'd said something innocent  --  innocentbut personal , personal but not dear  --  to him , which she might have said a thousand times in twelve years of marriage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over to remove some offense of his with her own motherly finger , and he had slapped her face today . Why slap her today ? The question prodded him locally now , in the back of one knee as nearly as he could tell . It accommodated itself like the bang of a small bell to the stiff pull of his shanks . He struck her because she was a fat thing . Absurd , she had always been fat , at least plump ( " Your little landlady 's forever busy with something nice ! " ) ,  | plump when he married her . Always was is no reason for its being absurd even yet to  --  But could n't it be his reason for hitting her , and not hers ? He struck her because he wanted another love . The forties . Psychol-ogNevertheless a face from nowhere floated straight into that helpless irony and contemplated the world of his inward gaze , a dark full-face , obscure and obedient-lookingas a newsprint face , looking outward from its cap of dark hair and a dark background  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jones Street . Miss Dimdummie Dumwiddie , he could the same as read underneath , in the italics of poetry . A regardful look . Should he suspect ? She had died , was that the story ? Then too late to love you now . Too late to verify this story of yours . . . in the paper , though he was carrying the paper for any such possiblereference , pinned there by his right arm . This morning it had become too late to love the young and dead Miss Dumwiddie , and he had struck his wife with the flat of his hand . Eugene slowed his step obediently here ; at the jobbing butcher 's he was habitually caught . Without warning red and white beeves were volleyed across the sidewalk on hooks , out of a van . The butchers , stepped outside for a moment in their bloody aprons , made a pause for ladies sometimes , but never for men . The beeves were moving across , all right , and on the other side a tramp leaned on a cane to watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carcasses as it went by ; it could have been some haughty and spurningwoman he kept catching like that . At the go-ahead from the butcher , made with a knife , Eugene took one step , but stopped suddenly . It was out of the question  --  that was all of a sudden beautifully clear  --  that he should go to work that day . And things were a great deal more serious than he had thought . Delicately and slowly as if he had been dared ,  |p187Eugene  felt with his hand under his raincoat , touchingcoat and vest and silver pencil . He clung to one small revelation : that today he was not able to take those watches apart . He had only reached California Street . He stood without moving at the brink of the great steepness , looking down . He had struck Emma and when he struck , her face had met his blow with blankness , a wide-open eye . It had been like kissing the cheek of the dead . She could still bite his finger , could n't she ? and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joy before darting ahead . But he looked down at the steepness , shocked and almost numb . A passerby gave him a silent margin . The slap had been like kissing the cheek of the dead . What would Mr. Bertsinger Senior , down at the shop , have to say about this , Eugene wondered , what lengthy thing ? His watch opened in the palm of his hand , and then he was walking on again with protest and speed down the hill , the street like the sag of a rope that disappeared into fog . The world was the old man 's subject , but he knew yours . Below in Market Street the fog ran high overhead and the bustle of life was revealed . Eugene could imitate his hurry . Could it seem at all sad or absurd to the others , he wondered  --  with his head seeming to float above his long steps  --  that Market had with the years become a street of trusses , pads , braces , false bosoms , false teeth , and glass eyes ? And of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store where the shark liver oil pellets were displayed ( really attractively , to tell the truth ) on a paper lacy as a Valentine . How amazing it all was . Was n't it ? A sailor in the penny arcade was having his girl photographed in the arms of a stuffed gorilla . Eugene would like to show that to somebody.  | He read the second story level of signs across the street , Joltz Nature System , Honest John Trusses , No Toothless Days . A lady carrying a streetcar transfer slip and a bunch of daisies wrapped in newspaper was coming down the stairs from the No Toothless Days door ; would she dare smile , supposing she heard of a little joke , horseplay , would there be any use in telling her ? In the flyblown window of a bookstore a dark photographthat looked at first glance like Emma ( Emma , he could bet , still sat on at the table composing herself , as carefully as if she had been up to the ceiling and back ) was , he read below , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pursuing some necessity , a jewelry store ; so that if you wore a Strictform No Give Brace you could wear at the same time a butterfly breast pin or a Joy watch band , " Nothing but Gold to Touch the Flesh . " It could all make a man feel shame . The kind of shame one had to jump up in the air , kick his heels , to express  --  whirl around ! Just on the other side of Bertsingers ' there was a crowded market . Eugene could hear all day as he worked at his meticulous watches the glad mallet of the man who cracked the crabs . He could hear it more plainly now , mixed with the street noises , like the click and caw of a tropical bird , and the doorway there shimmered with the blue of Dutch iris and the mixed pink and white of carnations in tubs , and the bright clash of the pink , red , and orange azaleas lined up in pots . Oh , to have been one step further on , and grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little elderly-like rap , and he recognized that Bertsingers ' was more respectablethan most of the jewelry stores : Mr. Bertsinger Senior was on hand . Bertsingers ' did carry its brand of the rhinestone Pegasus and ruby swordfish , its tray of charms ; and the diamond rings filling the window did each bear a neat card saying " With Full Trade-inp189Privilege . " But the cards were in Mr. Bertsinger Senior 's handwriting  --  fine and with shaded loops . And Bertsingers ' never had a neon sign over his cage in the repair department . There was some dignity left to everything , if you knew where to find it . And Eugene passed by the door . Bertie Junior was up front and on the lookout for what he might miss , of course  --  Eugene took a chance . Bertie Junior 's thumbs bent softly back , he had little ducktails at the back of his head , he looked privileged as well as young . He 'd put a chip diamond in his Army discharge button , for the hell of it he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gleam and his eagerness could be detected from the street , and there was an equal chance he might detect Eugene going by , his target on any occasion . But he came to the door with head lifted high at that moment , watching a fist fight come out of a barber shop . He gleamed even to the sideways glance , wearing two fountain pens , their clips forking tongue-like out of his stillsoldierlybreast . Eugene got by . He was not called back , either , or discovered pausingso near , at the market . The fish windows were decorated like a holiday show . There was a double row of salmon steaks placed fan-wise on a tray , and filets of sole fixed this way and that down another tray as in a plait , like cut-off golden hair . When Eugeneset his eyes on an arrangement of amber-red caviar in the shape of a large anchor , " They are fish eggs , sir , " a young , smocked clerk said , " and personallyI think it 's a perfect pity that they should be allowed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market entrance and did not recognize Mr. MacLain who had repaired his watch at all , that little drudge . A yearning for levity took hold of the little drudge , he tipped his hat and bowed like a Southerner , to the fish eggs . There was a soft gleam . Above , blue slides of sky were cutting in on the fog . The sun , as with a spurt of motion , came out . The streetcars , taking on banana colors , drove up and down , the line of movie houses fluttered streamers and flags as if they were going to sea . Eugene moved into the central crowd , which seemed actually to increase its jostling with the sunshine , like the sea with wind . A little old tramp woke up on the street , and rubbed his eyes . He began scattering crumbs to the descending pigeons and sea gulls . They walked about him fussing like barnyard chickens , and he stood as if flattered by their transformation and their greed , pressing his knees together in the posture of a saint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile at the world . Eugene walked among crumbs and pigeons and crossed over the wide trashy street and when he looked to the right he could see , quite clearly just now , the twin brown-green peaks at the end of the view , the houses bright in their sides , while the lifted mass of blue and gray fog swayed as gently over them as a shade tree . The lift of fog in the city , that daily act of revelation , brought him a longing now like that of vague times in the past , of long ago in Mississippi , to see the world  --  there were places he longed for the sight of whose names he had forgotten . And while now it was doubtful that he would ever see the Seven Wondersof the World , he had suggested to Emma that they take a simple little pleasure trip  --  modestly , on the bus  --  down the inexpensive side of the Peninsula ; but it had been his luck to mention it on the anniversaryof Fan 's death and she had slammed the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it now . The inviolablegrief she had felt for a great thing only widened her capacity to take little things hard . Mourning over the same thing she mourned , he was not to be let in . For letting in was something else . How cold to the living hour grief could make yout Her eye was quite marble-like at the door crack.  |p191There  had been a time , too , when she was a soft woman , just as he had been a kind man , soft unto innocence  --  soft like little Fan , and he saw the child at bedtime letting her hair ripple down and all around , with it almost meeting under her chin like a little golden rain hat , and he wanted to say , " Oh , stay , wait . " Just as the other thing was there too : Fan from the age she could walk to it was standing with her back to the fire ( they kept an open fireplace then ) and with that gesture like a curtsey was lifting up her gown to warm her backside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too late when the city opened out so softly in beauty and to such distances , it awoke a longing for that careless , patched land of Mississippi winter , trees in their rusty wrappers , slow-grown trees taking their time , the lost shambles of old cane , the winter swamp where his own twin brother , he supposed , still hunted . Eugene looked askance at a flower seller : where had the seasons gone ? Too cheap , bewilderinglymassed together , the summerlike , winterlike , springlike flowers tied up in bunches made him glance disparately at the old man marking down the price on a jug of tulips , and at three turbaned Hindus who bought nothing but in calm turn smelled the bouquetsuntil they stood there with all their six eyes closed , translated into still another world . " Open the door , Richard ! " sang a hoarse , nigger voice from a pitch-black bar . A small Chinese girl , all by herself , with her hair up in aluminum curlers , went around Eugene , swinging a little silky purse . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stocky boy with a black pompadour went by him wearing taps on his shoes , some word waited unspoken on Eugene 's lips . His chance for speaking tapped rhythmically by . He frowned in the street , the more tantalized , somehow , by seeing at the last minute that the stranger was tattooed with a butterfly on the inner side of his wrist ; an intimate place , the wrist appeared to be.  | Eugene saw the butterfly plainly enough to recognize it again , when this unfamiliar , callused hand of San Francisco put a flame to a bitten cigarette . In blue ink the double wings spanned the veins and the two feelers reached into the fold at the base of the hand ; the spots were so deep they seemed to have come perilously near to piercing the skin . It was then that Eugene  --  withdrawing one step in his thoughts , to where old Mr. Bertsinger Senior in his jeweler 's glass doddered around , the most criticaland slowest to appraise of men , and Bertie Junior waited , knowing without being told ( nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some absolute way that no familiar person could do him any good . After the step he had taken , the thing he had done , he could n't stop at all , he had to go on , go in this new direction . Friends : no help there . In panic  --  and , it struck him , in exultation  --  seek a stranger . Hi , mate . Just lammed the little wifey over the puss .  --  Horrayl  --  That 's what I did .  --  Sure , not a bad idea once ever so often . Take it easy . They would be perched up at a bar having a beer together . And the other man would turn out to have done a whole lot worse ; in fact , something should be done about him . A tortoise-shell cat pillowed in apples gazed at him from a grocer 's window . She pulled her round eyes closed as on little drawstrings . Eugene recollectedthat one street back a plaster bull dog , cerise with blue rings around the eyes , which ordinarily sat in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shade and the glass , had this morning been taken away . Eugene had missed it been cheated of it . As the cat opened her eyes again he had a moment of believing he would know anything that happened , anything that threatened the moral way , or transformedit , even , in the city of San Francisco that day : as if he and the city were watching each other  --  withoutaccustomed faith . But with interest . . . boldness .. recklessness , almost.  |p193Eugene  proceeded down Market , his stride as brisk , businesslike , and concealing as though he had not already left Bertsingers ' far behind . Bright mist bathed this end of the street and hid the tower of the Ferry Building ; but as he walked he saw , going ahead of him and in the same direction , a tall and distinct figure that he recognized . It was the Spaniard he had heard play the guitar at Aeolian Hall the evening before . Imagine him walking along here ! And as far as Eugene could make out over the heads of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no doubts about that identity . Last night though it seemed long enough ago now to make the recognition clever  --  Emma had come out with Eugene to a music hall , and it had turned out that this Spaniard performed , in solo recital . ( No , she would not go with him to Half Moon Bay , but she would consent to a little music in one of the smaller halls , she said , and added , " Though you do n't appreciate music . " He patted her shoulder ; they must have been thinking it together : his failure to respect music was part of the past , a night with little Fan at the Symphony , her treat . When the music began the child had held out her little arms , saying Pierre Monteauxcame out of Babar and she wanted him down here and would spank him . Emma , honestly shocked , had pulled down her daughter 's arms , and Eugene had laughed out loud , not then but in the middle of the next piece . ) . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was pretty observant the way he recognized the man at this distance and from the back , after seeing him only the one time and then over the bird of a lady 's hat . He was alluring , up ahead  --  the perfect being to catch up with . Eugene walked steadily and looked steadily at him , a stranger and yet not a stranger , goingalong measuredly and sedately before , the only black-clad figure on this Western street , head and shoulders above all the rest . And the very next moment , something terrible almosthappened . The guitarist reached the curb and in entering the traffic  --  really , he was quite provocatively slow , moving through this city street  --  he almost walked beneath the wheels of an automobile . With the other 's sudden danger , a gate opened to Eugene . That was all there was to it . He did not have time to think , but sprang forward as if to protect his own . His paper flew away from him piecemeal and as he ran he felt his toes pointing out behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been noted for his running when he was a boy back home ; in Morgana , Mississippi , he was still little old Scooter MacLain . He seized hold of the Spaniard 's coat which had him weighing it , smelling it , and feeling the sun warm on it and pulled . So out of breath he was laughing , he pulled in the big Spaniard  --  who for all his majesticweight proved light on his feet , like a big woman who turns graceful once she 's on the dance floor . For a moment Eugene kept him at tow there , on the safe curb , breathing his faint smoke-smell or travel-smell ; but he could not think of that long Spanishname , and he did n't say a word . Well , what did that matter , when he was so relieved , so delighted , that he had reached the big old person in time  --  as delighted as with the surprise of a gift ? Eugene drew both hands away lightly , as if he were publicly disclosing something , unveiling a huge statue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook hands , and even in that self-conscious greeting Eugene discovered something that made him want to turn his back and say " Damn it all ! " The Spaniard could not speak English . At least he smiled and did not . Proof , was n't it ? Eugene felt overwhelmed , cut off  --  disappointed in the man 's very life . He pumped the substantial arm , taking an extra moment to recover himself , not top195appear quite this disconcerted , or so rejected ; he had entirely surprised himself . Then the order of things seemed to be that the two men should stroll on together down the street . That came out of the very helplessness of not being able to speak  --  to thank or to deprecate . As he walked , Eugene sent out shy , still respectful glances , those of a man not quite sure his new pet knows who has just come into possession . Now that he thought back , the big fellow had walked out in front of the automobile almost tempting it to try and get him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighter . There was another kind of Spaniard ! Eugene looked up at his prize again , quite closely . The artist , who now smoked a cigarette , was wholly as imperturbable , if not quite as large bodily , as he had seemed on the Aeolian Hall stage the evening before . At that time , he appeared carrying ahead of him a guitar , majestic and seeming in his walk years older than his thick black hair would show . He walked across the stage without a glance at the audience  --  an enormous man in an abundant dress suit with long , heavy tails . As he reached the center front of the stage and turned gravely  --  he seemed serious as a doctor  --  his head looked weighty too , long and broad together , with black-rimmed glasses circling his eyes and his hair combed back to hang behind him almost to his shoulders , like an Indian , or the old senator from back home . He lowered himself to the straight chair that was the only furnishing of the stage except for an oblong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Then he sat there like a mountain . This was just the sort of preliminary to-do that Emma liked ; Eugene felt her draw herself up in the kind of bodily indignation that was her quickest expression of pleasurewhen she was out in public . The guitarist began to play only after many tender and prolonged attentions to his instrument . He tuned it so softly that only he could hear . Then he gave some care to his extended right foot , which the black oblong object was there to accommodate as a rest , and care most of all to his fingers  --  flexing all ten of them , stretching them leisurely upon his thighs like a cat testing her claws on a cushion . His face in the stage light , dark-skinned , smooth , with two deep folds from his nose down the sides of his mouth , was unmoved or even affronted in its stage expression . It did not change while he played or duringthe applause that came after each song . Only at the very last of the applause after the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his face  --  and to be enjoying itself there ; it had the enchanted presence of a smile on the face of a beast . It lasted just so long , like an act of strength  --  as long as a strong man might hold a lifted weight . Yet it had been as clear and gradual a change as the light goes through at sunset . It hinted of ordeal , but the smile showed that like the audience , after all , he loved the extraordinary thing . His fingernails were painted bright red . " Red fingernails , " Eugene had whispered , just at the moment when Emma turned her head and gave him a look . It was meant to be a meaningful look from under the brim of the blue hat in which she had that night emerged from public-mourning . The blueness of the hat even in the light of the dim hall ( " Emma 's blue , " her sister called it ) and the blank shine of her new glasses which hid her eyes , and her cheek with a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward her as though she had bidden it , but did not distract him from a deep lull in his spirit that was as enfolding as love . He turned his head gently back toward the stage , where an encore was being played . A most unexpected kind of music was being struck off the guitar . He felt a lapse of all knowledge of Emma as his wife , and of comprehending the future , in some visit to a vast present-time . The lapse must have enduredp197for a solid minute or two , and afterwards he could recollect it . It was as positively there and as defined at the edges as a spot or stain , and it affected him like a secret . Now out here in the everyday and the open , Eugenewas aware , as at the racing of the pulse , of the dark face by his , the Spaniard going beside him , his life actually owing to him , Eugene MacLain . Again he felt fleet of foot , at the very heels of a secret in the day . Was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at us , like the apples of Atalanta perhaps , once we have begun a certain onrush ? With his hand , which could have stormed a gate , he touched the Spaniard 's elbow . It responded like a swinging weight , a balance , in the calm black sleeve . Eugene 's touch , his push , now seemed judicious ; and he pushed forthrightly to propel the old fellow across the street at the next crossing . Once , waiting for a traffic light to change , they stood beside a woman on whom Eugene let his gaze rest . There was such strange beauty about her that he did not realize for a few moments that she was birth-marked and would be considered disfigured by most people  --  by himself , ordinarily . She was a Negro or a Polynesian and marked as a butterfly is , over all her visible skin . Curves , scrolls , dark brown areas on light brown , were beautifully placed on her body , as if by design , with pools about the eyes , at the nape of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , like fawn spots , visible through her stockings . She had the look of waiting in leafy shade . She was dressed in humble brown , but her hat was an exotic one , with curving bright feathers about her head . Eugene felt an almost palpable aura of a disgraceor sadness that had to be as ever-present as the skin is , of hiding and flaunting together . It was so strong an aura that by softly whistling Eugene pretended to people around that the woman was not there , and tried to keep the Spaniard from seeing her . For he might pounce upon her ; something made him afraid of the Spaniard at that moment . After a little it seemed something of a favor , a privilege , to be unable to communicate any more than by smiles and signs . They strolled along together . The Spaniard appeared content enough to walk along in the soft , mild sun with the little man who undertook to pull him out of the way of wheels . He did not object . He neither hurried nor revealed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Where were they going , thought Eugene , he and his Spaniard ? They were still walking down Market Street past the shoddy , catch-eye stores . And just now they were approaching a shabby spot only too familiarto Eugene ; he had to pass it every day , since it was between Bertsingers ' and the cafeteria where he daily ate lunch . A side-show had opened to take its turn in the rundownbuilding where previously some gypsies had been telling fortunes . There were posters in the dirty windows and a languid , enthroned man offering tickets and intoning all day long the words , " Haveyou  --  seen  --  Em-ma ? " in a voice so tired it gave the effect of downright menace . Bertie Junior thought it was terribly funny , with old MacLain 's wife being named Emma . He came along with Eugene to lunch now , so he could hear it , and every morning he too asked , " Have  --  you  --  seen  --  Emma ? " as Eugene came in , before he could get past . An enlarged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her small features bunched like a paper of violets in the center of her face . But in the crushed , pushed-together countenance there was a look ; it was accusation , of course . The sight of a person to whom other people have been cruel can be the most formidable of all , Eugene thought as he was ready to pass it again . And it is so recognizable , the glance that meets all glances and holds , like a mother 's : they done me wrong.  |p199The  photograph showed Emma as wearing lace panties , and opposite it a real pair of panties  --  faded red with no lace  --  was exhibited hung up by clothespins , vast and sagging , limp with dust and travel . In his childhood , Eugene recalled , there was a Thelma that he had paid his Sunday School collection money to see . Thelma was an optical illusion , a woman 's head on top of a stepladder ; and she had been golden-haired and young , and had smiled invitingly . Eugene all at once felt himself the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at Emma , inside ? It gave him an appalling moment . But the Spaniard , cocking his head at Emma 's fullsailedmanifestation , simply pointed to his own breadth and opened his eyes on Eugene with one warm , brimming question of his own . It was midday . The street beggars knew it , they sat light-drenched , the blind accordion player with his eyes wide open and his lips formed in a kiss . " Come on . I 'm inviting you , all right . We 'll eat , " Eugene said , and tipping his finger to his companion 's elbow turned him right around . Eugene thought as if in the nick of time  --  that only a good restaurant would do . Besides , though the cafeteriawas economical and healthy , just now it had begun to be infested by those wiry , but unlucky , old men forever reading racing forms as they drank coffee ; one particularly , in a belligerent pea-green sweater with yellow bands , seemed to change the whole tone of the place simply by always occupying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of where they were going , perhaps , in his smile , Eugene pulled open the door to a restaurant in Maiden Lane . The Spaniard , with the merest lift of his black brows , walked in shaking the floor around him and proceeded up the staircase , shaking it , to the littlep202Why waste them ? Why not visit a gambling house ? A game of chance would be very interesting . With those red-nailed fingers ( only  --  and Eugene 's hope fell  --  they were not red now ) the Spaniard would be able to place their chips on lucky numbers , and with his sharp and shaming ear listen to the delicate , cheatingclick of the ball in the wheel . Eugene usually only pressed his lips together  --  to part them  --  at the idea of such places , but with the Spaniard along  --  1 For them , as for young , unattached , dashing boys , or renegade old men far gone , the roulette wheel all evening in some smoke-filled but ascetic room .. . how would it be ? Suppose he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day and a night , say , and not for the rest of his life ? Suppose he was still in the process of leaving Mississippi  --  not stopped here , but simply an artist , touring through . Or , if he chanced not to play the guitar or something , simply out looking : not for anyone in particular ; on the track , say , of his old man ? ( God forbid he 'd find him ! Old Papa King MacLainwas an old goat , a black name he had . ) From right here , himself stopped in San Francisco , Eugene could have told the artist something . This city . . . often it looked open and free , down through its long-sighted streets , all in the bright , washing light . But hill and hill , cloud and cloud , all shimmering one back of the other like purities or transparencies of clear idleness and blue smoke , lifting and going down like the fire-sirens that forever curved through the place , and traveling water-bright one upon the other  --  they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time it would be terrifying if walls , even the walls of Emma 's and his room , the walls of whatever room it was that closed a person in in the evening , would go soft as curtains and begin to tremble . If like the curtains of the aurora borealis the walls of rooms would give even the illusion of lifting  --  if they would threaten to go up . That would be repeatingthe Fire  --  of course . That could happen any timep203to San Francisco . It was a special threat out here . But the thing he thought of was n't really physical ... . Eugene slowly buttered the last crust of bread . There was nothing to change his mind about the Spaniard  --  to make him think that this sedate man , installed on the lighted stage with his foot on a rest the way he liked to present himself , had n't a secret practice of going out to a dark and shady place on his own , and would n't seek out as a further preoccupationin his life some stranger 's disgrace or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was natural to suppose , supposed Eugene , that the solidest of artists were chameleons . What might n't this Spaniard be capable of ? Eugene felt untoward visions churning , the Spaniardwith his great knees bent and his black slippers turning as if on a wheel 's rim , dancing in a red smoky place with a lead-heavy alligator . The Spaniardturning his back , with his voluminous coat-tails sailing , and his feet off the ground , floating bird-like up into the pin-point distance . The Spaniard with his finger on the page of a book , looking over his shoulder , as did the framed Sibyl on the wall in his father 's study  --  no ! then , it was old Miss Eckhart 's " studio " where he was muscular , but in a story-like way womanly . And the Spaniard with horns on his head  --  waiting  --  or advancing ! And always the one , dark face , though momently fire from his nostrils brimmed over , with that veritable waste of life ! Eugene , unaccustomed to visions of people as they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Spaniard as he was , choked abruptly on his crust . He had even forgotten all about old Miss Eckhartin Mississippi , and the lessons he and not Ran had had on her piano , though perhaps it was natural that he should remember her now , within the aura of music . Experimentally he let down one by one the touchy , nimble fingers of his left hand on the table , then little finger and thumb see-sawed . The Spaniard as if through a curtain still seemed about to breathe fire . Across the table his incessant cigarette smoke came out of his nostrils in a double spout . It was this that was smelling so sweet . . . Eugene seemed to hear the extending cadence of " The Stubborn RockingHorse , " a piece of his he always liked , and could play very well . He saw the window and the yard , with the very tree . The thousands of mimosa flowers , little puffs , blue at the base like flames , seemed not to hold quite steady in this heat and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into drops of light , plopping one , two , three , four , through sky and trees to earth , to lie there in the pattern opposite to the shade of the tree . He could feel his forehead bead with drops and the pleasure run like dripping juice through each plodding finger , at such an hour , on such a day , in such a place . Mississippi . A humming bird , like a little fish , a little green fish in the hot air , had hung for a moment before his gaze , then jerked , vanishing , away . He held his glass again to the Filipino 's pitcher . Eugene saw himself for a moment as the kneeling Man in the Wilderness in the engraving in his father 's remnant geography book , who hacked once at the Traveler 's Tree , opened his mouth , and the water came pouring in . What did Eugene MacLain really care about the life of an artist , or a foreigner , or a wanderer , all the same thing  --  to have it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had once believed , represented his father , King MacLain , in the flesh , the one who had never seen him or wanted to see him . A Filipino dropped a dish which broke to pieces on the floor and sent the food spilling . Eugene felt his face growing pointed with derogatory , yet pitying , truly pitying sounds . He was laughing at the Filipino ; and all the time , out of the whole room , perhaps , only he knew how excruciating this small mishap probably was . But he had got his money mentally counted up . He found he could pay for this affair , almost exactly ,  |p205with  a few pennies left over . It made the awe of the thing settle a little and go down . The Spaniard had attracted some attention from the room , spitting out the bones of his special dish , breaking the bread and clamping it in his teeth with the sound of firecrackers . His black eyes were amiably following a little fly now . Dishes , hats , ladies ' noses , curtains at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his little choices . The Spaniard seemed to be playing the mildest little game with himself . This was what he was like when he was not playing the guitar . Yet he was not so bad . When the waiter came with the bill , Eugene paid for the extravagance quite eagerly . The sight , the memory now , of the aloof and ravenous face opposite his , dark in the pearly window light , and the sorrowful mouth devouringthe very best food until all had disappeared except for a pile of bones and a frill of paper  --  this filled him with a glow that began to increase while they smilingly nodded and rose . Like a peacock 's tail the papered wall seemed lazily to extend now from the table at which they had sat . As they walked among the tables to leave , the Spaniard reaching out and gently taking a number of match packets , in a breeze of succession the women in their large hats leaned toward one another , the flowery brims touching , and murmured some name , and glanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deaf , possessivefashion . They came out into the flat light of day and the noise , like a deception or a concealment of rage , of the ordinary afternoon stir . As they paused on the walk , a streetcar not far away roared down a crowded street . With the air of a fool or a traitor , so the crowd felt all together  --  there was a feeling like a concussion in the air  --  a dumpy little woman tripped forward on high heels in the street , swung her purse like a hatful of flowers , spilling everything , and sank in an outrageous-looking pink color in the streetcar's path . In a moment the streetcar struck her . She was pitched about , thrown ahead on the tracks , then let alone ; she was not run over by the car , but she was dead . Eugene could tell that , as they all could , by the slow swinging walk of the pair of policemen who saw everything and now had to take charge . This pair saw no use in the world to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeated , that is . His voice must have told the Spaniard that this should be of special interest to him . The big man stood planted , his lower lip jutted out under his cigarette , his eyes squinting . It was unquestionably a very horrible thing . Nobody hurried . " She 's dead , I 'm pretty sure , " Eugene said , but determined to keep his single voice a cautious one . Other voices close by were speaking . The Spaniard was shaking his head . " Why do n't the ambulance come ? " " Look at the motorman . His fault . " " She had gray hair . " Shake of the head . " Somebody ought to pick up all those things and get them back in her purse . " " Do n't they cover them up ? " " I wonder who she was . " " Who will they know to tell ? " Shake of the head . The Spaniard shook his head . " Let 's go . " Two girls spoke , turning . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a hollow square of people , hid the victim . They flanked her , and not all the time , but at moments , looked down at her . They held their ranks closed , like valuable persons . They were going to have been there . The group , businessmen , lady shoppers and children , seemed to consider themselves gently floating like the passengers on a raft , a little way out . One youth , hand on hip , looked with deep , idle , inward gaze at a street sparrow by his foot , andp207then , beside the sparrow 's little foot was the dead woman 's open purse . " Well  --  1 " They went around the corner , the Spaniard still shaking his head at moments . At a glance he looked as if he thought the place could n't be any good , really . Eugene led him to a big hotel . They entered the glitter and perfume of the lobby and through its entiremaze before Eugene could discover the men 's room , feeling the responsibility of the big black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their caves with the echoing partitionbetween , Eugene 's head nodded and rolled once or twice rhythmically ... . Well , the music last night had not been what he had thought it would be . In prophesying that , Emma had known what she was talking about . It was not at all throbbing  --  and of course not nigger . It had not a great many chords , it was never loud . The Spaniard 's songs were old  --  ancient , his program said ; some of them were written for organs and for lutes ; and yet , he , So-and-So , the guitarist , played them . Were the difficulties and challenges what he had sought for most ? Vain old person . Yes , it is the guitar I am playing . Yes , I am a guitar player . What did you think I was ? He was in as overwhelming a degree as if he announcedit from the stage  --  in English  --  an extremely careful old person , an extremely careful artist . Eugene suddenly felt both impatient and offended with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was playing , the man took no notice or care that he pleased anyone else either .... No ! And Eugene had not been carried away altogether by the Spaniard 's music . Not by any means . Only when the man at last played very softly some unbearably rapid or subtle songs of his own country , so soft as to be almost without sound , only a beating on the air like a fast wing  --  then was Eugene moved . Sometimesthe sounds seemed shaken out , not struck , with the unearthly faint crash of a tambourine . In love songs as in the rest , the artist himself remainedremote , as a conscientious black cloud from a summer day . He only loomed . He ended the recital with a formal bow  --  as though it had been taken for granted by then that passion was the thing he had in hand , love was his servant , and even despair was a little tamed animal trotting about in plain view . The bow had been consummate with grace , and when he lifted up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . When Eugene came out , the Spaniard was weighinghimself . The arrow trembled , the Spaniard gently regarding it , filling himself with a sigh to make it shake . Eugene frowned at the figure . Only 240 . He had supposed the Spaniard would weigh more than that 25o or 255 . His guest looked at him as bright and fresh as a daisy . " Where shall we go now ? " he meant , as plain as day . Eugene ushered him to the street . On the step was a band of sunlight soft and level as little Fan 's hair when she would go flying before him . The men beganwalking , the Spaniard with spirit  --  was this exercise ? The square shone , and the facade of a steep street like a great gray accordion spread over a knee seemed about to stutter into the air . They walked city squares in the sun until some meditativemood between them bound them like consentingspeech . At a corner two old fellows , twins , absurdly dressed alike in plaid jackets , the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crowded step of a streetcar . Eugene and the Spaniardnoticed them at the same moment and casting each other amused glances , they stepped up too , asp209the car began moving , and rode off on the step . It was like surf-boarding on waves . Behind them , the cow-catcher was a big basketful of children . A Negro , his fan of hair so coarse as to look grainy , immediately rammed his head between Eugene 's and the Spaniard 's . His pop-eyes watched . The streetcar climbed , rolled , and descended , rocking through warming and ever-crowding streets , and finally turned straight into the West . Eugene , with his head turned away from the Negro 's , tried to close his ears against the cries of the children , and read the tattered street signs to himself as they passed . The conductor was a big fat Negro woman who yelled out all the street names with joy . " Divisaderol I say Divisadero ! " At The Bug Used Records and Shoe Massage Parlor , and from the steep , fancyfronted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the solitary houses over railroad cuts seen once  --  the conductor 's friends hollered at her as they went by . Swinging out of the car she often called back . " Off at two A.M ! " " See you at the Cat ! " The Negro head between Eugene and the Spaniard rolled its eyes . Once Eugene caught a glimpse of the Spaniard smiling as he traveled . Niggers would think he comprehended all their nigger-business  --  that he himself might be at the Cat at two . The basket of children swarmed over . Eugene managed to reach the bell . He got the Spaniard off the streetcar , actually having to pull him by the waist to extricate him backwards . It was too much . They continued their direction on foot , still into the sun and still up into the last rim of hills . It was by rights a sleepy hour , for people who did n't have to work . The city was so ugly at close quarters and so beautiful down its long distances . The hills , hills after hills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the warmth of the nearer sun , all made Eugene feel as if he were falling asleep . Because the very silence between the men was  --  at last replete and dream-like , the hills were to Eugene.  | increasingly like those stairs he climbed in dreams . The hills with their uniform , unseparated houses repeated over and over again his hill on Jones Street ; the houses occurred over and over  --  all built on the same day , all one age . There was all one destiny . Supposeanother Fire were to rack San Francisco and topple it and he , Eugene MacLain out of Mississippi , had to put it all back together again . His eyes half closed upon the mountains of houses not wall-like , as houses were in other places , but swollen like beehives , and one hive succeeding another , mounting into tremendous steps of stairs  --  and alive inside , inwardly contriving . How could he put a watch back to-gether ? Here came the old woman down the hill  --  there was always one . In tippets and tapping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sometimes it seemed to Eugene that all the women in San Franciscowere walking those hills all their lives , with canes before they knew it , and when they got old , instead of dying they used two canes , or crutches . Emma 's feet were dainty , but the round flesh came all the way down her legs like pantalettes . She said it had only been there since the birth of the child : she blamed little Fan with it . Out of the middle of her grief she could rise and put her unanswerable pink finger on Woman 's Sacrifice . " Your little girl , " Eugene remarked aloud , " said , Mama , my throat hurts me , ' and she was dead in three days . You expected her mother would watch a fever , while you were at the office , not go talk to Mrs. Herring . But you never spoke of it , did you . Never did . " Each rounded house contained a stair . Every form had its spiral or its tendril , outward or concealed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intricacies of those things ; sea gulls were sitting at their heads . How could he make a fire escape if he were required to ? The laddered , tricky fire escapes , the mesh of unguarded traffic , coiling springs , women'sp211lace , the nests in their purses  --  he thought how the making and doing of daily life mazed a man about , eyes , legs , ladders , feet , fingers , like a vine . It twined a man in , the very doing and dying and daring of the world , the citified world . He could not set about making a fire escape to his flat in Jones Street , given all the parts and the whole day off and the right instruments , if Mr. Bertsinger and Emma too told him to go ahead , and that his life depended on it . Should he be ashamed ? " Open the door , Richard . Ouvrez le f enetre , Paul ou Jacques , " the demoniac voice of the comedian sang on the record , and Eugene waited to hear it again . He remembered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Morgana knew when he was in trouble at home ; he walked into the store and asked them to play him a record- " Rocks in My Bed Number Two , " by Blind Boy Fuller . Through a basementwindow he saw an upright piano and a big colored woman plying the keys . She looked like a long way from home . He could not hear her , and realized that there was much noise outside here , in the streets . " I do n't get the sun in my eyes , " said a little boy , looking up at Eugene , who was holding one hand slanted before his face . " You do n't , sonnie ? " said Eugene gently . With one hand he took away the other , as if the little boy had asked him to stop using it . The boy gave him a sweet , cocksure smile , which jumped with many suns in Eugene 's vision . They were on a numbered avenue not far , now , from the ocean . Seasoned with light like old invalids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather unexpectedly lunged forward , swung his big body around , and gazed for himself at the world behind and below where they had come . He tenderly swept an arm . The whole arena was alight with a fairness and blueness at this hour of afternoon ; all the gray was blue and the white was blue  --  the laid-out city looked soft , brushed over with some sky- feather . Then he dropped his hand , as though the . city might retire ; and lifted it again , as though to bring it back for a second time . He was really wonderful , with his arm raised . They walked on , until the sky ahead was brilliant enough to keep the eyes dazzled . On the next hill two nuns in a sea of wind looked destructible as smokestacks on a flaming roof . " Chances are "  --  Eugene had begun speaking again  --  " you did n't know you had it in you  --  to strike a woman . Did you ? " The Spaniard threw him a dark glance . But it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guitar player " or " This is Presidio Avenue . " Calmly he set his steps over a sprawled old winehead sleeping up here far away from his kind . Quite unheeding of legs overhead , the sleeper was stretched out of a little garden with his head in the anemones and the gray beard shining like spittle on his face . " You would n't mind finding yourself like that , " Eugenesaid , walking in the Spaniard 's exact steps over the fallen legs . And Eugene felt all at once an emotion that visited him inexplicably at times  --  the overwhelming , secret tenderness toward his twin , Ran MacLain , whom he had not seen for half his life , that he might have felt toward a lover . Was all well with Ran ? How little we know ! For considering that he might have done some reprehensible thing , then he would need the gravest and tenderest handling . Eugene 's eyes nearly closed and he half fainted upon the body of the city , the old veins , the mottled skin of pavement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold his temples and put its eyes to his . He heard the murmuring slit of the cable track . The Spaniard was holding him by the arm . His large face overhead flowed over with commiseration and pleasure . As if he were saying , " Why , of course . This is what we came for ! " Eugene was half-liftedp213across the street . Then the Spaniard , still with a look of interest , made a gesture of examining him , patted him and straightened him up , gave him a little finishingshake , a cuff . And rain fell on them . In the air a fine , caressing ' precipitation " was shining . An open-eyed baby in his cart extended his little hands and held his thumbs and forefingers tight-shut : a hold on the bright mist . On the hill a cable car slid to a perch on the crest and sat there , home-like as a lawn swing , gay with girls ' and boys ' legs . Above , over cleared ground where a tree-cutting and excavation went on in the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky jumped at each other and nodded like gossips . A sea wind blew the scent of alyssum from all the waste spaces . It waved the wispy white beard of an old Chinese gentleman who was running with the abandon of a school child for the car , which waited on him . This hilltop wind passed over Eugene with the refreshment that sometimes comes of a gentle sloughing off of a daydream or desire which takes even its memory with it . He looked up at his Spaniardand drew a breath also , perhaps not really a sympatheticone , but he seemed to increase in size . Eugenewatched his great fatherly barrel of chest move , and had a momentary glimpse of his suspenders , which were pink trimmed in silver with little bearded animal faces on the buckles . His face with its expression that might be solicitude still  --  and at the same time , meditation , amusement , sleepiness , or implacability when the whole was seen at such close quarters with the black circles , the shell rims , around the eyes  --  was directed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with the long black hair bobbing behind , nodded a fraction at something . It struck Eugene that he looked like that Doctor Caligari in the old silent movie days , ringing his bell on the sideshow platform . For he had nodded up at the undestroyed part of the embankment , where some of the old graves , still to be ransacked by the shovels , stood here and there under the olive trees . In the foreground was a cat . In the deep grass she held a motionless and time-honoredpose . Her head was three-quarters turned toward them where they stood . It seemed to have womanly eyebrows . Her gaze came out of her face with the whole of animal comprehension ; whether it was menace or alarm in the full-open eyes , her face made a burningglassof looking . Her eyes seemed after so long a time to be holding her herself in their power . She crouched rigid with the devotion and intensity of her vision , and if she had caught fire there , still she could not , Eugene felt , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumed twice over before she disregardedeither what she was looking at or her own frenzy . On the untidy embankment something else  --  the object of the gaze  --  presently showed itself by a motion in the grass . As if the sight pricked him to move , Eugene darted for a heavy pine twig with cones and threw it at the cat ; it struck her side . She seemed not to feel it , since she did not waver . He exclaimed . And all the while the Spaniard was standing there in a relaxed posture looking on he might have been over in Paris , looking at the Seine ! And yet that detachment , Eugene was not unaware , and it gave him some bitterness , had been the outer semblance of what passion in his music last night ! Eugene watched stubbornly , and even felt his excitementgrow as the whirring of a wing or the pulsing of a tongue , whatever it was , came at less frequent intervals . It was still too rapid for the eye to tell what made it . Which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the lure , on its side , becomingan old thing , taken for granted ? This had a beginning and end . " What 's in the grass , a bird or a snake ? What do you bet ? " Eugene said softly  |p215But  the Spaniard stood patiently planted there , while the terrible gaze ran fast as a humming wire between the cat and the other creature . Did n't it matterwhich poor , avid life took the gaze and which gave it ? The cat 's eyes big as watches shone tearlessly . Eugenethought all at once , It 's all the same  --  it 's a bestialthing , all of it , I do n't care to know , thank you . But he waited . The next minute he threw a stone , this time in the direction of the fluttering in the grass . It excited him ; this , indeed , made the cat spit drily and tremble all over . The Spaniard , when Eugene looked to him , was making a hideous face over the lighting of another cigarette . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rippled once , then all cleared . His lips were grape-colored , and the smoke smelled sweet . " Come on , " Eugene said to him , and took his arm and pulled . " Come on , you Dago . " They had come down at the end to the beach : great emptiness . At first it seemed no one was there , so late on this uncertain day . Then crossing the middle distancetoward the sea appeared a student with his pants rolled up , reading as he walked , and a man , who looked like a hermit , rather gracefully shoulderingwood . Farther away still in the pale expanse two middle-aged ladies in steadily threatened hats materialized ; they looked at their watches : waiting for sunset . One battered , sand-colored auto was in sight ; it had been left by the sea wall gate , one door open , a horse 's bleached skull hanging on the face of the radiator . A little dog sat inside . Black smoke moved on the air , fading ; the day 's casual fires along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disclosed at sea . Some sea gulls perched on the roller-coaster humps , some stood short-necked and unmoving in front of the shuttered-down food stands , and the blackbirds like little ladies walked about at their feet , keeping busy . How could it have seemed so silent , because it was deserted ? Just the way it had seemed deserted , at first , because the noise had n't been taken in . There was actually a steady tinkling where the carousel went around , with no child riding , and there was the excitedand unrelieved sound of laughter filling the midway . Eugene knew its source and pointed it out to the Spaniard , who swayed each way and smiled faintly . The shouting mechanical dummy of a woman , larger than life , dressed up and with a feather in her hat , stood beckoning on the upper gallery of the House of Mirth and producing her wound-up laughter . In every way she called for the attention ; the motions of her head with its feather , and of her arms and hips , were as raucous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insides . The boom of the ocean seemed to be bearing that small sound , too , on its back , supporting this one extra little chip . Eugene walked down to the sands where the wind beat the laughter to pieces and the ripping sound of his own hat filled his ears . The Spaniard was already at the shore , facing the waves , and so immovably established that the esthetic ladies had withdrawn . Only a pair of lovers lay close by the wall  --  motionlessalso . His solid tracks in the sand were the only straight line on the beach , butting through wood gatherers ' , students ' , ladies ' , lovers ' , and all the vanishedchildren 's and dogs ' . Eugene 's now went around his , light and toeing out . Sea onions littered the beach ; what night had the storm been ? Now and then the crashing reach of water came to the European points of the other man 's shoes , advancing at the last instant with pure little tongues , that minutely kissed and withdrew . Eugene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beach to the cliffs there . " Land 's End ! " he shouted , while the waves ' sound drowned him out . He pulled gently.  |p217The  Spaniard looked affirmative , but first disengagedhimself and made water toward the sea , throwingup a rampart , a regular castle , in the sand . So they turned and their walk could still go on along shore , past the black pits of fires and the ubiquitous , ugly , naked sea onions , until they reached rocks ; then it led up to the overlooking wall . A little boy up there on a velocipede with his yellow hair blown in points came riding dreamily between the men , even he with a tied-on sea onion tail dragging six feet behind him . The Spaniard soberly bent over and gave the tail a carefree , lariat-like swing . The little boy looked back , eyes and mouth all round , and the next instant screamed with delighted outrage , as if he saw himself mocked . Beyond the car barn was a black scraggly wood , and then there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or once there had been . For there had been an occasion when Eugene and Emma had come this far , and picnicked here . They had drunk several bottles of red wine and gone to sleep in the hot sun on the rocks , lying on their backs , knees up , heads tipped together . Emma ' s fair skin had turned pink as a rose . Where was little Fan then ? That had n't bothered them that day . The men walked and climbed along this road with the sea exploding straight under them at times  --  no beach now , only the brown rocks . From time to time another rock would move a little , or there would be a little rain of pebbly sound somewhere . Occasional paths wandered off down the sharp slopes through grass or over the bare rock to the boulders at the water 's edge . The little bushes whipped , and the Spaniard 's black coat leaped and danced . Eugene felt the Pacific wind like a fortification , he could storm it or lean onto it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep him from falling too . It blew the sea gulls back . A flock of them , collectedpoints of light halfway up the sky , made a turn all at one time , and showed the facets of their flight clear as a diamond . Eugene sucked in the air  --  now it was rapture . He watched the birds fly out , blow back . ( Down at the wharf , down out of the high heavens , they stood solid as housewives , one large plump one to each little fishing boat , almost moral-looking , ready to pronounce judgment . It seemed sometimes that all sea gulls could not be the same , that they must be two varieties of birdkind , or the birds themselves must have two lives . Was it the sun or the fog , the time of day , that most often changed things , by changing their appearances ? He supposed he had a horror of closed-in places and of being shut in , but in late afternoon he had seen Alcatraz light as a lady 's hat afloat on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go to that island himself , and say to people , " Convicts are Christ , " or the like . ) " Will you go in front , or behind ? " he asked , but the Spaniard was already going in front . " You know what you did , " Eugene said . " You assaultedyour wife . Do you say you did n't know you had it in you ? " The Spaniard up ahead made his way forward without turning around . By now the path had grown wild and narrow ; it made slow going , or rather , the Spaniard 's leisurely gaining of the cliff set the pace , not Eugene 's backslidings and precarious scramblings . All the while , as if they were borne independently of legs of any kind beneath , the heads of the two men kept turning calmly outward , eyes traveling over the view . But as if to mock that too , once the Spaniard'shands met on top of his head to clamp his hat , his elbows bent outward . It was the lumpy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The deepening sky was divided in half as it often was at this hour , by a kind of spinal cloud . Ahead , the north was clear and the south behind was thickenedwith white . Under the clear portion of sky thep219sea rushed in dark to greenness and blackness , the lips of the waves livid . ( " Flounder , flounder in the sea , " he heard his mother read . ) Under the cloudy portion the sea burned silver and at moments entirely white , and the waves coming in held their form until the last minute and appeared still and limitless as snow . The beach and the city where they had walked were crossed with dust and mist , the scene flickered like the banners and flying sand of distant battle or a tumult in the past . Ahead , the extending rocks were unqualifiedly clear , hard , and azure . The steepness increased , the path after a certain point appeared entirely out of use . Here and there a boulder had lately fallen and lay in their path wet within its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they had to climb around it , holding to brush . Where there were not rocks it was sandy and grassy and very wild . A fault of course lay all through the land . Sometimes Eugene was aware that he jerked like a pigeon or rocked like a sailor , going down , or sagged like an old poodle , going up ; it was all the same . Once he leaped , and almost without a care . His tiltings , projections , slidings , working to keep up , all were painless now , and a progress he kept to himself . When pain did not hurt , and the world did , things had got very strange  --  different . The sun was low , and some of the fog bank had detached itself in narrow clouds thin and delicate as bone , with the red light beginning to come through . The Spaniard went as sedately as ever along the edge he walked ; had he been here before too ? When he jumped on his slick black shoes , his footing was sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the choice was always a clever and difficult one . Paths ran everywhere now , a network of threads over waste and rock , with dancing , graybeard bushes to hold to . Below , the wet boulders were now faintly covered with light . Bathers in the distance , or porpoises , rose and sank sky-colored ; there are always strangers who swim at sunset time . Eugene went where the Spaniard went , but not always everywhere he went . There were caves where the paths dropped to the sea , and the Spaniard went on his own to inspect them . Eugene ceased crying directions , for it made him feel like a lost lamb bleating . The huge fellow let himself down the steep rocks and with hands and knees peered into the caves , like a dentist into alluring mouths . Rats ran up the bald surfaces . They were big rats  --  a size not of any habitation anywhere but of away out here , of unvisitedgeographical parts  --  as the world 's wild dogs and wild horses are unseen and sizeless . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one side . Even he could not light his cigarettes in this wind . As it grew later the men made their way on , and piercing the sound of the wind the little dark birds that lived for neatness about the edge of the sea began to fill the air with twitterings , like birds ready to nest in leafy trees in a little springtime town . There had evidently been , without their knowing it , a loss of the wish to go back . Perhaps this wish had expired . Eugene , who had once nearly drowned , remembered his discovery of the death of volition to stay up in the water . Such things were always found out no telling how long after it was too late . The sun was dropping . It looked wetter than water , then not so much a bright body as a red body . It dropped and was gone in the blue mist that was coming in over the sea . For a brief period the water , brighter than air , turned smooth and calm and the fog with wings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face . " You heard me , all the time , " he said . But the Spaniard bent over with his back to Eugene , and was peering at some blotched wild lilies that grew in the coarse grass there . He touched thep221tips of his fingers deliberately under the soft pale petals and examined their hairy hearts . Eugene was waiting behind him as he turned with a flower in his hand . All at once the Spanish eyes looked wide awake , and the man smiled like someone waking from a deep dream , the sleep of a month . He put up his little flower , and regarded it . " Mariposa , he said , making each syllable clearly distinct . He held up the little wild waving spotted thing , the common mariposa lily . " Mariposa ? " He repeated the word encouragingly , even sweetly , makingthe sound of it beautiful . " You assaulted your wife , " Eugene said loudly . The Spaniard still held his eyes open wide . If the staring smile was a slight , at the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your heart , " Eugene said , and then he was lost . It was a lifelong trouble , he had never been able to express himself at all when it came to the very moment . And now , on a cliff , in a wind , to .. . Eugene thrust both hands forward and took hold of the other man , not half compassing the vast waist . But he recognized the weight that was so light on its feet , and he had only to make one move more , to unsettle that weight and let it go . Under his watchful eyes the flower went out of the other 's loosening , softeninghand : it lay on the wind , and sank . One more move and the man would go too , drop out of sight . He would go down below and it took only a touch . Eugene clung to the Spaniard now , almost as if he had waited for him a long time with longing , almost as if he loved him , and had found a lasting refuge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the great pores in the loose , hanging cheek . The Spaniard closed his eyes . Then a bullish roar opened out of him . He wagged his enormous head . What seemed to be utterances of the wildest order came from the wide mouth , together with the dinner 's old reek . Eugene half expectedmore bones . He could see everything more than plainly . The Spaniard 's eyes also were open to the widest , and his nostrils had the hairs raised erect in them . Eugene suddenly lost his balance and nearly fell , so that he had to pull himself back by helplessly seizinghold of the big man . He listened on , perforce , to the voice that did not stop . It was a terrible recital . Eugene drew back as far as possible and presently began to glare at him  --  a man laying himself altogether bare like that , with no shame , no respect . . . . What was he digging up to confess to , making such a spectacle ? To whom did he think he prayed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while his ears were beaten upon , his whole body , indeed . Abruptly  --  and causing silence as with a stopper  --  the Spaniard 's broad-brimmed hat shot up in the wind and was blown  --  to sea ? Landward . Eugene felt compelled to : he let go the Spaniard and ran hurrying to catch the hat and bring it back . Now it lifted ahead , turned over , clung to a wall , flew up again . Eugene had to climb a rather difficult part of the cliff . He saw the hat , and reached it where it danced about a bush , and got it in his hand . Eugene lost his own hat in the chase ; but inspirationwas with him now , and he put on the Spaniard 's . Knees bent on the pinnacle , raincoat whipping , he reached up and set it on his head . It stayed on , and at the same time it shadowed him . The band inside was warm and fragrant still . Elation ran all through his body , like the first runner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaking with extreme care , as particularlyas if he could see himself again in Emma 's mirror with the little snapshot stuck in the corner , he set the brim just so . He returned over the rocks and placed himself and looked back at the other man , eyes protected . It was in all confidence that he took fresh hold of him , but this time  --  how cruell  --  he could not move him . He could not budge him an inch . He stood there withp223his hands in appeal on the Spaniard 's silent arms . But this time the Spaniard had hold of him . It was a hold of hard , callused fingers like prongs . And the Spaniard would have looked small down there , all the way down below . Suppose there were a little guitar , no bigger than a watch . Eugene stood waiting there as if he listened to sirens . Then within himself he felt a strange sensation , strange in itself but , alas , he recognized it . He had felt it before  --  always before when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , with Emma asleep beside him . Something round would be in his mouth . But its size was the thing that was strange . It was as if he were trying to swallow a cherry but found he was only the size of the stem of the cherry . His mouth received and was explored by some immensity . It became more and more immense while he waited . All knowledge of the rest of his body and the feeling in it would leave him ; he would not find it possible to describe his position in the bed , where his legs were or his hands ; his mouth alone felt and it felt enormity . Only the finest , frailest thread of his own body seemed to exist , in order to provide the mouth . He seemed to have the world on his tongue . And it had no taste  --  only size . He held onto the Spaniard and once more , feebly , with an arm or a leg , he tried to move him , to break away . The fog flowed into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeated , an uncertain distance away . Eugene heard , then by chance saw , a man and girl moving along by their own light , a flashlight , skirting the brink just above , ahead of the night falling . They circled near . He heard them laugh , and in the dusk he flung back his head and could look up into the gleam of their teeth  --  was that happiness ? Teeth bared like the rats ' , the same as in hunger or stress ? As he gasped , the sweet and the salt , the alyssum and the sea affected him as a single scent . It lulled him slightly , blurring the moment . The now calming ocean , the pounding of a thousand gentlenesses , went on into darkness and obscurity . He felt himself lifted up in the strong arms of the Spaniard , up above the bare head of the other man . Now the second hat blew away from him too . He was without a burden in the world . Pillowed on great strength , he was turned in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad that circlingin his mind the daylong foreboding had to return , that he had yet to open the door and climb the stairs to Emma . There she waited in the front room , shedding her tears standing up , like a bride , with the white curtains of the bay window hanging heavy all around her . When his body was wheeled another turn , the forebodinglike a spinning ball was caught again . This time the vision  --  some niche of clarity , some future  --  was Emma MacLain turning around and coming part way to meet him on the stairs . Still like a rumble , her light and young-like tread , that could cause his whole body to be shaken with tenderness and mystery , crossed the floor . She lifted both arms in the wide , aroused sleeves and brought them together around him . He had to sink upon the frail hall chair intended for the coats and hats . And she was sinking upon him and on his mouth putting kisses like blows , returning him awesome favors in full vigor , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could have spoken ! It was out of this relentlessness , not out of the gush of tears , that there would be a child again . Could it be possible that everythingnow could wait ? If he could have stopped everything , until that pulse , far back , far inside , far within now , could shake like the little hard red fist of the first spring leaf ! He was brought over and held by the knees in the posture of a bird , his body almost upright and his forearms gently spread . In his nostrils and relaxing eyes and around his naked head he could feel the reach of fine spray or the breath of fog . He was up/borne , open-armed . He was only thinking , My dear love comes . He heard a loud , emotional cry  --  a bellow  --  from some other throat than his own , and heard it sink to the deepest rumbling . That was his Spaniard . And the next moment " Oh , is he going to throw him over ? " a feminine voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were coming , on a lower road . " Are n't you ashamed of yourself , teasing a little fellow like that , scaring him ? " the girl 's voice continued . " Put him down and pick up one your own size , or Billy will teach you . " Then , or even before then , Eugene was lowered and set down again . His dangling heels , one of which had gone to sleep , kicked at the rock and then his feet stood on it . In the purple of night there was struck a little pasteboard match . Two big common , toothy sweethearts stood there in its light , and the next moment vanished in the fog looking pleased with each other . The mask face of the Spaniard , with hair swirling about it , was left shining there by matchlight . It turned one way and the other , looked up and down . It exuded sweat . So now , the Spaniard took hold of Eugene 's arm and guided him carefully by the instant 's light of one match after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moon . The world was not dark , but pale . The mist flowed from their fingers and rolled behind their heels . They looked together for the thread of the way back . They seized hands at perilous places and took mistaken hold of streaming thorn bushes with a chorus of outcries . They retreatedat points and tried the way again . They both jumped at scuttling sounds , though the Spaniardmade some inimitable Spanish noise that sounded as though it might have , before now , madeP226rats go back . When was it they came to the easy part of the path , then to the road ? Next , the whole sound of the sea faded behind the windbreak of trees , which in the wet fog smelled of black pepper . When the trees opened out and they reached pavement , some city corner and its streetlight , they were so cold it was foregone they should go in the nearest cafe for coffee . Eugene pulled away , combed back his hair , and led the way now . " Two coffees ! " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the counter . It was warm here . The Spaniard began to smoke , and sat with eyes shut , even when the waitress came out . Large , middle-aged , big-boned , she moved up in a loose , grand style . Her face was large . All her featureswere made to seem bigger than life by paint , a pinkish mouth painted over her real mouth , eyebrowsput on with brown grease in bands half an inch wide with perfect curves . Her eyes were small , so that with the mascara and the shadows painted on their lids they looked like flopping black butterflies . She had hennaed hair , somewhat greasy . She wore jewelry worth about eleven dollars and a quarterall together , Eugene saw  --  hoops of gold in her ears , a lavalier around her neck , four bracelets , and rings on both hands . There on her one body the illusionsof gold , of silver , and of diamonds were all gone . " One coffee with milk , " Eugene said to her , " one black , " and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  soliloquy , and with an accent . " Meelk , meelk , there is one who wants meelk , " she said , striding up and down behind the counter but not going away or looking at her customers or consulting further . " And pastry . " " Oh , no . Pastry is no more . " She had a resonant ,  |p229this  morning , " Mrs. Herring offered , " that needed a haircut . He was next to a woman and he was laughing with her out loud  --  bad taste , we thought . It was before service began , it 's true . He laughed first and then slapped her leg , there in Peter and Paul directly in front of me home from my trip . " Eugene tilted back in his chair , and watched Emma pop the grapes in . " That would be him , " said Emma.  | " How come you were n't here yesterday ? " old Mrs. Stark asked her maid , looking up from her solitaire board  --  inlaid wood that gave off pistol-like reports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Septemberand here in the hall she imagined she could feel October at her back . " I didn ' get back from my sisters ' in the country . " " And poor Miss Katie Rainey dead . What were you so busy doing ? " " Showin ' my teef . " Mrs. Stark raised her voice . " Only thing I can do for people any more , in joy or sorrow , is send ' em you . You know how Miss Jinny and Mr. Ran back out on me , then you go off . Now it 's here next day . Fix my breakfast and yours and go on down there . Get in the kitchen and clean it up for Miss Virgie , do n't pay any attention to her . Take that ham we have n't sliced into . Start cooking for the funeral , if others did n't beat you to it yesterday . " " Yes 'm . " " Mind you learn to appreciate your good kitchen when you stand over a wood stove all day . " " I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you get to it  --  hard time gettin ' out . " Mrs. Stark snapped her fingers . " You and all your sisters ! " She rose and walked , with her walk like a girl 's , to the front door , looking down over her hill , the burned , patchy grass no better than Katiep231Rainey 's , and the thirsty shrubs ; but the Morgan sweet olive , her own grandmother 's age , her grandmother 's tree , was blooming . She murmured over her shoulder , " I never had cause to set foot in the Rainey house for over five minutes in my life . And I do n't suppose they need me now . But I hope I know what any old woman owes another old woman . It does n't matter if it 's too late . Do you hear me ? Go back and put on a clean apron . " The Raineys , Miss Katie and her daughter Virgie , still held on to the house beyond the pavement , on the MacLain Road . There on the ridge the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privet , gone to trees , that edged the porch . The cannas with their scorched edges , together with the well , made the three familiar islands in the whitened grass of the yard . Across and back again , with effort but bobbinlike , had moved Miss Katie , Mrs. Fate Rainey , in her dress the hard blue of a morning-glory . In old age Miss Katie showed what a neat , narrow head she had under the hair no longer disheveled and flyaway . When she came outdoors , her carefully dressed and carefully held head was as silver-lookingas a new mail box . It was out of the autocracy of her stroke  --  she had suffered " a light stroke " five years ago , " while separating my cows and calves , " she would recount it that she 'd begun ordering things done by set times . When it was time for Virgie to come home from work in the afternoon , Miss Katie fretted herself for fear she would n't be in time to milk before dark . She still had her two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front yard , or moved the best way she could back and forth , waiting for Virgie . A fiery streak of salvia that ran around the side of the house would turn darker in the leveling light . Though the shade broadened , she still walked her narrow path , not yielding even to the kind sun . She held up poorly there , propped by an old thornstick.  | Bleaching down by the roadside was a chair , an old chair she sold things from once , under the borrowed shade of the chinaberry across the road ; but she did n't seem to want to sit down any more , or to be quite that near the trafficking . Clear up where she was , she felt the world tremble ; day and night the loggers went by , to and from Morgan 's Woods . That wore . her out too . While she lived , she was going to wait and she did wait , standing up  --  until Virgie her daughter , past forty now and too dressed up , came home to milk Bossy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very people that were out depleting the woods , Mr. Nesbitt 's company . Miss Katie could n't spare her good hand to put up and shade her eyes ; yet after you passed , you saw her in that position , in your vision if not in your sight . She looked ready to ward you off , too , in case of pity , there in her gathered old-lady dress , sometimes in an old bonnety church-hat . There 's the old lady that watches the turn of the road , thought the old countrymen , Sissums and Sojourners and Holifields , passing in trucks or wagons on Saturday , going home , lifting their hats . Young courting people , LittleSister Spights ' crowd , giggled at her , but small children and Negroes did not ; they took her for granted like the lady on the Old Dutch Cleanser can . The old people in Morgana she reminded of SnowdieMacLain , her neighbor once , who watched and waited for her husband so long . They were reminded vaguely of themselves , too , now that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting for something they did n't really know about any longer , would n't recognize to see it coming in the road . As she looked out from her hill in the creeping shade , Miss Katie Rainey might have liked to be argued with and prevailed upon to go back in the house ; at the last she might have suffered contradiction , but from whom ? Not from Virgie . " Where 's my girl ? Have you seen my girl ? "  |p233Miss  Katie thought she called to the road , but she did n't ; shame drew down her head , for she could still feel one thing if she could feel little else coming to her from the outside world : lack of chivalry . Waiting , she heard circling her ears like the swallowsbeginning , talk about lovers . Circle by circle it twittered , church talk , talk in the store and post office , vulgar man talk possibly in the barbershop . Talk she could never get near now was coming to her . " So long as the old lady 's alive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't run off and leave her , she 's old and crippled . " " Left once , will again . " " That fellow Mabry 's been taking out his gun and leaving Virgie a bag o ' quail every other day . Anybodycan see him go by the back door . " " I declare . " " He told her the day she got tired o ' quail , let him know and he 'd quit and go on off , that 's what I heard . " " Do tell . " " Furthermore , I reckon it would be possible for a human being , a woman , to live off them rich birds for the remaining space of time . Her ma can help her eat ' em . Her ma ai n't lost her appetite ! " " Hush . " " Guess it would n't be polite for her or him neither one to stop on the quails . Even if he heard . Got to keep on now . " " Oh , sure . Fate Rainey 's a clean shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Not Fate Rainey at all ; but Mr. Mabry . It was just that the talk Miss Katie heard was in voices of her girlhood , and some times they slipped . Then , in an odd set way , for she lied badly , she would lie to Virgie when she came . " I asked Passing . And not one of ' em said they could tell me where you were , what kept you so long in town . "  | But it 's my last summer , and she ought to get back here and milk on time , the old lady thought , stubbornlyand yet pityingly , the two ways she was . " Look where the sun is , " she called , as Virgie did drive up in the yard in the old coupe Miss Katie kept forgetting she had , the battered thing she took in trade for the poor little calf . " I see it , Mama . " Virgie 's long , dark , too heavy hair swung this way and that as she came up in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bearded grass . " You have to milk before dark , after driving them in , and there 's four little quails full of shot for you to dress , lying on my kitchen table . " " Come on back in the house , Mama . Come in with me . " " I been by myself all day . " Virgie bent and gave her mother her evening kiss . Miss Katie knew then that Virgie would drive the cows home and milk and feed them and deliver the milk on the road , and come back and cook the little quails . " It 's a wonder , though , " she thought . " A blessed wonder to see the child mind . " The day Miss Katie died , Virgie was kneeling on the floor of her bedroom cutting out a dress from some plaid material . She was sewing on Sunday . " There 's nothing Virgie Rainey loves better than struggling against a real hard plaid , " Miss Katie thought , with a thrust of pain from somewhere unexpected . Whereas , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dividing it in half ; there should be one in every woman 's body  --  it would need to be the long way , not the cross way  --  that was too easy  --  making each of them a side to feel and know , and a side to stop it , to be waited on , finally . But she wanted to drop to her knees there where Virgie 's plaid spread out like a pretty rug for her.  |p235Her  last clear feeling as she stood there , holding herselfup , was that she wanted to be down and covered up , in , of all things , Virgie 's hard-to-match-up plaid . But she turned herself around by an act of strength which tore her within and walked , striking her cane , the width of the hall and two rooms and lay down on her own bed . " Stop and fan me a minute , " she called aloud . She was thinking rapidly to herself , though , that Virgie had said , " I aim to get married on my bulb money . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with pins in her mouth and her thumb marked green from the scissors , and stood over her . She brought a paper up and down over her mother 's face . She fanned her with the Market Bulletin . Dying , Miss Katie went rapidly over the list in it , her list . As though her impatient foot would stamp at each item , she counted it , corrected it , and yet she was about to forget the seasons , and the places things grew . Purple althea cuttings , true box , four colors of cannas for fifteen cents , moonvine seed by teaspoonful , green and purple jew . Roses : big white rose , little thorn rose , beauty-red sister rose , pink monthly , old-fashioned red summer rose , very fragrant , baby rose . Five colors of verbena , candlestick lilies , milk and wine lilies , blackberry lilies , lemon lilies , angel lilies , apostle lilies . Angel trumpet seed . The red amarylis . Faster and faster , Mrs. Rainey thought : Red salvia , four-o'clock , pink Jacob 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grass , century plants , vase palm , watermelon pink and white crape myrtle , Christmas cactus , golden bell . White Star Jessamine . Snowball . Hyacinthus . Pink fairy lilies . White . The fairy white . " Fan me . If you stop fanning , it 's worse than if you never started . " And when Mama is gone , almost gone now , she meditated , I can tack on to my ad : the quilts ! For sale , Double Muscadine Hulls , Road to Dublin , Starry Sky , Strange Spider Web , Hands All Around , Double Wedding Ring . Mama 's rich in quilts , child . Miss Katie lay there , carelessly on the counterpane , thinking , Crochet tablecloth , Sunburst design , very lacy . She knew Virgie stood over her , fanning her in rhythmic sweeps . Presently Miss Katie 's lips shut tight . She was thinking , Mistake . Never Virgie at all . It was me , the bride  --  with more than they guessed . Why , Virgie , go away , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what happened to it , her protest . Virgie knelt , crouched there . She held her head , her mouth opened , and one by one the pins fell out on the floor . She was not much afraid of death , either of its delay or its surprise . As yet nothing in the place of fear came into her head ; only something about her dress . The bed , the headboard dark and ungiving as an old mirror on the wall , to her as a child a vast King Arthur shield that might have concealed a motto , cast its afternoon shadow down dark as muscadines , to her mother 's waist . The old shadow , familiar as sleep the life long , always ran down over the bolster this time of year , the warm and knotty medallions of the familiar counterpane  --  the overworked , inherited , and personal pattern  --  from which her mother 's black shoes now pointed up . Behind the bed the window was full of cloudy , pressing flowers and leaves in heavy light , like a jar of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fed , darted . Every day he came . He had a ruby throat . The clock jangled faintly as cymbals struck under water , but did not strike ; it could n't . Yet a torrent of riches seemed to flow over the room , submerging it , loading it with what was over-sweet . Virgie ran to the porch . Waiting on a passing Negro , she called , in a moment , " Go get me Dr.P237Loomis out of church ! " The Negro began to sprint in his Sunday clothes . By mid-afternoon the house was filling with callers and helpers . Each one who came seemed stopped by the enormous dead boxwood , like a yellow sponge , that stood by the steps ; it had to be gone around . Coffee was being kept on the stove and iced tea in the pitcher in the hall . Virgie was dressed , in the dress she had ironed that morning for Monday , and at the front of the house . Moving around her , a lady watered the ferns and evened the shades in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if some obscuresums were being balanced and checked . Every seat in the parlor and Virgie 's room was taken , the porch and the steps creaked under the men who stood outside . Cassie Morrison , her black-stockinged legs seeming to wade among the impeding legs of the other women , crossed the parlor to where Virgie sat in the chair at the closed sewing machine . Cassie had chosen the one thin , gold-rimmed coffee cup for herself , and balanced it serenely . " Papa sent his sympathy . Let me sit by you , Virgie . " She kissed her . " You know I know what it 's like . " " Excuse me , Virgie was saying . All at once she slept , straight in the cane chair . When she opened her eyes , she watched and listened to the even fuller roomful as carefully , and as carelessly , as vacillating as though she were on the point of departure . Through their murmur she heard herself circle the room to speak to them and be kissed . She made the steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breasts , and hips in their helpless agitation , like a rope of bells she started in their ears . " She ca n't help it , " Cassie Morrison was saying to the person beside her in the gentle tones of a verdict . " She ca n't take in what 's happened quite yet and she does n't really know us . " The unnaturally closed door led from Miss Katie's room out to the parlor . Behind it , they all knew  --  waiting as they were for it to open  --  Miss Snowdie MacLain was laying Miss Katie out . She washed and dressed her herself , tolerating only two old Loomis Negroes to wait on her , and Miss Snowdie was nearly seventy too , and had come seven miles from MacLain . There was something about it nobody liked , perhaps a break in custom . Miss Lizzie Stark , whose place they felt it to be to supervise the house while old Miss Emmy Holifield laid out the dead , had felt too weak today , and sent word she had had to lie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was true that none of the callers except Miss Snowdie had been inside the Rainey house since Mr. Fate Rainey 's funeral . No wonder Virgie looked at them now , staring , at moments . Always in a house of death , Virgie was thinking , all the stories come evident , show forth from the person , become a part of the public domain . Not the dead 's story , but the living 's . She could see Ran MacLain , standing at the door shaking hands with Mr. Nesbitt who was coming in . And did n't it show on Ran , that once he had taken advantage of a country girl who had died a suicide ? It showed at election time as it showed now , and he won the election for mayor over Mr. Carmichael , for all was remembered in his middle-age when he stood on the platform . Ran was smiling  --  holding on to a countryman now . They had voted for him for that for his glamour and his story , for being a MacLainand the bad twin , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thing she did . Old Man Moody found her on the floor of his store  --  the place she worked  --  and walked out into the street with her in his arms . They voted for the revelation ; it had made their hearts faint , and they would assert it again . Ran knew that every minute , there in the door he stood it . " Cheer up , now , cheer up , " Mr. Nesbitt was saying to her , seeming to lift her to her feet by runningp239his finger under her chin . His eyes  --  so willed by him , she thought ran tears and dried . " Come here , " he called over his shoulder . " Virgie , tell Mr. Thisbee who 's your best friend in this town . " He had brought the new man in the company . " You , Mr. Bitts , " Virgie said . " Everybody in Morgana calls me Mr. Bitts , Thisbee ; you can too . Now wait . Tell him who hired you when nobody else was in the hiring mood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you and stood up for you . " She never turned away until it was finished ; today this seemed somehow brief and easy , a relief . " Hurry up , Virgie . Got to cheer my daughter up next . " Nina Carmichael , Mrs. junior Nesbitt heavy with child , was seated where he could see her , head fine and indifferent , one puffed white arm stretched along the sewing machine . He winked at her across the room . " You , Mr. Bitts . " " Tell him how long you 've been working for old Mr. Bitts . " " A long time . " " No , tell him how long it 's been  --  my my my , tell him . I 've been in three different businesses , Thisbee . How long ? " " Since 1920 , Mr. Bitts . " " And if you ever made any mistakes in your letters and figgers , who was it stood behind you with the company ? " " I 'm very sorry for you in your sorrow , " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell . " But who ? Who stood behind you ? " Mr. Nesbitt extended his arms overly wide , as he did when asking her to dance with him in Vicksburg . Abruptly he wheeled and went off ; he was hurt , dis . appointed in her for the hundredth time . She saw Mr. Nesbitt 's fat , hurt back as he wandered as if lost and stood a long time contemplating and cheering up Nina Carmichael . Food  --  two banana cakes and a baked ham , a platterof darkly deviled eggs , new rolls  --  and flowers kept arriving at the back , and the kitchen filled with women as the parlor now filled with men come fartherin . Virgie went back once more to the kitchen , but again the women stopped what they were doing and looked at her as though something  --  not only today  --  should prevent her from knowing at all how to cook  --  the thing they knew . She went to the stove , took a fork , and turned over a piece or two of the chicken , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a kind of wonder and belligerence . Then she walked through them and stood on the quiet back porch to feel the South breeze . The packed freezer , wrapped in a croker sack , the old , golden stopper of newspaper hidden and waiting on tomorrow , stood in the dishpan . The cut flowers were plunged stem-down and head-down in shady water buckets . Virgie had a sudden recollection of recital night at Miss Eckhart 's  --  the moment when she was to be called out . She was thirteen , waiting outside , on guard at a vast calming spectacle of turmoil , and saving it . A little drop spilled , she remembered it now : an anxiety which brought her to the point of sickness , that back in there they were laughing at her mother 's hat . She went back into the parlor . Like a forest murmurthe waiting talk filled the room . The door opened . Miss Snowdie stood against it , sideways , looking neither in nor out . Immediately the ladies rose and filled the doorway ; some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Miss Katie 's feet could be seen from within the parlor . There were soft cries . " Snowdie ! " " Miss Snowdie ! She looks beautiful ! " Then the rest of the ladies tiptoed forward and could be seen bendingp241over the bed as they would bend over the cab of a little kicking baby . They came out again . " Come see your mother . " They pulled pre-emptorily at Virgie 's arms , their voices bright . " Do n't touch me . " They pulled harder , still smiling but in silence , and Virgie pulled back . Her hair fell over her eyes . She shook it back . " Do n't touch me . " " Honey , you just do n't know what you lost , that 's all . " They were all people who had never touched her before who tried now to struggle with her , their faces hurt . She was hurting them all , shocking them . They leaned over her , agonized , pleading with the pull of their hands . It was a Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last breath of her husband in a toy balloon , by his wish , and had it at home still  --  most of it , until a Negro stole it . Miss Perdita Mayo 's red face looked over their wall . " Your mama was too fine for you , Virgie , too fine . That was always the trouble between you . " In that truth , Virgie looked up at them lightheadedlyand they lifted her to her feet and drew her into the bedroom and showed her her mother . She lay in the black satin . It had been lifted , heavy as a child , out of her trunk , the dress in which diminished , pea-sized mothballs had shone and rolled like crystals all Virgie 's life , in waiting , taken out twice , and now spread out in full triangle . Her head was in the center of the bolster , the widow 's place in which she herself laid it . Miss Snowdie had rouged her cheeks . They watched Virgie , but Virgie gave them no sign now . She felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from her body and then give it a little shove forward , even their hands showing sorrow for a body that did not fall , giving back to hands what was broken , to pick up , smooth again .   For people 's very touch anticipated the falling of the body , the own , the single and watchful body . Later , back in the parlor , she cried . They said , " She used to set out yonder and sell muscadines , see out there ? There 's where she got rid of all her plums , the early and late , blackberries and dewberries , and the little peanuts you boil . Now the road goes the wrong way . " Though that was like a sad song , it was not true : the road still went the same , from Morgana to MacLain , from Morgana to Vicksburg and Jackson , of course . Only now the wrong people went by on it . They were all riding trucks , very fast or heavily loaded , and carrying blades and chains , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not eaters of muscadines , and did not stop to pass words on the season and what grew . And the vines had dried . She wept because they could not tell it right , and they did n't press for her reasons . " Call Mr. Mabry now . She 's let loose . " Mr. Mabry , fresh from the barbershop , took Virgie'shands and swung them , then dropped them . She dried her eyes instantly and withdrew , giving him permission to go into the other room . She wonderedwhen she had seen him leave her on tiptoe before . Old country fellows in the hall began to speak of him now , respectfully , as he looked down at the dead with his face so rubylike , so recently complimentedupon , that in the next moment it would fill with concern for itself . " He aims to get closer to Ives . Where he do n't have to use hoot owls for roosters and fox for yard dogs , is the way he put it to me . " " Then why on earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than right here , ' s what I think , if I wanted to be close in . " " He prefers Ives . " " I see . " But in the parlor it was generally felt polite now to consider Miss Katie as the center of conversation , since the door was now open .   " Virgie might get a little bit of dairyfood savings now , bet she 'll spend it on something ' sides the house , hm ? " A lady Virgie could n't place said it halfway in her direction , leaning toward her now and then as she had been doing , with her full weight . " Her pretty quilts , she ca n't ship those to the Fair no more . What does Virgie care about housekeeping and china plates without no husband , hm ? Wonder what Virgie 'll do with the chickens , Katie always enjoyed a mixed yard . Wonder who Virgie 'll give the deer to if she do n't want it . That picture of the deer Miss Katie 's mother hooked in Tishomingo with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Miss Katie considered it the prettiest thing in the world . The cloth doll with the china head and hands , that she used to let any and all play with  --  " " Guinevere ! Oh , I wish I had her now ! " Cassie Morrisonheld out both gloved hands . " Her fern stand . Virgie wo n't stay here to keep care of ferns , I bet . Her begonia , thirty-five years old . Not much older than Virgie , is it , Virgie ? She left her recipesto the Methodist Church  --  I hope . " " She was a living saint , " answered another lady , as if this would agree with everything . " Look at my diamond . " Jinny MacLain , Ran 's wife , was coming in . With her hand out , she showed a ring about the room on her way to Virgie . " I deserved me a diamond , " she went on to say to Cassie Morrison , twisting her hand on its wrist . " That 's what I told Ran . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's cheek , whispering , " I do n't have to see her  --  do I , Virgie ? " Then they all rose as Miss Snowdie came in . " I do n't have to see anybody ! " whispered Jinny fiercely . Virgie , still holding a cup of coffee , walked out and waited on the porch , for she knew Miss Snowdie would come outside . She could hear her in the parlor now , staying to take a certain amount of praise . Then Miss Snowdie came out , now as at all times a gentle lady , her face white and graciously folded , gently concerned but no more . She stood and looked out , at once shading her eyes , to the house across the road where she used to live . She kissed Virgie then , almost idly . " I think she looks all right , Virgie . " Her albino 's hands were cruelly reddened . But she never seemed really to feel their redness any more . Her soft black-and-white dotted dress smelled as freshly as always of verbena @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how . If Emmy Holifieldwere still living , she might have thought of things I did n't . " But her eyes went past Virgie , across the road , where the old house was a ruin now . In between where the women were standing and the sight of the old place , in the Rainey yard , the children waiting for their parents stood still , fell still , at that moment , and not knowing where to look all at once , listened  --  listened to the locusts , perforce , which sounded like the sound of the world going around to them as they suddenly beat their cupped hands over their ears . " Virgie ? You know Lizzie Stark and I long ago made up . About Ran and Jinny 's trouble ; that 's over , all over . But do you reckon , at such a time , it was old feelings rising up that kept her away ? " Miss Snowdie sighed , as if she had forgotten her question with the asking , as if a reply would interrupther . Across there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the old deserted time , when Virgie played with Ran and Eugene under her trees , on her porch , under her house , along the river bank , and in Morgan 's woods . There were leggy cedars still liningthe old property , their trunks white and knobbed like chicken bones . The old summer-house was still back there , lattices leaning inward and not matching at the joinings , in the shadow like a place where long ago something had been kept that could peep out now ; in the sun like a little temple raised to it . The big chinaberry tree had been cut down with the otherP245lawn trees when the house burned , but its many suckerssprayed up from the stump like a fountain . Negroes had carried away most of the sides and roof that remained of the house , but had hardly made inroad on the chimney , surprisingly enough ; it was its full height still , visible from here , dove-pink through the dust and leafiness . Little locusts and castorplants tall as a man had come up all around , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as old giants holding twilit , flimsy little flowers up high . Vines had taken the yard and the walk , the brick cross of the foundation , and the trees and all . Virgie removed herself from Miss Snowdie 's arm which had gone around her waist . The two women stood quiet in the afternoon light . " I said I 'd want her to lay me out , " the old lady said . She trembled very slightly but did not go back . She looked out still . From around the big boxwood Mr. King MacLain , treading so lightly they did n't hear him , came up the steps . " You know Virgie , " Miss Snowdie murmured , still motionless . " And Katie Blazes , that 's what we used to call your mother , " Mr. King nodded at Virgie . The little patch of hair under his lip  --  not silky , coarse , a pinkish white  --  shook in a ruminating way . Viola , their Negro , had driven him over after giving him his dinner ; she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kitchen . " Sir ? " " I 'll take that coffee if it 's hot and you ai n't drinkingit . Katie Blazes . Did n't you ever hear your mother tell how she never took a dare to put a match to her stockings , girl ? Whsstl Up went the blazes , up to her kneel Sometimes both legs . Cotton stockings the girls used to wear  --  fuzzy , God knows they were . Nobody else among the girls would set fire to their legs . She had the neighborhood scared she 'd go up in flames at an early age . "   " Did you eat your dinner ? " Miss Snowdie turned to him . Virgie watched the black coffee beginning to shake in the little cup . There was something terrifying about that old man  --  he was too old . " In flames ! " He left them and went into the hall of men . " I do n't know what to do with him , " Miss Snowdie said , in a murmur as quiet as the world around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When her flyaway husband had come home a few years ago , at the age of sixty-odd , and stayed , they said she had never gotten over it first his running away , then his coming back to her . " He did n't want to come at all . Now he has her mixed up with Nellie Loomis . " " Virgie , we 've got enough ready to feed an army , " Missie Spights called up the hall . She was coming , untying Miss Katie 's apron from her dress , her arms shining red . " Ham , chickens , potato salad , deviled eggs , and all the cake and folderol people send be-sides . " " Does there have to be so much ? " Virgie asked , going in to meet her . " Watch . The out-of-town relatives are always hun- " er busyness gave Missie an air of abandon , quite impregnable . Parnell Moody stood behind her , dryingevery circle of the potato masher with care . The others were clattering the dishes , putting them in stacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me an hour . " " Mr. King MacLain took himself a nap prett.7 asuyou please . Viola had to shriek in his ear to get him p . " " We 'll all be back early for the funeral , Virgiewishyou 'd let us stay . " Cassie drew her delicate brows , surveying the kitchen which she had never got to . " Everybody who would , I let stay with me . " " It 's a good thing we cut all our flowers , " MissieP247called , fastening her corset behind the door . " Virgie , you have n't a solitary one . " She saw them all , except Miss Snowdie who stayed , get into their cars in the yard , or walk down the path and into the road . As they went , they seemed to drag some mythical gates and barriers away from her view . She looked at the lighted distance , the little last crescent of hills before the country of the river , and the fields . The world shimmered . Cotton fields look busy on Sunday even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their bloom the same . The frail screens of standing trees still measured , broke , divided  --  Stark from Loomis from Spights from Holifield , and the summer from the rain . Each tree like a single leaf , half hair-fine skeleton , half gauze and green , let the first suspicious wind through its old , pressed shape , its summertime branches . The air came smelling of what it was , the end of September . Down the settling dust of the road came an ancientcar . It would turn in here . Old Plez , up until his death , had stopped by to milk and feed the chickensfor Miss Katie Rainey on his way to and from the Starks ' . His grandchildren , still country people , would come today . The car pounded up the hill to her . It was cracked like some put-together puzzle of the globe of the world . Its cracks did n't meet from one side across to the other , and it was all held together with straightened-out baling wire , for today . Next day , next year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at rest on its axles , the four wheels gone and the tires divided up between women and children : two for flowerbeds and two for swings . They had brought the flowers from their dooryard , princess feathers , snow-on-the-mountain . It took them a long time to turn around and get a start back . A little boy ran back with the pan of butterbeans and okra . " All come to the funeral if you can get away ! " she called after them , too late . Virgie walked down the hill too , crossed the road ,   and made her way through the old MacLain place and the pasture and down to the river . She stood on the willow bank . It was bright as mid-afternoon in the openness of the water , quiet and peaceful . She took off her clothes and let herself into the river . She saw her waist disappear into reflectionless water ; it was like walking into sky , some impurity of skies . All was one warmth , air , water , and her own body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she put down her head and closed her eyes and the light slipped under her lids , she felt this matter a translucent one , the river , herself , the sky all vessels which the sun filled . She began to swim in the river , forcing it gently ; as she would wish for gentleness to her body . Her breasts around which she felt the water curving were as sensitive at that moment as the tips of wings must feel to birds , or antenna to insects . She felt the sand , grains intricate as little cogged wheels , minute shells of old seas , and the many dark ribbons of grass and mud touch her and leave her , like suggestions and withdrawals of some bondage that might have been dear , now dismemberingand losing itself . She moved but like a cloud in skies , aware but only of the nebulous edges of her feeling and the vanishing opacity of her will , the carelessness for the water of the river through which her body had already passed as well as for what was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the faded September world the little ripening plums started . Memory dappled her like no more than a paler light , which in slight agitations came through leaves , not darkening her for more than an instant . The iron taste of the old river was sweet to her , though . If she opened her eyes she looked at blue-bottles , the skatingwaterbugs . If she trembled it was at the smoothnessof a fish or snake that crossed her knees . In the middle of the river , whose downstream or upstream could not be told by a current , she lay on her stretched arm , not breathing , floating . Virgiep249hac. reached the point where in the next moment she might turn into something without feeling it shock her . She hung suspended in the Big Black River as she would know to hang suspended in felicity . Far to the west , a cloud running fingerlike over the sun made her splash the water . She stood , walked along the soft mud of the bottom and pulled herself out of the water by a willow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its leaves . At a distance , two little boys lying naked in the red light on the sandbar looked at her as she disappeared into the leaves . They did not move or speak . The moon , while she looked into the high sky , took its own light between one moment and the next . A wood thrush , which had begun to sing , hushed its long moment and began again . Virgie put her clothes back on . She would have given much for a cigarette , always wishing for a little more of what had just been . She went back to the pasture , where the enormous ant hills shone , with long shadows , like pyramids on the other side of the world , and drove the cows home . The crape myrtle had a last crown of bloom on top , once white , now faintly nutmegged . The ground below was littered with its shed bark , and the limbs shone like human limbs , lithe and warm , pink . She went out to milk and came back to the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . The window and the room were the one blue of firstdark . Only the black dress , the density of skirt , was stamped on it , like some dark chip now riding midairon blue lakes . Miss Snowdie MacLain had elected to " sit up " the first hours of night . She slept in the bedroom rocker , in the luminous veil of her dress , the cocoon of her head hanging upon it , and the fan let fall from her fingers.  |p250Virgie  waked to see the morning star hanging over the fields . What had she meant to do so early ? She made and drank her coffee , milked , drove the cows to pasture through mist , chopped wood , and at last she attacked the high grass in the yard . Yesterday cutting the Rainey grass in time for the funeral was considered a project so impossible that even if men could be spared and given scythes , success was never guaranteed . Virgie took her sewing scissors from the little bundle of plaid material in her room , and went outdoors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sawing the heads off the grass  --  it had all gone to seed  --  a handful at a time . She could feel dimmed round Venus still , for she must feel some presence , there was always something , someone , and Venus watching her made the imperceptiblework almost leisurely , then again fierce . The choked-out roses scratched , surprised her , drew blood drops on her legs . She had to come in when Miss Snowdie , whose presence she had forgotten , stepped out on the porch and called her . As though for a long time she had been extremely angry and had wept many tears , she allowed Miss Snowdie to drive her inside the house and cook her breakfast . Then Miss Lizzie Stark 's Juba arrived , followed by a little stairsteps of Negro children bearing curtain stretchers , and Miss Snowdie and Juba began taking down all the curtains . In half an hour these were out in the backyard , stretched and set forth like the tents in the big Bible 's Wilderness of Kadesh . The ladies soon were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First thing , " Missie Spights told Virgie , " you called me Missie Spights yesterday . I 'm married . " " Oh . Yes , I remember . " " I 'm Missie Spights Littlejohn and I 've got three children . I married from off . "  | " I remember , Missie . " Some of Miss Katie 's people arrived by noon , in good time for the funeral  --  big dark people named Mayhew , men and women alike with square , cleft chins and blue eyes . A little string of tow-headed children made a row behind , finishing some bananas . Virgie could n't remember all the Mayhews or tell them apart ; they all came upon her at once , after knocking on the porch to bring her out , all kissed her in greedy turn and begged before they got through the door for ice water or iced tea or both . They had ridden in in several trucks , now drawn up by the porch , from the Stockstill and Lastingwell communities near the Tennessee line . The first thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was to catch up a little child of Missie Spights ' , who was swatting flies , and tickle her violently , speaking soberly over her screams , " Now wait : you do n't know who I am . " Only the same old Rainey came from Louisiana who had come to Fate 's funeral years ago and had n't sent word since . Again he brought his own coffee . Again he offered to fix the front porch and in time , and again was prevented . He was the only Rainey that made the trip . The Raineys were mostly all died out , or could n't leave the fields , or were too far to buy a ticket . The old man explained it all again , and told what had happened to the French name with all the years . " Yes , some are missing , " Miss Perdita Mayo told Virgie when she arrived and saw the lined-up kin . " But you got in touch , or I did for you . If the funeral'ssmall we ca n't reproach ourselves . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nurse had gotten away from old Miss Lizzie , their grandmother , and come to play in the Rainey yard . Gradually other children , Loomis and Maloney , attracted by the magnetic MacLains , played there too , all drunk with the attractions of an untried place , and a place sinister for the day.  |p252The  little Mayhews , every time they were gathered up and brought away from these into the house , cried . Blue jays were scolding the whole morning over the roof , and the logging trucks thundered by , shakingtheir chains and threatening the clean curtains . Miss Perdita Mayo , who had got into the bedroom and formed a circle , was telling a story . " Sister could n't get her new shoes back on after that funeral , because while she was in the cemetery  --  " Suddenly Miss Perdita appeared backing out of the room , thinking herself still telling her story , but mistaken . She had heard the coffin come , and ran to meet it . Mr. Holifield at the hardware store sent his grandsons , Hughie and Dewey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys came inside and made it steady , the Mayhews watching . " Where 's all them Mayhews going to bed down ? " old Mr. Rainey , with nothing to do , asked Virgie , indicating Mayhews with a thumb purpled like a fig . " They wo n't stay . They 're striking right out for Stockstill after the funeral , sir , " said Virgie . " As soon as they 've packed some lunch . " And they were taking the bed , Katie 's bed ; they could set it right up in the truck , they said , looking at it detached from its owner who was lying on it ; and the children could ride home on it instead of standing . Mr. Rainey was shaking his head . " Pity . Never a chance to know those . " He put up a little homed fingerand touched a string on the old banjo of her father 's , which hung on its nail in the hall , the head faintly luminous by morning light . But he did n't play the note . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at length . " And settled hereabouts for the adventure of it . The home-grown flowers came early , and the florist flowers late . Mr. Nesbitt sent word by the janitor in the barbership , who wore gold-rimmed spectacles , that he must be out of town during the funeral , the Negro then bringing out from behind his back a largep253cross of gladiolas and ferns on a stand , evidently from Vicksburg , with Mr. Nesbitt 's card tied on . The Mayhews moved upon it and placed it in front of all the other flowers  --  now steadily being made into wreaths on the back porch  --  where they could look at it during the service , to remember . The Sunday School chairs arrived by wagon , and the Mayhews took them at the door and set them in cater-cornered rows . Had Miss Lizzie Stark been able to come , peoplesaid , it would n't have happened quite the same way . Old Mr. King MacLain did not appear happy over having to come to the Rainey house again today . He fumed , and went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with your mother in ' 18 , or along there , " he said to Virgie , who was folding napkinswith the Stark " S " on them . " You know in those days I was able to make considerable trips off , and only had my glimpses of the people back here . " Miss Snowdie had come to stand folding napkins too . " I 'd come and I 'd go again , only I ended up at the wrong end , would n't you say ? " He suddenly smiled , rather fiercely , but at neither woman . He wore the stiffest-starched white suit Virgie ever saw on any old gentleman ; it looked fierce too  --  the lapels alert as ears . " Saw your mother in a pink sunbonnet . Rosycheeked . ' Hello ! '  --  ' l declare , King MacLain , you look to me as you ever did , strolling here in the road . You rascal . '  --  ' Just for that , what would you rather have than anything ? I 'm asking because I 'm going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So I can sit out front and sell crochet and peaches , if my good-for-nothing husband 'll let me . ' Ah , we all knew sweet old Fate , he was a sweet man among us . Shucks , that 's too easy . Say something else . I 'd have got you anything your living heart desired : Well , I told you . And you mischief , I believe you . ' " Three niggers black as dirtdaubers up to the housep254in a wagon , bang-up noon next day . Up to the door , pounding . " Oh , King MacLain ! You 've brought it so quick-like ! ' " But I ! I was no telling where by that time . Looked to her , I know , like I could n't wait long enough to hear her pleasure . So bent , so bent I was on all I had to do , on what was ahead of me . " She told me how she flew around the yard . Watch out , now , do n't set that down a minute till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrying here , carrying there . Then she put it spang by the road , close as she could get . " And her chair always too big for her , little heels would n't touch ground . It was big enough for a man , big enough for Drewsie Carmichael , ' cause it was his . I prevailed on the widow . Oh , Katie Rainey was a sight , I saw her swing her chair round many 's the time , to hear me coming down the road or starting out , waving her hand to me . And sold more eggs than you 'd dream . Oh , then , she could see where Fate Raineyhad fallen down , and a lovely man , too ; never got her the thing she wanted . I set her on a throne ! " " Mr. King , I never knew the chair came from you , " Virgie said , smiling . He looked all at once inconsolable , but Miss Snowdieshook her head . " Have a little refreshments , sir . There 's ham and potato @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led him down the hall . The Negroes stood by the table with fly swatters . She laid a little piccalilliwith the ham on his plate , which he held for her as long as she 'd help it . When Virgie returned to the parlor , Jinny MacLain came forward to greet her : as if their positions were reversed . Jinny , who in childhood had seemed more knowingthan her years , was in her thirties strangely childlike ; was it old perversity or further tactics ? She toop255arrived at close range , looked at the burns and scars on Virgie 's hands , as Missie Spights had done , makingthem stigmata of something at odds in her womanhood . " Listen . You should marry now , Virgie . Do n't put it off any longer , " she said , making a face , any face , at her own words . She was grimacing out of the iron mask of the married lady . It appeared urgent with her to drive everybody , even Virgie for whom she cared nothing , into the state of marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jinny Love Stark , her true self . She was casting her eye around the room , as if to pick Virgie some husband then and there ; and her eyes rested over Virgie 's head on  --  Virgieknew it  --  Ran MacLain . Virgie smiled faintly ; now she felt , without warning , that two passionate people stood in this roomful , with their indifferent backs to each other . A great many had gathered now . People sat inside and outside , listening and not listening . Young people held hands , all of them taking seats early to reserve the back row . Then some of the Mayhews carried the coffin into the parlor and placed it over the hearth on the four chairs from around the table . The wreaths were stood on edge to hide the chair legs . " What are my children up to ? " Jinny whispered hurriedly , and swept a curtain aside to expose the front yard . " My daughter has chosen today to catch lizards . She 's wearing lizard earrings ! How can she stand those little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself by the window . " Sit by me , Virgie , " said Cassie Morrison , who began to put her handkerchief to her eyes . " This is when it 's the worst , or almost . " There was a new arrival just before the service . Brother Dampeer from Goodnight , whose father was the preacher when Mrs. Rainey was a child and baptizedher as a girl in Cold Creek , in North Mississippi , could n't let her go without one more glimpse , P227brooding voice  --  there was something likeable and understandable about her , with her unbelievable accent . " A long time too you will wait for sandwiches . " She shook her head . " All people here tonight waiting , waiting . If sandwiches , what kind of bread , too ? It is imporrrtant for me to know this . " " Two coffees . One with milk , " Eugene said . He nodded at her . When the waitress brought the coffees , cups swimming in their saucers , she marched off without bringingany sugar . Eugene , remembering the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Spaniard met his glance , and his great black brows slowly lifted and his eyes implored like the eyes of a dog . The shell-rimmed glasses , sanded and smeared , he took off and held in his hand a moment , then put back on . He gave another imploring look . But Eugene only sat there . The Spaniard tried to bring back the waitress with his Spanish , then with a wave of the arm . And at first she only looked at him dreamily without moving , there at the back with her arm propped against the curtain . But then , swinging her hips weightily , she came . He had clapped his hands together ; it woke her right up , like applause . She brought in a sugar jar with a spout . " It was sugar you wanted , " she said to the Spaniard , with baby-talk on top of her accent , as though it had been sugar , sugar for a long time . She patted him on the head . " Go to hell , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a husband . He too is a little man , and sits up as small as you . When he is bad , I peek him up , I stand him on the mantelpiece . " She held out her palm ; Eugene could not help but peek in it . He paid  --  his last penny ; there was a streetcar token left  --  one . " Well , that will be all , " Eugene said , to nobody . The Spaniard had crumbs , sand , sugar , and ashes on him . Outside , back on the corner , the two men turned to each other almost formally . Eugene could only think , in their parting moment , Suppose there had been pastry , would the Spaniard finally have lowered himself to pay ? Then he flew out to catch a streetcar . The Spaniard was left waiting , for what one never would know , alone in the night on a dark corner at the edge of the city . Perhaps he was not so proud now ! At the last glance , he seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Eugene raced up the stairs to the flat and opened the door . There was the smell of strong hot chowder . Emma was in the kitchen but there was feminine talking-away  --  her great friend , Mrs. Herring from next door , had evidently come to stay for supper . Right away he thought he might as well not tell them anything . " You 've left your hat somewhere , " Emma told him . " I 'll be burying you next from pneumonia . " Then , with a stamp of her foot , she showed him  --  and also Mrs. Herring , who was evidently seeing it for the second or third time  --  where the hot grease had splatteredon her hand today . There could n't have been a peep out of Mr. Bertsinger , it occurred to Eugene as he threw off his raincoat . Maybe he was dead ! They sat on at the table after the big meal . Sawing idly at the cheese and to interrupt Mrs. Herring ( in honor of Mrs. Herring , who had returned from a trip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt called on to make one remark . " Saw Long-Hair , the guitar player , today , saw him walking along the street just like you or me . What was his name , anyway ? " he asked , as if he wondered now for the first time . " Bartolome Montalbano , " Emma said and popped a grape onto her extended tongue . She added , " I have the feeling he suffers from indigestion , " and drummed her breast while she swallowed . " . . . He 's a Spaniard . " " A Spaniard ? There was a Spaniard at early
