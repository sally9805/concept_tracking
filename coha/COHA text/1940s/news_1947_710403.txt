txt The world 's closest approach to a perfect monopoly appears to be adjusting itself successfully , though perhaps a trifle nervously , to a recent slumping demand . That 's the diamond mining industry , which exercises remarkable restraint in keeping supply in step with demand . From diamond auction rooms on the Bowery. deep in the heart of New York City 's ragged lower East Side , comes word that sales of gem diamonds are down 25% from a rather high post-war peak hit last year . This reflects a slackening demand for these luxury items that showed up in jewelry stores across the United States , chief diamond buying nation , six months or more ago . No News to De Beers But this is no news to De Beers Consolidated Mines , Ltd .. and its affiliated companies . This big British combine is generally credited with controlling 95% of all diamonds mined and sold throughout the world . The " diamond syndicate . " as London more familiarly refers to De Beers and its associates . began several months ago to adjust to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statistics tells the story . In January and February this year a trifling 39.600 carats of rough diamonds were imported into Antwerp . world 's leading center for cutting , and polishing into gems or into rougher stones for industrial uses . That 's only 1.9% of the approximately two million carats of rough diamonds rushed to Antwerp in the full year 1916 , to meet a booming postwar demand . Other diamond cutting centers , of which Amsterdam is the most important , report similar experience in getting far fewer " roughs " this year . Some cutting also is done it New York , and in Palestine and Cuba . These rough stones , mined in Africa , are marketed . through Dc Beers ' Diamond Trading Co. at London " sights . " a method of selling unique to the diamond business . Packets of diamonds are made up in varying qualities of stones , to suit the needs of individual buyers . Prices are fixed by the syndicate on a " take it or leave it basis , " although occasionally a substitute stone will be put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Word from London yesterday declared that business had picked up at recent " sights " and compared favorably with the like 1946 period . This would appear a logical development , in view of the extremely few " roughs " reaching cutters hands earlier this year . Prices Being Maintained In its recent annual report to stockholders . De Beers directors recognized the falling off in demand that started last year But the report added , significantly : ' The diamond trade is in a particularly sound position and the industry 's level of prices : s being firmly maintained " Sales of rough diamonds this sear will probably be much reduced , declared Sir Ernest Oppenheimer , De Beers chairman , at the company 's annual meeting yesterday . See story on Page 2I Diamond dealers in the United States agree about that price firmness . There has been some modest decline in the price of poor er quality stones but prices of better stones , under a managed scarcity system , have held up well And those prices are far above pre-war . Although it 's difficult to compare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New York who is close to the industry says that prices of " melee " ( little stones that range up to carat I are about triple pre-war . while prices of big stones ( a carat and morel are about 50% above pre-war days . Prices of stones in between  --  i .. to 1 carat  --  are appar ently up anywhere from 50% to 100% . But while the syndicate has been able to maintain firm diamond prices in the face of a declining demand It has been aware of several threats . As yet , though , none appears too serious to its tight control of the industry . A careful check of the diamond markets of Antwerp and Amsterdam , reveals the presence of what the diamond men call " outside goods " Parcels of rough stones bought from the syndicate just before and during the war , sometimes as an investment and sometimes for the war-horn cutting industries in Palestine . Cuba and the United States , are being offered in Belgium and Holland at less than the syndicate price . But it is explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Operations There 's another undermining factor pres. ent in the Antwerp market . For diamonds selling at $225 a carat , for example , certain traders pay the equivalent of $240 a carat . They are able to do this by buying Belgium francs in the black market at the rate of 88 franca to the American dollar , about double the number they would get at the official exchange rate So the actual cost to them Is only about $120 a carat . Diamonds so obtained , If successfully smuggled to the United Staten , would reach New York at a total cost of about $145 a carat . This In about awe-thirds the Antwerp selling price . Similar operations reportedly are carried on through Amsterdam . Reports from Antwerp and Amsterdam say the Belgian and Dutch governments are expected to work In cooperation with the diamond Industry to eliminate this practice . It Is expected that a forthcoming customs union ( eliminating tariff harrieral covering Belgium , the Netherlands and Luxembourg . will facilitate control over foreign exchange and exports . Overhanging the diamond syndicate , however , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troubles . That is the emergence of an independent diamond mine owner of some substantial size who has n't yet signed up with the cartel . Story of Dr. Williamson This independent is a Canadian , Dr. J. T Williamson . But he has come into possession of valuable diamond properties in Tanganyika Territory in Africa . Last year , according to word from London , his production was estimated at $4 million ; that compares with about $118 million of diamonds marketed by the syndicate in London in 1946 . But until Dr. Williamson decides to join the syndicate  --  a step which London diamond men regard , rightly or wrongly , as inevitable ? his production must be added to the approximtely 5% of the world 's total which is produced and sold outside the British combine . Some French West African mines , as well as mines in Brazil , Venezuela and British Guiana , have kept apart from the syndicate The Williamson production . plus the French and other supplies . plus the- " outside goods " reaching Antwerp and Amsterdam , all mean the syndicate lust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the marketed diamonds . Perhaps it 's 90 ' 1i  --  or less . And there are some in the trade who suggest that near-monopolies are n't so safe when more than 10 , C. of production is not under their control . Such a situation makes more difficult the diamond syndicate policy of always trying to keep the supply a little less than demand . It demand shows signs of declining . supply is cut . If a grave crisis develops , supply is cut off altogether . Some major African mines have been held out of production for years , to keep supply matched with demand . Belgian , Dutch Control Imports Belgian and Dutch governments cooperate with such strategy . They control imports of rough diamonds by foreign exchange regulations . Then limited supplies entering the countries are strictly apportioned among cutters . The diamond industry in both countries joins in the control system , too . In Belgium this has taken the form of a three-day work week , to control production while accumulated stocks of finished stones are disposed of . This action has not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only the other day the Belgian National Joint Employers ' and Workers ' Diamond Committee met . Their problem : Deciding whether to continue a three-day work week , extend it to four days . abandon all work restrictions  --  or , going to the other extreme  --  declare a complete production holiday . In Amsterdam a curtailed work week has not been necessary . That 's because there 's a labor shortage in the industry , due to German extermination of Jews during the war . Of 3.500 pie-war workers about 2.500 were killed by the Germans , mostly at the Oswiecim murder camp . This left only about 1.000 workers many past their peak . Some 500 appren*ices are now being trained . Antwerp , on the other hand , has about 16.000 workers .
