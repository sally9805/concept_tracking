txt Letters to The Times Peace and the Atom Bomb Principle of Joint Coercion of Great Powers Is Held to Be a Fallacy To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The grim determination with which Mr. Baruch clings to his view of the " veto " is matched , only by the stern inflexibility of THE NEW YORK TIMES in giving him editorial support . Such tenacity of purpose is worthy of a better cause . This one contains a tragic fallacy which spells frustration and ultimate catastrophe if it is not exposed and corrected . The core of error lies in the contention that peace can be kept through the collective waging of war by sovereignties against sovereignties . In the Charter this idea was abandoned in favor of the proposition that peace can be kept only through a concert of super-powers  --  all of which must consent in law to any international coercion , since each can resist in fact any combination of coercive pressures brought to bear against it . The defects of this dispensation can not be alleviated by returning to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempts , at Geneva and elsewhere , to compel fulfillment of obligations through joint coercion of great powers have invariably led lo failure or to hostilities . Violation and War Honest confessions of consequences is good for clarity of thought . In " The Law of the Atom " ( Dec. 22 ) . THE TIMES rightly conceded that the relationship between a government violating atomic agreements and the other United Nations would be one of war . It then went on to argue , in effect , that the threat of war should consequently be relied upon as a means of insuring good faith and stopping violations " at once , without debate . " The spokesmen of Canada ( which would be the first victim of the only possible war to which this reasoning leads ) have wisely pointed out that war is still war , with or without the veto and regardless of whether it is waged in the name of the United States or U. N. On Dec. 27 Mr. Baruch acknowledged that under his proposals all nations accepting the treaty must realize " that its willful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hence peace requires the abolition of the veto in order that war against violators may be facilitated . This unintentional reductio ad absurdum of the American position is not rendered plausible by Mr. Baruch 's effort to equate it with " enduring justice " and " plain common sense , " by his palpably erroneous statement that his demand is " entirely consistent with the letter and spirit of the Charter , " nor by his demonstrably false argument that the sanctity of treaties can be assured only through war . To say , with THE TIMES , ? " there can be no compromise on these principles " which " rest on la*s as immutable as the laws of the atom itself " is to say that the whole enterprise must fail and that mankind must reconcile itself to eventual incineration because of its incapacity to distinguish between delusions and realities . Nations Versus Individuals The Founding Fathers analyzed with unanswerable logic the precise question here at issue . They declared in The Federalist that punishment of governments , as distinct from individuals , " is subversive of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place of law , or the destructive coercion of the sword in place of the mild and salutary coercion of the magistracy . " ( No. 15 ) " The principle of legislation for sovereign states , supported by military coercion , has never been found effectual . " ( No. 16 ) " Government implies the power of making laws . It is essential to the idea of law that it be attended with * * * a punishment for disobedience . ( But ) in an association where the general authority is confined to the collective bodies ( i. e. sovereign governments ) of the communities that compose it , every breach of the laws must involve a state of war . " ( No. 28 ) . The remedy proposed was to enforce law not on governments through armies but on individuals , whether public officials or private persons , through prosecutors and courts . That Mr. Baruch and THE TIMES are unable to recognize the remedy and insist instead on seeking disarmament and security among men through war among governments is an unhappy commentary on the degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There will be no solution of the problem of the bomb nor any protection against future aggression within the obsolete context of enforcing obligations by punishing governments . A solution will emerge only when America proposes , and the Soviet Union accepts , a program for the enforcement of global atomic law on individuals all over the earth , with the cooperation of the law-abiding officials of all governments and with adequate U. N. agencies of inspection , prosecution and conviction operating within all national frontiers to insure individual obedience to the supreme law of all lands . Pattern of Power In such a process , once it is operative , there can neither be any veto to protect lawbreakers nor any coercion of governments as such . To seek peace through the punishment of sovereignties is to perpetuate a pattern of power which breeds inevitable war . " Happily for America and happily , we trust , for the whole human race , " the original Federalists , in their own words ( No. 14 ) , " ' pursued a new and more noble course . * * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incumbent on their successors to improve and perpetuate . " The extension of this design to the world problem of atomic energy is the price of survival of U. N. and of contemporary civilization . From Article 27 of the Charter men must not move backward to Article 16 of the Covenant but forward to a global equivalent of Article 6 of the Constitution of the United States . This road to peace has thus far been ignored by America 's leaders in their resolve to . revert to a road which can lead only to disaster . That they should honestly believe that the proposals they have made spell salvation rather than destructioiL is the mease2e of the danger confronting America and the whole human race in 1947 and thereafter . Although he has not yet grasped the problem , Mr. Baruch is more right than he know . when he says : " Gentlement , it is either * * or . " FREDERICK L. SCHUMAN .
