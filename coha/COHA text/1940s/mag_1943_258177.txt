In the murky dawn hour when Kiev fell , the battle for the Dnieper had virtually ended , the battle for western Russia had begun . <P> If proof of the vast turn in the Russian war were needed , Moscow provided it last week with an official map of the summer and fall gains . Last April , the Red Army published a map showing the gains of the previous winter . On the western fringe of that map lay Odessa , Kiev , Mogilev , Vitebsk-all still deep in the enemy 's rear . On the western fringe of the map published in Moscow newspapers last week lay Bucharest , Warsaw , Konigsberg in East Prussia . <P> The New Phase of the war had begun auspiciously . West of Kiev , mobile Soviet columns spread out for 45 miles like the tentacles of a huge octopus , seizing vast booty , disorganizing German resistance . Moscow 's Pravda quoted Nazi prisoners : " The swiftness of events defies description . " <P> South of Kiev : <P> &gt; After a 130-mile dash in twelve days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emplacements across the Dnieper . <P> &gt; After a hard battle , two beachheads were won near Kerch . Cut off from all land routes of escape , the German garrison in the Crimea was now being slowly compressed . <P> &gt; At Krivoi Rog , the Wehrmacht continued its desperate , costly-and thus far successful-struggle to keep open an escape corridor for the forces still within the Dnieper bend . <P> North of Kiev : <P> &gt; In the Nevel sector , which looks like a dagger aimed at the Baltic States and northern Poland , there was fierce action again , and the Germans acknowledged a " major penetration " of their lines . West of Nevel some Russian columns were now within 50 miles of the Latvian , 40-odd miles of the Polish border . Gomel still faced doom and Red troops were barely a dozen miles from German held Vitebsk . <P> Vistas . Though the Germans had not yet admitted it , Hitler 's vaunted Dnieper line ( " Here I am and here I shall remain " ) was no more . From a point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Black Sea , the Dnieper 's left bank was virtually clear of the foe . <P> The Red Army had thus ended what was probably the toughest part of the offensive begun at Stalingrad a year ago . It had beaten the Wehrmacht in its prime , vaulted over two great river barriers ( Donets , Dnieper ) , captured the strongest of the enemy 's strongholds ( Rostov , Kharkov , Orel , Bryansk , Smolensk , Melitopol , Kiev ) . <P> The Wehrmacht was still strong , but it was now a cornered , wounded panther , no longer able to mount an offensive on the eastern front . It could still seek refuge behind the Bug or the Dniester , but neither was an obstacle as tough as the Dnieper , and both were frighteningly close to the borders of German Europe . <P> From Kiev , General Vatutin 's army could now plunge directly west into Poland , only 130 miles away . Or it could swerve southwest , to try to set yet another trap for the German forces in the southern Ukraine . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fresh , supply lines from the east presumably restored in the past six weeks . <P> Blood &; Steel . But it had taken Rus sian lives and steel to alter the maps , to change the goals . Both Moscow and Berlin last week totaled up the cost to each other of the summer and fall offensive , came out with incredible but nevertheless significant figures :
