A N the spring of I he first year I was governor of South Dakota , t he annual convention of the Young Citizens League was held at Pierre . This was a new state-wide organization of school children below the high-school trades , and I was much interested in its welfare and success . At one of the convention sessions , Donab Robinson , the state historian , submit ted a proposition that the Young Citizens League take charge of raising funds for the Rushmore Memorial . Until that moment , I had never heard of the Rushmore Memorial . I listened to the proposal and then asked for permission to appear before the league in opposition , contending that the children in the grade schools ought not to be burdened with a proposition of this kind . The league turned the proposal down . Not so long after that , however , Doane Robinson , in company with Gutzon Borglum , came to roe and with a good deal of enthusiasm discussed what they had in mind . It sounded all right , but at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to raise the necessary funds by public donation and subscription . Funds for a starter had already been subscribed . Borglum , who was a born promoter , then worked up a great advertising stunt by having President Coolidge , while he was visiting the state , dedicate ' the mountain . The services drew a tremendous crowd of people . In addition to the President 's address , the event gave Borglum a chance to make a speech and tell what he intended to do . He actually had the fortitude to " authorize " President Coolidge to prepare a short history of the United States , of a few hundred words , which he , Borglum , would than carve on the mountain peak opposite the gigantic statues of Washington , Jefferson , Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt , which he planned to hew out of the granite . President Coolidge accepted the job , but he did n't know what he was getting into . When the manuscript was completed and submitted several years Later , about the time Mr. Coolidge 's term expired , the sculptor decided it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Borglum got the Hearst newspapers interested in a Mt . Rushmore promotion scheme and staged a widely publicized contest , offering a first prize of ten thousand dollars for the best short history of the United States . More than ten thousand persons , from all sections of the country , submitted manuscripts . A general committee was named to select the five best , and the five thus chosen were submitted to a special committee of five United States senators for the final choice . By that time I was a member of the United States Senate and was one of the committee of five . In my judgment , all five manuscripts were excellent ; any one of them was worth carving on the mountainside . The committee made its choice , and Borglum promptly turned it down . Moreover , het took a look at the four others and threw them away . He said that someone would have to produce a better history than bad yet been written or he would write one himself . Borglum had , however , accomA horn promoter , Borglurn persuaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the things next to his heart  --  the advertisement of Gutzon Borglum and Mt . Rushmore . A million dollars could not have purchased the advertising that the Hearst papers gave Gutzon , Mt . Rushmore and the state of South Dakota in publicizing the contest . The original Mt . Rushmore committee was a group of local citizens that Doane Robinson bad gathered together and interested in the proposal . This committee was succeeded by a larger and very prominent group of wealthy and philanthropic citizens scattered all over the United States . Considerable sums of money were thus raised in the earlier stages of the work . In order to give more permanency to the project , Congress created the national Mt . Rushmore Commission , the members of that commission to be appointed by the President . Since the death of the sculptor several years ago , the Rushmore Memorial has been placed under the supervision of our national-park system . From the time Congress created the Mt . Rushmore Commission , the work has been financed by Federal appropriations from year to year . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the obtaining of necessary appropriations to keep the work going . Gutzon Borglum was not an easy man to work with , but he was , I am convinced , a really great sculptor . I doubt that any other artist living had the vision and the ability to carve those magnificent heads in the living granite of a mountainside . But as a financier and diplomat , Gutzon stood down on the bottom round of the ladder . To obtain the necessary appropriations for the first few years under the national commission was comparatively easy , but the job became harder each year , until toward the last it was nearly impossible . Borglum always insisted that he himself should appear before the appropriations committee in behalf of his requested budget . His memory was not very good and he had difficulty in remembering his statements from one meeting to another . Some of the committee members , on the other hand , were hard-boiled and had good memories . Gutzon would nearly always end his plea to the committee with the promise that this would be the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the job . The next year he would be back asking for a substantial increase because he had thought of a lot of new things that he was going to add to the memorial . At one point he decided that there ought to be a Hall of Fame . This was to be housed in a large cave excavated in the solid granite of the mountain and would include an archives room where the national records could be stored and sealed  --  to be opened in ten thousand years . In due course of time he had talked a number of prominent people into letting him make marble busts of them , to he placed in the archives room . And then he thought he ought to carve a stairway from the bottom of the mountain up to the doorway of the Hall of Fame and to the room of archive &; I remember particularly the bitter dispute between Mr. Borglum and Senator Norbeck about the stairway . This was in the New Deal leaf-raking days , the days when the Government was hiring people to carry stones from one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had arranged for a Government works project to build this stairway with idle labor in that vicinity . It would be paid for from relief funds and not from Mt . Rushmore funds . Gutzon blew up when he heard this proposal , and be and the senator got into quite a row . Borglum was no financier , but be knew that he was getting a very liberal percentage commission for every dollar that he spent on the memorial ; if the stairway was built with relief labor , he would get no commission on that part of the project . This would be bad , and he would not stand for it . The plan to build the stairway with relief funds was dropped . In fact , the stairway has never been built . Work was started on the Hall of Fame and the archives room , but never finished . Over the years I urged Borglum in every way that I could to devote all his time to completing the carving of the figures . That was work that he , and only he , could do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job would never be finished . Any miner , I told him , could blast out the cave in the mountain for the archives room , but there was no one else who could carve the face of Lincoln on the mountain . Borglum did not expect to die when he did and leave the job uncompleted . The last talk I had with him was just a few weeks before his death . I was begging him to complete the figures , as I had begged him many times before . He said that I need not be disturbed about that . He had just gone through a clinic and had had a complete physical checkup ; he was in perfect health , he said , and would live for many years . I know from personal experience that no one could get along with Mr. Borglum for any length of time without losing his temper  --  unless one was a saint , and there are few human saints . I never had so many rows with any other person as I had with him  --  sometimes over important things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We were probably equally to blame . Borglum never carried a grudge . Early in our acquaintanceship , we often parted in the evening'witb Borglum vowing he never would speak to me again . But the next morning would be a brand-new day , and Borglum would extend a hearty handshake and a cordial good morning . That cordiality would hold good if we did not visit too long . If we talked too much and discussed too many subjects , it would become necessary for us to part again in anger . Most of my first year as governor , Gutzon constantly made life miserable for me . His chief peeve at that time was that there was no road to Mt . Rushmore . There was just a trail that could be traveled only on foot or by horseback . When President Coolidge dedicated the mountain he rode horseback up the mountain trail and wore a ten-gallon cowboy bat . There were a few other horseback riders , including Senator Fees , of Ohio . Senator Fees was not a good bronco iCantinmed on Paso 1051 rider and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Senator , ride up here by my side  --  it wo n't hurt you any . " There were not bronMe enough to go around , so I walked , as did several thousand other people who climbed the mountain trail that day . To Borglum , Mt . Rushmore was the post important thing on earth  --  the center of the universe . Everything else ries of secondary importance . But Mt . Rushmore had no highway leading to it . It must have a highway . The State Highway Commission must build this That was San Francisco at five o'clock Tumidity morning . ' Flint was it . They called the hospital from there after the two local . oca. men Look the clerk away to chock fingerprints ; they talked to Harry Schwartz , who sounded very tired and very happy , and who told thorn that they had just taken Inspector McDermott out of the operating room , and that everyone seemed to he pretty well setistied with h him now . After that , Devlin end lelit Monahan looked at each other self-consciously , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remember till sorts of things about Chicago and Omaha . . . Salt Lake too . They walked back to their hotel . It was getting light nut the streets were practically empty and the fog gone . Of course , Ida Monahan remarked presently , it should have been obvious all the time that this lawyer would get himself a job where he had to live in , like a handy man , or a hotel clerk , or a short-order cook at a country hamburger stand . That way they could Check all the hotels and rooming houses and never find him , because they 'd be looking for a guest , and not for someone who worked there . So , in her opinion , Devlin should not allow himself to get conceited over it . It had not been anything wonderful , after all . But Devlin caught a peculiar note in her voice  --  something grudging , almost envious . Back in Salt Lake she had found out that the Japanese stuff did n't work out all the time ; here , Devlin told himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have found out something else  --  who was the better man . . . or the better cop , anyway . He took her arm  --  no argument this time  --  he swung her around , and she flushed in that way she had , and looked at him and away quickly . " That 's right , " she said . " Bully me . You think you can throw a girl all over like a sack of potatoes in Salt Lake City , and then when you get out here ? " She looked at him again . She said tightly , " Darn you , anyway . All I ever wanted was a big man . And now I suppose ? " " I can get those elevator heels , " Devlin said . " Look , " Ida Monahan said , " If you were six feet four , nobody would hold you . I guess I 'm just stuck . That is , if you still want to like a creature like me , and take her around , and ? Well , you know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the time . Ida Monahan gave him a strange sort of glance  --  amused , tender , demure , secretly triumphant . " Well , as far as that goes , " Ida Monahan said , " who did n't ' ? " THE END road at once . The governor was chairman of the highway commission , so Mr. Borglum took all matters up with me . Almost every day he would demand that the road be built , and after each demand he expected that the job be completed before breakfast next morning . I especially recall one telegram that he sent me . I recall it because it was the longest telegram I ever received and contained the most expressive language . There were more than 300 words in that telegram , and Gutzon did n't repeat himself . Every word meant something . It was a masterpiece . I wish now that I had kept it to insert here . I remember , among other things , he said that he had just returned from the mountain . That it had rained . That he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fire well .

( Cool frrom Page 106I upon that marble bust , and marveled at , its beauty . No other artist in Jill the world could take a piece of cold find expressionless marble and reflect there so well the likeness of the face of America 's best beloved  --  the most beautiful face in ail American history . Upon one occasion Mr. Borglum and I were visiting in the Rotunda together . We stood before the hind of Lincoln , I complimented the sculptor , as beet I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me that the Lincoln bust was the work of a lifetime . Before undertaking the task he bad spent years in studying the life of Lincoln ; he had read every book that had been written about Lincoln ; he knew Lincoln and had his likeness emblazoned upon his own memory before he undertook to produce the likeness in marble . Those of you who have made a pilgrimage to Gettysburg have seen the memorial there erected by the citizens of North Carolina in honor of their heroic dead . That monument is a group of soldiers cast in bronze  --  and it was created by Gutzon Borglum . Everyone who has ever looked at that monument returns Jae miry " ? , for a second look , and then for a third , It is by all odds the most attractive memorial on that historic field . The best view of Mt . Rushmore , I feel , is the one seen as you look througli the tunnel , as you drive up the paved highway toward the mountain . AB you approach the entrance of the tunnel , looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they were encased in a picture frame . As one looks at Mt . Rushmore from any angle , it is awe-inspiring . I have never talked with anyone who has not admitted that his heart beat faster with patriotic pride as he gazed upon that heroic shrine . People who claim to know tell me that Mt . Rushmore is not subject to erosion ; that its granite is everlasting ; that a thousand years of winter snows and winter storms , and a thousand years of summer rains and summer suns will leave no mark upcn it . Generations hence , when we who had our troubles with Mr. Borglum are forgot-i ten , the name of the man who carved those noble figures in the granite will be remembered . Gutzon could be a little difficult at times , but there was greatness in him .
