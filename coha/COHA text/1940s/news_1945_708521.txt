txt Prof. Herbert F. Rudd has made a thoughtful and helpful analysis of the half-dozen leading suggestions for a sound basis of world organization , with a view to achieving fair representation for all nations on the governing body of the world organization which is to be created to deal with the problems of the world . His own suggestion is that power over international affairs should belong to an assembly of 400 members , with 100 distributed on the basis of population , 100 on the basis of industrial production , 100 on the basis of foreign trade and 100 on the basis of general literacy and health achievements among the people . Such a plan does not seem to me to be either feasible or desirable . According to the League of Nations Statistical Year Book , 1940-41 , the total world population was then 2,169,837,000 . On a continental basis , Africa had 157 , - 330,000 inhabitants ; Asia , exclusive of the U.S.S.R. , 1,154,000,000 ; Europe , 402,000,000 ; the U.S.S.R. , 172,000,000 ; North America , 184,260,000 ; South America , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question I pose is , " Is any solution of this problem which does not give adequate representation to all the inhabitants of the earth a sound basis for a world constitution ? " It is true we must be realistic and take the world as it is constituted , rather than as it might be if we had an ideal human society . The Big Three or Four " Great Nations " ( with help of small nations ) have fought and are fighting and winning the battle for a free world . It is necessary , therefore , to accord to them the privilege and responsibility for safeguarding the dearly won peace which is to follow World War II and for preventing a recurrence of such a terrible calamity . I venture to suggest , however , that the unheard millions also have a right to a voice in shaping and running the world to come . To my mind , something analogous to universal suffrage might well be included as a basis for a World Parliament of Man , the dream of farseeing poets and thinkers . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , selected on the basis of states or nations , and a House of Representatives , based on population . Taxation without representation is pretty well accepted to constitute tyranny . May not domination of the world without representation be likewise considered tyranny ? When I read your editorial " They Need News , " of March 31 , I was impelled to write one of those indignant letters of protest signed " Former Subscriber . " But then I read your second editorial , " Germany 's Death Throes , " in which you stated perfectly the argument that I was prepared to hurl in your teeth . In the first editorial you say that broadcasts into Germany from OWI ( and presumably other Allied sources ) have been " singularly ineffective " because they contained too much " propaganda " material " and too little factual information  --  about the crescendo of American production , for one thing ; about the true temper and resolution of the Allied peoples and the extent of their sacrifices . " You say : " Where we have failed most is in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second editorial you make the all-too-truthful statement that " twelve years of regimentation and propaganda have left the German people * * * devoid of will and * * * unable to recognize the most obvious facts . " Truth Unrecognized In other words , factual information , or news , is the best propaganda ; but unfortunately the German people have lost the capacity to recognize it . At the time of Pearl Harbor , those of us who were working with our British allies on the formation of propaganda policy agreed that we could never hope to compete with Dr. Goebbels or his Japanese brethren in the fabrication of fantasy ; we were convinced that our greatest weapon was truth , and we stuck to that conviction in all of our broadcasts , leaflets and other products . At first we had to speak frankly of defeats ? in the Philippines , in Malaya , in Libya  --  and we did so , believing that thus we would gain a reputation for credibility if not for propagandistic skill . We gave the facts about " the crescendo of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by our Government . When , to any recitation of facts , we added editorial opinion , it was opinion expressed in THE NEW YORK TIMES and other reputable American journals , including the Congressional Record . The BBC was following precisely the same policy from London , and so latex was the United Nations Radio from North Africa , and so were the Psycho. logical Warfare branched when they were able to carry the news into the Continent of Europe . Do n't Want Facts And now we read the appalling story of conditions in Germany as told by Raymond Daniell and others  --  and Mr. Daniell 's reports confirm the discouraging impressions I gained in Europe from close study of the masses of interviews with German prisoners . The German people believed the Hitler-Goebbels lies because they wanted to believe them ; and for the same reason they refused to believe the truth when it was made available to them . They still refuse to believe it , even when they see it expressed in terms of tanks and planes and guns and millions of conquering Allied troops ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unable to recognize the most obvious facts . " It is my conviction that the re-education of the German people can not start until they have come from the depths of bitter defeat to the painful realization that they have been the stupidest dupes in modern history . Perhaps they are incapable of coming by themselves to that realization  --  and perhaps there is no way of driving it home to them , even with psychological bulldozers ; but one must hope . I want to send you this letter to say how very good I thought your editorial of March 29 , entitled " OPA and Profits Control . " It is , of course , true that OPA 's socalled " Industry Earnings Standard " has given rise to some misunderstanding . Your simple statement that this standard is a floor under profits is entirely accurate , for if over-all profits fall below pre-war profits , increases are granted . Certainly , it is also correct to say that so far there is little indication that the American economy has been adversely affected by the application of this standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think bears further explanation . Your comment that " In some cases undue delays in making adjustments " might well be the more appropriate criticism . With that , I think , we at OPA are in accord . We recognize that delays have caused businses men some difficulties , and in the last year and a half particularly we have taken many a step to cut these to a minimum . Of course , no small part of our problem on this score is the trouble we have in securing specific and accurate information from industries or firms who request price adjustments . Necessarily , we have had to set certain criteria and yardsticks for price increases in order to comply with the law . Without proper information we can not apply those criteria to the requests of business , and the adjustments are often delayed primarily for that reason . Just recently we made a study to determine the cause for delays in making certain adjustments . We found that some two-thirds of the time needed to make adjustments was spent in getting proper and accurate figures from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understanding of our need for such figures , I 'm sure they will cooperate . If they do , final determinations as to any increase in prices can be made in most cases very much more promptly . OPA will continue to develop ways and means to speed up our procedures . But to do an effective job on this score we need the full cooperation of those who ask for these increases . Thank you for your editorial of March 28 on the President 's request that Cordell Hull 's trade agreements be renewed . Unless they are renewed , Bretton Woods , Dumbarton Oaks , Yalta and the Atlantic Charter become only words . Whether our foreign trade amounts to 1 or 10 per cent more or less is not so important as keeping the door open to trade . Civilization began when two men first traded with each other . Anything that interferes with trade retards civilization . Commerce is not a curse to be restricted or prevented by tariffs , and as to the fear that foreigners will flood our markets with cheap goods , there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind that they can dump on us even if inclined to . No foreign producer can in any way force us to buy anything we do not want . We import goods because we want them and are willing to pay for them . Trade involves mutual consent and gratification , not aggression on one side and resistance on the other . Trade prevents war , eradicates prejudices and diffuses knowledge . A declaration that we will put on the free list the products of any country that will admit our products free will create mutually profitable business .
