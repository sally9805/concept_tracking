The Germans had hoped to make another Stalingrad of stately , romantic Budapest . The city was a natural fortress in the first major defense line of Germany 's deep backyard . The heights of Buda , rising some 770 feet above the Danube , commanded the approaches to Pest . The Germans had time to rim the city with strong points . The 950-foot river itself was a formidable last ditch . The Germans had men and machines . The Russians had to bring both over a tenuous supply line that looped far around the Carpathians . <P> This week the flames of Budapest lighted a major German failure and another pressing predicament for the German command . The first formidable backyard gate was all but battered down . But Budapest did not alone represent the problem . The Red Army had already gone beyond that victory . In effect it had two great victories in one . <P> Before Budapest 's fate was sealed , the month and a half battle for it had also become the battle for the Kisalfld , the triangular " Little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Austria , as its apex . By this week the Russians had won a series of battles for the Kisalfld 's approaches , stood upon it on both sides of the Danube . Vienna , the inner gate to Germany 's back door , was now the German worry . <P> In Budapest the Germans fought to the bitter end long after it had become tactically unimportant . How much the city had suffered was not told , but it could not have escaped vast damage . The first of the satellite capitals to feel war 's destruction , it stood this week as a monument to the Germans ' readiness to sacrifice somebody else 's possessions , and to the Russians ' complexity of attack .
