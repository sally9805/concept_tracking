Labor 's Communist-liners bent under some hard hammering last week : <P> In Washington , 36-year-old Harold Christoffel , onetime president of Milwaukee 's United Automobile Workers ( C.I.O . ) Local 248 and leader of two long , bitter strikes at the Allis-Chalmers plant , stood long-faced as a federal judge sentenced him to prison for two to six years for perjury . He had lied repeatedly to the House Labor Committee when he denied being a Communist or having Communist affiliations ( TIME , June 9 ) . <P> In Manhattan , the Justice Department 's drive on alien Communists caught up with Russia-born Irving Potash , vice president of the C.I.O. 's International Fur &; Leather Workers Union , member of the Communist Party 's national committee . He was hustled off to Ellis Island , where he joined four others held as deportable Communists. * He also joined them in what they cried was a hunger strike against their being denied bail . At week 's end all were free on bond , pending hearings . None looked the worse for his fast . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Haywood delivered the bad news to Red-eyed Harry Bridges : he was fired as a C.I.O. regional director for refusing to go along with Murray 's policy of opposing Henry Wallace 's third party . Australia-born Harry Bridges ' grip on about 75,000 longshoremen was not affected . But he was expecting more bad news - another attempt to deport him . <P> In Washington , before a House Labor subcommittee , broken-nosed Herbert K. Sorrell , whose A.F.L. Conference of Studio Unions has had Hollywood cinemakers in strike ferment for three years , denied over &; over that he had ever been a Communist Party member . Shown a C.P. card signed " Herbert Stewart " ( Sorrell 's mother 's name was Stewart ) , he cried " fake , " but admitted that it looked like his handwriting . An expert swore that it was . <P> <P> * The four : Gerhart Eisler ( TIME , Feb. 16 ) ; John Williamson , the Communist Party 's labor secretary ; Ferdinand Smith , secretary of the C.I.O. 's National Maritime Union ( TIME , Feb. 23 ) ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C.I.O. 's United Gas , Coke &; Chemical Workers .
