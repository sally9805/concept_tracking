If your doctor tells you that you have a blood pressure of 130 , he means that you 're all right on that score . ( Normal adult blood pressure : 110 to 150 . ) He also means that the pressure in your arteries will drive up a column of mercury 130 millimetres high , or a column of water about five feet ten inches high . Hypertension , or high blood pressure , causes headaches , dizziness , insomnia , leads eventually to hardened arteries and overburdened hearts . Hypertension kills more people a year-some 375,000 in the U. S. - than cancer . Specialists call patients with high blood pressure " hypertensives . " Dr. Irvine H. Page did not bother with these ABCs of the malady when last week he delivered a lecture in Manhattan on " The Nature and Treatment of Hypertension . " Dr. Page , a top-notch high pressure man from Indianapolis , showed that great strides have been taken in his specialty in the short space of seven years . Doctors used to take a defeatist view of hypertension , ascribed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Treatment consisted mostly in keeping patients relaxed and calm by persuasion and drugs . Now there is something better . <P> Nerves , endocrine glands and liver are all involved in hypertension . But apparently it 's the kidneys that count most . The typical hypertensive has clogged kidneys ; his nerves and glands are often perfectly sound . <P> By a series of ingenious experiments , researchers found renin , an organic chemical manufactured by the kidneys , which raised the blood pressure of animals . They also found an activator in the blood plasma which enabled renin to work . The combination of renin and this activator was dubbed angiotonin . As a working hypothesis , angiotonin was marked as the chemical cause of high pressure . Further experiments showed that normal kidneys probably manufacture an " inhibitor " substance , which destroys or neutralizes surplus angiotonin , keeps the pressure within normal bounds . Two research teams , including Dr. Page 's in Indianapolis , recovered from kidney extract inhibitors which lowered the pressure of animals 50 to 100 points . <P> Then , at last , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relief to hypertensive humans . For the past year 17 lucky patients of Dr. Page 's have been getting inhibitor injections . In general , their pressures have been lowered and kept down , their headaches , chest pains and shortness of breath have disappeared , " their feeling of well-being is evident . " Hypertensives with impaired vision due to blood congestion in the eyes have been greatly improved . <P> " As time has passed , " concluded Dr. Page , " the extracts have become more pure and more potent and the results in the patient have been correspondingly more regular and definite . That arterial blood pressure can be lowered . . . and kept down for months or years seems beyond doubt , but how much ultimate benefit this will be to the patient . . . time and work alone can tell .
