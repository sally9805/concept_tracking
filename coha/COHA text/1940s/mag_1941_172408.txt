In the next secret debate in the House of Commons , Winston Churchill faces a showdown on his conduct of the campaign in Greece . On Sunday he stepped up to a microphone to report to the people of Britain and the U.S. about it and about how the war was going . When he finished , most of the people of both countries were satisfied with Winston Churchill , anyhow . <P> " In their mortal peril , " said a grave and sorrowful Churchill , " the Greeks turned to us for succor . . . . They declared they would fight for their native soil . . . even if we left them to their fate . But we could not do that . There are rules against that kind of thing . . . . An act of shame would deprive us of . . . respect . . . and thus would sap the vitals of our strength . " <P> For the first time Churchill revealed how small were the forces in Egypt from which General Sir Archibald Wavell had to spare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his successive victories could General Wavell . . . bring into action at one time more than two divisions , or about 30,000 men . . . . * We knew of course that the forces we could send to Greece would not by themselves alone be sufficient . " But he had hoped , said Winston Churchill , that Turkey might be drawn in with Greece and Yugoslavia to help meet the German invasion . " How nearly that came off will be known some day . " <P> Then he turned the full force of his scorn on Germany 's partner : " This whipped jackal , Mussolini , who to save his own skin made all Italy a vassal State of Hitler 's Empire , comes frisking up at the side of the German tiger with yelpings not only of appetite . . . but even of triumph . " A realist as always when he meets reversals , Churchill minced no words in describing Britain 's peril . " You know I never try to make out that defeats are victories . . . . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us in the Mediterranean . " <P> Just what those dangers were , not only in the Mediterranean but elsewhere , was all too evident this week . Turkey , already under a German diplomatic attack , soon would have to choose whether to fight a hopeless war or let Nazi troops pass through on their way to the Mosul oil fields . Vichy was under pressure to help Germany in Africa ( see p. 30 ) . Pressure was expected in Spain for help in an attack on Gibraltar , perhaps on Portugal as well . Japan was making bold gestures toward Singapore , where British reinforcements were rushed ( see p. 30 ) . Against all these threats Winston Churchill could only balance the remote chance of acquiring Russia as an ally . Once more he uttered a solemn warning to Joseph Stalin : " The Germans may lay their hands . . . upon the granaries of the Ukraine and the oil wells of the Caucasus . " <P> He reiterated his faith in the war 's outcome . " In order to win this war Hitler must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ocean life line which joins us to the U.S. . . . With every week that passes we grow stronger on the sea . " The real battle confronting Britain , he reminded his hearers , was the Battle of the Atlantic . " We have got to win on salt water just as decisively as we had to win the Battle of Britain last August and September in the air . " And he paid his respects to Franklin Roosevelt , who last week decided to send U.S. Navy patrols to scout the Atlantic .
