CITY LAWYER-Arthur Garfield Hays - Simon &; Schuster ( $3 ) . <P> Lawyer Arthur Garfield Hays exists as an emergency telephone number in the mind of nearly every U.S. radical in trouble with the law . For he is a " chronic , old-fashioned liberal , " and his favorite pets are underdogs . Hays has another telephone number : he is also a shrewd attorney with a penchant for plunking the mandolin out of office hours . <P> City Lawyer is : 1 ) a frank description of how certain lawyers attract trade and win suits ; 2 ) a docket of the civil-liberties cases whereby Lawyer Hays has helped to keep leftists out of jail and himself in the public eye . <P> Arthur Garfield Hays 's first important run-in with the law was almost his last . In 1917 , while Hays was busy being a Red Cross collection agent in the West , his partners , who were then lawyers for the New York Evening Mail , submitted a report to the Alien Property Custodian showing an investment of $100,000 in the Mail by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Mail was receiving German gold . Kaufmann and Lindheim were sentenced to a year in jail , and disbarred . Hays , however , came through unscratched . <P> The " famous debacle " of E. W. Wagner &; Co. ( 1921 ) gave Lawyer Hays " an education in high finance and a practice in the bankruptcy courts . " Wagner &; Co. were called upon by the Board of Governors of the Stock Exchange " to answer for some delinquency in their Fort Wayne , Ind . office . " <P> Millions in It . The firm went into bankruptcy . Indicted by a New York grand jury , Wagner himself " jumped out of a tenth-story window " before trial . The Hays firm came off all right , however . Legal expenses of the bankruptcy proceedings were " over three quarters of a million dollars . " <P> Other profitable Hays legal business included the famed Wendel will case , involving the $50,000,000 fortune of Ella Wendel , the " hermit of Fifth Avenue " ; the Dionne Quintuplets ( " contracts , trademarks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; countless divorce cases . <P> Like a mischievous boy , Lawyer Hays enjoys rattling the dry bones left by many an old battle against Prohibition , censorship , race prejudice , Mayor Hague , and for " Communists , IWWs , evolutionists , birth-controllers , union organizers . . . . " <P> When Hays led his civil-liberties parades against Mayor Frank Hague of Jersey City ( 1938 ) , he met his match . Hays wanted Hague 's police to jail him ( to create an issue ) . Instead , a disobliging cop simply hustled him along the street . Hays " managed to blurt out : ' All right , as long as you push , I 'll go . ' " But there was n't much fun in that . Hays came back a few days later to orate against Hague from the top of an automobile . It was no use . Mayor Hague was too smart to play .
