The officials of conquered France worked like beavers last week . Their apologists swore they were not Fascists , but every effort they launched was calculated to fit their battered rump of a nation into the familiar authoritarian pattern of government by suppression , censorship , alibis , purges . Echoes of " Heads will roll " Hitlerism were heard from Paris to Marseille as the Petain Government announced that onetime Premier Edouard Daladier , onetime Interior Minister Georges Mandel , onetime Navy Minister Cesar Campinchi , onetime Foreign Minister Yvon Delbos and numerous other pre-Petain Government leaders were under arrest and would be tried and punished because " they threw our country into war although they knew we were not ready to fight . " <P> MM . Daladier , Mandel , Campinchi and Delbos had fled from Bordeaux on June 20 on the steamer Massilia , a few days before armistice agreements were concluded with Germany and Italy . Reaching Casablanca , they were held on their ship by Moroccan authorities acting on orders from Bordeaux , to await the Petain Government 's decision . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fellow scapegoats learned that they were the principal victims of a new Government decree withdrawing citizenship and confiscating the property of all citizens who left French territory between May 10 and June 30 without a valid reason . <P> " You have been living on lies , " declared Interior Minister Adrien Marquet to his countrymen in announcing the forthcoming trials as part of an extensive domestic moral purge . " The hour of truth has sounded . . . . The rapidity of our catastrophe upset you and then you sought those responsible . It was useless to hunt widely . . . . The day they come to trial , our dead will sit on the prosecutor 's bench . In the name of justice , those guilty of such political errors and military ignorance will be punished . " <P> Sweet revenge to onetime Dentist Marquet , described as a combination of Huey Long , Don Juan and Hitler , was the purging of Daladier . In 1934 the ex-Premier suggested the possibility of a Cabinet post to Marquet . " I 'll take the Interior or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colleague , " Now that there are a couple of two-fisted men at the helm like Daladier and myself , there is nothing to fear . " He did not get the post , and became anti-Daladier . <P> Feeling his oats last week , Minister Marquet also had advice for America . " Tell America her time is coming unless she wakes up , " he advised foreign pressmen . " In 1932 when I was there , a young man with average intelligence , average brawn and average will to work could have hoped and did hope to amass enough to live comfortably . When I returned in 1939 I was astonished to find American youth no longer wished to work . . . women filling the jobs of men in industry and commerce , wearing too much make-up and refusing to bear children . I warn you . . . it is time for that nation to look to its future and wake up . "
