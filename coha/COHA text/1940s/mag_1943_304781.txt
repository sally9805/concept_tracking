The War Labor Board came right out and said this week that John L. Lewis ' defiance of the Government " gives aid and comfort to our enemies . " The law has a word for giving aid &; comfort to the enemy in time of war . The word is treason . If the Government meant what it said , its next step would be to place John L. Lewis under arrest . <P> Evidently the Government did not mean it . All the ingredients for a full showdown were assembled , but instead of arresting John Lewis , the Government , through another branch ( Harold L. Ickes ) asked Mr. Lewis not to strike against it . Mr. Lewis , with a great show of patriotism , agreed to extend the strike truce till May 31 , sending out 5,000 telegrams over the overburdened telegraph lines to tell his lieutenants the strike was postponed , thus ending two weeks of buildup . <P> First the Government had begun by backtracking . Economic Czar James F. Byrnes had restored to WLB some of the prerogatives taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8 . The Board thus reacquired power to correct " gross inequities " in wages and to make wage adjustments in order to promote " the effective prosecution of the war . " This provided loopholes for concessions to Lewis . It also had strategic value : it silenced the cries of A.F. of L. and C.I.O. against the hold-the-line order and realigned them on the side of the Government against John Lewis . <P> Then the Board ordered Lewis to resume wage negotiations with the operators under its jurisdiction . Lewis did not obey . Finally this week , 60 hours before his self-imposed strike deadline , he made a flat refusal . <P> At this the Board came out with its accusation of giving aid &; comfort to the enemy : " The issue now confronting the nation in this dispute is whether Mr. Lewis is above and beyond the laws which apply to all other citizens . . . . Mr. Lewis is defying the lawfully established procedures of the Government of the United States . This is not only a defiance of our laws , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the working out of a new mine contract by orderly , peaceful procedure . . . . " <P> John L. Lewis had been playing with fire but the Government had been playing with John L. Lewis . It looked as if John Lewis was the more dangerous to play with .
