Lives &; Loves <P> Henry Ford &; Wife Clara celebrated their 58th anniversary at home . Their favorite versions of how it all started : Henry : " A case of love at first sight . " Clara : " It was n't , for me ; he made absolutely no impression on me at the time . " <P> Tommy Manville , 52 , got a birthday greeting after his own heart , from his eighth &; current wife : a full page in the New Rochelle Standard-Star , bearing a picture of himself , the legend , " Happy Birthday , Tommy Manville " ( in big letters ) , " from Georgina " ( in small letters ) . <P> Barbara Hutton , thrice-married* dime-store heiress , boarded a plane for a month 's junket to Paris and London , explained with more candor than discernment why she would never marry again : " You ca n't go on being a fool forever . " <P> Count Alfred de Marigny , acquitted in 1943 of the unsolved Bahamas murder of his father-in-law , wealthy Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ More Devil Than Saint ( Bernard Ackerman ; $3 ) . Half the book concerns the murder and trial ( De Marigny wants the case reopened ) ; the other half mostly tells how he " walked in and out of the lives of many women . . . . " Sample aphorisms : " In Europe women take good manners for granted . In America they take them to bed " ; " It is no effort to make American women happy . " Characteristic anecdotes : how De Marigny picked up Brenda Frazier in a hotel grill ( he made her come to his table ) ; how De Marigny beat the Duke of Windsor 's time with Madeleine Carroll . <P> <P> Transients <P> Lady Astor , facing a group of reporters in Washington , faced a sudden situation : one of her nylons let go . The indomitable Viscountess , explaining chattily that she kept her stockings loose " so they would n't tear , " stepped behind a desk , quickly pulled herself together , carried on . <P> Bernard M. Baruch , whose fair-weather office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was back on the bench , but this time in Manhattan 's Central Park . The U.S. representative to U.N . ' s Atomic Energy Commission conducted Visitor Franklin D. Roosevelt Jr . to it , observed : " Oh , oh-someone 's taken the office . " But the woman with the baby carriage moved away . <P> The Duke of Hamilton , 43 , headed home after a U.S. business trip and a visit to his old Oxford pal , New York State Boxing Commissioner , Eddie Eagan . The business : getting a new transatlantic air service under way . Once an amateur boxer of note , the greying , fiddle-fit Lord said he rarely put on the gloves any more - last time was about a year ago , with one of his two small sons . Did he want them to be boxers ? Said the noncommittal Duke : they could be whatever they wanted to be . <P> Frank Sinatra found a fine refuge from bobby-soxers : a U.N . Security Council meeting . " The Voice " attended in peace with Sculptor Jo Davidson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some picture-taking later : Sinatra and his big bow tie ( his wife makes them for him ) did n't look half so much like a heart-leaping popular idol as 63-year-old Davidson and his little one ( see cut ) . <P> <P> Bouquets for the Living
