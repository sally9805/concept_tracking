txt Mayor O'Dwyer confirmed yesterday that he was considering a program of new city taxes including levies on amusements , on admissions and betting at race tracks , and on daily rentals of hotel rooms costing more than $2 . He said that a proposal to tax resicientral and non-resraentrai rentals had been under consideration but was no longer a part of the program . Bills for the new taxes will be submitted to the Legislature , probably over the week-end , the Mayor added . The Mayor told of his tentative tax program at a press conference in his office which Controller Lazarus Joseph also attended . Reporters had made an appointment to see Mr. Joseph at 5 P. M. in his office in the Municipal Building because of published reports that the Mayor and the Controller were at odds on the city 's fiscal policies . Shortly before 5 o'clock , Mr. Joseph appeared at City Hall and went into the Mayor 's office . And soon the press was summoned . Commenting on the Controller 's presence , the Mayor said : " Someone has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jo , seph . That 's unfortunate . That 's not true . " Mr. Joseph asserted also that there was no misunderstanding between them and that they have been working together since takjing office . It quickly developed , however , that while the Mayor was no longer looking to the Legislature for further State aid and was working out a new tax program as a way to help meet the city's. need for at least $79,000,000 additional funds next year , the Controller was not committed to any new taxes and was determined to continue to fight for a greater // share of State taxes for-the city . " I have been told we can not count on more State aid , " the Mayor said , " and I Kaye given up the fight ' to get-more . Assuming that we do n't get more State funds , I ca n't wait to the last minute to prepare a tax program . I must do it now . " The fact that Commissioner Robert Moses , who is destined to be Mayor O'Dwyer 's public works coordinator , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moore in Albany on the O'Dwyer tax proposals , while at the same time Mr. Joseph had appeared at a joint . legislative budget committee hearing urging more State aid for the city , had led ' to . conjectures of differences between . Mr. O'Dwyer  --  and Mr. Joseph .. The ' Mayor declared at the press conference that he had not known that Mr. Moses . was going to Albany for that . purpose and that Mr. Moses had- acted on his own initiative , reporting to him later on the conference . He said , however , that he previously had conferred with Mr. Moses and Mr. Moore on the tax program and had had several conferences with Mr. Moses . " Mr. Moses has been very helpful in this matter , and has gone to a lot of trouble to do things for me he need not have done , " the Mayor said . " He 's done that be cause he recognized my plight . I have no objection to his going . In fact , I welcome his-help . I believe he was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Mayor said that in seeking new . taxes to bolster the city 's finances he had chosen the three best men " he knew for the job ? Deputy .

Hotel - Men Tell of Proposal - Details- of the proposed tax on hotel- room rentalt'Came first from a group Of Our - hotel men , Martin Sweeny , ' manager of the Hotel Commodore ; Frank L. Andrews , Manager ' of the Hotel New Yorker ; Frank Krider. of the Martinique and ' Pritrick J. DoUrier of the HO- , tel St. George , Brooklyn . After a brief conference with the Mayor they said the proposal was to place a tax of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rooms renting for more than $2 . They estimated there are about 66,000 rooms out of a total of 80,000 hotel rooms renting ' at ' more than $2 . The hotel men said it was their understanding the tax would - be paid by permanent as well as transient guests . They declared the tax would be " discriminatory " and would tend to prevent hotels from getting conventions to come to the city . The Mayor later said the question of applying the tax to permanent hotel residents was under study . In his part of the interview Controller Joseph recalled that he had disagreed with the report of ' the Moore Commission setting up new ? allocations of State aid to communities - and that he contended the city was not getting its just share of State revenues . The city will get only $137,000,000 back from an estimated $670,000,000 State revenues in the next fiscal year , although the city will contribute over 60 per cent of the total , the Controller said . The city is entitled to a part of the stock-transfer tax , the utility tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he said . Details Still Awaited Because of the lack of details on the proposed taxes there was little comment from interested groups . James F. Reilly , executive secretary of the League of New York Theatres , Inc. , an organization composed of owners of legitimate theatres , said the league was " very much opposed " to any additional levy on amusements . A new tax added to the 20 per cent Federal tax would create a hardship , he said . Motion-picture theatre officials said they would wait to comment until the amount of the tax was known . Likewise there was no comment on the proposed taxing of race tracks , either by the spokesmen for the five metropolitan tracks or the New York State Racing Commission . Paul Windels , chairman of the Citizens Transit Committee , which campaigns for a self-sustaining rapid transit fare , said the 5-cent subway fare ' wee responsible for the financial mess the city is in . A self-sustaining fare would renove any need for new taxes , and unless the subways are placed on a Iself-sustaining basis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the edge of a precipice , will go overboard . " ? ? Relief Voiced in Albany Special to THE Nroz Yeas TIMES . ALBANY , Feb. 18 -- Democratic legislators were ' greatly relieved tonight to learn that Mayor O'Dwyer had abandoned his re-. quest for power to tax rents and the rental value of owner-occupied buildings in New York City , but the change of attitude at City Hall took Republican members of the Legislature by , surprise . Mr. O'Dwyer s ' revenue needs and the ' tax program he will submit to meet them were the principal subjects of discussion this afternoon at a conference of Republican legislative leaders with Governor Dewey . In view of the withdrawal of the rent tax proposal it was decided to wait until Mr. O'Dwyer submits -a final legislative program before any decisions on it are attempted . The - Mayor may make other changes before the final program is submitted , it was observed . The general attitude of Republican legislative leaders and Governor Dewey is that New York City . needs some .. additional revenues and should receive the power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasonable and do not interfere with State tax collections . Thomas L. J. Corcoran , the city's. legislative representative , arrived in Albany this afternoon with the drafts for several of the city 's tax bills in his brief case . But pending word from City Hall they remained there tonight . There is a general understanding here that Mayor O'Dwyer will submit a detailed program of new taxes , together with a statement ofthe need for them , to legislative leaders later in the week . The Mayor 's letter to the Legislature will be followed by the introduction of the tax bills . In informal discussions of the city 's tax program today . Democratic members of the Legislature reported that the . Mayor had been considering a small payroll tax similar to the one now in use in Philadelphia but had never given it his approval . As discussed , this tax would be levied against ' employers " only and no part of it would be paid by employes . The rate that would be imposed , according to the information here , would be somewhat less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receive from the unemployment insurance contributions under the modjfied merit rating scheme approved by the Legislature last year . Views expressed by Democratic legislators from New York City on their arrival here today made it clear that ' Mayor O'Dwyer would have found it extremely difficult to whip them into line in ' favor of his rent tax if he had not decided to abandon it. - Without knowing the rates involved , . many took the stand that it would be political suicide for them to vote for it .
