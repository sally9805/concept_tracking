txt A determined move by the Soviet Union to establish Big-Three control over the General Assembly of the United Nations  --  and thereby exted the measure of Soviet veto control over the actions of that body  --  was turned down decisively here today by a vote of nine to four . After two days of tense , exciting debate in which both sides came close to victory several times , Great Britain and the United States joined most of the smaller powers in preserving an Assembly which shall be democratic in its procedure . It really was the day of the small powers . After losing earlier in their effort to shake Big-Five control of the Security Council , they stood together in repelling this wholly unexpected raid on the broadly democratic character of the Assembly .

The United Nations Organization today is a fact . Yesterday , following deposit of ratification notices by the Soviet Union , Byelorussia , the Ukraine , and Poland , a sufficient number of nations had accepted the Charter to bring it into being . In a simple ceremony at the Department of State that contrasted strikingly with the colorful and formal affair staged at San Francisco last June when 50 nations signed the Charter , Secretary of State James F. Byrnes signed a protocol of deposit of ratifications . Henceforth , as he said in eloquent briefness , " the United Nations Charter is now a part of the law of nations .

The dispute over Poland 's membership was settled in the meantime and Poland became the 51st member . In two days less than four months after the signing at San Francisco , the new international organization was an established fact . The United States , which ratified the charter on Aug. 8 , was the first nation to accept the new constitution for a world security organization . The Soviet Union , which deposited its ratification shortly after- 3 p. m. yesterday , was the last . At 4:45 , after a very brief statement by Mr. Byrnes and his signing of the protocol , with two pens , the world 's latest experiment in co-operative bring officially began .

Andrei Gromyko , the Soviet delegate , merely asked yesterday that all references to the composition of the'so-called General Commit tee of the Assembly , which is the all-powerful steering committee of the Assembly , be eliminated from the subcommittee report on Assembly mathinery . Mr. Gromyko said that , although he agreed on the functions of this Committee , the time was not yet ripe for deciding on the , composition . He likewise wished that the section forming the nominating cominittee be eliminated and nominations left to the Assembly itself .

He said primary consideration should be given not to individual competence of the members but to " political factors . " UNO Comes Into Being ment but upon what is in the minds and heat ts of men .
