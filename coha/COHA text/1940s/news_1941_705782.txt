txt The Office of Price Administration and Civilian Supply may issue a price schedule for tin in about a week , it was indicated yesterday after OPACS officials met with tin exporters , dealers , brokers and recovery producers . The meeting was described a " exploratory " or the purpose of getting defined what the tin trade generally recognizes as differentials in quality , shipping rates and other factors . Price Administrator Henderson said last week that he considered tin prices , then at 55 cents per pound . too high and warned that further increases might result in a price ceiling . The price has gone up somewhat since - that tume . Price increases , Mr. Henderson explained , would not increase supply because the matter of available tin is almost altogether a shipping question . Mr. Henderson said at the time he issued his warning that he considered the tin price of 50 cents established by the Metals Reserve Corporation to be a fair one .                    @
