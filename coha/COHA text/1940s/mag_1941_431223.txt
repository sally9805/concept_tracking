 | This is not a piece about Frank Sinatra , so the bobbysocks may as well exhale and go back to their juke boxes . I do n't know a thing about Frank Sinatra , and the nearest I ever came to meeting him was in a revolving door . I happened to be leaving a restaurant with a man named Osborne ? who knows Sinatra ? when Mr. Sinatra started to come in . He and Ozzie sighted each other through the glass panels of the revolving door , and they both waved and made signs meaning , " Stay where you are till I get there , I want to see you ! " and then we all got in the revolving door and gave it a smart push , and it whirled us around and deposited Mr. Sinatra inside the restaurant and Ozzie and me outside on the curb . The second time we started for each other the door spewed Ozzie and me into the restaurant and Mr. Sinatra onto the sidewalk . The third or fourth time Sinatra landed outside , a crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had to leave by a side exit to avoid being trampled . So I never got to meet Frank Sinatra . I am not sure just what I would have said to Mr. Sinatra if I had met him ; but if I were nine out of ten people , the chances are that I would have said , " Well , Frankie , still singing , I suppose ? " And that brings us to the subject of this little piece , which concerns the strange things otherwise normal people say to celebrities when they meet them face to face . Have you noticed it ? I do n't know what mental lull comes over ordinarily coherent citizens in the presence of fame , but I do know ? from observation and from a few wistful comments by the renowned victims themselves ? that people will break their necks to meet a celebrity and then , still panting with the pleasure of it all , will get off some of the most curious greetings you ever heard . Like asking Frank Sinatra whether he is still singing . People @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that of course he is still singing . That is , if he still likes to eat , he 's still singing . Famous writers get a variation of this question . " Are you writing anything now ? " admirers swarm up eagerly to ask them . This is exactly like asking the Telephone Company or the Pennsylvania Railroad whether it is still in business . You 're darn ' right the famous writers are " writing something now , " and always , to pay the rent and the groceries and the dentist 's bill for that back tooth that starts to ache the minute they sit down at a typewriter . Writers are an earthy crew ; they have toothaches like anybody else , they go to sleep with cigarettes and burn the blankets , and sleep uneasy and tear the sheets , which is hard on the laundry . And like Frank Sinatra , they like to eat . All these hard facts explain their stricken look when someone tizzies up to them out of the blue and burbles , " Are you writing anything now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do you write every day or do you just wait for the inspiration ? " When an author waits for anything , it 's for a check , not for inspiration . And when the poor wretch 's check arrives , it is likely to be a very small one if it 's in payment of royalties . Do you know why , chums ? Because of still another loving greeting from his warmhearted fans . This one goes : " Oh , I just love your book . I 've lent it to everybody I know ! I bet I 've lent my one copy about twenty times ! " This means that the author will receive a royalty on one copy instead of royalties on the twenty-one copies that might have been bought if the one copy had not been so freely lent . But writers do n't mind that , really . They are so hungry for praise that they would almost ? almost ? rather have it than money . What does bother them , I think , is the greetings from strangers that imply either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard a man newly introduced to Somerset Maugham say : " This is a great honor , Mister Moggam . I 'm always telling the wife that my favorite book is Main Street . " Possibly at the same time another cloud-brain was telling Sinclair Lewis that his favorite book was Of Human Bondage . Writers do n't care much for the kind of infatuation that makes people forget what they wrote . Another type of satellite they can do without is the lady who wags a finger at them and squeals , " Now , do n't you dare put me in your next novel ! " Perhaps the number one headache , though , is the daisy who , observing that a writer 's work appears spasmodically , concludes that it drops ready-made from heaven , and says , " What do you do with yourself betweentimes ? " What does anyone think a writer does between the appearance of one piece of work and the next one ? ride on the carrousels ? The greeters , the boys and girls who are always there with the peculiar remarks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as on artistes . My father , who runs a hotel in New York , has had trouble that way . For some reason , people think that because he is in the hotel business he must be interested in the hotel business , and when strangers are introduced to him , they usually say , " Now , Mr. Case , I have a friend who runs a little inn up in the Alleghenies , and he told me ? " Then comes  | something pretty long about overhead or teapots or how to cook macaroni . Father , whose interests lie mainly in books and the theatre ? although his own hotel is dear to his heart ? listens beautifully , but soon begins cracking his ankle , a signal that one of the family , or a bellboy or somebody , must rescue him . Father 's anklecracking can be heard all over the lobby , and on a quiet day as far as the second floor . Well , once an old friend called him up and asked him to come to tea . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Inn , " she said . Father accepted , since they were such old friends , and kicked himself until the day of the party , muttering about old bores who bought old country inns and expected him to be interested in them . He went to the tea , though , and discovered that the guest of honor was Admiral Fenard , the heroic French naval officer who had brought the S. S. Montcalm into New York Harbor after a journey through perilous seas . What Old Family Friend had said on the telephone , of course , was not that she wanted Papa to meet a man who had bought the Montcalm Inn , but the man who had brought the Montcalm in . After that , Father went simply everywhere , being afraid to miss a single thing . Actresses , perhaps more than anyone , often reel under the impact of wellmeant greetings from strangers . " Why ! " the 170-pound lady will exclaim , knocking everybody flat to get to a star and shake her by the hand . " I remember my mother 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lit-tul girl ! " She really thinks she remembers it , and maybe she does , at that . What escapes her is the fact that , although she may have been sixteen when she first saw this actress , the actress may very well have been sixteen , too , or younger . Elsie Janis , Marilyn Miller , Ina Claire , Mitzi Green , and dozens of other girls were starred before they were sixteen , and the world is full of grandmas who want to meet such actresses and remind them how long they have been on the stage , but who never , never , under any circumstances , dream of saying to them , " How much better you 've kept your looks than I have , dear ! " In this connection I always think of Miss Ethel Barrymore , who was starred in Captain Jinks when she was twenty , being approached not long ago by an  | elderly wolf who handed her the usual nosegay about having seen her when he vas a lit-tul boy , and then asked , " May I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Miss Barrymore thrummed at him in her famous voice . " Why not just call me Toots ' ? " I also remember Tallulah Bankhead 's reply to a female flathead who said she remembered seeing Tallulah when they were both seventeen and when Tallu 's hair was a glorious golden color ? " Not mouse-colored , the way it is now , " this character added , with an incredible lack of charm . " My good woman , " Miss Bankhead intoned dangerously , If you can show me a mouse the color of my hair , I will gladly give you both kennel-room on my farm in Fairfield . " All the people in show business are lacerated , probably more than anyone else , by the fond , unforgivable greetings of unknown admirers . Here are a few : To an actress ? holding her at arm 's length and gazing at her tenderly : " How wonderful to meet you at last ! I 'll never forget how lovely you were in that play ? what was the name of it now ? ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name of a play , but they -. ever , never forget a date . ) To a composer ? say , Richard Rodgers : Oh , of course the music of Oklahoma ! and Carousel is simply lovely , but when are you going to write another song like My Heart Stood Still ? " To a lyric-writer ? say , Oscar Hammerstein : " You mean you wrote the words all the songs from Oklahoma ! and Show Boat and all those things ? Why , that 's fascinating ! I mean , you sort of never think about the words of a popular song . All you remember is the tune . " To a playwright : " No , I have n't seen our new play yet , but I do n't care how good it is , nothing could ever come up to that very first one you wrote back in 1920 when you were just out of college . " THE business of greeting Hollywood celebrities is quite another cup of tea ? or beaker of poison , depending on how you look at it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hollywood etiquette . Social strictures are so rigid among picture people that you can please or displease a movie celebrity without opening your mouth ? merely by standing up or sitting down , or failing to do either . in other communities throughout the United States , for example , it is not unusual for a gentleman to walk across a room to pay his respects to a lady of his acquaintance . In Hollywood , however , nobody crosses a room to speak to anyone else unless the other person is sufficiently important . You do not expect ? no matter who you are , you can not ? Louis B. Mayer , President of MetroGoldwyn-Mayer and long enshrined as the King of Hollywood , to take two steps to say hello to you . You find out where Mayer is , and you go to him . Since Hollywood is full of people who consider themselves just a little more important than the next one , social gatherings in the picture colony often consist of little rows of people standing against a wall , each one doggedly waiting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room to shake hands . This may be one reason Hollywood is such a Paradise for celebrity hunters , who , of course , do all the running and would gladly cross a room , patio , swimming pool , or mountain peak to get an autograph or a kind word .
