HIGH DIVER STORY BY JOHN ASHWORTH O N MOST nights , folks would stroll up and down the midway and spend money at the concessions until the last and only free event of the carnival . At midnight Daredevil Rinaldi would climb the one-hundred-and-ten-foot steel ladder ; pause to catch his breath and to say , " Holy Mary , have pity on me " ; and take a forward somersault into a tank of water four feet deep . Then folks would go home . On this night , ten minutes after twelve and no Daredevil Rinaldi ! The crowd was impatient . " Come on in . The water 's fine , " yelled a rasping voice . Somebody guffawed , and somebody whooped . A baby squawled . Giggling , the mother pitched a pink twist of cotton candy into the water . Then the band played " The Missouri Waltz , " softly and mysteriously . In stately rhythm the Great Rinaldi climbed to a tiny platform in front of the musicians . There he waited to be introduced , arms folded , head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in pale orange tights and purple satin trunks and helmet . His red-brown face , with its fleshy nose and ridges of hard muscle over cheeks and chin and into his neck , looked like hammered copper . In the . quiet after the waltz , crickets chirped . A couple of men took off their hats . " Deacon " McCallister , owner of the carnival , stood on a stepladder behind the tank and addressed the crowd . He wore a black tight-fitting suit in which his tall bony frame made unexpected humps . His cadaverous face was framed by concentric U-shaped folds of skin around his chops , as though he had been modeled with long squeezed-out rolls of plasticine . " Ladies and gentlemen . You are about to witness the climax of the McCallister Carnival . . . The handsome figure of a man before you will climb the one-hundred-and-tenfoot ladder . . He will plunge down in his world-famous , death-defying forward somersault . . . We are asking for absolute silence . . . " Listening , people stared at the Daredevil and waited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , proclaimed , " I give you Daredevil Rinaldi , " the crowd gasped . The star performer 's coppery face had softened , and his full lips slobbered . Crumpling to the floor of the platform , he began to snore . He was very drunk . After the Daredevil was helped to his trailer ; after the Deacon apologized to the jeering crowd ; after the tank was well lined and sprinkled with pop bottles , ice cream cups , gum wrappers , and the little squares of wax paper that go around hot dogs  --  Stanley Nalawack wandered around the trailer camp of the carnival and asked a workman , " Hey , Bud , where can I find Mr. McCallister ? " A stocky youth with short thick arms and legs , Stanley wore a ragged football jersey , baggy trousers , and sneakers . His body had the toughness of crude rubber . In fact , his nickname was " Chunk " . He had a wide pale face , low forehead , snub nose , and straight yellow-brown hair . His thin lips did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , precisely  --  and showed small teeth like a child 's first set . His gray eyes were searching , worried , lonely ; and a deep hen 's track of creases always appeared between them as he said his favorite words : " Aw , for Christ 's sake , listen to me , will you ? " The door of the Deacon 's trailer was open to the Indian summer night . Hesitating , Stan stood in the wedge of light and peered inside . Seated under an imitation ship 's lantern at a drop-leaf table , the Deacon was sorting coins . A gray-haired woman leaned against some needlework cushions on the lower bunk and knitted . Stan knocked . The Deacon rose and strode to the door , his long body and limbs weaving around the jutting corners of built-in furniture and cupboards . " Do you want a diver ? " Stan 's voice was loud and forced . " Who 're you ? " " Stanley Nalawack . I live here . I can dive . " The Deacon drew him into the trailer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He thumped down a seat on hinges against the wall . Mrs. McCallister kept her hard , birdlike eyes on Stan as she commented to the Deacon , " Just an ordinary stiff . " " Now , Mary , " said the owner of the carnival ; fingering the folds of his chops . " Tell me about yourself , Stanley . " " I know how to dive . I 've took somersaults off the rocks up in the quarry . I would n't be scared to go off the ladder . Is it true you pay Daredevil Rinaldi fifty dollars a dive ? " Husband and wife looked at each other . " Well , " said the Deacon , " that 's a mite exaggerated . I ca n't pay no such figure as that . I 'm just an everyday , ordinary business man . " " How much do you pay ? Just how much ? " " Twenty-five dollars . " " A hundred and twenty-five or a hundred and fifty a week , " said Stan . " That 's a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a grin she added , " Do you suppose you could land in the tank and stay in one piece ? " " If you want a diver , I can do it , " said Stan . " What 's this quarry like ? " asked the Deacon . " High rocks . Deep water . " " How high ? " . " The highest is forty feet . " " Forty feet is a lot different from a hundred and ten . And deep water is a lot different from a tank with four feet . " " Getting paid is a lot different from doing it for nothing . " The Deacon stood up . " Naw , I wo n't let you risk your neck , sonny . You ai n't a professional . " " Do n't be hasty , Mac , " said the lady . " My God , " exclaimed the Deacon , looking fearfully at his wife , " we ca n't let the young fellow hurt himself . " Stan 's forehead creased . " Listen to me , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knitted , her eyes on her work . " How old are you ? " asked the carnival owner quietly . " Twenty-one , " said Stan , adding a year to his life . " Well , you ai n't a minor anyway , " said the Deacon . " I tell you what I 'll do . I 'll go up to the quarry with you first thing in the morning , if you still want the job . You can show me your act . " Mrs. McCallister smiled . " You got a good chance , young man . We 'd just as soon have you if you 're any good . Rinaldi ai n't dependable . Every day embalmed . Gives us a bad name . " " Be here at half-past seven , " said the Deacon . " Sure . Thanks , " said Stan , and walked out . " Good night , young man , " called Mrs. McCallister pleasantly , her needles quiet . Then she spitted her ball of yarn savagely and turned to her husband . TAN ran all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt fierce and free . That night , however , lying on the army cot in his room , he imagined that his sprawling body missed the tank and hurtled to death . He felt broken arms and ribs and legs as he struck the rim , and burning organic injuries . An old cripple , Crazy Doody , wandered around town , a hunched-up shoulder against an ear , one leg jerking loosely with every step , a thick tongue droning incoherent vowels . Crazy Doody kept alive by selling newspapers . Stan saw himself thus . Then he slept and dreamed of gliding bravely , with a billow-ing splash , into the exact middle of the tank , which was full of blood . Just before eight o'clock the next morning , the Deacon and Stan drove into a hard , sun-baked pasture on the rim of the quarry . Unfolding from his small black sedan , the Deacon stood and looked into a great bowl two hundred yards across with sheer orange granite sides from twenty to forty feet high . The bottom was filled with green-black water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go swimming ? " " Been here all my life , " said Stan . Throwing off pants , jersey , and sneakers , he stood in red trunks on the peak of the ledge . " I done a lot of dives from here . I can do a forward somersault . A forward one-and-a-half . A gainer . Of course I can do jack-knifes and swans . What d' you want to see ? " " Do your front somersault . Land on your feet . You ai n't going to do no front-first dives into the tank . " Stan extended his arms , balanced carefully a moment , and sprang out over the water . His legs together and straight , he bent at the hips , turned over easily and perfectly during the long drop , and cut into the water , feet first . The splash echoed from the opposite cliff . " Well ! " said the Deacon , " maybe the young fellow can do it after all . " Stan came to the surface and spouted water . " Okay ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coldly , concealing his enthusiasm . " Do a couple of tricks now so I can see if you got timing . " As Stan was again poised on the ledge , a whistle blew two miles away in Whitneyville . He laughed . " Eight o'clock , " he remarked . " That 's the mill . " Then he flung himself out into a gainer . This dive particularly , with its appearance of suicidal abandon against the background of orange granite and metallic water , convinced the Deacon that Stan was crazy enough to dare anything . Moreover , the long gliding swoop from an apparently helpless position on his back forty feet up , like a surrender to space , seemed to show the natural diver 's subtle control of his body . " That 's enough , " said the owner of the carnival , as Stan climbed up from thewater . " I 'm for you . Now I want you to talk to Rinaldi . He might be willing to give you a couple of pointers if you do n't let on you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think it 's for a couple of nights , until he gets over his drunk . " Stan nodded , showing his teeth . A -r THE Daredevil 's trailer , the Deacon knocked and entered immediately , Stan after him . The place smelled of whiskey and like the wet shower room of an old gymnasium . On the grimy rubber floor before the tiny gasoline stove , a chartreuse necktie was soaking in a puddle of maple syrup . A haggard platinum blonde , leaning her elbows on the dresser , apathetically plucked her eyebrows . Rinaldi himself sprawled in sweaty pajamas on the tousled bedding of the lower bunk . " How do you feel , Mr. Rinaldi ? " asked the Deacon . The Daredevil glared . " What 're you coming around here for ? " His voice was low but excited and operatic . " You bird of death . You sucker of blood .. . " The plasticine folds around the Deacon 's chops quivered as he smiled . " You 're a card , Mr. Rinaldi . " The Daredevil lolloped over and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of business I want to talk over with you this morning , " the Deacon suggested . Rinaldi snorted . " This is Stanley Nalawack , " continued the Deacon . " He 's going to take your place , just for a couple of nights . . . " Abruptly Rinaldi flopped to the edge of his bunk . His great brown eyes , bloodshot and dilated between their sticky wrinkled lids , glowed at Stan . Then he punched out a blunt finger at the Deacon , who recoiled . " Murderer ! What are you doing ? He 's just a boy . What do you think ? You think you make money ? You think you paper the insides of your trailer with dollar bills ? You think you pull out a roll and buy the dirty little things your dirty little heart wants ? You toad ! You . . . " " Now , now , " murmured the Deacon , " we did n't come here to excite you , Mr. Rinaldi . The young fellow wo n't be hurt if you coach him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diving . " " A fancy diver ? Not even an acrobat ? " Rinaldi turned to Stan savagely . " Ever been in the circus ? " Startled , Stan shook his head . " Madman ! " the Daredevil cried at the Deacon , then hammered out some curses in Italian and English . When he was tired , he fell back on the bunk and delivered himself of the reason the young fellow could never hope to take his place : " Circus blood ! Generations of circus blood ! Ever hear of the Flying Rinaldis ? " Stan shrugged . Rinaldi spread his arms in tragic sorrow . " Not even cultured ! " he shrieked . " What does he know ? What can he know ? " To Stan he muttered , " When I was less than a year old , I knew more about timing than I knew about walking . When I was four , I could do back bends , flip-flops , hand stands , and backwards and forwards somersaults , I felt the little , little , little bit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet or on your butt . Blood , blood .. . that 's what it is  --  blood ! " " I do n't know anything about that , " said the Deacon . " I came here to talk business . " " My mother was a Hammerworth , " proclaimed Rinaldi . He sat up again and held out his cupped hand as though he would tenderly support Stan 's chin . " Look , you are a nice young fellow . You got big chest and strong arms and plenty muscles . Why would you want to break your neck ? " " Listen . . . " began Stan . Rinaldi hushed him with a grandiloquent wave of hairy forearms . " How do you know what it is like on top of a hundred-and-ten-foot ladder ? Have you ever been up there ? No ? I will tell you . It is to be all alone up there . And all the little faces down on the ground , like little bugs waiting to be squashed , they see you die , they hope . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just a little , little with your toes when you leave the platform . Then you go over the tank and  --  unh-nh . . " Loose-jowled , Rinaldi grunted to show a body hitting the ground from a hundred and ten feet . " You say : tip a little , little this way ; tip a little , little that way . . , " " Aw , for Christ 's sake , listen to me , will you ? " said Stan . " I pity you , " continued Rinaldi without a break . " I pity you from the bottom of my heart . Suppose you twist yourself for good . Suppose you bash your insides out on the rim of the tank . " The Daredevil contorted his body and /oiled out a pulpy tongue to illustrate . " Look , my poor fellow , you have a sweetheart , no ? " " Naw , " said Stan . " Let the punk break his neck if he wants to , " said the blonde . The men gazed at her as though a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " This is a hell of a way to live anyway , " she said to the Daredevil . " What 're you trying to keep it up for ? " Rinaldi grimaced , his lips rolling back over his teeth . " Nice feathers for my pretty bird . . . " " To hell with all that ! " Turning to the Deacon , she snarled , " Just take your thirty-five dollars a dive and . . . " " Thirty-five ! He told me twenty-five , " blurted Stan . " Twenty-five is all I 'll pay , " snapped the Deacon . " Take it or leave it ! " " Get out of here , " said the blonde . " Take Junior with you . " The Deacon hesitated , then wove around the cupboard doors and left . Frowning , Stan followed . The Daredevil bounded from his bunk and , outside the trailer , clutched Stan 's arm . " Listen , I tell you one thing . When you are on your way down , and you have turned over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want to turn your head to look . Do n't . You twist and hurt yourself . You want to bend to make sure you turn over . Do n't . You turn way over and land flat and bust yourself . All right . You can have the job . Pm through . God help you . " Shaking his head , the Great Rinaldi muttered , " Twenty-five dollars ! " Then he stomped back into his trailer . The Deacon simpered as he pulled out a huge wallet . " Here , " he said , handing Stan five ten-dollar bills , " here 's an advance on your pay . " Stan eyed the money for a moment , then tried to appear casual as he put it into his hip pocket . " When Rinaldi was first diving , " continued the Deacon , " he did some practice jumps from about thirty feet on the ladder , just to get used to landing in the tank . Maybe you ought to try a couple this morning . " A r THE tank , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sneakers , climb the ladder . It consisted of ten-foot steel sections . When Stan reached the top of the third section , he turned around and looked down . " Good-by , cruel world , " he yelled mockingly . Then he waved and stepped off . The hard jolt of landing in the canvas bottom of the tank surprised him . But he did n't think about what the jolt would have been if he had fallen from a hundred and ten feet . A carnival girl with sulphur-colored hair was standing next to the tank , and Stan condescendingly splashed some water toward her . She squealed and shook her skirt . " My , " she drawled , with a languid Southern accent , " you sure are one crazy man ! " " How about tonight , Babe ? " he said loudly , so that everyone could hear . She giggled . " Think it over , " he remarked . Without waiting for her reply , he mounted the ladder again . When he reached the third section , he kept going . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go any higher . You 'll sprain an ankle or something . Tonight we 'll tape you up . " Stan had intended to go up forty feet . But the Deacon 's warning was like a dare , which he could never resist . He continued to fifty feet . Looking down , he was a little surprised that the ground seemed so much further away . The tank was quite small . But without hesitation he stepped off the ladder . Although he was more ready for the jolt when he hit the canvas , his breath was squeezed out , and he felt sharp aching yanks in his ankles and thighs . He stood still and gasped before he lunged to the rim and pulled himself out . His legs were numb and shaking . " If you 're going to practice from that high up , you ought to be taped , " said the Deacon . " I 'll tape you up tonight so you ca n't feel nothing , so you ca n't feel nothing at all . " Stan refused to think about tonight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girl with the sulphur-colored hair . She was ambling away . " To hell with you , " he muttered . After telling him to be on hand by ten o'clock , the Deacon loped off . TAN had the day to himself . Strolling along Whitneyville 's Main Street , he turned into a dry goods store . He bought and put on a zipper-front brown sweater with suede trimmings , brown tweed trousers , moccasins , and thick white woolen socks . He took a rabbit 's foot from his old pants and carefully buttoned it into the left hip pocket of his new ones . Although this good luck charm was just a joke , he planned to take it with him up the ladder . Into his right hip pocket he stuffed a new jock strap . Finally he tossed his discarded clothes on the counter and said , " Burn ' em up . " For several hours , he loafed on street corners , consumed ice cream sodas , and shot some pool . An auto salesman heard of his new job and gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle of the afternoon , he walked to Parker 's Field , a stretch of weeds and hard-packed dirt between some stunted woods and the Whitney Woolen Corporation , the gridiron of the Whitneyville Steamrollers . With an announcement that he would n't be able to play left-half any more , he refereed a practice scrimmage . No one argued his decisions . When the scrimmage was over , and while the players were changing into street clothes , Stan lounged on the bench . Suddenly loneliness and terror blotted out his surroundings , and he daydreamed his own death . His body was naked and white on a black couch . Four girls , their faces obscure but fresh and dewy , laid roses on his chest . His dead heart bled from the prick of thorns . He felt soft flesh and a rush of heat that was quickly sickened by fear . When " Chief " Kojowski spoke to him , Stan stared blankly at though he had never seen his friend before . " Going to town , Chunk ? " repeated Chief . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian 's . Next to Chief stood " Satchel-butts " Brown , his flabby , half-open mouth for once speechless . As they walked , no one mentioned the dive . They talked more quietly than usual . Satchel-butts , whose conversation was generally dirty , uttered pure , almost reverent platitudes . Stan felt angry and helpless . He tried to tell obscene stories , but floundered . Finally , mentioning casually the advance of fifty dollars , he took them into a restaurant-bar and treated them to pork chops and beer . While they were eating , a sound truck parked outside and bellowed : " Come to the carnival . . . McCallister 's Carnival will this evening present a Whitneyville young man , Stanley Nalawack , in the death-defying somersault . . . " The truck made the announcement three times and roared away . " How d' you like that ? " asked Stan , serious and aggressive . After their meal , he remarked , " I met a girl at the carnival  --  did you see the Musical Revue ? " Chief had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellow hair ? She had a pink brassiere . " Satchel-butts leered wisely . " I 'm getting to know her pretty well , " lied Stan . " I guess the Daredevil can have any girl he wants . " " Sure , " said Satchel-butts soberly . Chief smiled , embarrassed . " Come on , " said Stan . " Let 's go down to the carnival . " The midway was in full swing under electric lights . They played bat-the-ball , punched a bag , shot clay ducks , and scrutinized Henry-Henriette . " Aw hell , you do n't need to spend all your money on us , " protested Chief . " I can get plenty more , " said Stan . He had over sixteen dollars left and suddenly wanted to buy a present for his mother . So they walked from one concession to another and gravely considered the choices . Stan bought a pocket knife with bottle opener , can opener , screw driver , chisel , and wrenches for three sizes of small bolts for Chief ; and a bullet-shaped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finally , among some red wool gorillas and Italian bedspreads , Stan spotted a Venus de Miloreflector lamp . The goddess was shapely in pink glass that glowed under a canopy of variegated green plastic and bronze . It cost $9.59 . With the lamp under one arm , Stan headed for the Deacon 's quarters . S TANDDM before the trailer was his father . His heavy face , the mouth concealed by the bushy mustache of an old fashioned Slav , showed no emotion . " What 're you doing here ? " asked Stan . " I heard the sound truck , " said his father . Stan was silent . The whole accumulation of the day 's fears , hates , and wishes for a moment seemed to be spent . He felt like saying , " All right . I 'll go with you . " Then his father spoke very low . " Come on home . " Stan saw that he would have to decide all over again between the old life and the new . " I got a job , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said his father . " That 's crazy . You 'll break your neck . " " I done a lot of stunts , and I ai n't never broke it yet , " remarked Stan . Impatient and angry-sounding , his father raised his voice . " Come on home . " " No , I got a job . I ai n't going to work in the mill . " " I worked in the mill . " " All right . You came from the old country and did n't know the language . I do n't have to work in the mill . " " You 'll kill your mother ! " shouted his father , suddenly losing all restraint . " No , I wo n't , " said Stan , and then , with arrogant superiority , " I 'm going to buy her stuff she never had before . " He held out the Venus de Milo reflector lamp . " Here . I bought this . Take it to Mother for me . " The unspoken words were : I may not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big cheekbones taut , his thin lips smiling , Stan watched his father suffer . The old man 's eyes were wet , but his face was like iron . After a moment , he silently took the lamp . They looked at each other , the father beaten but impassive , the son triumphant . Then Stan waved casually at Chief and Satchel-butts , strode to the door of the McCallister 's trailer , and knocked . The Deacon let him in ' Spread out on the bunk were white tights and scarlet trunks and helmet . " These are for you , " said the owner of the carnival . " I think they 'll fit . Rinaldi used to wear them , but they shrank in the laundry . " The Deacon also had yards of tape and a razor . Stan shaved his legs and belly . The Deacon shaved his back . Then he helped Stan bind his ankles , back , and abdomen with adhesive . " I know how Rinaldi put on the tape , " he chattered . " Rinaldi used to own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year . I figured he would n't last in the business . " Then the Deacon gave instructions in showmanship . As Stan dressed , he again felt an impulse to run home . But at that moment he glanced in the mirror over the dresser and scarcely recognized himself . The scarlet helmet adhered to the contours of his head and accented the width of his cheekbones and jaw . His gray eyes glared toughly . The tights made his thick arms and legs seem even thicker , but at the same time graceful and supple . He saw himself briefly as a miraculous comic book hero  --  soaring through the sky , diving into the depths of the ocean . .. . At five minutes before twelve , the Deacon said , " All right . It 's time . " He opened the door of the trailer and stepped out into the dark . T HE carnival was roaring hysterically . The gasoline engine of the ferris wheel sputtered . Red , white , and blue cardboard horns honked . The crowd buzzed erratically . A number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " We 're with you , boy . " The band leader was primed for the Deacon 's appearance and struck up " The Missouri Waltz . " In rhythm , Stan mounted the portable steps to the exhibition platform and stood , rigid and silent , as he had several times watched Daredevil Rinaldi stand . In the garish light of the naked bulbs strung about the tank , Stan 's cheeks were ghastly white , his lips from a little distance almostinvisible , and his whole face flat , depersonalized . Close to the tank , Satchel-butts muttered , " That do n't look like him . " " He 's scared , " said Chief . " Yeah . " On the edge of the crowd stood Stan 's father . When a fellow worker in the mill spoke to him , he did not answer . The muscles of his face drawn and stiff , he stood quietly and waited , the pink glass Venus in his arms like a baby . A hush spread down the midway . The wooden canopies over the fronts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slammed . The ferris wheel engine sputtered out . The honk of a horn was lone and haunted . The members of the band felt the unusual tension , and " The Missouri Waltz " tootled to a breathless halt . The Deacon 's voice was nasal and aggressive . " Ladies and gentlemen ! The McCallister Carnival takes great pride in introducing For the final act of this evening 's entertainment a talented local young man . In just a moment the sturdy athlete before you will climb the one-hundredand-ten-foot ladder . . . " As the Deacon 's voice ground along , Stan was almost the only person there who was not aware of his own fear . He was too angry at the people . Risking his life to give them a thrill ! . his first dive , his first bout with death , " shouted the Deacon , with a fury that covered his uncertainty . He began to stammer . Drawing his handkerchief from his pocket , he wiped the sweat from his face ; and in the middle of this gesture , he glanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her face was composed , her eyes pitiless . " Introduce him , " she mouthed . The Deacon gestured grandly toward his protege . " So , " he barked , " I give you ? Stanley Nalawack . " The crowd applauded feebly , the band swung into " Pomp and Circumstance , " and Stan began to climb the ladder . A voice called , " Good luck , Chunk . " Stan scarcely knew what he was doing until he was halfway up . Then he noticed that he was climbing into the night . The glow of the carnival lights became fainter , and the lights of Whitneyville outlined the pattern of streets . The ladder quivered slightly as he climbed , the steel uprights and guy wires vibrating like a great instrument . As the sound of the music became fainter , Stan had the impression that the band was marching away from him , that all the people were marching away from him , and leaving him alone . The top of the ladder curved over like an inverted " J " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from which he would plunge . He stood on the platform and felt his legs tremble . Remembering a detail of the Deacon 's instructions , he drew a tiny silk handkerchief from the sleeve of his tights and held it out over the water . It fluttered slowly . A fake wind test . The crowd sighed . The handkerchief drifted off into the dark . " Take your time , " the Deacon had said . Stan had climbed the ladder and made the dive so many times in imagination that he still felt no fear . He seemed to be doing his accustomed work . Looking of over the town , he saw the spire of the Congregational Church its tip level with his eyes  --  alternately flash red and fade out . He heard the bleat of cars from Main Street and from the country roads , and he smelled the moist cool acid of withering autumn leaves . With proud detachment he observed the black rectangle of the mill and its few dim lights for the watchman . He particularly noted the stars . Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond the carnival lights , they seemed large and close , closer than the people below . With a start of dismay , he discovered that he did n't have his rabbit 's foot . Listening to the Deacon 's instructions , he had forgotten to take it from the pocket of his new pants . For a moment , he thought of climbing down the ladder to get it . But that would n't look so good ! Everybody would say he was scared . On the ground , a hysterical angry voice shouted , " jump ! " A few people said , " sh-sh . . . " Someone said , " Shut up ! " " Jump ! " the voice shouted again . Stan felt like throwing himself wildly into space , and then saw that he had responded to what he thought the crowd wanted , just as Rinaldi had predicted . Or did he respond only because Rinaldi had said he would ? " Damn Rinaldi , " he muttered indifferently . The crowd was a thick crescent of pale , upturned faces around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cruel . . . Angrily he thought of the mill , the Deacon , the girl with the sulphur-yellow hair . . . . He thrust back the thought of his mother , his father , the lamp . ... Suddenly , he knew that Stanley Nalawack , long imprisoned in the tired streets of Whitneyville , would now run free  --  or , running beyond his strength , would die . He crossed himself and stepped to the edge of the platform . For a moment his fears and wishes canceled out , and he felt that he knew himself for the first time . " This is me ! " he said aloud . Holding his body straight , he fell carefully and precisely forward . " Here he comes ! " someone yelled . Falling , he saw the small round tank , the ladder rushing by , the stars black out ( Do n't turn , do n't bend ? " Mother ! " ) , the tank hurtling toward him  --  then he smashed into it . ED-SPANGLED blackness battered his breathless body , his bruised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could think , he knew he was crushed against the canvas bottom of the tank . He hardly dared to move . But he pushed his heavy , aching body up into the great blaze of naked bulbs . A roar came and he saw the open mouths of the shouting crowd , distorted by the drops of water over his pupils . He waded to the rim of the tank , pulled himself up , and dropped over to the ground . His legs shuddered . But his anger came back . " Bastards ! " he muttered . A new howl from the people enveloped him . His knees seemed without tendons , his thighs and calves without flesh , as though the denuded bones were walking . Chief and Satchel-butts , grinning , pushed forward and clapped him on the back . Then Stan heard his own voice , hoarse and exultant , " I could do it again ! Jesus , I could do it again !
