Redeployment . Willys-Overland took the wraps off its civilian jeep last week . It looked just like the G.I. 's car-of - all- work . <P> But as a farmer 's car-of - all- trades , the new jeep can pull a plow , harrow or load of hay ; by means of a power take-off at the rear it can run a saw , threshing machine , or drill post holes . Slicked up , with top , side curtains , and comfortable seats , it can carry farmer &; family to town . Willys expects to make 20,000 civilian jeeps this year , expects to sell them in the neighborhood of $900 . <P> Competition . Pan American Airway 's monopoly in the Pacific ran into stormy weather last week . In a report , Civil Aeronautics Board examiners recommended that United Air Lines , second biggest U.S. domestic line , be given a route from the co-terminals of San Francisco and Los Angeles to Hawaii . When &; if CAB finally grants the route , United will fly two round trips a day with 50-passenger DC-6s . <P> Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get new tires next February or March . So John L. Collyer predicted last week , as he resigned as WPB 's rubber boss to resume the presidency of B. F. Goodrich Co . Like all rubber promises , this one was elastic : the U.S. will be dangerously short of natural rubber by year 's end , will have only 66,000 tons on hand . Before A-card civilians get their tires , the U.S. will have to find 75,000 more tons of natural rubber than are now in sight . <P> Old Mother Hubbard . OPA magnanimously dropped rationing of about 6,000 new 1942 cars still in the nation 's stock pile , scarcely enough to meet one day 's prewar demand . Many dealers , to avoid argument , simply went right on selling cars only to holders of top priorities . OPA also announced that , when the new cars roll off production lines , they will be rationed at first to the same eight classes of essential drivers who previously got stockpile cars .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
