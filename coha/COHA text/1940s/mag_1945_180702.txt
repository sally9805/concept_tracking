In the early dawn a detachment of Cuban soldiers surrounded a farmhouse near the sponge-fishing port of Bataban . Under a heap of palm leaves , in slacks and sport shirt , they found quaking ex-Colonel Jos Pedraza , their former Chief of Staff , until recently in exile . They took him and five civilians caught with him to the military prison in ancient Cabanas Fortress across the harbor from Havana . So ended last week a revolution that never took place . <P> Meanwhile other soldiers combed Havana . They dragged from bed at 6 a.m. a fine collection of former Army officers ( including two ex-aides of ex-President Fulgencio Batista ) , one private , a few civilians . All the officers except one air force lieutenant had been dismissed from the service by President Grau . <P> For twenty days , announced the Government smugly , it had known about the conspiracy . Army leaders , pretending to join , had kept the authorities informed . When Colonel Pedraza slipped into Cuba a few days ago , he was trailed by police . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not even let the nipped plot throw it into a tailspin . There were no disorders , no swarming of cops and sol diers . Instead , that night a festive crowd marched through the streets of downtown Havana , chanted and cheered outside the President 's Palace . They did demand the death of Pedraza . <P> Speaking from the Palace balcony , popular President Grau declared that the culprits would be tried , the guilty punished . He urged the people to be " sensible and correct , " to " help the Government safe guard the nation 's democratic institutions . " The President did not mention a name in every Cuban 's mind : ex-President Batista , the Strong Man who dominated Cuba for a decade until he permitted Grau to win a fair election in 1944 . Several plotters were close friends of Batista , now touring the U.S. in something very like exile . Many were his associates . Pedraza himself was dismissed from office by Batista for plotting against him in 1941 . But Cubans wondered whether the two men may have met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grau next day at a press conference : The plot was hatched by " capitalists who had business deals with the Batista regime . " Large sums were spent on a press campaign to stir up trouble . Plans included his own assassination and that of his Chief of Staff . " I have no sure proof , " said Grau , " of Batista 's participation , but neither have I proof that he is not involved . " <P> In San Francisco , Batista hit the ceiling . " Absurd ! " he cried . " But you really could use the word stupid . "
