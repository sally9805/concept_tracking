Fattest human being ever known to medical science was the late Mrs. Ruth G. Pontico of Tampa , Fla. , who was 5 ft. 5 in. tall and weighed 772 lb . This conclusion , the result of a long series of study of the proper anatomical dimensions of mankind , was made by David P. Willoughby , of the vertebrate paleontology department at the California Institute of Technology . Discoverer Willoughby reported his findings in a Johns Hopkins ' periodical , Human Biology . <P> Since every crossroads carnival has its fat lady , Willoughby was amazed to find fewer than 20 people in all medical historical records who exceeded 700 Ib. * <P> Mrs. Pontico , who died ( aged 38 ) of heart failure after an operation last fall , was a carnival fat lady . So was her mother , who was 6 ft. tall and weighed 720 lb . ( Her father , also a six-footer , weighed only 250 lb . ) Like most very fat people , Mrs. Pontico had always been that way . She weighed 16 lb. at birth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she managed to waddle about her large Tampa estate every few days , to climb stairs once or twice daily . " The surprising thing , " says Willoughby , " is that anyone her size should be able to get about at all , since every movement , considering the weight of the body and limbs , became veritably a feat of strength . " He concludes that her muscles must have been much stronger than the average woman 's . <P> Surprisingly enough , Mrs. Pontico ate only about 50% more food than an ordinary person-which , in proportion to her size , was only about one-third as much as an average person eats . Obesity on the Pontico scale , says Willoughby , is no longer believed to be due directly to faulty glands , but rather to " those parts of the metabolic apparatus itself which have to do with the stimulation of appetite and the absorption of fat-forming food elements . " <P> <P> *Heaviest ( but not fattest ) person on record was Miles Darden . When he died in 1857 in Henderson County @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But Darden was 7 ft. tall . If he had been of the same proportions as rotund Mrs. Pontico , he would have weighed an even ton .
