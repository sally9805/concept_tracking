Readers of Hearst 's American Weekly ( circ. 8,135,982 ) whose Sunday breakfast is a pumped-up omelet of cornfield murders , betrayed maidens , prehistoric monsters and the evils of vivisection , are going to get more herbs with their eggs . A new publisher is in the kitchen . He is 63-year-old Walter Howey , onetime holy terror of Chicago journalism , and the real-life model of Front Page 's brash , blustery managing editor . <P> Howey , who rang the bell with his Iroquois Theater fire scoop ( 1903 ) and turned Chicago newspaperdom on its ear by his banner-lined blasting of thieving politicos , has quieted down since the old raw-meat days . In recent years he has been running Hearst 's dreary Boston tabloids , the Record and American , in quiet , nice-old-boy fashion . So while some of his greying onetime minions like Burton Rascoe and Charlie MacArthur may have felt a twinge of nostalgia , they could not have been surprised to hear that mellowing Walter Howey 's first move on the Sunday-supplement American Weekly was a peace move : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hearst 's local feature editors . <P> A Few Names . Previously the American Weekly got its regional U.S. coverage through the back door , from Hearst rewrite men around the country . They did Weekly stories for sideline cash without telling their local publishers - who might have chosen to run the story in their own news columns . Under the new system , Weekly stories will be ordered direct through the local Hearst publisher . If the plan works ( i.e. , if other Hearst brass hats will play along ) , Howey will have the whole Hearst empire at his beck &; call . <P> Aiding &; abetting them will be a crew of good rewrite men , several recently hired from the New York Daily News . <P> Instead of smalltime bylines , American Weekly will henceforth parade such high-priced talent as Fannie Hurst , John Erskine , Paul Gallico , Damon Runyon , et al , from Hearst 's Cosmopolitan circuit . <P> " Of course , they will have to be housebroken to American Weekly ways , " says slim , smart Martin J. ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third editor in the Weekly 's 49 lurid years - and who is also , in print and flamboyant illustration , quite a few light years ahead of the scientists . <P> The Tried &; True . Starting in the fall , American Weekly covers will feature not just pretty-girl heads &; shoulders , but Nell Brinkley-type dimpled beauties with legs out of Esquire . Inside , the magazine will continue to ask the tried &; true question like : " If the Earth Becomes Uninhabitable-Where Shall We Go ? " Only now the answers will look more authoritative . <P> The treacle for snaring readers discovered by Morrill Goddard , when Hearst lured him away from Pulitzer to found the Weekly , still works . A typical Goddard issue mixed a princess in distress , an actress " telling all , " science 's latest mechanical brain , and a snorting brontosaurus . Oldtime Goddard-admirers at the American Weekly say that his secret was his ability to believe anything that made a good story . It was a big help that most of the things he wanted to believe happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
