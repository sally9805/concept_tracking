REQUIEM A Story SALLY KELLEY Mpg F LORENE and Ma sat on the front porch , resting . Ma more than filled a big rocker ; she bulged over . Her huge legs , without stockings , were distorted with varicose veins ; wisps of gray hair straggled about her full , bland face . Now and then , automatically , she moved her right hand and felt tenderly of the hard lump in her right side . Without interest , she watched Florene , seated on a cane-bottomed chair with a small mirror in her lap , as she plucked her eyebrows to thin lines , palely blond like her frizzled hair . Occasionally a car or a truck passed in front of the house , on the black-topped highway , and Ma and Florene would look up quickly , and their eyes would not drop again until the car passed out of sight around the curve . Only a few yards in front of the house , on the other side of the highway , flowed the St. Francis River , all cool and glittering in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much passin ' today , " she murmured , just for words to say . " Wo n't be till cotton pickin ' starts , " said Florene with sharpness . " Seem like you 'd know that , Ma . " " I reckon so , " said Ma helplessly . " Crops all laid by , got to set here and watch them what 's got cars ride by . Looks like Big Son would come oncet in awhile and take his maw for a little spin . " " Gas is scarce , Ma , " said Florene with hitter patience . " Do n't you know they 's a war on ? " Ma sighed again , and Florene felt guilty . Why did she snap Ma up like this all the time ? It was n't anything Ma did , but Florene just felt like snapping at everybody . Dull , hot day , bare and ugly house . . . sometimes she just wished she could shake out of her skin and be somebody else for a little while ! Another car came down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beaming . " Speak of the devil , " she said happily . " Here 's Big Son now ! " The car stopped right in front , almost in the tiny yard , where the growing cotton came around to the small bare space ; Big Son waved his hand in a snappy hail , waited for his wife to hand him the baby . Ma began to shout , " Hello , Butch ! Hello , Butchie Boy ! " Butchie Boy , in reply , gave a shriek like that of a locomotive coming round the bend . His mother often said she 'd be glad when he learned to talk , because all he could do now was squeal and holler " Daddy . " Big Son 's wife , Luberda , came up the short , hard-baked path , where the draggled zinnias lay sprawled upon either side . Florene , without excitement , had gone into the house and was now dragging out two more cane-bottomed chairs . She and Luberda gave each other a quick , appraising glance , from feet to hair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him into Ma 's lap , where she regarded him tenderly , speaking unintelligible love words . Butch was fourteen months old , and so fat his suit seemed about to burst off at any moment . His legs were like two lengths of stuffed sausage , and his heavy jaws sagged as he looked around the gathering solemnly . " Ai nt he fine ? " said Ma proudly . " We ' us jest wishin ' you 'd come , Son , " she added . " Jest talkin ' about you , was n't we Florene ? " Florene did not answer . She had brought out a bottle of nail polish , the color of blood , and was carefully doing her nails , as Luberda looked on with boredom . Luberda 's own nails were long and curved and painted a violent magenta . " Where 's Pa and Elrod ? " asked Big Son , yawning , and using a match for a toothpick . " They hitched up the team and went over to take a shoat to Suggs 's . Pa sold him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no time for traipsin ' . Elrod went along because of Suggs 's gal , Esilee . You know , Elrod 's been gal-in ' . " " I was n't gal-in ' when I was sixteen , " said Big Son reproachfully . " Better watch out he do n't git marrit on you . " " Me an ' Pa 's been talkin ' about that . Elrod 's too young to handle a wife . Pa told him he better join the Navy , an ' we 'll sign the papers . Make a man of him , they say . " Ma rubbed her side and groaned a little as she shifted in her chair . Luberda looked at her curiously , without sympathy . " Why n't you go to the clintic and have that thing cut out , anyway ? I knowed a woman oncet , died because she was afraid to be cut on . Guess now she wishes she had ! " Florene spoke sharply . " No need skeerin ' her , Lu . Anyway , it ai n't nothin ' to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life jest settled there in Ma , that 's all . " Butch was emitting regular squeals . " Shut up , Butch , " said Luberda . " How you and Woody makin ' it ? " she asked Florene . Florene shrugged and did not answer . " Seem like her love for Woody is dead , " remarked Ma sentimentally . " I 'd like to know how anybody else knows when my love is dead ! " snapped Florene . " Woody 's got a good job now , " said Luberda . " Drivin ' the city dump truck outer Wynridge , haulin ' stuff out to the river  --  better'n share-croppin ' . I said shut up , Butch ! " " Oh , I do n't know , " said Florene , her voice high and affected . She held up one hand , examined the nails admiringly . " I stood him up the other night , we was goin ' to the box supper over to Gold Dust schoolhouse . . . . I do n't aim for him to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fish fry next Sunday . May let him take rne , do n't know . There 's plenty others . " " I 've got a new pair slacks to wear to the fish fry , " said Luberda , patting a yawn delicately . Florene did not look up . " I bought me a couple pair too , got ' em from Sears ' Summer Sale catalogue , sure got me a couple dillies . One green , one sorta rose color . Gon na wear ' em with some new rayon blouses . " " Society , society , " said Ma . " Society and new clothes ! All is vanity . " " All right , Ma , " said Florene . " Pour cold water . " " Bet she bought ' em for Woody , " teased Big Son . " Woody 's a good boy , " said Ma . " I reckon folks is a-talkin ' . . . the way they been a-runnin ' together all these months , if they ai n't marrit , they oughter be . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Plenty of time . I marrit when I was seventeen , an ' now look where I am ! " Big Son blinked , but did not speak for a few minutes . " You an ' Pa sure done a good day 's work , Ma , when you got to sharecrop on this place . Right out on the road where you can always see passin ' . Maybe next year I can crop here too . " " Yes , " said Luberda , " you cert'ny got a swell view . Where we 're at , the gumbo gits so deep when it rains , you cai n't pull out without a tractor . I sure hope we can git clost to the highway next year ! " as the world , you-all , somebody 's done fell in the river ! Less go see . Shut up , Butch ! " Luberda and Florene grabbed up Butch and ran to the car and sat and waited impatiently while Big Son helped Ma down the plank steps . She walked very slowly , wobbling . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue chambray dress she was wearing . After much straining and grunting , she got into the front seat and held Butch in her lap . He was squealing in ecstasy . With a great amount of popping and smoke from the exhaust , they started off . They went down the highway along the river , and suddenly Luberda said excitedly , " I do believe it 's at the dump pile ! Lookit the folks runnin ' ! " Big Son turned off onto the graveled road which led to the dump pile , where they saw all the people gathering . They clambered out and Luberda and Florene , leaving Big Son to take care of Butch and Ma , began to run like children , with heads down and feet lifted high in the air . When they reached the bank they saw the canoe already in the water , and one man paddled , while another stood up and raked through the water with a long pole which had a huge hook at one end . A little distance away stood the truck which was used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right on the edge of the bank , and halfway down there was a shovel , as though it had been flung or dropped there . At the sight of all this , Florene sank to the ground and began to scream . " It 's Woody , it 's Woody ! " she cried , and the tears streaked her make-up . She rocked in grief and all the people looked and some of them cried in sympathy and came over and put their arms about her . At this Florene only cried the louder . There was an unpleasant smell all about , which was burning trash and decaying vegetables ; for the townspeople often cameby and dropped a load of their waste , and they did n't bother with seeing that it went into the water , so there was always a fire smoldering . Old grapefruit and orange peels , broken glass , and old tin cans covered the banks at this point . A fine dust lay everywhere . In the greenish , stagnant water , the man probed and dragged his hook . Now and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orange crate or a long strip of tarpaulin or a bundle of twisted wire or a rotten shoe . Then the other man would paddle in a larger circle , and the man with the hook would try again . " What happened ? " they asked , but nobody knew anything except old Joe Belch , who was feeling very prominent , going about talking to everybody . He did n't know much , only that he 'd been walking that way and had heard a shout and seen the flailing arms , but he did n't know who it was , because the man never came up again . Joe had run all the way to the crossroads store and put in a call for the fire department at Wynridge , who always sent somebody when there was a drowning . The people listened , and looked at Florene weeping , and they said , " Woody was a good boy . . . " ; they said , " Woody told me just last week . . . " ; " I seen him just the other day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they mouthed his name and it seemed to satisfy something within them , as they talked and talked , remembering Woody . Woody with the bright blue eyes and the red hair and one leg just a bit shorter than the other , only the way he walked , high , wide and handsome , it was not a defect at all . Woody , who had been going with Florene all these months . Poor Florene ! Ma came over on her poor ugly legs and put her puffy hand on Florene 's shoulder , but Florene twitched her neck and so Ma moved it hastily . A little girl was digging about in the trash and the odds and ends half buried in the powdery dirt , and she brought up a doll which had no arms or legs . Triumphantly , she carried it to her mother , lifting it high with a thin hand and a bony arm in a faded sleeve . Big Son walked about , talking to the people he knew . He carried Butchie Boy high on his shoulders , his fat legs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father 's head with his fists and squealed continuously . " It 'll likely be weeks before they find him , " said a woman mournfully , then cried out to her little boy in blue overalls , " You come back here , Linzie ! You 'll fall in and the man 'll have to fish for you , too ! " Florene was leaning against a small tree , sobbing weakly . She looked about her at the crowd , which was becoming ever larger . She felt more important than she ever had in her whole life . They were all looking at her and she knew they were whispering , " See , that 's Florene Lumpkin ; that 's Voody 's girl friend . Poor Florene ! " Different ones came over and talked to her . There was everywhere an undercurrent of tremendous excitement . " Wonder does Woody 's aunt and uncle know ? He stays in town with them , you know , he 's a orphan boy . " " Somebody ought to go tell them . " " Somebody will , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the murmurs of the crowd , above Butch 's screaming , Florene heard another sound : the thin whanh-whanh of a harmonica . She looked about ; a stran- ger stood on the fringe of the crowd and when she looked at him his eyes met hers , and he put the harmonica to his mouth again and began to play softly , and in her mind Florene let herself sing the tune : Puh-Sant some flow'rs upon my gr-r-rave , dear , Just a lit-tul bunch of themmmmm ? Makes no diffunce what they are , dear , Just so 's yo ' han 's has planted themmmtn . Woody 's favorite song . . . 0 Woody ! She began to cry more loudly . No more to hear him sing , no more going to town on Saturday nights to the movies , nothing with Woody again , never no more ! The strange man kept playing sadly , and now and then Florene looked at him , tears filling her eyes . He had a little black mustache , and he wore a white shirt open at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cotton trou- sers . He wore no hat ; his black hair shone in the sun . " Who 's that playin ' ? " Florene said to Luberda , as though it did n't matter at all . " Oh , that 's the feller , I do n't know his name , but he 's gon na stay and help old MAGAZINE man Giddens gather his crop . Some relation , I think . Nice lookin ' , ai n't he ? " Florene did n't answer . Every now and then she got out her compact and wipedher face with a draggled-looking puff ; but then pretty soon she was crying again , so it did n't do any good . The crowd was watching intently as the man dragged in the water . Now he had hold of something with the hook ; they all watched , hardly breathing as he tugged and tugged and now up came a broken old baby carriage . . . " Ah-h-h-h ! " said the crowd , letting go its breath . Down the river a little way , past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was green and blue with sun-light making diamonds everywhere and the trees on the bank reflected in its depths . Only here , in this little curve , there was death and foulness , where the people of Wynridge sent their garbage . . . ID ui:mm.41N there was a shout . The crowd all turned ; they began to talk loudly . There , along the graveled road , came Woody ! No ghost , but Woody , strutting as he always did , laughing , throwing back his red head . They surrounded him , shaking his hand , all talking together . He looked pleased at the excitement . He came over to Florene . She shook her head slowly . " Woody ! We thought you was dead ! " " I ai n't drivin ' the dump truck no more , " he explained for the tenth time . " I 'm gon na night-watch down to Pay-son 's gin from now on  --  make fi ' dollars more a week , tuu . They 's a ole nigger got my dumpin ' job this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He said he could drive the truck and shevel the trash , but I reckon he could n't handle it . " Woody looked compassionately at the scene on the river . All through the crowd went the words , " Just a ole nigger man , " and they turned away . They walked slowly to cars and trucks or to the highway , where they stood to catch a ride back . Ma did n't want to go at all . " They 'll find him in a minute , maybe , Big Son , " she pleaded . " I want to see . " " Oh , Ma , " said Florene impatiently , combing out her fluffy hair and hoping her face was n't swelled , " it may be weeks before they find him . He 's liable to be caught down there under those old tin cans and stuff . " " I got to go now , Ma , " said Big Son . " It 's gittin ' sundown . . . . Shut up , Butch ! Come on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Looks like at my age , you 'd try to give me a little pleasure now and then , " groaned Ma , walking along beside him with her stumping gait ; " seems like I always miss everything . " " Ai n't you gon na ride , Flo ? " asked Luberda curiously . " She 's gon na walk with me , " said Woody firmly . " We got things to talk about . If me and Flo ca n't walk a measly little mile and a half , I reckon we better quit , had n't we , babe ? " The others went on . Florene and Woody left the men at the river , with one or two down on the bank , and they started walking . Florene felt a sense of utter desolation all through her . The brief drama was played out . The people had looked at her during the short afternoon , had put their hands on her shoulders as she wept , had said , " Poor Flo . " Now , though , they had left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murmured as they left , " A ole nigger man . " She and Woody were already forgotten . . . . Woody would not forget soon , however . He would talk and talk about how they had all thought he was dead and how they were sad because of it , when here he came walking up , and you should have seen their faces when they saw him large as life and twicet as natural ! Oh yes , she knew how Woody would go on and on about it . And tomorrow was another dull day and if it did n't rain she had to wash ; black iron pot and rub-board and ironing with the heavy black irons  --  and if it did rain so she did n't have to wash , why there was nothing to do but sit around the house with Ma and Pa and Elrod and fuss , or look at the Sears catalogue or maybe read the True Love stories she 'd already read three-four times ! Over and over , same old thing ! As they walked slowly away , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the stranger she had seen ages ago , it seemed , was following at a distance , playing snatches of melody upon his harmonica . She stopped and called out , " What 's matter , back there ? You afraid we 'll bite or somethin ' ? " Woody was annoyed . He pulled at her arm , but she stood still until the strange man came up , walking like he had alI day , and took his place on her other side . " What 's your name ? " she asked softly , fluttering her eyelashes a little . He waited a moment before answering , and his eyes met hers in a long glance , filled with secret understanding . His mouth smiled a little , under the short mustache . " Mah name 's Pomeroy , " he said . " Well , then , Pomeroy , " she said teasingly , " play us a tune . " He ran his mouth over the harmonica a couple of times , and then with a twinkle in his eye , a sly look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowers upon my grave , dear , " sang out the harmonica on the evening air .
