txt The long and none too happy reign of the five-cent fare on New York City subways is drawing to a not-yet-very-well publicized close . New Yorkers , commuters and casual visitors who drop about two billion nickels in the turnstiles every year are going to have to pay a little more , per ride , before another 12 months pass . They are , that is , unless all the present portents prove wrong . Today you can ride six blocks or 30 miles for five cents . It does n't make sense . It never did make much sense except for a brief period after 1913 when the former Brooklyn-Manhattan Transit Corp . and Interborough Rapid Transit Co. contracted to equip and operate municipally constructed subway lines at that fare . After that it was the now familiar story of little or no return for the city from its huge investment and recurring financial difficulties for the two companies . City Got a Little from I. R. T. The city never did get anything on its investment in B.-M . T. : from the I. R. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make matters worse , the city in the 1920 's was foiced tr build a new and even more expensive line . Nobody wanted to operate that one  --  not on a five-cent fare . The city operated the new line at five cents itself , even though it was costing more than 10 cents to carry each passenger . The obvious solution was to raise the fare , but politicians dreaded to take that step for fear of reprisals at the polls . Last year 's unification of the former B.-M . T. and I.R.T. lines under full municipal control dealt the five-cent fare a body blow as a political campaign slogan ; increased operating costs on the unified lines will deliver the final knock-out What unification did was to create a situation whereby all benefit arising from an increased fare would accrue directly to the city , rather than in part to the city and in part to the companies . That 's a strong talking point La Guardia May Break " News " in 1942 All that remains now is for Mayor La Guardia  --  possibly some time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In recent years it has been necessary to subsidize the subways to the tune of around $30 million annually . This year 's subway deficit will be heavier , and next year 's even more so . unless something is done about the fare . Within recent months , operating costs of the unified lines have been increased by roughly $6 million annually , as a result of adjust. ments on rates of pay for similar work on the three main divisions of the system , the Independent Subway. the former B.-M T and the former I.R.T lines . That does n't satisfy the employes . They want a raise , and they 'll get one whatever the courts may decide on demands of the Transport Workers Union for recognition of the closed shop . Such an increase would be only in line with the trend toward higher pay for all municipal workers throughout the country . An increase of only 10% in pay ? it might be more ? for New York City subway work cr would add another $6 million annually to the cost of running the unified lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " excess of revenues over operating expenses " for the combined lines came to only-327.769.213 in the fiscal year ended June 30 , last , the indicated impact of recent wage " adjustments " and the estimated cost of a general wage increase , is tremendous . Certainly , these figures alone are sufficient to indicate that so long as the five-cent fare continues little will be left for the city M the way of a return on the $1.5 billion invested in tin lines . The figures do n't tell the whole story The story also includes increases in cost of all sorts of materials necessary for operation of the system . The situation has its brighter side . New York can raise the fare by an amount sufficient to eliminate the present annual subway deficit and still give its citizens a value in transportation that probably is unmatched it any part of the world . By collecting only two cents more from each of the roughly two billion passengers who annually use the lines , municipal revenues from transit would be boosted by around $40 roill ; on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real estate owners who in reality have been carrying the subway burden right along  --  may ask that the fare be boosted all the way to 10 cents . Their request may be granted , but seven cents might prove a better guess . It is likewise probable that suggestions for " zoning " the tines so as to charge one fare for a short ride , a higher one for a. longer ride . will be turned down . If anything is done along this line it will more likely let down the barriers further through establishment of universal free transfer privileges between the three main divisions of the system .
