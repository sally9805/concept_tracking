Gandhi Story <P> Sir : <P> The world owes you a debt of gratitude for the wonderful paragraphs on Mahatma Gandhi in TIME , Feb. 9 . I have rarely seen such inspired journalism . <P> FRED FIELD GOODSELL <P> Boston , Mass . <P> Point in History <P> Sir : <P> Churchill is right TIME , Feb. 2 . The world is at a crucial point in the evolutionary process . We have here and now to resolve the question as to whether the world social organism shall advance toward closer integration along the lines of individual freedom and intelligent self-determination , which is democracy , or within a matrix of " scientific " and coercive direction by a political elite , which is world Communism . <P> What democracy needs is faith in herself-faith to combat fanaticism , and a dialectic realism to combat dialectic materialism . Historical and evolutionary trends , in the long view , are on the side of freedom and the brotherhood of man , as against regimentation and the comradery of the Politburo . <P> A. R.

FAN . <P> GRETCHEN MERRILL <P> St. Moritz , Switzerland <P> Sir : <P> Thank you for the fine article on Canada 's sweetheart . . . . Let us hope that the 12,500,000 prayers you mention tack on as a postscript the request that she never go to Hollywood . More power to Barbara Ann , and kudos to TIME for a most interesting story . <P> VERNON CRAWFORD <P> Charlottesville , Va . <P> Sir : <P> The second , fourth and fifth of the Olympic School Figures appearing with your article are drawn in accordance with standard practice , from the skater 's viewpoint . Not so with the other two , the rocker and the three-change-three . They are drawn from an observing fish 's viewpoint . <P> VERNON E. GARDNER <P> Washington , D.C. <P> TIME 'S Diagramer and his researcher knew they were skating on thin ice but hoped no fish were looking . ( The Rs on the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) - ED . <P> Hopes &; Prayers <P> Sir : <P> It is disappointing that the Status of Women Commission of the United Nations should receive such unsympathetic and undignified treatment from a magazine of the caliber of TIME Jan. 26 . <P> After centuries of control by men , the world is still seared by ever more frequent and violent wars and threats of war . Fear , oppression , poverty , disease and crime still stalk abroad . <P> Women have now been given the opportunity by the United Nations to take part in public affairs . They hope and pray that by the united effort of men &; women working together , these specters will be banished from the world . <P> Throughout history women have encouraged and helped men in their endeavors . Is it too much to expect men to do likewise ? . . . <P> ( MRS . ) JESSIE M. G.
