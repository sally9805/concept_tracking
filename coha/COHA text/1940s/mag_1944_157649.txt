A BELL FOR ADANO-John Hersey- Knopf ( $2.50 ) . <P> This is a first novel . Angry and intense , it is half sharp-eyed , unsparing war reporting and half fast-moving , self-consciously hard-boiled fiction . It is the story of what happens behind the lines of a typical Italian town in the confused interlude between war and reconstruction- when the Germans have been driven out and the Allies have come in , when the fascists are out of office but the civilian governments have not yet been set up , and when the high aims for which the war was fought disappear before the realities of incompetence , brutality , red tape , swollen eyes , dead bodies , ruined buildings , ruined lives , cynicism , contempt , and the starved inertia of purposeless living . <P> It begins when Major Victor Joppolo , 35 , a senior officer of the Allied Military Government of Occupied Territory , enters the town of Adano . It ends , 266 pages and three weeks later , when he is recalled . Between these two episodes it packs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the errors and accomplishments of the administration of the occupied village ; 2 ) an unforgettable , sometimes sickening picture of the degradation of the Italians after 20 years of Mussolini ; 3 ) a lopsided , bitter portrait of a loudmouthed , fire-eating , bullying U.S. general , who resembles General Patton ; 4 ) a plot . The work of 29-year-old LIFE Editor John Hersey ( Men on Bataan , Into the Valley ) , based on his war-reporting experiences in Sicily , it has an impact like the kick of one of the mules on the road to Adano . <P> Wop v. General . Hero of the book is Major Joppolo . He is patient , tenacious , understanding , humble in the sense of being willing to drudge for what he believes in , and possessed of a genuine love for Adano , the place and the people . This love is epitomized in his effort to get the people of Adano a church bell to replace the bell the Nazis carried off for scrap . Sometimes it seems that Major Joppolo is the only person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one who has a practically realizable vision of what democracy can bring to Adano . Raised in The Bronx , razzed as a wop in school , a truck driver at 16 , a $12-a-week grocery clerk at 20 , a second-class clerk in New York City 's Department of Sanitation before going into the Army , Victor Joppolo brings to Adano the unbelievable thought that government should be the servant of the people . There are no subtle shadings in Author Hersey 's portraits . Victor is unqualifiedly good . <P> U.S. Divisional Commander General Marvin is unqualifiedly bad . He has been built up as one of the heroes of the invasion . But " I can tell you perfectly calmly that General Marvin showed himself during the invasion to be a bad man , something worse than what our troops were trying to throw out . "
