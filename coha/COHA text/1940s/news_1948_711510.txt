txt ACTION BY MAYOR DELAYS BUS TIE-UP His Last-Minute Intervention Extends Talks by the TWO With Third Ave . Officers By ALEXANDER , FEINBERG Mayor O'Dwyer 's last minute intervention brought a postponement of a ' strike vote last night that would have tied up all bus lines of the Third Avenue Transit Corporation serving more than 2,000,000 riders daily in Manhattan , the Bronx and Westchester . With the bus membership waiting to ratify strike action at Transport Hall , 153 West Sixty-fourth , Street , the Mayor cut through a seemingly hopeless impasse to obtain from Michael J. Quill , international president oft the Transport Workers Union , a promise to recommend the withholding of a walkout pending union-company negotiations next week . Hurrying to the strike meeting from City Hall , Mr. Quill and other members of the negotiating committee of Local 100 informed the men . that the Mayor had obtained from the company a tacit understanding that it would hold off on putting into effect new schedules , and also its order issued during the day for the dropping of fiftytwo shop maintenance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting had been called for 8 P. M. , but was delayed while union and company officials went into session at City Hall in response to a summons from the Mayor . After a brief joint session , starting at 6 P. M. , in the Board of Estimate chamber , the company and union delegations met separately to consider a proposal by the Mayor that an arbitrator be designated to rule on the two principal points at issue . This proposal did not prove acceptable , but at 8:15 after both groups had reported to him , the // Mayor announced that . the union and the company would go into a joint negotiating session next week in an effort to compose their differences . If a settlement is not reached both parties are to notify him by 4 P. M. next Friday . In announcing the gaining of at least a week 's delay in the strike the Mayor said : " In this dispute there were two points of difference between the parties , one old and one new . The old point dealt with an agreement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreement it was understood that management and labor would sit down and agree on how many men should be laid off and who the men should be . " Management has notified fiftytwo men that they are to be laid off . The union contends that this should not take place because there has been no agreement on , it . The management 's answer is that although it has met with the union many times they have been unable to agree . ' The new point at issue has to do with the schedules which were to be put into effect next Monday ( the company had announced the new schedules for Sunday , the same day set tentatively by the union for the strike to become effective ) . After hearing both sides the Mayor recommended arbitration ' of these points . Union Agrees to Talks " After a caucus the union representatives informed the Mayor that they were reluctant to turn down the suggestion of arbitration but were not prepared tit , accept it at this time . They stated , however , that if the layoff order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect they would sit down with the company every day next week if necessary and try to adjust the differences . " The Mayor then requested Mr. ( John M. , president of the Third Avenue lines ) and the other officers of the company to restore the January schedules and cancel the order for the layoff of the fifty-two men . " Mr. would not say flatly that the company had agreed to this , remarking merely that " the Mayor has spoken for all of us . " It was understood , however , that the company was going along with the Mayor 's suggestions pending the outcome of next week 's negotiations . Theodore W. ICheel , director of the city 's division of labor relations , who got the contending parties to go to City Hall , said it was the understanding that failure td reach an agreement by next Friday would be reported to the Mayor at that time . Fare Plea Seen as Factor Originally deadlocked over the projected winter schedule the company and the - union appeared to be even more hopelessly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the layoffs were beginning . ? " This is proof that they want the strike , ' Mr. Quill remarked when told of the lay-offs . He suggested that the company might not be too anxious to effect a settlement , hoping by this means to force the hand of the Public Service Commission in granting it a fare increase . Mr. Quill insists that the proposed winter schedules would overburden the bus drivers . He said that a retention of the Jan. , 1948 , schedules would be " much better for the workers and the public . " An opposite view was expressed by James Hodes , executive vice president of the Third Avenue Lines . " That 's management 's prerogative , " he declared . " If we ca n't do that ( put the new schedules into effect ) we ca n't run our company . We have the right to schedule our buses as management thinks best . " Mr. Hotles said that the new schedules called for a " leveling out of our transportation so that as far as the public is concerned it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It only means that we will have more stand-bys , as far as the drivers are concerned . " He explained that the Schedules called for " spacing the buses in the deep valley ' periods when there is little traffic in midday on some lines so that we can adequately ' take care of riders , but we do n't have excess buses riding , empty . " He denied this would cause overloading and rejected Mr. Quill 's suggestion that it had anything to do ? with the reopening of the schools . As ' for the lay-offs , Mr. Hodes said that they had been postponed for six weeks . With motorization I , of the lines completed last month , he asserted that " we have those men , but We have nothing for them to do . We are just trying to stop some of our losses . We ca n't keep going . on that Way . " . Mr. Quill took , with him to the City Hall conference John F. O'Donnell , who has been named counsel to Local 100 to succeed Harry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right and left-wing factions for union ' control . Also representing the union were Austin Hogan , Local 100 president , who is ranged with the left wing in opposition to Mr. Quill ; Gustav Faber , secretarytreasurer of Local 100 , who is standing with Mr. Quill , and a negotiating committee of twenty-two members . The company was represented by Mr. , Mr. Hodes and Mortimort S. Gordon , company counsel . No strike vote was taken at the meeting in TWU headquarters where , with only a handful of dissenters , a motion to delay a strike was carried . Three hundred bus employes who attended were addressed by Mr. Quill and other members of the negotiating committee . Mr. Hogan , as chairman , did not make a. formal speech but indicated that his attitude was " let 's wait and see what happens . " The TWU meeting began a little before 9 P. M. and was over by 10:15 P. M. In his speech Mr. Quill said that " this city should take over - the private roads and make you city employes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressed the opinion that " it is time that the TWU came out for the purchase of the roads and complete unification . " That should be done , he said , before the Second Avenue subway is built . He declared that he had not consulted with the Mayor , who previously had come out for city operation of all bus lines , but said that this- would be incorporated in TWU 's program for next year .
