Anthony Eden said that Britain had been " doing the splits over an ever-widening abyss . " Last week Britain slipped and was left clinging to the face of a clif f . <P> " Dollars to Save Britain . " The story of this calamity-one of the most important events of the postwar world-begins two years ago when Lord Keynes came to the U.S. to talk about getting dollars to save Britain . Keynes started with the idea that nothing less than 5 billion dollars would prime the pump ; even that would have to be protected by special restrictions against seepage . The American negotiators told him he was wrong ; they said 3.75 billion was enough , and that Britain , in . the interests of freer world trade , would have to throw away protective restrictions . The British , having no choice , agreed to the smaller sum , and promised that after July 15 , 1947 , they would permit those who got British pounds in " current transactions " to exchange them for dollars . <P> Americans who remember 1933 could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were busted and some were half-busted . Some half-busted banks reopened with the understanding that old accounts of depositors were still tied up , but deposits made after the reopening were fully usable . In the British situation , the 14 billion of sterling balances around the world ( tied up like the old deposits in half-busted U.S. banks ) are known as " accumulated sterling . " Since the British have not nearly enough dollars to exchange for this " accumulated sterling , " they had never promised to pay it off after the July 15 deadline . <P> Run on the Bank . When the British accepted the hard bargain driven by the U.S. , they tried to make a virtue of necessity and kidded themselves that lifting of restrictions on " current transactions " would work . It did not . Traders in other countries wanted dollars more and pounds less than the British Treasury thought they would . The British pound had so little production back of it compared to the U.S. dollar that when anybody owning pounds had a choice he converted them into dollars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or shoes or trucks or machinery he wanted . <P> These traders , assisted in some cases by the central banks of their countries , found ways to disguise the " accumulated sterling " as " current transactions " money . The result was a run on the British dollar supply . Before July 15 , the British Treasury had been losing dollars at the rate of 77 million a week . After July 15 , the rate suddenly jumped up to 115 million a week ; in the last six days , dollar withdrawals totaled $237 million . This situation was just as if new runs had started on the half-busted U.S. banks after they reopened in 1933 , and the banks had found no way of distinguishing between the new deposits and the old . <P> The Old School Belt . Tense with anxiety , the British Treasury 's gloomy office in Great George Street tried to stop the " run on the bank . " Chancellor of the Exchequer Hugh Dalton , whose toothy grin is almost inextractable , predicted that the run would slow down in August @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Cabinet meeting .
