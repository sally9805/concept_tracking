The first rule of most clubs , colleges and societies that apply " quotas " to restrict Jews is to deny that they would do any such thing . Dartmouth 's longtime President Ernest Martin Hopkins , having frankly admitted to using the quota system at Dartmouth , last week found himself roundly damned . <P> New York 's minority-conscious Post , belatedly learning of Hopkins ' views , skimped space from the war to bannerline on Page 1 : " DARTMOUTH BARS JEWS ' TO END ANTI-SEMITISM , ' SAYS PREXY . " Next day PM , the Post 's rival tabloid , took it up , running Hopkins ' picture side by side with Nazi Jew-baiter Alfred Rosenberg . PM accused President Hopkins of " spouting the Hitler-Rosenberg line , " or at best-talking " well-meaning but witless " nonsense . <P> " Sympathetic . " What started it all was a round-robin wire sent to 300 educators last January by the Independent Citizens Committee of the Arts , Sciences , and Professions , asking educators to speak out against restricting Jewish enrollment in schools . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UNDERSTAND COMPLEXITY OF PROBLEM AND AM SYMPATHETIC WITH PURPOSES YOU HAVE IN MIND . CAN NOT JOIN WITH YOU HOWEVER . . . . " <P> He amplified these views three months later in a letter to Broadway Producer Herman Shumlin ( The Male Animal , The Searching Wind ) , a director of the Independent Citizens Committee . Wrote Hopkins : " The fact can not safely be ignored that some things can not be done by violence but require persuasion . Those who do ignore it are killing the thing they love . . . . <P> " I would not for anything forgo the representation of Jewish boys that enroll year by year at Dartmouth , " he added . " Some of our outstanding alumni are Jews , as are some of the foremost benefactors of the college . . . . However . . . Dartmouth . . . would lose its racial tolerance , which it is desperately anxious not to lose , were we to accept unexamined the great blocks of Jewish applications which come in . . . . " <P> To this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you and shame . . . . It is fantastic to me that a man in your position can , at this date , make use of the very allegations which were used by Hitler and his accomplices . . . . " <P> Not Displeased . President of Dartmouth since 1916 , 67-year-old Dr. Hopkins has been outspoken in his opinions before . In 1930 he was one of the first U.S. college presidents to decry Prohibition , and was strongly interventionist before Pearl Harbor . <P> He was surprised at the hue &; cry over his latest statement which , he said , was never intended for publication ; but he was " not displeased that the problem is now in the open . " He still defended his course as the right one for Dartmouth : " Any college of restricted enrollment must depend on quotas in everything-as to East and West , public and private schools , urban and agricultural areas , and racial groups as well .
