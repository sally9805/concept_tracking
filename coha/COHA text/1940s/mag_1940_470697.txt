" T 's started , " a lean-faced , bedraggled , I unemployed steel worker announced excitedly . " I mean the war . Hitler 's marching into Poland . I just heard it on the radio , " he explained further to a group of sullen men loafing on South Mill Street , across from the relief headquarters in New Castle , Pennsylvania . The dead silence broke . One man whittling a stick dropped it . Another sitting on the curb got up and walked to the middle of the group . Someone asked hopefully , " Do you think the mills 'll start up ? " Everyone began to speculate aloud on this possibility . Within an hour news of the outbreak of war in Europe was alI over town . Rumors of good things to come began to fly fast and furiously . This is going to be a long war . . . . There 's going to be a big boom all over . . . . The mills , factories , and mines everywhere will soon be needin ' men . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jobs . . . . A few days later the Mayor of New Castle solemnly told us that U. S. Steel had received a large order from Japan and that the obsolete hand-mills would soon be reopened because the modern strip mills were being taxed to capacity . We heard about " the order from Japan " from a newsboy , a waitress , from conversations in the street , and from almost everyone we met . More hopes were being built on equally plausible rumors . Someone heard from some official at the mill that the war had caught the strip mills unprepared . . . . Canadian tinplate supplies were low . . . . The German submarineshad cut off Canadian can manufacturers from their regular supply of Welsh tinplate , at least for six months until England could organize its convoy transportation . . . . Old-timers in the tinplate trade were saying that the food packers would rush to buy up one hundred per cent of the 1939 vegetable and fruit crops , pack them into every tin can they could lay hands on , and store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packs until prices went up . Before the war was two weeks old everyone in town had convinced himself that U. S. Steel would have to reopen the hand-style tinplate mills , which had been abandoned for good , to meet these multitudinous demands for tinplate , despite the fact that hand-rolled tinplate costs were five to twenty dollars a ton higher than on the automatic strip mills . Dreams began to be dreamed ? not by workers alone , but by everyone in town . We 'll get the gas turned back on . . . We 'll pay the back rent and wo n't be kicked out . . . The kids can get new school clothes . . . . I 'll buy the wife a new dress . . . . Dad wo n't have to wear that sloppy old hat no more . . .. We 'll fix the car and buy a license for it . . . The milk bill can be paid and we 'll start to get milk again each morning . . . . Our rent collections will go up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The workers will start buying all the things they need and have been without . . . . New Castle will be back on its feet in no time . " Glory hallelujah ! " ? in brief , that is how World War II was greeted in New Castle . And understandably so , because private industry had deserted the town ; new machines had thrown 5,700 of its workers on the ash heap ; its industrial employment had declined sixty-four per cent since 1927 ; fifty-two per cent of its fifty thousand people were dependent upon government aid for subsistence ( with another twelve per cent trying to get relief or WPA jobs ) ; the State and Federal governments had turned a deaf ear to the workers ' call for real help , and the 76th Congress had limited their last Hope for employment by cutting WPA . With its future hopeless , despairing of any aid from private industry or government ( except meager relief or WPA grants ) , New Castle succumbed to the war fever . And not in vain . " ' M @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pittsburgh Press 's headline writer , twenty-six days after the war started , prefaced a front-page headline : " ' GHOST TOWNS ' IN DISTRICT STIR AS MILLS , MINES OPEN " The story under the headline announced that one of New Castle 's obsolete tinplate mills would resume operations , and 2,500 of its technologically displaced workers would be reemployed . Like the stranded people in other " ghost " steel and coal towns , the people of New Castle cheered ? though they must have guessed that the mill was being reopened for a limited and final time . " Ghost " towns in coal have been chronic since the end of World War I , but in steel they are something new . In the past two years the steel strip mills , " a moving picture director 's dream of the future of technology , " had displaced 25,000 hand-mill workers and turned more than a dozen thriving communities into " ghost " steel towns . Overnight the " war boom " put new life into several of these , like Ncw Castle and Martins Ferry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their obsolete mills idle , their displaced workers unemployed , symbolize the nation 's pressing economic problems that have cried out in vain for adomestic solution . The ghost towns that have been revived since the outbreak of war symbolize the way in which bombs over Warsaw can bring joy to workers , farmers , and industry starving respectively for work , higher prices , and profits . The deadly parallel between these ghost steel towns and the country as a whole , afflicted with common economic ills that have not responded to domestic forces , both resuscitated for the time being by war in Europe , raises the question : " After the war boom , what then ? " When the extraordinary tinplate and other steel demands cease , the skilled hand-mill workers will be through , this time for good . Revived steel towns will revert to ghost towns . More steel communities will be added to the " ghost " category . In all the horrors of a postwar depression the country 's pressing economic problems will be more acute , the plight of New Castle and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for domestic solutions inescapable . The war boom can only postpone the day when we shall have to come to grips with the economic ills it is temporarily solving . These ills are deep-rooted indeed . Distressed communities with stranded populations in the coal fields , depleted timber lands , copper , lead , zinc , oil , and gas districts , and textile centers have been the by-products of the exploitation of natural resources and the shifting of production centers . But in the steel industry ghost towns are the result of economic ills that permeate our national economy . Technological unemployment has reduced these steel towns to economic ruin . II The story of New Castle gives the picture of all the ghost steel towns , because their rise and fall resemble one another as closely as the play-by-play description of one football game resembles another . New Castle lies sixty miles north of Pittsburgh , midway between Lake Eric and the Ohio River , in the middle of the Shenango Valley . It was founded in 1798 by a small band of Swedish pioneers , who became prosperous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time of the Civil War ugly coal tipples began to dot the landscape of the beautiful valley , rich meadow lands were torn up to uncover limestone , and the iron ore openings spit forth huge chunks of red earth . " Billy " Patterson , a farm boy risen to banker , transformed the peaceful Shenango Valley into a seething industrial district , put its coal , ore , and limestone the main ingredients of iron and steel ? together , and sold his outside interests to concentrate on expanding New Castle . By 1890 he gave the town one of the country 's first integrated steel firms with a continuous chain from iron ore to finished products . Billy Patterson , having become an iron master and steel magnate , sported a walrus mustache in keeping with his reputation as " the father of New Castle . " The rise of New Castle was phenomenal . Despite the panics and depressions of the eighteen nineties , its population increased 144 per cent to 28,339 , faster than that of any other town in the country . At the turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its steel and iron works and rod , wire , nail , and tinplate mills . The town proudly boasted having the largest tinplate mills in the world , and its rapid growth attracted several consumers ' goods industries . Youngstown , Ohio , to-day 's number three steel town , was then only a flyspeck on the economic map of the industry , and Gary , Indiana , to-day 's number two steel town , still a swampy marsh along Lake Michigan . New Castle seemed destined to become the very center of the new steel world , until Billy Patterson retired and the town fell into the hands of a stepfather . In 1898 J. P. Morgan &; Company bought every important New Castle steel works , and apparently obtained from their previous owners an agreement not to reinvest their profits in steel works in New Castle that would compete with the billion-dollar Steel Trust ? at least , suchwere the results . Seventy-four years old , Billy Patterson gracefully retired . All the other important steel men in town , except George Greer , moved away or invested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Steel put in charge of the tinplate mills , invested his money in the LaBelle Iron Works at Steubenville , Ohio , and in other firms throughout the country . Thus ended the expansion of the steel industry in New Castle . For a while a few enterprising local business men tried to carry on the tradition of an ever-growing industrial community . But the people soon learned that their town was no longer run by local men ; New Castle 's new boss was an absentee owner . That boss was Judge Elbert H. Gary . His first act was to throw fifteen hundred rod , wire , and nail mill workers on the streets , blame it on " labor trouble , " and merge the rod , wire , and nail mills with similar operations elsewhere . It was soon evident that New Castle 's absentee owner was not interested in developing the town but only in U. S. Steel 's interests as a whole . Ruinous competition of Welsh tinplate having been eliminated by the McKinley Protective Tariff on tinplate , that to this day gives American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S. Steel then settled down to making handsome profits from the New Castle tinplate mills until 1937 , when technology made them obsolete . Judge Gary acted on the idea that ownership of the steel and tinplate works entitled U. S. Steel to control the town . The results were soon evident . A glass company , founded in New Castle in 1849 , moved to West Virginia . John Stevenson , Jr. , who had played an important role in developing New Castle 's tinplate works , dismantled his stately stone mansion on Lincoln Avenue overlooking New Castle ; piece by piece he moved it twenty miles up the Shenango Valley to Sharon , where the mansion was reconstructed . In South Sharon Stevenson erected a large tinplate works , but as soon as it was completed the powerful U. S. Steel combine bought it , built a company town round the works , and named them the Farrell Works and Farrell , Pennsylvania , in honor of James A. Farrell , one of U. S. Steel 's ranking officers . Now only one force ? the labor unions ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His efforts to exterminate the trade unions in the tinplate mills failed in 1901 because of an esprit de corps pervading the workers and management . Behind this harmonious condition was a long tradition of collective bargaining that the skilled Welsh and English workers brought with them and that had been in practice in the New Castle mills from their beginning . George Greer , the manager of the tinplate mills , refused to round up a gang of strikebreakers . With head always erect , sharp eyes , and a distinguished goatee , Greer was a man of forceful independence and did not fit into Gary 's military type of organization . But he was such an indispensable operating man that Gary was not free to oust him until July , 1908 . The following July , 1909 , Gary handed the tinplate workers ' union an ultimatum to disband . Having seen the pottery workers ' union shattered to bits three years earlier , the tinplate workers received the Judge 's ultimatum stoically and closed down the mills . The pottery strike had shaken up New Castle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was plainly observable to the townsfolk that U. S. Steel was behind the pottery firm . With Greer safely retired to his farm where he raised Shorthorn Durham cattle , Judge Gary imported strikebreakers and broke the strike in six months . Not until the rise of the C.I.O. in 1937 were New Castle 's tinplate workers organized again . Anger , especially among the workers , turned into a spirit of revenge . In 1911 the town elected a Socialist Mayor , Walter V. Tyler , who was a railroad brakeman . A split between the " wets " and " drys " facilitated the Socialist victory , but their capture of the city council was clean cut . Judge Gary 's followerslost no time in getting the Republican legislature in Harrisburg to rip out the council of fifteen members elected on a ward basis that proved hard to control , and to install a commission form of government with only four councilmen . The local paper editorialized : . . . the bitterness and desire for revenge that led up to the election of a minority mayor have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tolerance for the views of others .. . found expression in this election . The humble editor of the town 's paper was telling Judge Gary that the workers had elected a Socialist Mayor to get even with him for taking their union from them . Mayor Tyler did a valiant job while his term lasted . Judge Gary saw that he never got another one . And when Walter V. Tyler was elected to city council in 1928 as a Republican he symbolized U. S. Steel 's domination of every phase of New Castle 's life . III Before World War I intervened , there were omens of New Castle 's economic decline . In 1912 a stamping and enameling company failed . The next year , Youngstown , Ohio , already overshadowing its rival as a steel town , gleefully reported in the Youngstown Vindicator : With . . . the wealth of the city tied up principally in banking and other private financial interests , New Castle gradually commenced to feel the effects of its wealthy men 's inactivity . Merchants . . . interested in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit shown by the home capitalists of Youngstown who on selling their stock to the combine U. S. Steel . . organized . . . independent companies . But . . New Castle dollars went . to promote gold mines in the west , to build oil refineries in other parts . . . with little concern for the industrial advancements at home . The effects of this spirit were bound to bring bad results . The bad results were postponed by the War , throughout which New Castle prospered . U. S. Steel added seven hundred and fifty more tinplate workers to its rolls , restoring half the number of jobs it had eliminated a decade earlier . The wheels of industry hummed until the advent of the post-war depression , from which New Castle has never recovered . Like its rise , New Castle 's fall has been phenomenal . During the prosperous twenties its population increased only eight per cent while the nation 's population rose sixteen per cent . The Chamber of Commerce became alarmed about the loss of industries and jobs by 1927 and hired experts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed : . . . You have . .. lost a number of plants . . . . The time has come for . . a program that will cover a period of the next few years . You are in real competition when you land an industry these days . . . . The program we recommend is ; REPLACE LOST INDUSTRIES . . . the Car Works , the Rubber Plant , the Baking Company , the Knitting Mill , the Brewery , and the Stove Works ( all left town ) . The Engineering Works in 1920 . . . had 452 employees . . . . During the summer of 1927 they had 66 . . . It does seem as though there would be some way to save this important industry for New Castle .. . . Spurred on by the loss of these firms that employed 3,340 workers , the Chamber started a campaign late in 1927 to replace them . Not a single new firm was brought to town by 1930 when the depression set in . Gone was Billy Patterson and the spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's days he would solicit New Castle business men to subscribe for stock in a new firm to take over the bankrupt one , and loaned the money to those subscribers who could not raise it on the spot . New Castle 's absentee overlord had long since snuffed out this enterprising spirit . When the car works closed early in the twenties and threw two thousand men on the streets , for instance , U. S. Steel did nothing . But the Chamber 's drive to replace New Castle 's lost industries failed ignominiously because the townsfolk expected that U. S. Steel was going to expand its New Castle operations and employ more workers . An officer of one of the pottery firms in town told us : In the twenties U. S. Steel bought a large tract of land adjacent to its property , and built a modern power plant with a much greater capacity than its operations required . Everyone assumed that the land was purchased and the enlarged power plant erected to take care of the open hearth furnaces and coke plant the Corporation was going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Chamber was unduly alarmed about the loss of jobs , and that U. S. Steel " would take care of Ncw Castle . " As a consequence , the Chamber 's drive fell flat because the townsfolk did not get behind it . Not until 1931 , when U. S. Steel abandoned its Bessemer steel works , throwing twelve hundred workers on the streets , did the townsfolk suspect that the company would not take care of New Castle . Some clung to the hope that the Bessemer steel works would reopen after the depression , although informed steel men knew that it was the vielim of technological advances in the use of open-hearth steel where Bessemer was formerly used . In 1935 the works was dismantled ; Bessemer steel had declined from sixty-seven per cent of the steel produced in 1900 to less than ten per cent . Technology dealt New Castle a body blow . The Chamber 's ill-fated program was revived . By 1937 ten new industries employing 950 workers were brought to New Castle , and its future seemed less hopeless . But only for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came a second blow : U. S. Steel permanently abandoned the Greer tinplate works , displacing fifteen hundred workers . Thoroughly alarmed now , the townsfolk suddenly got visions of a " ghost " town . The Mayor led a committee of leading citizens to the Pittsburgh office of U. S. Steel . " Why did n't you build your continuous strip mill in New Castle , which has the workers to man it and the community facilities to serve the workers , instead of building it in the wilderness of Irvin , Pennsylvania ? " the committee asked . The reply , in effect , was : " We would have liked to honor New Castle with the Irvin strip mill , but we had to protect the interests of our stockholders . We can produce at Irvin anywhere from five to ten dollars a ton cheaper than we could in New Castle . Irvin is on the Monongahela River , interconnected by our own railroad with the Edgar Thompson works that supplies it with semifinished steel . Our Clairton by-product coke ovens are nearby and they supply Irvin with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cheap water transportation down the Ohio River , as well as of our own railroad , to ship our finished products from Irvin . You understand , gentlemen , that building in New Castle was out of the question because of its disadvantageous geographic location . It is an inland town . Transportation costs in and out of New Castle are prohibitive . " All hope of U. S. Steel expansion in New Castle was gone . The committee returned home disheartened . The townsfolk agitated for a canal from Lake Erie to the Ohio River , but their hopes for cheap transportation were soon drowned in the failure of the canal project . Geography had dealt New Castle another blow as a heavy industry town . Iv Merritt Reynolds , a handsome , trim boy in his late teens , graduated as president of the 1939 New Castle High School class of 601 young men and women . Chosen with the other officers of the class as the most likely to succeed , he hunted for a job , any kind of work , put his application in at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The auto repair shop located in the stables of Billy Patterson 's old mansion did n't need any help . " Ca n't use anybody , " he heard at the bronze plant , the potteries , the chemical works , everywhere he went . There was no use trying at the lone remaining tinplate mills , " ' cause there 's hundreds of tinplate men from the old Greer mills walkin ' the streets . " All Merritt Reynolds could find was a jobas an extra usher in a movie house . Unable to make out on his part-time earnings , he went to the Knitting Mills building , now occupied by the relief offices . Here Merritt got his first opportunity , a chance to go to a CCC camp in Arizona . He took it , gladly . Only one officer of the 1939 class got a job ? as a bell hop at a hotel on strike by the A. F. of L. A year after graduating , the president of the 1938 class was still unemployed . The rank and file of the graduates found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1937 three out of ten went on to school , two got jobs , while five out of Len could not find work . 554 graduated in 1938 . Six out of ten joined the unemployed , two went on to school , and two got jobs . High School authorities will not know what happened to the 1939 class until next year , but one school official said : " The 1939 graduates are not competing for private jobs , there are none to compete for , but fighting to get into the CCC . " Among the workers who once had a job despair is ghastly , hope more forlorn . " I 'm whipped , " a $15 a day tinplate worker told us a few days after he was furloughed from a $3.20 a day WPA job in August . " / ca n't snake a livin ' any more . The hand-mills are through . They 're turnin ' out more tinplate pushin ' buttons in these strip mills than the whole lot of us could roll . I use ' to make good money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our home when we were married , got it all paid for , and now ca n't meet the taxes .

My youngest boy ca n't get in the CCC camp ' cause we ai n't on relief , and ca n't get on . What 's the use o ' talkin ' ! How about settin ' a fellow up to a glass of beer ? " Seven thousand families , sixty-four per cent of New Castle 's population , are in the same boat . Few have the money to go elsewhere to seek a job , and those who do only discover that private industry is not expanding to take up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HAIRCUT ? Two- ? ITS " is painted on the window of a barber shop in the workers ' section of town . The barber explained : " I charged the regular price until a few months ago , but I could n't make out . My good customers did n't have the cash and charged it . I did their work because I had nothing else to do and to keep them as customers if things ever pick up around this place . I was about forced to close the shop when my wife gave me an idea . She said , Nobody has any money , but they can always scrape up fifteen cents to go to a show . Why do n't you cut out the charge accounts and make everyone pay ten cents for a shave and fifteen cents for a haircut ? ' That 's just what I did , and I 've taken in enough cash the last two months to keep the wolf from the door . " A Main Street dentist told us that his paying practice has almost vanished , that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and did n't know whether he would ever be able to send him back . " There is n't any question about it , " an official of the Retail Merchants ' Association said ; " government moneyWPA , Relief , Unemployment Compensation , CCC , and the rest ? is keeping most of our merchants out of the bankruptcy courts to-day . Last week this was in July WPA laid off a lot of men , and all the merchants complained irmhediately that their sales dropped off . " Indeed , the main spigot of cash in New Castle is no longer private payrolls , but government money . At the rate of expenditures for the first eight months of this year , the Federal and State governments were pouring $3,246,000 yearly into town . On September 1 , 1939 , 28 per cent of New Castle 's population , * listed as 3,146 cases , were drawing State relief ; 8 per cent , 952 cases , unemployment compensation ; another 8 per cent , 900 cases , on WPA rolls ; and still . another 8 per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were waiting to be accepted . Fifty-two per cent of New Castle is dependent upon government aid for subsistence . or on the verge of it . Another 12 per cent , 1,338 cases , consisting in the main of recently displaced tinplate workers who were high wage earners , are registered at the State Employment Office as unemployed . Before being eligible for relief a worker must prove himself a pauper , and these workers will eventually join the relief rolls when their savings are exhausted . " Let your Castle and my Castle be New Castle ! " With this slogan officers of the Pennsylvania Power Company , subsidiary of the Commonwealth &; Southern utility empire , appealed to the workers , business men , and professional people to pull New Castle out of the mire . Thus the Greater New Castle Association was born last winter . For political reasons ? certainly not for economic ones ? the utility company built a three and one-half million dollar power plant in town , completed this year . The utility company officers frankly admitted that their interest in the Association @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their large losses of industrial and home power customers and to protect their new investment ; and they were quick to emphasize that the welfare of the townsfolk coincided with the utility company 's interests . Everyone , no matter what his station in life , was invited to join the Association , which raised thirty thousand dollars and hired an executive director and economic experts within a few weeks . The Association 's first circular ex-plained : . . We lost between 1920 and 1939 eleven industries , employing 5,340 workers ; we lost through decline in operations 700 workers , or a total of 6,040 . We gained in new industries ten . . .. These placed 950 back on employment payrolls , and the expansion of existing industries . . . added 920 more , so we have gained 1,870 employees , but our net loss is 4,170 employees . . . . . the payroll loss due to industrial decline is conservatively estimated at $5,000,000 or 28% per cent . . .. What we need is jobs at supportable wages . . . . " But before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had to obligate itself to pay one per cent of the $250,000 annual payroll of the pants company that threatened to leave town and throw four hundred workers out of work . This subsidy saved the four hundred jobs , for the moment , and in hailing its victory the Association announced hopes of " increasing ( New Castle 's ) payroll in 1939 " by a quarter of a million dollars . Then a bombshell burst . In mid-July U. S. Steel closed the Shenango tinplate works , its sole remaining New Castle operation . Three thousand workers were thrown on the streets . A yearly payroll of five million dollars was lost . New Castle 's loss in private employment since 1920 climbed to 7,170 , and its annual payroll for the same period fell another five million to seven and one-half million dollars , a fifty-seven per cent drop . Technology dealt the town a third and , this time , devastating blow . Private industry that once employed 11,295 workers now takes care of only 4,071 , a drop of sixty-four per cent . Just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Castle by cutting WPA wages five dollars a month and reducing WPA jobs from 1,900 in May to 900 in September . Certainly the Association 's goal to increase the industrial payroll in 1939 by one-twentieth of the loss of the Shenango works payroll demonstrates its helplessness to cope with the combination of forces that have wrecked the economic life of the town . V Unable to help itself , forgotten by private industry , fed meager relief by the State government , ignored by the Roosevelt Administration , and abused by the 76th Congress , New Castle has been revived by World War H. Its revival , however , is partial and temporary . On October 2 , 1939 , the huge Shenango tinplate works swung open its doors and 2,500 workers rushed in , eager to get back to work . The war-born prosperity is bringing joy into twenty-five hundred homes ; eventually there will be another five hundred when the full contingent of Shenango workers returns . But the hopes of four thousand other New Castle families have not yet turned into joy , nor are they likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be aided , and the potteries , the bronze plant , and other firms will pick up , the war boom will still leave at least one-third of Ncw Castle 's population dependent upon government aid . Furthermore , Shenango 's reopening is to be brief . " This is the last lap for the hand-mills , " an official of U. S. Steel told us . Strip mills , on the average , produce tinplate fifteen dollars a ton lower than the hand-mills . Under ordinary conditions the capacity of the strip mills is more than enough to meet demands , and if the extraordinary demands are sustained , strip capacity will be increased instead of high-cost obsolete mills being operated indefinitely . In either case , Shenango will he closed as quickly as it has been reopened , and for the last time . Ghost town is New Castle 's destiny . A similar fate awaits more than a score of other steel towns . Technologically displaced workers who have been idle for almost two years-1,500 in Yorkville , Ohio ; 1,100 in Elwood , Indiana ; .1,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are breathlessly awaiting an announcement that their abandoned mills will reopen . The announcement may come , hilt the odds are that the war boom will leave these ghost towns untouched . Obsolete mills in a dozen more steel towns ? employing 900 in Apollo , Pennsylvania ; 1,000 in Follansbee , West Virginia ; 2,500 in Newport , Kentucky ; and thousands more elsewhere ? have taken a new lease on life ; their workers new hopes and aspirations . When the war boom collapses these mills will fold up with a terrific crash . And the post-war depression will shake the foundations of another score of steel towns , like Farrell and Vandergrift , Pennsylvania , each employing twenty-five hundred workers , and Massillon , Ohio , with three thousand steel workers , to such an extent that their only destiny can be that of New Castle . Technology takes its toll not only of workers , but of entire mills and complete towns . The new steel technology means more than a slow elimination of workers ; it is wholesale displacement . A hand-mill is a hot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers waiting about while others relieve them for short periods at the furnaces . In one such mill of this character the " iron " is handled more than fifty times by tongs and hands before the process is finished . In a modern strip mill all this vanishes . The place is cool and spacious . A few workers , some scattered about in overhead control booths pushing buttons , handle the " iron " in one operation . Here a huge slab as big as a mattress but weighing several thousand pounds is automatically released from a furnace , rolled into a coil a thousand feet long like a thread on a spool , placed on a conveyor and put through more continuous operations until it is cut into sheets for your automobiles or plates ( later tinned ) for your canned soup . All the horde of men who once were employed in the making of steel are swept away , leaving a few watchful men guarding controls . And all those swept away are piled up in the scattered steel towns , wondering what next . Certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The unsound social and economic structure of the steel towns remains unchanged . Absentee overlords continue free to legis late their economic future , and that of other basic industry towns , without any responsibility for the social and political effects of such legislation . Throughout the nation there are scores of industrial towns dominated by one industry or large corporation that are now prosperous , but doomed to economic destruction by the same forces that have razed the economic life of Ncw Castle . These forces , like mass unemployment and the country 's other more obvious economic ills , will be more ugly and difficult of solution when the boom and its allaying effects are over . In addition , the maladjustments in our economic machinery , as during World War I , are being aggravated by the war-born recovery , after which our task of domestic reconstruction will be the same as in March , 1933 , only ten times greater . Gradually the American people as a whole will recover from the suddenness , enormity , and intellectual shock of World War II , and the immediate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provoked , to realize with Carl Sandburg , poet and biographer of Abraham Lincoln , " that in this hour mankind 's greatest need is a common agreement on the causes and conditions that have produced idlers at the top and bottom of society . " And that such an agreement will . . . have to consider the vast mass of unspeakable , inarticulate , woebegone human tragedy gathered under the head of that hideous but accurate phrase from the science of economics , " the technologically disemployed " ? the people whose jobs have been abolished and destroyed by machines and new industrial promises and transitions . . . . The purpose of the agreement will be to provide the basis for an " arrangement by which the idle rich and the idle poor could make a two-power pact to take care of each other " in a way that no war boom can possibly do .
