In the Annals of Surgery last week , Drs . Vilray Papin Blair and Louis T. Byars of St. Louis , Mo . told how they made a finger out of a toe . The patient was a pretty two-year-old girl who had accidentally lost the top joint of the middle finger of her right hand . It was not easy . <P> First the doctors flexed the child 's right knee , bound her forearm to her leg with adhesive tape and tied her hand over her foot . Then they cut her second toe two-thirds of the way around , so that it opened on a hinge of live tissue . Then they fitted the bones together so that the last joint and a half of the toe capped the second joint of the finger . Finally they peeled the skin off the finger tip and joined it to the cut end of the toe , carefully matching the tendons and stitching them together . <P> The child remained in this cramped position for four weeks while finger and toe grew together , supplied by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that bound the toe to the foot , carefully covered the stump with skin . The toe-finger was protected with a leather jacket until completely healed . <P> At present , said the doctors , the new finger has good color , good circulation . The child can not flex it completely , but it is gradually growing more limber . And it looks more like a finger every day .
