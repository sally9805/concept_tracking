txt WASHINGTON , Aug. ** of the Republican and Democratic National Committees assayed the record of the first session , Eightieth Congress , in prepared statements today and found no grounds for agree-4 ment . Carroll Reece , the Republican chairman , maintained that the first Republican-controlled Congress in sixteen years has kept " every single one " of the party 's 1946 campaign pledges within its power . Gael Sullivan , cxecutive director of the Democratic committee , assailed such claims as " doublet talk " and " false . " He was especially critical of a speech made Thursday night by Senator Robert A. Taft of Ohio , Republican policy chief of the Senate and a Presidential possibility . " Part of the format of every socalled statement on the Eightieth Congress , " Mr. Sullivan said , " is a long sequence of double talk , false claims , smears of all Government workers , even cheap personal attacks at the President . All of these things marked Senator Taft 's approach to the subject . " While Mr. Sullivan was naming eight fields in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the campaign promises that his party , he said , had kept . The Republicans cut " several billions " of dollars from President Truman 's budget and could have cut more if Mr. Truman had kept his promise to cooperate , Mr. Reece said . They twice passed a bill to reduce personal income taxes , but both measures were killed by vetoes of " High Tax Harry , " he asserted . They enacted a labor control bill // " despite the hysterical veto " of the President , he stated . They protected the interests of war veterans , he stated , by " a series of constructive bills , " including one authorizing cash payments of enlisted men 's terminal leave bonds over the opposition of John W. Snyder , Secretary of the Treasury . By strong pressure to rid the Government of Communists , the Republicans induced Mr. Truman to announce " a ' purge ' of subversivonists on the Federal payroll , " he contended . Finally , Mr. Reece stated , the Republican Congress promptly submitted to the states a Constitutional amendment to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On top of all these things the majority party continued to give " patriotic cooperation " to the Administration in ft ign affairs " despite all the irritations caused by Mr. Truman 's attempts to sabotage the Republican legislative program in the domestic field , " he added . " However , " he said , " it must be stated in all frankness that such cooperation would be much easier if the Administration Would go a little further toward giving the nation an accurate and comprehensive picture of its plans . " Mr. Reece 's statement was in the form of a letter to more than 14,000 party officials and leaders of the country . Mr. Sullivan , in a statement sent to the press , asserted that " in the final analysis the record of the Congress is in its failures to act . " As " things they did not do " he listed the following : " They did nothing to curb inlationary prices . " They did nothing on flood control except with a patchwork program . " Nothing on minimum wages . " Nothing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the nation to defend our nation . " Nothing to improve the educational level of the nation . " Nothing on a department of welfare . " Nothing to improve the medical care of all the people . " President Truman requested legislation to meet all of those problems , but by failing to act Congress itself utilized " typical Republican vetoes , the vetoes of inaction and reaction , " he asserted . Taft Accused of Slurs Mr. Sullivan conceded that Congress did make an effort to handle foreign policy on a nonpartisan basis , and " in general the record was good . " " Yet Taft with a heavy foot strode forth to speak of unity but created disunity by slurs at the nonpartisan foreign policy , " he added . " There should be no partisan politics at so crucial a period in our relations with other nations and I hope that Senator Taft will not be the one to shatter our own national unity in the face of this atomic age and its terrifying problems . " Mx . Sullivan also attacked Senator Taft and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by failing to obtain Senate action on President Truman 's appointments to the National Labor Relations Board under the TaftHartley labor law . He ridiculed Mr. Taft 's assertion of the " wild claim " that the President 's budget had been cut by $3,000,000,000 . The most careful and accurate estimates available show actual reductions of only $1,267,000,000 , " and these relatively small cuts were only achieved by a meat-axe approach that saw unreasoning cuts in such things as the school lunch program , " he said . Moreover , Mr. Sullivan contended , Congress was guilty of fiscal strumbling and bumbling in its handling of appropriations bills by failing to have any of the twelve major supply bills ready at the end of the 1947 fiscal year and letting most of them remain pending until late in July . " Taft said time was necessary to get his inexperienced Congress under way , " Mr. Sullivan asserted . " The fact is it never got under way . "                    @
