It 's a fine old American custom ? going to lectures . It was already well established when the Secretary of the Waltham , Mass. , Lyceum wrote to Emerson inviting him to lecture before the group and offering an " honorarium " of five dollars . Emerson accepted the invitation , too , but with the stipulation that he be allowed four quarts of oats for his horse ! Going to a lecture is as American as apple pie , corn pudding , and a one-family house with two bathrooms . It is a national habit and one that foreigners simply do not comprehend . They do not realize that basically it is part of our way of life , that it is one of the bulwarks of our democracy and of our culture . We Americans go to lectures for a variety of reasons . Some go because it is the thing to do in the community . Some go chiefly because it is an activity sponsored by a group of which they are members . Some go , perhaps , because they have nothing else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe , for the simple reason that we want to know . We Americans are curiousminded . We are still young , as a nation and as a people . We are like the small boy with his everlasting " What ? " and " What for ? " and " Why ? " We go to lectures because we have discovered we can learn faster that way . Lewis Mumford in an hour 's lecture can give us a rough general outline of the main theses of his latest book , The Condition of Man ? a major work that would take us many hours ' plodding reading to master . H. R. Knickerbocker can give us in an hour 's talk a vivid eyewitness account of major battles and politically important conferences . Colonel Carlos P. Romulo can make us proud of our America and set us to thinking very seriously about the whole complicated problem of colonies . And if the speaker has not made some point clear to us , at the end of his talk we can ask him what he meant , or we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting discussion . We can , that is , if we are members of a well-organized forum or other sponsoring group seriously interested in the lecture as a lively form of adult education . A public lecture that is not followed by a lively question-andanswer period is incomplete . An American audience ? if it does not number more than about 1,500 ? has a right to ask " What ? " and " What for ? " and " Why ? " We Americans go to lectures because we are gregarious and because we like to talk things over . Although we are not brilliant conversationalists , we have discovered that good talk is one of the most exciting and rewarding things in the world . " A lecture , " declared Matthew Arnold after one of his tours in this country , " is a conversation between a speaker and an audience . " That definition is the best that has been set down , even though it would not satisfy a- lexicographer . It is the best because it implicitly indicates the participation of the audience . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is delivered from a platform before an audience . Until it is delivered , until it becomes " a conversation between a speaker and an audience , " it is only a set of notes , a script , a carefully conceived outline . It is a dead thing ;  | it comes to life only when the audience participates . You heard a good lecture last night ? Then take some credit , because you helped to make it good . You heard a poor lecture at your club last week ? Then ' take some of the blame , because you helped to make it poor . You listened to the lecture , did n't you ? Or did you ? Perhaps you were there , but your mind was planning the menu for Sunday dinner . Perhaps you could n't keep your eyes off Mrs. So-and-So 's hat and your thoughts off a bit of gossip concerning her and young Mr. So-and-Sum . Perhaps you could n't help worrying about the month 's bills , or the report from Peggy 's school , or how to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you see ? If you are present at a lecture and not listening , you are not maintaining your share of the conversation . And if many of you are not listening , the speaker sags off psychologically . Then there may be created a sort of vacuum , in which the speaker goes through his motions and you go through yours , but nothing happens . You of the audience have been deprived of a stimulating experience . Of course , it is not all your fault . The speaker may be to blame , but the chances are that he has done his best . He is , in all probability , an honest man , and he has something to say that he thinks is important ? so important that he is willing to endure the inconvenience and fatigue of travel for the opportunity to say it . There are some bores , and there are a few charlatans and hypocrites ; but in general American lecture audiences get the lectures they deserve . As a member of one of the oldest lecture forums in this country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as his audience permits him to be . " H OW can you improve the lecture : H in your community ? How can yot profit most from them ? What is the best way to listen ? There are no hard-andfast rules or regulations , but here are suggestions that will help you get greater enjoyment , benefit , and stimulation from the lectures that will be given in you community during the coming months . 1 . Know something of the subject to be discussed . Do n't cram , schoolboy fashion or attempt to read all the books the speaker may have written . But familiarize yourself with the subject in a genera way . You can organize your own thinking on the subject . You can tidy up you mind , as you would tidy up the living room when you are expecting a caller . 2 . Find out something about the speaker . Who is he and what has he done that gives him the privilege of addressing you ? This should not be difficult i your program publicity committee is on its job . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greater you initial interest in him is likely to be . It is on the foundation of this initial interes that good lecture evenings are built . 3 . Be on time and plan to stay . Late corners are lecture liabilities . They disturb the audience and the speaker . Early goers , of course , are worse . 4 . When the speaker appears , welcom him with moderate applause . Do n't wait until he has been introduced , but giv him a hand before the chairman has had  | a chance to embarrass him . You will be surprised to find how good this is for your morale ? and for the speaker 's : Did yon ever walk out on a lecture platform an 1 see nothing but a lot of alien people looking at you , hear nothing but pin , dropping all over the place ? It is as disheartening as ice water ! 5 . Then listen . That 's all you have to do . Sounds simple and easy , does n't it ? Well . it 's not , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it is not exhausting , and it is rewarding : Concentrate . That is , really , the only way to listen to a lecture . Say to yourself : " This man has something to say ? perhaps he has something to say to me . What is it ? ? ' Follow the development of the speaker 's thought . Set down in your own mind the outline , point by point , as the speaker develops it . 6 . Keep an open mind . Make yourself maintain the attitude of learning . Do n't let disagreement about some statement block off all that is said . Give the speaker a fair hearing , reserving to yourself , as a free woman in a free country , the right to disagree , to question . 7 . Take part in the discussion period . Take a listener 's part or ask a question . Make your question as simple and direct as possible . And do n't , for heaven 's sake . preface it with a summary of the lecture ? or any part of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the lecture . Talk about it with your friends . If the speaker made his subject come alive for you , keep it alive . Transplant it to your own mental garden and watch it flourish .  |
