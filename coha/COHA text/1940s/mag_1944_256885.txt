One evening last month , NBC-tuned citizens of Holyoke , Mass , rose abruptly from their radios , rushed to a vacant lot at Prospect and Walnut Streets , and began digging frantically with knives , spoons , shovels or any implements they had . One man brought a bulldozer . Within an hour , two of the diggers unearthed 500 silver dollars apiece , and the lot looked as if it had been bombed . <P> This stampede made a newspaper sensation-to the immense gratification of Ralph Edwards , publicity-minded M.C. of radio 's Truth or Consequences program . There was more to the story-a preface and an epilogue . <P> A Man in the House . Months before , Edwards had asked his studio audience a pointless query : " Is there a Mr. Wickel in the house ? " The M.C. liked his little joke , repeated it , and in time it became a standard gag line . Then , on November 4 , there was a Mr. Wickel in the house : listeners heard a meek response from a Verona , N.J. mechanical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the occasion , promptly announced that $1,000 awaited Mr. Wickel 's shovel in the Holyoke lot . Mr. Wickel joined the gold rush , but failed to find the money . <P> After the ensuing stampede , and after promising to make a park of the ruined lot and put a bust of Mr. Wickel in it , Edwards presented mild , bespectacled , disappointed Mr. Wickel with a check for $1,000 . But there was no bank name on the check . Nevertheless , Mr. Wickel finally cashed it , at his own bank : - and received $1,000 in Confederate money . Asking for something more negotiable , he got a 1,400-lb. safe containing a little less than half of a $1,000 bill . <P> Pecky Takes Over . Still amiable , Mr. Wickel asked for the rest of the bill , was informed that a white parrot named Pecky could tell , if it would . Stiffened with mike fright fortnight ago , it would n't . <P> Mr. Wickel took Pecky home , wooed it doggedly while phone calls , letters and wandering curiosity-seekers offered suggestions . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nellie , " " Lily , " " Ken . " Less amiable by now , Mr. Wickel shipped the bird back to Edwards . <P> Last week , one of the longest running gags and one of the most successful promotion stunts in radio history wore itself out . From Chicago , where it had been shipped for Saturday 's show , the parrot 's " Ken " was enlarged to " Ken I 'm No " and this was interpreted ( by reading backwards ) to mean : " On my neck . " In NBC 's New York studios , Mr. Wickel smiled grimly when Edwards promised to mail the money between Pages 12 and 13 of a book . <P> Reading Matter . But Edwards found it impossible to give up without one last cute touch. * He cut New York off the program and took a nation of listeners into his gleeful confidence . <P> " Now here is where you folks listening come in on the gag , " he confided . " Every one of you listening also mail a book to Mr. Wickel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Army trucks will cart them away to the Victory Book Campaign headquarters . . . . Mr. Wickel will be searching for Page 13s until the cows come home . ... I can just see his face . . . . "
