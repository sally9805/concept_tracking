txt Recommendations by Mayor O'Dwyer , calling for an upward revision of his proposed executive ' budget of $857,131,849 for 1946-47 by the inclusion of additional appropriations totaling between $7,500,000 and $8,000,000 were unanimously approved yesterday by the Board of Estimate at an executive meeting at which about $7,000,000 in a lump sum was provided to cover supplementary increases in the pay of city employes . The other appropriations were for an additional $100,000 to purchase books for the New York Public Library and for other minor adjustments in non-personnel allocations . Inclusion of the additional appropriations will not , however , increase the proposed executive budget by an equal amount , because the board also approved minor reductions in other appropriations , including charges in connection with La Guardia Field and the Idlewild Airport in Queens which will be taken over by the newly created New York City Airport Authority about Oct. 1 . Further Increase Possible Before the Board of Estimate formally adopts a budget at its meeting next Thursday it must decide whether or not to add another substantial sum to provide for pay rises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system , whose demands for increases are now under advisory arbitration before the special committee appointed by the Mayor and headed by Arthur S. Meyer , chairman of the State Board of Mediation . Any pay rise recommended by the committee may have to be cared for in the 1046-47 budget , because revenues of the city transit system may not be sufficient to // take care of operating expenses ' for that fiscal year . If the Board ' of Estimate elects to make budgetary provision for a pay rise may have to provide an additional sum , perhaps as much as $10,000 , - 000 . If the Board of Estimate fails to anticipate a transit pay rise in its 1946-47 budget it may become necessary some time during the fiscal year to ask the Legislature to authorize a reopening of the budget unless the city chooses to resort to deficit financing for which allowance can be made in the budget for 1947-48 . The pay rises recommended by the Mayor and approved by the board are in addition to the $15 , - 000,000 of pay increases , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executive budget . Opposition to the additional pay rises was expressed by the Citizens Budget Commission , which issued a statement declaring that " taxpayers were stunned " by the report that they would be granted . The shock was eased , the commission declared , by a growing disbelief in the accuracy of the estimate that the additional increases might total as much as $15,000,000 . The Real Estate Board of New York also objected to the proposed pay rises , declaring that " they should not be made just for political expediency or because of organized pressure . " In any event , the board maintained , such increases will place an unjustified burden on the real estate taxpayer . Before the poard of Estimate met to consider the Mayor 's recommendations it had before it a plea by the Citizens ' Union for an increase of the appropriation for the City Planning Commission from the $263,640 fixed in the proposed budget to $303,981 . The extra funds , according to the Citizens Union , are required to staff the commission properly . The Board of Estimate will consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robert Moses , City Construction Coordinator , recommending drastic revision of the 1946 capital budget by deferring for at least three or four years about $953,000,000 of city projects already planned or in the planning process . The same recommendations will be considered by the City Planning Commission at a closed meeting on Wednesday . In his report Mr. Moses declared that these projects would probably have to be deferred even longer unless the city 's financial picture is changed by the adoption of a higher transit fare . A protest against the Moses program was sent to Mayor O'Dwyer by the United Parents Associations , which concentrated its opposition on the proposed reduction of the school construction program . The Moses program , according to Mrs. Rose Shapiro , president of the association , would cut the six-year post-war construction program for schools from ninety-five to thirty-one new school building projects .
