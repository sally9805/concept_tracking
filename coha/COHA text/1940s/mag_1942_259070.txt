Last week 's compilation of ship sinkings showed that from Jan. 1 , 1942 to Oct. 1 , 490 Allied ships had been sunk in the western and south Atlantic by Axis submarines ; from Oct. 1 to Dec. 20 only 65 more . This notable success in the Battle of the Atlantic was not gained in any single thrilling action . The following account of the labors of a U.S. convoy vessel ( given with a fictitious name ) tells something of how that success has been won : <P> The U.S.S. Angry turned her snub , sea-battered nose out into the grey wilderness of wintry Atlantic . Green water pounded the corvette 's narrow decks , doused her open bridge where the hooded skipper stood squinting into the mist . Now and then he gave a quiet command for relay to engine room , signalmen and the helmsman below . The Angry was heading back to sea , guarding another convoy of rusty freighters , laden with men and supplies for distant battlefronts . <P> As the sea grew rougher , Lieut . Commander Noah Adair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tighter over his red thatch , drew the voluminous coat closer around his tall , lanky frame . The bridge , where he stood swaying with the ship 's roll , was open to rain , wind and spray , except for a strip of canvas lashed to the rail and another strip overhead . <P> Beside the bridge , Signalman 1st Class Ralph Moore , pea jacket buttoned tight , watch cap pulled down over his ears , fiddled with a blinker signal . Beating his spray-flecked gloves together for warmth , Moore reported a destroyer 's signal to take up position in the escort . <P> " Right rudder 20 , " ordered the captain for relay to the helmsman . Over a speaking tube came the Iowa-sharp voice of John ( " Shanghai " ) Frajman , Machinist 's Mate 2nd Class : " Engines making one-oh-two revolutions , sir . " <P> Captain Adair nodded , ducked to miss a bath of chilling spray . <P> Since May 14 , when the first coastal convoy moved from a U.S. port with the Angry among its escort , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret destinations through seas where submarines hid . Two days out of every three , the Angry had been at sea . To bigger ships , to men in situations more readily recognizable as heroic , had gone the headlines and the medals . The Angry 's first task was to get each supply-chocked freighter through to safety ; its second , to sink U-boats . <P> Sturdy , well armed , and round-bottomed to wallow over the waves rather than cut through them , the Angry is a queer duck to be flying a U.S. ensign . Her 206-ft. length is shorter than a destroyer 's , longer than most cutters ' . In the Royal Navy , for which she was built in 1940 , she was classed as a corvette . When Britain gave the ship and five others like her to the U.S. last March , the U.S. Navy quickly changed her name and classed her with gunboats , since the U.S. has no corvette class .
