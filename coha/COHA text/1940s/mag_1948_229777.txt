It was a ceremonial week for art-loving Florentines . On the very same day that the city honored its most distinguished foreign citizen ( see above ) , fishwives , shopgirls , nuns , monks and scholars jammed the Piazza del Duomo . They had come to see the reinstallation of the famed Baptistery doors of the cathedral . Sculptor Ghiberti 's 15th Century doors , with their intricate panels , each like a separate , delicate canvas , for centuries had been the pride of Florence . Worthy of Paradise , Michelangelo had said , and all Florence had agreed . <P> But the corrosion of their bronze base had seeped through the pores in the gold leaf with which Ghiberti had covered them . Over the years , the doors had dulled , and even Florentines had come to despair that there was any gold left at all . <P> Two years ago , a bronze smelter named Bruno Bearzi set out to prove that there was . Instead of scraping the doors , as others had tried , he mixed a special solvent to wash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while the Baptistery choir sang and long trumpets blared , the curtains over the doors fell away . At the sight , women fell to their knees ; men wept . After all the years , Ghiberti 's doors glistened and gleamed once more as he had made them .
