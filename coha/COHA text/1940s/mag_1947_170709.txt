Not since Manila , on the eve of Pearl Harbor , had Douglas MacArthur granted an all-out press conference . So when the Supreme Commander finally consented to lunch with the Tokyo correspondents at their Shimbun Alley clubhouse last week , many Allied newsmen did not bother to bring paper or notebooks . But what MacArthur told them , for the record , kept them scribbling for an hour on napkins , chit books , and letters from home . The reverberations continued all week . <P> The MacArthur Doctrine amounted to the flat declaration that Japan was ready for a peace treaty ; that delay would further cripple the Japanese economy ( thus requiring mounting U.S. aid ) ; that for some time after the treaty Japan would need both steering and protection-and that this might well be a job for U.N . <P> Americans sensed ( though MacArthur had not told them much about it ) that the amazing results of the U.S. occupation of Japan were based on concepts far deeper than mere administrative efficiency . MacArthur the philosopher had touched deep chords in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said that the Japanese , disarmed and with a new constitution renouncing war , " are relying upon the advanced spirituality of the world to protect them . . . .

Yoshida cheered the statement that Japan was ready for a peace treaty . He deplored the idea of U.S. withdrawal afterwards : " We are having our battles with the Communists too , and we have a very dangerous enemy to the north . ...

For the Japanese who got a good look at the great Commander at the Shimbun Alley clubhouse , there were no reservations whatever . Said Yasokichi Akomoto , 32-year-old head bar steward who was an ack-ack gunner in Tokyo during the war : " He is a simple , gentle man . I have seen many Japanese generals . . . . They would have shouted and had men with guns standing guard for blocks around here . What he said was kind to the Japanese . I shall never again see such a great man . " <P> The waitresses were awed , said they could never repay the General for the great trust he showed in them : " All morning we expected someone to come and test the food he was to eat . We thought perhaps he feared we might poison him . No such test was made , and we are honored beyond belief .
