If the Battle of Waterloo was won on the playing fields of Eton , the Battle of Britain might have to be won on the ploughed fields of an island traditionally never more than a hop , skip &; amp ; a jump ahead of starvation . Into the fields last week Britain sent all her schoolchildren , rich &; poor alike . The farming problem was acute . <P> With savage shipping losses to counteract , every ounce of grain , every Brussels sprout ( see col. 1 ) was needed to keep the nation alive . Because farm hands had been conscripted into service or lured away by higher wages in war industries , the spring labor problem was put on the narrow shoulders of Britain 's moppets . They responded as heroically as they had when they were blitz messengers ; as industriously as when they were waste salvagers , as enthusiastically as when they were training themselves to become future airmen and nurses . <P> Nationwide regulations now provide a maximum ten-day farmwork " holiday " for children 12 to 14 , with special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farm-handing during this so-called holiday is set at 4d ( 8 ) to 8d an hour for boys , slightly less for girls . Slightly higher scales prevail for older boys already working on the land as Young Farmers and in summer hostels . <P> Junior Warriors . Meanwhile Government Youth Training Centers , greatly enlarged since pre-war days , teach British children leaving school at 14 the mastery of machine tools , the use of electric welding . The Church Lads Brigades learn how to fight fires and repair bomb damage . Others , given " the privilege of defending their homeland against invasion , " march and train with oldsters in the Home Guard . More than a million youngsters are on call for national service . Thousands of others learn navigation , signaling and aircraft identification in eager preparation for enlistment at 18 in the services . Most popular service-training organization is the Air Training Cadets , with 1,444 squadrons and 177,310 members . <P> The increasing load on childhood is not all to the good . Industry has absorbed more thousands than ever before and , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives authorities many a worry . Juvenile delinquency continues to rise ; petty larceny is a main complaint . Boys twelve years old have even been caught stealing soap . Plymouth gasped recently when it learned of a 14-year-old boy who stole money even though earning 9 a week , of another who drank nine pints of beer each night . <P> But the future rulers of Britain are bearing their full share of the war effort . Having , by Government policy , a complete freedom of choice in their work , they are learning duty and responsibility .
