txt Grief and anxiety sit down at many Thanksgiving tables today as they did in 1943 and in 1942 . Yet as we do not think it wrong to give thanks in normal years , each with their private tragedies for many thousands of families , we can still give thanks in a time of public crisis and tragedy . The first Presidential Thanksgiving proclamation was issued by Abraham Lincoln three months after the Battle of Gettysburg , and with many dreadful battles still to be fought before there came " the interposition of the Almighty Hand to heal the wounds of the nation and to restore it * * * to the full enjoyment of peace , harmony , tranquillity and union . " The first New England Thanksgiving , in 1621 , came in the fall of a year which had taken the lives of half of those who had landed on Plymouth Rock . There were empty chairs at that feast and solemn thoughts among those who feasted . So it has gone . In times of peace and abundant harvests we have rejoiced . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No one who thinks about the lovely old tradition of this day can doubt that those who are absent and in danger would like it to be observed with the kindly and cheerful ceremonies long associated with it . No one can doubt that even the dead , both the young who have fallen in this war and the old who have passed on according to the laws of life and death from which none is exempt , would wish today to be remembered as they were in happier days . There was a little boy with a red sled . His energy was remarkable , his appetite appalling . He was one of many million American boys , not all alike but alike in some respects we like to call American . Perhaps he is not at home this Thanksgiving . He may not come home . But the picture of him endures , and we save Thanksgiving for him , and in his honor . If he returns , and in most cases he will , he will be glad to know that the day has been continued . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We can be thankful that our free institutions can function in time of war . We can be thankful for victories , not in any spirit of vainglory but because they bring nearer an end of killing , the return of peace , the triumph of justice . We can be thankful for the harvests and for the natural wealth of the earth which have made us strong for battle and by God 's grace will make us strong for rebuilding after battle . We can be thankful because throughout the free nations there now seems to be a desire stroller than ever before to lift from humanity 's shoulders the crushing burden of war . It is not selfish for any of us to be as happy as we can today . Surely , the world will never be ruined by too much happiness . There is no profit in a long ? face and a bit of dry bread if we can manage an affectionate smile and a second helping of white meat . We are not forgetting our friends and kin who are in danger or in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with braver hearts , the task of doing all we can to help them .
