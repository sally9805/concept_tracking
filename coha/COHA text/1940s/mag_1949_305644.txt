People in Luxembourg like to give small parties at which the guests sit around and talk quietly about business and the weather . The Grand Duchess Charlotte rarely ever mingles with her guests ; at the receptions in her toylike palace , she prefers to remain secluded in a small side room . Last week Luxembourg , whose national motto is Mir welle bleiwe wat mir sin ( We want to stay as we are ) , suspected that its social life , at least , would not long bleiwe as it was . For Mrs. Perle Mesta , famed Washington hostess and new U.S. minister to the Grand-Duchy , arrived with plump aplomb , and her ideas of a good party were known to differ from those held in Luxembourg . <P> Minister Mesta was a little late getting to her post . When her Packard-borne party ( with a luggage-laden Ford in the vanguard ) motored from Paris to the border , they were stopped cold by strangely hostile frontier guards . After lengthy palaver , it appeared that Mrs. Mesta had picked the wrong country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's , but Belgium 's . Two miles away an official welcoming committee was waiting , all set with flowers and speeches . By the time the party finally found little Luxembourg , the welcoming committee had become discouraged and gone home . <P> Once inside the Grand-Duchy , the Mesta motorcade cruised about , unable to find the U.S. legation . At length , greeted by the squealing of several hundred well-voiced pigs at a nearby fair , Minister Mesta settled in her official residence . Even before arranging twelve photographs of her great &; good friend Harry Truman , she received the press in her brown &; ivory salon . " My President , " she said , " thinks you are very , very , terribly important . You may be small , but we have a saying in my country that precious pearls come in small packages . " <P> The minister , finding only a cook and a maid at her residence , forthwith made plans for hiring a butler , a chef , an assistant chef , a parlor maid , a chambermaid and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give a few parties to further international understanding . Said she : " I came for service . " Unfortunately , Grand Duchess Charlotte was out of the country , shooting grouse in Scotland , so the new minister could not even present her credentials . <P> On Mrs. Mesta 's first evening in Luxembourg , a torchlight procession , including a brass band , appeared beneath the legation 's windows . The band played Anchors Aweigh and the crowd sang a greeting to Madame la ministre . The bandleader made a speech , which was followed by the Star-Spangled Banner . The demonstrators marched off to Marching Through Georgia . Said Minister Mesta , looking after them from her front porch : " That was a real sweet thing for them to do . "
