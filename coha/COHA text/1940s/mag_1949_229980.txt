At the pre-arranged hour , the explosion occurred . . . <P> The taiga around the mountain was Illuminated by a golden radiance ; <P> The old mountain disappeared . . . <P> <P> These lines , by Soviet Poet Evgeny Do-matovsky , cropped up in a Moscow literary magazine last summer , before the world learned that Russia had developed her own atomic bomb . Last week the vanished mountain turned up again at an unexpected place-the United Nations . <P> Happiness &; Prosperity . In the Special Political Committee , Andrei Vishinsky was attacking the U.S. sponsored plan for atomic energy control , which calls for international ownership of all atomic energy production and rigid international inspection ( TIME , Nov. 7 ) . " If , unfortunately , and to our great regret , " said the Soviet Foreign Minister , Russian stockpiling of atom bombs " were necessary , we should have as many of these as we should need-no more and no less . " <P> But right now , added Vishinsky , Russia was utilizing atomic energy only for peaceful purposes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; we are cutting through the jungle and the tundra ; we are spreading life , happiness , prosperity and welfare in places where the human footstep has not been seen for a thousand years . " <P> U.S. Delegate John Hickerson sharply replied to Vishinsky : " Whether or not this is nonsense , I will not say . . . But if nations have devices in their possession which can level mountains , they also have in their possession devices which can level cities . . . Fissionable material can be converted . . . easily and almost instantaneously into bombs . . . " <P> <P> Monday &; Thursday . Well , replied Vishinsky in hurt tones , if the world did not believe in Russia 's peaceful intentions , inspectors could cross the Soviet borders and " smell the atomic materials , touch them , feel them , do anything they want or desire . " They could inspect " on Monday , then next Monday , then Thursday , let us say , then the following Thursday , then two weeks after that , or any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twelve o'clock , at five minutes past twelve , at ten minutes past twelve , at one o'clock , at one-fifteen , at one-thirty , because you do n't believe us , because we are thieves . . . " <P> All of Vishinsky 's rhetoric did not change the fact that Russia had not retreated from her previous stand which ) opposes international ownership of all atomic energy plants ; 2 ) calls for inspection only " periodically " and only of officially declared installations ; 3 ) would subject all atomic energy control to Russia 's veto in the Security Council . Nor did his story of the leveling of the mountains give any scientific color to the Russians ' accounts of their peacetime use of atomic explosives , which U.S. experts regard as ridiculous . New York Times Science Reporter William Laurence summed up the U.S. view of Vishinsky 's yarn : " Mr , Vishinsky is using the present tense for something that is in the distant future .
