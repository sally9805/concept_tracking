 | The enemy is at work in this country . That is no secret . An invisible army of spies , fifth columnists , and saboteurs is inevitable in wartime . These enemy agents want to know all about movements of troops , ships , raw materials , and finished supplies . They want to know the ports from which men and material are sailing . The expansion rate of both our factories and our armed forces is of prime interest to them . They want to know where each Army and Navy unit is stationed . In brief , they want to pry into every tiny detail of our war effort , in order to attempt to sabotage it by land and by sea . The Federal Bureau of Investigation is charged with the responsibility for our internal security , for protecting the nation against these enemies in our midst . It has the cooperation of the Army Intelligence and of the Navy Intelligence , and of state , local , and county police . But this is not adequate . The F.B.I . has only 3,600 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their hands full with their normal duties before the war began . Therefore you must help ; you , ie average citizen . But you must help intelligently . As Attorney General Francis Biddle says : " We ask every citizen to be vigilant . We earnestly hope he will not be a vigilante . " In other words , you must do your part ; but you must not overdo it ! You must be alert ; you must watch oat diligently ; but you must not attempt to be an amateur detective . Here , then , is what you must do ? and not do ? to aid the G-men to safeguard our war effort : First , report everything you question . If one of your neighbors behaves queerly , tell the F.B.I . On the West Coast a woman observed that the man next door took to spending all his days at home and going out all night . He had no job . He was rude and surly . It looked odd . He turned out to be one of three who were transmitting information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no business there loitering around some important point , tell the F.B.I . A young girl saw a man photographing a reservoir in a big city . Ultimately an enemy agent was identified and imprisoned . If something strange happens to arouse your suspicions , advise the G-men at once . Do n't feel foolish if you turn out to be wrong . The F.B.I would rather have a thousand useless tips than lose one helpful one . Somebody phoned excitedly that a woman 's purse had exploded in a department store . As it happened , she had a gadget for a practical joke in her bag ? but it might have been serious . If some stranger asks you searching and unusual questions about your son or brother in the Army , go to the F.B.I . at once . If you or your husband or son work in a plant with war contracts and some person whose background you do n't know intimately asks about confidential plans , or the lay-@# out of the factory , or the machinery used there , or the processes or output , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work in a war-material factory and you notice one of your fellow employes finding excuses to go into some department in which he has no business , do n't assume he 's looking up a girl friend . The F.B.I . may be interested in him . If you see anyone who happens to pick up waste paper , especially in drafting or photostating rooms where confidential plans or specifications are prepared , do n't just wisecrack about it . He may have a purpose . If you observe that one of your fellow employes is unusually careless , if he damages machinery or materials used or manufactured in your plant by what seems an exceptional number of " accidents , " report him at once . It may be sabotage . If you hear anyone telling that we ca n't win this war , or mouthing the Axis propaganda line , or praising Hitler , do n't see red and walk out . Listen ? and repeat what you heard to the F.B.I . Every large city has a Federal Bureau of Investigation office . You will find the office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too small to have an office , call police headquarters or your local telephone operator . In a half-minute the police official or the operator will give you the address of the nearest F.B.I . headquarters . If you wish to write Washington directly , address your letter : Federal Bureau of Investigation , Department of Justice , Washington , D. C. Do n't confuse information that should be @#  | sent to your local police with matter that is in the realm of the F.B.I . Everything relating to spies , sabotage , or espionage is a Federal affair and in the province of the F.B.I . Such incidents as infringement of civilian-defense regulations ? leaving lights on during a blackout , bootlegging tires ? are purely local violations . Go to the police or civilian-defense officials . When you go to the nearest F.B.I . agent or when you write to Washington , give your name and address . Then , if necessary , one of the G-men can come and talk to you . He may obtain from you details that seemed to you too trivial : report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be of inestimable value in securing evidence . Do NOT take any action yourself . Do n't ask to see a man 's selectiveservice card . Do n't ask your maid to ask someone 's part-time servant to find out what 's in his briefcase . Alluring as the role of detective may be , restrain yourself . You will probably scare him , and you ? and the F.B.I.-may lose him . Do not attempt to evaluate any information yourself . Do n't say : " This looks like espionage ; but surely it 's not important enough to bother about . If we all know the 00th Regiment is in Ireland certainly the Nazis know it , too . I wo n't waste the F.B.I . ' s time telling about thee salesman who asked about Tommy . " That 's bad . The details you may give the G-men about that peddler may into a much larger picture with ramifications . DO N'T become agitated if the F.B.I . apparently does nothing about information you have given them . Foreign agents rarely work independently . Sometimes it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confederates notice by arresting one man . It took the F.B.I . two years to complete the Ludwig case ; but they trapped 32 spies . Do n't suspect or turn a cold should on every man or woman whose name Schmidt or Conti . The persecution minority groups is a great help to Axis , for it helps recruit fifth columnist &; If the foreign-born are wavering in their loyalty , it drives them into the enemy camp . The F.B.I . has seen that happen time after time ; on the other hand , it has never established the premise that aliens are per se more dangerous than Americans or Americans of foreign ancestry . In the first list of officers cited for bravery in this war almost half the names were foreign . Do n't accept rumors or gossip as " in formation . " The air is thick with it . You can do great damage , cause hardship and unhappiness to innocent people . You can waste F.B.I . time by repeating it to the G-man . If you did not see with your own eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is willing to state on oath that he saw , the workman sabotaging bombers in an airplane factory , forget it . Be watchful . Be alert . Be exact . Do n't play sleuth . Do n't evaluate . Do n't repeat . Above all , do n't be hysterical . Remember the F.B.I . asks you to be its eyes and ears , not its right arm . It asks that even citizen follow the order : Be vigilant ; do n't be a vigilante . THE END 1ftens summer-dried skin ? Your hands are they t can help in two ways : t in soapy wafer !
