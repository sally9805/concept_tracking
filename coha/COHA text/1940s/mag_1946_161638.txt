Whatever his chief target may have been , Generalissimo Joseph Stalin 's peace talk , like a swivel-mounted machine gun , raked world affairs from a variety of interesting angles last week . The talk consisted of answers to nine apparently prearranged questions by London Sunday Times Russophile Correspondent Alexander Werth. * <P> Stalin 's three chief points : 1 ) there is no real danger of war ; 2 ) Western capitalism could not encircle Russia , if it tried ; 3 ) Russia and the West can collaborate peacefully under the " Communism in one country " formula . <P> Some of the things Stalin said were pure eyewash-such as his claim that foreign Communist Parties are not controlled by Moscow , and that certain " military-political agents " ( ostensibly in the U.S. ) are stirring up war rumors in order to delay demobilization ( actually , the U.S. is disarming at a far more rapid rate than Russia ) . Some were self-contradictory-such as his swaggering assertion that the atom bomb was merely a weapon to " intimidate weak nerves , " but that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things , such as his assertion that Russia was not planning to use Germany against the West , were made suspect by current Soviet policy and pronouncements . Three days after Stalin 's statement , Pravda called for an " offensive against the ideology of the capitalist world . " <P> Tactical Maneuver . Even most skeptics believed that Stalin really wanted peace , for the time being . But few believed that his assurances marked more than a tactical change in Russia 's expansionist drive . In their opinion , the statement was designed : <P> 1 ) To calm the war-weary Russian people 's own jittery nerves ; <P> 2 ) To give timely aid &; comfort to the miscellaneous followers of Henry A. Wallace and others of their ilk abroad , thus stirring up a popular clamor to make Western Governments appease Russia further ; <P> 3 ) To drive a wedge between the U.S. and Britain by making a honeyed special appeal for smoother Anglo-Russian relations . <P> Said Britain 's Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin : " A little lifting of the clouds . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conference room to actual problems . . . that matters . " Cried Otto Grotewohl , leader of Germany 's Communist-run S.E.D. : " Here speaks a man free of atom-bomb - psychosis . . . . " Said Paris ' L'Epogue : " Stalin must not take us for moujiks . . . . " Said L'Aurore : " Stalin says : ' My hammer works for peace . ' We reply : ' Then stop sharpening your sickle . ' " <P> One fact stood out clearly : the universal sigh of relief that greeted Stalin 's peace coo showed how well the world understood that the only possible threat to peace came from Russia . Most reassuring point : the statement seemed to remove for the time being the greatest source of war danger-the possibility that the Kremlin might underestimate the power and purpose of the U.S. and Britain , and rashly precipitate a situation which would make war inevitable . <P> * Werth was not permitted to file his story until Radio Moscow broadcast it . That put the - whole world press ahead of Werth 's weekly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Times ' ) , which had to wait five full days before printing his " scoop . "
