Into Fort Knox , Ky. , and Fort Benning , Ga. , last week poured a stream of new faces . They were crack officers , detailed in a great batch of Army orders to join the new Armored Force . In officers ' conferences the new force 's commander , Brigadier General Adna Romanza Chaffee , leather-faced son of the late onetime Chief of Staff , Lieut . General Adna R. Chaffee , looked around at a wide assortment of Army insignia . Some , like himself , wore on their collars the crossed sabres of the Cavalry . Present also were the rifles of the Infantry , the cannons of the Artillery , the retorts of the Chemical Warfare Service , the flags of the Signal Corps . <P> So fast had the Army 's newest branch been born that no one had had time to devise an insignia for it . But it was not conceived without planning . Last week , in the midst of organizing two armored divisions and other outfits to make up the First Armored Corps , Adna Chaffee could see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it came in the kind of officers he was getting-the best the service has . More of it came from the sprawling plant of American Car &; Foundry Co. at Berwick , Pa . <P> Fortnight ago to A. C. F. went the Army 's biggest tank order in its peacetime history-627 caterpillared twelve-ton rolling fortresses to cost around $11,500,000 ( about $18,000 apiece ) . Cheering thing to Army men about the order was that they were sure of pretty fast delivery . For under a previous educational order ( for 329 tanks at about $6,000,000 ) A. C. F. 's Berwick plant was already turning out twelve-tonners at the rate of two a day , expected by September to have upped the rate to five a day . <P> Half-starved , like most other great railroad equipment companies , on the trickle of orders from the U. S. 's No. i transportation medium , A. C. F. turned to tanks with gusto . To handle the Army order , plus $12,000,000 in contracts from the Allies for shells , A. C. F. 's Berwick plant boss , spectacled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , started an ordnance department , filled it with annealing hearths , lathes , other machine tools . A. C. F. 's flint-shelled armor plate for tanks is made by a secret process , involving endless steel treating and hardening , and Guy Beishline 's workmen work around the clock , seven days a week . <P> An oldtimer in the tank business , but not on a big production scale , A. C. F. turned out its first twelve-ton machine on May 8-a snub-snouted monster armed with four .30-calibre machine guns , a .50-calibre machine gun for use against aircraft and a wicked-looking 37-rnm. ( about 1-inch ) cannon . Since then the assembly line has turned them out with increasing regularity . A. C. F. drivers take the tanks for 40-m.p.h. trial runs , see that their Continental airplane-type engines function , bring them back to the shop for final adjustment down to close tolerances ( 1/10,000 of an inch ) before marking them ready for delivery . To the officers of the new Armored Corps , anxious to start training their men in new equipment , new Panzer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the doctor ordered .
