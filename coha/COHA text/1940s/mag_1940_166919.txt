The German reader today is the best-informed newspaper reader in the world . . . . The German press , of course , does not publish indiscriminately all the lies and reports cooked up by hostile propaganda . . . . We are not rushing the German newspaper reader from one nerve-racking sensation to another , we are not subjecting him to every stupid political gossip coming from the mouth of some hysterical person or from the pen of our enemies . . . . <P> Before and behind our armament of steel and concrete rises the spiritual armament of our people . It protects us against offensives in the realm of mind . . . . <P> For all the sense these words ( uttered last week by Dr. Otto Dietrich , head of Germany 's press department ) made to a citizen of the U. S. , they might have been the product of another system of communication , like the lowing of cattle or the twittering of birds , not merely another language . <P> In Germany last week there was no such thing as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the German people might be , but what they swallowed was a carefully winnowed , ground , boiled , predigested gruel , designed to nourish but not invigorate their minds . The Nazi press was free from " foreign lies , " free to support the Reich 's worldwide program of expansion-but not free to publish what it pleased . <P> As if to underline Dr. Dietrich 's concept of information , in Mnister last week Dr. Joseph Gebbels , Minister of Public Enlightenment &; Propaganda , told the world what Germany expects of the press in neutral countries . Said he : " Even in neutral States the precepts of freedom of opinion must not be misused ... to insult the warring powers . ... " " It is not enough , " cried Dr. Gebbels , " for the government of a neutral country to proclaim its neutral attitude . . . while public opinion has the freedom to insult ! . . . " Meanwhile , German newspapers bristled with angry editorials attacking the Swiss press , which had referred to Austria , Czecho-Slovakia , Poland as countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reminded Switzerland that it was a small country and would do well to curb any unfriendly opinions in its press .
