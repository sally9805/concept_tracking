REATHS on the doors of old white houses , wine-glass elms curving above quiet streets , snow caught on carved gateposts  --  in winter Litchfield , Connecticut , looks like a village on a Christmas card . It is beautiful in summer , too . But on Christmas Eve , with candles behind the fanlights on North Street , it is a lovely picture of Christmas peace . No railroad and no movies  --  that we knew , but there had been an inn on the Green where travelers could spend the night . Now it was n't there . " No , no inn , " they told us cheerfully at the drugstore after we got of the bus . " But surely this is n't a town without an inn ? " we said , up and down the street . " I 'm afraid so , " replied the well-dressed customer at the grocery . She said it a bit smugly , as she might have said " no movies , " and we began to feel unwant  --  d . It had n't been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after dark , unannounced , the people at the inn had made us welcome . Finally we discovered the comfortable house which took tourists and the restaurant that furnished mea/s . It was at lunch that we got our next shock . The restaurant seemed to be patronized chiefly by townsfolk  --  there was , one gathered , a servant problem in Litchfield . Two Helen Hokinson ladies , natives , glared resentfully at the next table , where people were sitting whom we had n't noticed until we followed the glare . Then it was un- , necessary to hear what the ladies were saying . We were reminded of something we had heard or read ? " They do n't let Jews live in this town . " Could it be true ? Was it true that even Einstein could n't live in Litchfield ? Why , right out there on the Green was a tablet to show where Lyman Beecher 's church had stood , and Harriet Beecher Stowe was born here . Litchfield could n't be a place for race prejudice . It could n't be true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the United States , in New England , in the year of our Lord 1943 . Litchfield , Connecticut , was named for Lichfield in England . The T was put in by accident , but perhaps appropriately . T is for Tory , and many Litchfielders would have gone on drinking tea and paying the king 's tax . Dates on the lovely old houses on North Street-1761 , 1773 ? show that the people who lived there were good substantial citizens before the Revolution . One of the  - -  . - endants , living in the same house , turned down  - -  :Membership In the D. A. R. " My ancestors sided with British , " she told them , " and I think I would have - too . " Of course there is a Revolutionary tradition ? George Washington slept here , and Ethan Allen , some say , was  - -  - born here . But that is disputed ; associations with Aaron Burr and Benedict Arnold are dearer . It is the Civil War tradition that counts . This is the Beechers ' own town . There were Howes here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ founded in 1825 . And out in the hills , not far away , John Brown was born . Idealists , these , but there were fighters as well ; the monument on the Green carries the names of boys who died at Cold Harbor and elsewhere in Virginia , and even down in Texas . You do n't need the flag and the background of elms and white-trimmed red brick to tell you that here is a town in the sound American tradition , a town that should make two Southern visitors raised in the land of Jim Crow feel ashamed of themselves . Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord ; his soul goes marching on . But Governor Lehman could n't live here , or Justice Frankfurter ? Litchfield does n't work for its living , of course ; it does n't have to . There is n't a factory or a labor union in the town . It was not always so ; at the start Litchfield had a lot of industries . In 1810 , according to the Gazeteer of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local industry was iron manufacture , requiring four forges , a slitting mill , and a nail factory . There were also a cotton mill , mills for oil and paper and grain , and no fewer than eighteen sawmills . Besides - the five large tanneries there were " several on a smaller scale " and five saddlers to use the leather . There were two hatters ' shops and two comb factories , two ' carriagemakers , a maker of fine furniture , and " a number of house carpenters , joiners , and smiths and other mechanics . " Not least worthy of mention is the builder who liked pineapple gateposts and Palladian windows . But all this was in the handicraft period , before the mills sprang up on the fall line and the railroads followed trade . After that happened , Litchfield 's only money-making institutions were professional : Miss Pierce 's school for young ladies on North Street , and Judge Tapping Reeve 's law school on South Street . The young ladies married the young lawyers . One or two of the latter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lawyers and bankers lived on North Street , and preachers of course ; and after the old families died out the new people coming In were those who conducted their business elsewhere . As we learned these facts , it was clear to a Southern mind that the pattern of old - towns in Virginia and South Carolina was repeated here in the Connecticut hills . But Litchfield has its great tradition of freedom . it was a station , they say , on the Underground Railroad . It ca n't be true that today Bernard Baruch or Robert Moses could n't buy a lot in Litchfield. - " It is n't true . There is a Jewish lawyer living right in Litchfield and doing business there . " The exception proves the rule . The lawyer , still a young man , has lived his whole professional life in Litchfield ; he came from law school in New York and Boston and went to work in Judge Hubbard 's office . The old judge was an Episcopalian and a good solid citizen . The boy did n't " look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had a name that might have been German . People liked him and still do . Even before the old judge died he was doing most of the work , and so people just went on with him . The firm name is the same , and some new people coming into the office call him Hubbard and make remarks about the Jews right before him , the way they are apt to do in Litchfield . He takes it well ; he belongs to the men 's forum at the Congregational Church , and for a while he owned the Enquirer . Maybe he got a kick out of that . But he does n't put himself forward otherwise . It was years before he bought a house , and then he had more sense than to buy one on North Street . When he sells North Street property now , he knows without being told that he is not to sell it to one of his own race . Lonesome ? Maybe , when people make thoughtless remarks . But he has money , and friends elsewhere , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he likes staying to prove he has a right to stay . Maybe he thinks that in time the prejudice will die out . Others think differently . A world-famous musician and composer , a playwright , a writer on public affairs  --  several people whose names are household words in America ? Jewish by descent or marital connection , have seen the charm of Litchfield and , perhaps wisely , passed it by . Wo n't the war make a change ? There are a hundred stars on the service flag at Litchfield 's Catholic church , seventy-five stars on the Episcopal flag , and forty on the Congregational . The war has made changes in Litchfield life , brought many minor inconveniences . It is a wonder to an outsider where the Helen Hokinson ladies who come shopping on the Green get their gasoline . There is war industry in nearby Bantam , and even a housing problem for workers . The Bantam plant makes aluminum devices for planes and has been doing war work since 1939 . But although Bantam is the older community , its relatively modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put it , unspoiled . Litchfield shows no sign of reaction to world thought , later than , say , the Nurnberg laws . The Enquirer had an isice4er 15 ; 1943 editorial on " Our Town and Its Future " which suggested that the future might " differ , it may be radically in some respects , from conditions we have known at any other period in our past . " Comments from " thoughtful men and women " were invited , and one citizen responded with a column-length letter containing this paragraph : Because of its isolation , the ideas of its founders , and the general type of the residents whom it has attracted through the years , Litchfield has from its foundation contributed more to the cultural values of life than to its material phases . . . . The town has been thought of chiefly as a cultural community . It therefore tends to attract new residents from those who seek cultural surroundings . These in turn spread the flavor of culture and enhance its reputation from that standpoint . Wherever Litchfield is known , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is thus attributed to it . A. The writer continued along this line to the conclusion that any form of material progress that detracted from its cultural distinction would harm the town . Another reader corrected the newspaper 's statement that in 1800 Litchfield had been the fourth-largest town in Connecticut ; it was in 1810 . There seemed to be no unfavorable reaction to the editorial disclosure that in 1940 the population was 600 less than it had been 130 years before . Some kinds of population , of course , Litchfield just does n't want . A good many people whose books are in the town library , whose music could n't be kept off the air , are barred from buying property in Litchfield . Can not a cultural community choose its own kind of culture ? And in truth , are there no cultural values  --  precious , irreparable old things  --  to be lost in the inrush of the vulgar and the foreign ? No movie house on the Green  --  you were glad of that . No trains to smudge the white-painted fanlights . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are left keep themselves to themselves , as wreaths and wax fruit were kept under glass bells in old-fashioned parlors ? Years ago James Truslow Adams wrote an article on what he called the law of diminishing returns applied to places . In his recollection , he said , Montauk Point on Long Island had been a lovely , quiet spot  --  a place of natural beauty . Now it was full of pop bottles . He did n't mind sharing Montauk Point , he said , but the fact was that nobody now had the Montauk Point that had been . Trampled by the herd , it was gone forever . It could n't be shared . It no longer existed . So Litchfield , shared , would cease to exist ? It is one of those deep instinctive arguments hard to combat because they are n't brought into the open . It would be easy to love Litchfield to death . It 's only a little town . - But what about Litchfield 's contribution to cultural values elsewhere ? Other Connecticut towns ? Old Lyme , and Sharon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either . Jews are n't wanted in the New Y suburbs of Bronxville and Jackson Heights . Only a little cancer , but it grows . Surveys show anti-Semitic prejudice throughout the country to be increasing , and to be greatest not in the prejudice-ridden South but in educated New England . When we have to face the issue of post-war immigration , such prejudice must be considered . We could do worse than adopt a proposal made many years ago  --  that we continue to welcome immigration but assign the immigrants to specific regions . Professionally trained refugees could then be directed to parts of the country where doctors or lawyers are needed , farm workers could be absorbed in rural districts , and so on . Litchfield might-be saved by this solution , though it could hardly be expected to show gratitude since the author of the proposal was a Jewish correspondent of the New York Herald named Karl Marx . Meanwhile , why not leave Litchfield in peace , resisting modernization in all its ugly forms ? Like Charleston contra mundum , * let the natives withstand any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of people with different cultures . Only they do n't say , in Litchfield , " We wo n't sell or rent property to Italians or Germans or White Russians or Poles . " They say , " We wo n't sell or rent to Jews . " The town of the Beechers has already changed , where it matters  --  in the head , in the heart . Litchfield churches are important . St. Anthony 's , Roman Catholic , is best attended ; St. Michael 's , Episcopal , has the most expensive altar . There is no synagogue , naturally , although a builder too lazy to construct a pentagon has put two six-pointed stars on the Methodist church . The Congregational church is oldest and most important . The building where Beecher preached is gone now , but the white church on the Green , with the bcntedin pews , is older . Litchfield clergymen , like clergymen everywhere , are approachable . They will even talk about anti-Semitism . " It 's not a new idea in the town , " one minister said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And they think they have a right to do as they please with their own property ? " " Exactly . And with their social life . They do n't Welcome strangers of any sort very readily , I 'm afraid . " The minister seemed honestly not to understand , at first , a Southerner 's questions about the race problem in Harriet Beecher Stowe 's home town . A Litchfield lady who owned a house at Bantam had rented to Negroes , and it had n't been a popular gesture , but otherwise he knew of no race problem . " Then it is n't true that Jews ca n't buy propertyr ? 7'he NeNeo , November 20 , 1942 . ' M , that . Yes , it was true , he believed . Just a sort of general agreement  --  yes , you could call it a Christian - unity among Litchfield people on that point . He smiled at that . No , they did n't realize that it was Hitler 's party line . Just did n't follow it through . And of course there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trains run . As for this Jewish question He was as polite and as distressed as a Mississippi minister asked why Negroes ca n't vote , and quite as helpless to mend matters . He saw no likelihood of change except as the older generation died off . " Certainly not because of the Four Freedoms , " he said with a Republican glint in his eye . But there really was no problem because there were no Jews in the town , except of course the one lawyer who was well thought of . " Just what they say down South  --  there 's no Negro problem except when the Yankees try to make one . Southerners keep them in their place , in the Jim Crow car . " For some reason he did n't quite like that , but he was urbanity itself as he accepted a Southerner 's compliments on Litchfield architecture . " Yes . Yes . And shall we say , next time you come we hope you wo n't find North Street full of Jews ? " It was a time to wonder whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasion to dust off the Beecher sermon preached sixty-six years ago on the occasion of an exhibition of anti-Semitism new and shocking to this country  --  the exclusion of Jewish guests from the Grand Union Hotel at Saratoga Springs . Dr. Beecher reviewed at length civilization 's debt to the Jews in morals , politics , and social justice , and the particular religious debt of all Christians . He noted with approval that " they are becoming land-holders in America . ? . ? They come here to live and stay ; and their children will intermarry with ours ; their blood will flow into the common stream with ours ; and if their virtues might be incorporated with ours it would be of unspeakable advantage to us . " He added a hope : " May they understand that under this government there is no place to which they may not aspire  --  no sphere of finance , no walk in literature , no avenue to honor , no field of art or of science , which is shut to them . The heaven above their head is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways of men in this land . " So spoke Beecher ; and in Litchfield the great Beecher elm still lifts its branches to the heaven he saw arching above North Street . But the clergyman now standing in Beecher 's shoes made it plain , in a pleasant-spoken way , that Beecher 's hope was mistaken . St. Peter and St. Paul could n't live on North Street . Noel , Noel , Born is the King of Israel . Do n't go to Litchfield for Christmas . The Son of David could n't be born there , even in a stable.50
