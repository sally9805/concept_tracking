Two years ago the New York Daily Mirror 's Broadway reporter , Ted Friend , set out to make a big-city newspaperman 's dream come true . Tired of the high pressure life , he bought a country weekly in Susanville , Calif. , and went west envisioning a soft life , a house of many hammocks for lazy lounging ( TIME , Aug. 9 , 1943 ) . This week , a sadder but wiser man , he sold out ; editing a weekly , he had discovered , left little time for lounging . Dragging his hammocks behind him , he is moving on to a ranch near San Francisco , where he says he will write a book to be called Please Fence Me Out .
