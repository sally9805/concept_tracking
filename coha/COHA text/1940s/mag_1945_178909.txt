" Do what we can , " sighed Ralph Waldo Emerson , " summer will have its flies . " In 1945 , summer was having its perennial drought in readable books . " Along about every July , " cracked Random House 's bubbling Bennett Cerf , " publishers start crying into their $6 lunches at the Colony and $2 mint juleps at the Ritz Bar that business is awful . But by September 10 , they 're again screaming that they 're in the 90% income tax bracket . " <P> 1945 's drought was intensified by stringent wartime paper rationing and the absence , on military service , of a generation of would-be writers . Publishers who hoped that things would be better by fall were laying their potential best-sellers on ice , dishing up leftovers and scraps . There were tangible evidences of 1945 's summer doldrums : <P> Publishers ' Weekly announced that there were 81 fewer titles published in the first half of the year than in the same period of 1944 . <P> Reprints of past successes were on the upgrade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so-called " standard authors " ( Henry James , Anthony Trollope , William Makepeace Thackeray were favorites ) . <P> August best-seller lists were packed with tried- &-true; favorites that had been published one , two , even three years ago . Still prominent in popular fiction lists were trusty epics ( 1942 's The Robe ; 1943 's The Fountainhead ) ; cloak- &-dagger; tales set in more glamorous periods of history ( Captain from Castile , Commodore Hornblower ) ; fleshly garlands of love ( " Oh ! " sighed a harassed Manhattan bookdealer , " how tired I am of young girls whispering that they want Forever Amber . " ) <P> In Milwaukee , the sentimental citizenry was buying 10,000 copies a week of a book of photographs ( enlivened with scant text and pen sketches ) called The Story of " Gertie " - all about a duck who hatched six eggs in the heart of the financial district while thousands cheered . <P> Strongest indication of the general drought appeared in the July-August selections of the nation 's largest " book clubs . " The Book-of-the-Month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; $2.75 ) , a translation of a seven-year-old Chinese novel by Lau Shaw about " a humble man 's dream of owning his own rickshaw . " It is a dream , said Clubster Lewis Gannett , filled with the " love of a steady run and a good sweat . " ( As " dividend , " the Club tossed in the eight-months-old novel , The Green Years , by standard best-seller A. J. Cronin . ) <P> Manhattan 's Literary Guild snapped up James Hilton 's So Well Remembered ( Little , Brown ; $2.50 ) - catching it on the fly to Hollywood , where such earlier creations as Lost Horizon have fattened Author-Scripter Hilton 's purse , made his characters familiar to millions . Other famed Hilton pictures : Knight Without Armor ; Goodbye , Mr. Chips ; Random Harvest ( see cut ) . British Author Hilton and Chinese Author Lau Shaw proved brothers under the skin . Both proffered an amiable , spotless husband married to a woman more harpy than human . Each seemed to feel his harpy-heroine typified the evil forces against which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a tonic for America 's jaded summer nerves .
