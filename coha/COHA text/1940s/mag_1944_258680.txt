From London last week came a sympathetic tribute to U.S. Army Air Forces chaplains , written by a U.S. citizen well qualified to report with authority . A Presbyterian preacher 's son who flew in both French and U.S. Armies in World War I , Gill Robb Wilson entered the ministry himself , gave it up because of a throat affliction resulting from war injuries , has since been New Jersey State Director of Aviation , president of the National Aeronautic Association . He is now in England as aviation editor of the New York Herald Tribune . After interviewing members of the Eighth Air Force , he reported : <P> " A good chaplain , they claimed , is worth his weight in gold , and a poor one is worse than none at all . <P> " Sermonizing was judged to be comparatively useless . No orator on earth can impress a group of men on tension . But a quick prayer with the crews before they climbed aboard for a mission to Berlin was better than a shot of brandy . The boys feel that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since briefing is often quite a soul-searching business . . . . <P> " Knowing the chaplain will be there waiting if they come back wounded is a real comfort . Knowing he is back there praying while they are sweating through a mission is a first-class bracer . . . . <P> " A chaplain who is not naturally at home with the men or who must stand on his sanctity is under a great handicap . . . . One outfit told me of teaching their chaplain to shoot craps and of how one night he had a phenomenal streak of luck . . . . Practically all the loose change in the squadron was on the Lord 's side . With great glee they described the chaplain 's embarrassment and his frantic attempts to get the filthy lucre back in their hands by reckless play . None of it worked . The game broke up with the padre rolling in clover and blushes , and the boys would n't take 1,000 shillings each for the fun they had that night . They never let on about extra cigarets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfort . It would spoil the chaplain 's fun if he knew they knew he was distributing his winnings for the peace of his soul . And they love the guy too much for that . <P> " A second outfit bragged to me that their chaplain was the best egg and the poorest poker player on earth . ' We ca n't teach him not to draw to a bobtailed flush or try to fill in the middle . ' This appeared incomprehensible since the guy was apparently so smart when it came to anyone 's troubles but his own . <P> " No one could tell me what effect the war in the air was having on the spiritual life of the men . All were certain that the average member of a fighting crew took constant refuge in prayer . No one had ever heard an airman scoff at religion . What the boys would do about going to church after the war depended upon what the church would do about taking an aggressive part in a realistic world order . Keep churches open 24 hours a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can go in any old time and brief himself for a tough spot ' was the suggestion of one lad . There 's a suggestion for the preachers . Stop preaching and start briefing . "
