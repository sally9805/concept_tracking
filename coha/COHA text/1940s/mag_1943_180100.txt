Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die , it abideth alone ; but if it die , it bringeth forth much fruit . John 12:24 . <P> When Perry Hayden , Quaker and Tecumseh , Mich. , miller , heard a sermon on this text ( that life evolves out of death ) , he wanted to prove it literally . So he planted 360 kernels of high-yielding Bald Rock wheat . Then Quaker Hayden had another idea : he would dramatize the Biblical injunction of tithing ( giving a tenth of one 's income to God ) , so he pledged a tenth of his harvest to his meeting . <P> Fortnight ago , when Hayden reaped his third harvest ( 26 bushels ) , he had notable visitors : Henry Ford and Charles Figy , Michigan 's Commissioner of Agriculture . Ford , who owns the acre of land used for the project , brought along a - year- old self-raking reaper for use in the harvesting . Figy came to inspect the wheat which in its first harvesting had multiplied 50-fold , almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grains grow that Hayden calls them " dynamic kernels . " Next year , Hayden expects to harvest from 15 to 20 acres .
