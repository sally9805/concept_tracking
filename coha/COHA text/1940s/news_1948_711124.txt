txt WASHINGTON , Marcli 18 ? The Government acted swiftly today to ease the mounting coal crisis by ordering a 25 per cent cut in coal burning passenger service and a ban on coal exports . Both orders become effective Sunday as a result of the stoppage of nearly 400,000 members of the United Mine Workers of America . The dispute which caused the " spontaneous " shutdown is over the inability of John L. Lewis , miners ' trustee on the welfare fund to agree with Ezra Van Horn , operators trustee , on the amount of the pension which shall be paid miners on retirement and on the eligibility of the pension applicants . Mr. Lewis charged last Friday that the operators had " dishonored " their contract and on Monday the miners began to leave the pits . In the meantime White House conferences today were concerned with the problem of returning the miners to their tasks . Cyrus S. Ching , director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service , conferred with Dr. John R. Steelman , the assistant to the President . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem facing the Government is whether or not to have the President name a board of inquiry under the Taft-Hartley Act , to be followed by a request on the Attorney-General to enjoin the strikers from remaining idle . The dispute is quite unprecedented since it is between two trustees of the welfare fund into which the operators pay 10 cents a ton . It is not directly a fight between operators and miners . After a meeting held today by a representative group of operators with Mr. Van Horn it was reported that papers were ready for a peti // tion to the Federal District Court requesting the naming of a third trustee who might break the Lewis-Van Horn deadlock . Third- Trustee Sought Mr. Van Horn gave the miners ' chief until tomorrow to join with him in asking the court to name a third trustee . Mr. Lewis has taken no action as yet and if he refuses to budge tomorrow the operators ' trustee has said that he would . act unilaterally in calling on the court to name a trustee for the fund , which amounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today by the Office of Defense Transportation bans the roads from substituting other than coal burning locomotives for the curtailed operations .. According to the Assocaition of American Railroads the order means an 11 per cent reduction in total passenger mileage . About one quarter of passenger mileage is hauled by coal burning locomotives . At the AAR offices it ' was said that most of the so-called " name " trains are now Diesel driven and would not be affected by the ODT order . The railroads consume 300,000 tons of coal daily in freight and passenger service . Of this the passenger service takes . 49,000 tons and a 25 per cent reduction would mean a saving of a little more than 12,000 tons daily . Other sourcs of curtailment may soon include elimination of second sections of passenger trains normally running in two sections ; general reduction in train lengths , and elimination of use of double headed locomotives . Both Mr. Lewis and Mr. Van Horn today furnished the Joint Congressional Labor Relations Committee with data on the dispute . The committee will meet next week to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Savings Most of the railroads serving the New York metropolitan area began surveys yesterday to determine how the order of the Office of Defense Transportation , ordering a 25 per cent cut in mileage of coalburning passenger trains , would be applied . The results of the survey , which will show the cancellations or the changes in train schedules that are necessary , will be announced today . The New York Central Railroad said the principal through trains , which are hauled by Diesel-electric locomotives , would not be affected and commuter service would be affected little if at all . The West Shore division out of Weehawken , the Putnam division out of the Bronx and local trains north of Harmon and White Plains use coal , but it was believed the saving could be made without disrupting their schedules . The New York Central later announced that it would discontinue 169 trains beginning Monday ? to comply with the order . This would t*'duce- passenger mileage on steam-operated trains by 22.940 - miles . Up-State Trains Cut The discontinued Central trains include six out of Grand Central Station on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York and North Adams , Mass. , on the Harlem division . The only commuter trains affected were among twenty trains discontinued on the West Shore Railroad . The New York , New Haven &; Hartford Railroad said only 30 per cent of its passenger mileage is steam-operated , so that it would only be obliged to cut its total mileage 7.5 per cent . The Pennsylvania Railroad said few if any , of its present trains would be canceled in New Jersey . The Erie Railroad uses all coalburning locomotives . It forecast a 24 per cent cut in service , retaining rush hour trains , however . The Delaware , Lackawanna and Western Railroad said some steam commuter trains may be curtailed , but most through trains are electrified in the New Jersey area . The Central Railroad of New Jersey has 240 steam-operated and twenty Diesel-operated trains daily . It said trains probably would be canceled on lines where commuters are served by buses . The Baltimore &; Ohio Railroad said its New York division would not be affected and elsewhere its trains were mostly Diesel-operated .
