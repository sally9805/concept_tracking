SLOCUMERNST KARL WINTERLEON ORLOWSKISAMUEL ... pg . 20 Letters to The Times TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TEKES : Several American friends of long standing , with whom I became acquainted while vice consul in New York and then secretary of the Polish Legation in Washington , expressed their disappointment because of the attitude of the Polish representative in the Security Council of the UNO . They asked : " Why is your representative going with Russia against us ? " I must admit I was flabbergasted . It seems to me that through the " realistic approach " to the international affairs advocated by the press and the radio , confusion apparently prevails in the minds of many people . Try to find one ! Instead , you can readily buy a " fancy " rayon sport shirt at $9.90 . The manufacturer is not interested  --  meaning it is unprofitable ? in producing a cotton shirt to sell at the $2.25 ceiling , so he transfers his efforts to some more profitable item . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shirt at a profit in tremendous quantities because of the demand for it . True , the old $2.25 shirt might cost the consumer $2.75 or even $3 , but most of us would gladly pay it rather than buy what we now have to at considerably higher prices . The point is that , without price controls , the " official " index of shirt prices might be higher , but the average price which people pay for shirts would probably be less than at present and people would be much better satisfied with what they get . W. M. CURTISS , Associate Professor of Marketing , Cornell University . Ithaca , N. Y. , March 27 , 1946 . Free Market Seen as Relief Removal of Price Controls Viewed as Black Marketers ' Doom To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : In his column of March 25 , " Free , Market vs . Black Market , " Henry Hazlitt listed three reasons why , if price controls were removed , free market prices would not rise to a point as high as present black-market prices . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to explain further why black-market prices are not dependable guides as to where prices would go without controls . Mr. Hazlitt mentioned the additional cost due to the legal risks which black marketers take . Another cost is the ' direct expense incurred in evading legal prices . Price controls have broken down many of the regular established channels of trade , such as grain markets , and in order to do business , processors and distributors have been forced to substitute new inefficient methods for the old efficient ones . It is reported that when a feed manufacturer hears a rumor that a little grain is available somewhere he immediately sends out a man to try and buy it . The waste of time in travel , hauling and back-hauling are all costs that get into the black-market price . Compare these inefficient , clumsy methods with the exchange of goods through regular markets , often by telephone . Such inefficiencies would disappear if price controls were removed ; the total human effort required to distribute a unit of goods would be reduced . Price controls have forced manufacservices to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the manner to cause a maximum effect with minimum costs . Austria has reconstructed its political set-up , after more than a decade of continued catastrophes , in a most admirable way . Today she is a. model of cooperation . No other country has been stricken as heavily by partition into four zones , where four Allied armies rule . Vienna 's plight surpasses that of all other large cities of Europe . Why does American generosity not tear down all the petty obstacles against the sure method of helping the Viennese people during the next 120 days ? ERNST KARL WINTER , Former Deputy Mayor of Vienna . Tenafly , N. J. , March 25 , 1946 . Polish Position Outlined Former Legation Officer Holds Present Government Not Representative Civilian Mall Also Delayed TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I was interested to read Eleanor R. Peterson 's letter in THE NEW YORK TIMES criticizing the delays to mails to and from troops overseas . I feel that many readers would also be interested to know why civilian mails between Britain and America suffer similar interminable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which has taken a month to reach this country , while an exactly similar time has been involved with letters traveling in the opposite direction . A number of letters arrived on March 5 with London postmarks dated between Feb. 5 and Feb. 19 . This indicates that the British Postoffice ? ccumulated letters over a period of a fortnight , and this at a time when the liners Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth were making regular runs . Is one to assume that these 5-day boats are not carrying mails ? If not , why not ? Surely if trade is to revive between the two countries , then the principal prerequisite is an efficient mail service between them . CHARLES BREWER . New York , March 27 , 1946 . Mercy Gardens for Peace To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : What victory gardens did for winning the war , mercy gardens can do for winning the peace . The peace has not been won . And if it is not won , we face the terrible prospect of a third World War , far more destructive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the way of winning the peace than the starvation that threatens tens of millions in Europe and Asia . It will leave a bitterness in its wake that future Hitters will exploit . Indifference to the pleas of UNRRA , Red Cross and other agencies of mercy is indifference to peace . FRANK D. SLOCUM . New York , March 28 , 1946. overwhelming majority of Communists . In order to hide the true situation , two former members of the London Government were included , which subterfuge permitted the British to represent this Government as a democratic one . In fact , it is a communistic Government and as such takes orders from Moscow . It does not represent the Polish nation . Impartial observers agree that if free elections were possible in Poland ? they are not and will not be as long as the present Government remains ? the Communists would not poll more than 4 to 7 per cent of the total vote . Under the present conditions the attitude of Dr. Lange in the Security Council can not be expected to be any different from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not be made responsible for the behavior of Dr. Lange . In its editorial " A Crucial Decision , " THE TIMES refers to Poland thus : " for only the Polish satellite supported Russia 's stand . " This is perfectly true , but I ask my American friends , Who is responsible for this situation ? LEON ORLOWS/k.I . New York , March 28 , 1946 . Czechoslovak Industries To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORE : TIMES : I read with genuine interest the dispatch from Prague printed in the March 24 issue of your paper , in which your correspondent John MacCormac describes the nationalization of industries in Czechoslovakia . I consider the dispatch a fortunate departure from the habit of some observers who concentrate on trifling issues and overlook the basic changes taking place in what has come to be known as the " Soviet orbit . " I was somewhat puzzled by the statement in Mr. MacCormac 's story that the workers and managers of the nationalized enterprises " became in effect civil servants . " The nationalization decree of Oct. 24 , 1945 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1946 , states in Part III , Paragraph 25 , that the working conditions and wages of employes in nationalized enterprises are governed by " regulations valid in private enterprise . " This is quite in agreement with the spirit of . the Czechoslovak nationalization law which aims at the creation of economically sound units based on the principles of business accounting . SAMUEL L. SHARP , Research Associate , Foundation for Foreign Affairs . Washington , March 25 , 1946. 7 ? Food for Austria Urged To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : In your issue of March 21 E. M. Fleischman rightly suggests that private shipment of food to famine stricken Europe ought to be encouraged and not hampered by red tape . We are officially told that the next 120 days will be the most critical period for Europe . Would it not be a good idea to intensify just for - this crucial period the shipment of parcels from individuals to individuals ? - Would not even a special drive mobilizing all the private energies be- advisable ? In this connection the completely nonunderstandable factor must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which no private parcels can be sent is Austria .
