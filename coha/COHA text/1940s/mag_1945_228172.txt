Many an American thinks of a church as a plain , white clapboard rectangle with a steeple and stained-glass windows . He might have difficulty recognizing some of the 3,616 churches now on postwar planning boards . Among the more outlandish designs , most of them reported in this month 's Architectural Record : A community church in Carmichael , Calif. , which will include a badminton court , tennis court and swimming pool , for the strengthening and immersing of the congregation . <P> A super-modernistic Presbyterian Chapel in Pennsylvania 's Pocono Mountains at Delaware Water Gap , to be equipped with movable seats and altars , whose arrangement will depend " upon the time of day , the position of the sun and the purpose of the meeting . " The tower will contain a water tank ( see cut ) . <P> A Thermal , Calif , chapel , " conceived as an oasis in a desert community , " will be built around an open court , which wall be full of green vegetation , and floodlighted at night . The congregation will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window at the head of the chancel . A cube-shaped " tower " will house machinery to keep parishioners cool . <P> A Lutheran Church planned for a Midwestern town will be adorned with boxlike windows and a " reflection pool " reminiscent of prewar world 's fairs ( see cut ) . <P> A proposed Catholic Church ( not yet sold to any parish ) would be semicircular , with tiered seats like an amphitheater . Its tower would be two high walls intersecting at right angles to recall " the mission to go forth and preach the Gospel to the four corners of the earth . " <P> But most new churches will look just like the old ones . Says Walter A. Taylor , consultant to the Interdenominational Bureau of Architecture : " History and logic to the contrary , the now familiar forms of the Victorian and neo-Gothic have become a tradition-the phrases of architectural language which say ' church . ' "
