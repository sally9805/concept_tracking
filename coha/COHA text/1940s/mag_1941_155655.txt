INSIDE LATIN AMERICA-John Gunfher - Harper ( $3.50 ) . <P> There are plenty of good books on Latin America* in the bookstores , but this is the one that everybody is going to read . Last week its advance sales ( including Book-of-the-Month Club orders ) reached 225,000 copies . <P> There are two good reasons why : 1 ) John Gunther has enormous prestige as a news coverer of continents ( Inside Europe ; Inside Asia ) ; 2 ) his amassing of colorful detail is as easy to take as gossip . <P> The worst and best that can be said of Inside Latin America is that it is typical Gunther-broadsides of factual beef boiled down to the shreds assimilable by the man in the street . The continental scale is impressive ; the book is an amazing condensation job , and so plausible that tens of thousands of readers will be sure they have been to Latin America . <P> How accurate is the reporting ? It is probably full of slips and glib judgments . <P> They are inseparable from books like this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuss &; fret about them . The total picture is accurate enough-allowing for the fact that Gunther was in Latin America last winter and the tempo of changes in the Western Hemisphere is now geared to the tempo of changes in Europe . But for tabloid readability John Gunther ca n't be beat . <P> Mexico . John Gunther tore down the west coast of South America , then looped back north through Brazil and the West Indies . He began with Mexico , where he " flew over pyramids bigger than those in Egypt ... ate limes stuffed with coconut . . . found that Mexico is the country where the letter ' x ' is pronounced three different ways ... and where during one civic riot the taxicabs charged mounted cavalry like tanks-and won . " He also talked to President Manuel Avila Camacho , who is " about as colorful as a slab of halibut , " but " steady , cautious and efficient . " In Mexico Gunther shed some common U.S. illusions : 1 ) that Mexican Presidential terms usually end with assassination ( there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that all Mexican Governments are overthrown by violence ( none has been overthrown since 1920 ) . <P> He learned a lot about Mexican labor , land , Church , oil and political problems , and about the German colony , " probably the most effective Fifth Column agency in all Latin America . " Central America . " One of the most remarkable characters in the Americas " is 63-year-old General Jorge Ubico , Guatemala 's " constitutional President " who is " an utterly complete dictator . " He keeps Guatemala " as orderly as an empty bil liard table , " himself patrols the whole country on a motorcycle . When he finds a lazy official relaxing in an automobile , he takes the car away from him , gives him a motorcycle . " Try this for a year , " he says , " and see how it shakes your kidneys up . " Germans in Guatemala completely dominate the coffee industry in two provinces , in another own the railroad which is the only outlet to the sea . But Dictator Ubico would like nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German . . . into a concentration camp . " Then he could confiscate all their properties .
