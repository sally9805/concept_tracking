" Only a year ago , there were many loyal Americans-and I was one of them - who felt that this was not our war . We used to say that if the Soviets were wiped off the map it would be good riddance , and that the feeble , guilty old British Empire was not worth one American life . . . . Humiliating as it is , I am ready to confess that we were wrong and President Roosevelt was right . It was our war from the first . " <P> With these vigorous words the president of America 's biggest Roman Catholic university last week admitted publicly that he had been wrong-something that President Roosevelt himself has never done except about Thanksgiving . The author of this graceful admission is that urbanely dogmatic Jesuit , the very square-jawed Very Rev. Robert Ignatius Gannon S.J. , who made it to his own students at the formal opening of Fordham 's joist academic year . <P> Father Gannon is an educator who never lacks positive convictions . Among his pet bugaboos are : <P> &gt; Letting students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late great Charles W. Eliot ( " that Pied Piper of Harvard who 50 years ago had all the mice and men of American universities trailing behind him as he played the tune of electivism " ) . <P> &gt; Academic freedom , a " mumbo jumbo " that allows any educator " the privilege of uprooting all the true foundations of life . " ( Fordham follows Father Gannon 's precept : " Students should be taught obedience to the constituted authority simply because it is the constituted authority . . . We do not expect to argue with a Fordham freshman . We expect them to do as they are told . " ) <P> &gt; Progressive education ( " a piece of rubber hose is at times worth ten years of the new psychology " ) . <P> Father Gannon is noteworthy among Catholic college presidents for his outspokenness ( most of his colleagues let the hierarchy do the talking ) , for publishing Fordham 's annual accounts ( unwritten Catholic law is to avoid public financial statements whenever possible ) , and for the fact that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period . Few presidents of Catholic colleges serve more than a set term , which in the 68 Jesuit-run schools ( including Fordham ) is six years . Father Gannon 's term would normally have been up last June , but his superiors got round its regulation by appointing another Jesuit as rector of Fordham , continuing Father Gannon as president . <P> Last week , having recanted isolationism , he made clear what he now believes in . He wants the U.S. to plan for a perpetual draft after the war and to ignore " the usual long-haired men and short-haired women who will want at once to tear down our national defenses . " He " will be surprised and very much dismayed if the U.S. ever disarms again . " One benefit he foresees from compulsory peacetime military service is a permanent three-year college course to enable undergraduates to spend the fourth year in uniform : " Our young men will profit from a year 's military training and will be saved a year of the wasted time that has always characterized American education .
