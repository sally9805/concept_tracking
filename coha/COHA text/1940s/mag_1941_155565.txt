After two months of confusion on the subject of Army and Navy censorship of military news , last week outlines of order emerged from chaos . Not only did the Navy reorganize its press bureau , but the Army enunciated a sensible policy on military news-a policy that stopped far short of real censorship . <P> Although the Navy Department is headed by a newsman , Secretary Frank Knox , not until last week did it follow the lead of the Army in heading its press section with a ranking officer - able to make decisions on what is printable without consulting a host of superiors - and giving him experienced newsmen as aides . <P> For its new press head the Navy chose Rear Admiral Arthur Japy ( rhymes with happy ) Hepburn , onetime Commander in Chief of the U.S. Fleet ( June 1936 to January 1938 ) . A saltwater sailor who has had more sea service than any other officer in the service , Admiral Hepburn knows what it is to meet the press , from his experience as delegate to London and Geneva @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new aide wangled last week for Admiral Hepburn : Hal O'Flaherty , able , genial managing editor of Frank Knox 's Chicago Daily News . <P> O'Flaherty , now 50 ( and a new lieutenant commander in the Naval Reserve ) , has had a brawling , successful career as leg man , foreign correspondent in World War I , crack editorial executive . <P> Meanwhile the Army 's publicity machine - recently reorganized and topped by Major General Robert Charlton Richardson Jr . of the Cavalry - in place of its former small Washington staff now has 29 officers . Some are reserves , some are regulars , like Lieut . Colonel Stanley Grogan , who used to be a newspaperman . It also has more than 100 in the field . Last week newsmen learned that General Richardson will be responsible to John J. Mc-Cloy , bald , bulky Manhattan lawyer and new Assistant Secretary of War ( see p. 27 ) . <P> On top of this , Under Secretary of War Robert P. Patterson announced the Army 's ruling about military news : henceforth Army officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or presence of U.S. troops in stations outside the Continental limits of the U.S. <P> This ruling was notably moderate . It merely laid down subjects on which the <P> Army itself would not speak and did not impose any censorship of the press itself . <P> Under Secretary Patterson made it clear that he was opposed by conviction to press censorship .
