txt By Telephone to THE NEW YORE TM/ES . BERNE , Switzerland , Dec. ** " white terror " is to be intensified in France with arrests , internment and control of every citizen , it was evident today . Pierre Laval , Chief of Government . in one sentence of a Vichy press declaration , asserted he would " crush ruthlessly everything in* my path that may prevent me from saving France , " in his collaboration with Germany . He implied the possibility of an eventual break with Marshal Henri Philippe Petain . Laval revealed the manner in which he intends to use the almost dictatorial powers conceded him by the Marshal . As a further proof of his intentions , the Vichy Havas agency now Nazi-controlled told of many arrests of " Communists , terrorists and anti-nationals " by " the special police section for political affairs . " Laval 's pronouncement gained importance from the circumstances of the utterance . It was made in Vichy last evening at a conference , but details were not released until today . The audience was the controlled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marshal Petain 's reply to Adolf Hitler 's two letters .

Laval 's commentary on it was forthright . " Germany 's victory will prevent our civilization from foundering in the communistic chaos , " said Laval . " An American victory would bring in its train the triumph of Jews and Communists . " Laval acknowledged that public opinion in France was " not unanimous " in sharing his views . His threat indicated that he intends to try to make the French people toe the line ; and he holds all the trumps , the chief of which is an efficient police force  --  inherited from Admiral Jean Francois Darlan 's regime in Vichy . That force may be relied upon to proceed with the " courage " that the German press urges should replace previous appeals by Vichy for collaboration with the Axis . Meanwhile Laval is reported to be leaving tomorrow " for parts unknown . " The text of Marshal Paain 's reply to Hitler , which was written Dec. 5 , was published in the German press today .
