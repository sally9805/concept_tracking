but she did it brazenly . Then she was kicked into the history department and sent to Siberia to teach civics . She does n't give a damn for anyone and does just as she pleases . Tissler does his best to humiliate her but she just looks over his head as if he did n't exist . It eats into his liver . " " I 'd Iike to know what she does with her money , " another girl said . " She never gives fifty cents to the welfare fund , although I put a note in her box every term . Maybe she spends it on lawyers . She must be a nut about lawsuits . You can see by the time book how often she 's absent to go to court . " A girl who had collapsed on the couch raised her head . " Somebody once told me that she had lived for years with a domineering mother who had a heart attack every time she was thwarted . The old lady became so peculiar that no one was ever invited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are so many teachers who make a career out of being devoted daughters to aged hellcats . " As a newcomer I established myself in the group by describing the scene on the trolley car . I was pretty good at imitations , and as my effort was received with so much appreciation I was tempted to dress it up a bit  --  especially the conversation with Mr. Kelly . A few days later I gave a repeat performance by request of a few who had missed the first one . AL every morning I caught the TI same car , and since it was awkward not to notice Miss Mulford , I fell into the habit of walking to school at her side . Although she seldom spoke to me , the silence was not uncomfortable . After a while I even felt that she liked to have me there . Since her classroom was behind mine , I soon learned more about her queer ways . We were both supposed to be following the same syllabus for the creation of good citizens . It began with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was laboring to get explanations of aeration , coagulation , and the Ashokan reservoir , I could hear Miss Mulford giving an enthusiastic description of Roman aqueducts . As the weeks went , by I dutifully followed through with the prescribed topics , but Miss Mulford skipped entirely Garbage Disposal , Sewage , and Our Parks . I heard her talking about mythology , Greek temples , and Saracen art at Monreale and why so many Italians had to leave the mother country . Her kids were always quiet even though according to the latest theories she was a pedagogical sinner . When we were caught giving the pupils information we were chided for " dominating " the lesson . No supervisor ever went near Miss Mulford . She had long since been given up as hopelessly incapable of improvement . Once in a while the other teachers asked me how my girl friend was getting along with Mr. Kelly . For some reason my imitation of her did n't seem funny to me any more . I stopped talking about her entirely . Maybe it was because we shared a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of myself . One morning I was called into the office to bear witness before the father of one of my truants . Tony had quit school informally in the middle of learning about garbage disposal , although he should have been strongly motivated because his father worked on a sanitation truck . His only response to my attempt to use his " life situation " had been , " When ya woik on de garbitch ya get good money an ' de boss he ca n't fire ya but when ya get home ya clothes , dey stink . " When I entered the office Mr. Tissler was red in the face and yelling at Mr. Gallucci as if by sheer noise he could beat comprehension into the brain of the stocky , weather-beaten man in a green suit who was calmly repeating , " Me no spika Eenglish . Me no unnerstan ' . " The head of the annex was a little narrow-shouldered man who wore a heavily padded natty gray suit . His nails were perfectly manicured , his trousers sharply pleated , but the effect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form rows of fine creases fanning out from the crotch . It was disgusting that I always had to notice this . By the expression on Mr. Gallucci 's face it was clear that he regarded the raving little man as one of nature 's idiots who had to be humored patiently . Miss Mulford came into the room to speak to the clerk just as Mr. Tissler threw his hands to the sides of his face and cried despairingly , " Why is n't there somebody in this school who can talk Italian ? " Over his bowed head Miss Mulford turned and winked at Mr. Gallucci and me . The three of us grinned in a bond of understanding . Patsy Delgreco was the cause of my shame . One period he sat in the back of the room , so intent on drawing a picture that he did not hear me call his name . When I ordered him to bring it to me he was overcome by an agony of embarrassment . Realizing the probable nature of his work , I decided that common knowledge of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I carefully tore it up and threw it in the basket . However , I had deceived Patsy by slipping his drawing under the blotter and tearing up a similar piece of yellow school paper . At lunch time I got the shock of my life . It was a recognizable drawing of myself , rather skillfully done . The lines of my clothes were descriptive , only it was an X-ray dress . Beneath it the anatomical features were detailed . Of course I knew that such art work is not uncommon among adolescents , but I was furious that he had dared to use me for the subject . The next day I lit into him unmercifully for some trivial offense . I was sorry afterwards , and very much ashamed the next morning when I realized that Miss Mulford had heard me . As we walked to school she made one of her rare remarks , with no introduction or amplification . " There is no doubt that the most gifted person in the school is Patsy Delgreco . " That was the last time that we walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flu . On my first day back Mr. Kelly motioned me to sit near him . " Have you heard aught of Miss Mulford ? " he asked . " No . Is she sick too ? " " She 's not come for several days .. I thought you might have heard . " I promised to inquire and let him know . At the next red light he turned to me again . " She 's a fine woman and a classical scholar . Now my head 's too old for learning , but I was always one who liked to read a bit beyond the papers . One day a kid left a book in the car  --  the Odyssey it was , and I kept it to give to Miss Mulford . That night , having nothing better to do , I started reading it and since then I 've been turning over and over in my mind that man on the raft in the wine-dark sea . / told her about it and she 's been lending me other classical books . I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Before we got to the end of the trip I had worked out the meaning of the conversation which I had made such a joke of on the day I had arrived at the school . At first I was impelled to confess to the others how wrong it had been . Then I decided to Iet it go . They might think it was even funnier that Miss Mulford should be reduced to discussing 1phigenia in Tauris with an old motorman . I was unable to bring Mr. Kelly any news . No one knew or cared much about her . A otrr a month later , the welfare fund having been exhausted by a grippy winter , a collection was being taken up for someone who had been sick long enough to rate a book . " Why do n't we send some flowers to Miss Mulford ? " I asked on an impulse . " We never do , " the collector answered in surprise . " She never contributes . Last winter she was out for a long time and we did n't . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then one of the girls took out a quarter . " Oh , Iet 's send her some for the hell of it . The poor old crackpot will have quite a shock . " Everybody chipped in willingly enough , and I was delegated to find out from the payroll clerk in the main building where she was . " That 's life , " the weary math teacher sighed . " You could die and the only person who would know or care would be the clerk who handles the pay checks . " I received the address of a hospital when I phoned . On Friday afternoons I was always in a hurry to get down to Columbia for my philosophy course , so I postponed ordering the flowers . Spring came early that April . On Saturday morning I started out feeling happy because of the weather , because I had a new suit and shoes , and besides I was young and healthy instead of being old and sick in a hospital . I was moved to make a payment for my well-being by performing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of my own dollars to buy the largest dark red roses , and decided to take them to the hospital myself . I 've always hated hospitals . The sight of long corridors of half-closed doors and the smell of emphasized sterility deflated my spirits immediately . I hesitated before the door to which I had been directed , suddenly feeling that I and the lush roses were an impertinent intrusion on a stranger 's privacy . In spite of an irrational desire to run away I entered the silent room . Miss Mulford was sitting half propped up in bed . She looked at me without surprise or question . Her slow smile accepted me and made unnecessary the exchange of foolish remarks you usually find yourself making in a sickroom . I put the roses on the table beside the bed . Curiously , she did not exclaim about them . She merely felt the velvety texture of a petal between her thin fingers . The lines and planes of her face were distorted by a wasting of flesh from the bony structure , and her hair looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She looked toward a chair that stood in a broad band of sunlight near the window . " Will you sit there where I can see you better ? " she asked . " It is good of you to bring your youth and life into this room . " Like an obedient child I sat on the straight chair in the sunshine . We were quiet in a strange sort of peace . Sometimes when she closed her eyes and drew her mouth in a tight line , the knowledge of her pain came to me in a tension of my own muscles . When she smiled again I knew that she was glad to see me there . A nurse came in with a little tray . She was smooth perfection in a stiff white dress , painted mask of a face , and metallic waved yellow hair . She took Miss Mulford 's arm as if it were her sole object of interest and deftly plunged a hypodermic needle in the flabby flesh . Although I wanted to follow the nurse out , my body did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how to break away . I sat like a prisoner of unmeasured time . Miss Mulford began to speak in an unaccented monotone , as if the words were coming unbidden to her tongue . " So little sleep now . . . then pain . When there is no more sleep the pain will devour me and then it will end . . . swallowed up in the pain of dying . Eating into my breasts . . . my foul breasts cut off but it is eating into my bones . An ugly , a final ghastly joke . An old maid 's virgin , useless breasts . To bear the seeds of life that die in unfulfillment . . . the secret tragedy that makes the universal joke . " The unchanged expression of Miss Mulford 's eyes told me that she had no suspicion that the drug had broken down the barrier between her mind and lips . The revelation of naked thought made me feel cold with shock . My mind was like the blank walls of the hospital room , yet I knew that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would change my whole life . The nurse came to the door and beckoned . Outside , she said in a hard professional voice , " Are you a friend of hers ? " " No  --  not exactly . We used to teach in the same school . " Suddenly the smooth mask broke and the nurse 's blue eyes filled with tears . I was surprised to realize that she was a girl of my own age . " Is n't there anyone who gives a damn that she 's dying ? God , if she 'd only yell and carry on a bit , but she just lies there patiently waiting and you 're the only person who 's been to see her . " The nurse turned her back on me abruptly and marched off with stiffly squared shoulders . I ran down the stairs to escape into the warm sunshine of my own world . Everything looked unreally clear and sharp in the strong light . I stood still for a minute , acutely aware of the lines of gray buildings against the blue sky , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tender green of city trees . Then I hurried to the corner store and telephoned John to tell him that I wanted to marry him as soon as possible and to the devil with my Ph.D . If I could have brought myself to explain what had been to me the profound experience of knowing what hitherto I had only known about , my memory of Miss Mulford might not have remained a hurt . Caught up in the happy excitement of getting married , I resented the intrusion of a pity that was tinged with guilt and shame which I wanted to bury and forget . During the few days that / returned to school , a gnawing sense of guilt disturbed me because I did not tell the other teachers what would have amended my callous mockery of a woman on my day of arrival at the annex , and I kept putting off the decent gesture of another visit to the hospital . The day before my wedding I forced myself to face it . I was ashamed to realize that when I discovered I was too late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EN years is long enough to forgive yourself for being young , and for emotions to become memories of emotions . I was sitting on a bench on Morning-side Drive , running my eyes off the ends of the lines as I read , to watch my youngest boy on his tricycle , when I saw a tall , attractive-looking young soldier standing at the curb , looking at me with hesitant recognition . As I looked up he came over , smiling . " You 're Miss Howell , are n't you ? " he said . " Yes , " I answered , surprised to be taken so far back . " I do n't suppose you remember me . I 'm Pat Delgreco . They used to call me Patsy when I was in your civics class at the old annex . " I fished back into my memory for a grimy , skinny little boy with thick hair falling over bright black eyes . Because of the X-ray picture he was the only kid I could recall clearly out of a crowd of boys in torn knickers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tell me what you 've been doing , " I said , annoyed to find myself slipping into the hearty , slightly patronizing manner of the teacher . A little of the old childish restraint overcame the man as he gave his account Like a pupil called upon to recite . Few days ' leave . Appointment to meet a friend giving a lecture at the university . Walking around to kill a half-hour wait . Before that ? Army two years after finishing college . Future plans ? " I shall go on painting , " he said , as if I had asked the obvious . Our conversation lagged on the far side of intimacy . I could n't say , " Tell me how that little boy miraculously became you . " He broke an awkward pause . " Do you remember Miss Mulford ? " The question came as a shock . For so long I had felt that the woman whose life had ended in a blank finality had gone on existing only in my own mind . " Yes , I do , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a schoolboy 's flippant comment that I expected to hear . He must have been hoping for a different reaction from me , because he spoke with an edge of defense in his voice . " She was the best teacher I ever knew . She helped us to grow from our background instead of kicking it aside and cutting ourselves in two . " He was a little puzzled by the warmth with which I said , " I 'm glad you knew that , even though you were a child then . " " Maybe I did n't see it then . You know how you keep on dragging up things you did n't seem to notice as a kid , and fitting them into a meaning of your own . The people of our neighborhood had great respect for the only American they knew as a friend . They used to call her simply " Teacher . " She left me some money to go to college . I grew up somewhat set apart in an aura of wonder because she had marked out a line for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother felt that I had been sort of taken out of their hands . " " How did she get to know your people ? " I asked . " It was all but impossible to get any of them to come to school . " " Yes  --  I remember . They were never called unless there was trouble , and then the best defense was to act dumb . Most of them understood enough English if it was convenient . Miss Mulford used to come to us . She spoke Italian and the Sicilian dialect . Whenever anybody needed help , like going to court with a bad boy , or having a row with the relief investigators , they sent a message through a child asking her to come . " " Did you know that she was especially interested in you ? " I asked . " No . That 's the funny part of it . I never thought that she noticed me more than anybody else . She had been generous to lots of others . / remember that she used to come to our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen table . They talked about the old country and told stories or argued . I was usually at one corner , not paying much attention , drawing pictures on a roll of white shelf paper that I wound on two sticks like a Roman book . " As I listened to Pat , the old pity and regret that had disturbed me was dissolved in a new understanding . He spoke of a woman who stood above my sense of guilt and shame . They had never touched her . I had only violated a picture that I had set up of myself . Pat rose to go , hesitated , and then said in a too-casual manner that betrayed more importance than he cared to show , " When I got out of college I went to thank the lawyer who had taken care of the money . He said to me , ' You 're lucky . So many of those sentimental , thwarted old maids leave their money to cat hospitals . ' . . . If that 's all it meant , it would n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her at all , did he ? " He looked to me for reassurance . " He knew nothing about her , " I said , emphatically . As I watched his tall straight figure cross the street / thought to myself , " There goes Miss Mulford 's instinct for immortality . " A REQUEST RICHARD DYER MACCANN GIVE me a simple call to arms . Do not paint your pages With the indelicate traceries Of gaudy , hired poetics . Do not daub the walls With glittering stories of my duty done . Do not draw me many-colored pictures : I do not wish to sell your goods . Give me a simple call to arms , With plain words of explanation And the deeds to match , And I will listen with respect .
