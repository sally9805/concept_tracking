THIS place looks like a saloon of the old romantic West , including a stairway to a mezzanine floor , which has a porch . A man in full cowboy regalia comes out of a mezzanine-floor room , walks bowlegged along the porch and enters another room , making a lot of noise with his high-heeled boots . He comes out of this room suddenly and spits a mouthful of chewing tobacco juice at a man who is asleep on top of a table . He misses . Another man , in long underwear , over which is buckled a gun and holster , comes out of a room in a daze , scratches himself , looks around , and goes back into the room . This man is also bowlegged . The bartender is reading a big poster offering eleven dollars for the capture of Joe Ferguson , dead or alive . A man named SHORTY comes in with a lot of hard-boiled bowlegged swagger , draws his pistol , which is very big , and fires six times . PETE , the bartender , who speaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's through shooting . PETE What 'll you have , stranger ? SHORTY I 'm looking for a man named Ferguson . PETE Friend of yourn ?

PETE How do you make them Martinis , pardner ? SHORTY Well , pardner , it 's no trick at all . Here . Let me have some of that equipment . ( He goes behind the bar . Fusses with bottles , glasses , and occasionally rings the cash register and takes out a dollar or two , one of which he rings on the bar and rejects as counterfeit ) To make a dry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a little lemon peel . Any lemon around here ? PETE Nope . SHORTY Well , you make it without lemon peel , then . Any time you have n't got a lemon you go to work , pardner , and make it without the peel . Here .

PETE Sure . ( To SHORTY ) She 's going to put something on . SHORTY Something in blue ? Blue taffeta or something like that ? PETE ( Calling ) Make it something in blue , Lola . Blue taffeta or something like that . LOLA 'S VOICE The only thing I 've got in blue taffeta is a swimming suit . PETE ( To SHORTY ) Is that all right ? SHORTY Well  --  all right . PETE ( Calling ) That 's all right , Lola . Hurry now . Do n't keep the gentleman waiting . p. 7 LOLA I 'll be right down . A player-piano starts going , LOLA comes down a slide which has been hidden by paper , breaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lands pertly on her feet , and is off to the races , dancing like mad . After a substantial solo , everybody in the joint , excepting the sleeping drunk , joins the dance , and the man in underwear slides down the slide , makes a couple of dance turns and leaps , scrambles up the stairs , and comes down the slide again , and again . LOLA and SHORTY do a Western-style courtship dance , during which SHORTY draws his gun every time LOLA is just a little too coquettish . The mezzanine-floor cowboy comes down the slide , too , and does a little plain and fancy lariat work . PETE the bartender struts around . A lean prairie preacher comes into the place and tries to halt the revelry  --  without success . PETE keeps offering him a drink until he weakens and puts away six in quick succession , after which he is drunk and begins to chase LOLA , throwing away his frock , or coat , in the process . He is unable to catch LOLA who runs up the stairs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the man in underwear . LOLA slides down the slide , followed by the men , and this continues as long as it 's interesting or amusing or absurd . By this time the orchestra has joined the player-piano and the music is extremely pure and classic , instead of shabby . Next there is a play of hide and seek on the mezzanine floor , with LOLA running into one room , and dancing out of another , followed by all the men . At last she comes out of a room alone , comes down the slide , and does a kind of square dance with PETE the bartender . The dance becomes increasingly swift , and then slow , and gradually becomes a walk , then a standstill , each of them flat on their feet , but still moving . When they stop moving , the music stops . A little girl with beautiful black hair that is almost as long as she is tall comes dancing in shyly and finally discovers the drunk sleeping on the table : her father ! She dances around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up rudely . PETE and LOLA stand at the bar drinking . At last the little girl begins to shake her father gently , but he is sound asleep . After a real good shaking , he wakes up with a start , draws his six-shooter and fires six times , then notices his daughter and hangs his head in shame . The girl pantomimes singing , while a violin speaks for her , on the theme of Father , oh , Father , come home with me now , and so on . He asks for a drink , but PETE wants money . The drunk searches his pockets , but ca n't find any money . His daughter tugs at his coattail , but he brushes her away , begging for a drink . Finally , he begins to make offers to PETE , for a drink , but PETE rejects each offer : the drunk 's six-shooter , his coat , and so on . Finally , the drunk offers his daughter to PETE for a drink . PETE accepts the offer , which arouses the jealousy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation resolves itself into a dance , consisting largely of a chase , upstairs and down the slide , with the preacher , SHORTY , and the man in underwear joining in on the fun . The drunk , in the meantime , is hitting the bottle sixty miles an hour , and soon does a slow-motion , bowlegged dance , after which he goes back to sleep on the table . At last PETE the bartender catches up with the drunkard 's little daughter . But just in time the old hero come West from Yale or Harvard arrives , as if by fast horse , leaps into the barroom and hurries to the rescue of his prairie flower . There is a rough-and-tumble fight with PETE , while the little girl and LOLA worry about the fighters . The fight is full of all the dirty tricks of Western fighting : gouging of eyes , kicks in the stomach , and so on . At last young Harvard disposes of PETE , only to face a very angry SHORTY . After the same kind of fight , SHORTY is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then the cowboy . Then the preacher . They are all stretched out on the floor . Harvard turns to the drunkard 's daughter and is about to embrace her tenderly when the drunkard wakes up and seeks to protect his daughter from the Eastern educated interloper . Another quarrel , with the poor little girl 's sympathy torn between her father and her sweetheart . At last her father is stretched out beside the others . Just as Harvard is about to carry the little Western princess away with him , Indians arrive , whooping like kingdom come . They come in through the door , through windows , and down the slide , with Harvard wrestling each of them , as they arrive , and the little girl trying to wake up the other Americans on the floor , so they can save her hero . Along with the Indians , an Indian maid named Redwing comes down the slide and while everybody is quarreling , one American with one Indian . She does a beautiful love or rain dance . A big sheriff comes in , and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again and is pushed out by an Indian . This keeps up for quite a while . Finally , everything gets confused and LOLA and a young Indian buck begin falling in love with each other , dancing . The whole ballet ends on this principle : one Indian girl for every American ; one American girl for every Indian ; Harvard for the drunkard 's daughter ; and a grand finale of American happiness and dancing .
