txt CHAMBERLAIN DIES ; BRITAIN MOURNING HER FORMER CHIEF Death at 5:30 P. M. , Saturday , Not Announced to Country Till Sunday Forenoon LEADERS VOICE TRIBUTES Ex-Prime Minister ** in effort to Appease Hitler and Thus Avert War By RAYMOND DANIELL Special Cable to THE NEW Yowl : TIMES . LONDON , Nov. ** a low rambling farmhouse among tall larches in the heart of Hampshire Neville Chamberlain , former Prime Minister , lies dead tonight . The man who thought by trade with the dictators at Munich he could assure " peace in our time " was not permitted to see even the outcome of the war to which he reluctantly committed his country after his efforts at appeasement failed . The Birmingham business man who was one of the most controversial figures of his time died at 5:30 yesterday afternoon , but it was not until 10:20 this morning that the news of his passing was disclosed to the public . Many dwellers in the straggling cottages near the quiet house where Mr. Chamberlain passed his last days learned of his death through the official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grounds of Heckfield House , within whose camouflaged walls Mr. Chamberlain sank into a coma yesterday with his wife and sisters at his bedside , is the fine old Norman Church of St. Michael . The Vicar , the Rev. H. R. P. Tringham , and the members of the congregation who attended the morning service were as ignorant of what had happened among them as the rest of the country . Prayer Offered After Death Just before the beginning of his sermon the Vicar suggested a prayer for Mr. Chamberlain , " who is very , very seriously ill . " It was Armistice Sunday and the church was fairly well filled with veterans of the war and soldiers and home guards serving in this one . At vespers , attended by a small number of countryfolk , the Vicar paid a tribute to the memory of the man for whom they had prayed earlier in the day . Mr. Tringham said : " The first thought that comes to one referring to Mr. Chamberlain is , ' Blessed are the peacemakers , for they shall be called the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harder for our peace and although it seemed a failure it was a grand failure . The man , because of his ideals and unselfishness , was an inspiration not only to us but also to generations to come and probably what he has done was as great a work as that of people who had easy success . " It is expected the body will be brought to London for a state funeral . Soon after the announcement of Mr. Chamberlain 's death was received in his home city , Birmingham , where he had served as Lord Mayor and where his father and brothers had rendered distinguished civic service , flags on public buildings were lowered to half staff . Some followers in his constituency , Edgbaston , wore mourning brassards . The Rev. Noel Hutchcroft , head of the Methodist Mission in Birmingham , expressed the feelings of has fellow-citizens when he said : " His loyalty to his beliefs defied the material danger to which his // CHAMBERLAIN DIES ; BRITAIN MOURNING // ideals exposed him . Men of later generations will speak of him not as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invincible spiritual reality . " Mr. Chamberlain 's illness began last August when he was Lord Privy Seal . At that time he underwent what his doctors described in a bulletin as " a successful operation for relief of intestinal symptoms of an obstructive nature . " Whether the operation was " successful " or not , Mr. Chamberlain , who was 71 , never really recovered and on Oct. 3 resigned as Lord Privy Seal . Last Friday his wife disclosed his illness had taken a grave turn . When Parliament meets again tributes will be paid to the memory of Britain 's leader in the early days of the war by men who served under him , including Winston Churchill , his successor as Prime Minister . It has not been decided whether Parliament will adjourn afterward until the following day , but it would not be surprising if the House of Commons decided the best way to respect Mr. Chamberlain 's determination to win the war he entered so reluctantly would be to carry on business as usual . It was noted by older members of the House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former Prime Minister , died on the night of Nov. 9 . The death of Mr. Chamberlain leaves only one former Prime Minister , David Lloyd George , In the House of Commons , for Earl Baldwin sits in the House of Lords . Expressions of regret over Mr. 1Chamberlain 's passing came from persons of all shades of opinion . Among them was Leslie Hore-Belisha , former War Minister , whose resignation Mr. Chamberlain demanded early in the war , precipitating one of the rare political crises since hostilities began . Mr. Hore-Belisha said : " I am glad now to feel that when , II after four months of war , the 1 breach in our association came I was unable to respond to his appeal to continue my services under I him and that I was able to meet his request in the circumstances of the time to refrain from controversy and thus spare him from additional anxiety . " History will judge his achievements but his contemporaries will be of one accord in praising his high character , his elevated standards of duty , his industrious devotion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember his personal qualities of kindness and humanity and the unaffected character of his life . " Others who joined in expressing sorrow were Clement R. Attlee , Labor party leader ; Sir Douglas Hacking , chairman of the Conservative party ; General Wladislas Sikorski , Polish Premier ; L. S. Amery , Secretary of State for pidia , and Colonel Wilfred Martineau , Lord Mayor of Birmingham . Tributes From Two Laborites LONDON , Nov. 10 ( UP ) ? Ernest Bevin , Minister of Labor , paid the following tribute to Neville Cham-berlain : " I learned with regret of the passing of Chamberlain . Whatever opinion may have been held in the different sections of the community as to the policy he pursued , no one could question his honesty of purpose , integrity or courage . " His outlook appeared to us to be limited , having regard to the terrific forces developing around us , but that was only characteristic of the Conservative circles in which he moved . We never doubted his determination to see the war through to victory once the die was cast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him was there ever a sign of flinching in his purpose . " In affairs et ' the nation I feel his passing will be looked upon as the passing of an age . The world he knew will never return . " James Maxton , Labor Member of Parliament , said : " I think he was very unfortunate in the part he had to play . I was profoundly impressed with his effort at Munich to preserve wcrld peace . Looking back now , I feel that by that time it was too late . He had inherited a situation from predecessors which was beyond repair . "
