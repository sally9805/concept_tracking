This was the brackish taste of defeat that American soldiers had not known in a major battle since Appomattox . To the grim , battle-weary soldiers of General Douglas MacArthur , backed up into the mountainous fastnesses of the Bataan peninsula , northwest of abandoned Manila , or desperately fending off Japanese attacks on the great harbor fortress of Corregidor , this was it . <P> It had been inevitable since the Jap smash at Pearl Harbor , his decisive slices into the Philippines ' supply line at Wake and Guam . From then on it was a desperate , stubborn , downhill retreat before a foe of overwhelming numbers . The Jap admitted to the folks back home that his own losses were " colossal , " that U.S. and Filipino troops fought " like demons . " But he had command of the sea and the air . <P> The pursuits flown with dash and gallantry by stringy Filipinos and husky American boys were finally used up . The bombers that had sunk the ships of the Jap were gone . As the Jap neared Manila @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jap knew as did the American soldier that there would be no more to worry about for a long time . Maybe never . <P> The Shadow . Backing up in good order , taking their collections in casualties from the invader , Douglas MacArthur and his men had plenty to think about besides the battle . <P> While they fought and worked with coolness and precision at their staff and supply work , they must have thought of the American women on Luzon . Many of them , perhaps all of them , were now in the areas held by the Jap . Army &; Navy men could thank their Government 's forethought in ordering service families out of the islands . All were gone , except Douglas MacArthur 's wife and three-year-old son , when war struck . <P> But the wives and daughters of U.S. civilians were still there , and the Japanese were strutting . In abandoned Manila they ordered all whites to stay indoors or be shot . From his fortress in the harbor , Douglas MacArthur charged that this treatment of U.S. civilians was already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MacArthur knew what he had to do . The naval base at Cavite , on the south shore of the harbor , had already been abandoned , its stores removed or destroyed . Admiral Tommy Hart had snaked his ships out and away to the open sea . The Army was disposed in a crescent about Manila with its right flank in the narrow neck south of the town , its left sweeping north and westward into the Bataan peninsula . <P> The Retreat . Manila was an unequivocal liability . It lies in flat land with its back to the bay . It could be only a trap-a soft spot for a wedge to be driven home by the Jap to split the Army . As he had long planned to do in a last-ditch fight , General MacArthur abandoned Manila , already declared an open city , already heavily bombed . <P> The careful training of U.S. forces paid handsome dividends . U.S. troops moved their guns and trains in good order . <P> Before the week 's end the withdrawal had been skillfully completed . The Army of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of roads , tough for armored-force operations , ideal for making the Jap pay for what he might eventually get . He made his first payment as this week began . Douglas MacArthur announced the Jap had lost at least 700 killed in a single , thwarted attack on the U.S. lines .
