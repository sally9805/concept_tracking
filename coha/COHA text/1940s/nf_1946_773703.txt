txt // is to tax successful private business in order to support unsuccessful private business . Under certain emergency circumstances there may be a plausible argument for this , the merits of which we need not examine here . But in the long run it does not sound like a paying proposition from the standpoint of the country as a whole . And experience has shown that it is n't . C H A P T E R V I I THE CURSE OF MACHINERY Morro the most viable of all economic delusions is the belief that machines on net balance create unemployment . Destroyed a thousand times , it has risen a thousand times out of its own ashes as hardy and vigorous as ever . Whenever there is long-continued mass unemployment , machines get the blame anew . This fallacy is still the basis of many labor union practices . The public tolerates these practices because it either believes at bottom that the unions are right , or is too confused to see just why they are wrong . The belief that machines cause unemployment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conclusions . Not only must we be causing unemployment with every technological improvement we make today , but primitive man must have started causing it with the first efforts he made to save himself from needless toil and sweat . To go no further back , let us turn to Adam Smith 's The Wealth of Nations , published in 1776 . The first chapter of this remarkable book is called " Of the Division of Labor , " and on the second page of , this first chapter the author tells us that a workman unacquainted with the use 41 // of machinery employed in pin-making " could scarce make one pin a day , and certainly could not make twenty , " but that with the use of this machinery he can make 4,800 pins a day . So already , alas , in Adam Smith 's time , machinery had thrown from 240 to 4,800 pin-makers out of work for every one it kept . In the pin-making industry there was already , if machines merely throw men out of jobs , 99.98 per cent unemployment . Could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Industrial Revolution was just in its infancy . Let us look at some of the incidents and aspects of that revolution . Let us see , for example , what happened in the stocking industry . New stocking frames as they were introduced were destroyed by the handicraft workmen ( over i , 000 in a single riot ) , houses were burned , the inventors were threatened and obliged to fly for their lives , and order was not finally restored until the military had been called out and the leading rioters had been either transported or hanged . Now it is important to bear in mind that in so far as the rioters were thinking of their own immediate or even longer futures their opposition to the machine was rational . For William Felkin , in his History of the MachineWrought Hosiery Manufactures ( 1867 ) , tells us that the larger part of the 50,000 English stocking knitters and their families did not fully emerge from the hunger and misery entailed by the introduction of the machine for the next forty years . But in so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did , that the machine was permanently displacing men , they were mistaken , for before // the end of the nineteenth century the stocking industry was employing at least a hundred men for every man it employed at the beginning of the century . Arkwright invented his cotton-spinning machinery in 1760 . At that time it was estimated that there were in England 5,200 spinners using spinning wheels , and 2,700 weavers ? in all , 7,960 persons engaged in the production of cotton textiles . The introduction of Arkwright 's invention was opposed on the ground that it threatened the livelihood of the workers , and the opposition had to be put down by force . Yet in 1787 ? twenty-seven years after the invention appeared ? a parliamentary inquiry showed that the number of persons actually engaged in the spinning and weaving of cotton had risen from 7,900 to 320,000 , an increase of 4,400 per cent . If the reader will consult such a book as Recent Economic Changes , by David A. Wells , published in 1889 , he will find passages that , except for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written by our technophobes ( if I may coin a needed word ) of today . Let me quote a few : During the ten years from 1870 to 188o , inclusive , the British mercantile marine increased its movement , in the matter of foreign entries and clearances alone , to the extent of 22,000,000 tons . . . yet the number of men who were employed in effecting this great movement had decreased in 1880 , as compared with 1870 , to the extent of about three thousand ( 2,990 exactly ) . What did it ? The introduction of steam-hoisting ma44 ECONOMICS IN ONE LESSON chines and grain elevators upon the wharves and docks , the employment of steam power , etc ... . In 1873 Bessemer steel in England , where its price had not been enhanced by protective duties , commanded $8o per ton ; in 1886 it was profitably manufactured and sold in the same country for less than $20 per ton . Within the same time the annual production capacity of a Bessemer converter has been increased fourfold , with no increase but rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capacity already being exerted by the steam engines of the world in existence and working in the year 1887 has been estimated by the Bureau of Statistics at Berlin as equivalent to that of 200,000,000 horses , representing approximately 1,000,000,000 men ; or at least three times the working population of the earth ... . One would think that this last figure would have caused Mr. Wells to pause , and wonder why there was any employment left in the world of 1889 at all ; but he merely concluded , with restrained pessimism , that " under such circumstances industrial overproduction . . . may become chronic . " In the depression of 1932 , the game of blaming unemployment on the machines started all over again . Within a few months the doctrines of a group calling themselves the Technocrats had spread through the country like a forest fire . I shall not weary the reader with a recital of the fantastic figures put forward by this group or with correcTHE // tions to show what the real facts were . It is enough to say that the Technocrats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machines permanently displace men ? except that , in their ignorance , they presented this error as a new and revolutionary discovery of their own . It was simply one more illustration of Santayana 's aphorism that those who can not remember the past are condemned to repeat it . The Technocrats were finally laughed out of existence ; but their doctrine , which preceded them , lingers on . It is reflected in hundreds of make-work rules and feather-bed practices by labor unions ; and these rules and practices are tolerated and even approved because of the confusion on this point in the public mind . Testifying on behalf of the United States Department of Justice before the Temporary National Economic Committee ( better known as the TNEC ) in March , 1941 , Corwin Edwards cited innumerable examples of such practices . The electrical union in New York City was charged with refusal to install electrical equipment made outside of New York State unless the equipment was disassembled and reassembled at the job site . In Houston , Texas , master plumbers and the plumbing union agreed that piping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the thread were cut off one end of the pipe and new thread were cut at the job site . Various locals of the painters ' union imposed restrictions on the use of sprayguns , restrictions in many cases designed merely to make work by requiring the slower process of applying paint // with a brush . A local of the teamsters ' union required that every truck entering the New York metropolitan area have a local driver in addition to the driver already employed . In various cities the electrical union required that if any temporary light or power was to be used on a construction job there must be a full-time maintenance electrician , who should not be permitted to do any electrical construction work . This rule , according to Mr. Edwards , " often involves the hiring of a man who spends his day reading or playing solitaire and does nothing except throw a switch at the beginning and end of the day . " One could go on to cite such make-work practices in many other fields . In the railroad industry , the unions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not need them . In the theaters unions insist on the use of scene shifters even in plays in which no scenery is used . The musicians ' union requires so-called " stand-in " musicians or even whole orchestras to be employed in many cases where only phonograph records are needed . 2 One might pile up mountains of figures to show how wrong were the technophobes of the past . But it would do no good unless we understood clearly why they were wrong . For statistics and history are useless in economics unless accompanied by a basic deductive understanding of the facts ? which means in this case an understanding of why the past consequences of the introduction of machinTHE // ery and other labor-saving devices had to occur . Otherwise the technophobes will assert ( as they do in fact assert when you point out to them that the prophecies of their predecessors turned out to be absurd ) : " That may have been all very well in the past ; but today conditions are fundamentally different ; and now we simply can not afford to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , indeed , in a syndicated newspaper column of September 19 , 1945 , wrote : " We have reached a point today where labor-saving devices are good only when they do not throw the worker out of his job . " If it were indeed true that the introduction of labor saving machinery is a cause of constantly mounting unemployment and misery , the logical conclusions to be drawn would be revolutionary , not only in the technical field but for our whole concept of civilization . Not only should we have to regard all further technical progress as a calamity ; we should have to regard all past technical progress with equal horror . Every day each of us in his own capacity is engaged in trying to reduce the effort it requires to accomplish a given result . Each of us is trying to save his own labor , to economize the means required to achieve his ends . Every employer , small as well as large , seeks constantly to gain his results more economically and efficiently ? that is , by saving labor . Every intelligent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his assigned job . The most ambitious of us try tirelessly to increase the results we can achieve in a given number of hours . The technophobes , if they were logical and con48 ECONOMICS IN ONE LESSON sistent , would have to dismiss all this progress and ingenuity as not only useless but vicious . Why should freight be carried from New York to Chicago by railroads when we could employ enormously more men , for example , to carry it all on their backs ? Theories as false as this are never held with logical consistency , but they do great harm because they are held at all . Let us , therefore , try to see exactly what happens when technical improvements and labor-saving machinery are introduced . The details will vary in each instance , depending upon the particular conditions that prevail in a given industry or period . But we shall assume an example that involves the main possibilities . Suppose a clothing manufacturer learns of a machine that will make men 's and women 's overcoats for half as much labor as previously . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This looks at first glance like a clear loss of employment . But the machine itself required labor to make it ; so here , as one offset , are jobs that would not otherwise have existed . The manufacturer , however , would have adopted the machine only if it had either made better suits for half as much labor , or had made the same kind of suits at a smaller cost . If we assume the latter , we can not assume that the amount of labor to make the machines was as great in terms of payrolls as the amount of labor that the clothing manufacturer hopes to save in the long run by adopting the machine ; otherwise there would have been no economy , and he would not have adopted it . // So there is still a net loss of employment to be accounted for . But we should at least keep in mind the real possibility that even the first effect of the introduction of labor-saving machinery may be to increase employment on net balance ; because it is usually only in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by adopting the machine : it may take several years for the machine to " pay for itself . " After the machine has produced economies sufficient to offset its cost , the clothing manufacturer has more profits than before . ( We shall assume that he merely sells his coats for the same price as his competitors , and makes no effort to undersell them . ) At this point , it may seem , labor has suffered a net loss of employment , while it is only the manufacturer , the capitalist , who has gained . But it is precisely out of these extra profits that the subsequent social gains must come . The manufacturer must use these extra profits in at least one of three ways , and possibly he will use part of them in all three : ( r ) he will use the extra profits to expand his operations by buying more machines to make more coats ; or ( z ) he will invest the extra profits in some other industry ; or ( 3 ) he will spend the extra profits on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he takes , he will increase employment . In other words , the manufacturer , as a result of his economies , has profits that he did not have before . Every dollar of the amount he has saved in direct wages to former coat makers , he now has to pay out in indirect wages to the makers of the new machine , or to the workers in an50 ECONOMICS IN ONE LESSON other capital industry , or to the makers of a new house or motor car for himself , or of jewelry and furs for his wife . In any case ( unless he is a pointless hoarder ) he gives indirectly as many jobs as he ceased to give directly . But the matter does not and can not rest at this stage . If this enterprising manufacturer effects great economies as compared with his competitors , either he will begin to expand his o " erations at their expense , or they will start buying the machines too . Again more work will be given to the makers of the machines . But competition and production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overcoats . There will no longer be as great profits for those who adopt the new machines . The rate of profit of the manufacturers using the new machine will begin to drop , while the manufacturers who have still not adopted the machine may now make no profit at all . The savings , in other words , will begin to be passed along to the buyers of overcoats ? to the consumers . But as overcoats are now cheaper , more people will buy them . This means that , though it takes fewer people to make the same number of overcoats as before , more overcoats are now being made than before . If the demand for overcoats is what economists call " elastic " ? that is , if a fall in the price of overcoats causes a larger total amount of money to be spent on overcoats than previously ? then more people may be employed even in making overcoats than before the new labor-saving machine was introduced . We have already seen how this actually happened historically with stockings and other textiles . // But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand for the particular product involved . Suppose that , though the price of overcoats was almost cut in half ? from a former price , say , of $50 to a new price of $3o ? not a single additional coat was sold . The result would be that while consumers were as well provided with new overcoats as before , each buyer would now have $20 left over that he would not have had left over before . He will therefore spend this $zo for something else , and so provide increased employment in other lines . In brief , on net balance machines , technological improvements , economies and efficiency do not throw men out of work . 3 Not all inventions and discoveries , of course , are " laborsaving " machines . Some of them , like precision instruments , like nylon , lucite , plywood and plastics of all kinds , simply improve the quality of products . Others , like the telephone or the airplane , perform operations that direct human labor could not perform at all . Still others bring into existence objects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubber , that would otherwise not even exist . But in the foregoing illustration we have taken precisely the kind of machine that has been the special object of modern technophobia . It is possible , of course , to push too far the argument that machines do not on net balance throw men out of work . It is sometimes argued , for example , that machines // create more jobs than would otherwise have existed . Under certain conditions this may be true . They can certainly create enormously more jobs in particular trades . The eighteenth century figures for the textile industries are a case in point . Their modern counterparts are certainly no less striking . In 1910 , 140,000 persons were employed in the United States in the newly created automobile industry . In 1920 , as the product was improved and its cost reduced , the industry employed 250,000 . In 1930 , as this product improvement and cost reduction continued , employment in the industry was 380,000 . In 1940 it had risen to 450,000 . By 1940 , 35,000 people were employed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry . So it has been in one newly created trade after another , as the invention was improved and the cost reduced . There is also an absolute sense in which machines may be said to have enormously increased the number of jobs . The population of the world today is three times as great as in the middle of the eighteenth century , before the Industrial Revolution had got well under way . Machines may be said to have given birth to this increased population ; for without the machines , the world would not have been able to support it . Two out of every three of us , therefore , may be said to owe not only our jobs but our very lives to machines . Yet it is a misconception to think of the function or result of machines as primarily one of creating jobs . The real result of the machine is to increase production , to raise the standard of living , to increase economic welfare . // It is no trick to employ everybody , even ( or especially ) in the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long , weary , back-breaking employment ? is characteristic of precisely the nations that are most retarded industrially . Where full employment already exists , new machines , inventions and discoveries can not ? until there has been time for an increase in population ? bring more employment . They are likely to bring more unemployment ( but this time I am speaking of voluntary and not involuntary unemployment ) because people can now afford to work fewer hours , while children and the over-aged no longer need to work . What machines do , to repeat , is to bring an increase in production and an increase in the standard of living . They may do this in either of two ways . They do it by making goods cheaper for consumers ( as in our illustration of the overcoats ) , or they do it by increasing wages because they increase the productivity of the workers . In other words , they either increase money wages or , by reducing prices , they increase the goods and services that the same money wages will buy . Sometimes they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the monetary policy pursued in a country . But in any case , machines , inventions and discoveries increase real wages . 4 A warning is necessary before we leave this subject . It was precisely the great merit of the classical economists that they looked for secondary consequences , that they // were concerned with the effects of a given economic policy or development in the long run and on the whole community . But it was also their defect that , in taking the long view and the broad view , they sometimes neglected to take also the short view and the narrow view . They were too often inclined to minimize or to forget altogether the immediate effects of developments on special groups . We have seen , for example , that the English stocking knitters suffered real tragedies as a result of the introduction of the new stocking frames , one of the earliest inventions of the Industrial Revolution . But such facts and their modern counterparts have led some writers to the opposite extreme of looking only at the immediate effects on certain groups . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduction of some new machine . " Keep your eye on Joe Smith , " these writers insist . " Never lose track of Joe Smith . " But what they then proceed to do is to keep their eyes only on Joe Smith , and to forget Tom Jones , who has just got a new job in making the new machine , and Ted Brown , who has just got a job operating one , and Daisy Miller , who can now buy a coat for half what it used to cost her . And because they think only of Joe Smith , they end by advocating reactionary and nonsensical policies . Yes , we should keep at least one eye on Joe Smith . He has been thrown out of a job by the new machine . Perhaps he can soon get another job , even a better one . But perhaps , also , he has devoted many years of his life to acquiring and improving a special skill for which the marTHE // ket no longer has any use . He has lost this investment in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former employer , perhaps , has lost his investment in old machines or processes suddenly rendered obsolete . He was a skilled workman , and paid as a skilled workman . Now he has become overnight an unskilled workman again , and can hope , for the present , only for the wages of an unskilled workman , because the one skill he had is no longer needed . We can not and must not forget Joe Smith . His is one of the personal tragedies that , as we shall see , are incident to nearly all industrial and economic progress . To ask precisely what course we should follow with Joe Smith ? whether we should let him make his own adjustment , give him separation pay or unemployment compensation , put him on relief , or train him at government expense for a new job ? would carry us beyond the point that we are here trying to illustrate . The central lesson is that we should try to see all the main consequences of any economic policy or development ? the immediate effects on special groups , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have devoted considerable space to this issue , it is because our conclusions regarding the effects of new machinery , inventions and discoveries on employment , production and welfare are crucial . If we are wrong about these , there are few things in economics about which we are likely to be right . CHAPTER VIII SPREAD-THE-WORK SCHEMES J HAVE referred to various union make-work and featherbed practices . These practices , and the public toleration of them , spring from the same fundamental fallacy as the fear of machines . This is the belief that a more efficient way of doing a thing destroys jobs , and its necessary corollary that a less efficient way of doing it creates them . Allied to this fallacy is the belief that there is just a fixed amount of work to be done in the world , and that , if we can not add to this work by thinking up more cumbersome ways of doing it , at least we can think of devices for spreading it around among as large a number of people as possible . This error lies behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the building trades in large cities the subdivision is notorious . Bricklayers are not allowed to use stones for a chimney : that is the special work of stonemasons . An electrician can not rip out a board to fix a connection and put it back again : that is the special job , no matter how simple it may be , of the carpenters . A plumber will not remove or put back a tile incident to fixing a leak in the shower : that is the job of a tile-setter . Furious " jurisdictional " strikes are fought among unions 56 // for the exclusive right to do certain types of borderline jobs . In a statement recently prepared by the American railroads for the Attorney-General 's Committee on Administrative Procedure , the roads gave innumerable examples in which the National Railroad Adjustment Board had decided that " each separate operation on the railroad , no matter how minute , such as talking over a telephone or spiking or unspiking a switch , is so far an exclusive property of a particular class of employe that if an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regular duties , performs such operations he must not only be paid an extra day 's wages for doing so , but at the same time the furloughed or unemployed members of the class held to be entitled to perform the operation must be paid a day 's wages for not having been called upon to perform it . " It is true that a few persons can profit at the expense of the rest of us from this minute arbitrary subdivision of labor ? provided it happens in their case alone . But those who support it as a general practice fail to see that it always raises production costs ; that it results on net balance in less work done and in fewer goods produced . The householder who is forced to employ two men to do the work of one has , it is true , given employment to one extra man . But he has just that much less money left over to spend on something that would employ somebody else . Because his bathroom leak has been repaired at double what it should have cost , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Labor " is no better off , because a day 's ememployment of an unneeded tilesetter has meant a day 's // disemployment of a sweater knitter or machine handler . The householder , however , is worse off . Instead of having a repaired shower and a sweater , he has the shower and no sweater . And if we count the sweater as part of the national wealth , the country is short one sweater . This symbolizes the net result of the effort to make extra work by arbitrary subdivision of labor . But there are other schemes for " spreading the work , " often put forward by union spokesmen and legislators . The most frequent of these is the proposal to shorten the working week , usually by law . The belief that it would " spread the work " and " give more jobs " was one of the main reasons behind the inclusion of the penalty-overtime provision in the existing Federal Wage-Hour Law . The previous legislation in the States , forbidding the employment of women or minors for more , say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conviction that longer hours were injurious to health and morale . Some of it was based on the belief that longer hours were harmful to efficiency . But the provision in the Federal law , that an employer must pay a worker a 50 per cent premium above his regular hourly late of wages for all hours worked in any week above forty , was not based primarily on the belief that forty-five hours a week , say , was injurious either to health or efficiency . It was inserted partly in the hope of boosting the worker 's weekly income , and partly in the hope that , by discouraging the employer from taking on anyone regularly for more than forty hours a week , it would force him to employ additional workers instead . At the time of // writing this , there are many schemes for " averting unemployment " by enacting a thirty-hour week . What is the actual effect of such plans , whether enforced by individual unions or by legislation ? It will clarify the problem if we consider two cases . The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours to thirty without any change in the hourly rate of pay . The second is a reduction in the working week from forty hours to thirty , but with a sufficient increase in hourly wage rates to maintain the same weekly pay for the individual workers already employed . Let us take the first case . We assume that the working week is cut from forty hours to thirty , with no change in hourly pay . If there is substantial unemployment when this plan is put into effect , the plan will no doubt provide additional jobs . We can not assume that it will provide sufficient additional jobs , however , to maintain the same payrolls and the same number of man-hours as before , unless we make the unlikely assumptions that in each industry there has been exactly the same percentage of unemployment and that the new men and women employed are no less efficient at their special tasks on the average than those who had already been employed . But suppose we do make these assumptions . Suppose we do assume that the right number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new workers do not raise production costs . What will be the result of reducing the working week from forty hours to thirty ( without any increase in hourly pay ) ? 6o ECONOMICS IN ONE LESSON Though more workers will be employed , each will be working fewer hours , and there will , therefore , be no net increase in man-hours . It is unlikely that there will be any significant increase in production . Total payrolls and " purchasing power " will be no larger . All that will have happened , even under the most favorable assumptions ( which would seldom be realized ) is that the workers previously employed will subsidize , in effect , the workers previously unemployed . For in order that the new workers will individually receive three-fourths as many dollars a week as the old workers used to receive , the old workers will themselves now individually receive only three-fourths as many dollars a week as previously . It is true that the old workers will now work fewer hours ; but this purchase of more leisure at a high price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own sake : it is a sacrifice made to provide others with jobs . The labor union leaders who demand shorter weeks to " spread the work " usually recognize this , and therefore they put the proposal forward in a form in which everyone is supposed to eat his cake and have it too . Reduce the working week from forty hours to thirty , they tell us , to provide more jobs ; but compensate for the shorter week by increasing the hourly rate of pay by 3373 per cent . The workers employed , say , were previously getting an average of $4o a week for forty hours work ; in order that they may still get $40 for only thirty hours work , the hourly rate of pay must be advanced to an average of $1.33/ What would be the consequences of such a plan ? The // first and most obvious consequence would be to raise costs of production . If we assume that the workers , when previously employed for forty hours , were getting less than the level of production costs , prices and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hourly increase without reducing the length of the working week . They could , in other words , have worked the same number of hours and got their total weekly incomes increased by one-third , instead of merely getting , as they are under the new thirtyhour week , the same weekly income as before . But if , under the forty-hour week , the workers were already getting as high a wage as the level of production costs and prices made possible ( and the very unemployment they are trying to cure may be a sign that they were already getting even more than this ) , then the increase in production costs as a result of the 3373 per cent increase in hourly wage rates will be much greater than the existing state of prices , production and costs can stand . The result of the higher wage rate , therefore , will be a much greater unemployment than before . The least efficient firms will be thrown out of business , and the least efficient workers will be thrown out of jobs . Production will be reduced all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will tend to raise prices , so that workers can buy less with the same dollar wages ; on the other hand , the increased unemployment will shrink demand and hence tend to lower prices . What ultimately happens to the prices of goods will depend upon what monetary policies are then followed . But if a policy of // monetary inflation is pursued , to enable prices to rise so that the increased hourly wages can be paid , this will merely be a disguised way of reducing real wage rates , so that these will return , in terms of the amount of goods they can purchase , to the same real rate as before . The result would then be the same as if the working week had been reduced without an increase in hourly wage rates . And the results of that have already been discussed . The spread-the-work schemes , in brief , rest on the same sort of illusion that we have been considering . The people who support such schemes think only of the employment they would provide for particular persons or groups ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be on everybody . The spread-the-work schemes rest also , as we began by pointing out , on the false assumption that there is just a fixed amount of work to be done . There could be no greater fallacy . There is no limit to the amount of work to be done as long as any human need or wish that work could fill remains unsatisfied . In a modern exchange economy , the most work will be done when prices , costs and wages are in the best relations to each other . What these relations are we shall later consider . C H A P T E R I X DISBANDING TROOPS AND BUREAUCRATS H W EN , after every great war , it is proposed to demobilize the armed forces , there is always a great fear that there will not be enough jobs for these forces and that in consequence they will be unemployed . It is true that , when millions of men are suddenly released , it may require time for private industry to reabsorb them ? though what has been chiefly remarkable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slowness , with which this was accomplished . The fears of unemployment arise because people look at only one side of the process . They see soldiers being turned loose on the labor market . Where is the " purchasing power " going to come from to employ them ? If we assume that the public budget is being balanced , the answer is simple . The government will cease to support the soldiers . But the taxpayers will be allowed to retain the funds that were previously taken from them in order to support the soldiers . And the taxpayers will then have additional funds to buy additional goods . Civilian demand , in other words , will be increased , and will give employment to the added labor force represented by the soldiers . 63 // If the soldiers have been supported by an unbalanced budget ? that is , by government borrowing and other forms of deficit financing ? the case is somewhat different . But that raises a different question : we shall consider the effects of deficit financing in a later chapter . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point that has just been made ; for if we assume that there is any advantage in a budget deficit , then precisely the same budget deficit could be maintained as before by simply reducing taxes by the amount previously spent in supporting the wartime army . But the demobilization will not leave us economically just where we were before it started . The soldiers previously supported by civilians will not become merely civilians supported by other civilians . They will become selfsupporting civilians . If we assume that the men who would otherwise have been retained in the armed forces are no longer needed for defense , then their retention would have been sheer waste . They would have been unproductive . The taxpayers , in return for supporting them , would have got nothing . But now the taxpayers turn over this part of their funds to them as fellow civilians in return for equivalent goods or services . Total national production , the wealth of everybody , is higher . 2 The same reasoning applies to civilian government officials whenever they are retained in excessive numbers and // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the remuneration they receive . Yet whenever any effort is made to cut down the number of unnecessary officeholders the cry is certain to be raised that this action is " deflationary . " Would you remove the " purchasing power " from these officials ? Would you injure the landlords and tradesmen who depend on that purchasing power ? You are simply cutting down " the national income " and helping to bring about or intensify a depression . Once again the fallacy comes from looking at the effects of this action only on the dismissed officeholders themselves and on the particular tradesmen who depend upon them . Once again it is forgotten that , if these bureaucrats are not retained in office , the taxpayers will be peiinitted to keep the money that was formerly taken from them for the support of the bureaucrats . Once again it is forgotten that the taxpayers ' income and purchasing power go up by at least as much as the income and purchasing power of the former officeholders go down . If the particular shopkeepers who formerly got the business of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much . Washington is less prosperous , and can , perhaps , support fewer stores ; but other towns can support more . Once again , however , the matter does not end there . The country is not merely as well off without the superfluous officeholders as it would have been had it retained them . It is much better off . For the officeholders must now seek private jobs or set up private businesses . And the added purchasing power of the taxpayers , as we noted in // the case of the soldiers , will encourage this . But the office . holders can take private jobs only by supplying equivalent services to those who provide the jobs ? or , rather , to the customers of the employers who provide the jobs . Instead of being parasites , they become productive men and women . I must insist again that in all this I am not talking of public officeholders whose services are really needed . Necessary policemen , firemen , street cleaners , health officers , judges , legislators and executives perform productive services as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make it possible for private industry to function in an atmosphere of law , order , freedom and peace . But their justification consists in the utility of their services . It does not consist in the " purchasing power " they possess by virtue of being on the public payroll . This " purchasing power " argument is , when one considers it seriously , fantastic . It could just as well apply to a racketeer or a thief who robs you . After he takes your money he has more purchasing power . He supports with it bars , restaurants , night clubs , tailors , perhaps automobile workers . But for every job his spending provides , your own spending must provide one less , because you have that much less to spend . Just so the taxpayers provide one less job for every job supplied by the spending of officeholders . When your money is taken by a thief , you get nothing in return . When your money is taken through taxes to support needless bureaucrats , precisely the same situation exists . We are lucky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy-going loafers . They are more likely today to be energetic reformers busily discouraging and disrupting production . When we can find no better argument for the retention of any group of officeholders than that of retaining their purchasing power , it is a sign that the time has come to get rid of them . CHAPTER X THE FETISH OF FULL EMPLOYMENT THE economic goal of any nation , as of any individual , is to get the greatest results with the least effort . The whole economic progress of mankind has consisted in getting more production with the same labor . It is for this reason that men began putting burdens on the backs of mules instead of on their own ; that they went on to invent the wheel and the wagon , the railroad and the motor truck . It is for this reason that men used their ingenuity to develop a hundred thousand labor-saving inventions . All this is so elementary that one would blush to state it if it were not being constantly forgotten by those who coin and circulate the new slogans . Translated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real objective is to maximize production . In doing this , full employment ? that is , the absence of involuntary idleness ? becomes a necessary by-product . But production is the end , employment merely the means . We can not continuously have the fullest production without full employment . But we can very easily have full employment without full production . 68 // Primitive tribes are naked , and wretchedly fed and housed , but they do not suffer from unemployment . China and India are incomparably poorer than ourselves , but the main trouble from which they suffer is primitive production methods ( which are both a cause and a consequence of a shortage of capital ) and not unemployment . Nothing is easier to achieve than full employment , once it is divorced from the goal of full production and taken as an end in itself . Hitler provided full employment with a huge armament program . The war provided full employment for every nation involved . The slave labor in Germany had full employment . Prisons and chain gangs have full employment . Coercion can always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Full Production bills in Congress but Full Employment bills . Even committees of business men recommend " a President 's Commission on Full Employment , " not on Full Production , or even on Full Employment and Full Production . Everywhere the means is erected into the end , and the end itself is forgotten . Wages and employment are discussed as if they had no relation to productivity and output . On the assumption that there is only a fixed amount of work to be done , the conclusion is drawn that a thirty-hour week will provide more jobs and will therefore be preferable to a forty-hour week . A hundred make-work practices of labor unions are confusedly tolerated . When a Petrillo threatens to put a radio station out of business unless it employs twice as // many musicians as it needs , he is supported by part of the public because he is after all merely trying to create jobs . When we had our WPA , it was considered a mark of genius for the administrators to think of projects that employed the largest number of men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in other words , in which labor was least efficient . It would be far better , if that were the choice ? which it is n't ? to have maximum production with part of the population supported in idleness by undisguised relief than to provide " full employment " by so many forms of disguised make-work that production is disorganized . The progress of civilization has meant the reduction of employment , not its increase . It is because we have become increasingly wealthy as a nation that we have been able virtually to eliminate child labor , to remove the necessity of work for many of the aged and to make it unnecessary for millions of women to take jobs . A much smaller proportion of the American population needs to work than that , say , of China or of Russia . The real question is not whether there will be 50,000,000 or 6o,000,000 jobs in America in 1950 , but how much shall we produce , and what , in consequence , will be our standard of living ? The problem of distribution , on which all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more easily solved the more there is to distribute . We can clarify our thinking if we put our chief emphasis where it belongs ? on policies that will maximize production . C H A P T E R X I WHO 'S " PROTECTED " BY TARIFFS ? A MERE recital of the economic policies of governments all over the world is calculated to cause any serious student of economics to throw up his hands in despair . What possible point can there be , he is likely to ask , in discussing refinements and advances in economic theory , when popular thought and the actual policies of governments , certainly in everything connected with international relations , have not yet caught up with Adam Smith ? For present-day tariff and trade policies are not only as bad as those in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries , but incomparably worse . The real reasons for those tariffs and other trade barriers are the same , and the pretended reasons are also the same . In the century and three-quarters since The Wealth of Nations appeared , the case for free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never with more direct simplicity and force than it was stated in that volume . In general Smith rested his case on one fundamental proposition : " In every country it always is and must be the interest of the great body of the people to buy whatever they want of those who sell it cheapest . " " The proposition is so 71 // very manifest , " Smith continued , " that it seems ridiculous to take any pains to prove it ; nor could it ever have been called in question , had not the interested sophistry of merchants and manufacturers confounded the common-sense of mankind . " From another point of view , free trade was considered as one aspect of the specialization of labor : It is the maxim of every prudent master of a family , never to attempt to make at home what it will cost him more to make than to buy . The tailor does not attempt to make his own shoes , but buys them of the shoemaker . The shoemaker does not attempt to make his own clothes , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one nor the other , but employs those different artificers . All of them find it for their interest to employ their whole industry in a way in which they have some advantage over their neighbors , and to purchase with a part of its produce , or what is the same thing , with the price of a part of it , whatever else they have occasion for . What is prudence in the conduct of every private family can scarce be folly in that of a great kingdom . But what ever led people to suppose that what was prudence in the conduct of every private family could be folly in that of a great kingdom ? It was a whole network of fallacies , out of which mankind has still been unable to cut its way . And the chief of them was the central fallacy with which this book is concerned . It was that of considering merely the immediate effects of a tariff on // special groups , and neglecting to consider its long-run effects on the whole community . 2 An American manufacturer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tells the committee or officials concerned that it would be a national disaster for them to remove or reduce the tariff on British sweaters . He now sells his sweaters for $ i 5 each , but English manufacturers could sell here sweaters of the same quality for $1o . A duty of $5 , therefore , is needed to keep him in business . He is not thinking of himself , of course , but of the thousand men and women he employs , and of the people to whom their spending in turn gives employment . Throw them out of work , and you create unemployment and a fall in purchasing power , which would spread in ever-widening circles . And if he can prove that he really would be forced out of business if the tariff were removed or reduced , his argument against that action is regarded by Congress as conclusive . But the fallacy comes from looking merely at this manufacturer and his employes , or merely at the American sweater industry . It comes from noticing only the results that are immediately seen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are prevented from coming into existence . The lobbyists for tariff protection are continually putting forward arguments that are not factually correct . But // let us assume that the facts in this case are precisely as the sweater manufacturer has stated them . Let us assume that a tariff of $5 a sweater is necessary for him to stay in business and provide employment at sweater-making for his workers . We have deliberately chosen the most unfavorable example of any for the removal of a tariff . We have not taken an argument for the imposition of a new tariff in order to bring a new industry into existence , but an argument for the retention of a tariff that has already brought an industry into existence , and can not be repealed without hurting somebody . The tariff is repealed ; the manufacturer goes out of business ; a thousand workers are laid off ; the particular tradesmen whom they patronized are hurt . This is the immediate result that is seen . But there are also results which , while much more difficult to trace , are no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that formerly cost $ i 5 apiece can be bought for $1o . Consumers can now buy the same quality of sweater for less money , or a much better one for the same money . If they buy the same quality of sweater , they not only get the sweater , but they have $5 left over , which they would not have had under the previous conditions , to buy something else . With the $10 that they pay for the imported sweater they help employment ? as the American manufacturer no doubt predicted ? in the sweater industry in England . With the $5 left over they help employment in any number of other industries in the United States . But the results do not end there . By buying English // sweaters they furnish the English with dollars to buy American goods here . This , in fact ( if I may here disregard such complications as multilateral exchange , loans , credits , gold movements , etc. which do not alter the end result ) is the only way in which the British can eventually make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British to sell more to us , they are now able to buy more from us . They are , in fact , eventually forced to buy more from us if their dollar balances are not to remain perpetually unused . So , as a result of letting in more British goods , we must export more American goods . And though fewer people are now employed in the American sweater industry , more people are employed ? and much more efficiently employed ? in , say , the American automobile or washing-machine business . American employment on net balance has not gone down , but American and British production on net balance has gone up . Labor in each country is more fully employed in doing just those things that it does best , instead of being forced to do things that it does inefficiently or badly . Consumers in both countries are better off . They are able to buy what they want where they can get it cheapest . American consumers are better provided with sweaters , and British consumers are better provided with motor cars and washing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other way round , and see the effect of imposing a tariff in the first place . Suppose that there had been no tariff on foreign knit goods , that ? 6 ECONOMICS IN ONE LESSON Americans were accustomed to buying foreign sweaters without duty , and that the argument were then put forward that we could bring a sweater industry into existence by imposing a duty of $5 on sweaters . There would be nothing logically wrong with this argument so far as it went . The cost of British sweaters to the American consumer might thereby be forced so high that American manufacturers would find it profitable to enter the sweater business . But American consumers would be forced to subsidize this industry . On every American sweater they bought they would be forced in effect to pay a tax of $5 which would be collected from them in a higher price by the new sweater industry . Americans would be employed in a sweater industry who had not previously been employed in a sweater industry . That much is true . But there would be no net @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employment . Because the American consumer had to pay $5 more for the same quality of sweater he would have just that much less left over to buy anything else . He would have to reduce his expenditures by $5 somewhere else . In order that one industry might grow or come into existence , a hundred other industries would have to shrink . In order that 20,000 persons might be employed in a sweater industry , 20,000 fewer persons would be employed elsewhere . But the new industry would be visible . The number of its employes , the capital invested in it , the market value of its product in terms of dollars , could be easily counted . The neighbors could see the sweater workers going to and // from the factory every day . The results would be palpable and direct . But the shrinkage of a hundred other industries , the loss of zo , 000 other jobs somewhere else , would not be so easily noticed . It would be impossible for even the cleverest statistician to know precisely what the incidence of the loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and women had been laid off from each particular industry , precisely how much business each particular industry had lost ? because consumers had to pay more for their sweaters . For a loss spread among all the other productive activities of the country would be comparatively minute for each . It would be impossible for anyone to know precisely how each consumer would have spent his extra $5 if he had been allowed to retain it . The overwhelming majority of the people , therefore , would probably suffer from the optical illusion that the new industry had cost us nothing . 4 It is important to notice that the new tariff on sweaters would not raise American wages . To be sure , it would enable Americans to work in the sweater industry at approximately the average level of American wages ( for workers of their skill ) , instead of having to compete in that industry at the British level of wages . But there would be no increase of American wages in general as a result of the duty ; for , as we have seen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jobs provided , no net increase in the demand for // goods , and no increase in labor productivity . Labor productivity would , in fact , be reduced as a result of the tariff . And this brings us to the real effect of a tariff wall . It is not merely that all its visible gains are offset by less obvious but no less real losses . It results , in fact , in a net loss to the country . For contrary to centuries of interested propaganda and disinterested confusion , the tariff reduces the American level of wages . Let us observe more clearly how it does this . We have seen that the added amount which consumers pay for a tariff-protected article leaves them just that much less with which to buy all other articles . There is here no net gain to industry as a whole . But as a result of the artificial barrier erected against foreign goods , American labor , capital and land are deflected from what they can do more efficiently to what they do less efficiently . Therefore , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of American labor and capital is reduced . If we look at it now from the consumer 's point of view , we find that he can buy less with his money . Because he has to pay more for sweaters and other protected goods , he can buy less of everything else . The general purchasing power of his income has therefore been reduced . Whether the net effect of the tariff is to lower money wages or to raise money prices will depend upon the monetary policies that are followed . But what is clear is that the tariff ? though it may increase wages above what they would have been in the protected industries ? must on net balance , when all occupations are considered , reduce real wages . // Only minds corrupted by generations of misleading propaganda can regard this conclusion as paradoxical . What other result could we expect from a policy of deliberately using our resources of capital and manpower in less efficient ways than we know how to use them ? What other result could we expect from deliberately erecting artificial obstacles to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has the same effect as the erection of real walls . It is significant that the protectionists habitually use the language of warfare . They talk of " repelling an invasion " of foreign products . And the means they suggest in the fiscal field are like those of the battlefield . The tariff barriers that are put up to repel this invasion are like the tank traps , trenches and barbed-wire entanglements created to repel or slow down attempted invasion by a foreign army . And just as the foreign army is compelled to employ more expensive means to surmount those obstacles ? bigger tanks , mine detectors , engineer corps to cut wires , ford streams and build bridges ? so more expensive and efficient transportation means must be developed to surmount tariff obstacles . On the one hand , we try to reduce the cost of transportation between England and America , or Canada and the United States , by developing faster and more efficient ships , better roads and bridges , better locomotives and motor trucks . On the other hand , we offset this investment in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more difficult to transport goods than it was before . We make it a dollar cheaper to ship the 8o ECONOMICS IN ONE LESSON sweaters , and then increase the tariff by two dollars to prevent the sweaters from being shipped . By reducing the freight that can be profitably carried , we reduce the value of the investment in transport efficiency . 5 The tariff has been described as a means of benefiting the producer at the expense of the consumer . In a sense this is correct . Those who favor it think only of the interests of the producers immediately benefited by the particular duties involved . They forget the interests of the consumers who are immediately injured by being forced to pay these duties . But it is wrong to think of the tariff issue as if it represented a conflict between the interests of producers as a unit against those of consumers as a unit . It is true that the tariff hurts all consumers as such . It is not true that it benefits all producers as such . On the contrary , as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the expense of all other American producers , and particularly of those who have a comparatively large potential export market . We can perhaps make this last point clearer by an exaggerated example . Suppose we make our tariff wall so high that it becomes absolutely prohibitive , and no imports come in from the outside world at all . Suppose , as a result of this , that the price of sweaters in America goes up only $5 . Then American consumers , because they have to pay $5 more for a sweater , will spend on the average five // cents less in each of a hundred other American industries . ( The figures are chosen merely to illustrate a principle : there will , of course , be no such symmetrical distribution of the loss ; moreover , the sweater industry itself will doubtless be hurt because of protection of still other industries . But these complications may be put aside for the moment . ) Now because foreign industries will find their market in America totally cut off , they will get no dollar exchange , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all . As a result of this , American industries will suffer in direct proportion to the percentage of their sales previously made abroad . Those that will be most injured , in the first instance , will be such industries as raw cotton producers , copper producers , makers of sewing machines , agricultural machinery , typewriters and so on . A higher tariff wall , which , however , is not prohibitive , will produce the same kind of results as this , but merely to a smaller degree . The effect of a tariff , therefore , is to change the structure of American production . It changes the number of occupations , the kind of occupations , and the relative size of one industry as compared with another . It makes the industries in which we are comparatively inefficient larger , and the industries in which we are comparatively efficient smaller . Its net effect , therefore , is to reduce American efficiency , as well as to reduce efficiency in the countries with which we would otherwise have traded more largely . In the long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a tariff is irrelevant to the question of // employment . ( True , sudden changes in the tariff , either upward or downward , can create temporary unemployment , as they force corresponding changes in the structure of production . Such sudden changes can even cause a depression . ) But a tariff is not irrelevant to the question of wages . In the long run it always reduces real wages , because it reduces efficiency , production and wealth . Thus all the chief tariff fallacies stem from the central fallacy with which this book is concerned . They are the result of looking only at the immediate effects of a single tariff rate on one group of producers , and forgetting the long-run effects both on consumers as a whole and on all other producers . ( I hear some reader asking : " Why not solve this by giving tariff protection to all producers ? " But the fallacy here is that this can not help producers uniformly , and can not help at all domestic producers who already " outsell " foreign producers : these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power brought about by the tariff. ) 6 On the subject of the tariff we must keep in mind one final precaution . It is the same precaution that we found necessary in examining the effects of machinery . It is useless to deny that a tariff does benefit ? or at least can benefit ? special interests . True , it benefits them at the expense of everyone else . But it does benefit them . If one industry alone could get protection , while its owners and // workers enjoyed the benefits of free trade in everything else they bought , that industry would benefit , even on net balance . As an attempt is made to extend the tariff blessings , however , even people in the protected industries , both as producers and consumers , begin to suffer from other people 's protection , and may finally be worse off even on net balance than if neither they nor anybody else had protection . But we should not deny , as enthusiastic free traders have so often done , the possibility of these tariff benefits to special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a reduction of the tariff would help everybody and hurt nobody . It is true that its reduction would help the country on net balance . But somebody would be hurt . Groups previously enjoying high protection would be hurt . That in fact is one reason why it is not good to bring such protected interests into existence in the first place . But clarity and candor of thinking compel us to see and acknowledge that some industries are right when they say that a removal of the tariff on their product would throw them out of business and throw their workers ( at least temporarily ) out of jobs . And if their workers have developed specialized skills , they may even suffer permanently , or until they have at long last learnt equal skills . In tracing the effects of tariffs , as in tracing the effects of machinery , we should endeavor to see all the chief effects , in both the short run and the long run , on all groups . As a postscript to this chapter I should add that ifs argument is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for revenue , or to keep alive industries // needed for war ; nor is it directed against all arguments for tariffs . It is merely directed against the fallacy that a tariff on net balance " provides employment , " " raises wages , " or " protects the American standard of living . " It does none of these things ; and so far as wages and the standard of living are concerned , it does the precise opposite . But an examination of duties imposed for other purposes would carry us beyond our present subject . Nor need we here examine the effect of import quotas , exchange controls , bilateralism and other devices in reducing , diverting or preventing international trade . Such devices have , in general , the same effects as high or prohibitive tariffs , and often worse effects . They present more complicated issues , but their net results can be traced through the same kind of reasoning that we have just applied to tariff barriers . C H A P T E R R I I T-IE DRIVE FOR EXPORTS EXCEEDED only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a pathological yearning for exports . Logically , it is true , nothing could be more inconsistent . In the long run imports and exports must equal each other ( considering both in the broadest sense , which includes such " invisible " items as tourist expenditures and ocean freight charges ) . It is exports that pay for imports , and vice versa . The greater exports we have , the greater imports we must have , if we ever expect to get paid . The smaller imports we have , the smaller exports we can have . Without imports we can have no exports , for foreigners will have no funds with which to buy our goods . When we decide to cut down our imports , we are in effect deciding also to cut down our exports . When we decide to increase our exports , we are in effect deciding also to increase our imports . The reason for this is elementary . An American exporter sells his goods to a British importer and is paid in British pounds sterling . But he can not use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to buy his wife 's clothes or to buy theater tickets . For all these purposes he needs American dollars . Therefore his British pounds are of no use 85 // to him unless he either uses them himself to buy British goods or sells them to some American importer who wishes to use them to buy British goods . Whichever he does , the transaction can not be completed until the American exports have been paid for by an equal amount of imports . The same situation would exist if the transaction had been conducted in terms of American dollars it instead of British pounds . The British importer could not pay the American exporter in dollars unless some previous British exporter had built up a credit in dollars here as a result of some previous sale to us . Foreign exchange , in short , is a clearing transaction in which , in America , the dollar debts of foreigners are cancelled against their dollar credits . In England , the pound sterling debts of foreigners are cancelled against their sterling credits . There is no reason to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be found in any good textbook on foreign exchange . But it should be pointed out that there is nothing inherently mysterious about it ( in spite of the mlystery in which it is so often wrapped ) , and that it does not differ essentially from what happens in domestic trade . Each of us must also sell something , even if for most of us it is our own services rather than goods , in order to get the purchasing power to buy . Domestic trade is also conducted in the main by crossing off checks and other claims against each other through clearing houses . It is true that under an international gold standard discrepancies in balances of imports and exports are sometimes settled by shipments of gold . But they could just as well // be settled by shipments of cotton , steel , whisky , perfume , or any other commodity . The chief difference is that the demand for gold is almost indefinitely expansible ( partly because it is thought of and accepted as a residual international " money " rather than as just another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obstacles in the way of receiving gold as they do in the way of receiving almost everything else . ( On the other hand , of late years they have taken to putting more obstacles in the way of exporting gold than in the way of exporting anything else : but that is another story . ) Now the same people who can be clearheaded and sensible when the subject is one of domestic trade can be incredibly emotional and muddleheaded when it becomes one of foreign trade . In the latter field they can seriously advocate or acquiesce in principles which they would think it insane to apply in domestic business . A typical example is the belief that the government should make huge loans to foreign countries for the sake of increasing our exports , regardless of whether or not these loans are likely to be repaid . American citizens , of course , should be allowed to lend their own funds abroad at their own risk . The government should put no arbitrary barriers in the way of private lending to countries with which we are at peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to peoples who are in great distress or in danger of starving . But we ought always to know clearly what we are doing . It is not wise to bestow charity on foreign peoples under the impression that // one is making a hardheaded business transaction purely for one 's own selfish purposes . That could only lead to misunderstandings and bad relations later . Yet among the arguments put forward in favor of huge foreign lending one fallacy is always sure to occupy a prominent place . It runs like this . Even if half ( or all ) the loans we make to foreign countries turn sour and are not repaid , this nation will still be better off for having made them , because they will give an enormous impetus to our exports . It should be immediately obvious that if the loans we make to foreign countries to enable them to buy our goods are not repaid , then we are giving the goods away . A nation can not grow rich by giving goods away . It can only make itself poorer . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If an automobile company lends a man $i , 000 to buy a car priced at that amount , and the loan is not repaid , the automobile company is not better off because it has " sold " the car . It has simply lost the amount that it cost to make the car . If the car cost $goo to make , and only half the loan is repaid , then the company has lost $900 minus $500 , or a net amount of $400 . It has not made up in trade what it lost in bad loans . If this proposition is so simple when applied to a private company , why do apparently intelligent people get confused about it when applied to a nation ? The reason is that the transaction must then be traced mentally through a few more stages . One group may indeed make gains ? while the rest of us take the losses . // It is true , for example , that persons engaged exclusively or chiefly in export business might gain on net balance as a result of bad loans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be certain , but it might be distributed in ways difficult to follow . The private lenders would take their losses directly . The losses from government lending would ultimately be paid out of increased taxes imposed on everybody . But there would also be many indirect losses brought about by the effect on the economy of these direct losses . In the long run business and employment in America would be hurt , not helped , by foreign loans that were not repaid . For every extra dollar that foreign buyers had with which to buy American goods , domestic buyers would ultimately have one dollar less . Businesses that depend on domestic trade would therefore be hurt in the long run as much as export businesses would be helped . Even many concerns that did an export business would be hurt on net balance . American automobile companies , for example , sold about io per cent of their output in the foreign market before the war . It would not profit them to double their sales abroad as a result of bad foreign loans if they thereby lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the result of added taxes taken from American buyers to make up for the unpaid foreign loans . None of this means , I repeat , that it is unwise to make foreign loans , but simply that we can not get rich by making bad ones . For the same reasons that it is stupid to give a false stimulation to export trade by making bad loans or outright // gifts to foreign countries , it is stupid to give a false stimulation to export trade through export subsidies . Rather than repeat most of the previous argument , I leave it to the reader to trace the effects of export subsidies as I have traced the effects of bad loans . An export subsidy is a clear case of giving the foreigner something for nothing , by selling him goods for less than it costs us to make them . It is another case of trying to get rich by giving things away . Bad loans and export subsidies are additional examples of the error of looking only at the immediate effect of a policy on special groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trace the long-run effects of the policy on everyone . C H A P T E R X I I I " PARITY " PRICES SPECIAL interests , as the history of tariffs reminds us , can think of the most ingenious reasons why they should be the objects of special solicitude . Their spokesmen present a plan in their favor ; and it seems at first so absurd that disinterested writers do not trouble to expose it . But the special interests keep on insisting on the scheme . Its enactment would make so much difference to their own immediate welfare that they can afford to hire trained economists and " public relations experts " to propagate it in their behalf . The public hears the argument so often repeated , and accompanied by such a wealth of imposing statistics , charts , curves and pie-slices , that it is soon taken in . When at last disinterested writers recognize that the danger of the scheme 's enactment is real , they are usually too late . They can not in a few weeks acquaint themselves with the subject as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full time to it for years ; they are accused of being uninformed , and they have the air of men who presume to dispute axioms . This general history will do as a history of the idea of " parity " prices for agricultural products . I forget the first day when it made its appearance in a legislative bill ; but 91 // with the advent of the New Deal in 1933 it had become a definitely established principle , enacted into law ; and as year succeeded year , and its absurd corollaries made themselves manifest , they were enacted too . The argument for " parity " prices ran roughly like this . Agriculture is the most basic and important of all industries . It must be preserved at all costs . Moreover , the prosperity of everybody else depends upon the prosperity of the farmer . If he does not have the purchasing power to buy the products of industry , industry languishes . This was the cause of the 1929 collapse , or at least of our failure to recover from it . For the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of industrial products dropped tery little . The result was that the farmer could not buy industrial products ; the city workers were laid off and could not buy farm products , and the depression spread in ever-widening vicious circles . There was only one cure , and it was simple . Bring back the prices of the farmer 's products to a " parity " with the prices of the things the farmer buys . This parity existed in the period from 1909 to 1914 , when farmers were prosperous . That price relationship must be restored and preserved perpetually . It would take too long , and carry us too far from our main point , to examine every absurdity concealed in this plausible statement . There is no sound reason for taking the particular price relationships that prevailed in a particular year or period and regarding them as sacrosanct , or even as necessarily more " normal " than those of any other period . Even if they were " normal " at the time , what // reason is there to suppose that these same relationships should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes in the conditions of production and demand that have taken place in the meantime ? The period of 1909 to 1914 , as the basis of " parity , " was not selected at random . In terms of relative prices it was one of the most favorable periods to agriculture in our entire history . If there had been any sincerity or logic in the idea , it would have been universally extended . If the price relationships between agricultural and industrial products that prevailed from August , 1909 to July , 1914 ought to be preserved perpetually , why not preserve perpetually the price relationship of every commodity at that time to every other ? A Chevrolet six-cylinder touring car cost $2,150 in 1912 ; an incomparably improved six-cylinder Chevrolet sedan cost $907 in 1942 : adjusted for " parity " on the same basis as farm products , however , it would have cost $3,270 in 1942 . A pound of aluminum from 1909 to 1913 inclusive averaged 22/ cents ; its price early in 1946 was 14 cents ; but at " parity " it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear immediate cries that such comparisons are absurd , because everybody knows not only that the present-day automobile is incomparably superior in every way to the car of 1912 , but that it costs only a fraction as much to produce , and that the same is true also of aluminum . Exactly . But why does n't somebody say something about the amazing increase in productivity per acre in agriculture ? In the five-year period 1939 to 1943 an average of 26o pounds of cotton was raised per acre in the United States as com94 ECONOMICS IN ONE LESSON pared with an average of 188 pounds in the five-year period 1909 to 1913 . Costs of production have been substantially lowered for farm products by better applications of chemical fertilizer , improved strains of seed and increasing mechanization ? by the gasoline tractor , the corn husker , the cotton picker . " On some large farms which have been completely mechanized and are operated along mass production lines , it requires only one-third to one-fifth the amount of labor to produce the same yields as it did a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the apostles of " parity " prices . The refusal to universalize the principle is not the only evidence that it is not a public-spirited economic plan but merely a device for subsidizing a special interest . Another evidence is that when agricultural prices go above " parity , " or are forced there by government policies , there is no demand on the part of the farm bloc in Congress that such prices be brought down to parity , or that the subsidy be to that extent repaid . It is a rule that works only one way . 2 Dismissing all these considerations , let us return to the central fallacy that specially concerns us here . This is the argument that if the fainter gets higher prices for his products he can buy more goods from industry and so make industry prosperous and bring full employment . It does not matter to this argument , of course , whether or not the farmer gets specifically so-called " parity " prices . Footnote // Everything , however , depends on how these higher prices are brought about . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they follow from increased prosperity of business , increased industrial production and increased purchasing power of city workers ( not brought about by inflation ) , then they can indeed mean increased prosperity and pro-duction not only for the fanners , but for everyone . But what we are discussing is a rise in farm prices brought about by government intervention . This can be done in several ways . The higher price can be forced by mere edict , which is the least workable method . It can be brought about by the government 's standing ready to buy all the farm products offered to it at the " parity " price . It can be brought about by the government 's lending to farmers enough money on their crops to enable them to hold the crops off the market until " parity " or a higher price is realized . It can be brought about by the government 's en-forcing restrictions in the size of crops . It can be brought about , as it often is in practice , by a combination of these methods . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ method , it is in any case brought about . What is the result ? The farmers get higher prices for their crops . Their " purchasing power " is thereby increased . They are for the time being more prosperous themselves , and they buy more of the products of industry . All this is what is seen by those who look merely at the immediate consequences of policies to the groups directly involved . But there is another consequence , no less inevitable . Suppose the wheat which would otherwise sell at $I a // bushel is pushed up by this policy to $ I.50 . The farmer gets 50 cents a bushel more for wheat . But the city worker , by precisely the same change , pays 50 cents a bushel more for wheat in an increased price of bread . The same thing is true of any other farm product . If the farmer then has 50 cents more purchasing power to buy industrial products , the city worker has precisely that much less purchasing power to buy industrial products . On net balance industry in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precisely as much as it gains in rural sales . There is of course a change in the incidence of these sales . No doubt the agricultural-implement makers and the mail-order houses do a better business . But the city department stores do a smaller business . The matter , however , does not end here . The policy results not merely in no net gain , but in a net loss . For it does not mean merely a transfer of purchasing power to the farmer from city consumers , or from the general taxpayer , or from both . It also means a forced cut in the production of farm commodities to bring up the price . This means a destruction of wealth . It means that there is less food to be consumed . How this destruction of wealth is brought about will depend upon the particular method pursued to bring prices up . It may mean the actual physical destruction of what has already been produced , as in the burning of coffee in Brazil . It may mean a forced restriction of acreage , as in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some of these methods when we come to the broader discussion of government commodity controls . // But here it may be pointed out that when the farmer reduces the production of wheat to get " parity , " he may indeed get a higher price for each bushel , but he produces and sells fewer bushels . The result is that his income does not go up in proportion to his prices . Even some of the advocates of " parity prices " recognize this , and use it as an argument to go on to insist upon " parity income " for farmers . But this can only be achieved by a subsidy at the direct expense of taxpayers . To help the farmers , in other words , it merely reduces the purchasing power of city workers and other groups still more . 3 There is one argument for " parity " prices that should be dealt with before we leave the subject . It is put forward by some of the more sophisticated defenders . " Yes , " they will freely admit , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a special privilege . They are an imposition on the consumer . But is n't the tariff an imposition on the farmer ? Does n't he have to pay higher prices on industrial products because of it ? It would do no good to place a compensating tariff on farm products , because America is a net exporter of farm products . Now the parity-price system is the farmer 's equivalent of the tariff . It is the only fair way to even things up . " The farmers that asked for parity prices did have a legitimate complaint . The protective tariff injured them more than they knew . By reducing industrial imports it // also reduced American farm exports , because it prevented foreign nations from getting the dollar exchange needed for taking our agricultural products . And it provoked retaliatory tariffs in other countries . None the less , the argument we have just quoted will not stand examination . It is wrong even in its implied statement of the facts . There is no general tariff on all " industrial " products or on all nonfarm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exporting industries that have no tariff protection . If the city worker has to pay a higher price for woolen blankets or overcoats because of a tariff , is he " compensated " by having to pay a higher price also for cotton clothing and for foodstuffs ? Or is he merely being robbed twice ? Let us even it all out , say some , by giving equal " protection " to everybody . But that is insoluble and impossible . Even if we assume that the problem could be solved technically ? a tariff for A , an industrialist subject to foreign competition ; a subsidy for B , an industrialist who exports his product ? it would be impossible to protect or to subsidize everybody " fairly " or equally . We should have to give everyone the same percentage ( or would it be the same dollar amount ? ) of tariff protection or subsidy , and we could never be sure when we were duplicating payments to some groups or leaving gaps with others . But suppose we could solve this fantastic problem ? What would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone else ? What is the profit when everyone loses in added taxes precisely what he gains by his subsidy or his protection ? We should merely have added " PARITY " PRICES 99 ' an army of needless bureaucrats to carry out the program , with all of them lost to production . We could solve the matter simply , on the other hand , by ending both the parity-price system and the protectivetariff system . Meanwhile they do not , in combination , even out anything . The joint system means merely that Farmer A and Industrialist B both profit at the expense of Forgotten Man C. So the alleged benefits of still another scheme evaporate as soon as we trace not only its immediate effects on a special group but its long-run effects on everyone . C H A P T E R X I V SAVING THE X INDUSTRY HE lobbies of Congress are crowded with representatives of the X industry . The X industry is sick . The X industry is dying . It must be saved . It can be saved only by a tariff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If it is allowed to die , workers will be thrown on the streets . Their landlords , grocers , butchers , clothing stores and local motion picture theaters will lose business , and depression will spread in ever-widening circles . But if the X industry , by prompt action of Congress , is saved ? ah then ! it will buy equipment from other industries ; more men will be employed ; they will give more business to the butchers , bakers and neon-light makers , and then it is prosperity that will spread in ever-widening circles . It is obvious that this is merely a generalized form of the case we have just been considering . There the X industry was agriculture . But there are an endless number of X industries . Two of the most notable examples in recent years have been the coal and silver industries . To " save silver " Congress did immense harm . One of the arguments for the rescue plan was that it would help " the East . " One of its actual results was to cause deflation in China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to force I00 SAVING THE X INDUSTRY IoI China off that basis . The United States Treasury was compelled to acquire , at ridiculous prices far above the market level , hoards of unnecessary silver , and to store it in vaults . The essential political aims of the " silver Sena-tors " could have been as well achieved , at a fraction of the harm and cost , by the payment of a frank subsidy to the mine owners or to their workers ; but Congress and the country would never have approved a naked steal of this sort unaccompanied by the ideological flim-flaw regard-ing " silver 's essential role in the national currency . " To save the coal industry Congress passed the Gulley Act , under which the owners of coal mines were not only permitted , but compelled , to conspire together not to sell below certain minimum prices fixed by the government . Though Congress had started out to fix " the " price of coal , the government soon found itself ( because of dif-ferent sizes , thousands of mines , and shipments to thou-sands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barge ) fixing 350,000 separate prices for coal ! 1 One effect of this attempt to keep coal prices above the competi-tive market level was to accelerate the tendency toward the substitution by consumers of other sources of power or heat ? such as oil , natural gas and hydro-electric energy . // IN ONE LESSON lowed historically from efforts to save particular industries , but to trace a few of the chief results that must necessarily follow from efforts to save an industry . It may be argued that a given industry must be created or preserved for military reasons . It may be argued that a given industry is being ruined by taxes or wage rates disproportionate to those of other industries ; or that , if a public utility , it is being forced to operate at rates or charges to the public that do not permit an adequate profit margin . Such arguments may or may not be justified in a particular case . We are not concerned with them here . We are concerned only with a single argument for saving the X industry ? that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the forces of free competition ( always , by spokesmen for the industry , designated in such cases as a laissezfaire , anarchic , cutthroat , dog-eat-dog , law-of-the-jungle competition ) it will pull down the general economy with it , and that if it is artificially kept alive it will help everybody else . What we are talking about here is nothing else but a generalized case of the argument put forward for " parity " prices for farm products or for tariff protection for any number of X industries . The argument against artificially higher prices applies , of course , not only to farm products but to any other product , just as the reasons we have found for opposing tariff protection for one industry apply to any other . But there are always any number of schemes for saving X industries . There are two main types of such proposals // in addition to those we have already considered , and we shall take a brief glance at them . One is to contend that the X industry is already " overcrowded , " and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . The other is to argue that the X industry needs to be supported by a direct subsidy from the government . Now if the X industry is really overcrowded as corn ' pared with other industries it will not need any coercive legislation to keep out new capital or new workers . New capital does not rush into industries that are obviously dying . Investors do not eagerly seek the industries that present the highest risks of loss combined with the lowest returns . Nor do workers , when they have any better alternative , go into industries where the wages are lowest and the prospects for steady employment least promising . If new capital and new labor are forcibly kept out of the X industry , however , either by monopolies , cartels , union policy or legislation , it deprives this capital and labor of liberty of choice . It forces investors to place their money where the returns seem less promising to them than in the X industry . It forces workers into industries with even lower wages and prospects than they could find in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that both capital and labor are less efficiently employed than they would be if they were permitted to make their own free choices . It means , therefore , a lowering of production which must reflect itself in a lower average living standard . That lower living standard will be brought about either by lower average money wages than would otherwise preIOC ECONOMICS IN ONE LESSON vail or by higher average living costs , or by a combination of both . ( The exact result would depend upon the accompanying monetary policy . ) By these restrictive policies wages and capital returns might indeed be kept higher than otherwise within the X industry itself ; but wages and capital returns in other industries would be forced down lower than otherwise . The X industry would benefit only at the expense of the A , B and C industries . 3 Similar results would follow any attempt to save the X industry by a direct subsidy out of the public till . This would be nothing more than a transfer of wealth or income to the X industry . The taxpayers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ X industry gained . The great advantage of a subsidy , indeed , from the standpoint of the public , is that it makes this fact so clear . There is far less opportunity for the intellectual obfuscation that accompanies arguments for tariffs , minimum-price fixing or monopolistic exclusion . It is obvious in the case of a subsidy that the taxpayers must lose precisely as much as the X industry gains . It should be equally clear that , as a consequence , other industries must lose what the X industry gains . They must pay part of the taxes that are used to support the X industry . And consumers , because they are taxed to support the X industry , will have that much less income left with // which to buy other things . The result must be that other industries on the average must be smaller than otherwise in order that the X industry may be larger . But the result of this subsidy is not merely that there has been a transfer of wealth or income , or that other industries have shrunk in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The result is also ( and this is where the net loss comes in to the nation considered as a unit ) that capital and labor are driven out of industries in which they are more efficiently employed to be diverted to an industry in which they are less efficiently employed . Less wealth is created . The average standard of living is lowered compared with what it would have been . 4 These results are virtually inherent , in fact , in the very arguments put forward to subsidize the X industry . The X industry is shrinking or dying by the contention of its friends . Why , it may be asked , should it be kept alive by artificial respiration ? The idea that an expanding economy implies that all industries must be simultaneously expanding is a profound error . In order that new industries may grow fast enough it is necessary that some old industries should be allowed to shrink or die . They must do this in order to release the necessary capital and labor for the new industries . If we had tried to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the growth of the automobile industry and all the trades deIo6 ECONOMICS IN ONE LESSON pendent on it . We should have lowered the production of wealth and retarded economic and scientific progress . We do the same thing , however , when we try to prevent any industry from dying in order to protect the labor already trained or the capital already invested in it . Paradoxical as it may seem to some , it is just as necessary to the health of a dynamic economy that dying industries be allowed to die as that growing industries be allowed to grow . The first process is essential to the second . It is as foolish to try to preserve obsolescent industries as to try to preserve obsolescent methods of production : this is often , in fact , merely two ways of describing the same thing . Improved methods of production must constantly supplant obsolete methods , if both old needs and new wants are to be filled by better commodities and better means . CHAPTER SV HOW THE PRICE SYSTEM WORKS THE whole argument of this book may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any given economic proposal we must trace not merely the immediate results but the results in the long run , not merely the primary consequences but the secondary consequences , and not merely the effects on some special group but the effects on everyone . It follows that it is foolish and misleading to concentrate our attention merely on some special point ? to examine , for example , merely what happens in one industry without considering what happens in all . But it is precisely from the persistent and lazy habit of thinking only of some particular industry or process in isolation that the major fallacies of economics stem . These fallacies pervade not merely the arguments of the hired spokesmen of special interests , but the arguments even of some economists who pass as profound . It is on the fallacy of isolation , at bottom , that the " **37;238;TOOLONG " school is based , with its attack on the allegedly vicious " price system . " The problem of production , say the adherents of this school , is solved . ( This resounding error , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I08 ECONOMICS IN ONE LESSON point of most currency cranks and share-the-wealth charlatans . ) The problem of production is solved . The scientists , the efficiency experts , the engineers , the technicians , have solved it . They could turn out almost anything you cared to mention in huge and practically unlimited amounts . But , alas , the world is not ruled by the engineers , thinking only of production , but by the business men , thinking only of profit . The business men give their orders to the engineers , instead of vice versa . These business men will turn out any object as long as there is a profit in doing so , but the moment there is no longer a profit in making that article , the wicked business men will stop making it , though many people 's wants are unsatisfied , and the world is crying for more goods . There are so many fallacies in this view that they can not all be disentangled at once . But the central error , as we have hinted , comes from looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn , as if each of them existed in isolation . Each of them in fact exists in relation to all the others , and every important decision made in it is affected by and affects the decisions made in all the others . We can understand this better if we understand the basic problem that business collectively has to solve . To simplify this as much as possible , let us consider the problem that confronts a Robinson Crusoe on his desert island . His wants at first seem endless . He is soaked with rain ; he shivers from cold ; he suffers from hunger and thirst . He needs everything : drinking water , food , a roof over his head , protection from animals , a fire , a soft place to lie // down . It is impossible for him to satisfy all these needs at once ; he has not the time , energy or resources . He must attend immediately to the most pressing need . He suffers most , say , from thirst . He hollows out a place in the sand to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When he has provided for only a small water supply , however , he must turn to finding food before he tries to improve this . He can try to fish ; but to do this he needs either a hook and line , or a net , and he must set to work on these . But everything he does delays or prevents him from doing something else only a little less urgent . He is faced constantly by the problem of alternative applications of his time and labor . A Swiss Family Robinson , perhaps , finds this problem a little easier to solve . It has more mouths to feed , but it also has more hands to work for them . It can practice division and specialization of labor . The father hunts ; the mother prepares the food ; the children collect firewood . But even the family can not afford to have one member of it doing endlessly the same thing , regardless of the relative urgency of the common need he supplies and the urgency of other needs still unfilled . When the children have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be used simply to increase the pile . It is soon time for one of them to be sent , say , for more water . The family too has the constant problem of choosing among alternative applications of labor , and , if it is lucky enough to have acquired guns , fishing tackle , a boat , axes , saws and so on , of choosing among alternative applications of labor and capital . It would be IIo ECONOMICS IN ONE LESSON considered unspeakably silly for the wood-gathering member of the family to complain that they could gather more firewood if his brother helped him all day , instead of getting the fish that were needed for the family dinner . It is recognized clearly in the case of an isolated individual or family that one occupation can expand only at the expense of all other occupations . Elementary illustrations like this are sometimes ridiculed as " Crusoe economics . " Unfortunately , they are ridiculed most by those who most need them , who fail to understand the particular principle illustrated even in this simple form , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to examine the bewildering complications of a great modern economic society . 2 Let us now turn to such a society . How is the problem of alternative applications of labor and capital , to meet thousands of different needs and wants of different urgencies , solved in such a.society ? It is solved precisely through the price system . It is solved through the constantly changing interrelationships of costs of production , prices and profits . Prices are fixed through the relationship of supply and demand , and in turn affect supply and demand . When people want more of an article , they offer more for it . The price goes up . This increases the profits of those who make the article . Because it is now more profitable to make that HOW THE PRICE SYSTEM WORKS III article than others , the people already in the business expand their production of it , and more people are attracted to the business . This increased supply then reduces the price and reduces the profit margin , until the profit margin on that article once more falls to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other industries . Or the demand for that article may fall ; or the supply of it may be increased to such a point that its price drops to a level where there is less profit in making it than in making other articles ; or perhaps there is an actual loss in making it . In this case the " marginal " producers , that is , the producers who are least efficient , or whose costs of production are highest , will be driven out of business altogether . The product will now be made only by the more efficient producers who operate on lower costs . The supply of that commodity will also drop , or will at least cease to expand . This process is the origin of the belief that prices are determined by costs of production . The doctrine , stated in this form , is not true . Prices are determined by supply and demand , and demand is determined by how intensely people want a commodity and what they have to offer in exchange for it . It is true that supply is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commodity has cost to produce in the past can not determine its value . That will depend on the present relationship of supply and demand . But the expectations of business men concerning what a commodity will cost to produce in the future , and what its future price will be , will determine how much of it will be made . This will affect future supply . There is therefore a 1I2 ECONOMICS IN ONE LESSON constant tendency for the price of a commodity and its marginal cost of production to equal each other , but not because that marginal cost of production directly determines the price . The private enterprise system , then , might be compared to thousands of machines , each regulated by its own quasiautomatic governor , yet with these machines and their governors all interconnected and influencing each other , so that they act in effect like one great machine . Most of us must have noticed the automatic " governor " on a steam engine . It usually consists of two balls or weights which work by centrifugal force . As the speed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rod to which they are attached and so automatically narrow or close off a throttle valve which regulates the intake of steam and thus slows down the engine . If the engine goes too slowly , on the other hand , the balls drop , widen the throttle valve , and increase the engine 's speed . Thus every departure from the desired speed itself sets in motion the forces that tend to correct that departure . It is precisely in this way that the relative supply of thousands of different commodities is regulated under the system of competitive private enterprise . When people want more of a commodity , their competitive bidding raises its price . This increases the profits of the producers who make that product . This stimulates them to increase their production . It leads others to stop making some of the products they previously made , and turn to making the product that offers them the better return . But this increases the supply // of that commodity at the same time that it reduces the supply of some other commodities . The price of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products , and the stimulus to the relative increase in its production disappears . In the same way , if the demand falls off for some product , its price and the profit in making it go lower , and its production declines . It is this last development that scandalizes those who do not understand the " price system " they denounce . They accuse it of creating scarcity . Why , they ask indignantly , should manufacturers cut off the production of shoes at the point where it becomes unprofitable to produce any more ? Why should they be guided merely by their own profits ? Why should they be guided by the market ? Why do they not produce shoes to the " full capacity of modem technical processes " ? The price system and private enterprise , conclude the " production-for-use " philosophers , are merely a form of " scarcity economics . " These questions and conclusions stem from the fallacy of looking at one industry in isolation , of looking at the tree and ignoring the forest . Up to a certain point it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to produce coats , shirts , trousers , homes , plows , shovels , factories , bridges , milk and bread . It would be idiotic to go on piling up mountains of surplus shoes , simply because we could do it , while hundreds of more urgent needs went unfilled . Now in an economy in equilibrium , a given industry I14 ECONOMICS IN ONE LESSON can expand only at the expense of other industries . For at any moment the factors of production are limited . One industry can be expanded only by diverting to it labor , land and capital that would otherwise be employed in other industries . And when a given industry shrinks , or stops expanding its output , it does not necessarily mean that there has been any net decline in aggregate production . The shrinkage at that point may have merely released labor and capital to permit the expansion of other industries . It is erroneous to conclude , therefore , that a shrinkage of production in one line necessarily means a shrinkage in total production . Everything , in short , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of production themselves , in fact , might be defined as the things that are given up ( the leisure and pleasures , the raw materials with alternative potential uses ) in order to create the thing that is made . It follows that it is just as essential for the health of a dynamic economy that dying industries should be allowed to die as that growing industries should be allowed to grow . For the dying industries absorb labor and capital that should be released for the growing industries . It is only the much vilified price system that solves the enormously complicated problem of deciding precisely how much of tens of thousands of different commodities and services should be produced in relation to each other . These otherwise bewildering equations are solved quasi-automatically by the system of prices , profits and costs . They are solved by this system incomparably better than any group of bureaucrats could // solve them . For they are solved by a system under which each consumer makes his own demand and casts a fresh vote , or a dozen fresh votes , every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having made for the consumers , not what the consumers themselves wanted , but what the bureaucrats decided was good for them . Yet though the bureaucrats do not understand the quasiautomatic system of the market , they are always disturbed by it . They are always trying to improve it or correct it , usually in the interests of some wailing pressure group . What some of the results of their intervention is , we shall examine in succeeding chapters . C H A P T E R X V I " STABILIZING " COMMODI'T'IES i'Emp-rs to lift the prices of particular commodities permanently above their natural market levels have failed so often , so disastrously and so notoriously that sophisticated pressure groups , and the bureaucrats upon whom they apply the pressure , seldom openly avow that aim . Their stated aims , particularly when they are first proposing that the government intervene , are usually more modest , and more plausible . They have no wish , they declare , to raise the price of commodity X permanently above its natural level . That , they concede , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obviously selling far below its natural level . The producers can not make a living . Unless we act promptly , they will be thrown out of business . Then there will be a real scarcity , and consumers will have to pay exorbitant prices for the commodity . The apparent bargains that the consumers are now getting will cost them dear in the end . For the present " temporary " low price can not last . But we can not afford to wait for so-called natural market forces , or for the " blind " law of supply and demand , to correct the situation . For by that time the producers will be ruined and a great scarcity will be upon us . The government must I16 STABILIZING COMMODITIES II , act . All that we really want to do is to correct these violent , senseless fluctuations in price . We are not trying to boost the price ; we are only trying to stabilize it . There are several methods by which it is commonly proposed to do this . One of the most frequent is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crops off the market . Such loans are urged . in Congress for reasons that seem very plausible to most listeners . They are told that the farmers ' crops are all dumped on the market at once , at harvest time ; that this is precisely the time when prices are lowest , and that speculators take advantage of this to buy the crops themselves and hold them for higher prices when food gets scarcer again . Thus it is urged that the farmers suffer , and that they , rather than the speculators , should get the advantage of the higher average price . This argument is not supported by either theory or experience . The much-reviled speculators are not the enemy of the farmer ; they are essential to his best welfare . The risks of fluctuating farm prices must be borne by somebody ; they have in fact been borne in modern times chiefly by the professional speculators . In general , the more competently the latter act in their own interest as speculators , the more they help the farmer . For speculators serve their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices . But the more accurately they foresee future prices the less violent or extreme are the fluctuations in prices . Even if farmers had to dump their whole crop of wheat on the market in a single month of the year , therefore , I18 ECONOMICS IN ONE LESSON the price in that month would not necessarily be below the price at any other month ( apart from an allowance for the costs of storage ) . For speculators , in the hope of making a profit , would do most of their buying at that time . They would keep on buying until the price rose to a point where they saw no further opportunity of future profit . They would sell whenever they thought there was a prospect of future loss . The result would be to stabilize the price of farm commodities the year round . It is precisely because a professional class of speculators exists to take these risks that farmers and millers do not need to take them . The latter can protect themselves through the markets . Linder normal conditions , therefore , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmers and millers will depend chiefly on their skill and industry in farming or milling , and not on market fluctuations . Actual experience shows that on the average the price of wheat and other non-perishable crops remains the same all year round except for an allowance for storage and insurance charges . In fact , some careful investigations have shown that the average monthly rise after harvest time has not been quite sufficient to pay such storage charges , so that the speculators have actually subsidized the fanners . This , of course , was not their intention : it has simply been the result of a persistent tendency to over-optimism on the part of speculators . ( This tendency seems to affect entrepreneurs in most competitive pursuits : as a class they are constantly , contrary to intention , subsidizing consumers . it // This is particularly true wherever the prospects of big speculative gains exist .
