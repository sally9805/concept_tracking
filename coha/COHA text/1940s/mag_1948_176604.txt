In Israel recently an American ex-Army captain tried to marry a Jewess . A rabbi refused to officiate ( because the captain was not a Jew ) ; ditto a district commissioner ( because he was not a British subject ) . He was turned down by an Anglican church in Jaffa ( because the bride was not a Christian ) and by a Greek Orthodox priest ( who considered both outside his flock ) . A ship captain said he could perform the ceremony by taking them on a special trip beyond the three-mile limit . But when he quoted his price , the couple decided it would be cheaper to fly to Europe and be married there . <P> Last week many influential Israelis were demanding civil marriage for Israel , which now operates under a rule taken over from the British , who decided that only rabbis could perform Jewish marriages in Palestine . Israel 's Minister of Religion , aged ( 72 ) , Judah L. Fishman , set out the counter-demands of the religious groups : enforcement of the Sabbath , adoption of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and government observance of dietary laws . Said he : " I do n't expect to go looking into the cook pots of all the housewives of Israel , but state institutions should have kosher kitchens . " He felt that the new state should " have the stamp of Judaism upon it . " <P> Leading the secularist opposition was the United Workers Party ( Israel 's second largest ) which insists on complete separation of church and state . The United Workers last week charged the government with " a design to force religion on the soldiers " by closing army kitchens on Yom Kippur , providing only bread and jam to " thousands of soldiers who did not want to fast . " Other secularists demanded a government investigation of an army commander who ( they said ) had marched 600 soldiers to a synagogue . <P> Religious Jews were also calling for an official investigation . Two orthodox Jews , cooks in the army , had been sentenced to three months in jail and had had their heads shaved when they refused an order to cook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but could do nothing about the sidecurls , particularly precious to orthodox Jews. * ) Even Rabbi Fishman , who had been protesting the official use of government cars on the Sabbath , had a complaint to make . His own official automobile-with " Minister of Religion " printed prominently on the windshield-had been seen on the Sabbath cruising about the streets of Tel Aviv . <P> * Orthodox concern for sidecurls starts with Leviticus , 19:27 : " Ye shall not round the corners of your heads , neither shalt thou mar the corners of thy beard . " The Talmud carefully enumerates the corners : two on each cheek , one on the chin . Yemenite Jews often shave their heads , but leave the sidecurls ( peoth ) untouched .
