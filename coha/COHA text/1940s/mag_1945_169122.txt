To its four-man Board of Control Toronto elected a man who two years ago was an outlaw . After Canada outlawed the Communist Party , in June 1940 , Communist Stewart Smith , 37 , hid from the police for two years . Later he surrendered , was held two weeks in jail , then released . Last week , still a communist , he moved into an office in Toronto 's City Hall . <P> In the municipal election , Smith polled 41,000 votes to run third in an eight-candidate field . For a city generally considered a conservative stronghold , this was a remarkable showing . Torontonians also elected two communist aldermen , defeated six others . The socialist CCF failed to elect its five candidates for alderman . <P> Most of Smith 's votes probably came from noncommunist union members and from plain citizens who believed that he would be a smart , efficient official . Smith , no stranger to City Hall , where he served as alderman in 1937 , was expected to play down revolution , play up municipal reform .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
