Early in the afternoon of Sabbath eve two British minesweepers spotted their quarry entering Palestine 's territorial waters near Haifa . She was a battered , 750-ton freighter jampacked with 1,350 Jewish refugees from Europe bent on entering the Holy Land . She had had a long , hard voyage-30 days from Goteborg , Sweden , which she had cleared as a Greek ship ( the Ulua ) , bound for South America . Now she flew the blue-and-white Zionist flag and her bridge carried a freshly painted name : Chaim Arlosoroff ( in honor of a murdered Palestine labor leader ) . <P> The minesweepers closed in , radioing their position to shore stations and to a nearby group of destroyers . From the rail of the Arlosoroff the immigrants shouted taunts as 13 British sailors drew up alongside and swung aboard . The sailors met a wall of wild-eyed men &; women , most of them young and strong . Disregarding the sailors ' guns and tear-gas grenades the Jews waded in , overpowered the British sailors , flung them into the sea . <P> Soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broke out as the immigrants refused to permit the British Navy to take over . While passengers clawed and pummeled the sailors , the ship zigzagged through converging Navy craft . Finally the Arlosoroff scraped aground , just 100 yards off Bat Galim , Haifa 's seashore suburb . Behind the barbed wire on the beach , hundreds of Jews waved handkerchiefs at the immigrants , cheered as a dozen leaped overboard and struggled ashore-to certain capture . On the ship the fight continued . <P> The news spread to Haifa . Thousands stopped work and swarmed angrily toward Bat Galim . They passed Barclay 's Bank Building , shattered by a bomb soon after the ship 's interception ( two Jews were killed ) . Then they ran into tough , maroon-bereted British paratroopers , who barred their way . Jews and soldiers traded insults . Then the Jews went away into the dusk of Sabbath eve . Four hours after the first encounter aboard the Arlosoroff the fight went out of the immigrants on the ship . <P> Death in the Afternoon . The Sabbath in Jerusalem was clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lunched at Goldsmith House , the three-story officers ' club on King George Avenue . Afterwards , half a dozen went to the roof for sun baths ; some retired for siestas . The rest left . Sir Henry Gurney , Chief Secretary of the Palestine Government , kept a golf date . <P> Midafternoon , the two sentries patrolling the entry through the barbed wire to Goldsmith House were startled by a small explosion in the rear of the building . Then bullets whizzed around them . One soldier fell , dead . A truck rumbled through the wire opening . Covered by a spray of machine gun and rifle fire from nearby buildings , three men dashed to the truck . Out of it and into the club 's door and open windows they heaved suitcases . In a moment there was a heavy explosion . Hours later , when the rubble had been combed , the British announced the toll : 16 killed , 14 injured . Among the dead were eight Arab employees , one British civilian , one British officer .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
