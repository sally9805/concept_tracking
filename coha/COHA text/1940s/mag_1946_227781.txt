Big Ed Pauley , former treasurer of the Democratic National Committee , numbers among his many interests a substantial holding in California 's tidelands oil. * Last week , at the Senate Naval Affairs Committee hearings on Pauley 's much-criticized appointment as Under Secretary of the Navy , tidelands oil was the subject of some revealing testimony . <P> Senator Tobey : Did you ever tell Mr. Ickes that the filing of the Government test suit would be a political mistake-get this carefully , please-and that if you could assure California oilmen that the suit would not be filed , you could raise several hundred thousand dollars from them in campaign contributions ? <P> Pauley : I did not , I did not ! <P> Next day Interior Secretary Harold Ickes was in the witness chair . <P> Tobey : Mr. Pauley has stated under oath that he had done nothing to stop the filing of that suit . Did Mr. Pauley . . . ever tell you that the filing of that Government suit would be bad politically , that several hundred thousand dollars could be raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suit would not be filed ? <P> Ickes : This inquiry is highly embarrassing to me but you have the right to ask the question . . . . My answer is yes . <P> Tobey : Was Mr. Pauley telling the truth when he stated that he never sought to stop the test suit ? <P> Ickes : I will have to say that I do n't <P> think that was an accurate statement . <P> Dates &; Places . Appointee Pauley was asked : Had he ever spoken to Franklin Roosevelt or ex-Attorney General Francis Biddle about the suit ? Had he ever tried to influence anyone at any time regarding the suit ? His reply : No , he had not . <P> Next day Senator Tobey produced Norman Littell , a former assistant to Biddle . Littell came armed with notes , going back to 1940 and 1941 , which he had kept because he " knew there was going to be trouble . " He read from them the places , dates and hours of conferences between Pauley , Biddle and himself . <P> At one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bill passed or the suit called off definitely , or both . " Once Littell had accepted an invitation to have a drink at Pauley 's suite in a Manhattan hotel . There , he said , Pauley told him : " Norm , you know I have raised money for the campaign . A lot of that money came from people interested in the tidelands . In my room waiting to see you is Harry March , vice president of Signal Oil &; Gas Co . ... These people have contributed to the campaign and they expect something for their money . " <P> Senator Tobey asked : Did Littell know that Pauley had testified that he had never talked to Franklin Roosevelt or Francis Biddle on the subject ? Replied Littell : " If he said that , I am afraid it is not true . " <P> At week 's end Senator Tobey looked over the transcript , said that it would how six instances in which Oilman Pauley 's testimony had been disputed by other witnesses . Said the Senator : " I hope that all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under oath . " <P> <P> * Petroleum deposits lying between the ocean 's low-tide mark and the three-mile limit . For several years control of tidelands oil has been a hot federal-state controversy . A federal suit to obtain title is pending in the Supreme Court ; a bill to give title to the states is pending in the Senate .
