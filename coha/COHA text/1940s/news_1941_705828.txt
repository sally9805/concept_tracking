txt With 97 per cent of the regular force ready and eager to return to work this morning , operation of the Federal Shipbuilding and Drydock Company yards here resumed to ' day under government operation . As the movement of a giant crane at the south end of the vast plant symbolized tile resumption of work on , $493,000,000 in defense contracts , Rear Admiral H. G. Bowen , assigned by Secretary of the Navy Knox to " take over " in accordance with the order of President Roosevelt , expressed satisfaction at the way things were shaping up under the new set-up . " I 've been through the shops , " he reported , " and everybody 's hitting the ball . Everything 's going nicely . The people are working not only willingly but enthusiastically . " Union Leader Pleased While he was speaking John Green , Scottish-born president of the Industrial Union of Marine and Shipbuilding Workers of America , C. I. 0. , phoned to authorize the admiral to announce that the union was " delighted " with the situation . L. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be in his office in the same building , but would not see reporters . Admiral Bowen said Mr. Korndorff 's offer last night to turn over to the government all of the physical assets of the plant or its entire capital stock  --  compensation to be determined later  --  was strictly a matter for Secretary Knox arid pending word from the Secretary the admiral could take no official cognizance of it . On a few other points the admiral ? in general thoroughly frank and genial  --  remained noncommittal . He would not discuss any aspect of the company stockholders ' interest in the matter , save to remark that he was " not a financial man , " but was sure " the government wo n't get stuck . " Nor would he discuss the moot " maintenance of membership " clause that was the core of the dispute which led to the strike , which began at midnight three weeks ago tomorrow . Membership Issue Undecided In Washington President Roosevelt said that it had not been decided yet whether the commandeered plant would require union " maintenance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mediation Board . It will depend on who operates the plant , the President said , responding to a question whether the Mediation Board 's recommendations would be followed . President Roosevelt conferred // with Secretary Knox and Attorney General-Designate Francis J. Biddle and told his press conference that they had explored various possibilities for government operation of the plant . He said that Secretary Knox and Mr. Biddle would have further conversations and would report back to him . What happened in effect , therefore , was that 10,889 men went back to work this morning with nothing but the assurance of their own leaders that the point for which they had struck had been decided in their favor . Mr. Green , however , reached later in Camden , had no doubts . He conceded that there was nothing in writing between the government and the union as to the application of the " maintenance of membership " principle under government operation . " We have no written assurance , " he said , " other than we know the condition that was laid down . " But he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on July 26 , whereby the company was urged to accept the modified union shop involved in " maintenance of membership . " And when the government took over , he held , it was understood that this recommendation , rejected by the company , would he adopted . The phrase , " maintenance of membership , " is generally taken to mean that non-union workers can not be compelled to join the union , but that all present or future members must keep in good standing on penalty of their jobs . It has been pointed out that such a clause in an understanding between government and union would not be unprecedented . The arrangement between the Panama Railroad Steamship Company , a War Department agency , and the National Maritime Union , C. I. 0. , provides an even more nearly closed shop than the " maintenance of membership " arrangement . Little Excitement at Plant There was little excitement or fanfare as the unionists came back to work . " Demonstrations " of enthusiasm were largely pre-arranged by photographers . But it was plain that all the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines . They enjoyed the repeated blasts of the 7:30 whistle . Hudson County and Kearny township policemen had little to do but keep a routine watch on the heavy traffic past the plant . The only new experience awaiting the workers was to change their usual circular identification buttons for a new oval type . Admiral Bowen said the company had planned to change the buttons regardless of the strike outcome . The admiral added that the delay involved in the button-changing in about 150 cases would be on government time , not on the men 's own . Flanked by Daniel S. Ring , his industrial relations adviser , and other aides , Admiral Bowen declared at the outset that " the most interesting piece ? of news this morning " lay in the figures . On Tuesday , Aug. 5 , he said , 11,160 men reported to work at 7:30 A. M. This morning , 10,889 appeared . Similarly official figures were unavailable for the shift which reported at 4:30 P. M. , but competent observers estimated that 3,500 men reported at that time and felt that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out that in the case of North American Aviation , taken over by the government under sharply contrasting conditions , the first day 's return was about 80 per cent and it was " several days before it was up above 95 per cent . " With regard to the line-up of non-regular employes outside the plant , looking for work , the admiral quoted James H. Love , personnel manager of the company , as saying it was about normal . Policemen outside said the line had included 2,500 men at one time and was above normal . It appeared to be moving slowly . Asked if the yard would try to make up lost time , Admiral Bowen said , " We 'll try to . " After a check with aides , he said there were at present six . destroyers , - two cruisers , three tankers and two C-2 ( cargo ) vessels on the ways . He could not set a date for the launching of the Atlanta , one of the cruisers , believed virtually ready to take the plunge . The government plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . Payment will be made in cash on the Friday following the work-week ended Monday , There will be some carryover company payments this Friday , he added , but the regular government pay day would not come until a week later . He hoped the workers would realize that because " you know how some Americans are , they spend it before they get it and I do n't want the boys to spend it if they are n't going to get it . " It was indicated that eventually the $750,000 payroll might be settled by checks , but the admiral explained that would require considerable administrative groundwork . Asked to say exactly how he had taken over , he smiled , " We just took . " He referred to notices posted throughout the grounds declaring " * * * Pursuant to the executive order of the President , the undersigned has been designated to take possession of this plant and such possession has this day been taken . " Copies of the order itself also were posted . He said he had " naturally " questioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It was simply ' business as usual , ' " he said . " The men were  --  pardon my frankness  --  damn glad to get back to work . " Avoids Ownership Issue Summing up , Admiral Bowen made plain he could not be " drawn into " any discussion of government ownership as such . The Navy had a job to do in the plant ; " We 're going to run it and we 'll run it , " he concluded , " and I have all the confidence in the world that the Navy is going to do a good job . " He listed as comprising his staff only the following : Commander 0 . D. Foutch of the Navy 's Supply Corps ; Lieut . Comdr . G. A. Holderness , aide : Mr. Ring ; John Vincent of the office of the Under-Secretary of the Navy , legal adviser ; Norman P. Cassidy and F. W.
