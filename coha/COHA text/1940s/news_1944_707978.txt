txt In a move to divert labor to other fields , the War Manpower Commission today ordered hotels to slash their services and slapped restrictions on their employment of men under 45 . The rules contemplate for the hotel guest : One bath a day or use a towel still damp from the first clean-up . Use of the same sheets at least half a week if you stay that long . And maybe even handle your own baggage or wait for it to be handled by women , elderly men , or physically handicapped bellboys . Hotels designated as " locally needed " were instructed to substitute women , the elderly or the handicapped for able-bodied males under 45 serving as elevator operatom , bellhops , doormen and front , office workers unless they can show that such adjustments are not possible . Hotels must have the " locally needed " classification to get WMC help on labor . WMC also notified its regional directors that room service , including the serving of meals and beverages to guests too busy or too tired to walk to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50 per cent reduction in the average number of room-service employes on the payroll in 1941 , or in any subsequent year selected by the area director . Bed linen , the WMC directed , shall be changed " no oftener than twice a week for guests other than those on a daily basis . " Maid service , it decreed , shall be limited " to the maximum of once every 24 hours " for any one guest . The bath issue is covered by a provision limiting towel service to " no more than two face towels and one bath towel daily for any one guest . " Washable shower curtains may not be changed more than once a week . WMC defined a hotel as a " service establishment commonly known in the community as a hotel , providing a building with sleeping accommodations and possessing at least six guest rooms without cooking facilities for transient use on a daily basis . " Accepted With Resignation New York City 's hotel men accepted the newest WMC decrees , generally , with resignation and with somewhat less shock than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointed out that war conditions , principally labor shortage , had already enforced restrictions approximating those contained in the orders . Earle Goddard , night manager at the Hotel Astor , for example , said that room service had already been cut about 50 per cent as against 1941 because of the difficulty of getting help ; maid service was  --  and had been for some time ? around 65 per cent of what it was in 1941 and only one-third the number of peacetime bellboys were on call . " We have no room service after 1 A. M. , " Mr. Goddard pointed out , " not even bellhop room service and we have only two boys on night duty , devoted almost exclusively to rooming , where formerly we had six . " The limit on bath towels , Mr. Goddard admitted , was drastic . The Astor had , on its own volition and because of the shortage of laundry help , cut the number of bath towels a day from four td two and the number of face towels in the same proportion . It had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ linens for permanent guests twice a week and found that permanent guests seemed to prefer it so . He said he felt , though , that one bath towel each day might impose real hardship in New York 's humid summer climate . A spokesman for the WaldorfAstoria heard the new WMC orders and sighed . He would not commit himself beyond the statement : " Guess we 'll have to grin and bear it . " The Hotel New Yorker echoed Mr. Goddard 's opinion generally and agreed with him that natural restrictions had already imposed the curtailments in service decreed by the new WMC order . " Guess we 'll just have to take it , " the New Yorker man said . " We 've had to originate , on our own account , most of the things covered by the new WMC decrees . We do n't like it , particularly , but we know we 'll have to take it . So , I think , will patriotic guests . "                @ @ @ @ @
