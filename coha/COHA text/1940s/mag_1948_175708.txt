Railroader Robert R. Young had something new to show off . His Chesapeake &; Ohio Railway Co. had paid the Government $4,000,000 for the Greenbrier Hotel in White Sulphur Springs , W.Va. , famed watering place for pre-Civil War Southerners and resort for U.S. Presidents ( 13 had slept there ) . It had spent another $4,200,000 refurbishing it . <P> Last week , Bob Young gave hotelmen a splashy hang-the-cost exhibition of how he thought a hotel should be opened for business-and publicity . To 300 of the biggest wigs he could find , he sent invitations to his hotel-warming . In planes , automobiles and 14 private railroad cars they trooped in-Chase National Bank Chairman Winthrop Aldrich , Bing Crosby , Elsa Maxwell , Attorney General Tom Clark , the Duke &; Duchess of Windsor ( who arrived with 14 pieces of luggage to get them through their three-day stay ) , many another practitioner of the arts , professions and leisure-by-the-numbers . <P> Hotelman Young 's troubles started fast . Many ( 45% ) of the guests had barely been shown their rooms before they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reporter Igor Cassini ( Hearst 's Cholly Knickerbocker ) and his new wife ( Elizabeth Darrach Waters ) walked into their suite and found it occupied by Cassini 's ex-wife ( " Bootsie " McDonnell-also a columnist ) , who had been ushered in by mistake . ( They compromised on adjoining suites . ) Kaiser-Frazer 's Joe Frazer and Otis &; Co. ' s Cyrus Eaton , currently feuding over K-F 's stock troubles , spent the time busily dodging each other . <P> Drums by the Duke . Nevertheless , a good on-the-house time was had by nearly all . The guests roamed over the hotel 's 6,500 manicured acres , rode over its 200 miles of bridle paths , played golf on its three courses , lounged in rooms that will cost paying customers from $17 to $65 a day . The windup was a glittering ball in the chandelier-hung ballroom . At its height , the Duke of Windsor , a good amateur hand at the drums , joined Meyer Davis 's band and beat the skins ( How Are Things in Glocca Morra ? ) as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Reported Cholly Knickerbocker , in open-mouthed awe : " We doubt that even the Sultan of Turkey , the Emperor of China , or the Czar of Russia , when those fabulous courts were at their peak , ever attempted anything on a more colossal scale . " <P> Drapes by Draper . For the lush background for his party , Railroader Young had depended on Interior Decorator Dorothy Draper , who had spent more than a year getting Greenbrier ready . She had broken through large areas of white stucco walls and moved Greenbrier 's lobby from the second floor to sub-ground level . In it she placed $4,000 worth of palms ( to be replaced as needed ) to give an outdoor effect . Elsewhere , she used some of her typical tricks . To make some of the cavernous rooms more cozy , she set up latticed , movable walls . A typical bedroom had sky-blue walls , Tunis-blue furniture , sea-green draperies and carpet , and touches of red . <P> For the decorating job , Dorothy Draper , Inc. got $120,000 . To the C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After redoing the local station on the C. &; O. line , Mrs. Draper demanded that no smoke-belching locomotives be allowed within five miles of the place . But the coal-burning C. &; O. put its foot down , let the steamers on through .
