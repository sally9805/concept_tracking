Does prayer bring tangible results ? Last week the British Court of Appeals doubted it . A priory of Carmelite nuns had claimed they were entitled to accept a $20,000 trust fund left to them as a " charitable institution . " Their prayers benefited mankind , the nuns argued . Therefore , they were dispensing charity . <P> The court thought not . Said Lord Greene , denying the appeal : " This conception appears . . . unlike anything that has been considered in the past to be a good charity , and it can not , in my opinion , be justified by any known principles . "
