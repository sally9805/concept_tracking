txt Army of 100,000 Exiles on March As Sad Finns Leave Ceded Areas Uprooted Families Plod to New Borders ? Nation Tackles Task of Resettling 460,000 Left Without Homes By H. ESBELUND Wireless to THs NEW Yoinc Taos . HELSINKI , Finland , March ** drowned her sorrow in work today . Faced with immense problems , the grief-stricken nation welcomed heavy tasks as a means of forgetting the humiliation of the peace imposed by Russia . A new kind of army marched through Finland  --  refugees . The most immediate problem is the evacuation of more than 100,000 persons from the districts torn from Finland under the treaty . All highways and railroads in the ceded areas were crowded with Finnish families fleeing to the new borders with their cattle and whatever possessions they could carry . Automobiles , trains and wagons from all parts of Finland moved toward the lost districts to help with the evacuation . Despite this , there was a great scarcity of vehicles . Tens of thousands were forced to plod overland to ' get away before the Red Army moves in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their belongings . People were evacuated first , then cattle and last belongings . Most of those who walked in endless files along the highways carried bundles containing only clothing and a few days ' food . The evacuation is voluntary . No one is forced to leave . But officials , recalling prior boundary shifts , predicted that few Finns would choose to remain under a Russian regime . Soldiers helped the fleeing populace . Evacuees and uniformed men shared their food and the army gave what help it could to move belongings that the civilians could not carry . The migration is going on day and night without rest . In most places along the hundreds of miles of affected borderland the movement must proceed at a rate of about four miles a day to maintain the agreed schedule . In northern districts , where there are no rail . // 100,000 FINNS , MOVE FROM CEDED AREAS // ways , only a few vehicles were available and hundreds had no choice but to walk , taking with them only mhat they could carry . . With only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their forefathers lived for centuries . When the evacuation started last night the trains were still blacked out and in the confusion several hundred children were separated from their parents . Offices were established where relatives now may obtain information on the whereabouts of those with whom they have lost contact . About 600,000 Finns are without homes . Many of these were evacuated from large cities during the war because of air raids , but when those who still have homes return to them some 460,000 to 470,000 will remain without any place to go . The Finnish Government must bear the heavy expense of providing for these people . Homes and occupations for them will be one of the major problems facing the nation . During the war the cost of maintaining refugees was about $70,000 a day , but now it will be much higher . For the moment the problem of getting 100,000 uprooted civilians across the new border has priority . Temporarily they are being placed in the nearest villages so the available vehicles may go back to get more . Among the belongings of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nation Shifted Besides these 100,000 refugees , the government also must care for 370,000 already evacuated from territory given up . Serious social problems are envisaged in this transfer of one-eighth of the nation 's population from accustomed homes to uncertainty . Besides , the government must rebuild the towns shattered by Russian bombs . This it has pledged itself to do , though the war has been a heavy drain on ' the public finances . From Hangoe alone more than 2,000 must be evacuated . Many soldiers who arrived in Helsinki to rest after three and a half months of incessant fighting on the Karelian Isthmus immediately were sent to Hangoe to assist the refugees . While the evacuation is under way the government is discouraging unnecessary travel . Likewise , all licensed drivers are asked to volunteer to help with the evacuation and al ' horses and wagons from the districts behind the new frontier have been commandeered . The war has united Finland more than ever before . This is demonstrated by the willingness with which every one has plunged into the tasks of peace . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started off for new and troublesome tasks without a murmur . Sectionalism Is Removed When the evacuation is completed the Finnish people will be blended in a manner unprecedented . Hundreds of thousands of lively Karelians already are living among the silent Middle Finns and thousands from the Hangoe districts are dwelling along the Gulf of Bothnia . It is a complete migration . For the first time in many months the Helsinki streets were lighted up tonight . Although they are only half lighted as yet , the effect seems dazzling . People stand and gape as if they never had seen a street lamp . They obviously enjoy wandering about without fear of falling in a hole or stumbling on a snowdrift . During the war the city was always silent after dark , , but now trams are screeching and voices are heard everywhere . The writer talked this evening with a non-commissioned officer back from the front . In civil life he was a waiter at the Kaemp Hotel . He was in Helsinki to attend I the funeral of his brother , who was killed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funeral he is going to Hangoe immediately . " We subofficers were informed of peace an hour before the cessation of hostilities , " he said .. " I was in a small village about four miles southeast of Viborg . We had fought hard the day before , repulsing five Russian attacks . " The Russian radio had mentioned peace conditions , but we did - not believe it . When our commander informed us we still could not believe it and were downcast . " At 10:40 A. M. the men in the ? ranks were told of the peace . ' Have the Russians had enough ? ' they asked . They received the news in'differently and were not pleased that it was over . Then they were told of the conditions and ' it hurt them terribly . Many of us were unable to hide our tears when we saw the men 's faces . There was not one who did not say , ' We would rather fight on than take this ! " ' He was a rather young man , unshaved , exhausted , wearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ badly needed a haircut . He had been out . there since the day the war started . " It seems strange to be back , " he went on . " My ears are still full of the din out there . In the last hour we had a great artillery duel . We lost eight men the last morning . At precisely 2 minutes to 1i the artillery fire and all fighting stopped . For the first time in three and a half months there were no searing shells exploding near by every few seconds . " Today few here speak of peace . ' Every one is thinking of making the best possible use of the country that is left . The newspapers are full of new plans . Every page displays orders , requests for volunteer aid and - advice on how to save money . Several papers implore the people to give up luxuries and eat the cheapest food possible . " We grown-ups are largely able to manage on beets , potatoes and cabbage , which contain all the necessary vitamins , " one article says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , must have all the nourishing food they can get . Save on adult food , but give the children what they need . " Cigarettes , silk stockings , powder and the like , of course , must be cut down or banished . We must save as much as we can . " The diplomatic defeat was bitter , but today proved that the people have not lost their courage . On the contrary , they are now using their great energy to rebuild Finland . War 's Havoc Found Huge Special Cable to THE NEW YORK TIMES . HELSINKI , March ** only two civilian trains left Helsinki , one for Abo and the other for Vasa . But tomorrow and for six days to come there will be no more train traffic except for refugees and the military . Only 1 per cent of the population of the ceded areas has signified an intention to remain and the rest will be moved to the rear , ? according to information given out by Julio Koivisto , Assistant Minister of Agriculture . The greater part had been evacuated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain . An idea of the havoc wrought by Soviet planes in Finland 's home area can be gathered from Mr. Koivisto 's statement that- the gov- , ernment also must find homes for perhaps as many as 170,000 civilians whose homes were wrecked during the war . In all , close to ? 500,000 are immediate public charges for whom shelter , food and employment must be provided . Further evidence of the bombers ' damage is an estimate that Finnish industry lost 2,500,000,000 finmarks , equivalent to $50,000,000 , in wrecked plants and machinery . Maintenance of the evacuees is Costing the government 3,500,000 finmarks daily , to which must be added the cost of transportation . After - the evacuation is completed , new occupations , farms and homesteads must be found for the ' refugees , which is likely to provide a delicate social problem . The population ' around Vuoksi probably will be moved toward Vasa , but adilace for the Karelians has not yet been chosen .

The new United States Legation building is still unfinished , but meanwhile temporary quarters will be rented . Many institutions and business concerns have advertised that they are immediately ? returning to Helsinki , and all day people have been flocking back in all kinds of ? conveyances , including handpushed sleighs . Homeless May Reach 1,000,000 Special Cable to THE NEW YORK Taus. - STOCKHOLM , Sweden , March 14 ? It is estimated here that there may be as many as 1,000,000 homeless persons in Finland .

Thus some Finnish towns will remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of liquor will be lifted in due course . Soldiers are being demobilized in small groups and other appearances of war are fading slowly .
