" The Queen is dead , long live the Queen ! " whooped Hollywood 's Daily Variety . While Variety whooped , the movie pressagents trooped to lunch with Gossip Columnist Hedda Hopper . New " Queen " Hedda had just signed a contract with the Chicago Tribune-New York News Syndicate-a contract that nearly tripled the number of her readers . <P> The old queen-Hearst Gossip Columnist Louella Parsons-is not exactly dead . But her whims no longer command Hollywood . She still has 17,000,000 newspaper circulation , according to Hearst 's I.N.S. , through " several hundred outlets . " But at one stride Hedda had reached a circulation of 5,750,000 daily ( 7,500,000 Sunday ) through only 27 papers . <P> Hedda 's triumph was a triumph for gossip over news . On June 1 her column will supplant that of the New York Daily News 's John Chapman . During his two years in Hollywood he stuck to news , not gossip , " tried to report on the making of movies and let it go at that . " In the end , instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let go . <P> By contrast with Chapman , who was his own legman and even typed his own copy , Hedda Hopper is real Hollywood . Not by accident has she risen in four years to challenge Lolly Parsons as chief outlet for Hollywood publicity . At 52 , brown-haired , boisterous Hedda , who started life as plain Pennsylvania Quakeress Elda Furry , has been nearly 25 years in the movies ( acting in over 100 pictures ) , was the fifth of the late Actor DeWolf Hopper 's six wives , between times got " kicked around plenty " while staging fashion shows , coaching actors , selling real estate , even running for political office . <P> Much better liked than Lolly Parsons , when she started Hedda had to pit friendships and wits against the powerful inertia of Lolly 's 20-year reign on Hollywood 's gossip roost . Choice studio stories went first , automatically , to Lolly ; actors phoned her first and eloped afterwards lest she sideswipe them ever after . In addition to her column , Hedda 's schedule now includes three CBS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Los Angeles , which eats second-grade oranges ) , occasional magazine pieces , six movie shorts a year , some bit parts ( latest : Reap the Wild Wind ) . To manage this 135-hour week she employs two legmen , one rewrite woman , two girl clerks to handle fan mail , two secretaries to whom she dictates at the top of her lungs , from such characteristic jottings as : " Catalina and sleep . . . Stinkey Pinky . . . Test Pilot ... he has to have three steps to get on the love . . . Marie Antoinette . . . Mrs. Chauncey Olcott . . . . " Eighth member of Hedda 's staff is a " brain " named Dema Harshbarger.
