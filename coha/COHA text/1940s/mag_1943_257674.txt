The fir and oak-bearded hills were heavy with wet and the rain and sleet gathered great churning white heads and came roaring down . Swollen rivers rose first in the Pittsburgh industrial regions , then in West Virginia , Ohio , Kentucky , Tennessee , Alabama . <P> Also in high water were the Ouachita , Arkansas , upper Susquehanna , Chenango Rivers . Mules and field hands hiked quickly for higher ground . The cottonwood trees felt silt on their upper branches . The waters came in and rose to angry lifts . Their major attack was on the U.S. war industries . <P> The worst December flood ever in Pennsylvania , a State famous for its flood records and the Johnstown horror of 1889 , came mouthing the floating remains of chicken houses , sheds , fence rails and even sections of the fields . The flood drove workers from their lowland mills and homes . A dozen war plants stopped their lathes , cooled furnaces before the river could walk in and explode against them . <P> Worst hit was the Pittsburgh steel , coal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climbing at the rate of two licking inches every wet hour . The Allegheny lipped over and poured cold , dirty water onto the highways and down mine shafts-where sneezing pumps fought for a while and then gave up trying to keep the pits dry . The coal cars stood empty under a pewter sky . . . miles of them on the rights of way as coal mines sent their men home to salvage drenched belongings . Altogether 50,000 people felt the flood in their homes . <P> War production was battered and hurt . But it was not crippled ; the time and losses would be made up . One good result of the flood was a testing of the Civilian Defense forces . From Pittsburgh to Portsmouth along the Ohio , calls brought out 100,000 people , many of whom stayed on duty 36 hours . Food centers , patrol activities , traffic routing all went smoothly in their hands . Private armies of autos and trucks reacted a thousand miniature versions of the taxicab Battle of the Marne , going wherever they were most needed . Against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Against flood and high water the war effort did go on .
