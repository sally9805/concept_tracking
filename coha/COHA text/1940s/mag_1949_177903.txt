Was the traditional twelve-tone scale , Paris ' newspaper Le Figaro wondered , " exhausted to the point where a new tone scale should take its place ? " Or was it still possible " to discover new expressions and new harmonies " inside the old scale ? In short , had musical composition become " a problem of vocabulary or a problem of style ? " Last week , after mailing questionnaires to French composers to find out , Le Figaro had some answers . <P> Only one of the composers who replied thought the traditional scale was all washed up . Wrote 79-year-old but still rebellious Florent Schmitt : " The end of our twelve-tone system is inevitable . . . It has been tortured to the point where it is now as barren as an old skeleton . . . We have to venture into new fields . " His solution : an 18-tone scale , made of third-tone intervals instead of the usual half tones . <P> Shaggy Composer Arthur Honegger , one of France 's best , violently disagreed : " . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . would not serve any useful purpose . Modern man is already surrounded by such a lot of continuous noise that his sense of hearing is beginning to suffer from it . " But , he wrote , " this does not mean that it is impossible to say new things . . . Beethoven renewed music without adding a new chord , a new rhythm or a new melody not already employed by Bach , Haydn and Mozart . " <P> Added Composer Henry Barraud : " If there is any crisis , it is . . . a crisis of the imagination . . . What matters is that you have something to say . " <P> Dutch Engineer Cornelis Pot , 64 , arrived in Manhattan last week with a slightly different solution . For Pot , the old scale was still serviceable : the trouble lay in the way it was put to paper , with a confusion of sharps , flats and keys . In his Klavarscribo method ( " marvelously simple , simply marvelous , " says Pot happily ) , all of that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines that correspond to the keys of the piano , black notes for black keys , white for white .
