The 5,396th Dauntless rolled off the line last week in the sprawling El Segundo aircraft plant in Los Angeles County . No. 5,396 was the last of an honored breed : the Navy 's dive-bombing SBD ( for Scout Bomber , Douglas ) . <P> The SBD has been the backbone of the Navy 's air war in the Pacific . For a few months it will still be at war . But a more modern dive bomber has begun to edge the Dauntless out : Curtiss Corp . ' s Hell-diver ( SB2C ) . Over the months SBDs will gradually disappear from battle , be put out to pasture as advanced training planes . At the passing of this gallant Pegasus , Navy airmen grew sentimental . <P> Born in 1939 of mixed strains ( its perforated flaps are from a 1937 Northrop ) , the SBD was obsolescent by Pearl Harbor . But there was no plane ready to take its place . She had no bugs , no streaks of temperament ; she was a thoroughly honest aircraft . She could take a frightful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nutmeg graters . <P> Through the rugged , uphill fighting after Pearl Harbor , SBDs did their share and more , from Guadalcanal to Casablanca . They won glory at the Coral Sea and at Midway , were still out in front when the fleet began its winning drive across the Pacific . This week they were still in action at Guam and wherever the fleet struck , and-they had just hung a new naval battle record on the wall : among the 95 U.S. planes lost in the battle of the Philippine Sea ( TIME , July 3 ) there was not one Dauntless . <P> No one was much surprised . In SBD 's long record at war it has piled up another that is even more impressive : its loss ratio is the lowest of all U.S. carrier aircraft in the Pacific . So , when the last SBD squadron commander gives the last takeoff order- " Pilots , man your clunks " - the time-honored crack will not be in scorn . It will be a hail and farewell .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
