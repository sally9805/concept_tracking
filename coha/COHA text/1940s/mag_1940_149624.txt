There had never been anything like it . Maybe there never would be again . Only those who were actually on the scene knew what it was like . Wendell Willkie 's tour of the U. S. was not a mere campaign . It was an extraordinary phenomenon almost certain to make a notable exhibit in the museum of political history . Its ups and its downs were not reasonable . They were a fantastic form of political melodrama . <P> The men who accompanied Willkie on his travels saw the incredible story unfold . Some of them became as hardened to fabulous occurrences as a magician 's assistant . Some , refusing to believe , fixed their eyes only on the polls and political indexes . <P> According to the polls , Wendell Willkie last week seemed close to defeat . But a fact weightier than polls , sharper than experts , still gave him hope : this was 1940 , when nothing was certain but the sunrise . <P> Betting odds had been 7-5 on Roosevelt , with few takers ; they became 12-5 on Roosevelt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were being nourished as tenderly as a zoo keeper cherishes the last of a soon-to-be-extinct species . <P> At Pontiac , Mich. , young men in dirty overalls began to show Wendell Willkie the strength of Franklin Roosevelt 's political muscles . They came out of automotive and machine-tool plants to boo and Bronx-cheer . Pontiac-typically Midwest , a small town with a one-street business district-had just gone to work at 9 a.m. when the Willkie motor caravan passed through , with the bareheaded candidate waving from an open car , cameramen standing smoking in a truck , a score of shiny 1941 model cars stuffed with aides , newsmen and political small fry . Near the railroad tracks , a half-dozen blocks from the town centre , Willkie got his first real baptism by booing : a three-story red-brick General Motors assembly plant sprouted workers at every window , and up went the boos , loud , clear , mocking in the fresh Indian summer day . <P> Broader went Willkie 's forced smile . <P> Women and overalled children fringed the parade route , skittering along the sidewalks behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their one hour 's importance solemnly . From the sidewalks came an occasional " hurray ! " From the factories , from the men of Pontiac , came boos , hisses . <P> " Sticks &; Stones . " Oakland County 's limestone courthouse is a gingerbready , dishwater-grey building , set at the principal business intersection , Saginaw and Huron streets . Before it local Republicans had nailed together an uncovered yellow pineboard platform . There Willkie talked , his booming baritone sunk by hoarseness to a deep bass : earnest , forthright , without fireworks . <P> As he neared the speech 's end , from across the street a lean arm stretched above the crowd into pitching position . An egg splashed on one of the platform 's uprights . Willkie did n't notice . The crowd did . The booing grew . <P> Willkie told them off , votes or no votes . Said he , catcalling had taken the place of honest thinking in Germany and Italy before democratic government was lost there . Platform politicos , ringsiders clapped politely . The crowd stayed sullen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
