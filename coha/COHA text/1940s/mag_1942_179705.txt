Plywood-which replaces 250 pounds of scarce aluminum per airplane in making combat training planes-is growing scarce itself . <P> Industry officials say that if output of this manufactured lumber were doubled , or tripled , over the record 3 billion sq . ft. ( on a ? in. basis ) turned out last year , war needs would gobble it up . Beech Aircraft Corp . has already begun production on an all-plywood bomber trainer . Fairchild has been turning out all-plywood primary trainers for some time . Curtiss-Wright is using the same stuff to make twin-engined cargo airplanes . <P> Last week , Lawrence Ottinger , president of U.S. Plywood Corp. , told stockholders that their company 's " products had found their way into so many war uses that the company could not supply more than a fraction of the demand , despite substantial increases in production facilities . " A few production uses are : gliders , torpedo boats , mine sweepers , cargo vessels , army landing boats , defense housing , pipe , chemical vats , shipping containers . <P> Three steps have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) A group of furniture manufacturers of Jamestown , N.Y . ( the " Little Grand Rapids " ) formed American Aviation Corp . Aided by aviation technicians , the furniture men aim to provide plywood planes and gliders on a mass-production basis for the Navy . 2 ) In New York City , a group of plastics manufacturers formed the Plastic War Production Association , will pool machinery and knowledge . 3 ) WPB this week issued an order providing for complete allocation of Douglas fir among high priority holders . <P> Highly skilled labor and high-precision machinery , both scarce , are required to make plywood . Precisions adjustable to 1/1,000 of an inch , and scarce chemicals such as phenol ( used in the synthetic glue which made modern plywood possible ) are additional problems . Perhaps most formidable is the lack of giant " hot plate " presses which form this world 's strongest structural material under pressure up to 200 lb. per square inch .
