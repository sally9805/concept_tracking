LINDEN ON THE SAUGUS BRANCH ( 401 pp. ) - Elliot Paul - Random House ( $3.50 ) . <P> Elliot Paul is a literary handyman who once announced that he had found Paradise and went to live there . When his paradise ( the village of Santa Eulalia on the Balearic island of Iviza ) was bombed at the beginning of the Spanish Civil War , Paul got out and wrote the moving Life and Death of a Spanish Town . Six years later , wearing his nostalgia for Paris on his sleeve , he hit the bell again with The Last Time I Saw Paris , a gamy , garlicky recollection of Left Bank life . Now he is going back where he came from . Linden on the Saugus Branch is the story of Paul 's New England boyhood . At 56 , Author Paul seems convinced that those were the days . The present days being what they are , many readers of his own age ( and the romantically inclined among the others ) may agree with him . <P> Linden , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city of Malden , Mass. , on the outskirts of Boston . Employing either the faculty of total recall or a ready knack for improvisation , Paul sets down in detail a persuasive picture of New England life at the turn of the century . Author Paul is essentially a yarn-spinner , and Linden is largely a string of amusing and often indelicate anecdotes , but those who knew the area and the people will vouch for the genuine flavor . <P> Placid Loafers . In Linden , circa 1895 , the pace of life was leisurely . The horse-cars would stop while conductor and passengers got out to give some neighbor a hand . When a fire started , the volunteer fire fighters seldom got to the scene before the building was leveled . Most people worked hard but were not acquisitive enough , says Paul , to kill themselves at it . Even the town loafers , apparently a numerous caste , he remembers with respect for their placid bearing while their wives took in washing to support the family . But they were true to their natures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Linden , even to the point of eccentricity . <P> Linden was predominantly Protestant and officially dry , but the Massasoit House lay conveniently over the town line in wet Revere . Paul , who established a lifelong regard for alcohol in his teens , speaks with romantic awe of the Massasoit House crowd , which included his Uncle Reuben . They were kindly , lovable , generous , liberal , fair , colorful and manly . <P> Lindeners were basically easygoing , but could become aroused over really important issues . The streetcar company 's attempts to cut down a huge and historic linden tree on its right of way provoked an epic battle which cut through religious , political and even family lines . So did the argument as to whether the turn of the century came on Jan. 1 , 1900 or Jan. 1 , 1901 . Another question that provoked a fist fight : Can salmon best be grilled over birch or willow coals ?
