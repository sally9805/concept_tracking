Last August Andrei A. Gromyko , 35 , acting head of the Soviet Embassy , was named Soviet Ambassador to the U.S. , succeeding Maxim Litvinoff ( TIME , Aug. 30 ) . Last week Andrei Gromyko , a modest , bookish comrade , finally got around to the formality of presenting his credentials to Franklin Roosevelt . For this occasion , Ambassador Gromyko , an able diplomatic chef , dished up some minute cuts of political meat , skillfully smothered in diplomatic parsley . <P> The Parsley . Said the new Soviet Ambassador : The people of the Soviet Union feel " friendship and deep respect " for the U.S. people , are grateful for " receiving from the friendly American people not only moral , but substantial material sup port . . . . " The U.S.-British campaigns in North Africa and Sicily were " remarkable successes . " <P> The Meat . Most substantial chunk in the speech for U.S. citizens to chew on was Ambassador Gromyko 's " belief " that the Soviet Union expects to cooperate with the U.S. after the war : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her allies in Europe-will bring about closer collaboration of our countries in the postwar period , in the interests of general peace . " Discreetly tucked away behind the garnishing was a small tough bite . The Soviet still knows when the war really started and who stopped Hitler : " During the entire two years of this stubborn struggle . . . the heaviest burden of effort and sacrifices has fallen upon the Soviet Union . "
