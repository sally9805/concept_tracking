txt Prime Minister Winston Churchill landed at a British port today , having tray1 eled to and from his sea rendezvous safely on the battleship Prince of Wales . As every one knows , somewhere in the North Atlantic waters Mr. Churchill , accompanied by Gen. Sir John G. 1 Dill , Chief of the Imperial General Staff , and Admiral Sir Dudley Pound , First Sea Lord , and others , 1 met President Roosevelt with his heads of staff and the two groups held important conferences . Mr. Churchill was understood to be considering making a radio speech today or some time soon on the results of his conference with President Roosevelt and perhaps to shed light on the course of the joint British , American and Russian effort to defeat nazism , The United Press reported . Now Mr. Churchill is safely back in Britain and he will arrive in London tomorrow . He came back by the Iceland route , stopping off at Reykjavik and inspecting the British and American troops on the island . The huge ship with Mr. Churchill and the others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it was without incident . Despite all the German claims that their submarines , airplanes and surface raiders rule the Atlantic , this great convoy went out and back without incident . In fact the only time the Prince of Wales , which already ' has been in action against the Bismarck , fired her guns was when on the way home she sent a smoke shell skyward and then fired on it with her anti-aircraft guns . The exploding shells plastered the sky around the smoke shell burst while the Prime Minister watched . The Prince of Wales then fired a practice barrage with every anti-aircraft gun the big ship carries  --  and there are many on a modern British battleship . British destroyers met the Prince of Wales far at sea . In fact , on the other side of Iceland there was the usual swooping and scurrying as the escorting Canadian destroy , ers turned back . The Prince of 1 Wales must have slowed down if she was to allow the Canadian destroyers to keep her company , unless the vessels of that fleet have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Prince of Wales during the morning and 1 all that morning and afternoon big 1 Catalinas  --  PBYs to the United States Navy  --  scouted , ahead over the seas the Germans say they control . Overtook Big Convoy One of them reported a convoy , l miles ahead , and since Mr. Churchill had never seen one at sea the 1 course was altered to overtake it . As these ships  --  tankers , freighters and other craft  --  every kind and size  --  spread over the ocean , the Prince of Wales with her escort steamed over the horizon . Ranged in lines there were more than eight miles of pips in the convoy as the Prince of Wales and her escort swung up and around them , fussed their escort of corvettes and for- , mer United States destroyers . The Prince of Wales picked her I opening in the lines and dashed through with all her guns cocked up while the seamen , suddenly realizing what was happening , cheered and scrambled to the signal rails to hoist their cheering signals . Each of the escort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the convoy . What the commodore and captains of the convoy ships , trying to keep them in line , said , was not recorded . Then , as if that was not enough , the Prince of Wales and her escort shot two miles ahead , turned about and went through the convoy again . This time every crew had managed to dress ship , line the rails and cheer . It was undoubtedly a spectacular display but what the 1 convoy commander had to say this 1 time was not recorded either , and , if recorded , probably would not be printable . Then the Prince of Wales , having made her display , departed at full speed for Iceland , while the retired admiral on the bridge of the leading ship of the convoy ? an admiral who had left a corn , fortable berth in the United Services Club of London to command the convoy  --  called down soft blessings on her head . Mr. Churchill has been cussed heartily in his time . But it is doubtful if he has ever been cussed so heartily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is hard enough to keep a convoy in stations without having Prime Ministers on big battleships dashing through its lines with ambitious young destroyer commanders abetting him .
