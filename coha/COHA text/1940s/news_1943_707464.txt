txt Action by the House on legislation for absentee voting by the armed forces probably will be deferred until after the new session of Congress in January , according to the vie* in informed quarters . appears virtually certain that there will be no vote by the House on the resolution adopted by the Senate , supporting a wage increase of 8 cents an hour for 1,100,000 non-operating railroad workers , until after President Roosevelt has returned to Washington . Both delaying movements were conceded to be in the interest of possible compromise . One sought additional time for looking for a program which might block the Eastland - - McClellan State-rights substitute which was adopted by the Senate in preference to the Green-Lucas Federal balloting plan . The other looked to possible Presidential intercession in the proposed wage increase which has been disapproved by Fred M. Vinson , Director of Economic Stabilization , as being inflationary . Informal canvassers on the House side have indicated that the Senate absentee balloting measure would receive approval of not only the Committee on Election of the President , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House itself , if a vote came immediately . It is also indicated that the pay increase would be adopted if acted on now . Choice on Next Test The next test , as now indicated , will be on either the Senate substitute or a companion measure sponsored by Representative John E. Rankin of Mississippi , ranking majority member of the committee . Mr. Rankin predicted that both the committee and the House would adopt the Senate bill . " Sentiment for it is growing in the House , " he said , " and the propaganda now being aimed at it will help it more . " Representative ' Eugene Worley of Texas , chairman of the House committee and author of a bill already tabled , was hopeful that a plan would be devised that would win a majority of the House and that a Federal program would prevail . Informal soundings indicated that the **38;170;TOOLONG program now has material Republican support . In some Republican quarters apprehension was expressed that adoption of a Federal ballot plan would be contested in the courts on Constitutional grounds and possibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a President and Vice President , but also the Seventy-ninth CongiesS . . With the party expressing high - hopes of/winning control of the Houhe- and ' possibly the : Senate , if net- the Presidency , some shied from any ' measure over which controversy ml ht arise to interfere with the election . Representative Worley said he did not know when he would call another meeting of his committee for further consideration of the legislation before it . The House Committee on Interstate Commerce intended.to act today on the pay increase resolution but plans were changed . Word was received that Mr. Vinson wanted to be . heard before the committee voted , and arrangements were made to hear him on Thursday . If the committee reports the resolution out , as is expected , the measure would still require a rule before going to the floor , unless its sponsors called for a suspension of the rules , which would require a two-thirds vote for passage . It was believed that the committee could not obtain a rule before the Christmas recess begins .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
