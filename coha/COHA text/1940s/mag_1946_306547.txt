Resolved : that the Security Council under Article 34 of the Charter establish , a commission to ascertain the facts relating to the alleged border " violations along the frontier between Greece on the one hand and Albania , Bulgaria and Yugoslavia on the other . <P> The vote in favor was unanimous . Three months ago Russia had vetoed a similar proposal ; this time , although Russia 's Andrei Gromyko again brandished the veto , he failed to throw it . The U.N . Assembly which closed in triumph last fortnight had advised the big powers to use the veto with restraint . Last week they were doing so . <P> The Council agreed that all of Greece , Albania , Bulgaria and Yugoslavia should be open territory for the investigation . This was a compromise between Russia 's desire to include all of Greece but only the borders of the other three , and Britain 's desire to include all of the three Soviet satellite lands but only the borders of Greece . The investigators were directed to proceed to the trouble zone by Jan. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be represented . <P> What Is a Veto ? The prolonged argument over details and phrasing which led up to the final resolution added some weight to a growing and wholesome precedent : that an abstention is not a veto . During the recent Assembly meeting Russia 's Vishinsky had argued that an abstention is a veto . Last week Gromyko reversed Vishinsky , and Britain 's Cadogan backed him up . <P> Herschel Johnson of the U.S. , presiding , asked for votes in favor of a Mexican proposal to increase the number of nations participating in the Balkan inquiry from seven to eleven . Eight hands went up , but since Gromyko 's did not , Johnson declared the proposal defeated . Gromyko shook his head . Realizing that the Russian did not intend to veto , Johnson asked for negative votes . Only Poland and The Netherlands ( neither has a veto right ) responded . " Motion carried , " said Mr. Johnson . <P> Later , Sir Alexander Cadogan abstained from voting on a proposal to include the whole of Greek territory in the investigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if to say " No veto " ( or " After you , Alphonse " ) and the motion was carried . <P> Last week Athens reported heavy troop movements and concentrations in Yugoslavia 's Vardar Valley , north of Greece . It seemed likely that all such activity would stop before the Security Council investigators could get within gunshot . If Greece 's northern neighbors should hastily sweep everything under the rug , it would be up to the investigators to lift the rug .
