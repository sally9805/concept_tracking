The sulfa drugs are wonderful-and dangerous unless properly used . It was clear last week that this simple fact , unrealized by a large part of the public , was also unrealized by many members of the medical profession . Sulfa experts were worried about the common use of the drugs where the use was not specifically indicated . They were worried by the tendency of some physicians to prescribe sulfa without subsequently keeping a close eye on the patient . <P> Toxic reactions from the drugs are frequent-a survey of sulfas taken internally shows that some toxic reaction occurred in 29.8% of sulfapyridine cases , 11.8% of sulfathiazole and 7.7% of sulfadiazine . Most of these reactions are not dangerous , merely a nuisance ( e.g. , nausea , vomiting , dizziness , mild anemia , lack of appetite , tingling sensation ) , and do not interrupt treatment . But some rare reactions may prove fatal unless caught early . Even the less toxic sulfa derivatives can cause trouble : three cases at Johns Hopkins Hospital suffered not only kidney damage but brain injury from sulfathiazole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stated that seven out of 38 patients had kidney complications after sulfadiazine . Some of the danger signals are : headache , body ache , low urine output , high temperature , yellowish eyeballs , pallor and rash . <P> Sulfa deaths are very rare compared with the lives saved and considering the estimated ten or 15 million U.S. cases treated with sulfa drugs in a year . The great weight on sulfa 's credit side can be gauged by New York City 's mortality records : if the pre-sulfa mortality rate had prevailed , 10,341 New Yorkers would have died from 1936 to 1941 , of 14 diseases now treated with sulfa drugs . Actually only 4,475 died . For every 685 pneumonia deaths there was only one fatal sulfa reaction-a risk doctors and citizens agree is well worth taking .
