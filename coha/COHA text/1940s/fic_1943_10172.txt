invoked awoke . Perhaps they had talked of it , indeed , because its first tokens had reached them unconsciously . Fainter than scent , fainter than warmth , spring had , perhaps , announced herself directly to the waiting heart . But the next morning scent and warmth were there . Under the heavy covers George stirred and woke early ; tried to turn and throw the quilt off . But Helen lay against his shoulder , cramping his arm . Feeling her there , he relaxed and lay still , fearful of waking her , a new reflex taking the place of the casual movements , the turning over into chilled sheets of one who has always slept alone . Deeply asleep yet conscious of his waking , she sighed and moved closer in his arms . Outside the melting snow on the roofs dripped down , flashing in the newly risen sun . It was just three months and a day since they had been married . He could still feel surprise move within him at the thought that they were , that Helen was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to being alone , to remembering her dimly as a face in a fading photograph , as a chance at happiness that he had missed and that would never come again . No one knew , not even Lydia , what he had felt when she came back alone from the summer they had spent in Switzerland and the town buzzed with the news that Helen Walsh had married a Germanprofessor , met him and married him all in two months , and was never coming home again . Fall 1927 . George 's father was dying . A new wing was being added to the Peterson furniture plant . Lindberghwas a hero , and was Coolidge going to run again ? It was shame that he felt chiefly . What kind of man was he , to let some bastard Dutchy she hardly knew take her away ? How had she forgotten so easily  --  or had he only imagined that she had felt the way he did ? Why had n't he spoken to her , made it clear that she had to marry him ? What kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so easily ? Without a word . Lydia brought no word to anyone , just a general wish that all Helen 's friends could have been at her wedding ... . He hated her , he thought , but she would n't get out of his head . He found himself dreaming of her , of running with her through the high pastures of a dream Switzerland  --  he never thought of her in Germany ; Switzerland was the farthest his mind went . He could smell the flowers , it was so real . Nobody else was so real . There wasP51no other woman in Hackettston who could take her place in his dreams , no woman he met on his infrequent trips away . He knew it was useless , that he was fooling himself , but every penny he made  --  and because he did n't care particularly he made it fast  --  every penny was for her , if she ever needed it , ever wanted it , if her letters to Lydia ever hinted at wanting to come home ... . It was 1930 that woke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his mind , almost . The money went first , overnight , it seemed , and orders dropped and dropped and were canceled , and the market where he did n't have any more money went down and down . In the next year and the year after he saw what a fool he had been . He was n't young any longer . He knew that when he saw how helpless he was . And Helen Walsh was nothing but an impossible dream that he had been kidding himself with . There was a woman in some German town , Frau Waldemar Gottfried , who had been called Helen Walsh once . She was nothing to him . If she had come back without warning and passed him on the street he did n't think he would have known her . In spite of the money , in spite of the thankfulness he tried to feel that he was alone , with no demands upon him , he decided once to get married . He was frightened of the barren evenings alone . He could n't go out every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see him . They had their own worries . Allan Robyn 's white face . . . And there was nothing for him to do . He moved restlessly around the empty house , turning the lights on until the very light , staring out of every room , every uncurtained window , frightened him . He could n't go on living alone , he decided . He 'd get a wife . The one he picked was a cousin of Alice Parker 's from the West . She was n't particularly pretty , but he was thirty-five now and felt fifty and did n't think he could expect a pretty girl to look at him . She was sensible and quiet and seemed to like him . What was her name again  --  Martha Robinson ?  --  no , Robertson . But somehow he never got around to asking her . There was so damn much to do at the mill . So much detail he could n't trust to anyone else , and he had taken to working late . He kept trying to get over to see her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did get over she had gone . Gone the day before . He got tight with Harry , and by the time he went to bed he thought it was one of the funniest things that had ever hap- pened to him . He made up his mind to accept the life he had and not try for anything more . Helen came home two years later . Helen . Why , this was Helen ! In his arms . It was too much . He could feel his startled skin shiver at the realization . He would never get used to it , really , deep down . This was Helen . He did n't need to dream . He had her . Sometimes he could hardly believe it was n't a dream and he 'd catch her to him so hard to make sure she could n't slip away again , until she would gasp against his shoulder , " George dear , let me  --  breathe  --  " And he 'd have to laugh a little shamedly for doubting her love , his luck . It was true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to laugh . It was so enormously funny , how things went on just the same , just as they had before . He was still worrying about money ; probably he 'd been a fool to spend every cent he could scrape together on their Florida trip , prolonging it for a month , too , when Helen had seemed so happy . But he felt as if they had to have it . He had to carry her off . He wanted to take her someplace she 'd never been , she who 'd seen so many strange things he would never see . He wanted to be the stronger , the leader , to take her away to an enchantedcountry she had not imagined , to give both of them memories that they would not share with another soul they knew . And it had been worth it . It was something so beautiful they would never forget it , something outside of their lives , the commonplace lives that they seemed to be living on the outside . That was it . There was a secret core @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives , and Florida had been its open expression . Yes , he was still worrying about money , on the outside , driving the same car he 'd had for three years , getting down to the plant at nine o'clock , working late sometimes , dictating the same letters asking for payment to the same secretary . He saw the same people . They went to the movies at the same three old houses . Anybody glancing at his life would hardly notice the difference . After the first tipsy weeks of knowing she loved him  --  that was another reason why he 'd taken her to Florida , because he was drunk on her and the thought of having her and could n't bear to let anyone see  --  it had all settled down again , and things went on much the same way as before . Except that he had her and did n't want anything else out of life.  |p53Exce|pt  that the gray monotony he had lived in before was all gone . Except that the world had turned itself inside out for him . Everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he began to laugh . Helen woke . " George ? " she said dimly . " Um ? " He held her to him . " Look . It 's spring . Spring 's here already . " THE CLOCK on the stairs in the house Charlie Jennings had inheritedfrom his mother chimed eight o'clock . Charlie was getting dressed . He was a little late this morning . Generally he was into his shirt and tying his shoes by the time the first mellow stroke filled the house . It was a little game he played , to see if the shoes would be tied by the time the last stroke sounded . But today he shook his head a little , watching the motion in the glass . Eight o'clock and he was just brushing his hair . But it was such a beautiful morning he did n't care . Funny how this warmth held . For more than a week now the sun had beamed down on Hackettston , and the balmy air had spelled spring , even though spring on the calendar was still two weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thought automatically as he turned his head , squintingat his face , thinking for the ten thousandth time that he looked hardly over thirty . Not a line on his face . Hardly a gray hair . It would be cold again soon , his mind went on with its own special relevancy , and he was still wearing his heavy coat and being sensible . Sensible ! And his whole heart went up in laughter . This weather  --  it was really a private joke of his with God that it should come now , for it was the way he felt himself , warm and happy and thawed with a new spring already awake in his heart . He tried to imagine the face of his clerk if he came in this morning and said , " Good morning , Johnson . How do you like the weather I 've been making ? " He laughed again . 13ut really , everything was possible ! There are more things in heaven and earth . . . He began to whistle as he put on the pale green shirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 . Charlie put the shirt down on the chair as if it had burned him . For the first time in twelve years he had forgotten . This was the day his mother died , twelve years ago , in the big room across the hall where the door stood shut and the shades were drawn to this moment . She lay choking out her life with pneumonia , fightingand glaring at death and the doctor and the nurse and Charlie , too , until at three o'clock in the afternoon of March 5 , 1923 , the doctorcame out of the room and tapped Charlie on the shoulder . The hour hand of the clock had just come upright , and the whir that precededthe strike was beginning . It had sounded ominous to Charlie ever since . The last time he had been in to see his mother she had pulled herself violently up off her pillow and gasped at him , " Nobodyhelps me ! Nobody ! " The nurse had run over and got her to lie down again , waving Charlie out of the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better go in , " said the doctor now , kindly if clumsily . " She seems to want you . " Charlie 's eyes were agonized and his lips were dry . He wanted to say , I ca n't , but saying it was harder than going . He went down the hall and stumbled over the threshold as he went into the sunny room . His mother was lying on the bed quite still , quite white , quite relaxed . Charlie caught an immense breath of relief . It was over , then ; she was at peace . But the breath turned suddenly into a sob  --  perhaps relief too . He dropped to his knees beside the bed , clutched at the blankets , and tried with them to stifle the convulsive crying that was shaking him . There was a sudden horrible raucous gasp , and Charlie looked up into the wide blank eyes of his mother glaring at him . She was trying to raise her hand , but she could n't do more than twitch it a quarter of an inch toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her head rolled sideways . Charlie saw her face sometimes at night . In dreams he would see sometimes , behind a mist of other things  --  a mist he would try desperately to thicken  --  her eyes peering at him . He thought then , as much as one can think  --  perhaps , rather , he knew  --  that she had died glaring her hatred at him because he shook the bed . Strange how things become perverted in the dark , how her death , with her facep55all aglow with love as she had tried to say some word of affection to him , should invert itself into evil . But this was the anniversary , and he had forgotten it entirely . The day might have passed completely without his visit to the cemetery , carrying white carnations as he always did . They were so fresh , so pure . Days , weeks might have gone by without his remembering . He took out a plain white shirt and slipped his darkest suit off the hanger in the closet . There were no chimes from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For it was obvious why he had forgotten this year . This year something had happened , as it had not in the twelve years past . This year he had fallen in love with Lydia Walsh . It was the first time he permittedhimself to frame the words . What was the good of pretending , of tantalizing his devotion as he had delighted to , if the devotion must be denied ? He had made a game out of pretending that she was just Miss Walsh , what she had always been , knowing all the while it was n't true . But now why not admit it ? Turn the knife in his bosom ? Why not admit that he loved her and that this delight in a new love had made him unfaithful , forgetful of the greatest love in life . He had thought before , all through the last few weeks , that the new purpose he had found would be a deepening and intensification of his life  --  the thing he had been waiting for for forty-two years . He had even thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never got admitted into words , but he had felt , as in his dreams , that his mother would have been so happy  --  that Lydia was worthy of her , as no other woman in the world was . He had thought he had found the ultimate answer , the point , the truth . He had thought he was at last to be able to trace the pattern in life . But if it were denial , negation . . . ? He moaned coming downstairs , and then suppressed the sound in case Mrs. Parkinson , the housekeeper , should hear him . For if it were the ultimate , the pure , the highest , could it have be . gotten this neglect and forgetfulness ? Charles Jennings had lived a life of expectancy . Things had not come to him  --  perhaps at first because he had refused them , had preferred to wait for the best , the ideal . But if he had had any wish to compromise later it would have done no good . Things got out of the habit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mind and body , had always been inarticulate . He could only , at times , recognizeanother striving toward what seemed to him the same goal , though he had no name for what that might be . Lately his passion had fed more and more on itself . When he was very young his mother had wanted him to become a minister . Until his last year at high school he had no doubts himself . The ministry would be his . At night before he fell asleep he would lazily imagine his entry into the profession , his spectacular yet solidly achieved rise to the bishopric , his immortal labors there . . . . Or perhaps he would see himself as a queer , misunderstood figure , a hermit , but one who had found what everyone else had always been looking for  --  a mystic , another saint . The uneasiness began early in his senior year at high school . What started it he could not remember . Perhaps it was the dance  --  the dance he was not allowed to go to . The dance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange energy suddenly took possession of his passive spirit . He went out after supper , sneaked out while his mother was upstairs . He had been firmly determined to go . But as he got nearer to the gymnasium where the dance was being held , as he heard the music itself floating out through the open windows that let blasts of chill October air in onto the perspiring dancers , he lost his courage . He compromised with his rebellion by crouching beside one of the windows to watch , telling himself all the time that he would go in in a minute , that he just wanted to see how it went , who was there  --  of course he could dance if he just watched for a while first . But he did not move any closer . He stayed in his cramped position , huddled by the window , until the bare gymnasium with its rings looped up , its horizontal bars moved out of the way , emptied itself and he heard behind him the warning of voices of those leaving . It was after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when he came in she put her hand on her heart and turned her head from him and went upstairs to bed without a word . He could not remember now  --  he did not , indeed , remember any of this  --  that he had not been contrite or repentant , but thoroughly angry for days with himself and with her . All that winter the rebellion went on . He read books she had forbidden to him  --  she went over the required reading list carefully and crossed out several novels . She sent a note to the teacher explainingwhy Charles could not read them . " If he wishes to go top57college , " the teacher replied , " he will have to fulfill the requirements of this course . " Between them Charlie squirmed with loathing and indignation at the spectacle he was being made out to be . Then , with the teacher 's aid , he was permitted to borrow her copies of the forbiddenbooks and read them at school after hours . He was even allowed to browse farther afield in the shelves of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would go there when the final bell rang and , crouched on the floor by the bookcase , he would read until the last bit of twilight died . His mother would hardly look at him or speak to him . He tried to be home as little as possible . The ministry had vanished completely out of his head . A flaming future opened up before him , drawn from his books and from the talks he had with Miss Prichard . Her face would light up and become quite radiant during those conversations . Charlie thought she was beautiful . It was in May that he came down to breakfast one morning to find a letter at his plate . This was very strange , and he stared at it before he sat down . His mother said not one word . He turned it over and on the back saw the address from which it had come  --  St. John DivinityCollege . He put it down . as if it were a snake . For months the battle raged  --  he saying he would not go , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fought the battle out alone , for Miss Prichard had gone home for the summer to Maine . It was into Septemberbefore he won , before his mother gave up . It had been a hot summer . When she surrendered at last she told him that he had killed her and took to her bed . The neighbors talked and looked at him disapprovingly as he passed . He knew she was lying and quite calmly prepared to go away to State College , where he had filled out an application and been accepted months ago . It lasted for an entire year then , that revolt , from the autumn of 1909 to the autumn of 1910 . Then he went away to college , his mother still refusing to kiss him . Within two weeks he was overwhelmed with homesickness so black that it poisoned his food ; with horror at how he had hurt her so dreadful that he could not study . He wooed her through the mails . He told her how he hated the brute he had been . Finally when he came back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a while ; she would lay a thin hand against her heart and look at him with pain in her eyes . But at least she would look at him . He met Miss Prichard on the street and was rude to her . By the next summer his mother was willing to forget the pain he had caused her most of the time . But they both knew that the remembranceof that horrible year lay in her hands as the ultimate power . Charlie could n't do too much to make up to her for the hurt . So when he came back to Hackettston finally , after he 'd taken his law degree , he settled down with her at once . And really she was quite proud of him . It was n't the church , but still it was a profession , and one that a gentleman could follow with dignity . They both forgot easily enough , on the surface , that she had been going to make a man of God of him . He was quite content to be a small-town lawyer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the square and fussed over the cases that came into his hands  --  not many of them , for some reason . And she was happy to have him back . The past dropped away , and since there was never any danger of further revolt from Charlie , who had worn himself out in his one fight and who had hated his college years with deep , lonely hatred , his mother forgave him again every day . In spite of what with the years was becoming austerity and an almost glacial reserve , Charlie knew that her life was regulated around him . He felt sometimes as if he were living for both of them . He had the queer feeling that his mother would not have been shocked  --  or not only shocked  --  if he had done some quite adventurous , even wicked , things . Once when a woman leered at him in the street he felt a force behind him pushing him on to walk down the shabby street to her room  --  and the force was his mother 's avidity for experience , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shocking events could free her . All the way home , forgetting the girl 's mockingface as he turned away from her , he shuddered at the monstrosity of the thought . His mother ! His mother ! The purity of her profile , now fallen a little , alas , stung his eyes . And yet he could not erase the feeling as he came into the sitting room when he got home and she looked up and said , " Well , Charles ! Anything new today ? What 's going on downtown ? " Her eyes glittered at him eagerly . She died twelve years ago , but by that time his life was well formed . He could count on the fingers of one hand the changes that had been made in the house since her death . He himself changed less . Sometimes , afternoons in his office whenp59he was alone , he saw no change save the thinner and thinner trickle of his life through drabber and drabber years . He was almost ready to laugh at the vague spirit of expectancy that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would receive the sign , the little secret sign that would turn his life inside out and show him the patternfrom the right side , so he would understand it at once . But that was fantastic , he told himself . The feeling was dim now , only a tenuoushope that came into his face when he met a stranger  --  that did n't happen often  --  or when someone seemed to be about to say something that might offer a clue . But that happened even more seldom . And it had never been anything more than a few generalities that people blushed over and forgot . Until Lydia gave him the key . He had known her ever since he could remember . And all the time she had been the one ! That night at her sister 's house she had walked right into his life , fingered the dusty furniture stored there , and settled down . She was the occupant he had been waiting forever for . And then this morning . Charlie stirred his coffee , not looking , not noticing he had put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  that was false too . When he should have awakened early to the somberremembrance of his mother , he had overslept in the lap of some warm forgotten dream and seen nothing in the day but sunshine and spring breathing in the window . Was this angel who had claimed and crowned his life nothing but a hideous betrayer , an emissary of evil ? Must this new dream of fulfillment be cast out of his heart and his life wait anew , hopelessly , the passage of year after narrowing year , with death at the end , a little door so tiny he would have to crouch to creep through it ? Charlie got up desperately and left the table . His food gagged him . He shoved his hands into his overcoat and stuck his hat on just anyhow . He completely forgot his rubbers . The housekeeper-cook came out of the kitchen and stared in amazement , holding out an eggcup appealingly . Charlie could n't speak . He just shook his head and banged the front door behind him . He did n't know how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to be suddenly more business than he had had for a long time . He directed the clerk and the stenographer blindly , hoping to get rid of them , but they kept on bothering him . His thoughts whirled hopelessly , repetitiously , trying to find the true angle fromp6o which to judge what had happened . But it just made his head ache . He could n't seem to arrive at any decision . Finally he closed the office early and drove somnambulistically to the florist , where he bought his carnations . He was worn out . He could n't think . Perhaps something would come to him in the air . The last buildings ran out along the little road to the cemetery . He drove slowly in the afternoon sun the two or three miles , and strangely he found for the first time some measure of peace . The snow had all worn off , though one never knew when the sky would harden into gray again and the north wind roar down from the north woods . But the grass was an unbelievable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he came out on this anniversary he had found snow or bitter cold . This was pleasant . Relaxing in his weariness , he felt almost a quiet happiness in the gentle sun , the gentle spring . It was as if horror and struggle had dropped off him as he left the town . Life was peaceful beauty , full of westering sun , all open , all fresh and growing . At that moment he did not in the least care whether he achieved the answer to his uneasy waiting , or whether Lydia Walsh simply remained a woman he met occasionally at other people 's houses . He felt as if the little tight-knotted bundle that was his life had been flung open , spread flat , so that there was no intimacy , no unfamiliarity in it at all  --  and none needed . But when he stopped the car at the gate and left it with his flowers in his arms , the temperature seemed to have dropped . The wind was rising . This was the end of the thaw . This false spring had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too eternal to change . Sterile grass , sterile sky , sterile chilling sun . He walked along the path past the row of staring mausoleums , the little , useless , symbolic houses , danker inside their marble than ever honest earth was . The path swung in between the neat plots . He was an outsider , a stranger here . The ground under his feet was distrustful . He was not wanted in this quiet community . His motion , the solid flesh on his bones , the legs swinging pendulum-like from each hip joint , the crawling of his intestines , the clenching of his heart , these things were vieux jeu , were not in the mode here . To his right , behind a grove of marble urns upraised on tall shafts , he saw the figure of the caretaker standing solemnly doing nothing . It was as if he had paused for a moment , like some old monk , in con/sideration of the uneasiness his hurrying footsteps must evoke , to freeze into grateful stillness for a minute or two . Charlie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the grave lay in one corner , leaving ample room for others to be tucked into the same wide bed . Gravely he laid the carnations on the damp earth just in front of the headstone and sat down carefully on one of the little stone piers about the lot . There was still not a cloud in the sky , but the light seemed to lengthen and thicken as he sat there , and , sitting still , he felt the cuttingwind reddening his ears and lifting his hair . Yes , the thaw was over . Winter was returning to his heart , and snow would fall again this week , since he no longer cared . The carnations were already beginning to turn brown around the edges . Charlie stood up at last , cramped and stiff . Nothing had happened . Other years he had left his mother 's grave at peace , purged of emotion , filled with gentle rapture at feeling her presence near . He had had to fight sometimes to achieve the communication , but it had never failed . This year there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from him and refused to speak . No memories came to recall her . Her face was not even a dim blur before his eyes . He walked slowly down the path toward the gate . The caretaker came out toward him , his eager , lugubrious face ready to listen to any remarks that young Mr. Jennings cared to make . But Charlie said only , " Well , Walker , everything all right ? " and prepared to go on . But something stopped him . He stood for a minutestaring blankly at Walker , who looked back calmly , for he was quite used to various kinds of strangenesses . " Here , " said Charlie at last , reaching for his wallet , " use this for some flowers for the plot , will you ? Nice ones , simple ; see you have some blue ones among them . Planted , I mean ; keep an eye on them . " He walked out to the car and climbed in . For ten , fifteen minutes he sat there in a paralysis of excitement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hum under his breath and when he had turned the car and was really riding back to town he was singing . Because there was nothing there ! There was nothing there at all ! Of course he had felt nothing  --  there was nothing for him to feel . Other years ? It had been himself , of course , speaking to the conscious listener there . She was dead . Nothing could speak out of that grave.  | Nothing of his past life could reach across and hold off the future , deny the present . He had been given peace other years  --  but brushing his teeth at night gave him peace in just the same way . No one was responsible for him except himself . He was free ! All the things he could do swirled round in his head . He saw himselffeverishly dashing from one coveted activity to another , and he had never known that he coveted them . He saw himself selling the house ; or remodeling it , dismissing the housekeeper , and installing a Japanese butler ; marrying Lydia  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their honeymoon ; it was a wild , lovely medley that he sang to himself under the cloak of " Onward , Christian Soldiers " as he drove back to town . And then as he swung round the square , not quite knowing where he was going , he knew he was right , for there she was , just ahead of him . He knew he was being rewarded . He pushed the gas pedal down and hurried down the street , bouncing over the uneven pavementuntil he was able to pull the car over to the curb and call hoarsely : " Lydia ! Miss Walsh ! Lydia  --  may n't I drive you home ? " Lydia said yes , but as she climbed in beside him she felt a pang of desire to refuse . He had taken her by surprise , and she had said yes automatically because she had n't wanted to be alone any longer . She settled her bundles in her lap firmly , as if they were a barricade . Charlie would hold off her thoughts for a while ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't very helpful . He was perfectly silent , although a queer air of mirth seemed to hang about him . She had a spasm of wonder if he were drunk . " Very pretty time of year , " he said suddenly , desperately , as if he 'd been screwing up his courage to speak . " Very lovely . Spring  --  " Lydia was almost sure he was drunk and laid her hand firmly on the door handle , ready to open it and jump if necessary . " It is n't really spring yet , " she said peremptorily . " No , " Charlie agreed happily , his voice surer now , " but it 'll be alongsoon . Any minute now . " He seemed to find this funny and laughed . Good heavens ! thought Lydia . I must get rid of him before he collapses , or runs into something , or tries to make love to me . " You really need n't take me home , Charlie , " she said . " Do n't go outp63of your way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I can catch a streetcar . " " Well , I should say not ! " Charlie almost shouted . " Not today . No streetcars for you today . No trouble at all to run you home . " He laughed again and swung around a farm wagon , avoiding three childrenand a traffic stanchion with a neat zigzag . Lydia 's hand tightenedon the door handle . " This traffic ! Really getting annoying ! " said Charlie happily . He felt as if he could run right at a traffic policeman and have him bow and get out of the way . He was sorry for his speed and fine driving , however , when he drew up in front of Lydia 's house in the last of the sunshine . It was over now . She got out hastily and clumsily , holding her bundles tight . " Thank you , " she said , and as she spoke her eyes met his . Somethingqueer stirred within her , a recognition of something in his look , some yearning . Why , you 're not drunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't sober either , and she withdrew her eyes from that communion at once . She felt cruel doing it . He was so hopeful . He was begging for something , she thought . Does he want me to ask him to come in ? she wondered and hastily banged the car door against the possibility . " Thank you , " she said again , and Charlie let in the clutch with a sigh . The car careened down the street . She wished again that she had n't met him when she looked at her watch inside , after spilling her groceries on the kitchen table . His queer mood had upset her , had set her wondering about him , had made her conscious of people and reality . And she did n't want to be . Day after day , for the last three weeks now , it had been harder and harder for her to cling to the present and to forget the days slipping one by one off the calendar until the day when Preston would be calling up . . . . Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table , trying to use the tension of her arms against the working of her mind . Oh , why had she met Charlie ? It was n't quite time to get dinner , but it was so close to it that it would be useless to think of doing anything else . If only she could have spent this uneasy , unwanted little quarterof an hour of her life waiting for a streetcar ! She had carefully rationed her days , without admitting it to herself , of course , so there would be no times like this , no times that she had not provided cornpanyor reading matter or carefully censored thoughts for . And now she had betrayed herself.  | She took off her hat and coat and dropped them on one of the white-painted kitchen chairs , hardly knowing what she was doing and yet trying to make the movements as slow , as long , as possible . She felt so tired . Unconsciously she went over to the window and rested her forehead against the cool pane that the last afternoon sun gilded with deceptive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back porch and along the walk back from the gate had hard buds on them already , more than two months before they could hope to bloom . She would not see them bloom . She put her hands up to her head , but she could not stop the wave of reality that was coming now . She waited in fright for it to take her , as a swimmer watches surf gather toward him , higher and higher , nerving himself against the shock of the wave . For by the time those lilacs flowered  --  it was coming now ; she could feel the surge against her  --  she would be gone . Gone out of the house , every stick of furniture , every scrap of carpet , curtains , and clothes , her life uprooted ! It had her now on its crest . She turned from the window and dropped by the kitchen table , her head on her arms . She sobbed aloud in relief . For the breaking of her precarious self-control brought her peace . She knew it , a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing nothing save holding her mind tight against the abyss under her calm days . She had found power and pride in her ability to pass by that gaping hole in the floor of her existence without a glance  --  but that was so long ago , three weeks ago , a century of fear ago . That power had played her false . She had not had the strength to hold to it ; it had not really been hers . All along , against the seduction of ignoringthe truth , she had been feeling her conscience nagging . She admittedit all to herself in the deep gulping sobs that shook her  --  that shook her at last into relaxation . She stopped crying finally simply because she was tired . But she could feel ahead of her the possibility of rest , and that was more than she had felt for the last month . She leaned her head back against the wall and looked slowly around the kitchen . She blinked the tears out of her eyelids and ran her hand over the table , touched the chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They had been bought eleven years ago when she and Helen got the new stove and had the kitchen done . over , and they were still good and solid . The only problem that was connected with them now was whether she shouldp65try to sell them or put them in storage . That was all that was left . She had come to an end and she must realize it . She was truly and completely indifferent to what lay ahead . She wanted nothing . Sell or put in storage ? And all the linen ? And Father 's books ? Suddenly with these commonplace realistic questions her whole spirit rose in defiance . Her hands clenched on the edge of the kitchen table as she stood up . She left the room without noticing her hat and coat that had slipped off onto the floor . The desk in the living room hanged open , and she rummaged out the handful of notes she had made a month ago . She looked at them grimly for a moment . She had torn them in two , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of into the wastepaper basket . Perhaps it was because she did n't want to see them again when she took the basket out and emptied it in the dustbin . Three hundred and thirteen dollars , said the fragment on top of the pile . That was what she had , if her bonds had n't fallen still farther since she figured out this total . Say she needed seven hundred , seven hundred and fifty with interest ... Well , she 'd get it . She 'd go to George tomorrow . If he could n't help  --  but he would  --  she 'd ask anyone , write to perfect strangers . But she would not be defeated . Her eyebrows came together as she thought of the time she had wasted . She was utterly amazed at herself , and disgusted . What could she have been thinking of to do nothing , to pretend , to see that her time was taken with petty details of living ? She was eager for action now , impatient to match her brain against fate , almost sick with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself as inevitably classed with the defeated , the weaklings , who had not dared to fight ? ' She was not Dolly Robyn or Allan , both of them sinking deeper into a stranger and stranger world , where they had lost all chance of communicating with the reality they had lived with . She was not Elliott Wilshire , who had refused to face that world at all , or Caroline , who had run away . Pure anger filled her at the thought of her past weakness . Sickeningly indecisive , passive , yes ; " feminine " was the word  --  that was what she had been . She wanted , in a second 's flash , to hurt herself in some way for yielding to her woman 's body . But she shook off the urge . It was unhealthy to dwell on the past so . She still had a chance . Think ahead  --  there was time for a battle . And she was strong . She crumpled the torn notes in her hand as she stared around the room and out the window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tomorrow she would go to George for his help and advice . It had been harder than she had thought to reach George 's office . She dressed in perfect confidence that morning , arranged notes for her afternoon class ready on her desk , and started out . She had allowed time to walk down in the brisk March air , colder than yesterday , but still fine . And as she walked she had felt to her surprise that she was growing more and more frightened of the interview . You must do it , she kept telling herself . You have no right to hold onto pride now  --  for that was really it . She hated  --  oh , how it shamed her  --  to have to admit how stupid she had been  --  and to George , who had always respected her for her character . You must go through with it ! She clenched her teeth together as she came across the street toward the factory and summoned up her courage to go in through the double door into the splintery hall . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had George 's name on it . There was a new little girl typing behind the wooden rail who did n't know Lydia and made her sit down on the old golden-oak settee and wait before she could see George . She sat and hardened her heart and her mouth . She promised herself , as she still did sometimes on the way to the dentist : It 'll be over and done with in an hour , just an hour more . Think how good you 'll feel then . George came out himself , looking surprised and a little worried , and took her right into his office . She had to tell him right away ; she shook her head at his questions about her health ; she could n't answer ; she must get this done with ! " George , " she began , " you know the mortgage on the house , well . . . " She went on and on . It seemed to be a longer story than she had realized . She did n't look at him while she talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked her only one question as she finished : " When did you say it was due ? " " It must be , I think  --  I figured it out  --  three days from today . " And there was silence for a long moment in the room . " But why in the name of God , " said George at last , and his voice was louder than it needed to be , " why did n't you tell me this before ? "  |p67Lydia  eyes opened queerly as she stared back at him . The room wavered around her . She moistened her lips and dropped her gaze to her hands . " I did n't want to bother you , " she said . George opened his mouth then and talked for five minutes , perhaps , to that bent head . "  --  I might have managed then , but now , in three days , what can I do ? Do n't you realize there 's a question of time ? I might have arranged to let you have it one way or another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not sure . You would n't know , but I 've been having the devil of a time making collections . I have n't dared to draw more than enough to live on almost ever since we got back  --  I 've got to meet a pay roll twice a month " He stopped atlast because she did n't raise her head . And he was dreadfully ashamed of himself . She had come to him because he had never failed her . You could n't expect her to realize how difficult , how practically impossible , she had made everything by her stubbornness . After all , those bonds  --  he was partly responsible at any rate . He 'd lost his own shirt on the Brazilian issue , but still , he 'd told her to put her money there  --  what dopes they 'd been ! He could hardly remember how they 'd felt in those days when everything was going up faster and faster , and Harry Parker had given a champagne party , the stuff brought down from Canada , one Saturday night to celebrate the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them another in six months , when he had his second million . If the market had held through Christmas , George would have had half a million himself . He promised himself he was going to get out by Christmas . He 'd had a feeling something was wrong . But he had n't got out . And he had n't got Lydia out , which was more to the point . All this went through his head in half a second , along with the knowledge that Lydia had taken care of Helen for a year and a half before they were married . He stopped shouting . " I 'm sorry , " he said after a moment . " Forgive me , Lydia . I  --  it 's just that I 'm upset about this . Of course I 'll see what I can manage . You see , if you 'd let me know at once it would have been easier . Well , never mind . There 'll be another quarter due in another month or two , wo n't there ? We 'd better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her . He tried to sound purposeful , but his voice did n't even convince himself . She was silent when he finished . Finally she said , " I do n't want to put you to any trouble , George . I did n't realize --  It was awfully stupid . I thought , you know  --  I thought you 'd be able to let me have it or arrange something without any bother . I thought " You thought it was like six years ago , " said George , leaning back in his swivel chair and looking at the ceiling . " That 's O.K. , Lydia . It is n't your fault it 's not . If I could do it anyway , you 'd only have to ask , and you 're quite right to come to me even now . It 's just "  --  his hands gestured futilely , palms up  --  " I have n't got it . Do n't think I 'll let you down , Lydia . I 'll do everything I humanly can . But the money is beyond me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down an extra month , you know  --  " He stopped himself quickly . He did n't have to apologize to Lydia for what he and Helen did . " Taxes this month , you know , " he fumbled and was silent . After the first few words she did n't look at him . She had sunk into herself , her hands clasping and unclasping her pocketbook fastener . Just as her hands made a decisive movement in her lap and her body tightened for departure , George made himself speak again . " I 'm willing to do everything I can , Lydia . I 'll go and talk to Preston and see if we ca n't work out some way . " He was conscious that she was sitting taut , waiting to hear the next word , even though he did n't look at her . " Come in this afternoon late , will you ? I 'll let you know what he says . " He got up as she did . He meant to pat her shoulder , but it seemed silly , somehow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do n't worry too much , " he said awkwardly . " We 'll fix something up . " He nodded and smiled . But the smile faded as the door closed behind her . After she had gone George sat biting his lip , staring out the windowover the factory yard . There were piles of papers on the desk behind him to be attended to , but he did n't want to look at them ; he did n't want to think . Specifically , he did n't want to think about the interview with Preston Gilmore that he had promised Lydia to have . It was n't Preston 's bank any more . So it was n't a question of going to Preston and asking for what he wanted but of asking no more than Preston could give without a  --  he almost thought " reprimand " ; no , a query  --  query from Boston . And what Boston would ask of him for a mere thousand dollars ( counting in the sum that would be necessary to cover the next quarterly payment ) he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He could feel a slow anger beginning within him at the pass to which he was brought . A thousand dollars ! Why , he was worth at least fifty times that if he was worth a penny ! The mill itself -- but no . He must n't think that way . He could n't touch the mill . It had come down free and clear from one generation to another for seventy years , since his grandfather set up as a carpenter in Hackettston when he was mustered out of the Union Army in 1865 . He could n't touch it . But surely Preston would n't have to ask for any security ! If his name was n't good enough  --  but it would be , of course . He becameconscious , as he did occasionally , of the noise of the machines in the shops downstairs and in the long , low extension that he had added onto the main building in 1927 . He 'd always meant to add another extension on the other side of the square central building his father had put up in 1890 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-six men and girls working today . In 1928 , when he 'd had the plans for the second ell drawn up , he had four hundred and thirtytwo , counting helpers . You could n't say he needed space . Though things had picked up since that terrible spring of 1933 , when there had been days when he could hardly meet the eyes of the fifty-three men he still managed to keep on because he was afraid he was going to have to fire them the next day . And Helen  --  Helen had almost died out of his head ; she was so far away , so almost forgotten in spite of the letters that Lydia read to him , so academically , like a lesson in history a hundred years ago . And then suddenly there had been the incredible present , Helen caught in the wheels of horror and almost dragged under , and he 'd had to watch without being able to do anything to help . . . . I do n't know what the devil I 'm broodingabout this for , he thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing to do  --  see Preston . I wo n't know what 's what until I 've talked to him . " Give me 617 , " he said to the operator and waited , drumming on the desk . " I want Mr. Gilmore . Mr. Peterson calling . . . . Hello  --  Preston ? . . . Look , I want to stop in and see you for a second . Will you be in after lunch ? . . . No , I ca n't get away for lunch ; I 've got a spy coming . . . . Yeah  --  NRA investigator . How do you like that ? ... But look , I 'll try to make it by about two-thirty . O.K. ? . . . See you then . " He picked up his pen and started signing letters , grimly determined to think of nothing except just what he was doing . But he had n't got very far before he found himself swearing . God damn that woman , he thought . He was getting angrier . She had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought illogically . He tried to see himself refusing to help her  --  he had a perfect right to : Look , Lydia , my first duty must be to Helen . . . . Well , that certainly made him feel like a dirty coward , hiding behind Helen 's skirts . And what would Helen say if he refused to help her sister ? He wanted to call her up , suddenly , not to tell her about it , because that would n't be fair . It would worry her too much . But he just wanted to talk to her , to hear her voice , her laugh , but he was afraid . He was afraid he 'd betray his anxiety . He must n't turn to her like that whenever he had a problem . She must n't be burdened like this . He must n't put any weight on her . Even if he did n't tell her why he needed help , he must n't ask for it . He felt his love like a great fountain in his heart , a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see she got everything she wanted . He was shaken with emotion and with his desire to bring her the world as a gift . Thinking of her , he smiled slowly , and the weight that Lydia had put on his shoulders left him . He went back to signing his letters , trying various kinds of signatures . Lydia went home from George 's office with fear in her heart . She had gone to him so bravely and with such determination ; she had thought the battle was over when she nerved herself to begin the terribly difficult task of telling him all about what had happened . She had finally and virtuously been going to save the house . She had felt so glad , so strong , in her decision . Only suppose  --  suppose it did no good ? Suppose she could n't save the house ? Oh , it was n't fair ; it was n't fair ! She paced the living room , unable to sit down . She went out into the kitchen , looked at the stove and the icebox , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ o'clock class loomed , shadowing the afternoon . She tried to think of what she was going to talk to the children about today . No use . The desk haunted her . She would not go near it ! But it drew her step by step across the room . She stood looking at it , saying desperately , " I do n't care ; I do n't want to think . " All her fine new valiant mood of yesterday hung in shreds about her . It was only thep71thought of how definitely she had made up her mind to do the right thing yesterday that finally shamed her into sitting down and pulling out paper and pen . Who am I going to write to  --  what am I doing ? ; she thought . Then her hand traced carefully , unevenly , Mr. John Romaine . She looked at it . I do n't know his California address ! she thought and tried to throw down the pen . No . No . She could get it somewhere ; someone would know . She could have shaken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she wrote , and stared at the name of the richest man in Hackettston , whom she hardly knew . " I 'm afraid you will not remember me at once , " she wrote , " but I am in very deep trouble and am taking the liberty  --  " She stopped . Confess to a stranger that she was in deep trouble ? The thought almost nauseated her . But she bit her lip and went on. "  --  am taking the liberty of writing to you for help . " Oh no ! That was much too bald . "  --  am taking the liberty of appealing to an old acquaintance and fellow townsman . " No . She had no right to presume at all , and when she attempted to invoke rights they were grotesque . She dropped her head in her hands , biting the fat soft muscle by the thumb . What was she to say ? How could she say anything ? She crumpled up the paper she had been writing on and desperately , so that she would have no chance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Romaine , I am in very deep trouble , " she wrote , forming each letter carefully , distinctly . " We were classmates in grammar school . They want to take my house away from me . You do n't remember me . " You do n't remember me . That was the truth , and there was no use continuing after writing that . She did not know how long she had been sitting there looking straight in front of her at the brass inkstand when the clock struck two-thirty . Two-thirty ! Her class ! She started up , trying to forget that there was any reason why she should not hurry out to the clothes closet for hat and coat and close and lock the door of the house behind her . She managed to get the closet door open and then she stood looking at her old black hat with the feather on it while the blood drained from her heart . Coward ! I ca n't miss a class , she told herself wildly , but she knew it was no answer . The rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she could n't miss a class ! But the hysterical knowledge left her after a moment . Silly , she thought . This is all so exaggerated ! What is the trouble with me ? George is fixing everything up . She reached up her hand and took her hat from the shelf , her coat from its hanger . She hummed gently as she left the house , not looking in the living room at the open desk , not thinking one single little thought . Neither was George . He was sitting quietly opposite Preston in his office , feeling queer and uncomfortable in a straight chair with no broad desk in front of him to lean on . After a minute or two he knew there was no use at all in thinking . " There 's nothing I can do about it , " said Preston , leaning back wearily . " There was some question over this last thirty-day extension . I ca n't do any more . I 've done everything I could . It  --  I do n't know . She  --  somehow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's beside the point . I have no choice . It has to be cash down on Friday or  --  " He shrugged . There was a silence . George sucked in his lips , turning his hat awkwardly in his hands . He carefully read the name of the firm where he had bought it and his initials on the band . He was a beggar , he realized . Even if for someone else , he was a beggar . He did n't like it . There 's nothing Preston can do , he told himself , trying to beat down the anger that was rising within him . " I thought she 'd really get down to business after she was here a month ago , " said Preston suddenly . " But she only came to you today ? " " I did n't know a thing about it , " said George to his hat . " If she 'd only said something before . " " Preston , " he went on after a minute , " you 'd take a note , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picked up the heavy brass paper knife on his desk and weighed it in his hand . He looked up at George under his eyebrows and looked down again . " For myself  --  yes , of course . But  --  people who are n't right on the scene are n't always able to judge how good a security is . I 'm afraid  --  there 'd have to be some cash . Say four hundred . How long a note ? "  |p73George  pushed his lips out . It was the only movement his whole quiet body made . He had bargained before . But now his heart was n't in it . It was n't real . Preston could n't really be asking him for four hundred cash . " Ninety days , " he said . " There 'll be another quarter due before that . " " Four hundred in cash ? " " Well , unless I had a short note , say sixty days and "  --  Preston lowered his eyes again and hurried on  --  " and a lien on the factory . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Lien on the factory ! " said George . He sat perfectly still , but every muscle in his body ached to get up and throw Preston sprawling out of his swivel chair , to slam out of his office and bang the door so hard the building would shake . Who was he  --  he , George Peterson  --  to be treated like a bankrupt storekeeper ? He glared at Preston for a minute like an angry bull about to charge . " It 's not that I want it ! " said Preston quickly and louder than usual , admitting something that he would have refused to admit in any other fashion  --  because he was perhaps a little afraid of the fury in George 's eyes  --  but more because he realized how he had hurt and insulted his friend , and because he was willing to humiliate himself to help him a little . " My God , man ! Do you think I enjoy going through this with you and Lydia ? I 'm not a free agent , George  --  He stopped . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer anger in his voice but only a bewildered pain . " I ca n't give you a lien on the factory , " he said . " It 's never been touched since my grandfather set up here . I ca n't be the one to change that . And right now I have n't got a spare four hundred dollars to draw  --  not with taxes this month and insurance premiums  --  Helen is n't decently protected even yet . " He stopped and set his lips together . Damn it , he did n't have to tell Preston his private affairs any more than he had to tell Lydia . He was doing her a favor ; he must remember that . He was n't personally involved . " How long is this going to go on ? " he burst out again , working the vein of his fury over . But it felt mechanical this time ; it tasted bitter in his mouth . " How long are you and I going to have to be good little boys and do as we 're told and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking into the factory today and lookingit all over . . . Do you want to see the women 's cans ? I nearly asked him . You 've snooped into everything else . Five , six , seven years ago we did what we wanted ; nobody told us how to run our affairs . And the country was better off . Mind you , I 'm not saying Roosevelt is n't doing his best , and he means well , and something had to be done about unemployment  --  but this snooping and red tape . Hell , we used to make up our own minds and we did n't do so badly , did we ? Did we ? Now if it is n't the NRA it 's  --  it 's " " The international bankers , " said Preston , making a joke that was n't funny because . he knew George was hurt . George sat and blinked at the floor . It 's no good shouting at Preston , he told himself . It 's not even any good shouting about the government . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd probably do it again . Just because you get mad you do n't have to sound like one of Harry 's editorials . He thought all these things very carefully and took as long about it as he could because , despite all his common sense , he found that he had been shaken harder than he knew . He had n't realized it before because , relative to all the rest of Hackettston , he still had the same position he had seven years ago , or a better one , because he had married a charming woman . But he had bumped into something from outside of Hackettston today . And in relation to that impersonal force , that calm public judgment on his credit , he was no better off than the corner-grocery-store keeper . Or even worse . It did n't make sense . Why , he was an entrepreneur , a capitalist ! He 'd always given his occupation so when he had to register or fill out an income-tax blank . It was true that for the last four or five years he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had just been temporary , to help the Peterson Furniture Company weather the depression with as little trouble as possible . And it had weathered it . He was getting more orders now than for five years  --  though , as he had told Lydia , he had more trouble making collections than ever before . But that was just because things were still a little tight . They were on the upgrade now , and you could n't make him believe differently . Until today , at any rate . But a thousand dollars  --  and Preston could n't give it to him . It was n't the fact itself so much as the principle of the thing . Of course he 'd like to be able to help Lydia . But what hurt much more than the thought of her dismay was the blow to his pride , was the knowl/edge that in the eyes of the outside world of financiers and bankers George Peterson , third in direct line of descent from the founder , president of the Peterson Furniture Company , was n't worth lending a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He looked up after a few minutes  --  they seemed longer than they were . Preston was looking at him and , yes , he was pitying him . He looked away quickly before the angry pride that came at once into George 's eyes . " There 's no good beating about the bush , George , " he said . " That 's the best I can do . I wish I could do better . I wish  --  " I wish you did n't have to be mixed up in this too , he wanted to say . He had been defeated himself , had given in and become nothing but an employee of the people who had beaten him . He felt bitterly ashamed of it sometimes . He did n't like to have to watch George tasting defeat too . " I wish too , " said George , smiling suddenly . He stood up and stretched . " I 'll call you , Preston , " he said and went out . He climbed into the car but did n't start it at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It could n't be true . It was only because he 'd had to go for Lydia , because she 'd been such a damn muddling fool , because her credit was so bad  --  but the repetitions of these thoughts did him no good . He could n't get around the single unescapable central fact that Preston had not been able to trust him for a thousand dollars for three months . He tried to take it out on Lydia . He tried to ease himself by spilling anger on her . But he still felt gone , somehow , in his stomach . As if he 'd been standing on something that gave way under his feet , and even if he did n't plunge to destruction he had been too close to it . As he started the car he had a pang of temptation not to go back to the office . He wanted to go home to Helen . He wanted her very badly indeed , her gaiety and laughter and unconcern , and particularly her ignorance of what had happened . But he could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had to tell her what had happened . He had to admit to her that he was not worth a thousand dollars . Then as he came round the corner he saw the factory . He tried to see it , straining his eyes and mind , as it would look to the nameless people in Boston . But he could n't . It was his . And , by God , it was going to stay his , whatever they might think or say about him . He 'd been squeezed before . Things were getting better . Nothing wasp76going to stop him . He 'd held on for five years , had n't he ? He could hold on for a long time to come . He 'd show them , those sons of bitches from Boston , who said George Peterson was n't an A-i credit risk . They 'd laugh on the other side of their faces a year from now . He parked the car and slammed out and upstairs without thinking of Lydia at all . It was only when she came in about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her . He saw it in her set face that did not dare to hope , in the tension of her body . And he was ashamed of himself . He had been angry with her , steadily angry , until she came through that door . He had been angry for sensible reasons  --  because she had been stubbornly silent , because she had not come to him at once , when something might have been done . And he had been angry , too , for less logical reasons , reasons he did not like to admit  --  because she had come to him at all . Why did he have to get involved in this ? It was none of his affair . It had humiliated him , cut his pride deeply . Of course he was the right person for her to turn to  --  her brother-in-law , an old friend  --  he tried to tell himself . But he felt sick , physically sick with resentment , at the onus placed on him , the responsibility put on his shoulders by this queer feminine obstinacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak of it , and that could then suddenly break and dump everything into a man 's lap at the last minute , when nothing could be done . He saw himself beginning the conversation : God damn it , Lydia , what did you expect me to do ? Do n't you realize what a criminal fool you 've been ? He knew he could n't say it , of course , but he got some satisfaction out of repeating the phrases to himself . But when she came in he knew he did n't even want to say it . He was immensely sorry for her . " It 's no good , Lydia , " he said at once as gently as he could . " I 'm sorry . It 's not Preston 's fault , but he 's got to have cash . I have n't got it . I told you I did n't , you know . I 'm sorry . So  --  so is he . " Her face showed the strain she was under . " You ca n't raise it for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly , watching all expression die out of her face . He owed her more words , he thought , to tell her just why , perhaps to apologize for himself . But it was kinder not to give them top77her , since they could only condemn her negligence in not coming to him earlier . " I see , " she said dully . " Well , I guess there 's nothing to be done . Thank you for trying . " In spite of the finality of her words she sat without moving , as if unable to rise from her chair . In that broken attitude  --  he had never seen Lydia look beaten before  --  he saw , he believed , the indomitable pride that had made her " not want to bother " him . Clairvoyant for that second , he saw how much easier it had been for her to put this threat out of her mind , to pretend it was not there . He had had to do the same thing himself sometimes , to refuse to admit the possibility of the worst happening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sometimes you had to go on as if everything were all right . And Lydia had been trained to that privacy , that inhibition . She had lived her life alone because she had had to . It must have been hard enough , at the last , for her to come to him at all . And now hard to face it  --  the loss of her independence , the humiliation before the whole town . We must make it as easy as possible for her , he thought . " I wonder what I 'd better do about the furniture , " said Lydia wearily before he could speak . " Sell it or store it ? There 's so much  --  and I do n't suppose it will ever be used again , or wanted . I ca n't afford another house of my own . " " Do n't worry about that , " he said quickly , relieved that she was talking of details with acceptance in her voice . " I 'll have it looked over and valued and sell whatever you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . Between them then a silence fell and grew more tense . George had something to say , and Lydia knew it , and it was as good as said now  --  but it would n't come out . It meant a whole change in life , a new beginning . We 've got to make everything as easy for her as we can , George repeated to himself , but he still hesitated ; he wet his lips ; he felt the seconds prolong themselves while he hung on the verge of speech . And Lydia  --  what is she thinking ? his mind said slowly . She was perfectly rigid in her chair , not looking at him but staring past his shoulder out the window . It 's her due . She took Helen in without any question . What would people think if we did n't ? I  --  of course I do n't know  --  I should think she 'd rather not come ; she 's always beenp78alone and independent  --  probably she 'll say no . . . . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last he was able to say it . " Lydia , I do n't know if you 've thought at all yet of what you 're going to do now , where you 're going to want to live  --  but  --  well , Helen and I  --  " She was looking at him suddenly now , but he could n't read her face . What does she want ? he thought , and almost stopped in amazement , for the rigidity of her face and body were waiting , waiting . What does she want so ? he thought . She knows I have to ask her . Does she want not to come ? He had to go on . "  --  Helen and I could n't allow you to do anything but come to us . " " Oh no , I could n't think of it ! " Lydia answered in a flurried tone . She sounded unsure . Then what she wants is to come ? George puzzled again . Or not to come ? I ca n't make out . " I  --  I  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's nonsense ; I 'd be in the way . " " That 's nonsense , " said George stoutly . " I  --  Helen will insist , you know , when she hears about it . " " No , George , really . I 'd disturb all your arrangements . You would n't be comfortable . " " Now , Lydia , you 're not such a disturbing character as that . " He swallowed and hoped he sounded sincere . He did mean it . He was terribly sorry for Lydia . She had had a bad blow , and it would n't be easy at all for her to give up and get out of the house where she had lived all her life and see strangers living in it . He did want to help her . " We 'll just love to have you , Helen and I. " She was yielding ; he could see it . He was frightened , a quick shoot of fright , like a toothache . What the hell is the matter with me ? he thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any charity ? But he was feeling angry again , and angrier at Lydia 's shilly-shallying . She 's wanted to say yes all along , he thought , but she 's too genteel to do it without making me work like a horse to persuade her . " Maybe for a little while , " she said then , " maybe for a week or two , until I can turn around and see where I am . But I do n't even want to think of imposing  --  " " You 're not imposing , " said George as quietly as he could make himself , but he wanted to yell it . God damn the female sex anyway , he thought  --  all except Helen . That is n't fair to Lydia , somethingp79inside him answered . You do n't really want her , do you ? You know it . Is it so surprising that she should have an idea of it too ? And she has nowhere else to turn . Nowhere else . He felt very ashamed of. . himself , at his spurious anger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming , and she could n't help that . He tried to sound welcoming . " Helen and I just rattle around in that big house alone . We need you ; we really do . " She still would n't look at him though . He thought suddenly , She is just as ashamed of having to accept as I am angry to have to ask her . And yet he had thought before that she wanted to come . He stared at her . And then it was all too much for him . He had followed Lydia into the labyrinth of her thought as far as he could go . He had had enough . I 've been imagining things , he said to himself . What difference does it make , anyway , to anybody except Lydia ? It 's quite true , she ca n't disturb us . Nothing can . We love each other too thoroughly . " You 'll be a real help to both of us , Lydia . Keep us in touch with everything that 's going on , keep us from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worry now . Everything 's going to be all right . " She got up slowly to go . " Thank you , George , for everything you 've done . I 'll come around and see Helen tomorrow . We can talk things over then . " He held the door open , and she went out . He stared at the closed door for a little while , and then he shugged his shoulders and tried to forget about it all . Lydia , on the other side of the door , walked through the outer office and down the shabby stairs with her brain clenched as tight as her fists . Why should n't I go there ? was the first thought that relaxing tension allowed to slip through to consciousness . It 's stupid of me to have these ideas that George  --  that I What ideas ? asked theother half of her mind at once , and question and questioned thought were lost immediately . " There 's a divinity that shapes our ends , roughhew them as we will , " said something inside her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the page in one of those little blue volumes that each senior class at the high school bought and battered "  --  roughhew them as we will , " and a sign to look for an explanatory footnote . But she did n't want to look for a footnote . She wanted to read right on without stopping.  |p8o  She got into a streetcar at the corner and sat staring straight in front of her while the car crawled up the hill . I 've done my best , she thought . I 've given up and done without . No one can say I was extravagant . No one can say , even , that I brought it on myself . It was the expense of keeping Helen all those months  --  and she would n't lift a finger to help ! She tried to remind herself , as she always did when she began to think this way , of what Helen had gone through , of the shocking , horrible business that drove her to Paris and so home ; tried to tell herself charitably that Helen really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but she felt too tired to present these arguments in their usual fullness , and she went on letting her mind run as it wanted to . It 's due me , she thought , just as George had thought fifteen minutes before . But they did n't , perhaps , mean quite the same thing . I went to him , she thought , as I should have . I swallowed my pride . And it did n't do any good . If something 's meant to happen , it 'll happen . I was right before  --  yes , I was  --  to ignore it , to forget about it . And I 've been so lonely  --  lonely  --  lonely . No one has ever known ! She almost sobbed aloud in the streetcar . Now get a grip on yourself , she thought . Heavens , people will be staring in a minute . She looked around wildly and saw that she was almost home . She got out and walked up the street under the pale shadows of the trees and faced the house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the porch where the bare twigs of the wistaria writhed , the tall lilac bushes , the curtained windows  --  she knew so well just what she could see from each , which needed new curtains . Her house . And it had been betrayed . No matter what she told herself she knew now that something fundamental had broken ; some basic loyalty ' and integrity would leave her life with the loss of her independence , her loneliness . No matter who lived here next , or how much they loved it , she had betrayed the house  --  and all the life she had lived there . You 're hysterical , she thought as she went up the path , but she could n't stop herself , and when she got inside she just managed to close the front door and lean against it before she began to cry . This is the second time I 've cried like this , she thought in surprise . I have n't done it before for years and years ! I must stop  --  this is silly ! But she cried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the back door Helen put down her book , a bitter novel about the last war . She shuddered involuntarily as she did so , feeling as if she were shrugging a cape of horror and fear off her shoulders . She blinked quickly , waiting for George to bellow his first remark to her , feeling barely able to shout cheerfully back . But he was perfectly silent . He did n't speak to Nancy  --  not a word came out of the kitchen at all . Helen forgot her book entirely and turned to stare at the doorway . After a minute George appeared in it . Her first thought was , He 's terribly tired . Then she was suddenly frightened . Why did n't he speak ? What is it ? she wanted to cry . What is it ? Her heart pounded . He must have seen the fright in her face , for he smiled and said , " Hello , kitten . Have a good day ? " " Perfect . But you did n't  --  what 's the matter , dear ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was asking herself . Has he lost the factory ? In her terror her ideas became really lurid . Has he murdered someone by mistake ? Or been told he has tuberculosis ? " Yeah , " he said , coming across to sit beside her on the arm of her chair . " Take your coat off . You 'll get overheated . " " Uh-huh , " he said in assent , but he did n't move . Helen leaned back to look up at him . I 've got to know , she thought . I 'll count ten , and if he does n't tell me then , I 'll ask him right out . One  --  two  --  three . . . " Helen . " " Yes , dear ? " " I 've got some bad news . " Again he stopped and hung on dead center.  |p82Oh  , please , please go on , Helen prayed . " Is it about the factory ? " she managed to get out at last . " No ! " said George in a shout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothing ever goes wrong at the factory ! " He swallowed . No more putting it off . He hoped he had prepared her enough , but even if he had n't he could n't let her get ideas about anything wrong at the factory . " It 's about Lydia . " " About Lydia ! " Helen stared at him in blank amazement . " Is she ill ? Why did n't she call me ? " " No , no , she 's perfectly all right herself . It 's her mortgage . " " Her mortgage ! " repeated Helen , and felt an insane desire to laugh . She thought the world was falling to pieces , and there it was , nothing but Lydia worrying about her mortgage . " My goodness , George , " she said gaily , " you scared me nearly to death . I thought the most terrible things had happened ! For heaven 's sake , do n't ever again try to break anything to me gently . You 're terrible . I thought you 'd been indicted for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him . But he did n't look at her . His mouth was set and hard , and he stared past her at the carpet . Oh , dear , he 's taking it awfully seriously , she thought ; it 's something he 's been worrying about all day . Poor lamb , he wo n't eat any dinner unless I get him over it . " What 's the trouble with the mortgage , dear ? " she asked sympathetically . " I wish she would n't bother you with every little thing . I thought a house had a mortgage just the way it had a roof . Does n't everyone have one ? " " I have n't , " said George grimly , through his teeth . He still would n't look at her . She rubbed her head against his arm .. Oh , darling , do n't ! Do n't worry so . I ca n't bear it . It ca n't be worth it . It ca n't be important ! " You need n't worry about being left out . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then you can hold up your head with anyone  --  " " Helen ! This  --  it 's not funny  --  " " Ah , darling , I 'm sorry . Forgive me . I wo n't tease . Tell me about it . I 'm anxious to hear . " She composed herself as though to listen to a long tale . " Well , there 's nothing to tell , " said George stubbornly , now that she was listening . " It 's just that she has n't been able to meet payments.  |p83on  the mortgage for over half a year and very foolishly told no one about it , and now  --  now she 's losing her house . " " Losing her house ! " Helen stared at him , thunderstruck . " Why  --  can they do that ? It sounds like East Lynne . " George drew a deep breath . " Look , Helen , you know what a mortgageis ; you borrow money and put up something  --  Lydia put up her house  --  as security . " " Of course . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , that 's why the old Hinckley place is for sale . " " Yes . No ! That was taken over for taxes . Well , anyway , the bank holds the mortgage , and it 's foreclosing on Lydia 's house . Because for more than six months she has n't paid a penny of interest or the part of the principal she agreed to pay off every three months , and she owes some more from before that , too , when she paid some but not all " He stopped , feeling confused , and decided to begin again . But Helen understood without grammar . " Oh , poor Lydia ! " she said . " Poor Lydia , " she repeated mechanically , staring now , unseeing , at the floor . For her mind was saying , before she could stop it , Oh , how lucky I am that it 's not me ! How lucky that I do n't care ! No , no , I must n't think that way , she tried to tell herself . She knew , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what this must mean to her sister . She knew how shamed Lydia must be at the loss of her independence , how really desolated at the loss of her old home where she had lived forever . Yet she could not feel in her bones the effortlesswellspring of pity . She tried to whip herself into the mood , saying , It was my house too ; I grew up there , but the thought was alien . She 'd had to tear her roots up so many times that the first of them , of her childhood , were dead these many years . She had always been glad she was grown up . Her childhood had been full of incomprehensible worries and frights , and it was wonderful to be living in a rational adult world . She was anything but sentimental about her childhood . But the house held Lydia 's whole world . " I suppose , " she asked tentatively , trying to phrase it right , " that there 's nothing anyone can do ? " George answered her thought . " I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stiff terms for settlement . " " Of course , of course ! " She turned her head and hastily kissed the hand that lay on her shoulder to show she understood that he could n't do anything . " mlong as she possibly could . " I should n't have shown you weakness in hearts when it was n't weak enough . " " I 'm afraid Mrs. Duke has been a little weak on hearts too , " said Lydia , smiling at her cards . There was an appalled silence . Connie 's hand tightened on the cards , bending them . " Do n't be silly , " said Helen after a minute in which she could n't believe her ears . " She had four to the ace queen , fine support for her clubs " Do n't bother , Helen , " said Connie . " It does n't matter . " But the hand holding the cards was shaking . Mrs. Davis was studying her cards gravely , pretending not to know anything was going on . " Why did you come here anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perfectly self-possessed . " You must see it was a stupid thing to do . You just make everyone uncomfortable , and you ca n't have enjoyed it . I 'd go if I were you . " " Lydia ! " cried Helen in panic . What has got into her ? she was thinking . She might say anything ; she 's not responsible for herself ; I 've got to stop her . " Lyddy , please stop  --  stop at once ! This is none of your business ! " " Let go of my arm , Helen . You 're too excited . I 'm just giving Mrs. Duke some advice she seems to need . For her own good . It does n't matter to me if she has no shame and very little sense  --  " " Lydia , I insist you stop this minute ! I never  --  Connie , please forgive  --  she 's not  --  Oh , Mrs. Davis , wo n't you help me ? Alice ! " " Helen , how dare you make a scene ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utter consternation . Shedrew a deep breath and turned to look again for Alice Parker . Alice was standing up across the room , and before Helen could call again she started to move forward . " Have n't you done enough harm ? " asked Lydia , still in a quiet , almost conversational tone , leaning toward Connie . " I ca n't have my sister upset . You know she 's not well . Why do n't you go ? Why do n't you just get up and go now ? Why do n't you go ? " Her voice did n't rise , but it grew more intense. **25;8782;TOOLONG out of bed , slung the dressing-gown over one shoulder and caught her by the time she reached the door . " Okay , " he said soothingly , clutching her arm . " I 'll call Hollis . And Clistie . I 'll call Clistie . " " But she 's not here . She 's not been to bed . I 'm  --  I 'm afraid it 's Clistie that screamed ... . Agnew 's sleepy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were bright and wide awake . After an instant , he said , rapidly , " Vicky , you 're afraid . You 're thinking about Henry . Nothing 's happened . You heard only a  --  a rabbit , or a bird or .. She pulled away from his clutch on her arm and he followed her into the hall . And Clistie stood there . Clistie in the green dressing-gown , clutching it up tight around her throat ; she still wore her turquoise slippers because Victoria could see them , below the tailored ankle-length dressing-gown . " Clistie , where have you been ? You were n't in your room a minute ago . Did you hear it ? " " Sh  --  sh  --  You 'll wake the house . I was  --  was downstairs , making sure the gas was turned off . Ernestine is so careless . " " But your dressing-gown was on the bed .... " " I just now put it on . Victoria , what 's wrong ? Did I hear what ? " She put her thin , strong hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the matter ? " " She 's had a nightmare , " said Agnew in a husky whisper . " It was n't a nightmare , " protested Victoria , whispering , too . " Clistie , somebody down in the pine woods . . . " " She says somebody screamed , " cut in Agnew . " She 's been dreaming . " " There was a horrible scream and then  --  then a kind of splash . As if somebody . . . " Victoria caught her breath sharply , and said , " I mean something had been let down in the river . " Clistie 's narrow , long face was always sallow . There , in that night-lighted hall , though , with the closed , dark panels of the line of bedroom doors beyond her , it looked suddenly waxen . " Screamed ? "   " Yes . Yes , Clistie , I 'm sure ! " " She 's thinking about Henry ; dreaming about it , I mean , " said Agnew . " I 've had some nightmares myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot milk and put her to bed . " He peered at Victoria and exclaimed , " For gosh ' sake , Vicky , you 've not even undressed ! You came up to bed ages ago . Where have you been ? " " On the balcony , " said Victoria shortly . They were all whispering , their words making vehement , rustling little echoes along the empty walls and down the stairwell . " That 's why I heard it . It was loud and high and it  --  it stopped . . . " said Victoria , and tried to tell them how it stopped and could n't . " Did n't you hear it ? " " I certainly did n't hear anybody scream , " said Clistie . " You go to bed , Victoria . It 's late . You go to bed , too , Agnew . " " But , Clistie , we 've got to go down to the pine woods . I . . . Oh , wo n't you understand , both of you ! Somebody was being " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clistie 's dark eyes flickered . Agnew looked uneasy , and rubbed one bare ankle over the other . Clistie said , " Look here , Vicky . Will you go to bed if I send somebody down to the pine woods with lights ? You 're  --  " she hesitated and said  --  " you 're sure it was in the pine woods ? " " Oh , yes . Nothing moved in the garden . It 's so moonlight I would have seen it . We must hurry , Clistie ... . " I 'll call somebody . I 'll see to it . " " I 'm going with you , " said Agnew . Clistie shook her head authoritatively . But Clistie did believe her story now , thought Victoria , for she too looked frightened and the thin , hard hand that clutched her dressing-gown together at her throat was white-knuckled and tense . " No , you ca n't go , " said Clistie to Agnew . " I 'll call Judson on the house phone and tell him to take a light and look . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll both go back to bed . " " But . . . " began Agnew rebelliously . Clistie cut him off short . " I wo n't do a thing unless you both go to bed . Go on , now , Agnew , you mind me . " Agnew scuffled his bare feet , looked sulky , but was routed by Clistie 's habitual authority and vehemence . Victoria said , " No , I 'm going . ... " But she too was defeatedby Clistie , who shot an imperative glance at Agnew which sent him reluctantly backward into his bedroom . She took Victoriaby the arm . " Now you come along with me . You ca n't go any place dressed like that . If anybody really was down there in the pine woods ... " Clistie 's throat seemed to choke a little , but she said , " Screaming  --  we 'd better get Judson right away and no time wasted . I 'll ring him as soon as you go to your room and go to bed .. . . Everybody minded Clistie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Victoria . " All right , all right , " whispered Clistie . " I 'll see to it . I always do see to things , do n't I ? Now be a good girl and go to bed . I promise you there 'll be a thorough search . I 'll bring you some hot milk and tell you about it . Go on , now .... " She gave Victoria a little shove toward her bedroom and , turning , patteredquickly away . The telephone that connected with Judson 's cottage was in the hall , downstairs . Everybody obeyed Clistie . She was utterly resourceful and efficient . Nobody ever questioned her ability or her methods or her decisions . To Clistie , naturally , Hollis and Agnew and Victoriawere still children and would always remain children . But even Bessie yielded to Clistie . Victoria went reluctantly into her room . Clistie was right , of course . Victoria could n't do much in the way of searching the pine woods  --  in a yellow chiffon dinner gown and gold sandals . She went out on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the garden , the paths , the silvered river were empty and utterly silent . The black blotch that was the pine woods was silent too . Had she fallen suddenly asleep and dreamed ? But she knew she had n't . Presently there would be lights going toward the pine woods . And presently Clistie would come back . She 'd better change . She went back into her room , turned on lights , took off her slippers and dress , and went to the windows and looked again and could see nothing . But Judson would take the path fromP53the cottage , behind the black yew hedge . She returned to her dressing room and put on slacks and a sweater and tennis shoes . And then , after awhile , took them off again , and went to bed and could n't stay there . She wandered to the windows and stared down at the black and white world , hushed and still  --  with no lights showing anywhere . She went back to bed . She wrapped herself in the dressing-gown again and went out on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could see ; no glancing lights ; no voices ; no sound at all . It probably had n't been as long as it suddenly seemed , since she 'd watched Clistie go toward the stairs . She wished she 'd looked at the clock . She did so then , wandering into the little dressing room , stopping to light a cigarette , nervously . She ought to have insisted ; she ought to have gone herself . She ought to have done anything that was decisive  --  instead of prowling like a nervous cat from window to balcony and back again ! What was happening in the pine woods ? She had been sitting with the little gold clock in her hand , at the dressing table ; she had n't looked at the clock at all . She looked then and it was almost two . How long had it been since Clistie went downstairs and why did n't she come back ? She could n't wait any longer . She got up , put out her cigarette with jerky fingers and reached again for the slacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door and called , low-voiced , " Vicky . Vicky , are you still awake ? " She went to the dressing-room door . " Is Clistie back ? " Agnew said , " Oh , there you are , " and came in . He was still in pajamas . His face was so pale that the freckles stood out , and he 'd put on his spectacles so he looked very odd with his blond , straight hair lanky and rumpled , and his bare , bony feet and pajamas . " Where 's Clistie ? " " I do n't know . I 've been waiting . I 'm going down there . " " She did n't call Hollis , " said Agnew . " I waited and waited . Then I got up , just now , and went to Hollis ' room , and she had n't called him . He 's in bed and asleep ; he did n't hear me open the door , but I could see him there in bed , the moonlight is so bright . She did n't call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . Vicky , she ought to have come back by now . It 's been over an hour . " " Oh , no , it ca n't have been so long ! " " It is , though . Vicky , what do you suppose ... ? " " Go and dress . Hurry . I 'll telephone Judson 's house . " " No , I will , " said Agnew . " While you dress . " He slid out the door again . Nothing , of course , had happened . Nothing could have happened . Victoria 's hands fastening the slacks and shoelaces were clumsy and fumbling . She pulled the sweater over her head and was in the hall when Agnew came running up the stairs . His face was whiter than ever . " Judson says she did n't telephone at all . He was asleep . She 's not in her room and she 's not downstairs . Vicky , where do you think she is ? Vicky , did you really hear something in the pine woods ? " " Call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I already told him to come to the house , " said Agnew , and gave her a queer unsteady look as if he were on the verge of tears and then wheeled around to run to Hollis ' room . Victoria followed him . Clistie would be furious if they roused the house to look for her . But Clistie ought to have returned before now . Clistie  --  and that scream down in the pine woods . She reached the door of Hollis ' room and he was awake , trying to understand Agnew , sitting up abruptly . " Scream ! " he cried , and saw Victoria . " For God 's sake , Victoria , what does he mean ? " They tried to tell him , both speaking at once . " How long ago ? " he said , getting out of bed . " Almost an hour , " said Agnew . " Here 's your pants . " " Are you sure she 's not in the house ? " " I looked downstairs . And she 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We 'd better take a look . If she went alone down to the pine woods . . . " He gave Victoria a swift glance . His hard , light-blue eyes had bright black pupils . " That 's funny about the scream . When did you hear it ? What was it ? " She told him again . As she finished , they heard the distant , muffled peal of a bell .   " There 's Judson now , " said Hollis . " Vicky , you and Agnew search the house again . Better wake Mother and tell her . And wake Michael . " He ran downstairs to open the front door for the gardener , Judson , a heavy , slow Scotchman , fifty or thereabouts , with a light hand for seedlings and a heavy hand for subordinates . Suppose Clistie came walking in from , say , the south porch , unperturbed , angry because of the fuss they were making , thought Victoria . But she 'd call Michael anyway . Michael , too , was asleep . Agnew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and turned on the bedlight and sat up , blinking . " What 's the matter ? Victoria , what 's wrong ? " " Oh , Michael , it 's Clistie . . . Again , both talking at once , they told him . Michael saw that she was terrified . He was out of bed and in bathrobe and slippers before they had finished . " Have they got lights ? Do n't be frightened , Vicky . Nothing could have happened to her . . . . " " Happened to whom ? " cried Bessie from the doorway . " What 's everybody running around and shouting about ? Agnew , put your slippers on . Really , Victoria ... " They told her , too , rapidly . Bessie cried brokenly , " Like Henry ! Like  --  oh , what am I saying ! " She caught herself quickly , her face and lips like ashes , her dark eyes showing frightened white rims . Her hair was streaming over her shoulders and she wore a pink chiffon negligee , a little draggled . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glitteredat her throat , and bracelets were on her wrists and rings on her fingers . " I 'll get you a flashlight , Michael , " she said . " But nothing could have happened . " Michael , running toward the stairs , called back to Victoria reassuringly . " Do n't worry . We 'll find her . It 'll be all right . " Bessie hurried to her own room , snatched up a flashlight , and ran to hand it to Michael , over the stair railing . Thalia had been awakened too , and came hurriedly from her room . Even then she was lovely  --  soft dark hair smooth , heavy blue taffeta dressing-gown fresh and uncrumpled and tied neatly at her slender little waist with purple velvet ribbons . " What is the matter ? " Thalia cried , staring at them . " Is the house burning down ? " " He said to search the house , " said Agnew . " Come on ... . Search the house , of course . Clistie must be there  --  fallen asleep somewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the porch either . Or in the gardens . She was n't in the garage and none of the cars was gone . She was n't in the greenhouse ; certainly she was n't in the little lodge house at the gate . And if she was in the pine woods , she did n't answer to voices calling her , and the men , looking now in earnest , found no trace of her having been there . By that time the servants were roused and it was beginning to be light . At six o'clock they telephoned the state police station at the little town of Ponte Verde  --  the small , now crowded county seat . Somebody  --  Jody , probably  --  had made coffee . They had sat around in the hall by the telephone , pale and disheveled , drinking it , discussing whether or not to call the police for a long time before they finally decided to do so ; there was , after all , so little to tell them . A scream that only Victoria had heard ; a distant splash . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and quietly disappeared . " I simply do n't understand it , " said Bessie fretfully , looking at Victoria . " Why in the world did you let her leave like that ? Alone ! After what you heard ... . Michael , standing beside Victoria , said quickly , " Clistie toldher she 'd call Judson . Victoria could n't search the woods . " " If it was n't Clistie that screamed , who was it ? " said Thalia . Nobody could answer that . Hollis , nervous and pale , said , " Ihate to call the police . " " Better call them , " said Agnew . " If Victoria was n't dreaming . . .  --  " She may have got ill , you know , " said Bessie suddenly , staring at each of them with her great . haunted eyes , holding herp57coffee cup in both thick jeweled hands . " She may have had a  --  a stroke . A heart attack . " Nobody had thought of that . Clistie was like a tough little hickory nut and was never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telephone . " I suppose we 'll have to call the police . It 's the only way to make a really systematic search . Besides . . . " He shrugged again and called a Ponte Verde number . Everybody listened and watched . So everybody heard him describe , briefly , the situation . Everybody saw him stiffen , listening to the voice at the other end of the wire . And everybody saw the coffee cup he still held fall out of his hand and crash and splinter on the floor . Black coffee splashed all over Bessie 's pink , trailing negligee , but she paid no attention to it . She put her arms around Hollis , who seemed to sag against the wall by the telephone . And , as he listened and said nothing , just stood there , sagging , clutching the telephone , she took it suddenly and strongly away from him . Hollis did n't resist . He turned around and looked at them with blank blue eyes , and said , " They 've found a woman . In the river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's wearing a brown lace dress with a blue ribbon . " Bessie said into the telephone , hoarsely , " How old is she ? What does she look like ? Yes , yes , we 'll come . " Agnew crumpled down on the stairway and began to cry . Thalia said , so softly her voice was like a chill little wind , " Is she dead ? " Hollis , staring at Bessie , did n't seem to hear . Michael put his arm around Victoria . Bessie turned from the telephone . " Oh , yes , " she said , huskily . " She 's dead . She was murdered . But it ca n't be Clistie . They say it 's a young woman , in her twenties . An unidentified woman . Only  --  only they say she 's wearing Clistie 's dress . " Agnew put his head up , choked back a sob and said , " But where is Clistie ? " Nobody could reply to that . Bessie looked all around the hall slowly , at each face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Victoria her dark eyes changed . She said , in an appalled way , " Good Heavens ! And your wedding day tomorrow ! " P58THEY all had to go to Ponte Verde to the police station . Hollis , looking ill and pale , explained it briefly . The unidentified woman had floated downstream toward Ponte Verde where an early fisherman had seen the body . He had rowed near enough to see that it was n't just a brown log , curiously limp , floating along there , turning and twisting sluggishlywith the current . He had towed the body to shore and called the police . This had happened while the men were searchingthe pine woods only a mile or two upstream for Clistie . There had n't been time for an autopsy , but the police were convinced that it was murder . " They  --  they said she was strangled , " said Hollis . " They do n't know who she is , and as soon as they heard about Clistie  --  that is , that a woman was missing here , they said we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " It ca n't be Clistie 's dress , " said Bessie as if debating it with herself . " It 's brown lace with a blue ribbon , but how on earth ... No ! It simply ca n't be Clistie 's dress ! " " Clistie made it herself , " said Thalia softly . " There is n't likely to be another dress just like it . " Nobody said anything for a moment . Perhaps all of them were remembering Clistie 's thin , angular figure in her new brown lace the night before. 58 " She was wearing a dressing-gown when she went downstairs , " said Victoria . " An old green dressing-gown . And turquoise satin evening slippers . " " We 'd better look , " said Michael , " and see if the brown lace dress is still there . " But it was n't . Victoria and Bessie went with him . Clistie 's few clothes were in orderly little ranks in the wardrobe ; each one familiar , nothing added and only the new brown dress was missing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'd better dress and go to Ponte Verde , and insist on the police coming back with us to look for Clistie . " " Are they sure it is n't Clistie they found in the river ? " asked Michael quietly . And Bessie said , shaking her head , " It is n't Clistie . Unless they are color blind . This woman 's blonde . " Michael , sensibly , suggested breakfast . Jody and Ernestine could prepare it while they dressed ; after all , they could n't go to Ponte Verde dressed as they were . " You mean undressed , " said Agnew , with a rather sickly grin . " We look like people in a shipwreck , except Thalia . " The pretenseat a grin failed . He said soberly , " Of course you realize that at any moment Clistie will come walking in with a perfectly sensible reason for being away . " But they had dressed and had a quick breakfast , and were ready to start for the little county seat and still Clistie had not turned up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was far up , of course , by that time . It was a warm , bright day , with the sky blue , and the river bright and sparkling with gold , and the black and white silence of the previous night gone as if it had never been . They went together , with Hollis driving the long town car . At the last moment Bessie had an argument with Agnew , who did n't want to go . " We have to go , " she snapped . " The police want the woman identified . They say we all have to look at her . And if it 's Clistie 's dress . . . " " You ought n't to have admitted Clistie had a dress like that , " said Agnew sulkily . " Why on earth not ! We reported that Clistie was mis-P6o sing . . .. " Bessie lost patience and stamped her high-heeled slipper . " Oh , get in , for Heaven 's sake , Agnew . I do n't want to go any more than you do . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and bring the police back with us to make a real search for her . " The Ponte Verde police station was in one corner of the courthouse . Victoria remembered it all too well . As they drove into the little town and turned the familiar corner , and the small , solid , red-brick courthouse , overgrown with bougainvillaea , rose before them , she had a very unpleasant sensation of repeated experience . They 'd made her come to the courthouse many times during the investigation following Henry 's death . The coroner 's inquest had been held there , too . Michael had the same thing in his mind , for , as the car stopped , he said in her ear , " Brace up , Vicky . It wo n't be like that . " And , as a matter of fact , it was n't . In a queer way , it was worse . For they had to look at the woman who 'd been taken out of the river . But it was n't Clistie . It was a young woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be very light . She was not pretty then ; but she had been pretty only a few hours before ; there were blue marks at her throat . Victoria shut her eyes . There were two or three state troopers in the bare little room ; one of them took her arm in a hard grip . " Do n't faint , " he said . " Just a moment  --  will you look again ? Have you ever seen this woman before ? " " No , " said Victoria . " No . " And immediately was assailed by some fleeting recollection . It was nobody she knew . Yet she had an odd notion that somewhere , not long ago , she had seen her face . She opened her eyes again . And this time she saw the dress the woman was wearing . It too was wet and draggled . But it was Clistie 's dress , or one exactly like it . Limp brown lace and chiffon , torn and wet ; turquoise ribbon , now stained and damp . Oddly , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it Miss Forbes ' dress ? " " Yes . Or one exactly like it . "   " Do any of you know who she is ? " No one did ; at least , no one replied . Agnew looked sick . Hollis , after one quick look , stared out the window and wiped his face with his handkerchief . Thalia , however , looked puzzled . " It seems to me I 've seen her somewhere , " she said , " but I ca n't think where . " " What is her name ? " " But I do n't know , " said Thalia , opening her pansy eyes wide . She saw Hollis and got out her own handkerchief and touched her lips . " It is Clistie 's dress , " said Bessie heavily . " How do you suppose . . . ? " No one answered . " Will you come this way , please , " said the state trooper , and pulled the sheet again over the young , tragic thing on the table and led them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunlight streaming in the windows , and chairs brought for them . Agnew , sitting on the edge of a table at Victoria 's elbow , murmuredunhappily , " Cover her face : mine eves dazzle . She died young . ' " " Sh-sh , " hissed Bessie sharply . " I was only quoting . . . " Here is Mr. Beasley , " said the state trooper . " The State 's Attorney . He would like to ask you a few questions . " " Beasley ! " said Michael . " I thought it was the other fellow . John Campbell . " Beasley , entering , heard it . " John , " he said smiling , " is in the army now . But I 'll endeavor to fill his place . Now then , if you do n't mind answering a few questions ... . The new State 's Attorney was older than John Campbell . He was a thin , dark , suspicious-looking man of fifty or so , whose eyes were remarkably black and sharp in his yellow , malarial face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long face wore the slightly sinister and mournful look of a bloodhound . He questionedthem quickly . When had Clistie disappeared ? When had they last seen her wearing that dress ? Were they sure it was Miss Forbes ' dress ? Did any of them know the girl who 'd been found in the river ?   Thalia said again that she believed she had seen her , perhaps on the street . She was n't sure . " I think I 've seen her , somewhere , too , " said Victoria . " But I do n't know where . " They questioned her about that . And then , at length , about the scream she had heard and her talk with Clistie . About the length of time she had waited for Clistie to return , and about the search for her . It did not actually take very long . Certainly it added little to anybody 's stock of information . It was Clistie 's dress . The dead girl could have been put into the river in the vicinity of the pine woods ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Clistie . Beasley let them go very soon ; a police car , he said , would follow . Obviously the fact that the dead girl was wearing Clistie 's dress augmented his interest in Clistie 's whereabouts . But that was all . " Do n't look like that , Vicky , " said Michael , sitting beside her , on their way home . " It must have been over very quickly  --  poor little kid . " " In our own woods , " said Victoria unsteadily . " So near . . . " There was nothing you could do . Even if  --  well , if she was put into the river along the pine woods , and if she screamed , and that was what you heard  --  it must have been already too late . There was nothing anybody could have done . Here ... . He pushed a handkerchief into her hand . Agnew said crossly and nervously , " She 's not crying . " And Thalia , holding onto her hat , for Hollis was driving very fast , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself and met whoever it was that murdered that girl and he murdered her ... . " Stop that , Thalia ! " said Bessie , sharply . Her eyes looked haunted in their dark , weary pockets . Her hair was an untidy dark wad , her hat was crooked , she still had n't removed her jewelry , and had put on apparently the first clothing that her hands touched , so she was wearing a flowered voile afternoon dress , rather soiled , a raincoat , in spite of the sun and the growing heat , and a black straw hat , which , with the jewelry , looked indescribably dowdy and a little rakish.  |p63The  police car arrived almost as soon as they did . But Clistie had not returned and there had been no word of her . Jody met them at the door and told them . Judson and his two assistants were still looking for her . The four state policemen began to organize a systematic search ; one which ignored the search that had already been made , and began with the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether the police were looking for Clistie or for evidence concerning the murdered girl  --  wearing Clistie 's dress . It was the beginning of a strange and unreal day  --  a day that seemed to have broken loose from the moorings of the customary and comprehensible pattern of other days , and shot off into some nether world of such grotesqueness , of such chaotic and distortedstrangeness that they themselves seemed to partake of that strangeness so nothing they said or did or thought was quite natural and normal . Victoria thought that when she had drifted out onto the terraceand glanced down at the familiar  --  yet that morning unrealand unfamiliar  --  view of the river between the arches of liveoaks and Spanish moss . Beyond the gardens , men were then searching the pine woods  --  working slowly along the banks . Down below her was the pier where Henry had been found that late December morning . Henry who had died in the river , too , as that girl had died  --  who had been wearing Clistie 's dress . And only the day before John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For a moment , a different kind of uneasiness caught at Victoria  --  somethingquite different from her anxiety about Clistie , and the shock of the ugly and tragic sight she had been made to look at in the bare , damp-stained little room of the Ponte Verde courthouse . John Campbell had not only told her , again , that Henry Frame had been murdered ; he had also quite frankly warned her . Not of any specific thing ; not in any way that had seemed , then , credible . But he had warned her ; he had talked of money in a way that seemed to associate his warning with her own inheritance . And then he had said he was sorry he 'd talked to her ; he 'd told her to forget it . But Henry 's death , Clistie 's disappearance , the ugly brutalP64murder of a girl none of them knew , could have no possible connection with each other ! The trip to the Ponte Verde courthouse , the policemen in the house and searching the grounds , had reminded her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followingHenry 's death . That was why , she decided , she kept thinking of him . But the lurking shadow of that new , different uneasiness hovered over her , nevertheless , like a pursuing , ugly bird , its black wings spread . Bessie and Hollis were talking down at the other end of the terrace , where Victoria and Michael had talked the night before . Suddenly it seemed to her that the plans for her wedding and the talk she 'd had with Michael the previous night belonged in an altogether different world , and had nothing whatever to do with her now . But that of course was wrong . She must have a talk with Michael . And explain to Bessie . She crossed the terrace toward Bessie and Hollis , and Hollis was trying to make Bessie understand that he could n't stay at the house and help with the search because he had to get back to camp . Bessie was protesting ; an official leave , limited to hours , meant nothing to her when she wanted Hollis . " I 'll just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll explain to him . I 'll tell him why you ca n't come back to camp . We 're not at war yet . Surely you can break a few rules ! I want to tell him about Clistie , anyway . " It was Agnew eventually who restrained her , while Hollis , consulting his watch , dashed for his own small car and camp . But Bessie telephoned to Colonel Galant anyway . She did not tell the post-commander that one of his soldiers , and a mere private at that , would ( if she 'd had her way ) have overstayed his leave , she did tell him the whole story of the dead girl and Clistie 's disappearance . Victoria , following her into the hall , heard it . " . . , just like that , Bruce . In her green dressing-gown . Walked down the stairs and disappeared . And then that poor dead girl in Clistie 's new dress , and we all had to go to Ponte Verde and tell them it was n't Clistie . No , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IP65knew everybody Clistie knew ; Clistie did n't know that girl . And Victoria thinks she heard the girl  --  well , scream . . . " Bessie 's voice wavered and she went on , " I do wish you 'd come . Bruce , what shall we do ? And there 's the wedding tomorrow . . . " She stopped and listened and finally hung up . " Bruce said he was busy and would rather not talk just nowt But he thinks we ought to postpone the wedding , " she said to Victoria . " Yet if Clistie comes back  --  and she might at any moment , you know . It does seem a pity . After all , it is n't as if we knew that poor girl . " Last night , thought Victoria wearily , she had decided there was to be no wedding . Again it seemed far in the past . Bessie said impatiently , " Really , Victoria , you do n't look as if you 'd heard me . I suppose you 're tired after such a night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's Michael .... " He came in from the driveway , looking hot and tired , and seeingthe quick question in their eyes , shook his head . " No news , " he said . " It 's horribly hot in the woods  --  not a breath of air . " He sat down on the lower step of the stairs and mopped his forehead . Victoria said , " Michael , we were talking about the wed-ding . " He looked at her quickly . " I did n't want to bother you , Vicky . " He stretched out his hand and drew her down to the stair-step beside him . " What about it ? If you do n't want to talk about it now , we wo n't . " Bessie said agitatedly , " But Michael , it 's tomorrow ! If we 're going to postpone it , we 've got to let people know right away . " Bessie , of course , did n't know what Michael really meant . Victoria said slowly , " We were talking of  --  of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Oh , " said Michael . His gray eyes searched her own intently for a moment . Then he said abruptly , " Well , I do n't agree . I think the best thing to do is to put off the people who were invited . I mean , call off the wedding party . But we  --  could be married tomorrow , just the same , Victoria . Quietly  --  only the family and the minister . We could cancel our plans for a trip and stay here until  --  until things are straightened up . That is , if we need to . "   " But Michael , last night ... " began Victoria . Bessie interrupted . " I had n't thought of that , " she said . " I suppose you 're right . We ca n't have people here ; that 's flat . Not unless Clistieifwe only knew , " she ended disjointedly . Michael got up . " I 've got to go back , " he said . " I only came to get a drink and take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Victoria said unsteadily , " But I feel just the same , MichaeL Last night . . . " Today is  --  well , different . " But the situation between them was the same , thought Victoriaunhappily . " No , " she began . " No , Michael . It 's only Clistie . . . " Her voice broke in spite of herself , and she cried , " If anything has happened ... " " If anything has happened , " said Michael . " I 'd like you to be my wife . " He turned to Bessie . " I think that may be the best plan . We 'll see . I 'm going back now . " He said to Victoria , " But it 's up to you . Anything you decide . . . " and went down the hall toward the butler 's pantry . Bessie looked at Victoria worriedly . " What do you think ? " she said . " I do n't know , " said Victoria uncertainly , trying to think , and failing . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still that she did n't love Michael enough to marry him  --  and wished she could . The other was that they ought to have heard from Clistie by then  --  if Clistie was able to communicate with them . She said to Bessie wearily , " Of course we ca n't have people here . If Clistie . . . If we only knew . . . " She stopped as Bessie had stopped . And Bessie said abruptly , " In any case , I 'd better let people know . What a situation ! Really , I do n't know . . . " She hesitated , thinking . " I 'll write one telegram and give it and the list of addresses to the Western Union girl , " she said practically . It gave her something to do . Michael went down to the pine woods again and Bessie sat at the desk , writing telegrams and scratching them out , tapping her large , firm teeth with the pencil . " You ca n't say , ' We do n't want you to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a girl wasp67murdered near the place last night and somebody in the family has disappeared , ' " she said at last irritably to Victoria and Thalia . " You ca n't say , ' On account of all this the marriage will take place as arranged , but we do n't want you or anybody else to come . ' " She shoved her pencil through her thick , untidy hair . " Really , I do n't think there is a precedent for this kind of thing . . . " She broke off abruptly to look toward the hall and listen as the telephone rang . They did that all that strange , long day , for it might be news of Clistie . It was n't , however ; it was a reporter , said Jody , coming to the door . He wanted to ask if it was true that Miss Forbes ' dress had been identified . There was a moment of silence . Then Bessie said , " Already , " with a kind of groan . " Jody , tell him we ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the days following Henry 's death . Bessie said suddenly , " I 'm not going to send any telegrams . Clistie must come back . " " But something 's wrong  --  she would n't stay away like this . Please do send them , Aunt Bessie . " " Nonsense . " Bessie crumpled the papers she 'd been trying this and that phrase upon and thrust them into the wastebasket . " Clistie will come back . You 'll see . " Thalia said , her white eyelids flickering , " You 're going to be married then , Vicky , just as if  --  just the same ? " " No , " said Victoria . Bessie said , " Yes . Unless we  --  have to postpone it . " And Jody , just then , his black face old and wrinkled and tired , came back to announce lunch . A lunch that Clistie had ordered , writing it out in her neat , slanted handwriting . Thalia and Victoria and Bessie ate alone ; neither Michael nor Agnew returned . After lunch , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finding it impossible to sit still and wait , had walked out into the gardens . It was very hot ; the sun beat down warmly upon the roses and the banks of azaleas glowed brilliantlyalong the paths . Through a vista made by path and hedges she saw a car with a man in uniform driving , enter the drive and approach the house . Thinking it was Colonel Galant , she walked quickly along the path to intercept him , but , as she reached the graveled court in front of the house , Major Campbellswung out of the car , saw her and came toward her , his black head , with its rather arrogant lift , shining in the sunlight . " Colonel Galant asked me to stop , " he said . " Is there any news ? " " None . Except  --  that girl this morning . . . He nodded . " The Colonel told me . But you have no direct news of Miss Forbes ? " " No . Clistie would have told me if she meant to leave . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly in his own . " Please do n't worry . Miss Forbes always seemed to me very independent . She would be quite likely to  --  oh , play a lone hand , if she took it into her head to . But she was sensible , too . Remember that . " She said abruptly , " I keep thinking of Henry . And what you told me yesterday . " " I never thought of anything like this , " he said . " I only meant  --  what I said . " " She  --  that dead girl , I mean , could have had nothing to do with Henry 's death . None of us even knew her . " He did n't reply to that . He said instead , rather casually , " Have you searched Miss Forbes ' room for any note or clue to her disappearance ? " It was an obvious step to take . Victoria wondered why none of them had done so . " I will , " she said . He glanced at his wrist watch . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Washington dignitaries I 've got to meet at Ponte Verde and escort to camp and put back on the six o'clock train . Will you please tell Mrs. Isham that Colonel Galant will come as soon as we get rid of our visitors . " He started back toward the waiting car and she walked beside him . The sun beat down hard upon them . The windows of the long house , silent behind their awnings and screens and the bougainvillaea that draped them , were still observant , somehow , like so many eyes . The uniformed boy at the wheel of the car stared straight ahead so rigidly that it only emphasized his rather outstanding ears . Major Campbell opened the car door and paused , his hazelP69eyes narrowed against the bright sunlight . She had put on that morning , quickly , a cool , blue chambray dress ; she had pulled her hair up away from her temples and from the back of her neck and twisted it in a loose knot . Something in Major Campbell 's eyes gave her a sudden inner vision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scuffed white sports shoes , the quick , childish knot of hair . She put her hand to her hair , and he said quickly , " Do n't . . . For a startled , queer instant they looked at each other . Then he said , " I mean  --  you look so  --  so young and . . . " He bit his lip . " What I meant to say is  --  if there 's anything I can do , please let me . " " Thank you . " He got quickly into the car . The slam of the door awoke echoes in the silent , sun-drenched courtyard and apparently brought Thalia to the open front door . When the car had disappeared around a curve of the driveway and Victoria turned toward the house , Thalia was standing in the doorway . She said , " Was n't that John Campbell ? " " Yes . " " Oh , " said Thalia . And again , unexpectedly , Victoria had a fleeting impression of something amused below the velvet tones of Thalia 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lovely dark eyes . It was an odd impression , and it was gone almost as soon as it had come . Thalia 's eyes were all at once wide and candid . She did n't even ask why Major Campbell had come ; she said merely , " I wish Michael and Agnew would come back and tell us if  --  what they are doing . Heavens , it 's hot ! Beasley , the new State 's Attorney , you know , just telephoned to say she is n't in any of the hospitals in the vicinity . They tried every one  --  even as far away as Pine Beach . " Clistie 's room yielded nothing in the way of clues . Victoria searched it at once . There was no note , telling them where she had gone or why ; there was nothing , in fact . Except , gradually , a rather curious impression that the room had already been searched . The dresses were pushed a little awry on their hangers , but early that morning , when they had looked in the wardrobe i:i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been in perfect order , and had been left like that . The blotter on the writing desk was crooked and the paper and envelopes shoved untidily into the pigeonholes . When Victoria looked in the chest of drawers she was sure ; Clistie was , as a rule , as neat as a little brown cat . Now the stacks of underclothing and stockings and sachets were heaped together in frantic disorder . Victoria closed the drawers thoughtfully and went downstairs . But when she asked neither Bessie nor Thalia knew anything of it . " And I do n't think it was the police , " said Bessie , looking puzzled . " They looked in the room , when they were searching the house for Clistie  --  as if we had n't the wits to find her if she was herel  --  but they did n't make that kind of search , I 'm sure . " The men were , then , still searching the pine woods . Particularly they searched the river banks . This took time ; all of it took time . Owing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the stretch of pine woods were irregular , sometimesquite abrupt and high , shelving straight down to the quiet , deep current of the river . The river had cut in here and there against the high banks and had veered unaccountably away at other points . The pine woods were long , too , stretching out over a mile along the river . Altogether it was a difficult place to search , even systematically as they did , dividing it into sections and quartering the sections . They searched more carefully , of course , within hearing distanceof the house . The bank there was not high but it was abrupt ; therefore , they reasoned , if Victoria had heard a splash following the scream , it could have been the splash made by the girl 's body , dropped down into the river which , just there , was deep . There were other , flat , low strips , rush-grown where nothing could have splashed , where the murderer would have had to wade out into the river in order to let the current catch the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that silence , a murderer had crept along in the black shadows , somewhere near the house , while Victoria sat on the balcony . Yet she 'd heard nothing and seen nothing , thought Victoria , in horror , until the scream which she knew was n't part of a dream . Everyone else knew it too , now , whether they admitted it or not . P71Eventually , Michael and Agnew came back with what news there was , which was little enough . The police were not giving up but were working further downstream , toward Ponte Verde . They had found no real clues . The soil was muddy along the banks ; there were pine needles ; many footprints were found in the woods , but most of them were blurred and unclear , probably unidentifiable ; all of those that had retained any clear outline were preserved and marked for , later , a mold . There was no telling when most of them were made ; there had been little rain that spring . Among them , however , were some small marks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them , nothing that could be followed . Eventually , however , a fairly clear mark was found nearthe bank . IFor a hundred feet around it , the bank was marked off for close examination . If the girl had been murdered at that point , her body would have splashed heavily as it was dropped into the river . Victoria on the balcony could have heard both the splash and the scream , for the spot where the heel print was found was not far from the garden hedge . But nothing moved or walked in the gray , shadowy arches of the pine woods , twilight even in daytime , except for patches of light sifting thinly here and there through the Spanish moss . Nothing , that is , except the searchers , for Clistie was not there . By late afternoon they were talking of bloodhounds . And by late afternoon , too , the dead girl was identified . Eliot Beasley himself drove out from Ponte Verde to tell them that , and to question them . He arrived about six . A few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The police were far up the river toward Ponte Verde by that time . Judson and the other men had given up . Agnew and Michael had returned to the house , and the shadows were slantinglong across the garden , when Agnew thought of the pump house . He got up quietly , without speaking to anyone , and went down through the gardens again . The pump house was behind the yew hedge , in a kind of small cave , hollowed out below the garden and plastered with concrete , like a little air-raid shelter . The house had its own water supply , naturally , as it was some distance from any town . It was an artesian well , dug when the house was built , and the water was pumped by a motor and stored . Judson oiled the pump regularly ; everyone else forgot it . They had searched everywhere else . So Agnew , when he remembered it , went down quietly through the garden , turned on the other side of the yew hedge , followed it along the bank of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door , slanting like an old-fashioned cellar door , descended the short flight of damp , cold concrete steps , with the rhythmic murmur of the pump in his ears , and found Clistie.  |p73He  saw the green of her dressing-gown first ; and then the huddle of her thin , horribly inert body against the wall , opposite the pump . There was an electric light bulb swinging over his head , but he did n't turn it on . He had seen enough and he felt sick and dizzy . He knew , he told them later , that she was dead . He turned stumbling , not sobbing this time , and ran to the house , cutting across the formal rosebeds , bursting upon them as they sat on the porch . It seemed to Victoria , then , that they 'd been waiting all that day for the sound of his running feet , heavy across the grass . For the look in his white face . Bessie 's hands went to her breast and her lips moved . Agnew cried in a thin , high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I found her . She 's in the pump house . . . Jody had a pitcher of iced tea in his hand , and he was going to drop it . Victoria watched it shake and tremble in his shriveled black hand . Michael was at Agnew 's side , his hand on Agnew 's shoulder . " Is she alive ? " The look on Agnew 's face seemed to answer him . He whirled around . " Jody , telephone to the police ; get Judson up here , too . I 'll go down . Agnew , is she ... ? " Agnew , shivering , said between his teeth , " She 's dead . I know she 's dead . She 's against the wall .... " " I 'll go , " said Michael , and ran , as Agnew had done , across the formal beds , toward the yew hedge and the pump house . Agnew , rubbing his arm over his eyes , followed him and Victoriamust have moved to go , too , for Bessie caught her arm . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her lips gray . " Do n't go  --  it ca n't help . If she 's dead ... " Jody had got the big glass pitcher safely placed on a table . He turned around and ran back into the house . Thalia said , " Where 's the pump house ? Did n't the police look in the pump house ? Did n't Judson look ? " Her small face turned white and sharp all at once , and she said in a kind of scream , " Was she murdered ? Like that girl  --  murdered ... " All at once the cook , old fat Ernestine in starchy white , was there , and Lilibelle , one of the little colored maids , in equally starchy gray  --  rolling her eyes widely , shocked and frightened .   Ernestine put her fat , comforting arm around Victoria . Bessie said unevenly , " Thalia , stop that noise ! Lilibelle , you tell Jody to telephone for Judson . Tell him to telephone the camp too and ask for Colonel Bruce and tell him I 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 've got to tell Hollis . I 've got to  --  a doctor , too , " she cried loudly , her breath coming in stertorous gasps . " Maybe she 's not dead . Lilibelle , wait ; tell Jody to call the doctor , first . Dr. Theobald . Jody will know . " Lilibelle ran into the house again . Victoria said stiffly , " If she 's dead , Bessie , the doctor ca n't do anything . " She shook off Ernestine 's arm and started across the garden . The pump house , of course . She had n't thought of it ; nobody , then , had thought of it . Not even Judson . He took care of the pump ; but nobody ever thought of the pump house or its inconspicuous , greenpainteddoor . Why had Clistie gone there ? Michael was running across the garden again , toward her , his face drained of color . He caught her by the shoulders . " You ca n't go down there . " " Michael , is she dead ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Victoria felt herself sway against his hands ; he put both arms around her . " She 's been dead , I think , for at least all day . Victoria , you 'll have to know . Perhaps you 've been expecting it  --  since that girl this morning . . . " " Was Clistie murdered ? " " I 'm afraid so . " Agnew suddenly was beside her also , his face rigid and white . Somebody was crying . It was Bessie , in loud vehement sobs . Then they were on the porch again  --  the wide porch with its gay wicker chairs and its beautiful view of the river . The sun was low , the sky tranquil and clear and reflecting itself in the river . Michael must have led her to a chair . Ernestine was crying , too , her white apron over her head . Jody was in the doorway , trying to make Bessie understand something he was saying about Colonel Galant , and just then Colonel Galant himself came out from the house . " I just drove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tells me ? " A tall , lanky man with a long yellow face had apparently arrived at the same time and was questioning Jody as if he had aP75right to . Then she recognized him ; it was the man who had questionedthem that morning ; the new State 's Attorney , Eliot Beasley . She wondered dimly how he had got there so soon . But Clistie was dead . Clistie was dead . Like that girl in Clistie 's dress . Colonel Galant came to bend over her . His face was kind and worried . " Vicky , Vicky , my dear . . . " He was patting her hands , comforting her . He straightened to his full , spare height and told Jody to bring brandy . Michael and the State 's Attorneywere talking . Suddenly the men were moving again toward the garden , toward the forgotten little pump house whose very existence no one had remembered . No one except Clistie . Why had Clistie gone there ? And what had happened ? Bessie was crying and stopping to wipe her eyes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and still . Agnew was hunched on a bench , alone on the grassy slope below them as if he could n't bear to be with anybody . They 'd waited all that day . Well , now they knew . It did n't seem very long , really , until the men came back again from the garden , their faces very sober . Bessie saw them coming and rose . They trudged along , heavily , as if they carried a weight on their shoulders . The State 's Attorney 's yellow face was like a mask ; he said nothing to Bessie , who stood directly in his path , but went around her and asked Jody to take him to the telephone . Colonel Galant wiped his face with his handkerchief and sat down on the divan . " I 'm afraid it 's true , " he said to Bessie . " It  --  I 'll have some of that brandy , Michael . " It stood on the table with the big pitcher of iced tea . Michael poured some for the Colonel which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was unsteady , and he set the decanter down loudly . The Colonel said , with an apologetic glance at Bessie , " It 's been so horribly hot today . I  --  I was n't prepared for . . . " " Bruce , was she murdered ? " said Bessie harshly , her great eyes showing white rims . " Was she murdered ? Like that poor girl this morning ? " " Yes , Bessie . Strangled , " said the Colonel , and drank his brandy quickly . Victoria put her hands over her eyes to shut out something that really she had not seen . Michael put down the glass he held and came to her . " Bruce , who killed her ? " cried Bessie loudly . " Nobody would kill Clistie . What happened ? " " I do n't know , Bessie . She  --  that 's all I know . She 's there in the pump house . This man  --  the State 's Attorney , whatever his name is  --  thought she 'd been there probably since last night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Michael in Victoria 's ear . " Come with me . Quick  --  before he gets back . " He took her arm and led her down upon the path , away from the porch . Bessie 's voice rose loudly behind them . " I must have Hollis . I must let Hollis know at once . Oh , Bruce , Bruce , could n't she have committed suicide ? Henry committed suicide . Maybe Clistie committed suicide ... " " No , " Bruce Galant 's voice sounded loud , too . " No , Bessie . She did n't kill herself . " Michael took Victoria 's hands urgently . " Victoria , listen , " he said quickly , his voice low . " It 's been a shock , I know . I wish I could have kept you from knowing like  --  like this . But I  --  Victoria , that man Beasley , the State 's Attorney , is going to question you . You and me and all of us , for that matter . " A door closed . Michael glanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What I wanted to say is this : when he questions you , do n't admit anything . Do you understand ? " " You mean it will be like  --  like Henry 's death . " " It 's murder , Victoria . " " You 're afraid they 'll suspect me , again . As it was when Henry died . But I  --  I did n't  --  I could n't have . . . Clistie . . . " I know , Victoria . But remember , ask for a lawyer . Do n't let Beasley trap you into saying anything you do n't mean . We 'd better go back . . . " They turned back toward the porch . Beasley was watching them . His yellow face long and lined , his black eyes bright under heavy yellow eyelids . He wore a wrinkled white linen suit and a pale yellow tie which seemed to match the ugly pallor of his long , heavy face with its pendulous lips . He watched them ; he watch Thalia and Bessie and the Colonel and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the wide porch , that the police and the coroner were on their way . " I 'm not a coroner , " he said , jerking his purplish lips over yellow , long teeth in a kind of grin , " as my predecessor was . 1 expect you all remember him very well . If I 'm not mistaken , it 's only been nine or ten weeks since "  --  he looked all around with his black eyes sparkling beneath those wrinkled yellow eyelids  --  " since Henry Frame was murdered . " Bessie said heavily , her face shocked and flabby , " Since Henry committed suicide . " " It was suicide , Mr. Beasley , " said Colonel Galant . " That was the coroner 's jury verdict . Surely you knew that . " " Yes , " said Beasley , " I knew . " Colonel Galant flashed a startled , comprehensive glance at Beasley . " Then exactly what do you mean ? " said Michael . " Murder , " said Beasley . " Of course . " " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed , " said Colonel Galant . " It 's reopened now , " said Beasley . " Now , then ... " " But that 's impossible ! " cried Bessie , staring . " None of us even knew that girl ! It has nothing whatever to do with Henry . Mr. Beasley , who murdered Clistie ? What happened ? Can we  --  can we bring her into the house ? It does n't seem decent to leave her  --  like that .... " " Sorry , " said Beasley . " I ca n't do anything till our coroner arrives . Except  --  well , I came out from Ponte Verde just now to ask you a question or two . If you do n't mind .... " Thalia put a dainty , lacy handkerchief to her eyes . The Colonel uttered a protesting but helpless murmur . Bessie seemed to gather her strength together , as one braces muscles . She lifted dark , white-rimmed eyes toward Beasley . " Why , certainly , if you must , " she said . " You must understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frightful shock . If you could give us a little time . . . " " I 'm so very sorry , Mrs. Isham . Do you know anyone named Joan Green ? " It put a kind of period to the whole ugly scene . P78Bessie leaned forward , her face slack . She tried to get up , and fell clumsily and slackly , half over the chair , half on the floor . One foot , absurdly small in a high-heeled pump such as Bessie always wore , scuffed up the grass rug . They carried her into the drawing room and put her on a couch ; she was n't unconscious for more than a moment or two ; she insisted on walking upstairs to her own room . The doctor , their own family doctor , whom Jody had summoned , arrived a few moments later and said she was to stay in her room ; she 'd had a severe shock . No one was to question her yet . Hollis arrived shortly after , and the police again , and the coroner . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pump house with the coroner and the police and came back after a long time , his face very grave . He told Victoria to stay with Bessie . " It 's a bad business , " he said , shaking his head . he was a little , stocky man with a pointed gray beard and rather popped eyes . He looked doubtfully at Victoria . " I 'll tell you this , " he said suddenly . " Clistie could n't have had more than a  --  a few seconds . If the pressure exerted is hard enough , and just at the right place , against these arteries "  --  he put his stubby hands against his own neck , one on each side  --  " it does n't take more than a few seconds . It cuts off the blood supply to the brain , you know . You lose consciousness at once . " He stopped abruptly . " Do n't look like that , my dear . It 's  --  it 's a bad business . " He shook his head again and trotted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's gone , has he ? " she said . " Vicky , has Hollis come ? Has Hollis come , Vicky ? " He had arrived , but had gone down to the pump house . And when he returned to the house and came to his mother 's room , Bessie sent Victoria away . " I want to talk to Hollis , " she said . " Hollis , come here . " Passing Victoria on the way into the room , Hollis gave her hand a quick , comforting squeeze . He looked white and frightened , younger , more like Agnew . He stopped at the footP79of his mother 's bed and gripped the railing tightly , rather defiantly , Victoria thought , as she closed the door . The house , on the second floor at least , was quiet . Downstairsthere was a kind of subdued hubbub  --  footsteps , the hum of men 's voices , the ringing of the telephone . It was like the time following Henry 's death . Henry 's murder , Beasley had said . As John Campbell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin , blonde girl none of them knew . Victoria went to her room . From the windows she could see men  --  police in uniform , Beasley , a little man she recognized as the county sheriff  --  cross the garden toward the pump house and return . She left the window and went out on the balcony ; but in the growing twilight the river looked secretive and strange , as if it , and the house and garden and even themselves , she thought suddenly , had changed  --  had undergone a swift and sinister metamorphosis . Murder . A long time later , for it was dark and the moon was out bright and white again , Jody brought her some soup and sandwiches on a tray and coaxed her to eat them . " What are they doing ? " " I do n't know , Miss Vicky . They talking mostly . Mr. Hollis and Mr. Michael and the Colonel . Mr. Agnew , he sick and went to bed . Miss Thalia , she ate a good dinner . Lots of people downstairs  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time when Mr. Frame died . " He avoided her eyes , set the tray down and started away . She stopped him . " Jody , who do they think killed her ? Is there any  --  any evi-dence ? " His eyes roved around the room , everywhere but toward her . " I do n't know , Miss . You eat your soup , " he said , and went away quickly , as if afraid she would call him back . She could n't eat ; she returned to the balcony ; it was night again ; there were lights glancing about the garden down there toward the pump house , beyond the thick yew hedge . She was thinking of Clistie when they sent for her . Jody came , P8o again , to tell her . Obviously he hated asking her to go downstairs and talk to the police ; he felt sorry for her , she could see that , and he saw that she 'd been crying . She washed her face with cold water and brushed back her hair . Her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jody down the stairs where Clistie had descended the night before , while Victoria stood and watched her and had no premonition that that was the last time . The library was lighted and there was a high-backed chair at the long table in the middle of the room , with the light from above shining brightly down upon it . Men were waiting there . But not Michael , not Colonel Galant , not even Hollis , whose face would have been friendly . Instead there were two state policemen in uniform , standing back in the shadows , the State 's Attorney , Eliot Beasley , sitting at the end of the table but outside the rim of light so the direct glare was not upon him , and two other men in civilian clothing  --  the county sheriff and a stenographer , with a ruled pad of paper on his knee . Then she saw John Campbell , in uniform , standing at one of the windows , his back to the room . As she entered , he turned , saw her , and made a quick move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , Miss Steane . Over here , please . " Major Campbell stopped , folded his arms and stood before the window . She moved forward slowly and then saw something on the table . It was the only object on the table which had been swept bare of its usual clutter of books and ashtrays and flowers . And it was a thin , red leather belt with a small gilt buckle . It was a belt that belonged to her ; it went on a white , tailored silk dress with red buttons . It was a queer place for her belt to be . The State 's Attorney said in a rasping voice : " I see you recognizethat belt , Miss Steane . It belongs to you , does n't it ? Do sit down . No  --  here , in this chair . " She sat down , staring at the belt which looked lithe and thin , coiled there under the light like a small scarlet snake . " That , " said Eliot Beasley , " was around Clistie Forbes ' neck when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The state police had shed their tunics and were wearing brown shirts . Beasley had taken off his white-linen coat and pulled his collar open and his long , yellow face glistened . The windows were open but not a breath of air stirred the heavy draperies . The light pouring down on her face was hot too . But that scarlet , thin belt could n't have been around Clistie 's neck ! She was sitting upright in the high-backed chair , hands tight on the carved arms . The polished , bare surface of the table reflectedthe glaring light from above  --  only the coiled , sinuous red belt broke the reflection . She moistened her lips . Beasley said , " It is your belt ? " " I  --  I do n't know . . . " Whoever murdered the girl in the pine woods could n't have entered the house , Victoria thought dazedly . If somebody the girl knew , somebody who 'd wanted to murder her , who had met her in the pine woods and killed her there and dropped her little , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been intercepted by Clistie so that , terrified and shaking with the dreadful thing he had just done , he had felt that he had to kill Clistie , too  --  if all that had happened ( and it was the only logical explanation for Clistie 's murder ) then how had he got Victoria 's little scarlet belt ? P82Beasley said , " Look here , Miss Steane , you may as well understand this : I 'm going to break this case and I 'm going to do it quickly . The sooner you and everybody else understands that the better for everybody . Now then . That belt was twisted around Clistie Forbes ' neck when we found her . Undoubtedly it was the weapon of murder . I examined the marks on that dead girl 's throat ; we 'll have experts look at it later . But I 'm sure now , anybody would be sure who looked at it , that the belt could have been used to strangle that girl . And then removed and used to murder Clistie Forbes , too . What have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I do n't know anything about it ! I do n't understand how anybody could have come into the house and taken the belt . It . . . There must be some mistake . . . . " " But it is your belt ? " Michael had told her not to admit anything . Yet anybody could have told Beasley that she had a red belt like that one . She said , " I  --  I have one like it . " " So I 'm told . And your maid says it 's not in your dressing room . I sent her to look while you were with your aunt . There 's no use , you see , in trying to evade . This is your belt . Now then when did you last see it ? " She tried to think back . The slim strip of red leather was horribly fascinating ; it looked as if it might move . She made herself look at Beasley , and his sparkling black eyes had a triumphant glitter . " I do n't know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Beasley glanced at the stenographer who was making jerky marks on the tablet he held . " You do n't remember . Miss Steane , how long have you known Joan Green ? " " Joan . . . " That was the name he 'd asked Bessie about , and Bessie had fainted  --  not , Victoria had thought , because of the name , but rather from what the doctor had called delayed shock . " I do n't know anybody by that name . " " Oh , you do n't know anybody by that name . You 've been at Camp Blakoe frequently , have n't you ? "  | " Yes . " But Camp Blakoe ( and Joan Green ) had nothing to do with Clistie . " So I understood . You know quite a number of the officers and their wives , do n't you ? " " Yes , I suppose I do . Mr. Beasley , this has nothing to do with Clistie 's death . . . " " You know Colonel Galant very well , do n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been in his office occasionally during the building and organization of the camp . Have n't you ? " " Why , I  --  yes , I suppose so . " ' You suppose so . " Beasley glanced sharply at the stenographer as if to be sure he had written her answer . Major Campbell had n't moved . Beasley said , " His office is in the administration building , is n't it ? But you do n't know Joan Green ? " " No . Is that the dead girl ? Has she been identified ? " " ' Is that the dead girl ! ' Yes , Miss Steane . " Beasley 's voice was sharp with sarcasm . " Yes , Miss Steane , that is the dead girl . Joan Green . She has been identified . She worked at the administrationbuilding . Her desk was in the outer office , connecting the Quartermaster 's office and Colonel Galant 's . You had to pass her desk every time you went to Colonel Galant 's office . She took the telephone calls for both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time you telephoned to Colonel Galant . She was at the Colonel 's tea party yesterday and you were there , too . But when you saw her this morning , dead , you did n't know her . Oh , no . You only thought her face was familiar . Sit down , please . " Victoria had started to rise ; she sank down into the chair again . " But there were so many people , " she said , slowly . " The camp is so big . I do n't remember stopping at Colonel Galant 's office more than once or twice . If she was there I do n't remember her . I do though , now , remember seeing her at the tea party . " That was why the dead girl 's face had been faintly familiar . She remembered her , suddenly  --  standing beside Bessie , taking a cup of coffee and moving away . It had been just as Major Campbell approached and spoke to her .   " Oh , you remember her , now , do you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many people who can prove that you have seen her many times ! " Major Campbell 's figure moved a little forward . Victoria said , " It 's true , exactly as I told you . I did n't know where I had seen her until you spoke of Colonel Galant 's tea . Then I knew . " John Campbell had stopped ; his voice came from the shadows . " Have you any proof to the contrary , Eliot ? " Beasley shrugged , shot a quick glance toward John Campbell and said , " No . Not yet , and you know it . " There was a short silence . Beasley 's long yellow fingers were tapping the polished surface of the table . Major Campbell 's tall , uniformed figure , just at the edge of her vision , moved back again quietly into the window embrasure . Beasley leaned forward and continued with an air of frankness and a stretching of his thick , purplish lips that went for an ingratiating smile . " Well , Miss Steane , let 's forget Joan Green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say you heard a scream ; you say you thought someone was being hurt ; you say it seemed to come from the pine woods . You say that you ran out into the hall and called Miss Forbes and Agnew Isham . At least that was your statement this morning when I talked to you ? Do you want to change it ? " " No . That is what happened . " " Do you want to add to it ? " " That is all there is to tell . " " Really , " said Beasley . " Oh , I think not quite all . For instance , why did you call a boy of eighteen when there were men in the house ? Why did you tell Miss Forbes that you had heard something in the pine woods , and then let her go alone and unaccompanied to investigate ? Why did n't you go with her or send someone with her ? " " I meant to call Hollis , " said Victoria . " But I made a mistake and opened the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rooms are beside each other . And I called Clistie because ... ' She knew her voice wavered and she made herself speak steadily . " Because we always called Clistie . She always saw to things . That 's why I let her go downstairs and , when she told me to , Ip85went back to my room . She said she was going to telephone to Judson  --  that 's the gardener . She  --  all of us did what Clistie told us to do . We always have . If I 'd known  --  if I 'd dreamed ... " Her voice wavered again , and this time she had to stop . There was a brief silence , with the light pouring down into her eyes and reflecting itself upward from the bare table , so wherever she looked there was a glare . Beasley said , " Whom did you call first , Agnew , or Miss Forbes ? " " Agnew  --  well , as a matter of fact , I went to Clistie 's room first . But she was n't there and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I called her  --  I think I called her  --  anyway , I started toward Hollis ' room and opened the door to Agnew 's room instead , and woke him . Then as we went into the hall , to call Hollis , there was Clistie . She 'd put on her dressing gown and she still had on her turquoise satin slippers . " " Was she wearing the brown lace dress then ? " broke in the State 's Attorney . " I do n't know . I  --  why , no , I 'm sure she was n't wearing it under the dressing gown for I remember noticing her slippers . The dressing-gown was n't as long as the dress would have been ; it came about to her ankles . No , I 'm sure she was n't wearing it then . " Again Major Campbell 's voice came from the window embrasure . " What was she wearing when she was found ? I do n't remember that anyone told me . " " Dressing-gown , underclothing . No dress . Stockings . Blue satin slippers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? What happened to it ? " Beasley looked irritated . " If I knew that , John , I 'd know why she was wearing the Forbes woman 's dress  --  which is more than I know now . Go on , Miss Steane . What happened then ? " " It 's as I told you this morning . She asked what was wrong , and I told her . She said she 'd call Judson and see to it and sent me to bed , and Agnew . She said she 'd come back and tell me  --  but she did n't come . And then . . . " Then you and Agnew called Hollis Isham and Bayne andP86roused the house to look for her . But what about this scream ? What time did you hear it ? " " I 'm not sure . It was around midnight , I think . " " Ca n't you be more specific ? " " It was a little after eleven when I went out on the balcony . I was there a long time . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was nearly two , and Agnew thought she had been gone about an hour . I must have heard the scream about twelve-thirty . Perhaps a little later . " He glanced at the stenographer . " What time did Hollis Isham and Miss Frame say they returned from the movies ? " The stenographer flipped back pages . The little , quiet county sheriff got out his handkerchief and mopped his round face . She remembered that he had been like that after Henry 's death  --  an unobtrusive figure , appearing and disappearing with no explanation , yet adding a kind of passive weight of officialdom to the inquiry . The stenographer stopped flipping pages . " Here it is , Mr. Beasley . Shall I read it ? ' Question : What time did you return ? Answer : I 'm not sure ; a little after twelve , I suppose . ' That 's Mr. Isham . And Miss Frame says . . . " He paused to turn anotherpage . " Miss Frame says , ' It was ten minutes , almost exactly , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All right . Now , Miss Steane , did you know they had re-turned ? " " I heard a car I supposed was Hollis ' car . " " You did n't see either Hollis or Miss Frame ? " " No . " " But it was after that you heard the famous scream ? " " Yes . " " How long after ? " " Perhaps  --  a quarter of an hour . I ca n't say exactly . " He drummed on the table again for a moment , thoughtfully . " And you sent Clistie Forbes to see what was wrong and an hour later you ' realized you must look for her . ' It took you rather a long time , " said Beasley , again sarcastic . He was right , though . If only they had not been so dependent upon Clistie , so assured of her efficiency and so blindly , childishly obedient ! MajorP87Campbell stirred uneasily in the shadow by the window . Beasley said , " Did anybody else hear that scream ? " " No . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say ? " " It just seemed to me so loud and  --  and shrill . I thought everyone must have heard it . " " But in point of fact no one else did . The night was very quiet too . You 're sure , Miss Steane , that someone screamed ? " " Yes . I was n't dreaming . . . " Something moved in his eyes ; she stopped , and after an instant said slowly , " You did n't mean that I was dreaming . " " No , Miss Steane , I 'm afraid that is n't what I meant , " said Beasley , stretching his lips over his teeth . He leaned forward so his long hand reflected itself in the surface of the table and the reflection looked exactly like a yellow , grasping claw . He said , " I told you I was going to break this case and do it quickly . Now , I 've already questioned other people in the house : Miss Frame , Mr. Bayne , Hollis and Agnew Isham , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture is n't clear ; there 's no use pretending it is . " He paused , and Victoria thought , queerly , with a kind of surprise : but he 's honest . He was suspicious , clumsily sarcastic  --  with sparkling , hateful black eyes . But honest . He said , " I suggest , Miss Steane , that there could have been no scream , for you alone heard it . I suggest that your story could have been only a ruse to get Miss Forbes out of the house . I suggest that this dead girl could have been dressed in Miss Forbes ' dress merely in a desperate intent to confuse us . It would have been something a woman would think of . I do n't know why Joan Green came here , or why she was murdered . So far  --  I 'm being perfectly frank with you  --  I know only that Joan Green was a quiet , hard-working girl . She came from a little town near here , where she had lived with an aunt . She 'd learned shorthand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time when she got a job at Camp Blakoe last winter while it was being built . She had a room in a hotel in Ponte Verde . That 's all , so far , that I know about her . But that 's not the point . " He was leaning far over the table now , shaking his long hand at her . It was so still in the room that no one seemed to breathe . He said , " It was your belt , Miss Steane . You  --  and this boy  --  were the last to see Clistie Forbes . You sent her out into the night . You . . . Major Campbell came toward the table . " I think you 're going pretty far , Eliot . " Beasley 's long thin body twisted around . " It 's my case , John , not yours . Although . . . " He smiled . " Well , no , " he said . " I 'm not so sure but what it is your case . Or was your case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was another silence in the hot room . Then Major Campbell said , " Exactly what is the connection ? " " I do n't know yet . But mark my words , there is one . The Frame case is opened again , automatically . No doubt in anybody'smind now that he was murdered . So there 's a triumph for you , my boy . You always insisted he was the kind of man somebody would murder . " There was another short silence before Major Campbell said , " I believed he was murdered , yes . But what about evidence ? " " Evidence of murder in the Frame case ? " " Evidence of that , and evidence linking it to the murders last night . " Beasley thrust out his lower lip and put his head on one side , judicially . " Concrete evidence , none . I doubt if we shall have any further evidence on the Frame case . But the big link is simply murder . " His long hand dropped to his knee , his thick eyelids lowered over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy . There was never anything truer said . " He chuckled a little and said almost gloatingly , " I 'll tie up your case for you , John . Besides there 's the important question of motive . Suppose this Forbes woman knew who murdered Frame . Suppose . . . " He checked himself abruptly , his eyes glittering yet secretive . " It 's my luck to step in after you 've gone out and wind up your famous unsolved murder . The Beasley luck , " he said , and chuckled . Major Campbell 's face did n't change ; nevertheless , a kind of shutter seemed to have closed over it , and whatever he was thinking . He reached inside his coat and got out a package ofp89cigarettes . His brown belt glowed dully in the light as he struck a match . " Nevertheless , Eliot , I think you 'd better let Miss Steane go now . She 's had rather a bad time ; you ca n't get much out of a  --  a hysterical witness , " said Major Campbell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I can get a confession . . . " I doubt it . " " But my God , John , you thought she murdered Frame ! " Michael had said , ask for a lawyer . Victoria got up . Campbell said , " I did n't prove it ; remember that , too . " Then he saw that she was rising and came toward her . Victoria put her hands on the table . " I 'm going to have a lawyer , " she said . " I refuse to answer any more questions now . " The small scarlet belt was so near her hand it almost touched it . It was Major Campbell who broke the silence . " She 's quite within her right , of course , Eliot , " he said . " Besides  --  well , you can let her go for tonight , ca n't you ? " " I 'll not have you interfering , you know , John , " said Beasley softly . " I let you in on this tonight because you asked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go . " Major Campbell opened the door for her , his brown face and bright hazel eyes inscrutable . He said nothing ; there was no way to know whether he was a friend or an enemy . Certainly he had seemed , once or twice , to defend her ; yet obviously it was his case against her , after Henry Frame died , that led Beasley to suspect her now . For , obviously again , if the motive for Clistie 's murder was some knowledge she possessed about Henry 's death , then Clistie 's murderer was also Henry 's murderer . But she had n't murdered Henry  --  or Clistie . If Clistie had known that Henry was murdered , and had evidence leading to the murderer , she would have told the police , long ago . And Beasley 's theory left out Joan Green altogether . Yet there was her red belt . How could Clistie 's murderer have got possession of it ? Had he crept into the house  --  big , rambling , frequently left unlocked  --  found his way secretly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen ? But then who ?   And why go to such pains when a rope from the garage would have done as well ? The library door closed . Michael was waiting , sitting on the stairway , an ashtray beside him full of cigarette ends . Thalia was there , too , sitting on the step above him . She was wearing the blue silk housecoat again and looking very pretty . " Oh , Vicky , " she said quickly , getting up . " We 've been waiting . Was it very bad ? Of course , we knew about the belt  --  they asked everybody whose it was . Vicky , I sent the telegrams about the wedding . I got the list from Bessie . I . . . " She hesitated , her eyes very soft and dark and yet rather watchful under her long , soft eyelashes . " I did n't know what to say and you were in your room and so upset about Clistie , that I did n't  --  want to bother you . But I knew you could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telegrams it was postponed ; I could n't think of anything else to say . I do hope that was right . Poor darling , you look simply dead . " She paused for an instant . And a spark of something knowing and queerly speculative moved in her dark eyes , and she said gently , " Was John Campbell very difficult ? " " No , " said Victoria shortly . Looking directly into Thalia 's eyes , she found nothing secret , nothing amused , only sympathy . " My God , I thought they 'd never let you go , " said Michael , putting his arm around her . " Vicky , darling , we 'll get a lawyer right away . " He went upstairs with her . Thalia followed and went into Bessie 's room . Ernestine was waiting for Victoria ; fat old Ernestine with her troubled , faithful eyes . Hot milk was on the bed table . " She 's got to go to bed now , Mr. Michael , " she said . " Come , Miss Vicky . Ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let Victoria tell Michael what Beasley had said . Michael listened in silence , holding her tight in his arms . " It 'll be all right ; you 'll see , " he said quietly . " We 'll get at the truth . We did it before . Vicky , is there anything you 've forgotten ? Anything about Clistie ? " " Now , Mr. Michael , " said Ernestine . " Miss Vicky 's done up . Such a wedding day tomorrow ! With Miss Clistie . . . " Scowlingand troubled , she stopped . 11P91Michael said , " It was all right for Thalia to send telegrams saying that the wedding was postponed ; but we 'll be married anyway . Right , Vicky ? " He paused and said , " Vicky , I do n't believe you 've understood a word I 've said . Put her to bed , Ernestine . Good night , dear . " Ernestine closed the door after him . " Now , now , " said Ernestine . " Drink your milk . Hold up your arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her loving old hands were more adept than the most skillful of French maids . Victoria did n't remember Ernestine leaving the room . She did n't even remember putting down the glass of hot milk . Agnew awakened her . It was very late , the squares of moonlight on the carpet had traveled , slanting , across it . Agnew was sitting on the bed , tuggingat her arm . She awoke and for a fractional instant did not remember what had happened . It was merely Agnew wandering the house at night , owl-like , as he often did . She could see him clearly in the reflected light . " Toothache ? " she said sleepily . And then remembered and sat up , " What 's wrong ? Agnew ... " " Sh  --  sh  --  do n't yell ! Nothing 's wrong . I just wanted to  --  to talk . . . " He hesitated . He 'd put on a winter bathrobe , hotlookingand woolly ; his spectacles glimmered as he turned his head . " Vicky , why do you suppose Clistie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back in her awareness now ; the weight and the horror . " I do n't know . I wondered , too . There 's nothing there . . . " No . Vicky , I 'm going down there . " " Agnew , you 're not ! " she said sharply . " There must be something  --  some clue . . . " " But Agnew , you ca n't . . . " She thought quickly , seeking a reason with which to dissuade him . " The police have already been there . They would n't overlook anything .... " " Yes , but why did she go there ? And in the morning the police will be everywhere under foot again and I do n't believe any of them are around tonight . I 've got a flashlight . " With despair she recognized his arguing tone . It meant that nothing short of dynamite would sway him . She got up and reached for a dressing-gown . " What are you going to do ? " he whispered quickly . " Tell Hollis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Vicky , " he said , " if you tell him and get him to stop me , I'llnever tell you another thing in my life . I mean it . " He did mean it . There was a pause . He tugged the flashlight out of his pocket and turned toward the door . " Wait , " she said and fumbled for slippers . " I 'm going too . " " No . Vicky , I wo n't let you .. . " I go or tell Hollis . Take your choice . " There was another silence while she tied the long crimson sash on her dressing-gown . Then he said crossly , " All right . Come on . . . " The house was quiet . There was a small light above the stairway ; the rooms downstairs were dark . They crossed the drawing room , groping their way , and let themselves out the side door , very quietly . They crossed the porch and Agnew caught her wrist and whispered , " Follow the shadow of the hedge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But they crossed the garden and still no one stopped them . The tall yew hedge made a wide black shadow at the end of it . There was a gap in the hedge there ; Agnew let Victoria precede him . On the other side of the hedge the moonlight fell full and strong upon them . Nothing moved in the moonlit strip between the hedge and the deep shadow of the pine woods . Why had Clistie gone down the stairs  --  and instead of calling Judson , crossed the garden , walked along the hedge , entered the little , forgotten pump house ? And then been killed . But it had been a mistake to come ; they 'd better go back to the house  --  back through the still , white moonlight , back along those shadowy paths . Agnew whispered in her ear , " What 's the matter ? " " We 're going back . This was a crazy idea . " " Maybe it was , " admitted Agnew . " But now we 're this far . . . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I do n't much like it myself . It 's so darnedP93white and black and  --  and still . . . But it 's not much fur-ther . " " But there ca n't be anything there . I mean anything that would explain ... " " All right , go on back , then ! " snapped Agnew fretfully . " But I 'm going on . " He went ahead . The moonlight was bright and everything was quiet . Not even a bird moved in the black depths of the pine woods . The night before , if the police were right , Joan Green had been in those woods . A murderer had walked quietly in those black depths . Nothing moved there now ; the police had combed the place . Still she 'd been wrong to come and to bring Agnew with her . She followed his tall , bathrobed figure which was clearly outlined in the moonlight . He was carrying the flashlight in one hand . They moved again into the deep black shadow made by some shrubs which were planted thickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could barely see Agnew , but she could hear him tug the door upward . She could n't see the steps ; he was fumbling with the catch of his flashlight . " Go ahead , Vicky , " he said . " If this thing 's out of batteries . . . " She groped for the edge of the steps and started down them . Agnew was muttering impatiently and clicking the catch of the flashlight . She could n't see anything below her , but now she could touch rough , cold , concrete wall on both sides of the steps . She went down a few more steps , nerving herself to take each one . The pump was n't running ; it was perfectly still and quiet except that Agnew , above , seemed to be having difficulty finding the steps , scuffling his feet and bumping against the door . She turned around and said , " Agnew  --  where are you ? " And the lighted , luminous sky directly above and the nearer black shadow of shrubs were blotted out . All at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrown over them  --  but a curtain that came down with a thud . She cried , " Agnew  --  why did you drop the door ? Where 's the light ? " Agnew was coming softly down the stairs in the thick , damp , darkness , but he did n't answer .   " Agnew ... " she said again . And stopped . The footsteps stopped too . Suddenly she knew it was n't Agnew . P95WHOEVER was in the pump house did not answer . And must have heard her voice . She could remember very little about the pump house . It was small , built around a pump which was run by electricity , and a tank for the storage of water ; there was only one way to get in or out of it , and that was by the steps . That was all she knew of it . And with the blotting out of that rectangle of luminous sky , she was n't sure , even , where the steps were . She was in a bewildering , damp , black space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why did n't he open the door again and come down the steps ? It was perfectly black and perfectly still . But someone was there , in that black little cave , and it was n't Agnew , and she was caught exactly like a rat in a trap . And anyone in the family , any of the servants , would have recognized her voice . Would have spoken . She must move ; do something  --  anything  --  not stand there frozen , rigid , waiting for the trap to close . She moved backwardcautiously ; her hands stretched into the darkness . If she could find the wall , it would guide her to the steps  --  if she went the right way . If nothing came out of that enveloping black pit and fell upon her , slid around her neck , tightened itself .   Her fingers touched something rough and cold , it was the wall ; exactly as she touched it there was from somewhere near a sudden rasping hoarse murmur , like a beast rousing , and with a loud throb the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't . The pump settled with a regular , loud beat which filled the tiny cellar , throbbing in her ears , making the darkness vibrant . Under the cover of that sound , she slid along the wall , instinctivelytoward the right . In a moment the wall gave way behind her . She stumbled , but the sound of it was covered by the noise of the pump ; she fell upon steps , scrabbled up them , groped upward , found the door and pushed . It was n't heavy ; light came through the crack and showed a streak of white . It would reveal her clearly if she lifted it further , but she had to get out of the cellar . She pushed at the door and it fell back with a jarringthud . Moonlight poured down upon her , flooding the steps . The shrubs made black shadows . The pump was so loud behind her , waking all the black and white night to throbbing life , that she could n't tell whether or not she was being pursued . But she stumbled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something , was down on her knees again and , suddenly , tugging at Agnew 's woolly bathrobe . He was there , in a heap . He said , mumblingly , " Vicky , what did you hit me for ? " She clutched at his arms ; she dragged him to his feet . He was reluctant to move , and she had to make him come with her  --  had to make him hurry  --  had to urge him along while he stumbled and held back . They reached the gate in the yew hedge . She looked back and behind her stretched a white alley of clear moonlight , with the silver yew hedge on one side and the deep black belt of shadow made by the pine woods on the other side . She could see the clump of shrubs around the pump house . The sound of the pump filled the night with its steady throb . No one followed them  --  or at least nothing moved along the white strip . But there were deep , concealing black shadows everywhere . " My head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't make me run . " But she did , clutching his arm tightly , dragging him along through the garden , ghostly and strange at that time of night . P97They must rouse the house ; they must hurry ; they must get people to take lights and search  --  search the pump house , the grounds  --  the garden and the woods . " Oh , hurry , Agnew ! " They reached the side door on the porch and it was lighted . They had left it dark . Someone , then , must be up and about . She pulled Agnew into the house and Jody was in the hall . He heard them and came running to meet them . He had , obviously , dressed in a hurry . His collar was open and his wrinkled old face looked worried . He peered at them uncertainly . " Miss Vicky  --  was that you I heard ? " " Jody , call Mr. Hollis ! Call Mr. Bayne ! Hurry ! " " Let me go , " said Agnew . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He spoke thickly ; there was blood on his face from a cut on his forehead , and a bump swelling rapidly above his left ear . Jody cried , " Mr. Agnew  --  what happened ? You come with me ! " " I 'm murdered , " said Agnew , mumbling . " I 'm wounded ! Somebody tried to murder me ! " " You come right with me , " cried Jody tremulously , taking his arm . " You come right along with me . I fix it . . But they must search ; they must hurry ! The amount of blood , though , streaming down Agnew 's pale face was frightening . She followed Jody and Agnew to the butler 's pantry . Jody snapped on lights . Agnew put his head under the cold water . Jody got out towels and ran around him in circles , muttering and anxious . All in all , she thought later , several moments must have elapsed before Agnew announced himself as wounded but unmurdered , and Jody pulled himself and his scattered wits together . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her back , to hold the towel to his head . " I 'm bleeding to death , " he groaned . " I tell you I 'm wounded . " He broke off to hiss to Jody who was opening the pantry door , " Do n't wake Mother . " " No , no ... . " Jody , hurry  --  tell them in the pump house . . . " " Yes , Miss . " She could hear Jody 's muffled knocks , the low murmur of voices , and in a moment steps running down the stairs again . Jody went with them . After a little while , Agnew , fidgeting and murmuring , snatched the towel away , discovered his head had stopped bleeding and had only an inch-long cut in it . He went , too . She followed him as far as the porch and waited . She could hear their voices and see the glancing gleams of flashlights . But in the end they found no one . Jody was the only one of them who was sure , really sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still , moonlit night . He said it was the sound of footsteps on the gravel of the driveway that aroused him . " I was n't asleep , " he said , wrinkling up his forehead like a faithful , worried dog . " I heard somebody run  --  light and quick  --  across the drive ; I looked out the window , but could n't see nobody . So after I worried about it awhile , I thought I 'd better get up and come downstairs . Make sure nobody was breaking into the house . Soon as I got here and turned on the lights , you came . . . " He looked at Victoria . Hollis said , rumpling his blond curls , that from their accountsof the thing there 'd been plenty of time for anybody in the pump house to get away . " He was probably running for the gate by the time you reached the house , " he said . " That is , if anybody really was there . " " We might call the police , " said Michael @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tell you nobody 's there . " He looked curiously at Agnew . " What were you doing there ? Both of you , at this time of night . Looking for clues ? " He laughed shortly as Agnew blinked and nodded . They had , however , found the flashlight . Agnew pointed to it with grisly pride . It had been on the grass just outside the door of the pump house and along the edge of it , at one end , there was a perceptible , small smear of blood . " My blood , " said Agnew . " Probably there 's some hair there too . They had found his glasses too , unbroken , beside the flashlight ; but they had found nothing else . There were only two possible theories . One was that AgnewP99himself had managed to drop the door on his own head , droppingthe flashlight and his glasses , striking his head for a second time , in falling , upon the heavy flashlight and knocking himselfbriefly senseless . The corollary for this theory was that Victoria , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pump and had taken it to be footsteps . Agnew , clinging to the view that he had been the victim of a murderous attack , hotly denied this ; Victoria agreed with him . The other theory , however , was not very pleasant . It was that somebody had come up behind Agnew , knocked him senselesswith one blow of his fist , perhaps , and then given him anotherblow with the flashlight which would account for the traces of blood . And that that same person had then descended into the pump house , pulling the door down after him , Why or who ) , nobody could guess . " Certainly , " said Michael , " there 's nothing in the pump house but concrete walls . There 's no place to hide anything and , anyway , the police searched it this afternoon . " In the end , Hollis looked at the clock , said , " My God , it 's four and I 'll probably have to drill all day , " and got up . " What 's the use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't get longer leaves ? " said Agnew irritably . " If we were at war I probably could n't get here at all ! " said Hollis . " Come on , let 's go to bed . We ca n't do anything more tonight . " They trailed upstairs , turning out lights with a feeling of anti-climax . Michael went with Victoria to the door of her room . " Next time , " he said rather grimly , " call me before you start out in the night . ... " " Michael , there was somebody there . I 'm sure of it . " He said soberly , " There must have been some reason for it . We looked all over the pump house . There was absolutely nothing there and no traces of anybody 's having been there . " He looked tired ; everybody looked tired . " Well , try to forget it and sleep awhile . Tomorrow 's another day . " The sun was streaming into the room when Victoria awoke . Again someone awakened her . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Vicky  --  oh , you 're awake ! I hated to wake you , darling , but the police are here , and it 's almost noon and they want to question you and  --  oh , I 've brought your breakfast tray . " It was an unaccustomed attention on Thalia 's part . She leaned over as Victoria sat up and put the yellow wicker tray across her knees and brought her an extra pillow . Thalia looked very pretty ; as sleek and composed as a soft little bird , except she was wearing pink lawn with a very short skirt and a demurely ruffled white organdy collar . She stuffed the pillow behind Victoria 's back . She said unexpectedly and softly , " I wanted to talk to you for a minute , too , Vicky . Before you marry Michael . You see  --  Vicky , I think you ought to know that it 's only chivalry on Michael 's part . Marrying you , I mean . " The sun poured in through the windows . The French doors upon the balcony were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was going to be hot again that day . Victoria 's wedding day  --  only it was n't going to be her wedding day . She closed her eyes to keep out the glare of the sun . And Thalia said , her voice very soft , " I did n't mean to hurt you ; you 've been very good to me . But I  --  I do think you ought to know why Michael insists upon the wedding taking place today . In spite of ... " She paused and said significantly , " In spite of everything . " " Everything . . . " said Victoria , opening her eyes quickly . " Clistie 's death ? " " Yes . And . . . " Thalia 's breath stirred the ruffles of white organdy . " And the evidence against you , Vicky . Of course I know  --  we all know that you did n't murder Clistie . But still  --  well , there was your red belt , you know , " she said softly . " And you did tell Clistie something that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , Victoria , not that any of us believe it for an instant . It 's only the police . . . " She stopped , bit her lip , and said gently , " Do n't be angry , Victoria . I 'm sorry I 've spoken so frankly . It 's because it was a very difficult thing for me to say . So I  --  I blurted it out . " Thalia never blurted anything out . " Do you mean that Michael does n't love me ? " said Victoria.  | " I  --  oh , Victoria , you are so direct . You make me sound so  --  so brutal . " " You said it was chivalry on his part . " " Yes , but  --  please , Vicky , do n't be angry . " Thalia leaned forward , her lovely little face beseeching , her hand stretched out pleadingly across the silk cover . " I 'm not angry , " said Victoria slowly . " You do n't understand . " She poured a cup of coffee . Her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . The sunlight lay full and revealing upon it . It was small ; Thalia was smallbonedand beautiful . But her hands were not ; they were broad and thick , and her thumbs were curiously long with thick joints . She never wore rings and always used colorless nail polish . All at once Victoria wondered if it was because she did n't want to call attention to her hands . And then she knew that Thalia knew that Victoria was staring at her hand . With a kind of fascination Victoria watched the slight , almost stealthy motion with which those ugly thumbs moved inward , out of sight , and Thalia 's hand withdrew , so it was all at once tucked down softly into the folds of pink lawn . Thalia 's eyelids were lowered , making misty rims on her face which looked as smooth as a gardenia and had the same pale ivory loveliness . Victoria was suddenly and sharply self-reproachful . Thalia said gently , " You see , I know Michael ; better , in a way , than you do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you tell me this ? Did Michael ask you to ? " Thalia 's long eyelashes stirred but did n't quite lift . She said , " No . But I . . . " She paused for another long moment . Then she got up , gracefully . " I know Michael so well . I know how he feels about things . I really do n't think you ought to take advantage of his loyalty and  --  well , chivalry . That 's all . If you had n't met him , you know , Victoria , and  --  and taken him away from me , we would have been married . Michael and I. Michael , you know , has a future . He 'll go far and I . . . " She caught her pretty lower lip in her teeth as if she 'd said too much and stopped . She lifted her white eyelids , gave Victoria a long , full look and turned around toward the door .   " Thalia ... " said Victoria . A glass tipped as she sat upright . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Michael was in love with me , " said Thalia over her shoulder . " Oh , we were n't engaged ; it had n't come to that . But he was in love with me . Or at least , very near it . Until he came here and saw you . " Her small shoulders shrugged . She did n't turn her head . " That 's all , Victoria . Only believe me  --  I know Michael so well , you see ; and it is n't that I want to hurt you . Or stop your marriage . I only . . . " She stopped , opened the door and quietly went out of the room . The door closed gently behind her , as if she took the utmost care not to intrude upon Victoria even with the sound of a door closing hard . Victoria stared at the blank panels of the door . After awhile it occurred to her that any other woman in the world would have at least closed the door hard . Thalia 's demure , quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather startling depths . And Thalia , then , was in love with Michael . They had seen each other occasionally before Henry Frame 's death ; Victoria had known that , but she had n't thought that there was anything more than friendliness between them . But Thalia actuallyhad been in love with Michael ; and then Michael had met Victoria . And what about Michael ? Suppose Michael was , really , in love with Thalia . Suppose he had felt exactly as Victoria felt , that they had been thrown into each other 's arms by circumstances . But Michael , a man , had been loyal to Victoria ; had told her , when she would have released him , that she must take time to think , to be sure . And then Clistie was murdered . And Victoria was under suspicion . So he could n't , according to his lights , have accepted the release she offered him , even if he wanted to . There was the red belt . There were the circumstances of Clistie 's death . There was the case of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " My God , John , you suspected her yourself , " Beasley had said to John Campbell when , for an instant , he had seemed to defend her.  |p103And  so Michael had said , " We 'll be married anyway . " She looked out across the river . Through the arches of liveoaksand Spanish moss there were glittering bright patches  --  as glittering and as bright and as calm as if no one had ever died , fighting in the darkness against that deep current . As if it had never been freighted with a slim , tragic young body . Her hand jerked , turning over orange juice as Agnew opened the door unexpectedly and stuck his head in.  |p104IT  WAS a bandaged head . Agnew showed her the bandage modestlybut a little crossly , and helped her mop up orange juice . Agnew was always cross if he did n't have a full eight hours of sleep . He looked pale , his freckles standing out . He wore dirty , white duck slacks and a shrunken sweatshirt . His mother was better , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having a large breakfast . Hollis had gone back to camp early . Michael was talking to the police , Beasley and a couple of other men . " They asked me all about last night , " he said , twisting the cord of the Venetian blinds in his fingers . " I told ' em all I knew . They did n't act as if they believed me  --  I mean as if anybody really was there . They had the bandage off my head and looked at it and Beasley seemed to think it was all a put-up job . Betweenus , I mean , you and me . " His fingers stopped twisting , and he looked across the river , his eyes squinted against the glare , and said in an expressionless tone , " They said maybe we made up the whole story , just to make them think somebody was there . " " In order to divert suspicion from me ? " He nodded . " Nuts , of course . Remember the time Jody 's yellow cat caught a young rabbit and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He looked rather ashamed even now . " Neither or usp105could kill it , and we had to take it to Judson  --  who was only too glad to finish it off . You could n't kill a fly ! It 's all nuts , " he said , looking white and squinting out over the river . " Agnew , " said Victoria caught by a small and unexpected memory , " what did you mean by saying Thalia had funny thumbs ? Last night  --  no , the night before . Remember ? " " Oh , " said Agnew . " That . Criminal thumbs . " " Agnew ! " " Why , yes . Henry had them , too . I read all about it in a book . Vicky , was she here just now ? " " Yes , " said Victoria rather faintly . " I thought so ; saw her come along the hall . Looking rather pleased in a quiet , purry little way . " " Agnew , do n't ! " " Okay . Victoria , listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you think ? Do you really think it was suicide ? " " Yes ! " He turned around , peered at her , and said with unexpected gentleness , " No . You do n't really think so . If you did you would n't say it  --  that way . You 're scared , Vicky . Well , I guess we 're all scared . Beasley keeps talking about Henry . He says if Clistie knew who killed him ... Vicky , " he said abruptly , " if Henry was murdered , who do you suppose could have done it ? I mean  --  well , there 's so few of us . Yet  --  unless somebody followed him here from New York , or unless he had a secret feud with somebody living around here . Or maybe . . His face brightened a little . " Maybe some fellow at Camp Blakoe . . . " He paused , and then shook his head . " Does n't sound very likely ; I 'll ask Thalia , just the same . But unless it was something like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evidence , there 's only  --  well , us . People who knew Henry , I mean . I did n't kill him and you did n't . Mother 's capable of it , if she got upset but . . . " " Agnew ! " " But still I do n't think she did , " said Agnew reasonably . " Becauseas far as I can remember she was n't upset about anything just then . Michael is in the business ; but the accountants gave Michael 's office an absolutely clean bill of health , and he hadP106nothing to do with Henry 's office . So unless they just did n't like each other , I ca n't see that . Of course , Hollis . . . " He stopped for an instant . Victoria was sitting upright , staring at him uneasily . He went on , " Hollis is kind of a fool , someways . He 's so crazy about the Steane Mills , always has been . . . " " Hollis ! " " Why , of course . He would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much as to get through with the war and go back to the office . He would like to manage it , you know . He 's  --  well , really crazy about it . Loves every damn tree and every contract ; works like a slave and Henry would n't advance him an inch . Henry always said it would look too much like making a favorite of him  --  be bad for the morale . Henry knew how Hollis felt . And of course Hollis knew Henry was in the saddle for as long as he lived , and he was likely to live a good long while . Still , I do n't really think Hollis would murder him . Do you ? " " No ! No , I do n't think so . Hollis did n't murder him . " " Oh , " said Agnew . " Well , I do n't think so either . I  --  well , only mentioned it . Not that I like Hollis very much . And it has always seemed to me , hatred or jealousy or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's  --  fear , " said Agnew thoughtfully . " Have to cover everyone , you know . There 's "  --  he swallowed and said hurriedly  --  " there 's Clistie ; but she was murdered , too .... " His Adam 's apple went up and down . He said , " She did n't kill Henry . And there 's Thalia . " " Thalia did n't kill Henry . Her own father ! She  --  why , Agnew , that 's cruel . She loved him .. . . " Oh , " said Agnew . " Did she ? Vicky , whatever happened to Thalia 's mother ? " " Thalia 's .. . Why , I do n't know , " said Victoria , taken aback . " That is , yes , I do . She was divorced from Henry  --  oh , ages ago . Then she died . In Switzerland , I think . Why on earth ? " " I only wondered . You see , if Henry treated her very badly and Thalia wanted revenge . . . Victoria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Agnew , you must n't talk like this . Or even think  --  it 's horrible . .. .  | " So , " said Agnew unexpectedly , very white , " is murder . Clistie did n't hurt anybody . " He swung away from the window . " You 'd better go down and see the dear police , " he said becomingchildish all at once . " If they put you in jail I 'll bring you a file in a chocolate bar . A nail file ought to work . I had a look at the jail last winter and the bars looked pretty rusty . Anyway , " said Agnew with a morose scowl , " I 'll see you later , baby . " He went away , working his forehead up and down moodily , apparently to ascertain the condition of his wound . He was probably right about Hollis . She could see it now , looking back . Hollis ' insistence upon going into the Steane Mills where Henry had put him in his own office , in an unimportantposition  --  so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 'd grown up a kind of feeling that Hollis was equal only to that position and nothing better . Yet he 'd refused a job that paid better ; suddenly she remembered that . Other little instances which could be translated into a real devotion on Hollis ' part came to her mind ; he would never take an hour 's more vacation than would have been due him if he had been the merest clerk and not a member of the family and one of Victor Steane 's heirs . He had lived the year around in New York ; he had worked hard . Yet , somehow , they had thought of Hollis as a favorite son , a playboy , making a kind of half-hearted gesture toward the family business . Agnew could easily be right . When she went downstairs Michael was in the morning room , in view of the stairs , smoking and waiting , his legs thrust out , his gray slacks and white sports shirt looking very cool . He sprang up when he saw Victoria . " Hello . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're looking very pretty , " he said unexpectedly . " I was worried about you after last night . Vicky , you could n't possibly have  --  well , imagined any of that last night , could you ? I went out this morning again to look at the pump house , and it seemed to me that Agnew could have knocked the door down somehowon his own head . And if you were confused in the dark , you know , and frightened ... "  |p108She  knew that he wanted her to think that . " Somebody was there . But that is n't . . . Michael , I want to talk to you about something else . About our wedding ... " " That 's what I thought . It 's all settled . " He put his hand under her chin , tilting her face upward toward his own . He was smiling , his gray clear eyes direct and rather determined . " Michael , please listen . It 's exactly as I told you that night  --  Monday night . I was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  , " But you can now , " said Michael smiling . " All right . Let 's go out on the terrace where it 's less  --  well , public . " He linked her arm through his own , and led her through the bright dining room with the open French windows letting in the sun and the sparkle of the river . The terrace , however , was shaded by the liveoaks ; they walked along it , away from the windows . And Michael said , " This is our wedding day , Vicky . You 're not really going to  --  leave me waiting at the altar . Are you ? " He was still smiling , but his eyes were sober as he waited for her answer , leaning against the balustrade , every line of his compact figure solid and dependable . With Michael , she thought gratefully , you knew where you were . " Is it chivalry , Michael ? " she asked directly . " Chivalry ! " " I mean because I 'm  --  well , it was my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... " " No . I 'm not being chivalrous . And if it was n't for Campbell , they 'd never have dreamed of accusing you . Campbell made life hell for you after Henry 's death . It 's that that Beasley remembersnow  --  Campbell and his suspicions . Vicky , you said Monday night that it was all too unreal  --  our marriage , I mean  --  that it was the happy ending , and all that . Well , at the time you were so sure that you convinced me , too . But now I think perhaps you were wrong . Has n't it occurred to you that we are , both of us , plunged into exactly the same situation as that followingHenry 's death ? " " Yes . It makes it worse , somehow . Remembering . " She looked out at the shining , wide river with its secret currents .   " You know what 's going to happen . Reporters , I mean . Photo graphs . Questions . Suspicion . " " That 's it . Suspicion . Anxiety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murder . Yet , in spite of your convincing argument it has n't "  --  he hesitated and then said lightly , watching the river , too  --  " it has n't driven us into each other 's arm ! again . So you see you were wrong . Our love for each other was n't based on that . It was  --  and is  --  based on something real . " But Michael was wrong . She had really turned to him as she had done before , counting on his loyalty ; the difference was that this time , she knew it was n't love . She did n't know how she knew that . It was a stubborn , unwaveringcertainty in her heart . The only thing that mattered was that she knew it . And she knew too that he was lying when he said he was n't being chivalrous ; lying like a gentleman , she thought , and smiled a little wryly , and put out both her hands toward him . " I 'm so very grateful , Michael . " He caught the implication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands and brought them to his lips . " All right , " he said . " I 'm not going to try to make you marry me . Only  --  Vicky , if you need me , I 'm here . That 's all . " Footsteps on the terrace and a door closing interrupted him . It was Jody , hurrying toward them , his wrinkled black face a mask of worry . The police were asking for her , he said apologetically . Michael went into the house with her . But the State 's Attorneywould not permit him to remain while she was questioned , although it proved to be , that time , a short interview . For when she told Beasley everything there was to tell of the incident of the previous night , he made no comments . And he asked only a few questions when she told him that she believed Clistie 's room had been searched . She told him of that hesitantly , in view of the skeptical look in his face , but nevertheless she told it . " When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon . Late . Before she was found . "   " And you suggest that this mysterious intruder of last night was searching for something in her room as well as in the pump house , too ? Dear , dear . A fabled , fatal jewel , do you suppose ? Or plans for a new bombsight  --  doubtless Miss Forbes coaxed the secret from Colonel Galant . " " I told you because I thought you ought to know . If that 's all ... " " No , no , Miss Steane . That is n't all . Another moment , if you please . " His voice purred . He put his yellow hand on her wrist . He asked her to do a very curious thing and that was to take the telephone , the extension which stood on a table near him , and to ask Central for a Ponte Verde number , three , eight three O.She did so . A man 's voice at the other end said very promptly , almost as if he was waiting for it : " Ponte @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beady black eyes , said , " Ask for Miss Joan Green . " " Miss . . . " Her throat choked . Beasley snapped , " Go on . Say ' Is Miss Joan Green there ? ' " " Is Miss Joan Green there ? " said Victoria . No one spoke at the other end . Beasley said , " Repeat it . Louder . " She did so . Still no one answered , and Beasley rose and took the telephonefrom her . " That 's all now . You can go , " he said . He held the telephone , without speaking into it , waiting for her to leave the room . It was the beginning of a hot , packed day which was very different from its predecessor . The investigation , fully launched that day , was very different , too , from the investigation following Henry Frame 's death  --  although to those directly involved it had its likenesses , and they were not pleasant . It was true that the inquiry about Henry Frame 's death was automatically reopened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sheriff , the state troopers , and in the minds of newspaperp111readers , if not formally . But there was , now , no question of murder , as there had been in Henry 's death . Clistie had been murdered  --  with a belt knotted around her neck ; Joan Green had been murdered , possibly by the same weapon  --  or at least one very like it , which was not found upon her body when it was taken from the river . This time there was no need to prove , first of all , that murder existed . And if in the investigation into Henry 's death the State 's Attorney  --  then John Campbell  --  had been hampered and at last defeated by a lack of evidence , now the police were , if not defeated , at least hampered by too much evidence . Too many leads . Too many small threads to explore to the end which too often raveled off into nothing . As , for instance , Beasley 's attempt to discover who had searched Clistie 's room , and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do that day in spite of the skepticism with which he listened to Victoria 's story of it . For when he inquired of the servants , when he questioned everyone in the house , directly and indirectly , from Bessie on down to Lilibelle , the little colored chambermaid , no one knew  --  or at least admitted knowing  --  anything of it . Early in the morning they had looked quickly for the brown chiffon and lace dress ; the room they thought had been in order then , although no one remembered anything but the wardrobe . After that , however , no one had been in her room ( except Lilibelle to make the unused bed ) ; no one had seen anybody entering the room or coming from it . Except , of course , the troopers and later Victoria . No one knew of anything that Clistie had had , that anybody would want . It was a complete blank which annoyed Beasley almost as much as the blank he drew at the end of long , detailed questioningdesigned to discover who  --  if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , and why . But those were only two evidences of Beasley 's energy , patience , and minute and tireless gathering together of a mass of information , much of which was unimportant and irrelevant . It soon became evident that the case was almost entirely in his hands ; that it was by its very nature already prominent and much publicized , and that Beasley was determined , one way or another , to solve it with credit to himself . That he was also honest , and no one could doubt it for an instant , made him the more formidable . " But I rather like him , " said Michael , with a little laugh . " If only because he 's so exactly the way I want him to be , so I can hate him . He 's mean ; he 's covertly insulting when he questions you , as if he 'd already made up his mind that you were lying . He employs a brand of sarcasm that is as subtle as an axe . He 's everything that you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not very pretty , " said Bessie . Agnew said thoughtfully , " He 's nobody 's fool . " Certainly he was indefatigable , restless , full of nervous energy that sent him prowling everywhere about the place , driving at full speed to Ponte Verde , or to Camp Blakoe and back again , questioning them in abrupt , unexpected forays , lettingthem go again . He pre-empted the library , to Jody 's disapproval , but nevertheless was likely to turn up anywhere , his long , yellow face and glittering black eyes suspicious and concentrated , to question them with what seemed almost indiscriminatefavor , for he interviewed them separately , together , in groups , without apparent plan , with much repetition , with spasmodic bursts of energy and with , even then , an air of accusationbehind the simplest question . State troopers came and went at his behest , apparently ; the county sheriff occasionally ( although not that day ) formed a passive but authoritative background  --  more than a little forbidding , as if he might be called upon to make an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wore , constantly , in a heavy leather holster at his waist . They were fingerprinted that day  --  it was not a new experience ; they had been fingerprinted at John Campbell 's orders after Henry 's death . There was however no inquest . It was to come later . " When Beasley can calm down and stay in one place for an hour or so , " suggested Agnew morosely . " Well , " said Bessie , looking hag-ridden , with great brown pockets around her large dark eyes , " it 's confusing . After all  --   |p113that  girl . And Clistie . And now they say , Henry too . There 's no  --  link between them . " " Except Clistie 's dress , " said Agnew . He added with an attemptat flippancy which deceived nobody , " I do think confusinglies in the realm of understatement . " Soon , however , out of a mass of facts which might be evidence , and which might not be , which were often contradictory , unrelated ( and certainly , as Bessie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , certain odd inconsistencies came out , and certain even odder consistencies . Such as the matter of the maid . " The little maid , " said Agnew later , " who was n't there . " The maid who , as a matter of fact , did not appear to exist . And yet was seen twice . P114THAT developed late in the morning , when Beasley ( in an attempt to piece together Clistie 's actions , just before Victoria and Agnew had talked to her for the last time , there in the hall ) , pounced upon them to ask about time : exactly when and under what circumstances had each of them last seen Clistie ? They were sitting together at the time , feeling already a little battered from Beasley 's swooping onslaughts . Thalia said promptly that she and Hollis had gone to the moving pictures about nine-thirty ; had seen Clistie in the hall as they were leaving and she , at any rate , had not seen her again . Michael said he had not seen her at all , for only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about twelve or a little after . Bessie said that she had seen Clistie come downstairs , in her brown-lace dress , and go down the hall toward the kitchen about , she thought , ten-thirty ; at any rate , just before she herself had gone upstairs . Agnew agreed with this ; he had been reading when his mother went upstairs but had looked up to say good night and had seen Clistie going into the butler 's pantry . Later , while he was reading , he 'd had an impression that Clistie came back along the hall from the butler 's pantry , but he could n't be sure ; he 'd been reading , he repeated rather plaintively , and if it was Clistie , she had n't spoken to him . P115However , went on Agnew , after Victoria had gone to her room and just before Michael came in , someone had gone upstairsand it was one of the maids . " Maid ! " said Beasley , his eyes snapping . " Yes , of course , " said Agnew calmly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told you I did n't pay any attention to her . Her back was turned toward me , and anyway it was shadowy just there on the stairs . " He went on to explain : he had heard footsteps , glanced up in time to catch a shadowy glimpse of her at the turn of the stairway , had thought nothing of it and had gone back to his book . Then in a few minutes Michael had come in from the porch , had said something to him and gone through the drawing room and up the stairs and he , Agnew , had looked at his watch and decided to go to bed , too , and had turned off the light and gone . " That was just after twelve , " he said . " I did n't have my glasses on , and I 'd read till I had spots before my eyes . " Michael corroborated the time , for he had heard Agnew followhim upstairs . And Michael also corroborated the mysterious maid . He had seen her crossing the strip of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sitting on the porch , smoking  --  or rather , just at that minute I think I was strolling up and down , there on the lawn beside the porch . I just saw the girl slip from the garden hedge , cross a patch of lawn where the moonlight was fairly bright and then disappear around the corner of the house . I supposed , if I supposed anything , that she 'd been out with her boy friend and was taking the most unobtrusive way she could back into the house . Past the driveway and the front entrance , I imagine , and around to the kitchen entrance on the north end of the house . I thought nothing of it , naturally . But I did see her . " " Which maid was it ? " Michael shook his head . " I do n't know . " " She could n't have gone in the back entrance , " snapped Beasley . " I just talked to the butler and cook . They said they finished washing up about a quarter after ten , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as usual , and went to bed . They say Miss Forbes did n't come into the kitchen before they went upstairs . They sleep in the house ; this girl Lilibelle sleeps in the house . Your other maid ... " " Emma , " said Bessie . " Sleeps out . Leaves , as a rule , as soon as she can get away after dinner . " " Yes , Emma . Well , she left as usual ; the cook saw her go . Anyway , this girl Emma is as big as a house . " He turned to Agnew . " Was it Emma you saw or Lilibelle ? " " Well , " said Agnew doubtfully , " I did n't see her very clearly . I did n't have my glasses on . But I guess I thought it was Lilibelle . " Beasley batted his eyes exasperatedly . " You do n't by any chance guess you thought it was Emma ? " " Oh , no , " said Agnew definitely . And the odd part of it was that when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long calf over the other and doubling up her white apron in nervous brown fingers and threatening to giggle  --  or cry  --  at every word , she said , and stuck to it , that she had n't been out that night at all . Not even Beasley could shake her denial . And so far as anyone knew she had n't a boy friend and there was something about her frightened , incoherent denials that sounded honest . It injected anothertroublesome and perhaps important fact into the already troublesome fabric of fact and surmise that Beasley was gatheringinto his long yellow hands . For if Lilibelle was telling the truth , then who had entered the house and subsequently entirely disappeared ? For no one had seen her again . " The Yellow Peril , " said Agnew , when Beasley had darted away again , " ca n't make up his mind whether it 's an inside or an outside job . But I did see her . And I do n't think Lilibelle 's got the brains to make up a lie and stick to it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snapped Bessie . It was , however , clear enough that while Beasley doled out suspicion generously to those closest to Henry , nevertheless he did face just that problem ; was one of them responsible for Clistie 's death and Joan Green 's  --  and Henry 's  --  or was thereP117a possibility of an outsider ? An unknown ? Someone who could enter the house at will and disappear into thin air . As the mysterious maid had done . His belief was , obviously , that someone close to them had murdered Henry and Clistie ; it provided a motive for Clistie 's murder . Besides ; there was concrete evidence against Victoria . But savagely , grudgingly , yet honestly , he had to set himself to eliminate all other possibilities . For that reason , perhaps , he presently had a talk with Thalia . Had her father any enemies ? Did she know of anything in his past that would lead anyone to follow him south and murder him ? Thalia reported it briefly . " What did you say ? " said Michael curiously . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no , of course , " she replied . But obviously too , Joan Green 's death fell outside Beasley 's choice pattern of inquiry , unless he could prove that one of them had known her . John Campbell did not appear and Agnew commented on it . " Major Campbell , " he said crossly , " is conspicuous by his absence . I suppose he 's got to keep the army in step . " He brooded and said , " All I hope is Colonel Galant makes him work so hard he stays away from us . " " Well , it 's not his business anyway , " said Michael . " He 's no longer State 's Attorney . He 's in the army . Where I 'll be if we get into the war . " Thalia looked out at the shining river and said nothing . Some time after lunch , Beasley went away again , zooming off with a great clatter in a small , shabby old coupe in which he folded up his long legs like a jackknife , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troopers could do to keep up with him . Bessie sighed with relief when she heard him leave and demanded the newspaper  --  the little daily Ponte Verde paper , which had enormous black headlines . Later , there were other papers : from Pine Beach , from Atlantaand New Orleans and Jacksonville . And that day , too , i eporters , representatives of the big news agencies , began to arrive to cover the story . They came , stayed in Ponte Verde , went away , came back again , to hover , ubiquitously , near the place . The accounts of Henry 's death had been sensational enough until the verdict of coroner 's jury had stopped then as a blanket smothers a fire . Now , however , the story blazed up wildly , as if all those weeks it had smoldered . Double murder , said the columns of black print ; tragedy breaks out again in Steane mansion , on the St. Sebastian . Beautiful Steane heiress questioned . Double slaying . But just at first it was Ponte Verde 's own story , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstances of Henry 's death , a not too brief history of the Steane family and , in the little society section ( boxed in heavily , between the account of a bridge party and an invitation to all soldiers in town that night to come to the Ladies Club rooms for fruit punch and a free motion-picture show ) , a paragraph to the effect that the wedding of Victoria Steane and Michael Bayne , announced to take place that day , had been postponed . Bessie nodded approvingly when she read it . " Quite right , " she said to Victoria . " You ca n't have a wedding at a time like this . It would n't do at all . " She dropped the newspaper and stared at the river . " This reporter says outrightthat Henry must have been murdered and Clistie knew who murdered him . " " In that case , " said Michael , " what about Joan Green ? " " Yes , " said Bessie rather flatly , after a moment . " As you say , what about her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the question to repeat itself , mutely , in the hot afternoon air . Why had the girl come to the pine woods ? thought Victoria . If it was to meet someone ( and she could have come for no other reason ) , then who ? A great deal depended upon the answer to that question . For if it was to meet a stranger , someone who had no connection with them , someone concerned only with Joan Green , then suspicion of murder moved from them ; and Clistie was murdered because , perhaps , she came upon Joan Green 's murderer . But if Clistie was murdered because of Henry , then , as Michael had said , why was Joan Green murdered ? Why wasP119she in the pine woods ? Why was she wearing Clistie 's dress ? It brought her around the full circle of conjecture . Oddly enough , no one then perceived an answer that was from the beginning inherent in those questions . Bessie said , suddenly , " Beasley asked me all about Clistie . The most absurd questions , really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married and  --  oh , all sorts of nonsense . Really , " Bessie sniffed , " I think for a moment Beasley had a wild idea that this  --  girl was something to Clistie . Her longlostchild perhaps . Then he swerved to your father , my dear , and his life and times . After awhile I began to perceive he had some idea she was your unrecognized half-sister . " " Good Heavens ! " said Victoria blankly . A smile flickered over Bessie 's face . " Yes , it 's funny . If he 'd known Victor ! He was like a rock of faithfulness , and frightfullyfastidious . " The smile vanished . She looked uneasily away from Victoria and said , " Of course , what Beasley was trying to do , was to establish some connection between the  --  the dead girl and us . " " Beasley , " said Michael , stretching out his legs , lazily , " has read too many Victorian novels . But I suppose it 's routine . He questioned me , too . All alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to New York to confirm everything I told him . Apparently thinks I knew Joan Green . Well , I did n't  --  poor child . Never saw her in my life till yesterday morning . Beasley 's typical of his policeman 's job ; , he 's got all the answers . If it was n't a crime of passion it was blackmail ; he did everything he could to get me to admit having known Joan Green somewhere . The suggestion was obvious : she was blackmailing me , on the verge of my marriage to you , Vicky . Neat , " said Michael , " if not very pretty . I do n't care though so long as it  --  well , distributes suspicion . The only trouble is it should be easy to prove just who the girl knew and who she did n't know . " " Well , I certainly saw the girl exactly once , " said Thalia . " No more . I had no motive for killing her . " She shuddered a little , daintily , and added , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a suspect of me . "   There was a scarcely veiled note of mockery in her voice Michael said , " You do n't like John Campbell , do you , Thalia Never mind , he seems to be out of this . " Thalia looked at him with wide , candid eyes . " None of u &; have reason to like him , Michael . Especially Victoria . " She turned to Victoria . " You remember Joan Green , do n't you ? At the tea party . Dressed in gray . " " Yes , " said Victoria , thinking of the thin , efficient-looking girl in gray . She had stood at Bessie 's side and Bessie had given her coffee . There had been no shadow of a change in Bessie 's pleasant , polite expression ; so Bessie had not known Joan Green . " If we only knew why she came to the pine woods , " said Michael , and added thoughtfully , " And whether or not Lilibelle is lying . " Bessie shoved her untidy hair into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said , her voice suddenly uneven , " to think of somebody coming into the house . Like that . In the night . " It was not at all nice . No one spoke for a moment . Jody came to say another car with reporters had arrived . Michael went to talk to them . They were accompanied by photographers who took pictures of the pump house , the garden , the house . They did n't need to take pictures of Miss Steane or any of the family , they told Michael good-naturedly , for they already had pictures in their files . Pictures from the Frame case . They could use those . He gave them a statement , brief and non-committal , which they accepted , as non-committally but not as briefly , for they asked questions . Quick , skillful questions designed to be revealing . Bessie and Thalia and Victoria remained cautiously out of sight until they went away . It was some time after that that Colonel Galant telephoned . He talked to Victoria . " Can you come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Yes . Unless the police . . . " They wo n't stop you . Come straight to my office . It's- , about Clistie . " He hung up . Michael took her in his car and Thalia and Agnew wentP121along . Agnew went because he could never resist any excuse to get inside the gates of Camp Blakoe . He folded himself up cheerfully on the small seat behind the wide driver 's seat , where Michael sat with Victoria and Thalia . Victoria glanced at Thalia whose profile under her shady pink hat looked very gentle and calm and  --  what had Agnew said ?  --  purry . But that was wrong ; everything , it seemed to Victoria suddenly , conspired against Thalia ; there were the circumstances of her father 's death ; there was her feeling for Michael . Yet Thalia had been really a very good sport about it all . No one had guessed , not even Victoria , until that morning , that she was in love with Michael . Thalia and Michael and herself ! It was like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Michael loves Victoria  --  Victorialoves  --  well , Victoria loves nobody . And all of it belonged to another world . It had nothing to do with the grim errand that brought them , then , to Camp Blakoe . " Turn in here , Mike , " said Agnew , hunching forward . " Turn in here and tell the sentry we want to see Colonel Galant . " Agnew knew every twist and turn of the multitude of roads through the camp ; Michael turned in and stopped as the sentry came forward . He was expecting them and waved them through . A new regiment was arriving that day and a band had been sent to the gate to welcome them . They looked hot but zealous , with the sun glinting on their instruments . The leader stepped forward to ask over the sentry 's shoulder : " Seen anything of a convoy along the road , sir ? " Michael shook his head . Agnew thrust his head forward . " Maybe they came the other way , " he said helpfully . " Along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new magazines ; there 's no gate there . It 's that way . - . " He waved toward Ponte Verde . " Thanks . " The band leader grinned and wiped his face . " It 's going to be a big place when it 's finished ! We just got here ourselves . "  | " We 'll need all that unfinished space when war comes , " said Michael . " Which way do we go now , Agnew ? You seem to know the lay-out here . " " I 've watched every foot of it , " declared Agnew . " Now that they 're getting organized and the army is arriving , I suppose they 'll tighten up and not let us in without a pass . But we 're not in the war yet . Turn left . Then go right around the recreationhall . That brings you to the hospital ... . The low roofs glittered in the sun , and the blue lake glitteredtoo . It seemed a long time since the day of the Colonel 's tea party when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked . And he had warned her then , but not about Clistie . Not about a thin , tragic dead girl in Clistie 's dress . The administration building was , as the organization of the camp was being completed , a hive of industry ; cars were parked close before it ; men in uniform were everywhere ; the sound of typewriters and telephones came from the open windows . " Park in Colonel Galant 's space , " directed Agnew over Michael 's shoulder . " It 's the first one at the left of the door . " Small white boards with names in black letters on them hung from chains and designated the parking spaces : Major Huntley ; Lieut . Col. Sanders . Colonel Galant 's was the favored spot nearest the door . Agnew crawled out quickly . " If they 'll still let me , I 'll show Michael around , " he said , " while you see the Colonel . " For an instant his eyes looked sharp and hard . " Unless you 'd just as soon let me go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , wait for me . " Agnew shrugged . " Confidential , huh ? Well , that 's silly , because if it 's about Clistie , we 're all in it together . " " I do n't know what it 's about , " said Victoria . She went upthe flight of wooden steps . Michael said , " Do n't be too long . " Inside it was hot but shady . She went down the narrow , deserted corridor ; there was the smell of new wood and painteverywhere . A new girl sat at Joan Green 's desk , who glancedp123at her curiously when she gave her name and said , eyeing her , " Colonel Galant said you were to come right in . " Victoria remembered that Joan Green had been very silent and very unobtrusive ; so unobtrusive that no one really noticed her . She knocked at the door labeled Colonel Galant , and went in when he spoke . She was suddenly struck with a very odd and very unpleasantthought . For Bruce Galant turned a perfectly strange face toward her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never seen before . She thought , curiously , that murder was like that ; it revealed new faces among people one thought one knew . It was like a peephole into otherwise hidden emotions . It was like a revealing shaft of light into a dark room . Colonel Galant looked older ; his face was gray and lined ; his blue eyes were as cold as ice . He was n't just Bruce ; he was Colonel Galant . He said , " Oh , come in , Victoria . I door behind her , before he went back to his desk . " I 've got an unpleasant job ahead of me , " he said directly . " I 'll do it as quickly as I can . What do you know about Hollis and Joan Green ? " " Hollis . . . " " Yes . He knew her . " " But he did n't ! He could n't have ! He . . . " " I 'm afraid he did , Victoria . " " But  --  but none of us knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " None of you would identify her . That is , in Hollis ' case , I mean . " " Colonel Bruce . . . " " Do n't try to defend Hollis , Victoria . " He leaned back in his chair . " He knew her ; there 's no doubt of it . Beasley was just here and brought the hotel clerk . Beasley had managed to give the clerk a look at Hollis when Hollis did n't know it . He was drilling , and  --  but the point is the clerk identified him , picked him out at once . Said Hollis used to call for her and take her out . One of the girls in the office knew it too . It seems that Joan Green was a very quiet young woman ; shep121knew almost nobody ; he was the only man whom she went out with at all . " The telephone rang ; he answered it . " Send him in . And do n't put any calls through for awhile . " He replaced the receiver . Victoria said stubbornly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see her , Hollis did n't know her . He did n't even look as if . . " He shook his head . " That 's the point . Why did n't he admit it ? Openly . If Hollis had merely had a friendship for an attractive girl , why should n't he . . . ? Oh , come in . " He jerked his head toward the door as someone knocked ; Major John Campbell came into the room . " Major Campbell , " said Colonel Galant . " You know Miss Steane . Well , of course , you do . Sit down . Now then , Victoria , " he frowned at the papers on his desk . " Hollis refused to identify her ; refused to admit that he knew her at all . Well , then , why ? You see  --  well , the point is that Joan Green had ... " He bit his lip and tapped his fingers on the desk . ' She could have had a detail of military information , " he said shortly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her job to take dictation from the listening-post . Her murder might mean  --  anything . "  | " L-LISTENING-POST ? " said Victoria uncertainly , after a moment . Colonel Galant glanced at her sharply . For the first time a look of personal concern flashed across his gray , lined face . " Is it too hot in here , Victoria ? Major , will you turn on that fan , please ? " John Campbell got up and turned on an electric fan near by . Colonel Galant went on , raising his voice against the whir of the fan . " Yes . Listening-post . You see much of our business is done by long-distance telephone . It 's always important to get orders and detail exactly , consequently , whenever we talk to , say , Washington , we put a good stenographer on the listening-post , that is another telephone , and she takes a complete transcript of the whole conversation . Naturally , we pick a girl who 's quick and accurate and . . . " he hesitated and said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Major Campbell 's black head moved slightly , and the Colonel shot a quick look at him and said rather hurriedly , " That is , do n't misunderstand me . I 'm not starting a foreign agent scare here . There 's nothing here that would be worth very much to a foreign agent . Anybody who flies over the camp or visits it is welcome to take a look ; all camps are very much alike . We have no "  --  he hesitated again , frowned at the sky beyond the open window and said  --  " no secrets . "  |p126Major  Campbell looked out the window , too , and said nothing . Colonel Galant went on , after a moment , " There arc ways , of course , in which anybody could do us harm ; sabotage , I mean ; fires in the storehouses ; trouble with the water supply . Later , when we are fully organized , that will be impossible . Just now , in the confusion of building , with half the camp still open and most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have to watch out for such things . We are tightening up rules every day ; we are not yet at war , but we intend to take and enforce every precaution that we would enforce during war . Just now , during these days of organization , as I say , we want to be particularly careful . It 's a tremendousthing to organize . Now then , this girl . .. " Major Campbell said abruptly , " I 'd tell her about the .. . I 'd tell her , Colonel . " Colonel Galant gave him one glacier-blue glance . " It 's easy to see you 're not yet accustomed to the army , Major , " he said . " I 'll say what I think best to say . I called you in because of your previous rather specialized experience . " " Yes , sir , " said Major Campbell promptly . " If there is any connection between this girl 's death and Camp Blakoe 's  --  welfare , then naturally the thing must be thoroughly investigated . " " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " is a very capable fellow . " " That does n't matter ! We 've got to go into it from our point of view ! From the army 's point of view . If that girl . . . A bleak look came into his face . John Campbell said , " Did you look up the records , Colonel ? " " Yes , " he said . " Yes , John , I did . " " And she did know ? " " Yes . The records are there , " he nodded at a file in the corner . " You can look them over when you 've time . " He looked at Victoria . " What he means is that while we have no great military secrets here , we do have a "  --  he bit his lip and said reluctantly  --  " some secret radio equipment . " Major Campbell said , " It 's really secret , you know . The one thing that we  --  and any other camp that has it or anythingp127like it  --  guard with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes were intent and suddenly sober . Colonel Galant leaned forward . " You see , Victoria , this comes very close to me . In any case I would have to take steps , naturally  --  quickly . But if Hollis . . . " He glanced at John Campbell . " There 's enough there . . . " He jerked his gray head toward the filing cabinet again . " There 's enough there to be , conceivably , of interest . There are no detailed manufacturingplans , naturally , but the bare fact that it exists , that it has been sent here , that we intend to make secret trials  --  that 's enough to make us . . . " He bit his lip again . " Nervous , " finished Major Campbell , looking extremely composed , except for his intent , watchful eyes . Colonel Galant flashed him another icy blue look and said to Victoria , " Frankly , I did n't want to tell you any of this . I t was Major Campbell 's suggestion . He thought that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  something that you . . . " " The only thing I know is that Hollis would n't sell any information to anybody ! " " My dear child , " said Colonel Galant gravely , " I do n't believe you realize that ... " He stopped , drummed on the table with his fingers and gave Major Campbell a helpless look . " Colonel Galant believes , " said Major Campbell , " that if there is a link between Joan Green and Clistie , and there must be , then the chain goes on to Henry 's murder . Thus , someone close to Henry , someone in a very small circle of people , must have . . . " Must have murdered them , " cut in Colonel Galant , his face gray . " It 's not safe there for you , Vicky  --  for anybody . Yet I ca n't come and stay in the house . I . . . " He took a long breath and said curtly , " About Hollis  --  as I say , it was Major Campbell 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you question Hollis ? " said Victoria . Colonel Galant 's blue eyes flashed . " It 's not what I expected of you , Victoria  --  to take that tone , I mean . Do you realize that we may soon be at war ! People have been asked to do more for their country 's welfare than what I 'm asking you ! " Major Campbell said easily , although rather quickly , " On the information Colonel Galant now has , a point-blank denial on Hollis ' part is enough . He may admit he knew the girl , but that 's all . Honestly , I do n't think we 've got any attempted espionage to worry about , and , in any case , the only thing Joan Green knew was that we 've got some secret radio equipment . She knew nothing about it . And almost every camp  --  lots of them , anyway  --  have that . Aircraft detectors ... " " Major ! " rapped Colonel Galant . He swung around toward Colonel Galant . " Believe me , Colonel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do with espionage . " " What is the purpose then ? What 's back of it all ? If you 've got an opinion , what is it ? " demanded Colonel Galant , angrily , rapping on the table . John Campbell 's face sobered . " Well , I do n't know , " he said slowly . " But I think it 's some very deep and personal motive  --  something so strong , and something so urgent that  --  that there was no way out . " No way out  --  but murder . No one moved for a moment . Then Colonel Galant said testily , " But this girl  --  this Green girl . My God , John , I 've got to know if there 's a leak in my own office ! " " Yes , sir , " said Major Campbell a little grimly . " There 's some connection with the camp ! That girl  --  Clistie 's dress ... " " And Henry Frame ? " asked Major Campbell . " Yes . No . I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Certainly , sir , " said Major Campbell , his mouth tight . He turned to Victoria . " You see , Miss Steane , there 's no one but you in the house whom we can ask , like this , for information . Mrs. Isham ... " " Bessie would have a fit , " said the Colonel gloomily , staring at the desk . " Agnew is only a boy . Thalia Frame is  --  Henry Frame 's daughter . "  | " What information do you want ? " said Victoria stiffly . " Anything ! Everything ! " snapped the Colonel . Major Campbell said quietly , " Anything that strikes you , in view of this , as suspicious . Anything , particularly , that seems to be connected in any way with Camp Blakoe . Anythingabout Hollis , such as  --  oh , if he had more money than he ought to have had . If he 's been seeing , or writing to , or talking to anybody who might possibly be a foreign agent . " " Perhaps Joan Green was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Perhaps she gave information without intending to ; indiscreetly and against definite orders , but unintentionally . But suppose then she realized what she had done and intended to try to fix things  --  to tell me  --  to try to undo the harm she had done . And suppose Hollis was afraid she would do just that ; suppose he  --  stopped her .. " " He could n't have done that ! " No one spoke for a moment . Then Bruce Galant said heavily , " The girl was there in the pine woods . He did know her . And he did lie about it . " " But Hollis was not with Joan Green that night . 1-Ie went to the movies with Thalia . " " If the scream you heard was uttered by Joan Green , then she died after Hollis had returned , " said John Campbell . " And besides , the little moving-picture theatre was so crowded with soldiers that he and Thalia could n't get seats together . Ile sat , according to him , some rows back of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it is a fifteen or twenty minute drive from Ponte Verde to your house . They left about ninethirtyand returned about twelve-ten . But Thalia and Hollis did n't actually see each other from the time they entered the theatre until they left . And Beasley  --  the State 's Attorney , you know  --  says the exact time of Joan Green 's death is not possible to determine . But he also makes a point of the fact that you said you heard the scream after a car had driven up to the house , and you thought it was Hollis . " " How did Joan Green get there ? " said Victoria , suddenly . " Somebody must have brought her from Ponte Verde ; she could n't have walked . Somebody  --  whoever murdered her  --   |p130could  have left his car at the other end of the pine woods . There 's a road and a place where you can turn into the pine woods for a little way . He could have . . . Major Campbell was shaking his head . Colonel Galant was staring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She came by bus  --  the eleven o'clock bus from Ponte Verde to Pine Beach . At the corner below your house , she got out . The bus stops there at about eleven-twenty ; it 's about a quarterof a mile from the entrance to your place . And at about a quarter to eleven , a woman 's voice had talked to her over the telephone at the Ponte Verde Hotel , where she lived . The driver of the bus identified her . She got off the bus at that corner , and was never seen alive again . " " That 's why . . . " began Victoria , and took a long breath . The room was very hot and the fan very loud . " That 's why he made me telephone  --  to see if it was my voice the hotel clerk heard . But I did n't telephone to her . I did n't . . . " Again she stopped . Then she said : " What was she wearing when she got off the bus ? " Major Campbell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't know ; he says he did n't notice . He told Beasley that the only reason he remembered her is because she got off at such a lonely part of the road . " " But  --  then when she left the hotel ? What was she wearing then ? " " The clerk did n't see her ; no one ( except the bus driver ) has yet been found who remembers seeing her after about seven o'clock when she ate dinner in the hotel dining room ; nobody remembers exactly how she was dressed , except that there was nothing unusual about her . And they do n't change for dinner at the hotel , as a rule . Probably she was dressed in whatever she 'd been wearing during the day . The telephone call for her came at about a quarter to eleven . Clistie Forbes was wearing the brown lace and chiffon dress at about ten-thirty that night . Between ten-thirty or eleven and the next morning . . . " He stopped with a kind of shrug . Sometime between a quarter to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tragic transference had been effected . Major Campbell turned to Colonel Galant . " May I ask , Colonel , if there is anything else in the transcript which struck you as being of any possible importance ? " " No , " said the Colonel . He looked at the back of his hand and said again , his face bleak and lined and old , " No ... " Major Campbell waited . Victoria waited too . And Colonel Galant said suddenly , " That is , it ca n't mean anything . " He looked at Victoria . " Victoria , do the words , " he lifted his voice over the roar of the fan , " do the words Cara Nome ' mean anything to you ? " John Campbell 's brown face looked startled . Victoria said , " Why  --  a face powder . A song . " " That 's not what I mean , " said the Colonel . He glanced at Major Campbell . " It probably has nothing at all to do with  --  with anything , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lip , and then said shortly , " It 's only a bit of idle conversation , really . Between Bessie and Clistie . But it sticks in my mind , and I keep trying to remember . . . " " What was it ? " asked John Campbell . " Well , as I say , it probably means nothing . It was that night , you know , Monday night , after dinner . We were having coffee  --  Bessie and Clistie and I. Thalia and Hollis were at the piano ; Agnew was in a corner with his nose in a book . So none of them heard it . Anyway , Clistie  --  she was looking a little odd , you know ; thoughtful and quiet  --  at least I think so now  --  Clistie all at once asked Bessie . " He stopped as if he 'd finished . After a moment Major Campbell said , " Asked Bessie what ? " " Why , what I asked Victoria ! About the words Cara Nome . Did they mean anything to Bessie ? Bessie said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brand of cosmetics and literally the Englishmeaning , dear name , and that was all . Clistie , though , insisted a little . I thought it was a little queer ; it seemed so unimportant . Finally Bessie said it seemed to her to have some sort of special familiarity , but she had no idea what andp132was n't even sure of that , and tried to change the subject . But Clistie turned around to me and asked me if it meant anything to me . " " What did you say ? " " Good God , I said no , of course , " exploded the Colonel . Major Campbell waited again . The Colonel cast him an icy blue look , tapped his fingers on the desk and said , " And it did n't . At least  --  not then . But  --  well , it 's annoying , you know , John , but since then I  --  I keep thinking of it . As if I did - remember something , do you see ? Except I do n't . Clistie was very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , John , I think , too , that I 've seen those words , just lately , somewhere . I ca n't remember where ; at the time certainly I paid no attention to them at all . But now . . . " He whirled around impatiently so the swivel chair squeaked . " Now I keep trying to remember some special connection . . . . " He frowned at John Campbell , who said , " Connection with what , Colonel Galant ? The camp ? Clistie ? " Colonel Galant eyed him frowningly for a moment and shook his head . " Advertisement ? " suggested Major Campbell . " Concert program ? Opera ? " His voice was casual ; his hazel eyes very bright and intent . " How should I know ! " snapped Colonel Galant . He looked at his desk clock , worriedly , and added , " A tremendous volumeof detail goes across my desk . " The telephone whirred and he lifted the receiver . " Who is it ? Oh  --  oh , all right , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the telephone , he looked at Victoria . " It 's the commanding general for this areal " He glanced at the clock again , and then at the stack of papers on the desk . " Well , what about it , Victoria ? Is there anything that you know  --  anything unusual ... ? " There was nothing , of course . Nothing and no one , except  --  she leaned forward . " Someone did enter the house that night , " she said . " Agnew saw her and Michael saw her , but no one else . I do n't mean she came to see Hollis . I do n't believe Hollis could bring himself to sell any information even if he had it . But someone did enter the house and ... "  |p133But  they knew about the maid . Colonel Galant said , " Beasley told us . I think it was the colored girl  --  what 's her name  --  the upstairs maid . " Major Campbell said to Victoria , " Do you think Lilibelle was lying ? " " No . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Major Campbell , watching her , " is not a very pleasant one . That is that someone you do n't know , someone nobody knows of  --  yet knows enough of you to come and go in your house ; somebody who has nerve enough to get hold of a maid 's uniform and walk in the front door ( for the kitchen door was locked ) and up the stairway right under Agnew 's nose . Somebody who must know , even , that he 's near-sighted . " Colonel Galant spoke quickly into the telephone , " Yes , yes , put him on . . . . " He waved at Victoria . " Think it over , Victoria , " he said rapidly . " And keep quiet about this ; I do n't need to tell you that . Perhaps Major Campbell is right ; certainlythat girl did n't know much , and we can protect what she did know . If there 's any hanky-panky going on , I 'm goingto stop it . That girl , Joan Green , had , so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that was her connection with Camp Blakoe and this office . Major Campbellwill investigate . It 's entirely in his hands . Unless I have to call in the F. B. I. Beasley knows about it , of course , and will co-operate . That 's all now , my dear . Thanks . " He said abruptly into the telephone : " Yes . Oh , yes , General ... " He nodded at her as she rose . Major Campbell opened the door and walked with her through the outer office , and into the narrow , deserted little corridor . There was a smell of new wood , a water cooler against the wall at Victoria 's elbow , and the sound of steady typing somewhere near . There Major Campbell stopped and turned to face her . The night before , when Beasley had questioned her , with that little gleaming red belt upon the table like a red stain of blood , there had been something about John Campbell 's presence that was friendly . He had said only a little , there at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had merely stood for the most part , listening , smoking , immobile . Yet there had been something friendly in his very presence ; she had felt defended . She realized it now because that intangible thing seemed to have gone . He looked now as he 'd looked after Henry 's death ; remote , hard , with impersonal bright hazel eyes in a brown face and his black head a little arrogant . He said , " I really am sorry , Miss Steane . This rather puts me on the other side of the fence again , does n't it ? " He did n't sound sorry . He sounded as distant and impersonaland as hard as a Diesel engine . John Campbell , before , had said she 'd murdered Henry Frame . And now , it was her own red belt around Clistie 's neck . Material evidence . The bare walls behind him softened and blurred  --  so did his face against them ; with a clutch of inward dismay she knew there were tears in her eyes . He saw them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his arm around her shoulders . His ar.n tightened ; he bent so his face was against her own suddenly . He said again , whispering , and unevenly , " Victoria . . . " And unexpectedly , blindly , as if he did n't mean to , as if he did n't know , his mouth moved to her lips.  |p135THE  sound of typing , the bare walls went away , did n't matter ; became immeasurably distant  --  and then gradually began to come back . As suddenly as they had moved together they were apart again . John Campbell said abruptly , " I 'm always apologizing . This time  --  but I did n't mean  --  I did n't intend . . . " He stopped , looked at her , and said , " Oh , the hell . Where 's your car ? This way ? " Somebody , not Victoria , but somebody inside her body turned and walked coolly along beside him . As they reached the door , probably the same person thought suddenly : all those doors  --  how idiotic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was absurd ; it was preposterous ; she was behaving like a schoolgirl . Nevertheless , she glanced backward along the narrow , bare little passage . None of the doors was open ; well , . that was just lucky . The hot western sun blazed upon them as they went out the door and down the little flight of steps . Thalia and Michael and Agnew were sitting in the car in hot , weary silence , drinking Coca-Colas . There was a spark of laughter in Major Campbell 's eyes as . he put her into the car . But he looked , too , a little shaken .   Michael said , " Hello , Campbell . " Thalia smiled ; Agnew scowled . Then the car was moving away . John Campbell turned quickly into the administration building again . Victoria thought with dismay that she had kissed him as closely as he had kissed her . And Agnew hunched forward , to inquire why Colonel Galant had sent for her . What reason could she give ? " He wanted to know about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very busy ; he could n't come to the house . " There was a short silence . Then Agnew said , " That girl , Joan Green , worked here . I suppose they have spies on their mind and are being very hush-hush about it . " " Spies ! " said Michael . The car swerved as he glanced swiftly across Thalia , at Victoria . " Agnew , " said Victoria , " sees spies in his dreams . It 's his idea of adventure . He 's very romantic ... . " Why , Victoria Steane , " began Agnew in an indignant sputterand then , abruptly , fell silent . And Thalia murmured rather cryptically , " It takes a thief to catch a thief . Or do I mean a spy ? " " As far as I can tell from what you say , you do n't mean anything , " said Agnew , emerging momentarily and rudely from his sudden and brooding silence . Thalia , unruffled , smiled at the road ahead of them . And after that there was very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't let them look inside the new magazines that were being built . " Sentries everywhere , now , " he said . " You 'd think the war was starting tomorrow ! " Thalia said after awhile that it was very hot and she 'd seen a lot of soldiers drilling and wondered if Hollis was among them . Michael drove very fast so as to cool them , and the road , elastic and soft-looking from the heat , spun under the gray hood of the car . Once Agnew saw some cows in the road and shouted to Michael to look out ; at the corner they had to wait for anotherarriving convoy to hurry past . They arrived at the house to discover a minor commotion . There were  --  or seemed to be  --  no police around , which was , P137again , like the days following Henry 's death . Even when suspicionof murder was strongest , they had not been , really , under police guard . ( None of them could have escaped , perhaps ; and anyway , an attempt to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same time they had been actually under a certain amount of surveillance , and they were again . A motorcycle policeman was very busy with the engine of his machine when they passed the corner below the house  --  the corner where the bus had stopped on Monday night . The commotion was due to Bessie . She was sitting on the porch , in a draggled mauve tea gown , sobbing into a large green chiffon handkerchief , with Jody hovering helplessly around her with a tray on which stood a glass of brandy , and Judson , the gardener , standing in dour and disapproving silence behind her . The only word they could get out of her for some time was " ashes . " Eventually Judson , giving Bessie a scornful look , said that it was the police . State troopers ; not Beasley . They had been there and had searched the place . " The whole house , " said Bessie , becoming suddenly lucid and dabbing at her great dark eyes . " And the attics and the wardrobes and Clistie 's writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they find anything ? " " Ashes , " said Bessie sobbing wildly . Judson said , his eyes little and hard as agates , " They took ashes out of the furnace , Miss Victoria . Took them out with a shovel . I saw them . They took them away . " " Ashes , " squealed Agnew sharply . " What kind of ashes ? " Judson , who hated talking , shook his head once and said that he had to go back to the potting shed . " Can I speak to you a moment , Miss Victoria ? " he said . " Alone . " Thalia sat down and took off her hat . Agnew said thoughtfully , " But nothing was burned . Not that anybody knows of , anyway . " Michael took the glass from the tray Jody held and gave it to Bessie . Victoria followed Judson down the path . When they reached the garden , he turned to her . " I did n't want to say anything before Mrs. Isham . She 's a vurra uncontrolled woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 've never thought that Mr. Frame was the kind of man to commit suicide . " He stopped there and looked at the ground . " Judson , what are you trying to tell me ? Do you know anything about his  --  his death ? " He looked up quickly . " No , " he said directly . " If I had , I 'd have told the police . But Miss Clistie would n't have . That is , if she knew anything that involved  --  well , any of the family . " He was , of course , quite right . Clistie would have protected any of them with her life , if need be . Judson said , " It 's the spade , Miss Vicky . " " Spade ! What do you mean ? " He drew himself up ; his deep-set eyes were secretive and stubborn . " I did n't tell the police . Or the State 's Attorney when he questioned me this morning . It was none of his business . But Miss Clistie came to me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thalia had gone to Camp Blakoe that afternoon , Monday , and asked me for a spade . She did n't bring it back . It 's nowhere around . Why did she want it , Miss Vicky ? And what did she do with it ? " " But that "  --  Victoria pushed her hair back from her hot face  --  " that did n't have anything to do with the murder , Judson . " " How do ye know that , Miss Vicky ? " " Well , I  --  I do n't know , of course . Only  --  well , nothing 's been buried anywhere . " Death and burying ; the words seemed wrong and out of place in the hot , still sunshine with the bougainvillaea over the porch in full blazing glory . Wrong and rather ominous , as if their utterance invited misfortune . She said quickly , " Well , it 's nothing , Judson . Thank you though for telling me . " " Mind ye , " he said emphatically , " if I thought any of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the police . But I do not consider it so . " He looked fiercely at her , as if daring her to give him credit for either loyalty or affection , turned around and went down the path , his thick body obstinate and dogged in every move . She turned slowly back toward the house . Probably the spadep139meant nothing . It had always been Clistie 's habit to poke about the house and grounds , quietly accomplishing her own domestic ends without explanation . On the other hand , it was an odd thing to disappear , like that . What remained of the afternoon was quiet . Bessie stopped crying and ate a large slice of cake , which Jody brought her . The police did not return ; Michael fended off several telephone calls and two more reporters . Agnew sat hunched on the edge of the porch , reading a large book . Bessie , eventually , asked him what it was and he said , reading and engrossed , that it was about murder . " There 's a fine chapter on garroting , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the wicker chaise longue . " Where did you get such a book ! Give it to me at once . " " ' The next step , ' " read Agnew dreamily , " ' will be to examine the instrument of strangulation and its employment . ' " He read on further , squinted across the river , thrust out his under lip and said in a faraway voice , " Well , we all know the instrument . That was Vicky 's red belt . There was n't anything special about the way it was employed . I asked one of the police . It was just put "  --  his voice faltered a little  --  " put around her "  --  he swallowed and went on  --  " her throat and tied once and  --  and pulled . " Nobody spoke . Then Agnew went on rapidly . " There are only two possible theories about Vicky 's red belt . No , three . One : it was discovered accidentally somehow by the murderer  --  not in the house ; which would mean either that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Victoria , " I did n't lose it . " .. or that somebody else lost it . Two : Clistie herself had it . I ca n't imagine why . I asked Lilibelle when she 'd last seen the belt , but she never knows anything . The police had asked her , too ; she told me . " " What 's the third theory ? " said Michael . " Intention , of course . Somebody got into the house , and took the belt with the intention of using it exactly as it  --  as it was used . That is , " said Agnew , conquering the tendency of his voice to falter whenever he spoke of Clistie 's death , and goingp140on quickly , " That is , whoever did it intended either to involve you , Vicky , or to divert suspicion from himself , or both . Himself , " said Agnew , " or herself . For the maid I saw could have done it . So that theory has something to back it up . Victoria went to her room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was on the balcony . The maid  --  or whoever it was  --  could have gone into Vicky 's room , got hold of the belt and then . . . " Then disappeared into thin air , " said Bessie irritably . " I wish you 'd stop talking about that . It was either Lilibelle or nobody . " Her voice was defiant . Her eyes , roving the shrubs and hedges of the garden , were uneasy . Agnew went on . " Then , of course , the maid  --  excuse me , Mother  --  the unknown quantity , could have waited in Victoria'sroom until Michael and I came upstairs , and the coast was clear . And then she came down again . Yes , that could have happened . " " I think it was Lilibelle you saw on the stairway , " said Bessie stubbornly . " If it 's an opportunity for some  --  some tramp to get into the house unobserved and take Vicky 's red belt that you 're thinking of , I should say a whole regiment of tramps could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " A tramp , " said Agnew somberly , " would n't have murdered Henry . And then come back to murder Clistie and Joan Green . A tramp would n't have remembered that Victoria was the choice suspect of the police when Henry was killed ; that must be , you know , the reason for the red belt . To make Victoria the suspect again . Vicky , who hates you like that ? Enough to see you charged with murder . You have n't done anything to anybody , have you ? " There was a rather stunned silence . Then Michael got up , walked across and put his hand on Agnew 's shoulder . " You 're worrying Vicky , Agnew , " he said rather gently , as the boy looked up . Agnew gave him and then Victoria a startled look . " Oh , I say ... I did n't mean  --  aw , now , Mike , Vicky 's all right . She 's got guts . " " Agnew ! " said Bessie . " Put that book away and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Agnew sulkily . " If you do n't want to know who murdered her . . . " He complied in outraged dignity , and returned to sit with a wounded and brooding air on the edge of the low porch . " Dreadful boy , " murmured Bessie . But she eyed him uneasily , as she lay back in the great wicker chaise longue . The sun had gone down by that time and soft gray clouds covered the sky like a blanket ; a mist crept up slowly from the river , clothing it in distance and mystery . After dinner , with the river misty and the moon that night half-hidden by clouds , so the whole night , the sky and river and mist were pearly and luminous , Michael and Victoria walked in the garden again to the point above the river where there were chairs and a sundial . It seemed a long time since they had stood there together in the moonlight ; a long time since the Colonel 's tea party  --  where John Campbell had talked to her of murder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did so then , looking out across the river through wraiths of Spanish moss and mist which , in the diffused pearly light , were strangely beautiful and a little ominous . Michael was angry and astonished . " But good God , Vicky , " he cried , " why did n't you tell me ! The man was warning you of danger . " " I did n't believe him . " " Look here , " said Michael suddenly . " Do you know much of Campbell ? I mean beyond the obvious facts . " Victoria thought back . He lived in Ponte Verde ; he had been State 's Attorney , therefore he must be a lawyer . He was in his thirties , probably . He liked dogs and horses and did n't like murder and that was all she knew . All , that is , except that she knew so many other things  --  odd things , like the way he walked , and the way his eyes laughed , and the way he said Victoria . The way he held a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly . " What is the matter , Victoria ? " said Michael . He could n't see her face clearly in that pale and shifting light ; nevertheless , she said hurriedly , confused , " Nothing . That is , I do n't know anything at all about him . Why ? "   " It struck me that it was queer the way he let the thing drop . If he still believed Henry was murdered , why did n't he do something about it ? " " He said he had to abide by the decision of the coroner 's jury . " Michael uttered an impatient exclamation . " If it was n't for him and the unwarranted stand he took against you , Vicky , you would n't be on the  --  on the spot you 're on right now . " Clouds shifted so that gradually the light was less and the shadows came nearer ; the pine woods and the river took on a quality of sentience , of awareness , of threat . She moved uneasily . " Let 's go back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They strolled back toward the house . But Michael was deep in thought and , as they reached the lighted house , said , " He dropped the case when he still believed it was murder . And then took the trouble to warn you just exactly then . The night before Clistie  --  and that girl were killed . Why ? " " But he could n't have had anything to do with it . He did n't know any of us ; there would have been no motive . " Michael said slowly , " Last winter , I mean after Henry 's death , I thought Campbell was  --  well , a decent sort . Mistaken , but doing what he thought was right . Now , I 'm not so sure that he 's entirely disinterested , and I think it 's time to . . . She interrupted him . " But he did n't know Henry ! Someone would have known of it ! He would have said so ! " " Would he ? " said Michael after a moment . And a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 'd said , suddenly harsh , " You 've forgotten one thing . The fact that he was the kind of man somebody might want to murder . " He 'd meant Henry Frame . As if he knew . P143THE night was quiet and , for that matter , parts of the next day . Or comparatively quiet . Beasley darted into the drive a time or two at top speed in his chugging little car , and shortly went away again without , so far as any of them knew , accomplishing much . He talked to Lilibelle again , reducing her to tears but not to confession . He talked to Ernestine and Jody about the time when they 'd bolted the kitchen door . He prowled the house on one occasion , spending some time in Clistie 's bedroom . He visited the other bedrooms , too ( according to Agnew ) , and went away with something wrapped in newspaper , under his arm , which was , as Bessie said later , a little unnerving , particularlyas no one knew what it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who asked him , that the ashes from the furnace had yielded nothing of interest . He did not say what he had expected them to yield . State troopers came , too , and took more fingerprints from the pump house . They were there for a long time . Agnew , hovering on the outskirts and watching them from the yew hedge , reported that they went away disconsolately . Certainly the bare , cemented , little pump house was not a fertile field for clues . Again they saw nothing of Major Campbell . If , however , it P144was his job to read through the entire bulk of every telephone conversation Joan Green had taken in shorthand and then typed , during the months of her employment at Camp Blakoe , it explained his absence . Or so thought Victoria ; she could not , of course , say anything of it to the others . " I do n't like this Eliot Beasley , " Bessie said once . " But anybody is better than Campbell . Thank Heaven he 's in the army now and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , " She fanned herself with a long , chiffon handkerchief . Victoria could not tell her she was wrong . The day was hot again , cloudy and very sultry . However , there was not a drop of rain anywhere in the vicinity  --  which later had its own small significance . It seemed long because there was too much time to think . Yet in another way it passed very quickly . Certainly that day , plans were made and last desperate contingencies considered . But in view of the previous days it was quiet  --  at least to the outward eye . There was , of course , newspapers in full cry now , and reporters . There were telegrams and a few rather cautious telephone calls from friends in the neighborhood . After one such telephone call Bessie came back to the porch fanning herself with long sweeps of her handkerchief , like an actress stealing a scene , and looking rather grimly amused . " That , " she said , " was Eleanor Updike . She thinks a spy did it , and wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I 'd have a Nazi even if we are not at war  --  yet . " Bessie snorted . " She did n't seem to want to talk for very long . She acted as if I was Mata Hari in disguise . " " You 'd have to be her ghost then , " said Agnew grumpily . " She 's been dead for years . Vicky , you 're looking kind of peaked  --  come on and play some tennis with me . It 'll do you good . " He made her go while Thalia murmured that nobody could possibly play tennis on a day like that , and Michael showed another photographer and two reporters the pump house and the pine woods . But the game of tennis was not a success . Agnew , a remarkably good player with or without his specta/Iles , was that day erratic and absent-minded , and before they finished the first set , Victoria missed a serve , slipped , skinned her knee and , sitting unexpectedly in the middle of the hot tennis court , burst into more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ net and ran to look at her knee . " But my gosh , Vicky , it 's hardly scratched ! My gosh , what are you crying for ! My gosh , " said Agnew sitting beside her and eyeingher with horror . " Does it hurt like that ? " " N-no .. . " Then what 's the matter ? " " Give me your handkerchief . " " Here .... " He watched her anxiously . " Sorry , " she said . " Thanks . " " Vicky , what 's gone wrong between you and Mike ? " " Me and . . . " She stared at him . " How did you know ? " " Guessed . " " How ? " " I du n no . " He shrugged . " No love light in your eyes , I guess . Besides you 're so darned quiet . Too quiet  --  as if you 're afraid to let down . Of course , none of us feels exactly jolly . And I know you feel like hell about  --  about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , with the wedding postponed and all . But still ... " " I do n't think there 's going to be a wedding , " she said . He got up briskly and gave her a hand . " Come on over to the bench , " he said practically , " and tell me all . When did you decide you were n't in love with Mike and why ? " There was n't really much to tell . Agnew , however , understood what there was . " Of course , I see , " he said , balancing his tennis racket on his knees . " I thought at the time that it was all too , too romantic . Whirlwind courtship , love at first sight  --  well , second , anyway  --  then the big rescue and wedding bells . But do n't go too far the other way , Vick . Mike 's pretty regular , you know . " The tennis racket fell over . He bent to pick it up and said , not looking at her , " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got your mind on , I mean . " " No ! " There was a long pause . Agnew put down his racket and gotP146a tennis ball out of his pocket , bouncing it thoughtfully in soft little thuds against the turf . The air was very still ; not a leaf in all the green around them seemed to move . She said , presently , " Agnew , who could have killed her ? " He did n't reply for a moment . Then he said abruptly , " Whoeverkilled Henry , I think . But I do n't know who or why . " " I do n't suppose that there 's any doubt now that Henry was murdered . " He shrugged . " I always rather thought it was murder . But only because he was the kind of man somebody might want to murder . There was n't any real proof . And there is n't now , and I imagine there never will be . His murder is important only because it happened . I mean , it seems to have launched  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too ; but Agnew knew Henry . " Agnew , " she said impulsively , " do the words Cara Nome mean anything to you ? " " Cara Nome ! " He turned his freckled face with a jerk to peer closely at her . " Why ? " " Because "  --  she could tell that much , she decided , without betraying Colonel Galant 's confidence  --  " because Clistie asked ! Bessie that , the night she was murdered . Just that  --  she did n't explain . Do you know anything about it ? " He considered it slowly . " Outside of Rigoletto , no , " he said finally , his face screwed up with concentration . Presently they strolled back to the house . When they came to the driveway Victoria stopped and put her hand on Agnew 's thin wrist . " Thanks , " she said . To her astonishment , Agnew patted her shoulder almost tenderly . " You 're a nice girl , Vicky , " he said . He added quickly , alarmed , " But do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crying . I 'm only .. . " Scared , " he finished . " I know . So am I. By the way , I do n't suppose you want to tell me why Colonel Galant sent for you in such a hurry yesterday ? " " No , I  --  ca n't . " " Oh , " said Agnew . " I did n't think so . Well , Vicky , whetherP147you 're going to marry Mike or not , ask him about a lawyer . Get one down from New York . I  --  I do n't like that red belt . And the way Beasley acts , " said Agnew avoiding her eyes . " Not , " he added somberly , " that a lawyer can change any facts . " They went back to the house . Michael had already sent for a lawyer . " I talked to him over the telephone , " he said . " I hope it 's all right , Vicky dear . I did n't want to  --  to bother you , so I just went ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's one of the best . He 'll fly down from New York if you  --  if we , " he amended it hastily , " need him . Right away . But if nothing breaks for awhile , he wants to finish a case he 's on now . He 'd read the newspapers . He said to tell you  --  that is , for all of us , to sit tight . " " Gleason , " said Bessie thoughtfully . " That 's the criminal lawyer . " And added , thoughtfully too , " I wish Hollis would telephone . " Hollis , however , did not telephone ; he arrived just before dinner . It was , all in all , a quiet day . Yet , as evening came on , the sense of waiting waiting for something that must happen , waiting for Beasley to sift and assort the evidence he had gathered so strenuously the previous day , grew almost unbearablytense . They were all uneasy and , as Agnew said , too quiet . Yet there was not much they could say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every theory had been uttered too often ; every thought had followed the same well-worn circle  --  and eventually met the same baffling wall past which it could not go . But so far as evidence went , or material clues , there was nothing that day that was new to Victoria ; nothing she saw or heard or remembered that made the smallest chink in that wall . Certainly there was nothing to suggest Hollis ' implication in a plot to sell information to a foreign agent . Except , of course , the maid who walked upstairs and disappeared , but that could mean anything . And nothing .   And Hollis , himself , looking very tired , with fine lines showingaround his hard , light-blue eyes came in time for dinner . Colonel Galant had arranged a leave , he told Bessie shortly . Victoria could not tell from his bearing whether or not Colonel Galant had yet questioned him about Joan Green . Almost immediately after dinner Beasley arrived too  --  with a large manila envelope , Major Campbell , two state policemen in uniform and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a detailed account of Henry Frame 's death , the circumstances surrounding it , and the course of the investigation . One of the policemen was a stenographer and whipped out a tablet and a supply of pencils . Major Campbell , his brown face guarded , sat in one of the red leather armchairs drawn up to the library table . Victoria was sent for , and Hollis , and Michael . And the middle-aged woman in black looked at Victoria and at Michael and shook her head , and then at Hollis and nodded . " That 's the man , " she said in a weary voice . " I 'd know him anywhere . But I never saw the girl  --  Miss Steane  --  before , except , of course , her pictures in the papers a few weeks ago . If Joan knew her she never told me . And I never saw the other man .... " She looked at Michael . She was Joan Green 's aunt . Hollis flushed a bright pink . Beasley said , leaning foward into the light so his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes gleamed , " Where did you see Hollis Isham ? " The woman had a plain , rather nice face , and an air of honesty . " In Ponte Verde , " she said . " I had come to do a little shopping and to see Joan . It was the first time she 'd been away from home , you know . She was "  --  her voice wavered a little  --  - " she was a very quiet girl . She did n't make many friends and she was very keen about her job . Well , he was at the tobacco counter in the hotel . He did n't see us , but Joan pointed him out to me and then later told me he had taken her out a few times , to the movies and driving and to dinner . He 'd got acquainted with her at camp , at one of the dances there . She said he was rich , but that did n't make any difference to Joan , " she said sturdily . " Except that  --  well , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him more than he liked her . Joan was  --  very quiet , " she said again . " She did n't say much ; that was all , really . But I remember telling her that there were lots of nice young men in the world and that she was very young . " Hollis put up his fair head . He said , " Mrs. Green , I ca n't tell you how sorry I am about  --  about everything . " He turned to Beasley . " All right , " he said , " I knew her . She was a nice girl . I liked her and I went out with her a few times . Now what are you going to make of it ? " Beasley said to Joan Green 's aunt , " So you were worried . You thought there was something not quite . . . " Not at all , " said Mrs. Green . " Joan was a nice girl . It 's exactly as I told you ... : " Hollis interrupted angrily , " I 'll tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't kill Joan . " " Why did n't you identify her ? Why did you pretend you did n't know her ? " " Because . . . " Hollis began angrily and then stopped short , scarlet , angry  --  and afraid . Victoria saw that . And Beasley turned to Mrs. Green . " Think , now . " he said . " Surely Joan talked to you about the Frame murder . Everybody was talking of it . What did she say ? " Mrs. Green drew herself up . " You 've asked me that many times . My niece , " she said with quiet dignity , " never mentioned the murder of Henry Frame . If she read the newspaper stories about it , she never spoke of it to me . I 'm absolutely sure that with the exception of Mr. Isham , she knew none of the people concerned with it . And it 's my opinion that she did n't know him until after the Frame murder . " " But you knew Isham 's name , " persisted Beasley . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You admit you read all about it . " " So did everyone else in the county , I imagine , " said Mrs. Green heavily . " Yes , I knew Hollis Isham 's name ; at least his last name ; Joan said it was Isham ; and I 've identified him . But I "  --  she looked at Hollis and said firmly  --  " I do not believe that this boy killed her . I am going now , if you please . It is a long drive home .... " P150John Campbell said quickly , " We 'll send you in a car . . . " He went to the door with her . At the door they met Bessie . She stared but drew back and let them pass and then , beads swinging and bracelets jangling , swept up to Hollis . " Hollis , my dear , I heard . I was listening , " she said , and turned to Beasley . " I 'll tell you all about it , " she said , twisting her big , swarthy hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't kill her , but he did n't tell who she was either because I . . . " Take this , " snapped Beasley at the policeman with the tablet . Hollis interrupted , " I 'll tell it , Beasley . I met Joan at one of the dances . I 'd seen her in Colonel Galant 's office . She was a  --  a nice kid . I liked her . But my mother . . . " " I did n't approve of it , " said Bessie . " I told Hollis to stop going about with her . I told him I  --  I would n't have it . And he stopped . When I found it was  --  was Joan Green who was murdered , naturally , I would n't let him tell anyone he knew her . It was absurd , to drag him into suspicion like that ! " Major Campbell returned and quietly closed the door . His eyes met Victoria 's as he did so , briefly and without , apparently , any remembrance of the last time they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of typing in the distance . Hollis said : " I did n't kill her . " " But you failed to identify her the morning she was found , " said Beasley . " You refused to admit that you knew her . That was before your mother knew her name ; before she advised you to keep quiet . "   " Yes , " said Hollis . " It was crazy . Not to admit it , I mean . But I  --  I knew what they 'd say . That she was murdered here . On the place . Thrown into the river . If I 'd told the truth , then you 'd have said  --  just what you 're saying now . And she ... " Hollis was quite white ; his long obstinate upper lip set itself ; his blue Steane eyes were very light and cold . He said , " It 's as her aunt said . She was a nice kid . And I  --  liked her . It was a shock . . . " He stopped abruptly . Bessie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " But you must have known we 'd discover it sooner or later . " Bessie said , " You must try to understand . He ... " " Mother . . . " Please let me talk , Hollis . " She spread her jeweled hands out on the table and leaned forward fixing her large , dark eyes upon Beasley . " He guessed who it was when they described her over the telephone ; that is , he did n't guess , but it  --  it sounded like her . He told me that later . And he was horrified and shocked . We all saw that at the time . " Her eyes flashed around and she caught Victoria 's eyes and Michael 's and said demandingly , " Did n't we , Victoria ? Did n't we , Michael ? " " Yes , " said Michael . " He was shocked , and surprised . " Victoria remembered Hollis at the telephone . The way he   sagged against the wall when the police described the woman they had found in the river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Yes , " said Bessie . " But he did n't tell me . He did n't want to alarm me , and we  --  we 'd had words about the girl , you see . He did n't . . . " She swallowed convulsively , " he did n't want to give her up . Yet he was n't really in love with her , you see . " " Oh , Mother , do n't , " said Hollis . He turned brusquely away , walked over to the window and said over his shoulder . " Tell the truth . It was murder and I  --  I did n't want to be mixed up in it . I  --  it was an impulse . And I looked at Joan , there in that beastly little room and I  --  I could n't say , yes , I knew her . I did n't even tell Mother until after Joan was  --  was identified . I could n't . . . " He stopped . The room was very still for a moment . Then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know it . Anda coward . All right . But I did n't kill her . " tBessie did n't move ; only her great ringed eyes followed Hollis and her hands twisted . Victoria started toward Hollis , realized that sympathy would be another drop of humiliation , and stopped . Major Campbell said to Bessie , " Did you recognize the girl ? " Her great eyes flashed . " No ; certainly not . " " Did you ever talk to her ? Over the telephone , I mean . " " No , " she said violently . " A woman did telephone to her , " said Beasley . " Mrs. Isham , why did you want your son to stop seeing her ? " " Because , she  --  because I did . " " There must have been some important reason . Did she know anything about Henry Frame 's murder ? " Hollis turned around . " Of course not . She knew nothing of it . How could she ? " Bessie said heavily , " I did n't want Hollis to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to marry Victoria . There 's the busi. ness , you see . Hollis could manage it . " She glanced at Victoria . " You must have known that , my dear , " she said breezily. " 1 never really wanted you to marry Michael . " She glanced at Michael , too , gave him a queerly polite and **25;8809;TOOLONG , and added , " Not that I object to you , Michael . I just did n't want her to marry anyone but Hollis . " Michael , looking a little amused , said as politely as Bessie , " I quite understand . " " But Aunt Bessie . . . " began Victoria and stopped , with a feeling of helplessness . Hollis said over his shoulder , " Victoria does n't care a hang for me , Mike . There never was anything between us . It 's just an idea of Mother 's . " Beasley said , his voice still purring , " But Mrs. Isham , Miss Steane is to marry Bayne . She would have been married to him now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality of softness  --  " except for the fact that Joan Green and Miss Forbes were murdered . " Bessie blinked and said violently , " I did n't kill either of them to stop Victoria 's marriage . If that 's what you mean ! " Major Campbell came forward . " Mrs. Isham , had Joan Green ever come to the house before ? " he asked . Hollis replied , " No . Never . " " Yet she did manage to find her way from the corner where she got off the bus , through the grounds , to the pine woods . " Hollis shrugged . " How did she get there , do you think ? " " How should I know ? I did n't meet her . " " But she must have met someone . Do you know who ?  --  ' " Certainly not , " said Hollis . " Unless . . . " " Unless what ? " " Well , " said Hollis , " there 's this maid that was wandering around . " " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You 're goingto make the most of her , are n't you ? " " It could have been a man , " said Hollis . " That 's all ... . " I 'm told , " said John Campbell , " that Miss Green was very good at her job . Did you think so , Isham ? " Hollis looked at him suspiciously . " Why , I do n't know . How should I know ? Ask the officers she worked for . " " She did have a very retentive memory , had n't she ? " " I do n't know , " said Hollis sulkily .   " Did she ever talk of Colonel Galant ? Or  --  or anything at all to do with affairs in the office ? " Hollis whirled around . His face was red again and his light eyes were snapping . " Listen , " he said . " Colonel Galant called me into his office late this afternoon . We 've had all this out . Did n't he tell you ? Or ... I see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question me , too . Well , listen  --  I did n't sell any militaryinformation . " " Hollis , " cried his mother . " You ! " " Oh , be still , Mother . I did n't sell any information . I did n't know anything to sell , and I would n't have known where to sell it if I had known anything . And I would n't have done it , anyway . So that 's that . " There was a long silence . Then Beasley said softly , " Well , let 's just go over all this again . " An hour later he let them go . Without , so far as Victoria could see , adding a scrap to his stock of information , except the fact that Bessie had told Clistie about Joan Green . " So Clistie Forbes knew the girl ! " he cried in triumph . " Certainly not , " said Bessie . " She 'd never seen her . She only knew of her  --  her name and where she worked and how Hollis had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to telephone to the girl . You told her to get the girl here . Then you got rid of both of them . " Beasley 's method of questioning was almost entirely accusation . Bessie turned purple . " I did not ! " she shouted . In the end , both Hollis and Bessie stuck to the explanation they had given him . And when they 'd gone he turned all his guns upon Victoria . Michael would have stayed , but Beasley made him leave . " We 'll come to you again , later , " he said with a little smile on his wide , purplish lips . " Just now I want to talk to Miss Steane . " So Michael had to go . And then , with the heavy oak door closed , the light from above pouring down , the thick notes about Henry Frame 's death and its subsequent investigation before him , Beasley began . P155Her thin scarlet belt around Clistie 's neck . Her story that had sent Clistie out into the dark , mysterious night . Her quarrel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frame was murdered . Everybody now called it murder . Obviously , Beasley 's inquiry about Hollis and Joan Green , his accusations that Hollis had murdered the girl , that Bessie had murdered her and Clistie , constituted only his own manner of inquiry . Victoria herself was still his principal suspect ; he made it abundantly clear . Major Campbell listened  --  tracing figures on the table with his fingers , his face inscrutable . Once he got up and went to the door and had Jody bring some ice water and poured a glass of it for Victoria . Once he got out cigarettes , gave her one and lighted it and put the package near her . Beasley went on . He referred to the notes of the investigation following Henry Frame 's death . John Campbell 's notes , on file in the office that now was Beasley 's ; notes that with every word emphasized the case John Campbell had built up against her . He read aloud in a rasping , inexorable voice her own admissions , her quarrel with Henry , what she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . She had told Henry she was determined to investigate the business ; had n't she ? It was all down in black and white before him ; questions John Campbell had asked , questions she had answered . " Yes , " said Victoria . " You told him you were determined to be given control of your money , did n't you ? And when he told you that you could do nothing so long as he lived , you said you realized it . " He looked at the notes before him and quoted . " Answer : ' I said , Yes , I realized that . But there must be some way to get rid of him . ' Question : ' What did he say ? ' Answer : ' He said  --  I think he said , " There is n't any way , I tell you . As long as I live . " ' Do you remember , Miss Steane ? " John Campbell , his face hard and set , lighted a cigarette . Victoria said in a low voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lilibelle heard it as she was going through the hall . Mr. Campbell inducedher to tell it . "   " Why did n't you fire her ? Certainly her story did n't improve your situation . " " I did n't kill Henry . She only told what she heard . She was  --  made to tell it , " Victoria said wearily . " She did n't mean to make things worse for me . " John Campbell said suddenly , " There 's not much use in going back over that evidence , Beasley . We got everything we could get at the time . I do n't think , honestly , at this date , you 're likely to get anything further . " " Oh , do n't you , , John , " said Beasley . " That remains to be seen . If Clistie Forbes was murdered because she knew something about Frame 's murder , there are motives in plenty . Or rather suspects in plenty , all with the same motive . Frame kept Miss Steane  --  and Hollis Isham , and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  from using money that belonged properly to them . Not only that , but there was nothing they could do about it as long as he lived and , since he was embezzling every cent he could , there was a sound reason for him to refuse , utterly , to permit any kind of meddling on their part in the business . He let Hollis work in the office , but it was an unimportantclerk 's job ; nothing that gave Hollis any insight into the way the business was run . Oh , there was motive for murder , there ! Even Michael Bayne shared that motive ; he wanted to marry Miss Steane and  --  supposing for the sake of argument that it was her money he was interested in and not Miss Steane  --  he could n't get hold of that money until Frame was dead . So he had a good motive too . " John Campbell 's lips tightened . " Not at that time , I believe , " he said . Victoria said , " Michael scarcely knew me , then ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beasley , wagging his black head . " But everybody had a motive just the same . Bayne profited by Frame 's death  --  or will profit as soon as you are married to him , Miss Steane . Unless , " he grinned wolfishly , " you have a prior engagement . " John Campbell got up suddenly , shoving his chair violently behind him . " You 've questioned her long enough , Beasley . It 's late .... " Beasley smiled . " That 's funny coming from you . " HeP157glanced at the thick sheaf of notes and thumped them with his yellow clawlike fingers . " She was your suspect , you know , John . " He whirled around to Victoria again . " You telephoned to that girl and told her to come here . Why ? " John Campbell interrupted again ; still standing , his hands tight and hard around the back of the chair before him , his black head high . " The hotel clerk was n't sure it was Miss Steane 's voice , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll thank you to remember that , John . And I was under the impression that you were under orders from Colonel Galant to investigate the case from the Joan Green angle . Not to undertake to defend Miss Steane . " John Campbell did n't look at Victoria . " I 'm not defending anybody . I only say that Joan Green 's murder gives the whole thing a new slant . " " Well , then , " said Beasley , " find out who murdered Joan Green . And why . " He glared at John Campbell and turned to Victoria . " Miss Steane , I want to ask you a question pointblank , and I want you to answer yes or no . Did you , on Monday night , enter the pine woods ? " Something a little perplexed came into John Campbell 's face . " No , " said Victoria . " You 're sure of that ? " " I am sure . " " You would swear to it . ... " " What are you getting at , Eliot ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothing ; nothing . Merely astatement . " Michael knocked on the door and came in ; helooked white and angry . " Have n't you done enough for tonight ? " he demanded . " You 've questioned her for hours . Come with me , Vicky , " he said , and led her toward the door . Beasley made a motion to stop them . John Campbell , his face rather pale , too , under its tan , said quickly , " Oh , let her go , Beasley . You ca n't do any more tonight . " At the door Victoria glanced back . John Campbell was put- ting together the notes of the investigation into Henry 's death . Beasley was still sprawled in the chair , staring into space with narrow , shiny black eyes . They went away soon after . Victoria , in her room with the doors open upon the balcony , heard the cars leave . The night was hot and dark ; there were clouds , so only occasional moonlightfiltered through the clouds , and gave a ghostly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the river . " Well , at any rate , " Michael had said with comforting calm , when she told him of the interview , " they 've got nothing new . " Except , of course , Hollis . But they had n't arrested him and John Campbell 's questions sounded as if they had little if any real evidence against him . Yet it seemed to her then that there had been something evasive in Hollis ' eyes , something guarded  --  something not told . It was then just after eleven  --  not as late as it had seemed . And it was shortly after that that she made a singularly unpleasentdiscovery . For she took down the shrouded wedding dress , still hanging beside the window , intending to fold it away in a drawer . Thinking of Clistie 's little hands adding the last stitches to the dress , she took off the cover . And the white satin was hacked and slashed and shredded  --  almost as if it had been a live thing , stabbed to death . It was , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though , that that very fact gave the thing a peculiarly wanton and brutal quality . She wrapped it up again , and put it away . The little gold dock pointed at twelve when she put out the light . She decided finally to tell Beasley or John Campbell , although she could not see any possible connection between that and Clistie 's murder . It was still cloudy and still hot . She pinned her thoughts to something safe , something everyday and reassuringly commonplace . And rather oddly she was thinking of the fan in Colonel Galant 's office , the steady buzz and whir of it , when she finally went to sleep . It was odd because at that very moment the fan was still go/ing and the windows were still up with insects whirring against the screen and vying energetically with the whir of the fan . Colonel Bruce Galant was at his desk . His coat was off , hanging over a chair , his collar opened , papers stacked on his desk and cigarette ends overflowing the ashtrays . That was at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him . The clouds were heavier by that time and the moon hidden . The lighted window made a bright square . Colonel Galant 's khaki-colored shirt was a perfect target . Victoria , naturally , neither knew nor dreamed of that . She was asleep and did not awaken until some time later . When she did awaken it was because she was dreaming of the night Joan Green was murdered and the scream she had heard . And the splash  --  very clear and distinct ; so clear , indeed , that she sat up abruptly , awake and listening . It was very dark and very still . So she heard someone running heavily along the grassy slope below the balcony from the river , she thought . She got up , sharply awake , and went quietly out onto the balcony . It was dark , yet the clouds were moving over the moon and a faint luminous light was beginning to break through them . The sound of running footsteps had stopped . Vines brushed her shoulder . The faint luminousness over lawns and river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand out against it . And all at once someone was walking along the terrace  --  lightly , like the soft steady patter of rain upon the stones . She leaned over the balcony railing ; in the daytime the open terrace , east of the house and adjoining the porch at the south , was visible from her balcony . Now it was only a faintly lighter strip in surrounding darkness . But the light was increasing , and she thought now that she could see a moving figure , close to the house wall . She could hear the footsteps distinctly in that stillness  --  light , soft , quick . If only the moon would come out . . . . A clear patch of moonlight lay suddenly and whitely on the lawn , and the figure on the terrace was almost out of earshotP160now and , by contrast , less clear . In another second or two it would reach the corner of the house . It did . And just at that instant the broadening patch of moonlight reached it . A woman in a maid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was gone . The soft patter of footsteps stopped . The moonlight lay white and clear upon an empty terrace . P161IT WAS N'T Ernestine . If it was Lilibelle , the uniform was different , somehow , than she customarily wore  --  longer , and bulkier . Whatever , whoever it was , she must alarm the house , wake everybody  --  set them to searching . Agnew had seen the mysteriousmaid and Michael , and now she had seen her , too . It was important ; it was the outsider . The unknown . It proved her existence . Yet the night was so quiet and still that she thought suddenly , have I been dreaming ? Did I really see her ? But there was the memory of the soft patter of footsteps to convince her . The light , clear splash in the river that had been in her dream and yet had awakened her . The footsteps running across the grassy lawn . The clouds were shifting rapidly again ; already a band of shadow had crept across the terrace . She must hurry ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the balcony railing to where a clear patch of moonlight still lay upon the lawn , making a deep , sharp black shadow of a tall hibiscus there at the entrance of the garden path . And in that patch of moonlight stood John Campbell . His back was turned toward her . He was perfectly still and seemed to be watching something in the garden . His tall figurep162was unmistakable . The moonlight gleamed on his wide leather belt . Then the advancing edge of shadow reached him and swiftly blotted out hibiscus and silvery lawn and the silent , motionlessfigure . She leaned over the railing , intending to call to him . Then again she heard the sound of running footsteps on the grassy strip below  --  a rapidly diminishing sound that seemed to go toward the driveway . Then she could hear it no longer . It was all strange and unreal , like a shadow play , blotted out by darkness . If he went that way , though , he would meet the woman in white , coming from the opposite end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rouse the house and find the woman , and grasp at the clue which up to then had been so extraordinarily unsubstantial and evasive . She ran into her room just as someone knocked softly at the door . Her heart turned over with relief as the door opened and Michael 's voice said , " Vicky  --  are you awake ? " " Michael . . . " " Are you all right ? Where 's the light ? " " Michael , there was a woman on the terrace . Michael ... " She ran against a table with a lamp on it and fumbled for the light . He was in the doorway , his brown hair rumpled , a dressing-gown hanging over his shoulders . He took a long breath . " You 're all right then . Did you hear it too ? " " Michael , it was the maid again ! " " Maid ! Vicky , are you sure ? Where did she go ? " " Around toward the end of the house  --  the kitchen end . . . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just heard something  --  a door , I thought , and steps on the terrace . I  --  I had to make sure you were all right . I suddenly thought of those French doors onto the balcony . You 've got to keep them locked after this , Vicky . I  --  well  --  the maid ! We 'll get her this time ! Stay here , Vicky . . . " He whirled around and ran down the hall . She could n't stay there while they searched . He was poundingat Hollis ' door by the time Victoria had snatched up a dressing-gown and flung it over her white pajamas and slid her toes into fiat little red slippers and followed him . P163Hollis roused at once . He was indeed instantly awake and slipping a gun from a bureau drawer into his hand . Agnew awoke too and Bessie and Thalia . Afterward , Victoria tried to think whether or not one of them had seemed to awake too easily , too soon , too fully ; whether or not one of them had shown too little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mysterious maid . At the time there was nothing that indicated anything of the sort . Everyone was obviously in a state of undress  --  hastily snatched dressing-gowns , pajamas , and  --  in Bessie 's case  --  a silk and lace cover off a chaise longue  --  snatched up hurriedly and draped over her nightdress in a startling profusion of disorder , with a large blue taffeta bow hanging below her bare feet . Everybody was about as she would expect them to be  --  Hollis , pale and excited ; Agnew , blinking and full of theories ; Bessie , questioning and exclaiming ; Thalia , perfectly collected and cool , but joining in the search . It was a real search . They undertook it almost in a body . They searched the house , although , that night , they found every door locked . And when Victoria told them she had seen John Campbell standing there in the moonlight , Hollis and Michael went to find him , too . They shouted his name and went down the driveway to find his car . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and certainly his car was not there . And neither was the maid . Eventually , they awoke Ernestine and Jody and Lilibelle . Their rooms were in the little L beyond the kitchen and above the drive where it circled in front of the door . None of them had seen or heard anything . They were bewildered and sleepy and , as far as anyone could tell , they were telling the truth . Lilibelle , hearing of the maid , turned a kind of grape color , and instantly began to cry . " It was n't me , Mr. Hollis , " she sobbed . " It was n't me ! Please do n't tell Mr. Beasley it was me . He 's so p'sistent ! " " It was n't you , Lilibelle , " said Victoria . " I saw her , and it  --  was n't you .  --    " Well , then who was it ? " said Bessie , rolling her great dark eyes almost as vehemently as Lilibelle . " I do n't know . I just saw her like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . " " So she does exist , " said Agnew . " You see , I was right . It must be the same woman . " In the end they were no wiser than that . Search disclosed neither the mysterious maid nor any evidence of her visit . And John Campbell might have been a mirage . Hollis was inclined to doubt that she saw him at r I. " Where did he go , then , if you saw him ? Where 's his car ? Why was he here at that time of night ? " And , as she could n't , naturally , reply , he added , his light-blue eyes very cold , with hard , shiny black pupils , " I think you just saw a shadow . " " I heard the footsteps , " said Michael . " So someone did cross the terrace . " " Who ? " said Hollis . And again there was no answer . Eventually , since , as Bessie said , no one was hurt and nothing had happened , they did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police . Hollis and Michael took up their post in the morning room in case the visitor returned . This was a strategic post since , when the room was darkened , they had a view of the terrace , the front door , and the stairway . " We 'll stay awake and watch , " said Hollis , and put the revolver on the arm of his chair . The rest of them , there being nothing else to do , drifted back to bed . Michael , questioned , had not heard the splash in the river that Victoria was so sure had awakened her and , lying in bed watching the shifting clouds , she decided that that , really , might have been only a part of her dream . Nothing in the house apparently was disturbed . Certainly , as Bessie had said , nobody was hurt , by which she meant that no one had been murdered . It was a rather horrible thought . She remembered what Michael had said about the French doors leading upon the balconyand got up again and closed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her life , locked the door leading from her room into the hall . Although when she opened it for a momentP165she could hear a murmur from below that meant that Hollis and Michael were still discussing the mysterious , and apparentlypurposeless , visitation . It was then that Victoria , in spite of herself , began to questionwhether or not one of them  --  Thalia or Bessie , Ernestine or Lilibelle  --  had shown the faintest indication of knowledge . Or for that matter any of the men ; a man could have dressed himself for purposes of disguise in a maid 's uniform . And she had had only that glimpse of the vanishing figure  --  too rapid a glimpse to permit her to identify it even if it had been someone she knew . But there had been time , she decided , for any of them to enter the house ( by a door , perhaps the kitchen entrance , which could have been unlocked from the inside before leaving the house ) and come upstairs . She had listened and stared toward the spot where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes . She had stopped , naturally , when she saw Major Campbell . Oh , yes , there 'd been time ; time even for Michael , if he 'd hurried . Time even for anyone to get rid of a disguise which might have been assumed in case , on that night of shifting sudden light , someone was watching , as she had watched . It did not , however , prove that any of them had done so . Besides , Agnew had seen her going up the stairs the night ofthe murder . In the house , walking coolly up the stairs as if sheknew her way , and certainly had some purpose ! That , too ; in its way was a queerly terrifying thought . Walkingup the stairs , coming from nowhere , vanishing into nothing . In the end , however , if it did nothing else , the incident of the night underlined the attack upon Agnew at the door of the pump house . It left no doubt in anybody 's mind about that . But then , who was it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least two occasions , to the house ? Someone who came and went freely . Someone who searched Clistie 's room in the full light of day  --  and who struck swiftly , murderously , almost within a stone 's throw of the house . There was , obviously , no real police guard about the place . That was because Beasley believed the murderer would not dare strike again . The next night , she resolved , she would ask for a police guard . She went to sleep however with an uneasy conviction that bolts and bars and police were not likely to be of much use . As Clistie had said , the place was so big , with the pine woods  --  and the river . Morning brought the news of the attack upon Colonel Galant . Morning , indeed , brought many things , for it was a day of swiftly moving events . It was hot again that morning , with a mist over the river rising up toward a gray , pearly sky and the roses drooping in the garden . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held  --  two inquests really , one upon the death of Joan Green and one upon the death of Clistie Forbes . But that was later in the day . The first thing that happened was the arrival of Major Campbelland the State 's Attorney . Bessie burst into Victoria 's room with the news . She was already dressed  --  after a fashion , that is . The most charitable conclusion was that she 'd flung on the first clothing that came to hand . She wore a beige chiffon afternoon dress , dirty white sports shoes and a knitted purple beret . Coral necklaces and great gold bracelets jangled with the speed of her entrance . " Vicky , Vicky , wake up ! Somebody shot at Bruce ! Last night . At camp . No  --  no , do n't look like that , he 's not much hurt . " She put her thumb on the bell . " I 'll ring for your breakfast . You 'll have to get up right away . They 're here . Major Campbelland Beasley . And we 've all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a double inquest . And Vicky , it was John Campbelllast night  --  the man you saw ! He said so just now . He was here . He drove here after the attack on Bruce , but must have left just as you saw him . He says he did n't see the maid , and he wants to question you about it . He 's already talked to Michael and to me  --  but of course I did n't know anything  --  and to Lilibelle and Ernestine . Nobody knows anything .... " " Bessie , " said Victoria trying to pin her down to facts and speaking very distinctly , " What about Bruce ? Is he hurt ? " " Bruce ! " said Bessie , as if she 'd forgotten . " Oh , yes , ofP167course , Bruce . Not at all . Well , that is , I believe he was shot through the shoulder  --  or intercostal muscles or something . Through the window of his office . It was about twelve thirty and his orderly heard the shot . It was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Colonel in the hospital right there and nobody is to know of it ; that is , naturally , the doctors and nurses know , and they told us , but we 're to keep it quiet . It 's Bruce 's orders . Anyway , the orderly  --  he was in the outer office  --  ran to pick him up and Bruce sent him for the doctor and Major Campbell . Major Campbell came here as soon as he was sure Bruce was all right and they 'd got the doctor . " Bessie stopped and took a rather unsteady breath . " It 's not very nice , Vicky , but the fact is he seems to think one of us  --  us , my dear  --  drove out to the camp , managed somehow to get into the camp through some of the unfinished construction , and shot Bruce . Because of Clistie and  --  and Joan Green . He feels there 's some connection apparently . I 'm sure I do n't know what . You 'd better hurry . " She waited , though , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hand touched . It was merely lucky that her wardrobe was not of the liveliness that distinguished Bessie 's . She came out of the dressing room fastening a cool gray linen dress with a starched lace collar . " Will Bruce get well ? " " Oh , yes , " said Bessie . " He 's not hurt much . If only  --  well , " her dark eyes clouded . She gave Victoria a defiant look . " If only they do n't blame , Hollis ! Hollis does have a 45 . He had it with him last night . He gave it to Beasley this morning . " Someone knocked , and she said , " Here 's Lilibelle with your breakfast . " But it was n't Lilibelle ; it was Michael . And he , too , had news . Michael looked tired ; his smile was , as always , reassuring and cool , but his gray eyes were worried . He came to Victoria and took her hand . " You 've heard about Colonel Galant ? " " Michael , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little and looked down at the sapphire , still on her hand . She 'd forgotten it , she realized suddenly ; she must return it to him . But not with Bessie standing there , watching ,   ready to ask questions . He said , " Soldiers in a camp do not take pot shots at their commanding officer . It 's one of those things that simply is n't done . " " But Bruce  --  surely they ca n't think it has any real connection with  --  with Clistie . " " It 's the girl 's murder that connects the thing with Camp Blakoe . At least , that 's what they think . And from what Hollis says , it seems to have been Colonel Galant who started an investigation into any possible plot for obtaining military information . Colonel Galant started the investigation and last night he was shot . " Bessie said angrily , " But they need n't come here ! " She stopped and thought and said with an air of triumph , " Besides , there are sentries ! At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No one could have got past them . " Michael , turning Victoria 's ring so the lights in it moved , shook his head . " I 'm afraid someone could if he knew the camp very well . . . " he began , and Lilibelle arrived with the tray , her face sulky . Agnew followed her into the room , hands in his pockets , his face , too , rather sulky . Lilibelle put the tray on the low table , did not reply to Victoria 's good morning , and stopped in the doorway . " All I have to say is , " she announced , " there 's plenty of other jobs . A girl do n't have to stay where there 's murders all the time . A girl do n't have to answer questions all the time , either . And that goes for you , too , Mr. Agnew ! " Bessie gasped , " Why , Lilibelle . . . But Lilibelle had flounced away . Agnew said gloomily , " All I asked her was whether she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just occurred to me . Well , Mike  --  they have n't arrested you yet . " " No , " said Michael . " Why , Agnew , what do you mean ? " cried Bessie . Michael sat down beside Victoria . " Here , Vicky , eat your breakfast while it 's hot . " " Michael . . . " " They wo n't arrest me , " he said calmly . " It 's like this . There is an unguarded area of the road near the incompleted end ofP169the camp ; it 's not the regular way , it 's a new temporary road , built for construction , past the unfinished magazine area . If one knew it and knew the way they think it might conceivably have been possible to avoid sentries . And  --  well , it seems that after the Colonel was shot , our little friend , John Campbell , drove here .. . " Hell for leather , " said Agnew sotto voce . " Oh , be still , Agnew , " snapped Bessie . " Go on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Michael , still smiling a little , but his eyes sober , " the engine of my car was warm . They 're getting fingerprints from it now  --  the wheel and the door and the handle and all . They 'll find mine , naturally . Probably whoever drove it wore gloves and they 'll find only mine . The keys were in the car . I left them there so the boy  --  one of Judson 's henchmen ... " " Albert , " said Agnew. " ... could put it in the garage . The garage is some distance from the house and apparently was n't locked .. . Agnew interrupted again . " It is supposed to be locked , but Albert does n't always do it . Anybody could have come in from the road  --  he 'd only have to pass Judson 's cottage and Judson never pays any attention to anybody coming in the gate . Especially at night . He 's got a deaf ear , " said Agnew practically . " And sleeps with it up . " Bessie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? " Michael shrugged . " Even if the car had been driven , it does n't mean that it was taken to Camp Blakoe ; or that whoever shot Colonel Galant took it there . Here ... " He poured coffee for her . " Sugar ? Cream ? Now drink that , like a good girl . " Agnew said abruptly , " Vicky , what slippers did you wear on Monday night ? " " Slippers ? Why , I . . . Michael said quickly , " Let her have her breakfast , Agnew . " " Now , what is it ? " demanded Bessie . " Nobody asked me if I drove Michael 's car to camp and shot Bruce . And nobody asked me anything at all about slippers . What do you mean , Agnew ? What slippers ? Whose slippers ? "   " I think you 'd better tell her , Mike , " said Agnew uneasily . " Give her time to  --  well , give her time . " Agnew was worried , too . The freckles stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was either sick or worried and his light Steane eyes were anxious and peering . Michael said , " It 's the slipper heel , Vicky ; or rather the mark of the slipper heel that they found in the pine woods . You see  --  well , that package wrapped in newspaper that Beasley took away with him was .. . " Was one of your gold slippers ! It had mud on the heel , " burst in Agnew . " And after he took it away he had somebody do a soil test on it , or analysis or something , and Beasley says it 's the same kind of mud as that on the river bank and he wants to know how it got there . The troopers , when they searched the house the afternoon we went to Camp Blakoe , missed it . Beasley found it yesterday . He questioned the servants ; you have n't put on a dinner dress since Clistie was killed ; you have n't worn evening slippers since Monday night . Vicky , where did you get mud on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . " That then was why Beasley had made such a point of her statement that she had not gone to the pine woods on Monday night . Would you swear to it ? he 'd said . And his long , yellow face had looked satisfied , vaguely triumphant as the stenographermade a record of her reply . That was so , later , at a trial , he would try to prove perjury . " But I  --  I did n't go to the pine woods . There could n't be mud on my slipper ! I . . . " Michael cut in swiftly , " Victoria was n't wearing gold slippers on Monday night . " " That 's what Beasley asked me , " said Agnew . " I told him I did n't remember . " Bessie said , " Michael 's right , of course ! She wore her yellow dress and there were yellow slippers to match . Wait . . . " She hurried into the dressing room . Agnew muttered gloomily , " My guess all along has been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girl and Clistie ; shot at Colonel Galant . No possible connection between them all.  |p171Somebody  just likes to murder . " Bessie returned , flushed from bending over the shoe cupboard , with a pair of small yellow sandals in her hand . " Here they are , " she said . " See , there 's no mud on them ! " Victoria had a little mental vision of herself descending the stairway with the wrong slippers  --  the gold slippers  --  showing briefly , one and then the other , below her yellow skirt . She must have started to speak , for Michael put his hand down hard over her own . He said positively , " Victoria wore yellow slippers that night . She looked so pretty  --  I remember noticing the slippers . You are quite right , Bessie . " And Lilibelle came sulkily to the door again to say that Major Campbell would like to see Miss Victoria in the library . " Right away , " said Lilibelle . Michael went down the stairs with her . " Tell him you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I did n't . I . . . " Tell him so , anyway , " said Michael . But when Victoria went into the library , John Campbell 's first question had nothing to do with the gold slipper stained with mud . Instead he showed her , in a crumpled heap on the library table , a maid 's white uniform . It had been found , he said , thrust behind some shrubbery close to the front door . And he wanted to know , he told her , watching her , whether it was the dress the woman she had seen the previous night had been wearing.  |p172IT  WAS a short but in its way important talk that she had that morning with Campbell  --  in the library again with the windows open , but not a breath of air stirring the heavy curtains . He questioned her but talked too  --  directly , as if he counted on her understanding . He smoked , he paced the floor , he came to sit with one knee over the edge of the table . He took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pad of paper . tHe said rather wearily when she looked at the dress , that naturally she could n't be sure , but did she think it looked like the dress the woman she had seen had worn . " I do n't know . It looks like one of Ernestine 's uniforms . But then they can be bought at almost any department store . " He nodded and got out cigarettes and offered her one before he lighted one himself . " Yes , I know . Ernestine says it belongs to her , but she does n't know how it got there in the shrubbery . The laundry mark is right and she says anybody that got into the house could have taken it from a stack of newly arrived laundry that was delivered by truck from Ponte Verde late yesterday afternoon . Lilibelle was supposed to put it away and did n't , so it was left , like that , on a shelf of the linen closet off the butler 's pantry . The point is , of course , the womanP173you saw may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true , the maid Agnew and Bayne saw could have been the same woman , wearing a maid 's uniform for the same reason . Disguise . But it ... " He frowned for a moment at the rug . " It does n't  --  match up , somehow . It does n't seem right . It does n't fit . An outsider could have got into the house . Jody says he never used to lock the front door because he never knew when people were coming home at night and they  --  meaning Hollis , I suppose , or you  --  never remembered latch keys . So a long time ago he got out of the habit of locking the front door . Since the murders he has made a point of locking all the doors  --  but they can always be unlocked from the inside , and besides "  --  he said quickly  --  " there are all the windows . There 's always a way in or out of a house if somebody really wants to find it . " He got up impatiently , walked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down into her eyes , " Victoria , what about this gold slipper ? A slipper of yours  --  perhaps Agnew or Bayne told you  --  with mud on it . I  --  please believe me , I did n't know about it last night . I did n't know what Beasley was driving at with his questions , getting you definitely on record with a statement that he hoped later to prove false . He 's gone now ; had to go to Ponte Verde . He told me to question you about it . He . . . " He hesitated . Was he giving her time to think , she wondered ; time to prepare an answer ? He sat down on the edge of the table again beside her , and , rather absently , took her hand  --  her left hand as it happened and as Michael had done . He looked at it and turned the ring on it slowly . " You see , I 'm forced to be on Beasley 's side . It 's my job ; Colonel Galant gave me orders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along with Beasley  --  with his consent . His permittingme to know what goes on , his giving me what evidence he has , depends mainly upon a kind of  --  courtesy . But it 's his case , and it 's a chance to solve a case I could n't solve . That is , of course , the murder of Henry Frame . Nobody , now , doubts that it was murder ; but there 's no more evidence than there ever was . "   " You believe that  --  all this  --  is a result of Henry 's death ? " she asked him . " I believe that when we have the answer to Clistie 's death , we 'll have the answer to Henry 's , too , " he said obliquely . " Certainly Clistie was murdered and Joan Green , and it 's rather against the law of averages  --  three murders without some connection between them . Murder is , luckily , not a usual kind of thing , " he said rather dryly , and turned her ring thoughtfully . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't really see alike . " " He thinks I did it , " said Victoria soberly . He glanced at her quickly . " It 's the concrete  --  what he calls jury evidence . When Frame was killed , too , the evidence pointed toward you . I "  --  he looked back at the ring  --  " I did n't want to think it was you . Even then . And now I . . . " He stopped abruptly , relinquished her hand and got up . " Beasley believes Hollis ' story implicitly  --  or says he does . He agrees that the murder of Joan Green does seem to connectthe affair with Camp Blakoe , but he believes that her murder was in the nature of an accident . That is , that she saw or knew too much through her friendship with Hollis . He may be right . " He walked to the window and back and said , " You said Clistie was wearing blue slippers when you saw her in the hall  --  after you heard the scream . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Yes . Turquoise . She 'd got them to go with the brown dress . " " Turquoise , " he said thoughtfully . " She was wearing them still when she was found , you know . I looked at them this morning , when Beasley told me he 'd had the mud on your gold slipper analyzed , and that it was the same as the soil along the bank where the heel mark was found . I thought it ' might have been Clistie 's slipper that made the mark . It would fit it all right , but then most evening slippers have heels that would fit it  --  or almost . Her slippers were soiled , damp-stained , as if she 'd been walking in the dew . There could have been mud on them , and she could have wiped it ( )  --  . Afterward , I suppose . "   " I did n't go to the pine woods that night . " He said suddenly and very directly , " I believe you , Victoria . I 'd better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slippers you were wearing Monday night . Agnew , you see , had said he did n't know . Bayne caught on apparently from the manner of Beasley 's question and said you were n't wearing gold slippers that night ; that he 'd particularly noticed because you "  --  a little tight mask seemed to slip down over his face  --  " because you were looking especially beautiful that night at dinner . As soon as Beasley let the cat out of the bag and said there was mud on your gold slipper , Bayne swore up and down that you did n't wear gold slippers that night . But then  --  well , you see , Beasley had Thalia Frame in ; she said gold . " Tell them yellow , Michael had said . Well , it would n't do any good now . But John Campbell did n't give her a chance to lie . He said gravely , " You see , Victoria , if anybody remembered the evidence against you , and the lack of evidence against anybody else at the time of Henry Frame 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to arrange evidence against you now . Such as your belt . Your slipper . " He paced the floor again , his black head bent and his hands clasped behind him . " It would mean an enemy , you see . Somebody who really wants you to be charged with murder . " Agnew had said that too . And there was the wedding dress . He came back to sit on the table edge and watch her while she told him of the dress . His hazel eyes were very bright and intent , but when she finished she could n't tell what he thought . He said , after a moment , " It might have delayed the wedding , of course . On the other hand , you could have been married in another dress . Do you know when it was done ? " " No . But the state troopers searched the house the afternoon I went to Camp Blakoe to see Colonel Galant and you . And yesterday Beasley searched it too . Surely they would have seen if it had been cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' 11 find out . You say there was a cover over it ; they might have merely glanced at the cover or at enough of the dress to see what it was , instead of removing the cover as you did . " He lighted another cigarette and said ,   through smoke , " When did you look at it last  --  I mean before last night . " She thought back . " Monday morning . I tried it on . " Clistie had crept around her , she remembered , adjusting the hem , pleased with the dress and Victoria in it . And a sudden little memory floated apart from all the things that had happened directly afterward . She said slowly , " I think Clistie must have worked on the dress that afternoon , for that night there were scissors .. . " Scissors ! Where ? " " On the floor . At least I  --  I think so . It was dark in my room ; but as I went to the balcony my foot struck them ... . " When ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean . " " Before . Oh , a long time before . " " Did you pick them up ? " " No . " " Did you see them again ? What did you do ? " " Why , nothing . I 'd forgotten , you see . I never thought of it again until now . I suppose someone else must have picked them up and put them away . I do n't remember seeing them at all . But . . . " " Well ? " " The scissors made me think of it . It 's nothing really but  --  well , that night just before I heard the girl scream I thought that someone came in my room . I was so sure I went in and looked . No one was there . I went back to the balcony . It was such a trivial thing .... " " How long before you heard the scream ? " " Not long . Only a moment or two , I 'm sure . I had barely got out on the balcony . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't know  --  that is , I do n't remember . " " Probably somebody else did remember . " He looked down at her hand , on the table . The blue sapphire glittered , and he said suddenly , " I understand your wedding is postponed . " And before she could reply , he walked to the window and said rather quickly , over his shoulder , " About last night . They say that you saw me ? "  | " Yes . I started to call to you  --  to tell you about the woman I saw  --  but then you were gone . " " I do n't suppose it would have made any real difference . Whoever it was had had time to "  --  he paused , and then said  --  " to get away . Bayne 's car was out last night . There 's no doubt of that . I came here as soon as I could . " " Why ? " " Obviously  --  to catch Hollis . If it was Hollis . You see . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see , it 's the only  --  at least it 's the most probable motive for the attack upon Colonel Galant . Day before yesterday he started an inquiry into any possible activity in the way of attempted espionage . Joan Green was the link to Camp Blakoe . She was murdered here . Hollis knew her . As soon as I was sure Colonel Galant was not hurt much , I came here . I was too late to catch whoever drove the car . But the engine , as I expect they told you , was still warm . The car had been taken out . In case somebody  --  whoever drove it  --  was still around , I took a look around the place . The house was dark and apparently everybody was sleeping . It would n't do much good to rout everybody out and ask them point-blank if they 'd been asleep . Naturally they 'd say yes  --  especially whoevertook the shot at Colonel Galant  --  if , " he said quickly , forestalling the words on her lips , " if it was somebody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done just that , but I thought I heard a noise somewhere . . . " " I heard it . A splash and then somebody running . And then a little later the woman on the terrace . We looked , but .... " He nodded . " They told me . Everybody peacefully asleep . Especially Hollis . And that maid 's uniform in the shrubbery this morning . It could have been put there any time , of course . And yet . . . " He stopped again for a long time , and then said suddenly , " You see , Hollis could have heard about  --  well , about Cara Nome ( whatever it is , and if it 's anything ) that afternoon in Colonel Galant 's office . The window was open , the fan was going , you were sitting near the window and , in order to make his voice heard over the fan , Colonel Galant practically shouted . Hollis was n't drilling that afternoon . I found that out this morning . He was sent to the administration building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outside of the window . Thalia Frame could have heard it ; she was strolling around outside the prohibited area , it seems , alone . She said , when I asked her , that she did n't know one building from another at camp and does n't know whether she was near Colonel Galant 's office or not . I did n't tell any of them why I asked . Agnew says he and Bayne drove around over camp a little . He wanted to show Bayne as much as they were permitted to see of the camp ; then they came back and parked in front of the administration office . And Agnew went , he says , to get Coca-Colas for them all . The nearest stand is down the road . Conceivably he could have passed the Colonel 's office , though he says he did n't . Conceivably , while he was gone , Bayne could have strolled that way and heard what the Colonel said . Conceivably , too , " he said wearily , " none of them did . Let 's have your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean . What exactly did you hear ? " She told him , quickly . " The splash in the river could have been a dream , I suppose , " he said . " Yet , running footsteps coming up from the river . . . " He paused and said thoughtfully , " It was an army 45 , you know . The gun with which Colonel Galant was shot ; they 've got out the bullet . But if the revolver was tossed into the river , we 'll never find it . They 're doing what they can do at camp ; but identifying one revolver in an army camp is almostcomparable to the needle in the haystack . Well , not quite that really  --  but nevertheless I think that probably there 's another clue that is no clue at all . I wish I knew .... " He sat on the edge of the table and swung his long legs as boyishly as Agnew , his face intent and concentrated . " I wish I knew whether or not it was Clistie that telephoned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  what had happened that was so urgent . I wish I knew who is stacking up evidence against you , and exactly why . I wish I knew more about Clistie 's dress and why it was on that girl . I wish I knew the meaning of Cara Nome  --  is it really poison to somebody , and why , and what connection is there between that and Camp Blakoe  --  if there is one . And I wish I knew the motive . " P179He laughed shortly , staring at the rug . " That 's  --  how many  --  five main lines of inquiry . Somewhere in the answers to those questions is the answer we 've got to have . Motive is the big one . Motive . . . " He sprang off the table and began to pace up and down again , his head bent . Finally , he said , " Let me see the wedding dress . " She brought it to him  --  wrapping it in its muslin cover and hurrying along the hall and stairs . His face hardened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's so senseless , " she whispered . " Yes , " he said briefly and wrapped it up again . " Put it away . " That was all he said of it . Bessie came to the door and said the car was waiting , and it was time to go to Ponte Verde . She bustled away again , and John Campbell said , " You 'll have to go . About Cara Nome  --  it seems such a senseless thing really . Yet it worried Clistie  --  or something about it . And it 's still on Colonel Galant 's mind . I spent most of the day yesterday looking through the files of the transcripts Joan Green made and found exactly nothing but a guarded mention or two of the radio equipment , nothing that could be of any possible value as news to a foreign agent . So far as I 'm concerned that 's out as a motive . Completely . But  --  there was nothing about this Cara Nome affair either . I 've got girls now , today , going through all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She shook her head . " I asked Agnew , too . He did n't know . " Someone honked impatiently outside . " Oh , by the way , " he said . " I 've asked Beasley to put a policeman or two in the house tonight . It 's safer . I may be at the inquest . " He was gone when she came downstairs a moment later , after having put the torn wedding dress back in a drawer and locked it . She had her hat in her hand . Bessie and the others were already in the long town car which I-Iollis was driving . The inquest , or rather the double inquest , was from the beginningan obvious formality . It took place in the coroner 's courtroom in the little , vine-hung Ponte Verde courthouse with its damp-stained walls . Beasley was there but sat for the most part with his long legs crossed , a not over-clean white canvas oxford wagging nervously , and his chin in his hand .   Major Campbell did not come , although Victoria looked for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door opened or closed . It was not pleasant . And it reminded all of them too strongly of those other times when they had sat in that room , listening to a much more detailed inquiry into the death of Henry Frame . Little in the way of evidence came out . The two women had died violent deaths , and that was all . But in neither case was there a verdict . Adjournments were again , as Agnew said on the way home , in order . " They did n't ask us to identify the dress or Victoria 's belt or anything , " he said morosely . " All they did was give Beasley the formality of a go-ahead signal . " It was still suffocatingly hot and breathless when they reached the house , with the long , gray-green wisps of Spanish moss drooping languidly from the liveoaks and the river as quiet as a painted river . Bruce Galant was better . Bessie telephoned to the hospital and was told that , although she was not permitted to talk to him . Late in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That was because Agnew found what he found . That was a slip of paper , torn from a memorandum pad . It had on it a telephone number , Ponte Verde 3830 and , below it , in Clistie 's handwriting , the two words , Cara Nome . P181THERE was no doubt of its being in Clistie 's handwriting . Agnew brought it to Victoria , dancing with excitement . She was then at the telephone . Everyone had known Clistie 's wishes about her funeral . She had often told them she wanted to be buried quietly , " without fuss and feathers , " in the little Vermonttown where she 'd been born . It seemed queer , thought Victoria , to make arrangements like that for Clistie  --  little , efficient Clistie . Later , when the investigation was over , she herself would go to the little Vermont village and see that things had been done as she wanted them done . All Clistie 's life had been bound up with the Steanes . She had a few old friends , fewer relatives . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What are you crying again for ? " he said , stopping short , and then , in his excitement , did n't wait for an answer . " Look , " he cried . " Look  --  it 's in Clistie 's writing . It 's the telephone number of the Ponte Verde hotel where Joan Green lived . And it "  --  he lowered his voice with a quick look down the hall as if to be sure no one was listening  --  " and it 's Cara Nome . So she did know something ! And , Vicky , that is n't all . I found it just now on the memorandum pad where Clistie used to write the grocery orders . Well , since she  --  since Mon- day , Ernestine 's been making the grocery orders and she did n't use that memorandum pad . Just used her memory , she says . But the point is , this was written after five o'clock Monday because . . . " Agnew 's eyes were sharp and bright behind his thick glasses . " Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the order when the groceries came so as to check the items . And she did Monday , as usual . So the pad was clear until  --  well , until some time later when Clistie came to the kitchen and wrote that . So it proves  --  well , it does n't really prove it , but it looks as if it might be so  --  that Clistie telephoned Joan Green , I mean . And maybe asked her to come . And maybe  --  well , pretty certainly , had the words Cara Nome on her mind . Now then , why ? " Victoria did n't know why . She looked at the scribbled fewwords . " We 'd better tell Colonel Galant , " she said slowly . Agnew looked at her sharply . His rather prominent ears allbut moved forward . " Why Colonel Galant ? " " Just  --  oh , because , " said Victoria . " Where is Hollis ? And Michael ? " " Swimming , " said Agnew . " They just went down to the pier . Thalia 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but so far she 's sitting on the pier swinging her legs . They said to tell you to come down and take a swim too . I 'm going ... . " No , " said Victoria . " You 're coming with me . " It was an odd impulse of secrecy , she thought , as she backed out the old station wagon that she always drove . It looked very small and shabby in the long garage between the big , black town car , and Michael 's gray coupe . Agnew wanted to drive and was as usual restrained with difficulty and contented himself with smoking a forbidden cigarette . " I can drive perfectlywell , " he said . " And you know it . I guess the police have finished examining Michael 's car . They swarmed over it like bees early this morning  --  fingerprints and what-not . Say , Vicky , what do you suppose she meant by Cara Nome ? I mean , I do n't see why she would telephone to Joan Green about s  --  well , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and did n't know one song from another . " That day one of the sentries at the gate into Camp BlakoeP183did some telephoning before he admitted them . At the hospital , while Agnew waited in the station wagon , Victoria was taken to see Colonel Galant only after the nurse had taken het name , disappeared for a long time and then returned . " I he 'll see you , " she said shortly , " but for only a few minutes . " She ever ! Victoriawith frank curiosity and escorted her along covered runwaysto the low new building in which there weir private rooms . Colonel Galant was well-guarded . There were soldiers ( on duty , businesslike and alert ) in the corridor outside his room , and through the windows Victoria could see other soldiers , doing a steady sentry-go up and down . He was sitting up in bed , however , looking more annoyed than ill and signing a large stack of letters , in spite of his bandaged shoulder . " I 'm all right , " he said testily , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a pretty pass when the commander of an army post gets shot . If I had n't heard a kind of sound at the window and turned around , it might have killed me . It was a near thing , Vicky , and no mistake . I could n't get to the window in time to see anybody , either . We 've turned the camp inside out of course  --  discreetly and all that  --  but have n't found any real evidence yet . I am convinced it 's nobody in the camp ; it 's someone  --  and something completely outside . Well , well , Vicky  --  any news ? " She told him quickly . She showed him the slip of paper and explained . " I see . Yes  --  yes , I see , " he murmured thoughtfully . " Cara Nome again . Yes , that was worrying her , Victoria . But why ? That 's what I 'd like to know . Why ? And why does it ring some sort of bell in my own memory ? It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble . And it 's not , I assure you , a face powder . Or that blasted song ! " He brooded angrily for a moment . " This young Campbell seems to think I ought to he able to remember . But , my God , I 've got other things to do . . . . " He gave a harassed glance at the stack of letters on the bed table . " Well , Vicky  --  thanks . I 'll give this to Campbell . Bret you did right to come to me . Kiss me , my dear , and thanks for coming . And better not take any chances . It 's a  --  a damnedP184nasty business , " he said gloomily . At the door he called her back . " Look here , my dear  --  you 're keeping your ears and eyes open regarding Hollis , are n't you ? " " Yes , but he . . . " Now , now , you do n't know whether he did or not . Somebodyhad Bayne 's car out last night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  do n't you ?  --  except maybe Bessie . Not , " he said hastily , " that I think you drove over here and got past the sentries along the new road and shot me . But Hollis  --  Hollis did know that girl . You ca n't get around that . " She went away , again escorted by the starchy , curious little nurse . Driving slowly home through the hot , still air , she thought of Hollis . She had felt , always , that she knew him so well . Yet apparently she had n't known him at all . There was his friendship for Joan Green of which she knew nothing ; there was his driving ambition and love for the Steane Mills which Agnew had seen but , to which , again , she 'd been blind . Probably there were many other things going on behind Hollis ' light Steane eyes which were equally imperceptible to her own observation . Certainly she 'd had more than once an odd impression of evasiveness , of guarded silence , of something withheld . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talkative . " What 'd the Colonel say ? " inquired Agnew eagerly . " He said ... " She avoided two cows and a truckload of soldiers . The soldiers waved cheerily at her and she waved back . " He said he 'd tell Major Campbell . " " Oh , " said Agnew and shot a glance at her . " I suppose Major Campbell 's on the job on account of this Green girl . " " I suppose so . " " Dear me , " said Agnew , " how discreet we are ! Listen , Vick , I may be near-sighted but I can still see anything if it 's right under my nose . " He lapsed into a sulky but a thoughtful silence . They arrived home to find Michael and Hollis in from their swim , on the porch with Bessie who was surrounded by newspapers . Thalia lay languidly back in a big chair , her smooth dark head beautiful against the yellowp185cushion , watching the river with dark , unfathomable eyes . Hollis looked up sharply to ask where they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Agnew shortly . He disappeared soon after that . Victoria caught a glimpse of him strolling moodily , head bent , hands in his pockets , toward the garden where presently he vanished behind the screen of shrubbery and hedges . She did n't see him again until dinner was half over . He came in hurriedly but as unobtrusively as possible as if in the hope of escaping Bessie 's notice . He did not , naturally , succeed . Six lanky feet of  --  mainly -- bones is difficult to dissemble . Bessie , however , was too dispirited herself to do more than hiss at him as he slid into his place . " Slinking , " she said sibilantly , " and sliding in late . Did you wash your hands ? " Agnew , looking guilty , waved away soup . He also looked still very thoughtful and presently , when Bessie 's attention had been diverted to a discussion of the heat , said in an undertone to Victoria , " Judson wants to see you . It 's about a spade . " He winked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helping of potatoes . " Spade ? " said Bessie . " What spade ? " " It 's a Scotch joke , " said Agnew rapidly . " Calling a spade a spade . You 've heard it , Mother . Everybody 's heard . . . Bessie opened her mouth angrily , and Agnew went on hurriedly , " Hollis , how long is your leave and how did you talk the Colonel into seeing that you got it ? Did he call up your regimental boss and say you were to have it ? " It distracted Bessie , and Victoria did not listen to Hollis ' reply . If Judson wanted to talk to her about a spade , it was because he knew something of the spade Clistie had taken and not returned . She resolved to find the gardener immediately after dinner . It happened , however , she did not see Judson then . Instead she made another trip to the Ponte Verde courthouse . Beasley sent for her . Agnew came to tell her . That was perhaps half an hour or more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the porch and had walked along the winding driveway , shadowy already with the approach of another still , cloudy night , to Judson 's cottage . He lived neatly and precisely alone , cooking his own meals , methodically taking care of the little house himself . He was n't there when she reached the cottage and knocked and called to him , but he had n't come in yet to cook his dinner , for the little kitchen , when she opened the door and looked in was tidy and clean . She sat down on the vine-sheltered step to wait for him . It was very quiet there , and the heavy shrubbery seemed to move stealthily closer to the cottage as the darkness grew . It was some distance from the house , too . Her heart jumped and stopped as Agnew came loping around the house from the driveway , before his white shirt and glasses gleamed out of the dusk and revealed who it was . " I knew I 'd find you here , " he said . " Did you see Judson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Ponte Verde . Right away . The State 's Attorney does . I do n't think you ought to go . " He argued about it passionately all the way back along the driveway to the house . Michael , too , who met them as they reached the door , was against it . " He 's questioned you enough . You 've told him everything you know . All he wants now is to trick you into some admission that gives him a handle for  --  well , arrest , maybe . Vicky , I 'm goingto telephone Gleason in New York and have him take the night plane . He can be here by morning , and you can let Beasley question you then to his heart 's content . Do n't go tonight , Vicky . " But Hollis , coming out from the house to find them standing there on the driveway arguing about it , said flatly that she 'd better go . " I talked to him when he rang up , " he said . " Maybe it 's only the heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't go , he 'll send troopers to bring you ; he said so . He 's in that frame of mind . After all , " said Hollis , " you do n't have to answer his questions . And you did n't murder Clistie or  --  or Joan . So you do n't have anything to be afraid of . " In the end Michael took her  --  in his gray coupe which , nowP187that they had finished with it , the police had told him he could use again . " Nice of them , " he said , driving swiftly through the dark , soft night with the lights making long lanes ahead of them . " Vicky , if it had n't been for all this we 'd have been  --  let me see  --  driving through Virginia about now , stopping tonight at some little inn in the mountains perhaps . . . " He reached for her hand and brought it to his lips . And then she took off the big sapphire . He refused at first to take it . And then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All right , " he said . " Wait till you see it on another girl 's finger . Then you 'll be sorry . " She thought swiftly , but did not say , that in that case she knew whose finger it would be . The little town , when they turned into the main street , was hot and crowded . Soldiers loitered along the sidewalks , stood in a cue at the motion-picture theatre , crowded the lighted little drug stores . They reached the courthouse and most of it was dark , but lights gleamed from the windows of Beasley 's office . A state trooper , hot and tired-looking , was waiting for them and took Victoria up the stairs . He would n't let Michael accompany her . Victoria had scarcely entered the shabby , bare little office , with its odors of stale tobacco smoke , and sweeping compound , its littered golden-oak desk , its green-shaded lights  --  and Beasley sitting at the desk  --  before she realized that Michael had been right . She ought not to have come ; she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For that night Beasley was determined upon making an arrest . She sat down where he told her to sit , in a small , golden-oak armchair , stiff and uncomfortable and directly under the light . The trooper went out and closed the door behind him . John Campbell was not there . No one was there but Beasley . And he , with a kind of simple , brutal directness set out to get her to confess . His yellow long face jutted out into the light . His little black eyes were as glittering and yet opaque as a snake 's . He thrust one clawlike , grasping hand toward her . " This is my case , " he said . " Campbell has his views . But I have mine . That girl Joan Green was accident ; she saw too much ; she was there  --  to meet young Isham , I expect  --  at the wrong time . I do n't know what happened to her own dress . It was n't burned  --  at least not in the house furnace . Even her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's in the river probably . But all that does n't matter . The point is , I 've got evidence . Real , material , jury evidence . And I 'm going to stick to it . " He paused and looked at her and said , " If you 'll confess now , it 'll save us both a lot of energy . " " Confess ! " " Sit down , " he said . And began . Beasley 's favorite method of questioning had always been accusation . When Victoria assayed a defense  --  such as the telephone number of the Ponte Verde hotel in Clistie 's writing , and the words Cara Nome below it ( for that implied , surely , something not yet known which might provide a motive for the murders ; it implied surely , if it did n't prove it , that Clistie had telephoned to Joan Green asking her to come ) , Beasley brushed it aside . When , rather desperately , she pointed out how foolish it would have been on her part to strew clues about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . " You 'd had some police experience . You thought we 'd reason that way  --  that you would n't be such a fool as to leave evidence that led directly to you . " " But the maid  --  the woman Agnew and Michael Bayne saw . The woman I saw ... " He laughed shortly . " The woman you heard about  --  one of your own maids probably . The woman that last night only you saw . Campbell was there on the place . You saw him , but you did n't speak to him . You did n't tell him a woman had just run along the terrace out of sight . You said nothing , because there was no woman . " He leaned forward . " Listen , Miss Steane , I'um not pretending every little unimportant detail of this case is clear to me ; there may be some that are never quite clearedP189up . That does n't matter . I know enough . You killed Henry Frame , and Clistie discovered it . You killed her , and that girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and you had to get rid of her , too . What did she see ? What did she hear ? Tell me the truth .... " " I am telling you the truth ... P190It WAS very hot . Insects buzzed against the black screens . The light from above , blazing down into her face was dazzling , confusing ; the air was stifling . Once Beasley poured himself a drink of water from the little cooler in the corner and brought a drink to her in a paper cup . " You could make it so much easier for both of us , " he said rather plaintively , " if you 'd just confess . " The distant street noises had stopped some time ago . It must be very late , she thought stupidly . But it was much later and Beasley was sitting wearily on the desk , his own face moist and yellow and haggard , when someonecame running up the stairs , his footsteps loud in the silence and flung open the door . It was Major Campbell . He gave her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Oh , it 's you . " " I 'll take her now . " " I 've not finished . " Major Campbell crossed to the desk so his face was in the light . His eyes were blazing ; his face a queer kind of gray below the tan . " I said I 'd take her now . " " Now , look here , John , " said Beasley , " you 've got no rightP191in my own office , too . " He got down rather hastily and sidled around behind the desk . " Now there 's no call to act like that . I have n't hurt the girl . " " Come on , Victoria . I 'll take you home . " " You ca n't do that , " said Beasley . " It 's my case . I only let you in on it because Colonel Galant requested it .. . . " You 've already made one arrest , " said John Campbell . " That ought to be enough for one night . " Beasley 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an arrest . And I 'm going to make another . That girl 's in this thing up to her pretty neck , and I 'm going to see that ... " Major Campbell leaned over the desk . She could n't see his face , only his broad shoulders . He said , rather quietly , really , " I 've told you , Eliot , I 'm taking her away now . You can questionher all you want to tomorrow  --  when she 's got a lawyer ; when she 's had a chance to rest . But I 'm taking her now . Do you want to try to stop me ? You 've got troopers downstairs ; one of them guarding the jail . All you have to do is call them . But it 's not going to sound very pretty when I tell what the trouble is about . " She could n't see Beasley , for John Campbell was between them . Who had already been arrested ? she thought numbly . Hollis ? Beasley said suddenly , " Oh , all right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fight about it . " He sounded fretful . He added , " If you do n't get any more information than I got out of her , you wo n't get much . " Major Campbell whirled around , came to Victoria and half lifted her to her feet . He picked up a crumpled , limp little handkerchief that , some time , she had dropped , and looked at it queerly , with a kind of frozen expression on his brown face . He put it in his pocket and put his arm around her and led her toward the door . His arm was very firm and steady . Beasley said , quite goodnaturedly , " See you in the morning , John , " as they left . Major Campbell said nothing . The little hall was deserted . No one was below either and , as they emerged into the hot night air , sweet-smelling and humid , he led her toward an army car parked at the entrance . She said , troubled and vaguely perplexed , " Michael said he would wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . A few street lights here and there made haloes of brightness that showed only empty streets and strips of pale sidewalks with here and there great overhanging liveoaks that made caves of shadow . But Michael 's long gray car was gone . John Campbell said , " I 'll take you home , " and took her to his own car , put her in it and got quickly into the driver 's seat beside her . He gave her a cigarette and lighted it before he started the car . They turned away from the courthouse and into the now almost empty main street . She said , after awhile , as if he 'd asked her , " I did n't . .. " " I know that . I told you this morning . " His voice sounded brusque and angry . " Beasley thinks I did . He has n't any doubt . He 's  --  honest . He would n't have tried to make me confess , if he had n't thought so . " John Campbell interrupted . His jaw looked stubborn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Michael was arrested . They  --  put his car in a garage for him . Beasley , it seems , had told the trooper who met you at the door of the courthousethat , if Bayne brought you , he was to arrest Bayne . Quietly . Without your knowing . " " Michael ! " " It was his car out at Camp Blakoe . They found tire marks . on the road they 're using for construction , near the new magazines . The only road anybody could have taken to get any where near the camp in such a way as to  --  with luck  --  manage to avoid a sentry . Tire marks , I mean , that correspond with , the tires on his car . And the only fingerprints they found were his and  --  on the handle of the right door a print of yours and two of Thalia 's . There are some smudges  --  such as might hav been made by anybody wearing gloves . But Beasley decided to arrest Bayne and did it . " " He  --  he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I suppose he was saving that bit of news for a coup de grace . When you were so exhausted that . . . Oh , well , " said John abruptly , " Beasley 's got his own little ways . " " Where is Michael ? I must see him . I must get a lawyer .. .. " P194liver any lunfoer . Instead , they sent a letter to the A.B.C . ( and a copyie.the Constructing Quartermaster  --  he has it on file and showed it , to me ) saying they could n't fill the contract and forfeitingit . But the curious thing about it is that the Cara Nome Company has vanished . As thoroughly as the vanishing maid . " " Vanished ! But there must be offices . What does Colonel Galant say ? " " Colonel Galant says , " said John rather grimly , " for me to find out who and what they are . He does n't say how . I got on r the long distance telephone . It was about that time that ColonelGalant told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if Clistie really did telephone Joan Green . And as if whatever she knew was recent knowledge  --  and so urgent that she could n't even wait till morning , but had to get hold of Joan Green instantly that night . But what was it ? " He avoided an oncoming car , negotiated a turn and said , " The Cara Nome letters were signed by one Philomel Jonson . The address was a post-office box in New York . I got Federal men working on it  --  rather Colonel Galant did . They 've had very little time . So far all we know is that the post-office box was given up some time ago . That there 's no construction companyof that name with a business address in New York . No address , no office , no Philomel Jonson , so far , who has any connection with it . Nothing . Except the Cara Nome Construction , Company got a contract and then gave it up and disappeared. , There 's no obvious motive ; there was nothing gained by it ; there was apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Company was n't paid a cent . So  --  there you are ! What 's back of it ? On the surface , it 's an utterly senseless , motiveless , useless thing . It ended almost before it began . " He lighted another cigarette . He went on , " It adds to the puzzle when you stop to think that the Cara Nome Company ca n't be phony . Philomel Jonson can be a phony name  --  sounds like it . The post-office box , the lack of street address , all that sounds phony . But the Cara Nome ' Company has got to exist ; it 's got to have , at least , a charter of . incorporation . Maybe nobody asked to see it  --  but nobody would dare take the chance of not having it . So we ought toP195have some news about it soon . If the company is legally incorporated , then the Secretary of State gave the charter aid will have the record of it . We do n't know what state ; we 're trying New York first . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we may be no wiser . " He stopped again and said after a moment or two , " We got hold of the officials of the A.B.C . Company who sublet the contract to the Cara Nome Company . They said that their policy , as suggested by the government , was to sublet as many contracts for material as possible to the smaller companies . In the case of a good-sized bid for any kind of work , a check for a percent of the amount of the bid accompanies it  --  if the bid is rejected , the check naturally is returned to the company making the bid . In this case it was different . The Cara Nome outfit , whatever it is , offered to supply a certain amount of lumber for ten thousand dollars . It was like a grocer offering to supply eggs . The A.B.C . was subleting a lot of small contracts ; they needed lumber and a prompt delivery ; everything was done at top speed . About all the Cara Nome lot would need would be , as I say , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be asked to show that . It was n't as if they were actually building anything and a question of their responsibility and past record was involved . " " I do n't believe the Steane Mills had any of the Camp Blakoe contracts , " she said . " If so , I did n't know of it . " " They did n't , " he said promptly . " Naturally , we looked through the records for any connection with the Steane Mills . There was n't any . Yet certainly Clistie knew something . If we could only reconstruct all of Clistie 's actions that day and that night . Victoria , was she in any way  --  oh , different ? Worried ? " A swift little memory of Clistie ( looking earnestly into the thicket of pines behind her , moving up the slope nearer the house , talking  --  strangely  --  of watchdogs ) returned to Victoria . She told him of it . And then , driving through the hot black night , following the lanes of light ahead of them , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything she could remember of the night of Clistie 's death . Everything , that is , except the substance of her talk with Michael .   She did n't love Michael ; but he had defended her when she needed defense , and he had promised to do so again . " Beasley thinks I murdered Henry , " she said . " You thought so , then . " John said , his voice suddenly rough , " I did n't believe it . Not in my heart , in spite of the evidence . And I wish now I 'd cut olf my hands before I made those notes that Beasley is using now . " They passed the bus stop and turned off the highway before he said , " I asked Bayne about the Cara Nome Company . He knew nothing of it . I 'll question Hollis . And Thalia . " " Thalia ! " " Why , naturally . She knew , I imagine , more of her father 's affairs than she admitted . She 's nobody 's fool , you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She 's smart , and she 's 4 Henry 's daughter , do n't forget that . " " But Thalia ! It 's impossible ; a woman . .. " " Not at all . Some of the most successful business frauds have been conceived and carried out by women . And do n't forget , or perhaps I did n't tell you  --  the date of the letter throwing up the contract was after Henry 's death . Eleven days afterward . And that , " he said , " is another possible lead that came to nothing . The envelope and thus the postmark was destroyed long ago . Everyone whom we know to be connected with the case was here at the time . Whether the letter was sent to some obligingfriend in New York to be mailed  --  or mailed right here in Ponte Verde , there was no risk , for at that time there was no suggestion of this Cara Nome business . Victoria , what did Clistie know ? What did she do that night ? Who was the maid that Agnew and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came in ? You say you talked to him from the balcony just before he came into the house . That must have been about the time he saw the maid . What time was it then ? " At best it was only a guess . Twelve , she thought  --  perhaps a little after . It was before she heard the car in which Thalia and Hollis had returned from Ponte Verde . " I keep thinking , why did Clistie go to the pump house ? " she said . " And why was Joan Green murdered ? " " Well , of course , " he said , " as to that , there is a perfectlyP197simple explanation for both . Joan Green was murdered because she was wearing Clistie 's dress , and Clistie went to the pump house because she was trying to hide . " The gates loomed darkly ahead of them . He turned and passed Judson 's little house , dark too . It made her think of Judson and the spade , and she told him as they went along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Yes . " They turned again along the dark tunnel of liveoaks . A light burned at the entrance of the house . He stopped the car in the circle before the lighted doorway , got out and went around the car to open the door for Victoria . He put out his hands to help her . And then drew her down close into his arms and said , holding her , his mouth against her hair , " Vicky . Oh , my little Vicky . I love you so much . " P198HE KISSED her hair . And , turning in his arms with the soft , dark night enclosing them both , her face and her mouth met his . He said , against her lips , " I 've known it for a long time . Even last winter when I . . . Oh , Vicky , " he said , and kissed her . He held her as if he never meant to let her go . How long had she loved him like that ? Had she loved him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? But it did n't matter , not in the faintest , smallest degree ; she knew , now . He said , " I 'm going to get you out of this horror , Vicky . I ) o you understand ? I could have killed Beasley tonight when I came and found you there so  --  so little and white and .. . Someone not far from them laughed . Very softly but clearly , so the sound carried in the quiet darkness . Victoria turned quickly . She would have moved apart from him , but John held her and said , over her head , " Oh , Miss Frame ? I did n't know you were there . " Then Victoria saw Thalia . She was standing in the rim of shadow beyond the little area of light from the door . Her slender figure was outlined palely in white against the shrubberybehind her . She came toward them , her face emerging slowly from the shadows , disclosing itself in beauty.  | " I thought you did n't see me . I did n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've arrested Michael ? " " I did n't arrest him , " said John . " He was arrested . It does n't matter whether you or Beasley did it . The fact remains he 's evidently to be charged with murder . " She came closer . So close that Victoria could see a sharper outline of her face , and all at once it was n't beautiful at all . " But I think I 'm going to have something to say about that . At last , " said Thalia . There was a small pause . Then John said , " So you knew . " " Yes , I knew , " said Thalia , watching him . " I see . Then why did n't you tell before now ? I rather expectedit . " Thalia said to Victoria , " He 's talking about his quarrel with my father . You see , my dear , this man you seem so devoted to , in spite of your engagement to Michael , knew my father . And quarreled with him and threatened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colonel Galant all about it . So you see , Michael will have me , my dear , to thank for his freedom . How do you like that ? " John said quickly , " Victoria , this really is unimportant and in the past . " " But it 's true , " cried Thalia , smiling . " You ca n't deny it . It probably does not reflect very creditably upon my father ; but at the same time , my father remembered it so well that he did n't want to come here last winter . Because  --  are you listening , Victoria ?  --  because John Campbell lived at Ponte Verde and my father was afraid of him . He told me so and he told me the reason why . " She whirled around to John . " I did n't tell last winter . I could see you were afraid I would . You wondered  --  then you decided I did n't know of it and you were safe . But I ( lid know . I only kept my own counsel for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own . But now that reason does n't exist . And Michael "  --  she said , very softly , as gently as a warm little breeze in the tree-tops  --  " Michael will have me to thank . " " So it was you who cut the wedding dress to pieces , " said John , matter-of-factly . P200Thalia caught her breath in a sharp sound that itself was like the tearing of silk . " Victoria , you saw . . . " " You must have clone it before you went to Ponte Verde with Hollis , " said John . " But you forgot the scissors . So , later , you crept into her room again , after you returned from Ponte Verde . She was on the balcony . . . . " Thalia cried again , " You saw me ! " Her hands ( strong , little hands with the thumbs Agnew had said were criminal thumbs ) darted out toward Victoria , and John caught her wrists and held them quietly for a moment , looking down into her small , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows , " he said . " Nobody but Victoria and I. " " I suppose that 's a bribe , " flashed Thalia . " No , " he said , and turned to Victoria . His face was in the shadow , the light behind him silhouetted his tall figure . " It 's true , what Thalia says . I did quarrel with her father a long time ago . I did threaten him . But I did n't kill him . Believe me , Victoria  --  andtry to trust me . Will you ? " Thalia gave a queer kind of whispering laugh . " I do trust you , " said Victoria . He put both hands around her face and kissed her mouth . And said low , " Good night , my darling . " She went with Thalia inside the house . The sound of his car gradually died away . Thalia looked indecisively at the door and then , with an odd half-glance at Victoria , she locked and double-locked it . " There 's a trooper on the terrace , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But still ... " They walked upstairs in silence . At the top of the stairs , Thalia hesitated , and then said in a whisper , " You had everything , do you see , Victoria ? I knew , at least I guessed  --  oh , for a long time , really , I knew that my father was stealing . There were things  --  but I did n't care . Not really . Then when he died and it all came out , I lost  --  well , everything . However , he got money , he had it . After his death , I had nothing except what I you gave me . And I lost Michael too . To you . You had everything , and still you took what I had left . And that night , Mondaynight  --  it was like a wedding dinner . It was more than 1P201could bear . I. thought how you 'd look in white satin at the wedding . So I . . . " Thalia . . . " Victoria put her hand upon Thalia 's . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the evidence they have against Michael ? I only know that they 've arrested him . He telephoned ; they let him do that . He talked to me ; but he did n't tell me why ; they would n't give him time . Of course I know about his car , the night Colonel Galant was shot . Is that all ? " She listened , her small face concentrated and thoughtful while Victoria told her of the tire marks . And then briefly of the motive Beasley attributed to him . Thalia said , still whispering , " I suppose Beasley thinks you were both in the scheme  --  you and Michael . Where are you going ? " Victoria , turning to go downstairs again , said over the banister , " To telephone to the lawyer in New York . " " I 've already done that . He 'll come tomorrow  --  as soon as he can get away . " She smiled a little . " You see , I did that for Michael , too . It 's true , you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My father  --  well , it 's true . I did n't tell anyone last winter . I was satisfied to  --  let the investigation run its course . " The shadow of a smile was on her lovely mouth again . Victoriasaid , " Because I was the principal suspect . Is that why ? " " Listen , Victoria , I knew from the first that you were going to take Michael away from me . If John Campbell suspected you of murder , then why should I tell anything that would  --  well , divert suspicion to him ? Why should I go out of my way to be a friend to you ? I thought , Let him go ahead and arrest you ; let him charge you with murder . It "  --  a little cold look crossed Thalia 's lovely face  --  " it would n't have come to  --  well , to a conviction . You 're far too pretty for one thing . And I did n't think John Campbell would go that far . Not , " said Thalia suddenly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So now you have the truth ... . " Thalia , " said Victoria wearily , " surely you know now that Michael and I are not going to be married . " She turned and walked down the hall . When she reached her own door , Thalia came running softly after her . " Victoria , " she whispered , and caught at her arm , " that does n't make any difference , you know . I 'm going to tell them that John Campbell threatened to kill my father . And that he  --  Victoria , are n't you listening ? " She went into her room , leaving Thalia standing there . She closed the door . After she 'd locked it as she 'd done  --  half incredulously  --  the night before she heard Thalia 's light footsteps tiptoeing down the hall . John had said  --  oh , a long time ago , beside the blue and gray lake at Camp Blakoe  --  that Henry Frame was the kind of man someone might want to murder . As if he knew . Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It began to rain about two  --  a steady , rhythmic rain that sounded like stealthy , even footsteps on the terrace below . Walking up and down , never quite loud , never quite definite , always furtive and pursuing , haunting the house and all within it . But it was only rain ; twice , at least , she went to listen to that steady , furtive patter on the terrace , to make sure that it was only the rain . It rained all night . It was still raining in the morning  --  a gray , chilly morning with the rain like thin impenetrable shrouds over everything , so the gray river and the gray Spanish moss all blended with it . Bessie stayed in her room . Hollis disappeared , and no one knew where he 'd gone . Thalia met Victoria coolly and announced that she intended to take a car to Pine Beach to meet the lawyer who would telegraph the time of his arrival at the airport . She asked Victoria politely which car she could use and said she would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself . She had n't talked to Beasley yet , she said , or to Colonel Galant ; she preferred seeing Michael 's lawyer first . But she had already told Agnew of it . He sought out Victoriato tell her that and that he was going to see Beasley . He was excited , and white and in a hurry . " It makes Campbell a suspect , " he said . " If what she says is true . And I think it is . " " Yes , it 's true . He admitted it last night . "   sake . After Wednesday . . . " Clistie had said on that last day of her life . ) " I 'd better get along . " They were in the hall . Agnew began to struggle into a raincoat he had over his arm . " Sorry , Vicky , I 'm in a hurry . " Tugging at his raincoat , he dashed out into the rain , hurrying along the driveway toward Judson 's cottage and the garage . Judson . She 'd better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ message about the spade and then she would take the station wagon to Ponte Verde and make them let her see Michael . No one saw her leave the house . Rain hung around the shrubs and trees like a heavy mist . But Judson was not in his house and he was not in the greenhouse . The colored boy , Albert , was painting porch chairs in the shed back of the garage and had not seen him . " But Mist ' Judson , he kind of mad , " said Albert , painting industriously . " Fin ' a brown patch of grass roun ' that of millstone in the garden and blame me . Say I dig up the turf . I did n't touch no turf . He kind of mad . Ain ' seen him , though . Want something , Miss Vicky ? " She went inside the garage and backed out the station wagon . Then , leaving it in the driveway , got out again . " I did n't dig up no turf , " Albert had said . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , the simple association of the words dig and spade that led her through the wet and dripping garden , along the hedge and out onto the little promontory above the river with the sundial , and the old millstone set into the turf . There she and Michael had stood that quiet night , with the white moonlight and the sharp black shadows all around them . No one was there now . But there was a patch  --  more than a patch of brown turf . Even under the reviving rain a rim of grass looked brown and dead . As if it had been lifted away from the millstone it encircled . She knelt down , the drone of the rain everywhere in her ears . The millstone was sunken deep into the soil and gradually shadowy , misty vistas . She wondered if by any chance Judson could have gone that way . She stopped . She went into the pine woods only a little way . And then she saw Hollis , in a raincoat , hurrying along the path toward her . His eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face had no color at all , and he was breathing rather quickly . " Vicky ! " he said . " You  --  surprised me ! I thought I was alone . " " I was looking for Judson . " " Oh . Well , he 's not around . I 've just been for a  --  a walk . I could n't sit there in the house and  --  and wait . Wait to be arrested ; wait to be charged with murder . They 're making a case against me , you know , Vicky . They 've got to charge somebody with murder . They 've arrested Michael . They 'll arrest me too . But it wo n't stop the murders . It wo n't stop anything .. . His voice was rising higher and thinner ; the pupils in his eyes were hard , shiny black circles . She put her hand on his arm . " Hollis , I 've been thinking about Clistie , the night she was murdered . " Hollis had seen her then ; Agnew had said he had talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought . " Well , what about Clistie ? I did n't kill her , if that 's what you want to know . " " Hollis  --  it 's that stone . That millstone in the garden , remember ? Near the sundial . " " Well ? " " It 's got the words Cara Nome carved on it . " " Has it ? " " Do you  --  know anything about it ? " " About that ? " he laughed shortly . " So Clistie asked you too ? " " Asked me what , Hollis ? " She must be very patient with him , she thought . His face was drawn , and he looked as if he had n't slept for days . " Asked you about a Cara Nome Company . She asked me , you know . Seemed to have got it into her head that I was trying to defraud somebody and that Henry knew it and I  --  well , pushed - Henry into the river . But I did n't . " He stopped and took hold of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't . You believe me , do n't you ? I 'm a coward  --  maybe . I hated Henry , yes . He  --  he had been after me about this Cara Nome Corn-P207pany too , the day before he died , but I did n't , I tell you , I did n't ... " " Hollis , wait . I do n't understand what you 're saying . Please tell me again . " He was breathing heavily , like Bessie when she was excited . " What did Henry ask you ? What did Clistie ask you ? " " Just what I 've told you , " he said . " Henry got hold of me the afternoon  --  the very afternoon before he died . He had some kind of letter about a Cara Nome Construction Company . And Clistie too ; she 'd got the letter from his room , the morning after he was killed . She said she went into his room before the coroner got there ; to straighten it up , she said . You know Clistie ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter . She would n't show it to me . But she as good as told me that all this time she 'd been thinking that I killed Henry , and she kept the letter and would n't tell the police because she was sure they 'd let you off and she was just as sure they 'd convict me . She never liked me . I knew that ; but we  --  the Steanes  --  wee e her life . That 's what she said . " His voice was not high and nervous now ; it was very quick and low , as if the trees , as if the rain , as if the long gray wisps of Spanish moss touching his shoulder might hear . He said , " You believe me , do n't you , Vicky ? That 's right . I 've got to have somebody believe me . Every time the telephone rings , every time a car drives up to the door , I think they 're coming after me . Me  --  Vicky . . . " " They are n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as soothinglyas she could . " Hollis , tell me again . Slowly , so I  --  so I can understand . " He wrenched his arm away from her and rubbed his eyes with wet , nervous fingers . " I ca n't sleep . " She 'd better get him to talk to John , she thought swiftly . She said , " Hollis , tell all this to John Campbell , will you ? He 'll ... " " Tell him ! No  --  not anybody . " He stopped suddenly and said in a more normal voice , " That Cara Nome , though , on the millstone  --  I do know about that . I remember seeing it when I was a kid , before the grass grew over it . It was your father 's idea . He and your mother were trying to find a name for the house . Finally , one of them  --  they 'd just been in Italy  --  suggestedCara Nome . They were sentimental , you know , in those days . Your father had brought that millstone from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on it . But they never named the place . And your mother died . . . I expect mother remembers , or even Colonel Galant  --  but I do n't know anything else about it . I  --  I 'll walk this off , Victoria . We 'll talk later . Just now  --  being here in the woods and thinking about Clistie and Joan . . . That 's all , Vicky , " he said suddenly , and jerked his arm away . She saw him disappear beyond the tall , yew hedge . She 'd better go straight to Michael , she decided , staring into the gray vistas of the pine woods . Cara Nome , and a letter ; and Clistie , and Cara Nome again , but this time , with a different  --  such a different significance . Yes , she 'd go to Ponte Verde . She 'd not look for Judson now . She glanced clown the path in the direction Hollis had come from , hurrying from the gray wraiths of Spanish moss and rain , and saw the spade . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removed from the path , actually toward the river . When she reached it , however , it was only a spade . Nothing unusual about it , nothing significant . Except that , against the tree , too , between it and the spade , as if it had been tossed there hurriedly , was a small wet bundle  --  gray , sodden , soiled , with pieces of leaves and grass clinging to it . It was so much the color of its background that it was visible only because Victorialooked closely . It was a gray-silk dress . She did not entirely unroll the sad , wet little bundle ; she was sure it was Joan Green 's dress . She straightened up slowly . The path curved toward the river just there , and , to reach the spade , she had had to go still nearer the low bank . Standing there , holding the wet , crumpled silk , trying to think , she looked down at the water  --  almost at her feet , gurgling a little around the willows . A log floated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't a log ; it was a brown leather jacket , sodden and muddy . It was Judson  --  his arm caught around the willowsp209much as Henry 's had been , and the gray leaves trailed in the muddy little eddies over his face . The river was swollen with the rain , the brown thing caught there in the willows moved a little with the muddy current . She moved backward . The pine woods had known it ; they were shocked and still and gray along those shadowy , wraithlikearches . The rain knew it and made a dreary kind of dirge upon the leaves above her head . She was running along the path , back toward the house . But suddenly she realized that Hollis was between her and the house . She skirted the garden , ducking behind the wet hedge . She reached the station wagon in the drive . Her hand was so steady on the ignition , on the starter , on the wheel that it was as if it acted independently of her own will . Yet she did n't really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's small , dark little cottage ; she passed the gates ; she turned into the highway and passed the bus stop where Joan Green came to keep that disastrous appointment . She had almost reached Ponte Verde when it seemed to her that a car was following her . P210THE rain was heavy ; she had turned on lights . The windshield wiper made quick swipes across her vision that cleared it for fractional instants at a time . The car behind her had turned on its lights , too . She could see them in the mirror above the windshield  --  glimmeringdistantly through the sheets of rain behind her , pale in the gray daylight , like two bright eyes following her . Just outside Ponte Verde there was a turn which would take her to the main road going toward Camp Blakoe . Michael was at Ponte Verde ; John was at Camp Blakoe . There was no time to consider . She glanced up into the mirror , the station wgon swaying along the slippery road ; it seemed to her the following lights were closer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would go on straight into Ponte Verde . She swung around the corner , toward the direct road to Camp Blakoe . It was a narrow road , just there , lined with liveoaks , streamingwith rain ; a mile further on it joined the highway that went to Camp Blakoe . She peered into the mirror trying to see the crossroads behind her that she had just passed , trying to see whether the car she had thought was following her turned orP211went straight into town . She did n't see Michael 's long gray car swooping out of the rain directly in front of her until it was almost upon her ; Michael was driving . Boll- of them tried to stop and glided past each other . Then she t cunt . to a full stop and rolled down the window . The long gray coupe was backingup , toward her . It stopped and Michael leaned out . " Michae i ! " " What 's wrong ? Where are you going ? What 's happened ? " " Michael , it 's Judson . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . Oh , Michael , Hollis did it ! There was the spade and Joan Green 's dress ; I 've got it here . I was going to Camp Blakoe to tell them there . I could n't go in the house . Oh , Michael . . . " " I 'll go with you . He must be crazy . " A truck had come up behind him and was honking loudly . Rain streamed between them , cascading down the sides of the cars and along the windshields . He shouted above the rain and the honking of the truck , " I 've got to pull up . Look  --  I ' 11 follow you . Go ahead . " She started out slowly , keeping at a slow speed until she could see , in the mirror , that Michael 's car had turned and was coming toward her . Then her foot went down on the gas throttle again . Michael must have been released from arrest ; probably he was starting home , taking that road out of town when she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was following her and looked into the mirror . Michael had turned on dim lights too and they were close behind her , but in the rain she could see no one behind Michael 's car . Probablythe other car had gone on , as she thought it might , into Ponte Verde . Michael was right , of course ; Hollis really was crazy ; it would be his defense ; she thought of his face , drawn and white , his eyes , his jerky , almost incoherent words  --  everything he had said and done in the brief , dreadful encounter . She saw now that it had been dangerous . He had been running then from murder . Michael 's car drove up alongside , and he hailed her , through the rain , rolling down the window . " There 's a convoy on the main road , " he shouted . " Better take the other one  --  I 'll show you .. He waved and drove on ahead through the outskirts of the little rain-drenched town , and out along a country road , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trucks toward camp . It was difficult driving ; the ditches were already almost road level with muddy water . Michael 's car plunged on ahead of her , swerving , righting itself ; her windshield wiper stuck and after several futile attempts to free it she gave up . The streamingrain obscured her vision . Michael stopped to wait several times and then drew his car up to the edge of the road , jumped out of it , a raincoat over his head and ran to the station wagon . " I 'll drive , " he said . " You 'll go in the ditch . Get over . What 's the matter with your windshield wiper ? " He too worked with it and gave it up and leaned forward to peer through the blinding rain . " Tell me about it , " he said . " What makes you think it 's Hollis ? " She told him , lifting her voice above the roar of the rain and the engine , the rattle of the old station wagon . She told him of meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clistie the night Clistie was murdered and the reason for it ; she told him of the spade and of Cara Nome and what , so far , they knew of it ; she told him of Hollis ' eyes and what he had said and how he had left her there in the pine woods  --  to go along in the direction from which he 'd come and find what she had found . She showed him , still rolled up in a wet , soiled little bungle , the gray silk dress that Joan Green must have worn . He glanced at it , and then back at the slippery , winding road , the deep muddy ruts and the blinding rain ahead . " Hollis did n't actually say he 'd murdered Judson , did he ? " " No , but he  --  Michael , do n't you understand ?  --  I caw him running from the woods ! I saw his face ... . " I know . But all the same  --  you see , John Campbell one time threatened to kill Henry Frame . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . " Did she tell him she knew ? Did Campbell admit it ? " " Yes . Thalia said she 'd known all along . She did n't tell be-P213cause  --  well , that is n't important . But there 's no evidence r against him , Michael . " He leaned forward over the wheel , watching the road " There 's a motive . That 's been the main question -- nut t yr Campbell himself has emphasized it constantly . Too constantly , he must have felt pretty safe when Thalia did n't tell . He mum have thought she did n't know . It would explain why he ttir  --  1 to get you charged with murder ; if you , or anybody else wail convicted , it would clear him . And why he dropped the caw with the suicide verdict . He was in an ideal position . ' The State 's Attorney , arrayed on the right side of the law , no question of his own implication in a murder it was his duty to in vestigate . " " Why would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know , unless he knew that Clistie was on his trail . Perhaps he was planning a way out for himself . The earnest , conscientious former State 's Attorney doing his duty , in spite of everything . Did he know I was coming that night ? " " No , " she said and then remembered . " Yes .... " " Perhaps I was to be a way out , too ! Henry was murdered only a couple of days or so after I got here . If a murder was committed on the very night I arrived again , it might provide another valuable suspect . " " But the Cara Nome business , Michael ? He could have known nothing of that . " Do you know what his quarrel was with Henry ? When it was ? Anything about it ? " He swerved around a turn , and righted the car . " There was something that brought them together . Perhaps that was it . Vicky , " he was looking indecisively through the rain at the road and sparse black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missed the turn , " he said . " Can you see the camp ? " The windshield was clouded with faint gray steam ; he wiped a space with his hand ; she peered through the window at her side . She could see nothing but wet , dreary stretches of halfclearedpine growth  --  sandy , wet , dotted with outcroppings of thick palmetto growth . There was no glimpse of any of the low buildings of the wide-flung camp.  | " But this must be the general direction . Oh , yes , " he said , " there 's the lake off at the left . The road must follow it . We 've missed the new road , but this will be all right . " The station wagon plunged rattling and careening ahead . The road had imperceptibly narrowed still further , had becomeonly a rut through the desolate , deserted growth of pines and palmettos . At any rate , no car would follow them there . " Agnew came and told Beasley this morning how my tire marks got on the new road the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hold me . Beasley questioned me a long time last night and let me out this morning . Vicky , what do you suppose Clistie did with the letter ? According to Hollis , she must still have had it Monday night . I wonder if she got hold of this Green girl after she talked to Hollis . Yes , that must be it . She knew the girl was in the office at camp and thought she might be able to find out who was back of the Cara Nome affair  --  that leads to Campbell again . Anyway , Clistie would n't ask Colonel Galant because he would do things too thoroughly . He 'd not stop , no matter who was back of it , and Clistie must have been still worried for fear it was Hollis . And Joan Green liked him and would n't give him away . So Clistie  --  yes , she must have got the girl out to the house ; met her at the gate , maybe ; walked with her along that strip back of the yew hedge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was there on the porch at the time and did n't see them . I thought once I heard somebody talking somewhere , it was distant and muffled . I did n't pay any attention to it . .. . " Yes , I heard that too . I was on the balcony . " " I know . I heard you . Well , anyway , the murderer must have got onto what was going on . There 's plenty of places to hide in a place like that . He must have caught a glimpse of the girl in Clistie 's dress ; if Joan hid from him , say , in the pine woods and it was dark there and if she was then in Clistie 's dress and he 'd seen her only distantly , crossing that moonlighted strip of grass , perhaps , he might have followed and slipped up behind her and strangled her , quick  --  hard  --  thinking it was Clistie . Yes , that 's it ... . It conjured up a horrible picture against the rain ahead.  | " And , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he saw her face and realized his mistake , he  --  he took off your belt and got the girl in the river and came hack to murder Clistie . And then Clistie , when you told her about the scream , must have thought of the girl . . . . " " Yes , " cried Victoria , remembering Clistic 's pale , frightened face . " It 's why she would n't call anybody to help her . It 's why she would n't let me or Agnew go with her . She did n't want anyoneto know . " " And then  --  well , then she must have gone down to the garden , maybe to the pine woods and looked for the girl . That would explain the mark of the slipper heel . It must have been made by Clistie . She  --  what would she do next ? I suppose she would hide . " He glanced at the gray bundle . " That 's it , of course . She had to hide evidence of the girl 's having been there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Then she must have thought it was Hollis . She would n't have protected anybody else . " " Unless  --  perhaps she saw the murderer . Perhaps she was terrified , trying to escape him . Perhaps she wanted to keep the dress  --  and the letter , Vicky , the letter !  --  from falling into his hands . The dress looks as if it had been buried . She had a spade that afternoon . She was in the garden when I got there , late , and I believe she came from the direction of the millstone . That 's it ; she must have left the spade there and remembered and buried the dress there , too . And left the spade again where , later , Judson found it  --  and the dress and the letter ! I suppose she 'd eluded Campbell  --  the murderer anyway  --  but then he knew he had to get her . He caught a glimpse of her , or she saw him ; she ran along the yew hedge , perhaps , out of sight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen her and knew she had seen him ! And Cara Nome , whatever it is , was a danger signal from the first ! " ( " Poison to somebody . . . " John had said that , too . But he could n't have murdered . ) " That letter  --  yes , Vicky , it must be there . Shake out the dress . Look ... " Her fingers shrank from the clammy silk . She unrolled
