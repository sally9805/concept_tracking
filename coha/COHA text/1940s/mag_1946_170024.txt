In all Christendom this week the Easter message was heard again : <P> In the end of the sabbath , as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week , came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre . <P> And , behold , there was a great earthquake : for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven , and came and rolled back the stone from the door , and sat upon it . His countenance was like lightning , and his raiment white as snow . And for fear of him the keepers did shake , and became as dead men . <P> And the angel answered and said unto the women , Fear not ye : for I know that ye seek Jesus , which was crucified . He is not here : for he is risen , as he said . Come , see the place where the Lord lay . And go quickly , and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead ; and behold , he goeth before you into Galilee . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sepulchre with fear and great joy ; and did run to bring his disciples word . <P> And as they went to tell his disciples , behold , Jesus met them , saying , AH hail . And they came and held him by the feet , and worshiped him . Then said Jesus unto them , Be not afraid : go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee , and there shall they see me . . . . <P> And Jesus came and spake unto them , saying , All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth . Go ye therefore , and teach all nations , baptizing them in the name of the Father , and of the Son , and of the Holy Ghost : teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you : and lo , I am with you alway , even unto the end of the world .
