In Birmingham , Ala. , where the city 's three daily newspapers have been closed for three weeks by a printers ' strike , people began to worry in earnest . One by one the striking printers were taking jobs elsewhere ; by week 's end 45 of them had drawn traveler 's cards from the union and left town . <P> Meanwhile the radio , helped out by the pooled reporters of the morning Age-Herald , the evening News and Post , did its best to keep people informed . Station WAPI set up an I.N.S. news ticker in a window of Blach 's department store , divided two windows into sections marked Local News , State News , National News , War News , Markets , Sports , Weather , Demobilization , etc . The crowds that gathered to read the latest stories as they were pasted up , all but blocked traffic past the store .
