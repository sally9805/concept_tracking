txt A UNITED STATES ARMY AIR BASE in Central China , Dec. 9 ( Delayed ) ? Although China lies at the dim end of our long lines of communication , Brig . Gen. Claire L. Chennault , commander of our China Air Task Force , retains his enthusiasm and confidence . Free China may be pinched and poor behind the Japanese blockade , but I General Chennault is rich in ideas and energy . He and his staff inhabit a headquarters building that vividly symbolizes our investment in the Chinese theatre of war . It is part of the Chinese compound , and its yellowish % loft buildings are of piestered mud construction with a mudtile root . Officers and enlisted men sit at unpainted pine desks , wrapped in field jackets or sheep-lined coats , while a Chinese orderly in a bulgy padded uniform keeps making the round of stoves with fresh fuel . Clogged with visitors who stand because there is no place to sit . this headquarters gives an impromptu impression of making the most of the least without grumbling . In a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visitors the incomparable luxury of a striped porch chair that looks more hospitable than it is . But the general , who has had five and one-half years ' experience in fighting the Japanese with next to nothing , radiates hospitality and is the graveyard of all doubts about the war in China . As an airman who organized and led the fighting American Volunteer Group before he took over his present command , he believes he is fighting the weakest arm of the Japanese war machine and that // CHENNAULT IS SURE CHINA CAN WIN WAR // destroying Japanese aviation is the first step toward defeating Japan . By frugally husbanding his resources and planning every action with exactitude , he has led an air force that has made an astonishing record , destroying ten or more Japanese planes for every one lost , by an American . It has established air superiority wherever it has been able to operate . Although General Chennault does not indulge personally ' in mathematical rationalization , he has no objection to a visitor 's estimate that , if the same ratio of success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could destroy the effective Japanese air force . In his opinion , the Japanese air force is deteriorating . He does not think it now includes many pilots of more than four to six months ' experience , and , while new Japanese planes have excellent performance , the quality of the engines is deteriorating noticeably . He estimates Japan 's ability to to replace combat planes at not more than 250 a month , " which is a high estimate , " he says . To hisi way of thinking , these facts bear directly on the job of defeating Japan . " As every one knows , " he said in. an interview yesterday afternoon , " no army or navy can operate without an air force . China is the logical place for the Japanese air force because the Japanese must have some place from which to get at and protect the China posts they have occupied . Look at the map for yourself and you will see what I mean . " By now General Chennault is an old China hand . He not only likes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miracle man , but believes in them as soldiers . " So far , " he points out , " they are the only soldiers who have defeated the Japanese in open battle , man for man . They have done it many times . " Since one thing they do not lack is manpower , our function is to supply them with equipment so they can fight . " General Chennault points out that the Chinese fought the Japanese alone for four and one-half years , while Americans were still selling war materials to the Japanese . He has also found the Chinese wonderfully cooperative , from the common soldier to the commanding officer , and generous with whatever material they have had . As for the assumption that the Americans came to the rescue of China , General Chennault reports the Japanese had been preparing for twenty years - to attack us . " Do you suppose that the attack on Pearl Harbor was on the spur of the moment ? " he inquired . " Do you suppose the attack on the Philippines was extemporaneous ? " It took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those attacks with so much exact knowledge of our airdromes , equipment , installations and forces . We are in this war because the Japanese attacked us , as they had been planning to do deliberately for many years . " Apart from the war , General Chennault is interested in the future of China as a market for American goods and a source of raw products . We are the only nation , he says , that is not at this moment studying China and paving the way for post-war trade . According to General Chennault , Wendell L. Willkie got a better grasp on China In a few days than . most Americans do in months and understood the fact that after the war millions of Chinese ; who have been seeing America 's products for the first time will want to , use them and that China will be able to exchange for therh silk , tungsten , certain grades of tea , tin , hog bristles and many other materials we need or can use . Since the Chinese have high regard - for Americans generally , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' on a large scale for a huge market that will keep our factories working . In fact , General Chennault is a stimulating man to listen to on one 's first day in China and much warmer of heart than the feeble little charcoal stoves in his draughty headquarters .
