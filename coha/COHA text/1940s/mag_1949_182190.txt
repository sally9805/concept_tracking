If there are 400 things that London 's progressive Tate Gallery ca n't abide , they are the pictures and sculptures that for the past 52 years have been drifting in from the bequest of wealthy Victorian Sculptor Sir Francis Chantrey . In that time , the unhappy custodians of the Tate have willy-nilly acquired tons and acres of lowing kine , rearing horses , languorous ladies , idyllic landscapes and storm-beset ships-of-the-line . <P> Except for about 30 pieces ( including an Epstein bust and a sprinkling of Pre-Raphaelites ) , the Tate has resolutely packed them off to the cellar . That , says the gallery 's pastel-shirted Director John Rothenstein , is where they belong . <P> Probably nothing would have given greater shock to well-intentioned Donor Chantrey . He had left the bulk ( 105,000 ) of his estate for " the purchase of works of fine art of the highest merit . . . executed within the shores of Great Britain . " Chantrey 's will specified that the president and council of the Royal Academy should be the judges of what to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had picked the Tate as just the place for the collection . <P> This week in London , the Royal Academy , having worked over Tate 's basement trove , put the whole collection on show in its Piccadilly museum . The Academy hopes to prove the error of Scoffer Rothenstein 's ways , to end what it considers a " mischievous and unseemly controversy . " Rothenstein hopes gallerygoers will laugh the collection back to the cellar . In a sense , he will be on show himself . From a group study entitled The Princess Badroulbadour , painted by his father Sir William Rothenstein , the young John of 1908 will gaze , fixed and helpless , at the passing jury .
