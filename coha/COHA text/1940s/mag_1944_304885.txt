BATTLE OF GERMANY ( East ) <P> Out of the westering sun , U.S. Flying Fortresses appeared over Warsaw . They had flown 900 miles from Britain , with an escort of Mustangs most of the way . Now all but a handful of the Mustangs had turned back , but fresh fighter cover was provided by the Red Air Force , flying from the east . In the clear afternoon light the Forts had little difficulty in finding the areas designated for the drops . Then they went on to a base in Russia . <P> The previous week , the Russians themselves had finally started to drop food and ammunition . This week they continued . And from the south came what may well have been the most useful aid : Mediterranean Air Force planes carried loads of German ammunition captured in Italy , to fit German guns captured in Warsaw . <P> Despite destruction , disease , famine and continued German shelling , the outlook for the Warsaw patriots under their pseudonymous commander Bor , now promoted to Major General , was improving . Crossing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ units carved out a modest bridgehead on the west bank , made contact with Bor 's forces . <P> The best indication that Warsaw could soon hope for liberation was news that the enemy had begun to prepare new defensive positions outside the city to the south and west .
