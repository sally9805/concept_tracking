In the White House , the President appeared to be changing pace as his problems grew more pressing . He cut down his usually long list of callers through the front door , but there was a noticeable pickup in traffic through the White House side doors , where his close advisers enter . The President gave over three full afternoons to talks with Cabinet members and other officials . <P> Crisp autumn weather had come to Washington , and Harry Truman caught a cold that frogged his throat at times . It did not cloud his affability or brake his brisk manner of disposing of business across his desk . Newsmen who jampacked his press conference noticed : 1 ) Harry Truman had switched from summerweight double-breasted to a medium-weight flannel double-breasted suit ; 2 ) his work-to-be-done boxes were stacked high ; 3 ) there was another box on his desk , filled with emerald green match folders . The President indicated the folders , remarked that he was not supposed to be looking . Deskside reporters grabbed the hint and the matches . Across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S. Truman . " Gadgeteer Truman grinned as the souvenirs were passed around . Then he gave out what routine news he had . <P> The President packed six days of desk work into four , gave over one to his role in the homecoming of Fleet Admiral Chester William Nimitz . One thing Harry Truman does not like about his job is its fuss and fanfare . But one ceremonial task the President evidently does enjoy is awarding medals to servicemen and shaking their hands . On " Nimitz Day " he presented the Congressional Medal of Honor to eleven marines and three Navy men . He said to them what he always says on such an occasion : " I would rather have this medal than be President . " He shook hands with all but one-Marine Sergeant William George Harrell , hero of a Marines-legendary fight on Iwo Jima ( TIME , July 30 ) . The sergeant has no hands .
