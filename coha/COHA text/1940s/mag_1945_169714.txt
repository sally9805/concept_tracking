In a shell-scarred , balconied Manila ballroom Japan 's General Tomoyuki Yamashita , onetime " Tiger of Malaya " and " Beast of Bataan , " was on trial for his life . He looked incredibly tame and safe , a froglike man in a green uniform who sat shaven-headed , sleepy-eyed , almost motionless at a long table . Occasionally he smiled . In the ordered courtroom uniformed attorneys shuffled papers , entered objections , laboriously introduced exhibits . <P> Through newly repaired windows came faint , peaceful sounds from the wrecked city . But as witnesses talked from the stand , the nerves of many a spectator ached for the sound of a scream . <P> A pretty , 26-year-old Filipino actress , Corazon Noble , began the testimony , with which the prosecution intended to prove that Japanese atrocities were part of Yamashita 's plan . She had taken refuge with her ten-month-old baby in a Red Cross emergency hospital during the Battle for Manila , had been trapped there by four Japanese sailors . One had raised his rifle , fired , wounded her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> " I was stabbed nine times , " she said . " The baby was stabbed three times . When the Japs were gone I walked out the back door and gave her to my brother . I could n't stand it any more . " <P> " What happened to your infant child ? " <P> " She died . " <P> Terror in the Streets . Widows told of drunken Japanese soldiers leading their husbands and sons out to be killed . Witness after witness described bayonetings , shootings , the sight of singing , drunken Japanese throwing grenades , setting fires , defiling bodies . <P> The tales of horror multiplied : <P> On one Manila street a Jap soldier held a 15-year-old girl 's head up by pulling at her hair , hacked at her neck with a sword as she prayed for mercy . <P> Japs put candy and whiskey in the center of the St. Paul 's College dining hall where 800 people were imprisoned . The crowd jammed around the strange offering . Then explosives , fixed in the ceiling , were set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the city , Japanese troops rounded up thousands of Russian , Chinese , Filipino and Spanish women and girls , chose the prettiest , led them off to Manila hotels to be raped . In one week 476 , some no older than twelve , were hustled away . Some were back to testify last week . <P> Order in the Court . As the testimony wore on , formality lent the proceedings the curious improbability of a bad horror play . But twice there were real and savage scenes . A Chinese woman , who had seen her baby bayoneted , stared at Yamashita from the stand , cried : " That Jap is to blame . He 's got to be killed to pay for what he 's done ! " A slim Filipino girl halted her testimony , cried in a low , tense voice : " You still have the face to look at me , Yamashita . If I could only get near you . You ought to be cut to pieces . " <P> Both women were led from the room . The five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. war-crimes trial , were thus setting a precedent ; they proceeded with the utmost caution . Yamashita , who hoped to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court , would be given every legal courtesy-by men who devoutly hoped to see him face a firing squad .
