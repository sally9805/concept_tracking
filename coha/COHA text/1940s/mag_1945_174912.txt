SURPLUS PROPERTY Mouse House <P> Among the hundreds of war plants the Reconstruction Finance Corp . is trying hard to peddle is a strange and relatively inexpensive one : an air-controlled , glass-bricked mouse house at New City , N.Y . Cost : $150,000 . <P> The 9,000-sq. ft . New City plant was built in the earlier days of the war , when laboratory mice for the processing of tropical-disease serum were desperately scarce in the U.S. Government joined forces with industrv-which in this case turned out to be professional mouse breeders Frederic G. Carnochan and C. N. Wentworth Cumming . They already had a plant at New City . With Government aid , production zoomed from some 5,000 to 15,000 mice a week ( price : 25 a mouse ) . Old . blue-blooded European strains , in danger of war extermination , were crated , bedded down on peanut shells , and flown to New City . By mid-1944 , the famine was licked . By 1945 , cutbacks were ordered , although specialized shortages still existed . <P> Last week , despite its excellent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takers ( although present operators hold an option to buy ) . There were reasons : 1 ) the building has certain mouse-imposed quirks of design ; 2 ) mouse odor is much harder to overcome than a mouse shortage .
