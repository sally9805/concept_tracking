txt Letters to The Times MILTON STEINBERG. pg . E8 Letters to The Times Issues in Palestine Homeland Regarded as Only Hope For Jewish Problem The writer of the following letter is Rabbi of the Park Avenue Synagogue in New York . He has taught classical languages at City College and Jewish theology and homiletics at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America . He is author of " The Making of the Modern Jew , " " As a Driven Leaf , " and the recently published " A Partisan Guide to the Jewish Problem . " To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Had Rabbi Morris Lazaron calculated mischief against the wretched Jews of Europe he could sot have wrought greater harm than he effected with his letter on Palestine and Zionism which appeared in your columns Sept. 30 . At a time when it has been confirmed that 6,000,000 Jews have been butchered ; when those who survive are revealed to be in the wildest extremes of need and despair ; when most of them are sustained only by the hope of migration to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its pledged word , refuses these lost souls the fulfillment of their lone hope ; on the very day on which the Earl Harrison report is published , confirming both the desperation of Europe 's Jews and the indispensability of Palestine ? at this anguished juncture in Jewish history Dr. Lazaron arises to voice a counsel of compromise and moderation and to weave finespun , farfetched reservations about Zionism . Effect Called Harmful One would have supposed that a Jew , a rabbi , if he had the strength of heart for any utterance , would have cried out : " Mercy , I beg , on these my brethren ! " Not Rabbi Lazaron . He speaks a few words in approval of Jewish immigration into Palestine , but he is much more concerned to set forth his scruples and reservations , and above all else to urge that its advocates do not press its cause too vigorously . The effect , though unintended , is relentlessly harmful . Dr. Lazaron has muddied the waters , confused the clear issues , which are compassion and the keeping of a pledged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Harrison report , neutralized to a measure the generous intercession of President Truman ; . in sum , prolonged the ordeal of those who have already suffered beyond all endurance . Here are the points over which Rabbi Lazaron is most exercised and , briefly put , the actuality concerning each . Divided Opinion Questioned He is urgently concerned to make it clear that Jews are divided on this issue . And so indeed they are . Is there any decision faced by any sizable body of human beings over which there is. unanimity of opinion ? But what Rabbi Lazaron does not trouble to mention h that despite dissenters the vast bulk of American Jews are solidly pro-Zionist When the rabbis of America were asked to be counted , over 90 per cent revealed themselves as Zionists . What is true of the rabbis is equally true of the laity . Witness the broadly representative American Jewish Conference , at which only four votes out of 500 were cast against the conception of Palestine as a national home and Jewish commonwealth . Witness further the outpouring of 70,000 people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protest meeting . Dr. Lazaron next suggests moderation . Now moderation is normally a virtue . It is. scarcely such when the issue at hand is one of a breach of faith , of human suffering , of injustice . Does Rabbi Lazaron want Jews to be moderate in their concern for the welfare of their fellows ? Does he want them to compromise on the number of Jews to be admitted to Palestine ? Are they to say : " We shall agree to let so many into that haven and consign all beyond to their present hell ? " Arabs Not Cooperative Does he really believe , as he asserts , that if only the Jews would whittle down their claims the Arabs might accede to them ? - Does he not know that the Arabs oppose all Jewish immigration , free and limited alike ; that they have resolutely set themselves against the admission even of a single additional Jew ? Or does he suppose that if Jews would stop talking about a Jewish commonwealth the Arabs would have no objection to Jewish immigration ? Na ? vet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least cooperativeness with those Jews who favor Jewish settlement in Palestine but not a future commonwealth ? Rabbi Lazaron goes on to voice anxiety over the peril in which Zionists are involving Jewish Palestine . He fears lest Zionist pressure for free Jewish immigration may in the end " precipitate violence and bloodshed there " and ultimately destroy the " magnificent achievements which the labor and sacrifice of the last quarter century have established . " One would imagine from Dr. Lazaron 's words that he and the American Council for Judaism , with which he is associated , have been busy as beavers during the past quarter of a century building a Jewish settlement in Palestine ; that all along they have been hampered by the naughty Zionists . Whatever has been accomplished in Palestine has been wrought by Zionism and Zionists . It comes with poor grace for those who all along have been preoccupied with objections and reservations now to put themselves forth as more devoted to Jewish Palestine than its builders . Not that there Is no reason to fear an explosion in Palestine . In all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been alive had Britain adhered to its promise . That bitterness burns in the Jews of Palestine , and the added bitterness of remembering that they fought for the United Nations as the Arabs did not . And now wherever they turn they hear the anguished cries of their parents , brothers , sisters and children clamoring for asylum . They would be less than men if they acquiesced in British iniquity . Yes , there is a terrible danger that British bayonets and machine guns will be called into use against European Jews so desperate that death at the doors of Palestine is better than life where they are ; against Palestinian Jews engaged in the most elementally humane of all enterprises  --  giving asylum to their kin trapped in the fiercest extremity . But the way to avert this peril is not to ask that Europe 's Jews consent to go on rotting into the grave , or that Palestine 's Jews suppress their human instincts . It is , instead , to open the doors of Palestine wide , as Great Britain , and its Labor party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an event will there not be violence in the other direction from the Arabs ? I doubt it . The Arab League , which threatens such violence , be it remembered , is the creature of Britain . A British Government strong enough to impose its dubiously moral will on the restless hundreds of millions of India is scarcely so weak as not to be able to keep order among the million Arabs of Palestine . But even if disorder should emanate from the Arabs , it will be without the least moral basis . It will be violence directed against the saving of lives , and unwarranted violence to boot . What Palestinian Arab has been injured ? Nay , more , when we compare Arab standards of living , of health and of education in Palestine with those in the neighboring Moslem lands , what Arab has not been benefited by the establishment of the Jewish homeland ? Britain 's Responsibility As for the politics of the situation , Arab rights in Palestine , both individual and communal , are altogether secure against any future development . And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its political self , realization . Nor may Britain properly shift its obligations on to other shoulders . Until the United Nations begins to function , responsibility in Palestine is Britain 's , and Britain 's only . No one forced Britain to fake the mandate over Palestine . Rabbi Lazaron is perturbed because Zionism assumes Jews to be a people , whereas he prefers to regard them as purely a religious communion . He is entitled to any conception of Judaism he desires to entertain . But history quarrels with him , and so does experience , both of which reveal the Jews to be not only a creedal body but a historic people as well . Dr. Lazaron is anxious further over the effects of the establishment of an autonomous Jewish polity on the Jews of America . Why should he expect any adverse effects at all ? Did the establishment of the Irish Free State disturb the status of Irish-Americans ? Is it not perfectly clear that the Jews of America have only one political allegiance , and that is to the United States ? Nothing that can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ integrity of that loyalty . Rabbi Lazaron implies that Zionists wish to ghettoize the American Jews and to isolate them from their nonJewish fellows . This is , of course , total nonsense . Witness the measure of " ghettoization " of Louis D. Brandeis and of the Jewish chaplains in the United States Army and Navy , nine out of ten of whom are Zionists or Zionist sympathizers . Last of all , Rabbi Lazaron , I regret to say , is not above appealing for support to a person gravely under the suspicion of being an anti-Semite . In his letter in these columns he quoted with approval from the King-Crane report . Dr. Lazaron is much too wellinformed not to know that no less a personage than the late Ambassador Dodd said concerning Mr. Crane : " Jews are anathema to him and he hopes to see them put in their place . His advice to me was , of course , ' Let Hitler have his way . ' " Central Issues Twofold So much for Rabbi Lazaron 's objections , hesitations , misgivings and reservations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issues , which are twofold . First , whether the Jews who can no longer remain in Europe are to be imprisoned there , festering in their confinement and goaded to wild devices , or whether they are to be allowed to go to Palestine as they desire and where alone they can be transmuted from the social problem which they are now into an asset for all mankind . And deeper and more basic the moral issue , whether after a war fought for the sanctity of covenants and for the ethics of righteousness and compassion , the covenant made with this harried people shall be respected or unilaterally nullified ; whether they who have been so long abused shall be abused still further by their supposed friends , or whether in the other direction Britain shall act in the light of the mercy and the justice to which it is pledged . Between two such sets of alternatives no person clear in mind , forthright in purpose , humane in impulse , can long hesitate . MILTON STEINBERG . New York , Oct. 4 , 1945 . Aid for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the signers of the follotvinq letter are eleven former presidents of the American Economic Association and twelve oilier leading economists of this country . To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIME ' : As a result of the division of war tasks , British exports by 1943 had fallen by more than half in pounds sterling and by 71 per cent in volume . This country , however , maintained its export trade and export connections . The decline of their exports raises difficult problems for the British . It has been estimated in official circles that in order to attain a balance in their international payments , their exports must rise about four times from the low point of 1943 . These exports are the most important source of foreign lcurrencies for the British , which are needed to pay for indispensable imports . Before the war the British paid for about one-third of their imports with the dollars , pesos , etc. , which they earned through sales of services and , most important . interest and profits on past investments abroad . Unfortunately , a major part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's unfunded debt ( blocked balances ) to foreign countries , largely created since 1938 , is now no less than $14,000,000,000 . This debt arose primarily through purchases of materials and foodstuffs for the waging of common war in India and other parts of the British Empire . Long Road to Travel In view of this situation , one can readily understand why the sudden termination of lend-lease rocked the British . Some progress had been made in re-establishing British exports , but they still have a long way to go . Their balance of payments is so precarious that an interest-bearing loan to cover their minimum transitional needs would greatly increase the danger of defaults or of a downward plunge of sterling . In the years 1939 to 1945 the British borrowed or sold assets abroad and obtained lend-lease aid of about $35,000,000,000 . In this manner they were able to get enough dollars to meet the unusual demands for imports and yet stabilize sterling at $4 . But in the future these resources will not be available . The only way out then will be an expansion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one long-run solution for the British : increased efficiency , lower costs and development of export markets  --  that is , an improvement of Britain 's competitive position and , as a condition of large exports , the maintenance of a high level of world trade . These paths to international equilibrium have already been proposed in the official British White Paper on Employment . Other solutions will either reduce the standard of living ( e. g. , reduce imports ) or postpone the day of reckoning ( e. g. , interest-bearing loans ) . But first we must deal with the transition difficulties . In our view , the best way out in the transition is a loan , the exact amount to be determined by Congress and the experts who are studying the problems . The range may well be **28;109;TOOLONG . The British Prime Minister recently estimated that the current deficit on overseas account was running at the annual rate of $4,800,000,000 . The most careful husbanding might pare the dollar deficit down to $2,000,000,000 for the next two years . This loan should be interest free , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it five to ten years from now and over a period of twenty-five to fifty years . We believe that for making an interest-free loan the United States should insist upon whole-hearted fulfillment by the United Kingdom and other members of the British Empire of the economic provisions in the Atlantic Charter and especially Article VII of the Mutual Aid Agreement , and the Bretton Woods Agreements : in particular , reduction of tariff barriers ; adoption of multilateral trading methods ; discouragement of exchange control after a transition period ; restriction of exchange depreciation to conditions set at Bretton Woods . Sharing Responsibility We also contend that the United Kingdom 's governmental creditors on short-term account should be required to share the responsibility for putting the balance of payments of the United Kingdom in equilibrium . This they can do , for example , by granting an interest-free loan . Again , the exact amounts should be determined by taking into account the wartime contributions of these creditor countries . We propose this program because , among other reasons , the alternative is probably a severely restrictive policy on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under which our export trade would suffer greatly . We , therefore , urge all those whz favor freer trade , who are interested in high standards of living and who are determined to do everything possible to exclude economic warfare , to support the program outlined here or a similar one ? an aid which the British need and have richly earned and from which we also will reap benefits in the form of a more stable and prosperous world .
