Americans need not hope for bigger gas rations because the Axis has been wiped out in Africa . Although the Mediterranean is now open , so that oil from Iraq can be carried west , transatlantic shipments from the U.S. east coast will get no smaller . During the entire North African campaign , the big refineries at Haifa and Suez had to operate at top capacity just to supply the British Eighth Army and Mediterranean Fleet . To get more oil for the big Allied armies now in northwest Africa ( and soon perhaps in southern Europe ) tankers would have to bring it from the bigger refineries on the Persian Gulf . But from the refinery at Abadan in Persia ( now perhaps the world 's largest ) , down through the Persian Gulf , around Arabia , up through the Red Sea , through Suez and through the Mediterranean to any point west of Malta is farther than the sea route to the same point from the east coast of the U.S. <P> Geography says no ; so does capacity . The 400,000-odd bbl. daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marshal Wavell 's army in India and Burma , the U.S. air forces in India and China , and part of General MacArthur 's needs . Only what is left over is available for shipment to the Mediterranean . With bigger campaigns in prospect both in Europe and the Orient , the prospect is that the U.S. will ship more oil after Tunis than before . <P> Petroleum Administrator Harold L. Ickes warned the East Coast last week that it would have to cut gasoline consumption still further or face a transportation breakdown . The East is exceeding this month 's gasoline allotment of 356,000 bbl. a day . Emergency demands of farmers and war workers have been met from reserve stocks , with the result that these stocks have declined to 25% of normal , the lowest level on record . To stop a further drain , OPA may soon crack down on T-book holders ( commercial trucks and busses ) , leaving A , B and C rations unchanged .                    @
