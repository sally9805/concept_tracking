In the Colonels ' Revolution that overturned the corrupt , dictatorial regime of President Ramn Castillo , General Arturo Rawson had been one of the few devotees of democracy . For three days , five years ago , he had been President of Argentina . Rawson had passed quickly into history , a black-suited figure destined to spend his days amid the Jockey Club 's splendors , while one of the obscure figures of the revolution , a man named Juan Domingo Pern , made the country over . <P> Last week , on the fifth anniversary of the Colonels ' Revolution , General Rawson wrote : " The objectives were very simple ; first , to restore administrative morality ; second , to re-establish the country in the community of American nations ; and third , to return the country to political normality . " From Buenos Aires , TIME Correspondent Bill Johnson cabled his estimate of what the revolution has accomplished : <P> The New Order . " In some respects Argentina has changed little since the revolution . The same charges of graft and corruption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directed by the opposition toward the Pern administration . Electoral processes , while superficially normal , still give little chance to any but the party in power . But the hitherto neglected working classes have been forged into a political weapon that relieves the President of his sole reliance on the army as a means of staying in office . Higher wages have been showered on them ( up 150% since 1943 ) ; massed descamisados are drafted for " spontaneous " demonstrations , and have gained a sense of participation in government they never had before . If they have lost what independence they had , it does n't seem to bother them . Most serious hitch ahead : whether Pern can hold them despite zooming living costs . <P> " For Castillo 's almost continuous state of siege Argentines have exchanged a pseudo-legal and semi-respectable repression that is , if anything , more severe . University students and professors with political ideas are no longer pushed around by police ; all troublesome ones have been removed , and a new law permits political opinion and activity-so long as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against Castillo 's decrees have with but one exception been silenced by Pern 's subsidies and newsprint restrictions ; and even great La Prensa is visibly weakening . Recently the government decreed that either Argentines or foreigners may be jailed for such general crimes as ' promoting discords or antagonisms dangerous to the public tranquillity . ' <P> " A law which was secretly submitted to Congress at the start of the current session is even stronger : it permits the Executive to declare a state of emergency and to draft every individual and every enterprise into service and make them subject to military law . In a nation that has n't fought a war for 70 years , this law can only be interpreted as a device for maintaining civil order . "
