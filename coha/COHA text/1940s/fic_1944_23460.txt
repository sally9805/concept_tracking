THE STAGECOACH A Stay GRIFFITH BEEMS AFT ERWARDS my sister and I were sorry , but there is this about Grand- father : if you get something on him you have to use it . Grandfather is seventy-three and set in his ways , and when my sister and I discovered the discrepancies in his Plummer story we could n't keep our mouths shut . We went over together for dinner and Betty asked him about Plummer Tavern . It is easy to start him : Grandfather was slicing green onions and mixing them with his potatoes , but he laid down his knife . " Old Levi Plummer , " he said reminiscently , swiping at his lips with his napkin . " You children do n't remember your great-great-grandfather . He died a good many years before you were born . Levi Plummer fought in the Civil War and was wounded in the leg  --  Shiloh , I think  --  and after the war gangrene set in . He had four operations . First they amputated his toe , then his ankle , then they cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thigh . It would have killed any other man . In the end it even killed Levi Plummer . He had five hundred acres when he died , good Iowa land , every inch of it , and twelve thousand dollars out in first mortgages . " He was a magnificent specimen  --  commanding , dignified , impressive . Looked like James G. Blaine . Big full beard , grizzied early . A real patriarch . Every morning he 'd stand at the foot of the stairs and call his six boys : ' George ! Joe ! Charlie ! Sam ! Hiram ! Taylor ! ' He had a deep orotund voice . " It was unnecessary to add this , for Grandfather was calling these names in his deepest and most orotund voice . " Then he called his girls , ' Maggie ! Lizzie ! Ann ! Jane ! Nora ! Ellen " " I 'll bet Lizzie did n't always get up when he called , " said my sister . Elizabeth was Grandfather 's mother and my sister is named after her . " She certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Levi spoke . That was one house in which children obeyed . Even his wife was afraid of him . She always referred to him as ' Plummer . ' " " A nice character , " said my sister , " going round scaring his wife and children with his deep orotund voice . " " What about the Tavern ? " / asked . I wanted him freshly committed to the story . " It 's still standing , " he said . " You children should drive back there to Greencastle and visit it sometime . From here in Shelby County , it 's not more than a hundred-and-fifty-mile drive . " Of course we did n't interrupt to tell him that we had just done that very thing . " In those days the stagecoach stopped there . It forded the Skunk just west of Plummer 's and changed horses at the Tavern . Blue wheels and canary-colored body , that was the early stagecoach . " Grandfather began drinking his tea , filling the cup with the invariable eight soda crackers . " Most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " but once I remember the stagecoach coming in . The driver was a fellow by the name of Bannister Brailey . He came driving those six horses up to the Tavern at a smart clip and he stood up , I remember  --  he had all the lines knotted together  --  and he stood up and slewed to a stop , and then he jumped , throwing the lines to Levi Plummer , and made a beeline for the house . He was prancing , I 'll tell you . It was along in the spring and crossing the river ? I suppose it was high ; it always was in the spring  --  one of the lead horses snarled her harness and he 'd had to wade out there up to his armpits in the river and free her and afterwards on the box in the wind he was freezing . I 'll never forget that Bannister Brailey , standing up in his frozen clothes , tossing the lines to my grandfather on the ground , and leaping off before the horses stopped . He never waited for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What about the Tavern ? " I demanded . He had to be nailed down to the story or he would wriggle out of it . " What would Betty and I see if we did go back there ? " Grandfather 's teaspoon had disappeared as usual and instead of asking for another he worked himself up without any explanation and shuffled out to the pantry , dragging his right leg a little as he does now since his stroke last fall . Watching that game leg hurts , because Grandfather was always proud of his agility . Right up to the stroke he used to entertain on the slightest provocation with a little shuffling jig that he called " the wiling-ding . " No one dares mention it any more . Now he came back with a tablespoon , which infuriates Grandmother ? acting as if she did n't have enough teaspoons  --  but I really believe he prefers the larger spoon for eating his crackers soaked in tea . Grandmother started scolding him , but he paid no attention . " Things have a way of shrinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Tavern would Look so big to me now as it did then . But it was a fine big house for those days , better than most people had , and finished all inside with walnut . The thing I remember most in particular was the public room of the Tavern . That 's what you 'd look for first if you went back there . The public room went up thirty feet  --  two full stories  --  and up above there was a balcony and the bedrooms upstairs opened off this balcony , same as in all old-fashioned hotels . I can remember as if it were yesterday , peeking through the balcony railing down at that big room as big as a barn it seemed to me then . " HERE it was , more or less complete , the way he always told it . " You want us to believe that , do n't you , Grandpa ? " my sister began , scornfully sweet . He was undoing the cellophane from the one after-dinner cigar that the doctor allows him . She put him on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe it to eat at my table , " he said mildly . She fiddle-faddled with our triumph . " It was all imagination , was n't it ? " she coaxed . " First you imagined that big room , two stories high , and then you told about it so often that you came to believe it almost , did n't you ? " " No , " he said slowly , " I saw that room . " He spoke strongly and she was flustered . " Then where is it ? " she cried . " Where is it ? " She threw her hands around like a three-year-old . He caught on at once . " If you 've been out there , " he said , " you did n't find the room . I could have told you that beforehand . I drove out there thirty years ago , hired a rig from the livery stable in Greencastle and drove out there , and the house was changed then . They 'd put flooring across and converted the upper part into a bedroom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all the woodwork and paneling of walnut ? " . " No , " I said . " That so ? " he remarked , imperturbable , tipping his ashes into the tea saucer with an ash tray squarely in front of him . Grandmother remonstrated . " Probably ripped out the walnut and sold it during the First World War for gunstocks . Walnut was high then . That 's where it went . " " Do you mean to say , " belligerently shouted my sister , " that you 've been telling us all our lives to go see a Plummer Tavern that you knew did n't exist ? " My sister is excitable . " That you deliberately sent us on a wild-goose chase ? " " If you 'd listened to me a bit more carefully , " he retorted , matching her violence , " you 'd have noticed that I 've never said what you 'd find if you went out there now . " " We just asked you what we 'd find , " Betty contradicted , " and you said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put words in my mouth , young lady . What I just said ? " Grandmother pounded on the table with a knife handle . She had the look round her lips that means business . " You stop raising your voice , " she told Grandfather . " Remember your color . The doctor said you had to keep your color down . And your voice . " " You 're flushed up like a peony yourself , " he told her . " You keep out of this . This is a peaceable argument until you and the doctors get in it . Betty is n't going to twist my words with me sitting here able to open my mouth and contradict her . I do n't care what the doctors say . " " Contradict her quietly , " said Grandmother . Grandfather snorted , but he did lower his voice . " I 've never said what you 'd find there now . I 've always described it the way it was , the way I remember it . It 's been quite a while ago . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved west here to Shelby County . In the spring of ' 73 we packed up and moved west . " We had n't finished with him . On our trip , Betty had remembered Bannister Brailey and we had stopped at the Greencastle post office and inquired for him . It turned out that Bannister Brailey was dead but he had a daughter , now Mrs. R. B. Yount . She was about sixty and had been indignant at the suggestion that her father , Bannister Brailey , might have driven a stagecoach in his youth . I think she considered stagecoach-driving fit occu pation only for limbs of the devil . She had been positive her father had n't , Besides being a respectable farmer all his life , Bannister Brailey had been nothing less than a Free Methodist . After correcting us , Mrs. Yount had shut the door in our faces . We reported this . Grandfather surprised us . Instead of arguing , he remembered some new facts that we had never heard before . " I 'll tell you , " he confessed after reflection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brailey . I remember after we came out here to Shelby County , one winter a bobsled stopped in the road and a man got out and broke his way through the drifts up to our house . He was Bannister Brailey and he stayed with us that night and slept in my bed . And I remember my father and mother and Bannister Brailey talking that evening and what they talked about were the old stagecoach days . That 's where I found out that Bannister Brailey drove the stagecoach . I got it that night . And I still think he did . " " His own daughter to the contrary notwithstanding , " said my sister . " Daughters do n't know everything . " " I 'm sure of it , " said my sister . " Grand . daughters are different . " " Another thing I remember about Bannister Brailey , " he went on , " is that we had a well down by the slough , and even in winter , unless we melted snow , we had to go for water ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to the well with the team , and coming back Bannister Brailey was holding the bucket out to one side to keep the water from slopping on him and my father drove badly and the sled tipped over and Bannister Brailey spilled water all over his clothes . " . " And made a beeline for the house , " shouted my sister , spilling her coffee as she put down her cup in her excitement . " There you have the entire basis for the story of Bannister Brailey , the stagecoach driver , tearing up from Skunk River in his wet clothes , his six horses in a lather , jumping off and running for the house ! " Even Grandfather looked momentarily startled . He worked at his cigar for a full minute and then he shook his head . " No , " he said . " It could n't be . I saw that stagecoach . Maybe it was n't Bannister Brailey driving . But I saw that stagecoach . " He shut his eyes . " I still can . " ri snEN the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get to the bottom of it . Betty and I figured there must be Greencastle people , still hale , whose memories went back further than Grandfather 's . We made the trip again and consulted the editor of the local paper , and he suggested Lucy Batchelder , Tanner that was , who 'd had the farm adjoining Plummer 's on the west . Mrs. Batchelder was eighty-eight . Her daughter asked us in . Mrs. Batchelder was sitting in a rocker  --  a tall , wasted-away , vinegary old woman , thin as paper , but straight , her long shriveled hands in her lap  --  and she was wearing a sort of old-fashioned mobcap and a spotless blue apron . At first we thought she might be feeble , her voice was so faint and she sat so quietly , her hands folded , her knees together , and her feet in Congress slippers side by side on the floor . In the way she sat , the straightness of her back , the crossing of her emaciated hands , the jointing and folding of that tall spare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positions of an open jackknife . When she was young she must have been one of those long , lanky , unfortunate girls , too tall for any of the boys in the neighborhood . After a few commonplaces with her daughter , I told Mrs. Batchelder that she certainly did n't look eighty-eight . She resented the remark . She gave me a sharp look , as much as to say that fine words did n't take her in and that I was a liar . With the flash of those suspicious old eyes , I knew there was nothing feeble about her . Her voice quavered a little before it settled down . " So you 're Plummers ? " she began , after I had explained what we were after . " You look kind of like Plummers . My stars , though , you 're too young to tell . The Plummers was always built short and chunky , fleshed up early , and they never lived long . Got unhealthy fat  --  kind that dies of diabetes . Doctors did n't know what it was then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died of diabetes . I remember it was raining and the minister stopped . " ' Been burying today , ' he says . " ' Who ? ' says Pa . " Old Levi Plummer , ' says the Reverend Lampman . " ' What ! ' says Pa , was over to see Levi just a couple days ago . A little bedridden but as mean as ever . ' " ' Well , ' says the Reverend Lampman , he 's gone . I was hard put to say something for Levi . It rained like pitchforks all the time I was a-burying him . ' " ' Could have said he was good to his stock , ' says Pa . ' Never seen a heifer fatten up like she 'd do for Levi . " Mrs. Batchelder had begun to rock gently , lifting and lowering her heels . She folded her long arms . " I remember that between Reverend Lampman and Pa like it was yesterday . It was still a-raining outside and that was the day Levi Plummer was buried . He always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meditated a moment . " He was a peculiar man , Levi Plummer , peculiar . Little pig eyes and his ears laid back , did n't stand out natural . Crazy as a betsey bug most of the time . Never got along with people , Levi did n't . To begin with he was from Kentucky , a slavery man . During the war I guess he never dared stick his head out of doors in the night . Copperhead , that 's what he was . He paid a bushel basket of gold to keep his boys out of the war . Heard him say so myself . Feeling run so high they went one night and tarred and feathered the fence posts front of his house . He hushed down after that . " I mentioned Bannister Brailey and the Tavern . " Ca n't say , " she said , rocking more decidedly , " but would n't be surprised . Bannister Brailey 'd drive anything that was heading fast for blazes , that one would . W-Ist drove his pa and ma mad ' fore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down , I can tell you . " Every now and then in her rocking , Mrs. Batchelder 's bony hand went up , her head came down , she fingered the lobe of her right ear , gave it a slight tug , and folded her arms again without interrupting the running of her talk by so much as a breath . " About that stagecoach . Never seen ' one in my time . Railroad come through in ' 66 . After the railroads there was n't no use for stagecoaches . I must have seen ' em but I do n't remember ' em . I 've heard ' em talk about Plummer Tavern , though . That house out there now that you seen , that ai n't Plummer Tavern . That house out there was built right after the Civil War . We built a house the year after the war , first house around here was n't made of native timber . My pa , he ordered pine from Chicago . One day when it was a-building , Levi Plummer come over to look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next year he built . Bought his pine from Chicago , same as Pa told him to . He finished the house up nice inside , I 'll say that for him . All walnut fixings . Had a lot of land there , was n't good for nothing but walnut and hazclbrush and such like . Was n't smart , Levi Plummer . Did n't get the best land when he could . All the county to choose from when he come out here  --  Levi Plummer was one of the first  --  but cockleburs and horseweeds is what he bought from the government . " I remember the old Tavern , little squatty building , one room of logs , other room of boards and battens , linn I guess , fireplace at each end . Tore it down in the eighties . Never knowed how they all lived in that house , Levi and his wife and twelve children , I think it was , and there was old Grandma Morrow as lived with them , ugly-tempered as sin . After her limbs was paralyzed she 'd sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep ' em from coming in . Then there was uncle John Morrow too . He was a cripple . Fell off a horse , I guess , and walked with a cane . I never knowed where they put them all . Boys must have slept in the barn . Joe , I know , he said he used to sleep in the barn . ' You sleep in the hay , ' he says , ' and it 'll make your hair Joe Plummer , he had the prettiest head " Mrs. Batchelder tugged at her ear , but this time she interrupted herself , and her voice trailed off and slowly she ceased to rock . For a full minute she was silent . Then she glanced at us suspiciously , as if we might have been reading her thoughts , folded her arms , and sniffed . The sniff was a crushing judgment . " Tavern , they called it , " she said contemptuously , resuming her rocking . " Do n't know why . Changed horses there . That 's all they ever done . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before they built the new house . " Her arms tightened . " Was n't no lace on their petticoats , I can tell you . How old you say your grandfather is ? Seventy-three . What he seen was the balcony round the portico of the new house . That 's what he seen . Ca n't believe what children remembers . Levi Plummer put a portico front of his house . Round the top of the portico there was a gimcracky railing . That 's what your grandpa seen when he looked out the upstairs window . Levi Plummer put it there because we did n't have one . Right after the war it was . He was fixing to be pretty fine . " But his wife looked out the window one day , watched him going down to the barn . Right off she seen he did n't look right . One shoulder higher'n the other , slumping along , do n't look right . ' What 's the matter with your foot ? ' she says . You do n't walk right . ' Nothing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' I 'm going to wash your feet , ' she says . He would n't hear of it . But she done it . Front of his toe there was a sore , mean pussy-looking sore . Had to have his toe off . Then they broke out on his leg . Diabetes , that 's what it was , but doctors did n't know . Seems like he could n't get enough sugar . Had a craving . Sugar costs money . Wife hid the sugar bowl and he 'd sneak down cellar and eat up her preserves . Had to have sweet stuff . That 's the way diabetes takes you . When those sores was a-running , Levi Plummer was himself , but when they healed , he was crazy as a betsey bug . His wife found the butcher knife under his pillow . ' I 'm ' fraid for my life of him , ' she told Mahala Baker , but she never let him know , spunked right up to him always . One day he tried to kill hisself , propped his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head off . Joe Plummer , he kicked the gun over just in time . " That Joe Plummer was a holy terror . When he got hold of you , you 'd better look out . All them Plummer boys was devils . Spiteful and mean , that 's what they mostly was . Levi 'd say to Joe , Joe , I want you to use the sorrels today on the back forty , ' and fifteen minutes after he 'd look from the window and there 'd be Joe driving the blacks on the front eighty . Or he 'd say , ' George , I want you to put new riders on the fence , ' and George would say , ' I 'll ride you , old man , that 's what I 'll do . ' That was the way they talked to him , and him in bed with his sores . He had a red muley cow and Sam sold her and kept the money . The boys stealed off their father right and left . And the doctors had his leg off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one summer I tried to work for Ma Plummer . Three days of the Plummers was all I could stand . That Joe Plummer he was a devil . He could make you laugh and laugh when he wanted to and the next minute you 'd like to smack him down . When old Levi died they all took to fighting among themselves . There was n't one of them could be sweet enough to Ma Plummer . She had the money . And oh my , how they did hate each other . It got to be a scandal almost . They hated Joe the most because he could get round his ma . But Joe , he was n't dependable . ' You do n't want ever to get mixed up with those Plummers , ' my pa says to me . There 's had blood in all of ' em . ' And there was . " She stopped rocking . " I never consorted with none of ' em , " Mrs. Batchelder said firmly . W HEN we related it all , Grandfather immediately pooh-poohed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joe would n't have her . I remember that story . I would n't believe Mrs. Batchelder under oath . I do n't believe she was even living around Greencastle when we left in ' 73 . I certainly do n't recall her . " " I believe her , " Betty insisted . " So do I , " I said . " Mrs. Batchelder is eighty-eight . She was a girl in her teens when you were born . Naturally she remembers better than you do . I can see the process . After you get to Shelby County , your mother tells you about the gimcracky railing on the outside portico of her old home and in your mind you turn it into the inside balcony for an enormous public tavern room , two stories high . " " You probably did n't know what a portico was , " Betty suggested . " Your mother told you other things , " I said , " and then , childlike , you garbled it in your mind until now you remember things that happened to your mother before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like the stagecoach , because your mother was older than Mrs. Batchelder . " Grandmother leaned over to Betty and they whispered together . Betty alertly sat up . " How old are you , Grandpa ? " " Seventy-three , " said Grandmother , " and his birthday is on the 3rd of June . " My sister calculated painfully . Grandfather gibed at her . " You 'll never manage sums in your head , " he told her , " unless you learn how to wrap your tongue round your teeth correctly . " " You were born on June 3 , 1871 , " she charged , " and you left Greencastle to come west out here to Shelby County in 1873 , so all these things you 've been telling us happened before you were two years old . Is n't that precocious , Grandpa , even for you ? " I could have kicked myself for not having thought it through before . " Who said I was born in 1871 ? " he countered mildly . " I never said that . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ' 68 , " he insisted , and became suddenly heated . " Your grandmother invented the other . I ought to know . I 'm seventy-six . Let 's see . I was ? " " Careful , Grandpa , careful . Get your arithmetic right . " " I was five , " he asserted , fully aroused . " It 's not a matter of arithmetic . It 's a fact . A child of five remembers a lot . Such things as I 've told you I remember distinctly . They 're parr of me . My mind is n't cluttered up with supposes . It 's filled with the things that have actually happened . I 'll remember what I remember as long as I live . It 's built into me , part and parcel , like my own bones . You are n't going to make me forget things , Betty , after remembering them all my life . Why , I can see that stagecoach , every detail . " He shut his eyes ; the lids screwed together . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blue fellies . " Then he snorted with the vigor of his certitude , opened his eyes , and stood up carefully because of his leg . " I 'd be the first to admit that my memory had played me false if any evidence were forthcoming , " he announced , retreating with dignity toward his newspaper . We made disbelieving murmurs . " There has n't been any evidence yet . " He picked up the newspaper . " I 'd like less loose talk and more proof . " Behind his newspaper he is unassailable . It is his way of retiring from the field . " Stop talking and get proof for a change , " he said , and disappeared behind the sheet . " Let 's prove it , " Betty said to me . " How ? " I said . " You would n't know proof from prunes . " " Maybe she would , " Grandmother said . " Listen , Betty , go up to the attic . On the right-hand side there is a pile of screens and behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheels and right near there is a family Bible . I think it 's down in the foot of the baby carriage . " Grandfather lowered his newspaper . " You keep out of this , " he warned Grandmother , his voice suddenly violent . " I 'm sure you want to get at the truth , " she told him severely . In ten minutes Betty came down , yip , ping jubilantly . " You were born on June 3 , 1871 , " she proclaimed , reading the entry . " So at the most , since you moved from Greencastle to Shelby County in 1873 , you were only " ? she sat on the arm of his chair , wriggling with excitement ? " two years and a few months old when you arrived here . Everything you 've been talking about happened back in Greencastle before that . " Calmly he laid down the newspaper . " Let 's see the page , " he demanded . The book was too heavy for him to hold , but no one dared remind him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table , " he ordered . He dragged back to the table and sat down with the book before him . " There must have been two Levi Plummers , " cried my sister , dancing behind his chair . Teasing , she shook his shoulder . " You and Mrs. Batchelder do n't agree very well . Someone must be given tomisremembering , huh , Grandpa ? " She hovered by his ear . " Huh ? " Grandfather was n't listening . He was engrossed in the entries in the back of the Bible . Now he looked up . " Levi Plummer was only sixty-three when he died , " he exclaimed , pointing on the page . I think he was startled . " I 've always thought of Levi Plummer as an old , old man . " He turned on my sister unexpectedly . " Sit down , " he commanded . She did n't sit down , but she subsided slightly . " There were two Levi Plummers , " he agreed , suddenly stern . " You children do n't know the length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know what time is . " " I 've waited two days to spring Mrs. Batchelder on you , " cried my sister . " Be quiet , " he said . " You 've been hearing about a man 's life . It did n't happen in an instant . " He pointed again at the page . " It lasted sixty-three years . Old Levi Plummer lasted sixty-three years . He died in 1883 . And there were two of him . There usually are . There 's a sick man at the end , dragging around for months and years , half-paralyzed . Mrs. Batchelder knew the sick Levi Plummer . That 's the one she 's chosen to remember . That 's the one she told you about . Before that there was another man that all his life was well and strong . My mother knew the other Levi Plummer , the well one . That 's the one she told me about and that 's the one I 've told you about . That 's the one to remember , the one that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matters . I want you always to remember the one that was well and strong " ? he stood up , hands on the table , tentative because of his leg ? " the one that was able to ' do the whingding ' if he liked , " he added gruffly . My sister is irrepressible at times . " If it was your mother 's Levi Plummer that you knew , " she put in , " then it was your mother 's stagecoach , was n't it ? " Our grandfather closed the cover on the family page . He abruptly shoved the book from him . I think he included us all in that shove . " No , " he said . " That was my stagecoach . ' . !
