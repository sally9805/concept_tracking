Lisle Bell has probably reviewed more books than anyone in the world . Total is now around 17,000 . But even among reviewers in Manhattan , where he has practiced his craft for 26 years , Bell is almost unknown . The reason : he specializes in the brief , unsigned booknote , turns them out at the rate of twelve a week . <P> The few of his fellow craftsmen who know him consider him the most skilled practitioner of a most difficult kind of book reviewing . Critic Van Wyck Brooks , when he edited the Freeman , said that Lisle Bell had invented a new form , ranked him with highbrow Scottish Critic Edwin Muir . Poet Marianne Moore , who edited the Dial 's brief booknotes for the ten years Bell contributed , called one cluster of his reviews the best thing she had seen . The reason why Reviewer Bell has never received recognition for his services to U.S. letters : his 17,000 reviews have been written as a sideline , while he was working as a newspaperman , turning out a newspaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comedies . <P> Christmas Package . The typical Lisle Bell review is a 200-or 300-word synthesis , usually of a light novel , with its plot outlined , setting and characters identified in one sentence , the author 's distinctive quality set down accurately in unhackneyed terms in another , and the paragraph wound up as neatly as a Christmas package , with an amiable ironic phrase . His reviews are seldom malicious , very rarely given to unqualified praise . But only experts , looking back over Bell 's collected works , can appreciate how outspoken he has been about many forgotten figures among literature 's briefly great . Occasionally , but not often , Bell reviews at length a book given him for a book-note . One such was Dr. Axel Munthe 's recollections , The Story of San Michele ( it was neglected by publishers who thought it was a travel book ) . Bell 's favorable comment in the Herald Tribune Books was its only Manhattan review . The book sold 250,000 copies . <P> High-Power Condenser . Now 51 , the son of a real-estate dealer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reviews as soon as he got out of high school . When he was a 19-year-old cub reporter on the Ohio State Journal at Columbus he wrote the paper 's book reviews for nothing in his spare time . <P> Soon after Bell reached Manhattan , the late Clarence Britten hired him to write the Dial 's brief reviews . That extraordinary literary journal carried pages of condensed reviews , most of which Bell wrote , and which for literary quality and precision of judgment ranked with the best writing in the magazine . <P> He also did the booknotes for the Nation . When Irita Van Doren became editor of the Herald Tribune 's book section ( 1926 ) , she got Bell to do its brief reviews . He has been doing them ever since . In one summer-fiction number of the supplement he guided readers to 65 examples of hammock reading , wrote nine reviews and a long article summarizing the year 's light fiction-almost half the supplement . <P> Last week Reviewer Bell 's output was temporarily curtailed . With a constitutional weakness in his legs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fortnight ago , he fell again , broke the other one .
