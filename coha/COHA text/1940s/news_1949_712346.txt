txt BRITONS TAKE CUT WITH RESIGNATION What Worry Is Shown in Calm Acceptance Is Over Prices ? Step Held Painful Necessity By TANIA LONG Sm. -. la ' to TAE NEW MORE nuts . LONDON , Sept. ** were only about fifty persons outside 10 Downing Street tonight when Sir Stafford Cripps made his announcement of devaluation of the pound . They were some of the few in London who knew in advance that the Chancellor of the Exchequer was to speak , and all of them had come in the hope of seeing him leave for Broadcasting House . While a single bobby kept the crowd together on the sidewalk facing the Chancellor 's home there was a lot of good-natured joshing back and forth as newcomers arrived to join the group . " Well , we will all know the bad news soon , " said one to his neighbor . " The old man 's come back from America with a pound worth only four and sixpence . " " Yes .. and no more American tobacco for us , I 'll bet , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunday night appearance , only // BRITONS TAKE CUT WITH RESIGNATION // those who had heard the 6 o'clock radio news were aware that Sir Stafford Cripps was to speak at 9 and many Londoners were out enjoying the evening air , watching a movie or having a drink in their favorite pub . There were crowds in Piccadilly Circus and Leicester Square , and even strollers in Whitehall gave no more than a casual glance into the gloomy deadend street that-is the  --  home of the Prime Minister and of the Chancellor of the Exchequer . Nor when news of the devaluation had spread was the calm of this Sunday evening greatly disturbed . Most people accepted the news stolidly ; the general tenor of comment was " the Government knows best " If they worried at all it was not about the fact that the pound was to have a lower exchange rate abroad but that it would have smaller purchasing power at home . Women , especially , spoke of the increase in the price of bread and wondered whether bacem and other rfoods imported from hard currency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , was one of acceptance of devaluation as inevitable , as the better of two evils if the alternative , as Sir Stafford said , was to be unemployment . " We do n't want any more of thtit in this country " was a comment from an old-timer , who said he had spent four years on the dole after the first World War . The British press , which is largely Conservative , in general did not attack the Labor Government for its action . The consensus was that the lowering of the pound rate was a painful but necessary move . Stating that it was no longer possible for Sir Stafford to postpone the decision and that the i " facts have had their final word , " The Times of London said that the Washington conference " by ordinary standards had more successes than failures . " The Times warned that the external value of sterling must in. future be matched by a firm internal policy . The editorial added : " Devaluation , however this unpalatable truth may be disguised , is in part at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been expecting more and getting more in some of their international exchanges than they have really earned . " The Daily Telegraph , which warns its readers that " no mere device like devaluation can cure our economic and financial ills " and describes it as at best " a shot in the arm , " concludes : " Devaluation shows that the honeymoon time of dollar subsidized socialism has drawn to a close ; and that there is no alternative now but to ' face up to the harsh realities of our economic situation . How harsh they are can scarcely be exaggerated . We are right . up against things and there is no way out save by hard work ? and tight belts . " Both The Daily Express and the Daily Mail argue that it might have been better to allow the pound to go free and find its own level . " Let every foreign country pay what it thinks the pound is worth , " says the Express , which calls Sir Stafford 's speech courageous , cogent and brilliant . " Let the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other currencies as it once did  --  to Britain 's advantage * * but the Socialists will never consent to free the pound , " the Express continued . " It would mean abandonment of their system of controls * * * . If you set money free you set the people free . And in a semi-police state the people can never be free . " The Communist Daily Worker , which continues its fulminations against what it calls Britain 's " Marshall slavery , " is the only London newspaper to press for an increase in workers ' wages . Stating that devaluation means a substantial cut in earnings , the editorial says : " The trade union leadership will be guilty of base betrayals of their membership if they do not immediately decide to fight for an increase in wages to offset the increased prices which will certainly result from devaluation .
