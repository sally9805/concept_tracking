The tightest , grimmest war shortage facing the U.S. is rubber . It need not have been . For five months after Pearl Harbor the U.S. government did practically nothing effective to get a synthetic rubber industry created to fill the gap caused by Japan 's conquests . That failure is the worst scandal of the U.S. war effort ; the sort of scandal which , in another country , would have cost a couple of Ministers their jobs or perhaps have toppled a whole government . Only in the past eight weeks has a new team , with a passion for anonymity , arisen in Washington to take hold of the synthetic-rubber program and push it through , come hell or high water . Only now are there some grounds for honest optimism . <P> Barring acts of God , the U.S. is scheduled to produce in 1943 between 275,000 and 325,000 tons of synthetic rubber-starvation rations . More important , it will have at 1943 's end the capacity to produce 800,000 tons in 1944-which begins to approach the United Nations ' essential needs . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) Of that 800,000 tons , 100,000 will be specialty rubbers ; 60,000 , Standard Oil 's famed butyl ; 40,000 , Du Font 's long-established neoprene-strategic for self-sealing gas tanks , oil-resistant hose lines , etc . The rest will be what chemists designate as Buna-S , which has recently given road-test performances up to 130-160% of the best wearing qualities of natural rubber . The emergence of Buna-S almost unquestionably means that natural rubber will be a deader commodity at the end of this war than natural nitrates were at the end of the last. * The estimated cost of the Buna program now ( $500 per ton of plant capacity ) is only half what it was five months ago , and oilmen confidently believe that , by the end of the war , costs ( combined with quality ) will meet and lick natural rubber . <P> Buna-S , conceived long ago , has had a most painful birth . It is produced by uniting , through heat , pressure and catalysts , two chemicals , butadiene ( bewta-die'een ) ( 75% ) and styrene ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dow Chemical and Monsanto should be adequately big factors in producing it . The bloody salient of the synthetic-rubber battle has been butadiene which , except for synthetic rubber , has so far no other reason for existence . Once the plants are created and producing , the problem again becomes simple ; the rubber companies in their existing plants take the combined ( " co-polymerized " ) butadiene-styrene product , use it like natural rubber . <P> Why were the butadiene plants and the polymerizing plants not built ? <P> Before Pearl Harbor synthetic rubber was regarded as the average man regards his life insurance : protection against the unthinkable . NDAC 's Ed Stettinius pleaded for 100,000 tons of insurance . But to Jesse Jones the rates seemed too high . They obviously were too high for large-scale private investment so long as Buna-S cost 25-35 a Ib. and natural rubber , even at war-kited rates , only 20 . In May 1941 , the same day that his RFC head . Emil Schram , told Congress " I think we will have to start rationing rubber very soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut off from the Far East synthetic rubber would be a great waste of money .
