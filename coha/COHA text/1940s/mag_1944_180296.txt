" Charles , the third of the Navy 's team of officer-brothers , was at the hospital this week . He had come out of his last fight hit in more than 200 places . <P> On the chests of the Crommelin brothers are decorations , citations and campaign ribbons from every naval theater of this war . On some of the Crommelin hides , enough medical work has been performed to fill a medical volume . <P> Alabama Born . Long ago , on their plantation near Montgomery ( Ala . ) , Mr. &; Mrs. John Crommelin decided that Southern boys need discipline . John Jr. , their eldest , was sent off experimentally to the Naval Academy . The experiment worked , so one by one the other boys-Henry , Charles , Richard , Quentin-were launched in John 's wake . <P> Four of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign , Captain John , 41 , served as air officer on carriers , including the ill-fated Liscome Bay . Commander Henry , 39 , whose eyes had kept him out of aviation , commanded a destroyer in the Atlantic , took part in the North African invasion , finally went to the Pacific in command of a destroyer division . <P> Commander Charles , 34 , having somehow survived a plane-shattering crash , spent three months in the hospital , went out to the Pacific as a fighter pilot . Lieut . Richard , 27 , a fighter pilot in one of the old Yorktown 's famous squadrons , was in the scrap in the Coral Sea . He was shot down but survived to fight at the Battle of Midway .

Naked as a new chick , he made his way through the shattered carrier to the flight deck . ( The Liscome Bay was afire from stem to stern , sinking in a sea of blazing oil . ) John jumped overboard . Badly burned , he was finally plucked out of the ocean by a destroyer . <P> Henry , aboard his destroyer in the same engagement , stood in to Tarawa 's lagoon firing at almost point-blank range on Jap shore batteries . Direct hits on his ship did not discourage Henry , who blazed away with even more enthusiasm . <P> Hospital Bound . Charles , leading a strafing attack over the nearby Marshalls , ran into ack-ack . Windshield and instrument panel exploded and more than 200 particles of glass and metal were driven into his face and body . Blinded in one eye and drenched with blood , Charles made a perfect landing on his carrier . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop off in front of the Officers ' Club .
