txt Asks Heavier Tax to Secure Future The account of Senator George 's address in this morning 's TIMES makes me anxious to assure the many timid souls in Congress that nothing could shatter my morale much more than their failure to pass an adequate tax bill . Our annual income is less than $4,000 , and we have one child . And to improve my morale I 'd like compulsory savings plus an income tax which will make it impossible for us to spend money on anything but absolute necessities , with a rigid price control program that will prevent our being caught in a squeeze . It is most alarming to me that we are feeling the war so little now . I know we ca n't get away with it indefinitely . Wo n't Congress please , please make it a little harder for us now so that we can have some hope for the future ! GRACE F. PATRICK . East Orange , N. J. , Jan. 8 , 1944.               @ @ @ @ @ @
