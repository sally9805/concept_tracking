Squirrels doggedly went on gathering nuts . Oak trees continued to shed their leaves , though with an embarrassed air as if committing some social indiscretion . But other flora and fauna rebelliously refused to believe that it was really autumn . Shad ( rarely seen after August ) swam back up New Jersey streams , querulously tried to spawn . The giddier of Washington 's famed cherry trees blossomed . Dogs panted in upstate New York , which had been blanketed by snow four weeks before . Flies came dazedly back to life , mosquitoes whined , roses and lilacs budded . An ostrich in the Cleveland zoo squatted with springtime ceremony and laid an egg . <P> Though it was high time for frost , temperatures stood at August levels from the Great Lakes to the Eastern seaboard . Manhattan small fry celebrated the hottest Halloween on record ( 81 ) by donning masks-and going naked on the beach ( see cut ) . As the hot spell wore on , thermometers registered highs of 84 in Washington , 82 in Philadelphia , 81 in Boston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmers mopped their foreheads and cursed the humidity which was delaying the corn harvest . Mississippians sighed and put off their hog killing . Thousands of city folk got out their lawn mowers-the grass was growing again . <P> The weather was just as unseasonable elsewhere in the U.S. As it got warm where it should have been cold , it got cold where it should have been warm . Storm warnings were flown off the California coast . Fresno had an October freeze for the first time since weather records were begun in 1887 ; at Sacramento the earliest recorded frost damaged tons of olives . <P> Meanwhile full winter descended , without warning , on the Rocky Mountain states . It began snowing in Utah , Nevada and Montana , and the worst blizzard in a decade roared down on Colorado . Hunters were trapped , cars stalled , trains delayed and the intermountain sugar-beet harvest was almost completely disrupted . <P> Those Long Stripes . At week 's end things were gradually getting back to normal . U.S. Weather Bureau forecasters , who had refused to share the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of isobars and occluded fronts and went back to peering at their charts and thermometers . Eastern beaches were deserted again . But thousands of amateur weather prophets , who accepted the whole business as a call to arms , were busily trying to discover what it portended . <P> According to early returns , the U.S. was certain to have a hard winter . There was some corroborating data from the amateurs . Connecticut prognosticators said the stripes on caterpillars had been extremely long last summer-a sure sign of a tough winter ahead . Southern hunters announced that squirrel fur was the thickest in years . But more fastidious prophets refused to talk until mid-November , which is the best time for studying chicken bones and sweet-corn tassels . Dark bones and dark tassels mean a cold winter coming .
