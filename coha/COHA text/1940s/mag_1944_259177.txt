Boys &; girls from the working and lower-middle classes should be admitted at Government expense to Eton , Harrow and the 318 other English " public " ( i.e. , private ) schools . Such was the revolutionary proposal , last week , of a special Parliamentary committee , headed by Lord Fleming . Its 65,000-word report recommended that up to 25% of public-school enrollment should come from economic groups unable to pay the 80 to 280 tuition fees . <P> Rooted deep in the past ( Winchester was founded in 1382 , Eton in 1440 ) , the public schools have for centuries been the exclusive preserves of Britain 's ruling classes . But the notion of changing this cherished status quo sprang from no proletarian revolt . It came from the public schools themselves , as they saw their enrollments cut by depression , by a declining birth rate , by upped income taxes . <P> Says the Very Rev. Dr. Cyril Alington , Dean of Durham and onetime headmaster of Eton : " Of course all public schools should be open to everyone . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Enriched Inheritance . The Fleming committee proposal is not included in Britain 's famed Education Bill , but may be added later . The Education Bill , described by Minister of Education Richard A. ( " Rab " ) Butler as the most far-reaching reform measure in Britain 's educational history , is expected to become law this week . By it Britain will take a long step forward on the road to genuine equality of opportunity for its children . <P> At present , schooling ends for 85% of British children at the age of 14 . Only one in ten of the 5,000,000 children of school age completes high school . The Education Bill provides : 1 ) compulsory school attendance to 15 ( later to be upped to 16 ) ; 2 ) county colleges , which youths of 15 to 18 must attend one day a week ; 3 ) free nursery schools ; 4 ) more university scholarships , more &; better technical schools . <P> The project will raise the public cost of English and Welsh education by a hundred million pounds , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own educational system , is not included . ) But Tories , Laborites and Liberals alike are determined to " secure for children a happier childhood and a better start in life . . . provide means for all of developing the various talents with which they are endowed and so enriching the inheritance of the country .
