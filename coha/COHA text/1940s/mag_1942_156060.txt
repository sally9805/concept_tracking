The fighter plane-of-the-year is headed for quantity production . Republic Aviation Corp . ' s sleek brute of the substratosphere , the P-47 Thunderbolt ( TIME , Jan. 12 ) , has released its design to other manufacturers . That much , and no more . Army censorship allowed Republic to announce last week in its annual statement to stockholders . <P> To airmen who have flown the Thunderbolt , a slick-handling job for all its weight ( around 13,500-lb. , about the same as an old Ford trimotor transport ) , this was news , good &; hot . At Republic 's Long Island plant , P-47 was already in production . But if the heavily armed and armored fighter is to do the job the Air Forces says it can , more room for growth is needed than there is in Republic 's big , spanking-new plant . <P> Pleased as anyone at the Air Forces ' recognition of P-47 's good qualities was the Thunderbolt 's father , a quiet , wiry onetime Russian Army artillerist named Alexander Kartveli . In the great group effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new craft in the air has escaped public attention . One such is 45-year-old Designer Kartveli . <P> After World War I , Artillerist Kartveli went to France , studied aeronautics , supported himself for a year by a trapeze act in a circus . Meanwhile he learned to fly . His passion was the all-metal airplane . He designed one in 1927-a failure . But by last fall he was a recognized designer at Republic , the head of a department of 200 engineers ( who call him Mister ) . <P> P-47 was his design from the first sheet of paper up , but when Republic set out to patent it in his name they ran into Kartveli trouble . Three days were lost persuading stubborn Alexander Kartveli that he should sign the application alone , and not , as he insisted , append the names of some 125 engineer helpers . <P> Today Bachelor Kartveli , like other top-drawer ideamen in aviation , is busy about next year 's design . But sometimes he goes out on the field to watch his 2,000-h.p . ( Pratt &; Whitney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beast . " A nice plane , " he admits , in an accent tinged with French , rather than Russian . " But she 's too big . " Airmen who fly the beast could argue with him , but they do n't . They know it 's an esthete 's criticism .
