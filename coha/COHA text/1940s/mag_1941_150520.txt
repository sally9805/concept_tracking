To taxpayers who had hoped that they might soon get rid of the old shouldergalling burden of relief , WPA 's new , handsome chief , Howard Hunter , last week made the announcement that the poor are still with the U.S.-and will be for some time to come . <P> WPA lists have shrunk from their all time high of 3,364,000 in October 1938 . But in the fiscal year that ends this month , despite the fact that farmers in some parts of the country were crying for workers , a monthly average of 1,700,000 people still counted on the Federal Government to make jobs for them . Hunter hoped to get some of them back into private jobs ( said he : " If we isolate them from the regular economy of the country they 'll be with us until they die " ) , but the chances of defense industry absorbing many of them during the next fiscal year are not very good . <P> Reasons : 1 ) defense work is concentrated in a few areas and a few industries ; 2 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) 18.8% of WPAsters are women ; 4 ) demand is for skilled workers , and65% of WPAsters are unskilled ; 5 ) industry continues to draw the color line and some 15% of WPAsters are Negroes ; 6 ) employers are prejudiced against people with a long record of unemployment . The war itself has added another stricture : employers are turning down Germans and Italians . <P> Hunter prayed that a sympathetic Congress would boost the budget figure ( $875,000,000 ) for operation of WPA in fiscal 1942 ; otherwise , he said , he would have to pare his list 41% to an average monthly roll of 1,000,000 . He also hoped that Congress would lift a prohibition against employment of aliens on relief . This week the House Appropriations Committee , sending a relief bill on to Congress , refused to do either of those things .
