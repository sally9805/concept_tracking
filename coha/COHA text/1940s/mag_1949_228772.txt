When he was a child , Francis Forgione was noted among the villagers of Pietrelcina , Italy for his piety . No one was surprised when he became a Capuchin monk and in due time was ordained a priest under the name Padre Pio-Father Pius . He developed tuberculosis , but continued his priestly duties , though he sometimes fell into ecstatic trances while saying Mass . During one trance , in 1918 , Padre Pio collapsed and had to be carried unconscious from the church . Those who examined him found bleeding wounds in his hands and feet and a wound in his side " such as produced by a sharp weapon . " Padre Pio had the stigmata-the marks of Christ . <P> Old Story . To the Roman Catholic Church this was an old story . St. Francis of Assisi was the first known Stigmatist , * and there have been many subsequent cases ( Dr. A. Imbert-Gourbeyre in his La Stigmatisation , 1894 , collected the records of 321 ) . Modern physicians have examined enough of them , e.g. , famed Bavarian peasant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phenomenon as real , though they do not agree on an entirely satisfactory medical explanation . Padre Pio 's wounds bleed constantly , the wound in his side saturating three to four handkerchiefs each day . The church , which does not hold that stigmata are necessarily caused by supernatural means , at first treated Padre Pio with cautious skepticism . <P> While looking into the phenomenon , the Vatican forbade him to hear confessions or officiate at any public occasion . Only after two years of painstaking investigation by doctors and others , did the church finally lift the ban on the grounds of : 1 ) " the undoubted presence " of the stigmata ; 2 ) Padre Pio 's holy way of life from childhood ; 3 ) proof that " miracles have happened in the presence of Padre Pio . " <P> At the monastery of San Giovanni Rotondo , near Foggia in southeast Italy , 62-year-old Padre Pio now rises at 2 each morning , prays for three hours and begins Mass at 5:30 . Though Mass is normally a matter of some 30 minutes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it because he often groans , weeps or passes into a state of ecstasy . After Mass he begins hearing confessions of the streams of men &; women who wait through the night at the church door in all kinds of weather . Confessions are finished at 1 in the afternoon ; then the bearded Capuchin sits down to his single meal of the day : a bunch of herbs and a few small pieces of bread . <P> New Beds . From all over Christendom pilgrims visit him ( some 80,000 are expected during the coming Holy Year ) , and the church values Padre Pio for his potent influence on the faithful . His mail is voluminous ; five of his brother monks are busy from morning to night answering letters addressed to him from all over the world .
