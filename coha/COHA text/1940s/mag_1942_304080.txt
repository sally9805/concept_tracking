Het is Zoover ( See Cover ) <P> The Eastern Theater of war moved on . Americans still held a corner of Luzon , British still held Singapore , but the Japanese had overrun most of the Philippines and Malaya . Now their attack was rolling on toward their third major objective , the Indies -a new terrain with a new cast of defenders , with new military problems - with new and still bigger stakes to play for . <P> On the morning of May 10 , 1940 , the scrubbed , immaculate city of Bandung , on a Java plateau , seemed unwarily peaceful . Halfway around the world , before dawn in Europe , the Army of the motherland was reeling from the first sudden assault of the German . But that morning in the white-stoned General Headquarters build ing of The Netherlands East Indies in Bandung - there was a cooling breeze , and negligent ease . <P> In the office of the N.E.I. Chief of Staff sat the Japanese Consul General , faultlessly dressed , inscrutable Otosugi Saito , talking pleasantries . From the corridor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , flat overtone to the mellow gurgling rumble of their chief , Major General Hein ter Poorten . Then , as an aide in gleaming white duck showed Saito-san from the room the phone rang . <P> It was the Commander in Chief of the N.E.I. Army , Lieut . General Gerardus J. Berenschot . Hein ter Poorten 's beefy , weather-beaten face was impassive , his great 220-lb. body vastly immobile as he heard the message : " Het is Zoover " - This is it . With the economy of movement characteristic of great bodies , he hung up , pushed a button on his desk . N.E.I. 's well-concerted war plans went into action . <P> Fifteen minutes later , as Saito-san reached the Preanger Hotel in the center of the city , he was shocked and surprised to see armed Dutch soldiers hustling German guests and hotel staff members off to concentration camps . The same thing was going on in all the 3,000-odd islands of Hein ter Poorten 's domain . At the seaports , soldiers had seized every German ship , while others grabbed their officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up their ships ) before there was a chance td use them. * Thus Saito-san saw how quickly Ter Poorten could move . <P> On Dec. 8 , 1941 Otosugi Saito , back home in Tokyo , could not have been much surprised by the first news he heard from the N.E.I. : that within two hours of the attack every Jap in the islands had been interned ; that the Dutch were in action and that one of their submarines had started things going by nosing like a blind mud cat through the shallows on the east coast of Malaya and had sunk four Jap transports . For by now he knew that the Dutch in the Indies were , like his onetime friend Hein ter Poorten , pleasant , poker-faced , indomitable , prepared . <P> They had gone into action at the drop of the Jap 's hat in Pearl Harbor . By now Hein ter Poorten was a lieutenant general . He had been Commander of the N.E.I. Army since October , when General Berenschot was killed in an airplane crash . His planes ranged far out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked closely with the N.E.I. Navy , which was at sea . The Navy commander , Vice Admiral C. E. L. Helfrich , a shorter , stubbier , seagoing edition of Ter Poorten , had sent the fleet out days before .
