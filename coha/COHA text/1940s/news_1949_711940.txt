txt By offer ing to jettison Governor Dewey 's cherished pay-as-you-go policy for financing new state construction , Republican legislative leaders tonight were on the verge of compromising the seven-week-old row within the party over budget and tax increase programs . A meeting of all Republican Senators to pass on the proposed compromise , was called for tomorrow afternoon by Senator Benjamin F. Feinberg , ? Republican majority leader . The call was issued following conferences with spokesmen for the Westchester and Erie County delegations , which have been demanding budget and tax mute . On the expectation that the compromise arrangement would be accepted at tomorrow 's conference , despite the setback it would mean to Governor Dewey as state leader of the Republican party , Senator ' Feinberg said that the budget and tax bills would be called up for a vote on Wednesday . Although details of the compromise offer were kept secret , it is Understood to call for a U8 , - 000,000 reduction in the amount of the budget ? to be financed out of current revenues . Such a cut would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposed by Mr. Dewey , and also reduction of personal income taxes 10 per cent below the level suggested by the Governor . Virtually the entire amount of the savings , according to available information , would be achieved through repeal of .. existing appropriations for grade-crossing eliminations and the use instead of laws providing for the issuance of bonds to finance them . Presumably Governor Dewey has agreed to the compromise , despite the loss of face it means for him , since he discussed the subject for two and a half hours with the Republican ' legislative leaders before the compromise offer was conveyed to the Westchester and Erie groups . Mr. Dewey 's discussions with the legislative leaders were followed by a separate conference with Senator Arthur H. Wicks , chairman of the Senate Finance Committee , and Frank C. Moore , the State Controller , who is responsible for the issuance of all state bonds . Both Senator Wicks and Controller Moore had participated in the earlier conferences . Elimination of the gasoline tax increase , according to estimates available here , would mean a saving of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3,000,000 passenger car owners . The income tax cut would represent a saving of $2.60 for a married - man with two dependents and a $5,000 annual income . For those in the higher brackets it would mean more and for those in lower brackets less . As far as state revenues are concerned , elimination of the gasoline tax increase would mean a loss of $20,000,000 , with truck and bus owners sharing in the benefits to the extent of $5,000,000 . Cutting income tax rates 10 per cent below the levels suggested by the Governor would cost $28,000,000 . About $1,000,000 of this revenue cut could be recouped if the Governor signed a bill , now before him , imposing a 2 per cent tax on premium received by the State Insurance Fund . This measure was passed primarily to give private insurers a better chance of competing with the State Fund for Workmen 's Compensation business . Despite the reversal of a cardinal administration policy , the proposed compromise contains some face-saving features for both Governor Dewey and the insurgents . By authorizing virtually ' all the expenditures proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sale of bonds ? instead of tax revenues , the compromise avoids putting Mr. Dewey in the position of recommending spending that the Legislature ' considers wasteful . By making possible a reduction in the tax-increase program proposed by the Governor , it permits the Westchester and Erie groups to claim credit for forcing a halt in the mounting tax burden . Just which projects in the budget would be financed through the sale of bonds instead of from tax revenues if the compromise went through was not clear tonight . But presumably they would be grade-crossing eliminations , parkway or highway construction , since they are the only types of state construction that can be financed by , bonds without a new referendum . By the terms of a proposition approved by the voters in 1926 , the issuance of $300,000 ; 000 in bonds for grade-crossing elimination was authorized . However , only $164 , - 500,000 in bonds were actually sold . Another proposition , recommended by former Governor Lehman and approved in 1941 , authorized the use of $30,000,000 of the grade crossing bond issue for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sold . As of today , the Legislature can authorize , under the provisions of the 1926 referendum as modified by the 1941 vote , a total of $75 , -1 500,000 in bonds for grade crossing elimination , $30,000,000 for highway construction and $30,000 , - ' 000 for parkway construction .
