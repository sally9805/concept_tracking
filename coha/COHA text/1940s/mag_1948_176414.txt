The U.S. was feeling proud of itself on one count-more of its citizens had been getting to college than ever before . But how many stayed the course ? Last week Vice President Archibald Macintosh of <P> Haverford College gave a disturbing answer . He had just completed a survey , Behind the Academic Curtain , * of the 655 liberal-arts colleges throughout the U.S. His findings : of the thousands of students who enter college each year , more than half drop out before graduation . <P> Even to such an experienced college man as Macintosh , the figure was shocking . Most of the students , Macintosh found , dropped out because of academic failure ; and most of those who fell by the wayside did so during the freshman year . <P> Who was to blame ? Partly the students . Because of the " pious sentiment " that everybody should go to college , " a halo has been cast about the word ' college , ' and ... as a consequence there is a blind rush . . . " <P> But for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to blame . Many of them fail to learn enough about their students before admitting them , nor do they pay enough attention to them once they are there . Students need guidance , especially during freshman year . What they find , too often , is a drab and rigid schedule , overcrowded classes , comparatively inexperienced and uninspiring teachers-for " in a curious way a tradition seems to have grown up that it is somewhat beneath the dignity of a full professor to stoop to teach freshmen . " A further discouragement : " In some institutions it is the practice to do a big weeding-out job at the end of the first semester ... If the time spent in building up a case against a new man were spent in trying to find out how to make him work more effectively , all concerned would be considerably better off .
