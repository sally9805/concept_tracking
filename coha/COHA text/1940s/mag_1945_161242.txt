STEEL Maybe . . The West Coast heard some lively news last week : U.S. Steel was ready to dicker with the Defense Plant Corp . to buy or lease the $200,000,000 Geneva steel plant near Provo . Utah . <P> Geneva , now run for the Government by Big Steel , is fondly regarded by Westerners as the best bet to bring them cheap postwar steel , let them grow into their industrial long pants . But until Big Steel broke its toplofty silence , no one was willing to gamble on the prospects of Geneva doing the job . <P> The offer to talk turkey came from Big Steel 's President , Benjamin F. Fairless , as Western steel users prepared to meet this week in Salt Lake City to discuss the postwar fate of Western steel . In letting out the news , Fairless gave them a surprising new item to chew over . Big Steel , he said , is also ready to dicker with DPC to buy or lease the $110,000,000 steel plant at Fontana , Calif. , built and operated by Shipbuilder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass at Fontana made Henry Kaiser roar . Fontana has long been the apple of his eye . He built it in 1942 despite all that the War Production Board could do to stop him , now looks on it as the keystone of a Kaiser postwar empire . Said he : " Fontana is not and will not be for sale . " Kaiser repeated an old promise . He plans to operate Fontana himself after the war , would sink another $37,000,000 into Fontana to convert it to peacetime steelmaking . <P> Henry Kaiser added that furthermore , he and not DPC , owns Fontana , even if the Reconstruction Finance Corp . holds a $110,000,000 mortgage . Although RFC lent him the cash to build the plant , it can not take over unless he stops paying it back . This he does not intend to do . <P> Through a canny deal with RFC , Kaiser now takes the profits from some of his shipyards and applies them on his Fontana loan . If he could not use it this way , most of the money would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He has already paid off $7,500,000 has another $8,000,000 set aside to pay . The balance is still big . But he warned Big Steel that he is in Western steelmaking to stay . As a matter of fact , said Henry Kaiser , his men are now inspecting Geneva . He may buy that , too ; Big Steel has no option on the place . <P> How Much for Geneva ? All this had one good effect . DPC Boss Sam Husbands ' engineers are at work figuring out a price for Geneva . It will probably be well under its cost . Allowance for depreciation and high wartime construction costs may knock off as much as $50,000,000 of the original $200,000,000 . And DPC may also take into account the fact that Geneva is still an expensive place for steelmaking . In the ' first six months last year , it earned only $2,689,386 , with no allowance for depreciation , interest , etc. , which would have put it in the red . <P> Big Steel hopes to do better when all the bugs of the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Geneva can turn out steel as cheaply as Eastern plants , as its backers claim , or whether rail rates will be low enough to let it undersell Eastern mills on the West Coast .
