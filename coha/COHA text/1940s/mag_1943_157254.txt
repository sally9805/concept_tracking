For more than seven months the WLB had put off a decision on an old grievance . Since July , West Coast aircraft workers had been demanding an increase in pay commensurate with shipyard scales . Last week the dispute boiled over in a costly mass demonstration by workers in Seattle 's two big Boeing plants . Work on Flying Fortresses stopped for three hours , was slowed down for longer . <P> Fortress builders left their jobs , surged laughing through Seattle streets , attended a lengthy meeting of Lodge 751 , A.F. of L. International Association of Machinists . To the WLB they delivered an ultimatum : unless the board decided their wage case by Sunday night , the local union would hold continuous mass meetings of off-shift workers . They called on labor in other big West Coast plane plants to do likewise . <P> Next day WLB considered the case , reached no decision . To the union the board replied with an ultimatum of its own : unless workers stayed at their jobs no pay increase would be considered . The U.S. people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congressmen condemned alike WLB indecision , Boeing worker brashness , threatened to revive anti-strike legislation . <P> Leader of the workers ' holiday was rash , 30-year-old Harold J. Gibson ( married , childless , draft classification 26 ) , president of Seattle 's Aero Mechanics ' District Council . At week 's end , A.F. of L. International officers cracked down on Gibson , warned that there must be no further work stoppage . At week 's start the crisis passed . Instead of round-the-clock mass meetings , only a dozen officers of the district governing council sat around a table in Seattle 's old Labor Temple . Loudspeakers in the Boeing plants broadcast union warnings to workers to stay at their jobs . <P> New York Times Columnist Arthur Krock quoted a statement by Corporal H. V. La Rochelle and 13 other wounded soldiers in Walter Reed Hospital : <P> " We who have lain in shell holes watching the skies for bomber and fighter plane help which failed to appear feel pretty bitter about the whole thing . In the Army , acts less treasonable than this are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
