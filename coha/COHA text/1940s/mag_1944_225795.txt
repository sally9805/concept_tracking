Days of Glory ( RKO-Radio ) . Towards the end of Days of Glory , when Nazi tankmen are about to wipe out a band of Russian guerrillas while the guerrillas defend themselves tooth &; nail , the heroine ( Tamara Toumanova ) disconcertingly takes time off . Getting her highly literary words in edgewise between battle noises ( Bang ! Ouch ! ) , she tells the hero ( Zoop ! Gregory Peck ) that she is more than pleased ( ratatatatatat ) to have made ( Bong ! ) his acquaintance . To a similar deafening obbligato , they then repeat the guerrilla oath . <P> Somehow it all seems rather silly . So does the rest of Days of Glory , which is written and produced in the most ardent imitation-Russian manner by R.K.O. 's Casey Robinson . In its course , guerrillas pot Germans in some nice landscapes ; a blonde , experienced in killing , becomes jealous of the city-soft heroine ; a little girl pours scalding water on a Nazi ; a beardless youth , smiling , dies rather than divulge the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any nearer the Russian war than the lobby of an " art " movie theater . Saving graces are two newcomers to films , Broadway 's Gregory Peck , who suggests a Marxian Gary Cooper , and lush-lipped Ballerina Toumanova . <P> Bathing Beauty ( M.G.M. ) plunges streamlined swimming Champion Esther ( " Prettiest Girl in Hollywood " ) Williams into her first starring role . The splash is celebrated in Technicolor , to the music of Harry James and Xavier Cugat . Red Skelton lends the show comedic water wings . A song writer preparing a score for a water pageant , he falls in love with Miss Williams , crashes a girls ' college where she teaches . There , with the help of numerous undergraduate cuties ( notably pert , pint-sized Jean Porter ) , he revolutionizes the music department and , in wrinkled pink tights and a tutu as graceless as the hind elevation of an underprivileged hen , turns a class in eurythmics into the picture 's funniest scene . <P> Miss Williams , a pretty young woman in the pink of condition , should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dry and dressed , she suggests Ginger Rogers .

Her husband ( Gene Kelly ) , a mother-complicated patrician with a weakness for low company , has gone at long last where he can find plenty of it-to jail , as a lifer , for murder . As the flash back ends , he breaks jail , returns to New Orleans to kill Miss Durbin , whom he wrongly assumes is unfaithful to him .
