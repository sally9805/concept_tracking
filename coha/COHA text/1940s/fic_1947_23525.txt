SPARROW 'S LAST JUMP A Story ELLIOTT GRENNARD W E had seen " Specter of the Rose " and the talk got around to Nijinsky and somebody said , " Imagine if they had a camera going when Nijinsky blew his top ! " I wanted to tell them I got Sparrow Jones down on acetate the night he was taken away , but they would have wanted me to play the record for them . They were n't the kind who would say , how can you compare a jazz musician with Nijinsky ? They would have said , I want to own that platter , what a collector 's item ! Telling me ? I guess everyone who read the last jazz Tear-Book and saw how Sparrow rated would want a copy of the last record he made . I could probably sell 20,000 in a month , maybe 50,000 , once word got around . And do n't think I ca n't use that kind of sale . Hot jazz does n't sell the way Freddy Martin or Sammy Kaye does , you know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're doing great . I even played around with the idea of releasing the record and tossing the dough into the pot to pay for Sparrow 's sanitarium . But when a thing like that happens right in front of your eyes ! I do n't want to see it again every time I hear the record . I had just got back from New York that morning , and on the way over to my room I thought I might as well stop in at Jackson 's Jazz Record Shop and see how my disks were going . I release only three records every two months and whenyou 're a little guy in this business , you 're smart if you give it that personal touch . That 's all I 'd been doing for six weeks ; dropping in on record dealers between L. A. and New York , giving them a big , well hel-lo . Jackson is my best customer in Hollywood . He ca n't afford to  --  and does n't want to  --  stock everything he 'd have to if he held Victor , Columbia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not a big business but not a bad one , when you figure there are eighty-nine off-labels on the market and most of them wax nothing but hot jazz . I said , " Hi ya , Jackson , " sneaking a quick look at the walls to see if my stickers were up . " You ai n't real , McNeil ? " he said . Then he asked me what I heard from the mob and I told him the big news in the East was be-bop . I said , I was thinking of getting hold of Sparrow Jones and cutting me some of this be-bop . Jackson bared his teeth in what he thought was a grin . " You clowning , Browning ? There 's a cat spinning your Basin Street album in the booth who 'll run you out of town if I tell him you 're going to wax be-bop . " Jackson was kidding on the square . " New Orleans " collectors are murder . They swear that jazz died in 1924 and anyone who did n't personally rock the cradle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Benny Goodman ? 420 IIARPER 'S MAGAZINE A bed-chamber music clarinetist who could n't shine Jimmy Noone 's shoes . Me , 1 do n't argue . I put my stuff out under three different labels : N'Orleans , Southside , and Hep . That way , nobody gets mad at anybody . I went back to see this character in the booth , and not only because it 's good business . The truth is , I like all kinds of jazz  --  Louis , Duke , Goodman . Even when I do n't exactly like it , or understand it  --  like be-bop  --  I respect what the boys are trying to do . What the hell , how many guys collected the Duke before the middle thirties ? When I open the door of the booth what do I hear but some frantic trumpet that could only be Dizzy Gillespie . Before I can ask myself if I 'm hearing things or what , I see it is no character playing the Gillespie record . It 's big Hughie Hadliffe . Hughie is one of my favorite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went East six weeks back . I yelled , " Hughie ! " and pumped his arm . H uoniz always gives you a solid handshake because that 's the way he is , solid and serious . With his glasses on , Hughie looks like an interne , which is what he would have been if he had n't decided after three years of college that being a Negro doctor is pretty tough going . So instead of breaking his back , Hughie stuck to the trumpet that had been paying his way through school . But he still looked like a medic . No little nanny-goat whiskers for Hughie , even if shaving underthe lip was supposed to hurt your playing . And no dark glasses , either . The only thing screwy about Hughie was that he had gone on a be-bop kick and had chucked up a sweet job with Basic , plus a bookful of recording dates every month . That 's the trouble with be-bop . Once you start hearing those screwy chords in your ear and get those offbeats in your system , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is too straight , too on-the-nose . " How 's my boy ? " I asked . Hughie shook his head . " He 's not doing so good . " I said , " Huh ? " and then I realized he thought I was asking about Sparrow . Jazz musicians have single-track minds . They eat , drink , and sleep their music . They 're so hipped , if somebody comes along with something new , they make him God . That 's the way it was with Hughie and Sparrow . Hughie had heard Sparrow one night . and when Sparrow asked if he 'd like to play with him , Hughie dropped everything . Sparrow was his boy , and the way he saw it , there could be only one boy . " Does n't he like it at the Club ? " I said . " He likes it all right , I guess . " I saw he did n't feel like telling me , but I asked anyway . " What 's the matter ? " Hughie sort of shrugged . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say . Jazz musicians do n't pop off a lot . Like when you ask them about jazz ; they do n't trust words to say what they feel , so they dummy up . If they do n't like something and you ask them , they kind of turn away and say , " Well . You know . " If they like something , they 'll grin and say , " That 's all right . " When they 're really gone on someone , they 'll say , " Man , he plays fine ! " So when Hughie did n't say anything , I knew this business about Sparrow was something big . That changed my plans . " Too bad , " I said . " I wanted you and Sparrow and the band to make some records for me . " Hughie straightened up . " Gee , that would be great , Harry . No kidding , great . Why do n't we do that ? We got some fine numbers . Real fine . " I thought , what goes on here ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it easy , " I said . " You just told me different . " Hughie 's shoulders dropped . I knew he could n't keep up that fast chatter . " Sparrow 's sick , " he said quietly . " I do n't know how long he 's going to hold up . I thought it would be nice if he made some records while he could . " It gave me a stab seeing Hughie like that , but I did n't want to let on . " Forget it , " I said . " I 'll drop in at the Club one of these nights and we 'll talk to Sparrow about a date . " Hughie looked solemn . " If you 're going to record Sparrow , " he said , " you better do it soon . " Then I knew it was bad . Jackson 's got a loose lip , so I tried to duck him on my way out . He popped up from behind the counter just as I was passing . " I forgot to tell you about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wig is really loose . Looks like he 's blowing his top for good . " I purposely misunderstood . " Yeah , I hear he 's playing fine . " " When he can hold his instrument , " Jackson said . " Man , he 's got a tic that makes a Holy Roller look like she 's holding still ! " That meant it was all over the street . I COULD N'T put Sparrow out of my mind . He got this job at the Club about four weeks back , and it should have made him feel good . He 'd been laying off for nearly eight months , and that 's a long time for a guy who 's worked steady since he was fourteen . I decided to look in on him that same night . The Club was a bottle joint on Central and 38th . Not much of a place for a guy who 's played the best locations in the country , but be-bop was too new to have a following and no Los Angeles night club operator with a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white night club . I know these clubs . They do n't get started till one , so I got there a little after two . I took a table next to the bandstand and ordered some setups . The boys were just going on , so while I unwrapped my bottle I watched . When Sparrow sat down in his chair and turned around I nearly caved . He was n't the same Sparrow . It was hard to believe this middle-aged man was only twenty-two years old . His dark skin used to be tight , with a shine to it ; now it set on his bones like black putty . His eyes were big and round and empty , and the expression on his face was just about the saddest expression I 've ever seen . It made you think he wanted to cry inside , only he had tried and found he could n't . I remember when his tight little body used to operate like a precision machine . When he used to get set to play , his eyes would narrow down and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been wound up . And then he went . Anybody who heard him those three years with Joe Pepper 's Hot Five knows how Sparrow could go . He went so fast and so far that the last year he was with them , Joe and the others could n't keep up . That 's when they began calling him " Sparrow . " He was playing just too frantic . Sparrow never could play with a big band ; his tone was too personal , his intonation too full of shadings to blend with other saxophones . That 's why Joe Pepper 's band was good for him . They played blues , and Sparrow kept them from dragging . Then the band played only jump tunes at a medium tempo , and Sparrow really began to jump . That 's when the trouble between him and Joe started . Joe wanted to keep the beat nice and relaxed , but they just could n't hold Sparrow down . He kept pushing the beat harder and harder , driving it ahead . It did n't become faster , it just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that made Joe uneasy . When Sparrow quit the band , he found he had no place to go . He was playing in another world . It was n't until Hughie went with him , and they got Jimmy Brash on piano , Joe Miggs on drums , and Fat Stuff . on bass , that Sparrow had someone he could play with . Sparrow would tear loose until Hughie caught it ; then they were playing together . The other three just about hung on , but it did n't matter . That 's the outfit I had planned to record . Looking at Sparrow sitting there , I did n't think there was a chance . I did n't want to stare at him but I could n't help myself . He was twitching and jerking like a machine gone crazy . It was the worst tic I 'd ever seen . First his head would snap to the right , then to the left . Then maybe four times to the right . Meanwhile his legs would shoot out at cockeyed angles and a shoulder would jerk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or three parts at the same time , but you could n't anticipate any of it . It had no pattern , no rhythm . And all the time his face did n't show it knew what his body was doing . It just looked sad . The band was supposed to be Sparrow 's , but Hughie was taking care of things . He said what tunes they would play , who would take the solos , and they got ready . I looked to see what they were doing about Sparrow , but they acted like he was n't there . Except that when I saw the way their expressionless eyes passed over him , I knew they were thinking plenty about him . It was just one of those things too big for words , or expressions . Hughie beat off on " Oh My , Oh My , " a crazy , hopped-up be-hopper , and Sparrow stopped twitching . Then his head jerked to the right about twenty times , fast , in time with the music . Suddenly his head stopped jerking , his body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step . When he came out of the step , the snap swung his chair clean around while his saxophone flew to his lips  --  and he was blowing with the first beat of the second chorus , right on cue . Only his chair was facing the back of the bandstand and Sparrow was blowing to the empty wall . On the last beat of the phrase , his chair swung around again and Sparrow was blowing to the room . I mean , really blowing . It was the old Sparrow again and the band knew it . They did n't look at him , or smile , but they anew it and the way they played proved it . I must have been holding my breath for thirty seconds . When I let go and sat back in the chair , my body ached as though it had been caught in an ice-crusher . I poured myself a double and tried to relax by concentrating on the music . A lot that helped . y ou know what be-bop 's like ? I do n't mean in musical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to explain it . They do n't even call it " be-bop . " They just say it 's " frantic , " and maybe that 's the best way of describing it when you consider that the dictionary says frantic means : " violently mad or distracted ; outrageous ; transported by passion . " Personally , I do n't go that far . I think of be-bop as : " tense , agitated ; controlled hysteria . " Sparrow and Hughie had worked out some unison choruses your ear could n't follow , and when they finished the set , the other three boys were smiling . I could just hear them saying , " Man , that was fine . Real fine . " Hughie joined me for a drink but Sparrow stayed in his chair . He did n't do anything or look at anything . He just sat there like he was asleep , only he had his eyes open . Hughie and I drank without talking . Our eyes did n't let go of Sparrow . " What goes ? " I asked finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I hesitated . " Or taking anything ? " I could see Hughie making up his mind to tell me . " He 's been on morphine lately . " I said , " Oh . " Hughie did n't want to leave it at that . " Sparrow used to take a drink like anyone else , but that last year with Joe Pepper he was beginning to play frantic and he was afraid he could n't keep up with it . He started drinking heavy , then he began on reefers . When it did n't give him what he was looking for , he tried morphine . " Hughie shook his head sadly . " I 've tried to tell him that stuff never helped anybody 's music . " The old story . I knew how most of the old-timers got started taking things . They 'd play some cheap caf ? from seven till unconscious , then have to be at a recording studio at nine in the morning . They 'd smoke a weed and get a lift from it , then think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out different , but the kids that followed had to learn it for themselves , the hard way . It made me sore . " How good did he think he could get , for Christ sakes ! He 's only twenty-two , and there are n't three guys on his instrument who can touch him right now ! " " Sparrow 's like that . He 's always fussing about his playing , thinking up new ideas , new ways of using his horn . " Hughie looked at me , wondering if I 'd understand . " Sparrow worries . He meets strange people and they tell him he 's a genius , and he feels like a fool not knowing what to say back to them . He never went past the eighth grade , and how much chance has a Neg ? " Hughie changed it . " How much chance has Sparrow had to mix and learn about things ? He 's got a feeling all he knows is how to play . That 's why he works so hard on it ; it 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 'm shooting my mouth off . 1 , Vhat do I know how it 's like for a colored guy in a white world , even a guy with Sparrow 's talent ? He meets other musicians and that 's all right ; with them it 's the way you play your instrument that counts . But the others . The ones who discover jazz and collect records and think that makes it all right for them to go scouting for Negro musicians like on a scavenger hunt . Or the magazine writers looking for stories they can sell , talking so palsy-walsy and making the guy they 're interviewing feel like he 's something that crawled out from the woodwork . Or the drunk at the bar who thinks it 's okay to throw his arm around a colored musician and say , " Why do n't you and me go out tonight and get us some high yaller gals ? " And Sparrow felt it was up to him ; that he had to justify their interest in him . For that he was playing his heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about when I saw somebody I had n't noticed before , sitting at the drums behind Sparrow . He was swishing the wire brushes on the snare drum , and while he was n't looking right at Sparrow , I got the feeling he was watching him all the time . " Who 's that ? " I asked Hughie , pointing with my chin . " That 's Cappy . Sparrow 's band boy . " He looked about thirty-five , kind of old to be a band boy . I grinned . " This job must pay better than I thought . " " Cappy does n't take anything from Sparrow , " Hughie said . " He just wants to be around him . " I know how jazz fans worship great musicians . " Sparrow his boy ? " Hughie smiled . " That 's his boy . " We watched Cappy for a while . He had ' a nice smile . He kept a soft rhythm going with the brushes , as if he were caressing Sparrow 's back with it . It seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making some records and the more I thought about it , the more I felt the way Hughie did . " How about a recording date ? " I said after a couple of minutes . " Think Sparrow would be able to make it ? " Hughie got eager again . " He was fine this last set . " I thought , what the hell . " Tomorrow ? I 'll get the Sunset Studio for seven , so we can eat first . " " . Tomorrow 'd be fine . " " Want me to talk to Sparrow ? " " I 'll tell him , " Hughie said . H E STOOD UP and the other boys got up from where they had been sitting . Cappy did n't stop swishing those brushes until Joe Miggs took over the drums . When Cappy passed Sparrow , he made it a point to run his hand accidentally across Sparrow 's shoulders . He waited near Sparrow until the boys started the first number , then he stepped back . He smiled an apology when he saw he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Have a drink ? " I asked . He said all right , and he pulled out a chair so it faced the bandstand . He took his eyes off Sparrow when I reached for my bottle . " Make mine plain coke , " he said in a nice easy way . I said sure , and I signaled the waiter . " You play drums ? " I asked when we had both taken a drink . " Uh-uh . I used to play tenor . " " No more ? " " I ai n't played in four years , " he said in that easy way of his . I looked at him , wondering . " Maybe you remember me , " he said . " Cappy Graystone ? " Then I remembered . " Sure . You were with Webster when he had his big band . And before that , the Rhythm Riders . " Cappy smiled . " You remember . That 's nice . " I started to say , " Why 'd you stop playing ? " when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't seem to mind . " I was sick , " he said . " Like Sparrow . " I steered away from that . " He sure plays that horn , " I said . " Nobody plays like Sparrow , " Cappy said . Then he grinned , shyly . " I started him . " I said , " No kidding . " Cappy liked that . " Yeah , I started him . I taught him his first piece . Thirteen years ago . He was nine , and I was playing my first big job . The old Paradise Ballroom . " , The band had finished the opening number of the set and was started on the next . Cappy 's eyes opened wide . " That 's it ! That 's the piece I was telling you . " I listened to Jimmy Brash playing a piano intro , and what surprised me was how slow he was playing it . Be-bop bands hardly ever play anything slow , Then I recognized the tune . It was " Sweet Sue , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sparrow came in on the up-beat and Cappy 's smile reached from ear to ear . " Can you beat that man ? " he said . " He 's playing it for Cappy . He knew I was bragging on him . " I peered at Sparrow but his face had the same dead-pan expression . He did n't know we were alive , let alone talking about him . Then , just when I decided it was all a coincidence , Sparrow 's face twitched like he was winking and he honked five notes of the melody right at Cappy . Cappy went crazy . " I hear you talkin ' ! " he yelled back . " Play it for Cappy , boy ! Play it for Cappy ! " Sparrow proceeded to do things to Sue she never would have believed possible . The table could n't hold Cappy after that . He had to get up close where he could almost touch the sad-looking boy with the saxophone . The next number was a fast one again , and right in the middle of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over his head , like someone had pulled a string on it . I thought he was clowning for Cappy but I changed my mind fast . Sparrow could n't bring the instrument down . He kept playing it in that position until Hughie brought the number to an abrupt end . The boys on the stand shot Hughie a quick look and he motioned , that 's all , to them . They walked off the stand and Cappy pried the instrument out of Sparrow 's hands . It was too much for me . I threw some bills on the table and beat it out of there , At six , I gave up trying to fall asleep . I phoned Hughie , figuring he 'd be home by then . Hughie answered the phone himself . " How is he ? " I asked . " Cappy took him home right after you left . " , " Jesus , " I said . " Is that the way he 's been ? " " Last night was the worst . " " Look , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go through with that date ? Put him through the wringer for a lousy couple of records ? " " It might be the last time for a while . " I cursed . " Shall I go get him tonight ? " I asked . " Cappy 'll bring him . " I said okay , and banged the phone down in its cradle . I WONDERED how smart I was , letting myself in for this . Counting the band , the studio , engineers , and incidentals , my recording sessions set me back a thousand bucks apiece . An awful lot of dough . I cut four tunes on each date and I can generally figure on them selling enough to get me back my costs . But unless one of the four sides turns out to be a real seller , I 'm in the hole . You ca n't stay in business just making back your costs . If Sparrow showed up in the condition I saw him last , / 'd be lucky if I got back the price of a pack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the studio and by the time the boys arrived , the bottle was a little less than half full . When I saw Sparrow I stopped worrying , he looked so much better . He still had that dead-pan look but he was n't twitching . I said hello , but I guess he did n't hear me. / did n't know what else to say , so I handed him the bottle . He held it for a while without looking at it , then he took a swig . He made a mouth like it was Clorox . It did n't look like he wanted more , so I took the bottle from him and handed it around . Everybody but Cappy took a good slug . Then Hughie got busy laying ' out the tunes . Sparrow sat quietly where Cappy put him , puffing a cigarette Cappy put in his mouth . I thought it was going to be all right , but I felt fidgety . I clomped around the big studio , avoiding the group around the piano and drums . Then I looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were staring , with the same sad expression I remembered from the night before . It began to get me . I told Hughie we 'd cut everything and I went back into the mixer 's glass booth . I watched them through the glass window . Cappy handed Sparrow his instrument and I saw the boys waiting for him to tune up . When Sparrow did n't make any motions , I looked at Hughie . He did n't look at me . " Let 's go , " I said to the mixer . " It 's a take . " The mixer looked at me like I was crazy . " Are n't they going to warm up ? " I did n't answer , so he switched into the engineer and told him it was a take . Then he switched into the studio and told the boys to watch the lights . The white light would go on first , then the red . The red meant play . That 's so you can time the number and get your three minutes . Hughie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the window where I sat . Sparrow put his instrument in his mouth and stood up at the mike . They waited for the lights . The white light went on . That meant ten seconds more . It seemed like a year . Then the red light flashed on . Hughie beat off with a nod of his head and they swung into " Wing Ding . " It was no good . " Wing Ding " has a tricky opening where the sax and trumpet play against each other , accenting different beats . It 's got to be right or it sounds like a clambake . Sparrow came in a beat late , fouling it up . The mixer switched into the studio and told them to try it again . Then he switched over to the engineer 's room , telling him to smear it and get ready for another take . The white light went on again , then the red . This time Sparrow came in a beat too soon . The third time he was late again . We tried it twice more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The boys looked embarrassed . Cappy came over to the booth and yelled through the glass window . We would have heard him anyway , the mike was on . " It 's those lights , " Cappy pleaded . " They make him tight . He 'll play good when he 's relaxed . It 's those lights . " I pulled the switch and called in to Hughie that we 'd try another tune without lights . " Whenever you 're ready , tell me. ! ! C APPY put Sparrow back on his chair and lit another cigarette for him . The others stood around for a while , not doing anything . Then Jimmy Brash started playing something on the piano , just anything . The bass and drums picked it up , and Hughie started noodling . After a minute , Sparrow joined in from his chair , nice and easy . Then Sparrow began to blow hard and the music jumped . They jammed choruses for five minutes before Hughie waved it to a close . He looked at Sparrow . " How about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He did n't wait for an answer . " No lights this time , Sparrow . You start and we 'll come in . Let 's make this something . Sparrow . Okay ? " Sparrow blinked and it shocked me . I had n't realized his eyes had been staring wide open all the time . He stood up , pushing the chair away with the back of his legs , and he stepped up to the mike . His body was tense the way it used to get years ago when he was ready to play . Nobody moved . Then I poked the mixer and he called in , " Ready for a take , " to the engineer . " The Sparrow Jumps " is a showcase piece ; no arrangements , nothing . Just Sparrow soloing , with Hughie and the piano playing figures behind him . Sparrow tore off the opening cadenza at a tempo that brought the boys ' heads up . They were used to playing the " Jump " at a good clip , but this was , what I mean ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I crossed my fingers . Then I uncrossed them . The band was playing like it never played before and Sparrow was going like a bat out of hell . But it was more than that , it had an excitement that gave me goose pimples ; the kind of excitement that hallmarks all the really great records and still comes through long after the wax has worn thin and what you hear is only an inkling of what was . I thought , man oh man . The hell with whether I get my four sides . This one 's enough . This is for the books . When this hits the record stores The music seemed to be getting faster and I looked to see what the hell Joe Miggs was thinking about on his drums . The time is always the same in jazz . If it starts slow , it stays slow . If it starts fast , it stays that way , it does n't get faster . Only this was . Then I saw Jimmy Brash 's face had a funny look . His fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my ears caught it . It was the chords . They were n't jibing with what Sparrow was playing . Sparrow was changing keys , sometimes in the middle of a phrase . The bass player had the same worried look . They had been playing together long enough to follow any of Sparrow 's changes , but he was getting away from them . Only Hughie could n't be shaken off . He managed to hang on , and how he did it I 'll never know . I guess only a guy who Felt about Sparrow the way Hughie did , could . It was the most frantic , wonderful , exciting music I had ever heard . Sparrow 's tic had returned but I did n't catch it right away ; I 'd watched too many jazz musicians swing their shoulders and shimmy their knees while they played . Even when I knew the tic was there , I could n't always follow it . Sparrow 's head would jerk to one side and notes from his horn would catch the swing back , making the jerk part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his body twitched or his legs kicked out . Music caught the spasm at the point it broke off , completing it . It was as if the jerks and twitches were musical sounds Sparrow could hear . That 's what made it different from the night before . This had pattern , rhythm ; it was so all of a piece you could n't tell whether you were seeing it or hearing it . T HEN you could n't miss it . His whole body began to twitch crazily , and what he played was crazy in exactly the same way . It had to be , if his jerks and twitches were notes Sparrow could hear . And that 's the way he was hearing it . The other boys kept playing , but they were watching him the way I was . I thought I was losing my mind . I do n't know how long I watched it before I got hold of myself . I pressed down on the switch , yelling , " Stop it ! Stop it ! Stop it ! Stop it ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of trickling away , their eyes still on Sparrow . He was still going , his twisted music and his tortured body allmixed up in one long insane convulsion . I stumbled out of the booth and grabbed him . I held him tight until the notes from his horn finally petered out . I could feel his tremors in my fingertips . I eased him onto a chair , still holding him . The other boys were looking at me , like they were expecting me to do something . I did n't know what to do : I only knew we could n't leave him in whatever crazy world he was inhabiting . We had to bring him back , give him something he could tie onto , something familiar , something rational . I looked for Cappy . He was standing right behind me , but I saw his face and I knew it was up to me . " Jimmy ! ' Sweet Sue ' ' ' I snapped my fingers at the piano player . " Play it , for Christ sakes ! " Jimmy began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held Sparrow 's shoulders so they could n't move . I spoke right into his face . " I want you to play this for Cappy ! You hear ? " I thought , I 've got to get through to him , I 've got to , " Play this for Cappy . For Cappy . " I felt Sparrow shiver . Then he looked up slowly . I saw meaning come into his empty eyes . His mouth opened , closed , then opened again , and he whispered , " Cappy ? " / was screaming inside but I kept my voice quiet . " Yes , Sparrow . Cappy . " I bent closer . " He wants to hear you play . Will you play this for him , Sparrow ? For Cappy ? " I could see him struggling with the idea , then he nodded solemnly , like a little boy saying , " Yes , sir . " He wet his lips , fixed his mouth around his instrument , and his toe tapped out a careful 1-2-3-4 . Then Sparrow played " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighbor 's kid sounds when he 's practicing his new lesson , squeaky and screechy but earnest  --  so damned earnest ? That 's how Sparrow sounded when he played " Sweet Sue . " Exactly as it must have sounded that first time , thirteen years ago . I left Cappy crying like a baby , and I headed for the nearest bar . Yeah , Sparrow 's last recording would sure make a collector 's item . One buck , plus tax , is cheap enough for a record of a guy going nuts .
