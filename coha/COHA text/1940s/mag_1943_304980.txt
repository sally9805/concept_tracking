A " Tail-End Charley " ( last plane of a flight ) caught this picture of flaming Ploesti during the U.S. raid on the Rumanian oil center which supplies vital fuel to Germany ( TIME , Aug. 9 ) . Delayed-action bombs had not yet exploded when the camera clicked , but incendiaries had started a network of fires . The U.S. Liberators dropped 300 tons of high explosive and thousands of incendiaries from as low as 100 ft . Planes flew through sheets of flame , emerged covered with soot , while gunners dueled with rooftop anti-aircraft and saw people waving from the streets . Losses were high - but so was the damage : five of the biggest refineries of Ploesti ' s 13 were badly damaged , a sixth destroyed .
