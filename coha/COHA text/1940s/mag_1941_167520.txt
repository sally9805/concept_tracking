Under a hazy summer sun that lay warm on the Quadrangles and the green Midway , 500 of the world 's great scholars met last week to celebrate the 50th birthday of one of the western world 's youngest and most vigorous great universities . The University of Chicago could hardly match the ancient names and traditions of learning represented by its guests from Cambridge , Oxford , Aberdeen , Glasgow , Dublin , Edinburgh . But the delegates had come to honor not age but youth . At lusty Chicago they found the civilized spirit still green and hopeful . <P> " The members of the Chicago faculty , " President Robert Maynard Hutchins told his guests , " breathe the freest air on this continent . " At the freest university on the freest continent , delegates addressed themselves to freedom 's future . <P> Chicago had pitched its celebration on a deliberately optimistic note-but not without grave philosophical headshakings . It gathered scores of eminent scholars to report their explorations ( see pp. 68 &; 73 ) on the frontiers of science and philosophy - frontiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professor of economic history at the University of London , flew to the meeting by Clipper and plane . From the University of Buenos Aires came Philologist Amada Alonso ; from the Catholic Institute of Paris , famed Philosopher Jacques Maritain . In the gathering were 150 college and university presidents . A symposium on the place of ethics in the modern world drew the biggest crowd . In the murk of Gothic Mandel Hall , 2,000 heard totalitarianism doomed by Professors Maritain , Tawney and Charles H. Mcllwain ( Harvard ) and President Hutchins . Although the learned gen tlemen , like lesser citizens , disagreed on the issue of war and peace they all agreed on the evils of totalitarianism . <P> But more inspiring to the delegates than the learned symposia was the fabulous history of the University of Chicago itself-a story of three men : William Rainey Harper , John D. Rockefeller and Robert Hutchins . Like the university he founded , Harper was a prodigy . Born in an Ohio log cabin , he read the Bible at three , graduated from Muskingum College at 13 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ph.D . at Yale at 18 , was a full professor at 20 . Harper made the study of Hebrew , theretofore deader than Sanskrit , a national fad . He started Hebrew summer classes , institutes , correspondence courses , soon had so much mail that the local postmaster 's salary had to be raised . Eventually Yale nabbed him ; it took Yale 's largest lecture hall to hold his students ; he had more mail than the university itself . They called him " a steam engine in pants . " <P> Baptist John D. Rockefeller sought out Baptist Harper , offered him the presidency of a new Baptist college , on which he was prepared to spend $10,000,000 . But Harper , who knew exactly what he wanted , held out for three years until Rockefeller agreed to start not a college but a university . Harper became Chicago 's founder and president at 34.
