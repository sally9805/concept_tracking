The Artist A Story by Ralph Kaplan illustrated by Taro Yashima T HE El was passing , rushing with its fearful , clattering grind , making the old building tremble , raising the dust from the black , splintery floor and shivering delicately the broad , grimy panes of the row of large windows at the front of the loft , and when the rear door opened they did not hear it . Besides , they had fallen into the thoughtful , musing tiredness that came toward evening , working automatically , hands moving as if of their own volition and thoughts elsewhere ; thinking about going home , of eating , of changing and getting out of the house ; of small pleasures carefully , preciously conceived and tenuously drawn out , re-played in endless variations , dreaming ; and when the figure came out of the darkness of the rear of the loft and into the light around the bench they were startled . A young man stood nodding and looking from one to the other of the three people around the bench , Ruben at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work across from him , smiling at them with an open , friendly regard , modest but seemly and yet grave , without diffidence . " I 'm looking for Mr. Finkel , " he said , smiling as at a rare , quiet joke . He looked at Alberta , but she turned her head sharply , avoiding his gaze , strangely confused , a large , handsome young colored woman in her early thirties . She had been humming to herself her favorite tune , " I 'll be rich as Rocky-feller , " and when she looked up and saw him it startled her half to death , and then the reflective , friendly , and confiding look that he fastened on her disconcerted her oddly and she took to working furiously , her fingers shuttling swiftly . " is n't this Mr. Finkel 's place ? Is he here ? " " He 's upstairs , " Clara spoke up , staring at him with open curiosity and her usual tentative belligerence , a young Italian girl , extremely stout , affecting a defensive brusqueness . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you . He 'll be down soon , bud ; he 's just chewin ' the rag ... " " Thank you . It 's all right , " he said , waving a deprecatory hand . " I 'll wait . " He went to the window and stood looking out and they watched him with a mild , furtive interest . He was small-looking with an insubstantial leanness , the head looking large for the slightness of him ; hatless , the dark hair curling over his neck , giving it a soiled look ; and he had his shirt open at the throat and folded over the collar of his jacket , although there was a touch of winter in the air outside , weather for an overcoat ; and when he turned from the window with a smiling , depthless good nature , Ruben thought he recognized the faint , sad droop and aquilinity , and the subtle , imponderable stamp around the eyes and mouth , and felt a strange , sharp pang , seeing the eyes and lips foolish , sad , and guileless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they knew it . " Is n't it lovely ? " he said , turning with a confident friendliness , smiling into their wary faces , looking from one to the other . He gestured toward the window . " It 's so very lovely . " When he moved his hand , talking , there was evident a style and gentility unfamiliar to the loft , a graceless , mean , and vulgar place . They stared at him blankly . " The sky , " he said . ' T urns an evening in late autumn , the dark-ness falling early . A large neon sign on the roof across the street sprang garishly alight against the deepening sky , the intensely luminous blue found often in the evenings of 1 that time of year . Ruben looked out and thought with a sharp quickening that winter was coming , reminded of it suddenly and resentfully ; each year it came to him with a faint , unpleasant shock and he always faced it numbly , like the prospect of decay or dissolu. tion ; it marked for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He felt with an acute realism a cold , squeamish wetness on the soles of -I his feet , curling them , like slush through thin soles , and thought that he would be no better prepared for this winter than he had for the last . He had not wanted to think about it . i " It is beautiful , is n't it ? " the guy was saying , turning to Clara the mild , sad gaze of his eyes , large and gray with the dark curling 0 lashes of a girl , and she melted a bit before them , arching her brows . " So lovely , a beautiful , subtle shade ; but cold and sad , like a beautiful dead girl ; does n't it make you sad ? " They looked at him and thought that his eyes , wide and grave , had in them a sad completion , a bitter certainty or wisdom or knowledge , but then the voice betrayed the inane assumptive lack of self-awareness of the child or fool . He misread the little smiles that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complicity , friendliness . Ruben felt the pang wrench upward in him , turning and sinking like a sodden log , familiar and sad , and felt an unreasonable flush , of resentment and embarrassment . Clara stared at him with her large black eyes wide in her blandly humorous fat face . " Me , " she said , " makes me wan na go home an ' eat my little supper . " He smiled at her delightedly . " You know , " he said , -I can grasp it , the beauty of it , I can feel it , because , you see , I happen to be an artist . " He ducked his head and shrugged one shoulder with a sad , smiling humility and a certain proper pride , looking happily into their faces as if to share a good fortune , offering to the world to partake in it , not shutting anyone out . Alberta looked over at Ruben , trying to catch his eye , her hands , looking a dusty tan under the droplight , moving with a deceptive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he smiled to her , nodding , she ducked her head into her hunched shoulders and turned her eyes to the corners as if trying to see him without herself being seen , letting her mouth fall open , her face trembling on laughter . Alberta was working beside Clara and Ruben was across from them , soldering connections . The bench was more properly a long table , extending down the center of the loft at right angles to the front windows , made crudely of boards and covered with cheap oilcloth , strewn with small piles of ceramic insulators , little bolts and nuts and washers , condensers to be soldered into a cheap gadget which sold in the five-and-ten and was supposed to eliminate static in radios but did n't ; and they worked from these , hands striking out swiftly and consecutively for one thing after another , putting them together , discarding them , fast and purposeful , with a precipitate and desperate quickness and with no waste of motion ; even when they talked the words seemed to fall timed between the movements , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were on piecework . " Do you paint pictures or what ? Do you make statues ? " Clara inquired innocently . " Draw my picture ? " " I 'm not a finished artist , of course , " he said , as if momentarily interrupted in a pleasant discourse , constrained by politeness to continue it . " But I 'm only a young man yet , although people take me for much older ; probably because I have a serious outlook . I 'm only twenty-two . How old did you take me for ? I imagine you took me for much older ? " " Oh , " Clara said , pursing her lips with deliberation , " I figured . .. oh , twenty-two . " " Really ? " He looked at her pleasantly , his face open and sad and confiding . " People take me for much older . You know , you might say I was a student . I study art , I instruct myself ; I go to the museums and study the great artists . Sometimes I stand there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us say , and I feel like crying , or like singing ; something like a music goes through me . It happens sometimes too when I set a clean new sheet before me , perfectly clean , white , like snow ; it makes me want to cry ; I look at the whiteness , clean and perfect , and I want to cry or sing . I feel music , and I think of all the wonderful wonderful things I could put down and it fills me up so tight I think I 'm going to bust . I study life , too . 1 observe and look at things . " " That must be interesting as hell , " Clara exclaimed . " Oh , it is . " He pulled a stool over and sat beside her . Ruben shook his head to Alberta , thinking , the poor , poor dopey bastard , oh the poor fool . " You know , " the fellow was saying , " you have a very nice face . " Clara glared at him warily , laughing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , complimented woman , preening , her cheeks reddening . She was not unhandsome , with large dark eyes and the small facile features of a slyly humorous little girl . Her arms and upper body were heavy , but it was only from the waist down that she attained her full proportions , with inverted pyramids of legs swelling up from the burdened creased ankles to great thighs and the full , round , dimpled , magnificent buttocks of a draught horse . " You have a pleasant and attractive face . I find stout people are usually very pleasant . " " What the hell , " she said and gave him a perplexed and bitter look . She grew red and said briskly , " Now look , do n't be wise . Nobody asked for any wise remarks . " Alberta could not contain her laughter , whooping , and Ruben grinned . - Do n't be smart , " Clara said , but the artist smiled at her with a mild and utter innocence , only the least bit puzzled , looking over at Alberta to share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Alberta said to herself , laughing and shaking her head , letting her big-boned shoulders tremble softly with laughter , eyebrows raised and eyes peeking from the corners toward the artist , as if afraid of unexpected developments , putting her head down and laughing , the light catching her coppery , brown skin and vaselined , straight black hair . T HE two shaded droplights over the table were the only ones on in the shop except for the small red exit bulb over the door all the way in the back of the shop , and only the immediate vicinity of the table was lighted , a little island in the pitch blackness . There was another large work bench against the wall and toward the rear of the loft a clutter of sewing machines and a cutting table , all covered over ; it was rather slow , the work Finkel had had for the sewing machines had petered out  --  some sort of cheap novelty bags THE of imitation leather  --  and now there was only a dribble of work from the people Finkel contracted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very bad , as bad as they were going to get : Chatham Square and the acijacent streets were full of men standing around with paper in their shoes , sitting on the curb with their heads in their hands , standing in doorways and passing fifteen-cent bottles of diluted wood alcohol from hand to hand . Times had been bad so long it seemed they had never been otherwise , and would remain that way forever . The sky had darkened to a very deep blue , but still with a vibrant , luminous quality . Lights sprang up in the buildings across the street and on the bridge approach just past the next intersection , and the neon sign shone in ghastly alternating red and blue through the windows . The El trains that rushed by every few minutes bearing crowds home from work made a terrible , intolerable clamor in the narrowness between the buildings , made the windows tremble , jostled their brains , and they would stop speaking , waiting numbly , closing their minds and tensing themselves as if against an assault . " On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ softly . " What are you , a comedian ? " Clara said bitterly . " What ? " the artist said . " What do you mean ? I 'm sorry if I offended you . " " Ah , go stick your head in a hole . " Oh , nuts , she said to herself , and her mouth pouted up and she felt like crying . Here she 'd been starting to think almost that he was nice , he had such nice eyes , even if he was a fool . He sat with his chin on the palm of his hand , watching her work as if fascinated , looking at her with a smiling good nature , the trustfulness of one who knows he can not arouse other than friendly or generous impulses . They heard the elevator door open and Finkel 's quick , birdlike steps . He stopped when he saw the artist arid came blinking into the light , cocking his head . His skin was dark and jaundiced , tight on a bony skull , and he narrowed his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like berries . " Hello ? What is it ? What can I do for you ? " He did not like intruders or visitors , did not even have his name on the board downstairs . The artist rose with a cursory dignified nod . " How do you do ? Mr. Gorelnik , my uncle , said you had some work for me . " Finkel pursed his thin purple lips and rubbed the flat of his palm against his thinning , gray hair , stiff and wiry , and somehow like the man , slyly stubborn , impervious to discouragement , and though without real assurance , the blind impulsion of a grub , having a certain servile nerviness when he needed it . He looked away , thinking , the little eyes receded and speculative . " How is it you are here so late ? " he demanded suddenly , turning on him . " Late ? " the fellow said . " Late , yes ; soon time to go home . " He was getting a little short with him , suspecting sarcasm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leaving the fellow standing there and making of the little fixed smile and slight , ingratiating figure an awkward and importunate thing . " I did n't imagine you needed me very urgently ; I did n't expect you 'd want me to go to work today . " " Need you ? " Finkel said , shrugging airly . " No need . Do you want to work ? I have , yes , a little work. , But not for lazy people , not for fooling around . " " Oh , yes , I would like to , I need to work . I 'd like to make some money . It 's for my mother , mainly . I should be devoting my time to art , since , you see , I 'm an artist . Still , one needs money even for that , and besides my mother would like me to work , and could use the money . I intended to be here earlier . you know , but I walked across the bridge and it 's really much farther across than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while . I watched the boats passing and made some sketches . A man stopped and watched me and then he spoke to me and said he had some knowledge of art and that I showed great talent , that it was all a matter of hard work , of application ( which is true , do n't you think ? ) and he said he had wasted a talent himself , that he would have been an artist but had taken to drink . He asked me for a nickel for a cup of coffee but I said I was sorry  --  and I really was : be was a very nice man . " " There 's a bus running across the bridge . " " Oh ? " the artist said ; " yes , " looking away vaguely . R UBEN shook his head , writhing faintly with a curdling distress and embarrassment . " Sure , and they got fare boxes on them too . Why do n't you leave the poor fool alone , you old bastard ? " he muttered to himself with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was something about the guy that asked to be hurt . " Here , " the artist said , and pulled out of the pocket of his jacket a pad , " would you like to see some of the sketches I made on the bridge ? " Finkel took it in his hand and held it toward the light and stared at it for a moment without expression . " Here , " the fellow said , and turned a page . " This is nothing . I have so very much to learn , about color , for instance , light ; there are so many things to know . I 'd like to paint people . People are so wonderful , so interesting . Look what Rembrandt did with the human face " ? he tossed his head and smiled with a modest , sad irony . " I 'd like to paint my mother . " Finkel had got the bored , distant , and sullen look that came when things got away from him , eluded or puzzled him . " Look , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be here at eight o'clock tomorrow , in the morning , that is , not the evening , if it 's not too much trouble . Take the bus , stops only a few minutes from here . Or maybe you would like better to look at the boats ? " " I 'll be here . I would have been here earlier , but it took me much longer than I thought and I stayed on the bridge a while . There is a beautiful view , a fine perspective , it was something interesting and useful to me as an artist : you have to observe things , you know . Then , when I got off the bridge I asked a man the way but he could n't speak very good English  --  he was Chinese , I believe  --  and he sent me in the wrong direction . Then I asked another man , but he was drunk or sick maybe , sitting on the curb , and he used some terrible language , and said I should beat it . I walked around a while , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I lost track of time . I 'll be here tomorrow on time , though . Now that I know I 've got the job I 'll take the bus over . " " I 'm very happy . Eight o'clock tomorrow morning , then ? All right , now you can go home , you can draw all the pictures you want ; we 'll see you tomorrow . Good night . " " Oh ? Oh , yes . " He stood for a moment , turning from one to the other and smiling . " Good night . " They watched him go out the back door . " Do n't fall down the stairs , " Clara called loudly . Finkel looked at them quizzically. shrug-ring . " An artist , " he said , and made a long impressed face , blowing his breath out , " oowhah ! " Actually he was more than a little impressed that an artist , even a fool , should come to work for him . " He showed me something , but the truth : I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even photographs . I look at them , but they make no meaning to me . " " He gon ' draw Clah 's pitcher , " Alberta said . " He like Clah . IIe say stout people is very nice , pleasant . " " Oo-whah ! " " Awright , " Clara piped . " That 's enough . " " Such a match I would pay money to see . " " Are you starting ? Are you gon na start that , too ? " She took her apron off . " I 'm goin ' home , if you start that stuff . Buncha comedians . " " Go home , go home ; it 's time to go home anyway , almost . Go home , enough for today ; you can get rich tomorrow . " " Rich , shoot , " Alberta said . T HEY washed at the encrusted black sink in the back and the girls changed in the ladies ' rest room , a makeshift of plasterboard which Finkel had put up himself because of the labor regulations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broom handle , an empty medicine cabinet and a canvas cot , provided by regulation in the event that some young woman become indisposed , and on which Finkel took a regular nap every day after lunch . The girls emerged transformed in their street clothes and with lipstick and powder on their faces , Alberta strutting on high heels , stockings hastily straightened on her trim legs , horsing around at the elevator door with the exuberance and release that came always when it was time to go home , even Clara forgetting she was angry to tease shy Ruben and provoke irascible , white-haired old Charlie , the elevator man , going home , leaving the grimy loft to the darkness and the great prowling rats . When Ruben came in the next morning , Finkel had the fellow at work on the riveting machine , standing behind him , watching him ; the machine bulked large and rather impressive among the cheap or second-hand appurtenances of the shop : Finkel rented it but was rather awed by it , proud and careful , thought it lent a dignity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched the artist carefully , looking over his shoulder as he riveted metal clips to small rectangles of bakelite . It required only fitting the hole in the bakelite over the pin in the post which projected like the lower jaw of a fossil horse , placing a fibre and the metal clip on the pin in turn , and simply pressing the footpedal . This tripped a cam , meshing the gears rattling in the head and bringing the hammer crashing down with the rivet . The object to be riveted was held by the edges and there was enough clearance between the hammer and the fingers ; you would n't get hurt unless you did n't watch what you were doing , or messed up on your timing . nervous or working too fast . The artist looked at each piece carefully before putting it on and then glanced at Finkel before pressing the pedal . Finkel would nod impatiently and stood behind him scratching himself and shaking his head . Once he stepped on the pedal too lightly with an anxious tentative toe and the rivet came down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the pedal and the machine repeated , splitting the bakelite piece and almost nicking his finger . " No , no , you 'll break the pin like that . Here " ? he pushed the artist 's hands clear and reached his own foot to press the pedal , wasting a rivet . ' ' There . It 's nothing to it . " He watched him do it , once , twice . " See , you have it , " he said , but he shook his head to Ruben . He kept looking over all morning , watching the studied , careful progression , the artist turning each piece over in his hands and putting his foot down like someone about to trample a scorpion barefooted . Once he stopped altogether and started counting . Alberta threw her hands up , laughing silently . This white boy was crazier than hell . " What are you doing , " Finkel groaned . " First make some , then count . " It was too tiring to work all day standing and Finkel had improvised a seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with burlap . It was not the most comfortable thing in the world to sit on and the artist kept squirming . raising and shifting from one side to the other . The machine made a great din , the ratchet clattering on the gears , the head smashing down . Lunch time , Finkel came over and shut the machine off . The artist got off the seat carefully , like a man dismounting , flexing himself . Finkel peered into the corrugated carton into which the riveted pieces were thrown . " Oo-whah ! " he said softly . The bottom of the box was barely covered . Ruben was washing up at the sink when Finkel came up behind him . " Well , what do you think of this buffoon ? " he said , speaking Jewish . Ruben shrugged , lathering the grime from his hands in the cold water . He would try usually to avoid conversation with Finkel , feeling a certain propriety which proscribed friendliness with the man , his boss , and never having liked him . Finkel was standing close , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found intolerable , the voice emerging from the loose denture with a whistling stale sibilance , the aging , weathered , lean flesh of his ribs pressing against Ruben 's elbow . " The mother I once knew . An attractive woman , a clever girl , proud and delicate . Now , not to be recognized , a widow , middle-aged , desperately poor , like a stone in the fields , nothing ; MAGAZINE husband dead and buried with the consumption ; and with a son like this . What an odd world , eh ? The uncle I know slightly , met me on the street and asked me to take the poor fool on . But this is no ordinary one ; you have to search diligently for fools like this . " " You do n't have to be very bright to work here , " Ruben muttered sullenly and unhappily , flushing . " True , true . " Finkel smiled softly , shrugging . T HE girls and the artist had gone out and Finkel and Ruben sat at the bench eating the sandwiches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a glass of water and Finkel called to him to get one for him too . " Thank you , " Finkel said when he brought the water to him . Ruben wiped the crumbs from the table and then stood looking out the window at the traffic on the bridge , conscious of the man 's ironical eyes on his back . Finkel inspired in him a hot , unreasoning resentment and a bitter distaste . After a while Finkel went into the dressing room to take his nap and Ruben went back to work . The artist came in and came over directly to Ruben , nodding and starting to speak without preface . " I 've been walking around . I like to look around at things , observe things . I saw a man lying under the bridge . He was all dirty and his shoes were torn and he had blood on him , his nose was bleeding . People went by but nobody looked at him . You know , I shook his shoulder , but he did n't move . Maybe he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smell . " He furrowed his brow and stared at Ruben out of his large , mild eyes , eyes of the forest herbivore , innocent of guile or evil . Ruben remembered suddenly how he had used to see men lying beside the El pillars or in the doorways , sodden and sick , or dead , in a pool of blood or filth . For a long time he had not noticed them , he realized , although they were still there . He had just got used to them , he thought , like the colonial Englishman and the famine corpses . The artist came up close and watched Ruben working . He asked him what he was doing , displaying an interest , asking a question or two , and Ruben suddenly pulled the cord out and pushed the iron away . " Got ta go to the toilet , " he mumbled . The men 's toilet was out on the landing and he went out and sat on the wooden steps . He had felt it coming on , even with the fool . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure when . Someone had come and stood behind him , watching him , and suddenly his hands started trembling faintly . A sweat had broken out on his forehead , and he had sat there , numb and appalled , hands trembling and the sweat rolling down his face . Then it would happen when he was eating out , in a cafeteria with a friend , perhaps , and he was sure someone was watching , and he would put the fork or spoon down without finishing . When he went back in Clara and Alberta were sitting at the bench eating candy before going back to work and the artist was leaning against the bench beside them , regarding them pleasantly . " You know , " the artist said , " I 'd like to be able to make enough money to go to art school . I went for a little while but then my father got sick and I had to quit . And now , since he died , there 's no one to bring any money in the house . You know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much , money , but lately I seem to be thinking about it a lot . " He stared vaguely outward , as if he had lost track . " Before my father passed away he called me over and told me not to let anyone alter my determination . He said there were a lot of people who would envy me , be jealous of me , would try to persuade me that a man should spend his life working . Look what working did for me , he said , ate my lungs out in a rotten shop . He was right , I think ; do n't you ? He said , ' Alvin , if you feel you want to be an artist , be one . ' " He mused off , staring out the window . " You know , " he resumed suddenly , " when I went to art school they had girl models and they would pose naked . " " Oh , " Clara shuddered , with a feigned and delicate disgust ; " do n't talk to me , willya @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's true , " he protested . " It used to bother me when I went home to sleep ; I could n't . " Clara glared at him with a clever simulation . " You got a filthy , evil mind , you know what ? " Alberta burst out with her tremendous laugh . She stared at the artist . her eyes tearing . Her laugh was fierce and loud , galvanic , startling in its fierceness and spontaneity , and Finkel came to the door of the dressing room . " What 's the matter ? " " Why do n't you pose for him , Clara , " Ruben prompted . " You can go in the back of the loft ; nobody 'll look . You can undress in the toilet . " " Go on , do n't be smart . Nobody sees me like that , except the man who marries me ; not even him . " " 0o-what-if " Finkel said . " Well , I do n't know , " the artist said . " You have a very nice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit too stout to pose naked ; I do n't think you should , really . " " Oh , goddammit , shut up , willya ? " Clara shouted . " Do n't be so damn smart . You 're gon na get a bat in the eye , if you do n't watch out . " T HEY went back to work , the artist at the clattering , jarring riveter , working with no evident increase in speed . Finkel went out to see if he could wheedle some work . The day was oppressively gray , a low scud sweeping in from the river , and the building throbbed with the vibration of sewing machines in the lofts , and the windows rattled and dust rose every time the El went by . There was a strong , sour stench of leather from the loft below , and the acrid smell of solder from the iron Ruben was using . Alberta hummed softly to herself , her hands flying swiftly , a phrase audible here and there . It was a sad , weepy day and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blues she had known down South in her home , singing one phrase over and over with variations as subtle as shadows or the gradations of sadness . " Gon na lay my head on Some of railroad track . Gon na lay my Head on some old railroad track . " Ruben sang it after her , sly but not mocking . That was all lie knew of it . " Hush , boy , " Alberta said , directing a distant supercilious stare at him , pursing her mouth with the fierce affectation of aloofness she always used when she was being twitted and sometimes when she was annoyed , except then she did not smile . When the riveting machine was going it was almost impossible to converse , and besides , they had exhausted most topics of conversation for the while . They had talked about food the day before : that was a good one ; you could kill an afternoon easy talking about different foods , kill a few hours , anyway . Then there was the boss , but they were tired of talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They picked on some-MAGAZINE thing to think about and concentrated on it , turning it about in their minds , considering every facet of the matter ; it helped a dreary and endless day pass . Clara was thinking about love , dreaming the flesh had sloughed away , leaving her slender and lovely , her shoulders delicate and innocently beautiful , like the girls in the magazines and the movies , hips mean and sinuous like a snake . She played with the thought a while and then it palled on her , hopelessly . " Oh , nuts , " she said , half aloud , " nuts , nuts . Hell . " She turned her thoughts to supper . Ruben was thinking furtively about what the artist had said about the girl models , but then , after a while , it made him bitter and angry , and he focused his anger on the artist for bringing it up . Alberta was thinking about Billy-bee , her little old boy who had died . She thought about him quite often on dismal , gray days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shining . He had been her little old boy , down home , and he was always smiling , layin ' there in his little old bed and smilin ' . She had never told the others about Billy-bee ; she had started to tell Clara about him once on a lonesome , crazy impulse but then she had realized that there was nothing about him she wanted to tell . She thought about him now and it gave her pleasure , thinking about him , lying there , smiling , her little old boy . It was after he had died that she had packed up and come North . She thought about him and sang her little old blues softly to herself in a repetitious whine . - There 's something wrong with the machine , " the artist called . Alberta , who was nearest , went over and looked . It was out of rivets and she poured some in . She looked over into the box and he asked , " How did I do ? Is that very much ? " " You 're doin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She stood shaking her head , looking away . " Here , " she said suddenly ; " let me show you somethin ' . " She got up on the stool and started working with furious intensity , a quick , controlled savagery of motion like music , reaching for a new piece with one hand as she discarded the other . " Here , that way , " she said , climbing off the stool . " You shoulda made them in a hour , boy . " She looked away from him , sorry for the poor fool , afraid she would smile into his disappointed face . She shrugged and went back to her work . T HE artist sat at his machine as if sunk in thought . " How much could I make if I worked like that all day ? " She named a figure , not much even for those days . He sat thinking about it . " That would be nice , " he said . " I could use some money . My mother would like for me to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some brushes and paint . I saw a nice box with everything in it that an artist would need . " He shut the machine off , but the clattering of it hung on tenaciously and finally faded . " I do n't know , " he said . " I do n't like this work . I think it 's dangerous ; I do n't think I should take the chance . What good is an artist with a damaged hand ? I should n't take the chance , you know ? " " Alberta 's worked on that machine and so have we ; you wo n't get hurt if you watch yourself , " Ruben said . " Why should I have to watch myself ? I 'm an artist . " " You ain ' gon na lose no fingers , boy , " Alberta said ; " just watch yourself . " " Yes , but I 'm always thinking about something . It 's my nature , I 'm a dreamer . Suppose I 'm preoccupied and make a slip . I could very easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's crippled already , " Clara said . Alberta was laughing . " Boy , why do n't you say right out you do n't wan na work ? Why do n't you jus ' say you lazy ? " " It 's all right for us to lose our fingers , maybe ? " Clara made a loud aside . " Too bad about you , kiddo . " " You do n't understand , " he said unhappily . " Not at all . " " The Bowery is full of would-be artists , " Ruben said suddenly .
