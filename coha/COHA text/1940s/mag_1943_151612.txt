THE STRUGGLE FOR AIRWAYS IN LATIN AMERICA - William A. M. Burden-Council on Foreign Relations ( $5 ) . <P> Last year William Burden . Special Aviation Assistant to the Secretary of Commerce , said , " The air age ... is not a thing of the future . It is already here . " <P> He was speaking at a New York Herald Tribune forum on the problems that the air age gave to education . Winning the war means training youth to use air power . Creating a civilized postwar world means educating the whole U.S. to the possibilities of the new life whose framework is already here . These problems demand ' ' new world maps , a new geography , the rethinking of international relations . . . the support of an enthusiastic and discerning citizenry , " and the abiding knowledge that " in the long run , air communication is bound to develop a sense of unity among people ' ' and further " the world organization which all civilized men desire . " <P> The Struggle for Airways in Latin America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9-by-11-in. atlas in green cloth binding that documents his case and illustrates his meaning . It is a record rather than a report . Reviewing a few years of progress , from nothing to continent-girdling order , it is as spare as the pioneers ' records of their land titles and family connections . <P> The story is as simple in outline as it is complex in detail . Restricted in aviation after World War I by the Versailles Treaty , German companies , heavily subsidized , started South American lines . Slow , with poor safety records , high rates and poor equipment , and routes selected for military and political purposes , their efforts were seldom commercially successful . Only when they reached too near the Panama Canal was sluggish American opinion awakened . <P> In March 1928 , a French company , Aeropostale , opened a route from France to Dakar by plane , across the Atlantic by boat to Brazil , by plane via Uruguay to Buenos Aires . One of the great ventures of a business age . the creation of Marcel Bouilloux-Lafont , Aropostale could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reply back in less time than U.S. business correspondence could make the one-way trip from New York . <P> In comparison , the story of the first U.S. ventures , involved in the tangle of airmail contracts in the U.S .. embittered by perplexing fights over routes , makes chastening reading for Americans . A few people-Elmer Faucett of Compania de Aviacin Faucett and Hugh Wells of Cndor Peruana de Aviacin-challenged the European combines . The German stranglehold was broken when Axis airlines were nationalized by Latin American governments in the past two years . And now , says Aviation Assistant Burden , in cautious language : " The airplane promises to give Latin America a semblance of physical unity by overcoming the formidable geographical barriers which have divided it from time immemorial . . . . The airplane promises to open up this huge area rapidly . . . . The project is comparable in magnitude to the opening of our own West . "
