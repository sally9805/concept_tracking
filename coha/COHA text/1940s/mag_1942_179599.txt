One thing Britain 's House of Commons agreed upon was that Production Minister Oliver Lyttelton 's second speech was not as bad as the first one . The first one was terrible . <P> Captain Lyttelton 's maiden ministerial speech , on March 24 , was so contradictory , so shocking in its bald admission of things undone that one M.P . demanded his impeachment . Last week M.P.s were still bored by the Minister 's indecisive presentation , but they perked up their ears at what he had to say : <P> " We have now reached the point in the mobilization of our people where we can not increase production by cutting our civilian consumption . But we can improve production by better planning , better design and greater openness of mind . " <P> Since June 7 , a Joint War Production Staff has provided a means of proportionate allotment of national production between too-often loggerheaded naval , army , air and civilian requirements . U.S. and British production also has been integrated . Example : the U.S. is to supply uniforms for British troops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. soldiers in the United Kingdom . <P> This was encouraging . Nevertheless , the left-wings kept shouting about " vested interests . " Over the ominous British and U.S. shipping losses they repeated their old refrain . Emanuel Shinwell charged that British shipbuilders have mucked up production by insisting on types of ships with the greatest possible post-war commercial value . At week 's end the Government took the debate into a secret session amid cries of " No , No . " <P> Left-wing view is that , while the Government has made some concessions to radical thought , it keeps control in the hands of men it can trust . Increasingly such trust has been centered in a Churchillian inner group ( " The Club " ) , of which Captain Lyttelton is a representative member . <P> Yes &; No . Tall , toothy , socially charming Captain Lyttelton has oversize shoulders and an expanding paunch which he overemphasizes by wearing double-breasted waistcoats . His mother is a Dame of the British Empire . His father was a Cabinet minister . After Eton young Lyttelton went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter of the tenth Duke of Leeds . As an Empire businessman trained in London 's City , Captain Lyttelton fathered the world tin cartel , became managing director of giant British Metal Corp . <P> Drafted , willingly , into political life at 46 , Captain Lyttelton was first Metals Controller , moved through chairmanship of the Board of Trade to Production Minister . Because Britain needed men of ability and know-how , he was talked of as a progressive Tory candidate for Prime Minister . He spoke progressively , acted like a hard hitter . But last week Lyttelton 's career was stalling . He had not yet shown those qualities-whatever they are-that make an Englishman love a Tory .
