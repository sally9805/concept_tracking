How can the Catholic Church best use radio as a tool in proselyting ? For one , by offering good music to attract the listener and to create a mood receptive to the subsequent religious message . This is the conclusion drawn by Scripter William C. Smith from audience reaction to his two Catholic network shows , The Catholic Hour and The Hour of Faith . His conclusion and what lies behind it are set down in The Priest , a monthly published for the clergy by straitlaced , conversion-minded Bishop John Francis Noll of Fort Wayne , Ind . Some of Smith 's points : <P> " Religion is not a commodity like canned milk or steel . . . but that is no reason why a religious program should not use . . . modern radio techniques to help the audience start thinking about spiritual things . . . . I have actual tangible proof that music not only soothes the sorrowing breast , but leads the non-Catholic to be more ready and willing to accept the Catholic message . . . . <P> " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public is ready for outstanding serious music , as well as for ' the hymns that touch the heart ' - and I am not talking about Good Night , Sweet Jesus . But the purpose of all these choirs. . . is deeper than merely to provide entertainment or an emotional experience . The real purpose is to prepare the listener and . . . to soften him up for the talks featured on The Catholic Hour and The Hour of Faith . . . . <P> " The continuity writer has an opportunity to express very clearly and forcefully the dogmatic ideas behind Catholic belief in the Divine Maternity or the Sacramental Presence of Christ . . . . We do not argue , but we sing a beautiful hymn which has come from the pen and from the heart of a composer whose life has been intimately touched by this great mystery . . . . <P> " No one can ask that all listeners agree 100% with the message . . . but we can lead them . . . at least to feel 1% or 2% like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintains that we can save souls through music or continuity , but it certainly looks as if they help .
