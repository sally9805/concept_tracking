Back in London after a trip to Normandy , TIME Correspondent Mary Welsh last week cabled her feminine impression of U.S. invasion casualties and their treatment : <P> Nearly all wounded men brought to field and evacuation hospitals go first to " pre-ops " or " shock tents . " There they lie pale and uncomplaining in the eerie , khaki shadows of a single string of overhead lights while they absorb whole blood or plasma . Blood is a miraculous strength-giver . In 20 minutes drooping eyelids lift , eyes become clear and focused . Normal color returns , and the men chat with the nurses and ask for a cigaret . Then they go on operating tables , where wounds too horrible to describe get enough patchwork to allow them to go safely to England . <P> Belly wounds have priority on the operating tables . Nurses call the belly-wound ward " Wangenstein Alley , " after the inventor of a stomach suction device . In the olive-brown twilight , Wangenstein Alleys look like Spanish moss forests , with double rubber tubes descending from bottles high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> The total casualties so far consist of 20% dead ( i.e. , before they can be given medical attention ) and 80% wounded . Of the wounded , about half are able to walk . But the other half are hurt worse than Americans have ever been hurt and lived . Nobody in the tremendous U.S. medical service in Normandy underestimates the cost of the invasion .
