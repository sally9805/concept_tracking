To Judge Samuel Irving Rosenman 's reorganization of defense ( TIME , Sept. 8 , ct ante ) was added an important second chapter last week . If it worked , one of OPM 's most conspicuously unlicked prob-lems-how to spread subcontracting-would be licked at last . <P> By executive order , OPM got a new branch having equal status with production , priorities , purchasing , materials . Its name : Division of Contract Distribution . Its duties : to break down big defense orders , spread the pieces among as many plants as possible . Its complementary objectives : 1 ) to put more U.S. productive capacity to work building guns ; 2 ) to help civilian plants whose normal operations are shut off by priorities ( see col. 2 ) . <P> Utah and Wall Street 's slim , shy Floyd Bostwick Odlum got the job . The president of Atlas Corp . has long had close contacts with parts of the New Deal , was tapped for OPM by Harry L. Hopkins . He has close associations also with Defenseman Donald Marr Nelson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for nearly six months . <P> Like priorities enforcement , subcontracting has been a failure . Last February OPM set up a Defense Contract Service under Robert Lee Mehornay , Kansas City furniture manufacturer and ex-Army captain . Later Production Chief John D. Biggers brought in William E. Levis , chairman of Owens-Illinois Glass Co. ( of which Biggers was formerly president ) to help Mehornay . But little manufacturers remained on the outside looking in ; as of last month 75% of defense contracts had gone to 56 big firms . Last week 's shakeup dropped Mehornay and Levis right out of the picture . <P> Odium stepped into one of Washington 's hottest spots . Ahead lay many a fight with Army and Navy , who have yet to be convinced that subcontracting works . Ahead also was many a tussle with big contractors who prefer to take full responsibility ( and profits ) themselves . Besides straight subcontracting , another , still more difficult job faces Distributor Odlum . It is to go out and find the small specialized shops , super-artisan outfits , who have no defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get one . If he gets enough of them into the defense program . Odlum will not only speed up production but improve its quality too . <P> Odlum has the power , under an order issued by OPM last month , to write subcontracting requirements into defense contracts , even to pass up low bidders in favor of prime contractors who are willing to spread the work . No expert on the U.S. 's smaller industrial machine capacity , Odlum has always specialized in complicated , almost metaphysical empire building . Now he has to make little ones out of big ones .
