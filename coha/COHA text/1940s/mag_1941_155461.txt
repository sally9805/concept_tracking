Since World War II began , the U. S. has tried to evade one of the great moral problems of the modern world . Like all evasions , this one gained a momentary forgetfulness at the expense of a deep disquiet . The U. S. tried to evade the problem of supplying or not supplying food and medicine to the people in the conquered areas of Europe . <P> They needed both . There was no question about that . Even before the war , Europe* imported 15% of its foodstuff . A late spring , heavy rains and a poor harvest in 1940 , the mobilization of armies , the gigantic and violent transfers of millions of civilians from one area to another , the withholding from production of millions of acres , the devastation of war and the looting of the Nazis vastly increased their dependency . The 78,000,000 bushels of wheat that Poland once produced had been cut down-nobody knew how much . More than half of the wheat-growing area of France ( which once produced 244,000,000 bushels ) was in the hands of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut to eight ounces daily , meat to two ounces ( including bone ) a day . There was no butter , no lard , no coffee , little sugar . In France even Marshal Ptain had to dig out his out his ration card for the waiters , to have the coupons clipped for the grams he consumed-and an average meal meant less than four ounces of bread , three ounces of meat , half an ounce of fats-butter , lard or oil . Spain , ravaged long before the war , faced famine as the winter deepened . Typhus appeared in Warsaw . In unoccupied France , as stormy weather swept over the stricken cities , 2,000,000 children seemed doomed to malnutrition and the preventable diseases that go with it . Herbert Hoover , with contacts with most relief agencies , estimated that 18,000,000 people in Finland , Poland , Norway , Belgium and The Netherlands would be without food before the winter was over . <P> But no one could estimate the acreage of Europe 's fields of hunger . It was only certain that their crop would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth famine and the pestilences that know no boundaries . The U. S. looked on , divided between fear that the conquered , if they were not helped , might lose faith in democracy , and fear that helping them might merely release more food to their German conquerors . With native generosity blocked as it had never been blocked by famine and earthquake , the U. S. remained at dead centre , turning its thought and energy to the defense of democracy , without finding out how it could aid the victims where democracy had lost . <P> Last week the U. S. moved off dead centre . In London the Ministry of Economic Warfare announced that it would grant a blanket navicert to the American Red Cross for a shipment of food and medical supplies to France and Spain . In Washington , Red Cross Chairman Norman Davis quickly supplied details . This month the old Hog Islander S.S. Cold Harbor will sail from Baltimore , U. S. flags and Red Cross emblems ( brilliantly lighted at night ) unmistakably painted on her . To Spain will go 4,500 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milk , 250 tons of evaporated and condensed milk . There will be more drugs and supplies , less food for France : 500 tons of powdered whole milk , 250 tons of evaporated and condensed milk , 25 tons of children 's clothing , $100,000 worth of drugs and vitamin concentrates .
