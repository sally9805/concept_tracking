A new session of Parliament opened last week . The black-robed , bewigged Speaker strode up behind the gold mace and seated himself in his canopied chair . Prime Minister Clement Attlee came in early , lounged comfortably on his front bench , upped his feet on the table before him . Then Anthony Eden , Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition , immaculate as ever but notably greyer , settled down on his own front bench , with his feet on the same table . Only six feet separated the Labor and Tory soles . <P> Eden opened with a firm demand for a four-day debate on the coal nationalization bill . Government leaders made it clear that they were deadly serious about their nationalization program . Listed by Labor for passage this year were : <P> &gt; Nationalization of coal , civil aviation , overseas cable and radiotelegraph services , inland transport . The nationalization of iron and steel was still under consideration , but it looked a likely starter for 1946 . <P> &gt; A better-than-Beveridge bill to provide cradle-to-the-grave security for all . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of income . <P> &gt; A bigger workmen 's compensation bill . <P> &gt; A capital investment bill to bring all private investment under Government supervision . <P> High priority would go to repeal a legal curb which Labor has resented for 19 years-the ban on general and political strikes , passed by the Conservatives after the great strike of 1926.
