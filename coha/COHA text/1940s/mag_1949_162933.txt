For a month Berlin had been deceptively quiet , as though the antagonists , while not relaxing their holds , had paused for breath . Last week the silence was broken by a brass-lunged blast from Colonel Frank L. Howley , hard-bitten commander of the city 's U.S. sector . On New Year 's Day , two or three U.S. officials telephoned their Russian opposite numbers to wish them a prosperous New Year . When he heard of this incident last week , Howley 's quick-triggered temper exploded : <P> " Prosperous New Year-like hell ! Instructions in the Russian army manual are not to mix with us except when essential to fulfill their missions . These days we are n't trying to help the Russians fulfill their missions . " Howley promptly ordered all fraternizing with Russians in Berlin to stop , forthwith . Cried he : " None of my men are going to play footsie-wootsie with the Russians ! "
