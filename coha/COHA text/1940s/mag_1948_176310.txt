Steam from an exploding locomotive had scalded Fireman Frank Mihlan of the Erie Railroad . When he was carried into Cleveland 's Charity Hospital on July 15 , doctors thought that he had little chance of living : 70% of his body was burned . Erie Surgeons decided to try something new . They wrapped the patient in bandages made from paper-thin strips of aluminum foil , developed by Toronto 's Dr. Alfred W. Farmer . It was the first time aluminum foil for burns had been used in the U.S. , the first time it had ever been used for burns of the whole body . <P> Relief from pain was " miraculous " ; within 20 minutes Mihlan was resting comfortably . As an added precaution , he was given intravenous fluids and penicillin . The aluminum foil , which looks like the inside wrapping of a cigarette package , acts as a seal for the body fluids that seep from burned surfaces . It also helps kill bacteria , speeds healing . Twelve days after being bandaged , Mihlan was out of bed . Last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hospital .
