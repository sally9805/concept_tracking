txt Dr. Parran Disputed If the United Press dispatch of Dec. 2 quoting Dr. Parran to the effect that " room temperatures ranging from 45 to 55 degrees " are safe and tolerable is correct Dr. Parran is culpably incorrect . It is to be noted that the dispatch reads : " Dr. Parran said in a letter to the War Production Board that in the absence of scientific data on the subject he was only expressing his opinion . " One is curious to know how a scientist can express an opinion on a subject about which he has no scientific data . It is to be hoped that Dr. Parran may correct an error which , coming from so influential a source , may result in grave injury to many in our population who are not hardened to nor hardy enough to endure such frigid temperatures in their living quarters .
