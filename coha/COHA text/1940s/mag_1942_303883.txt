The civil war between W. R. Grace &; Co. and Pan American Airways over the big South American airline they own jointly ( TIME , March 16 ) got hotter last week . Grace has now asked the Civil Aeronautics Board to force Pan Am to sell or trustee enough of its stock in Panagra to give Grace clear-cut control . <P> Grace 's 13-page petition bristled with charges . Main one : Pan Am is suppressing the growth of Panagra because it wants to keep Panagra as an auxiliary , feeding passengers and freight from the eight South American countries it serves to Pan Am lines . Grace wants to make Panagra a self-contained airline , with its own terminal facilities in the U.S. ( preferably at New Orleans ) .
