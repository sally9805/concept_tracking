In Yenan last week the Communist elite of the onetime Red capital seemed gone for good , but the natives of the place-whom the Chinese Communists loved to call lao pai hsing ( the common people ) - were drifting back to town from their temporary and dusty bivouacs in the Shensi hills . TIME Correspondent Frederick Gruin looked on , then cabled this account : <P> The natives are trudging back to their shops and cave homes-mostly the very young and the rather old , mothers with suckling babes , grandmothers stilting by on bound feet , greybeards leaning on staves , small fry skipping and chirping as though their world had n't changed . <P> " To Do Business . " You peer inside a tobacco and cake shop on Nankwan Street . It is a cubicle of dried mud and sticks , windowless , papered with yellowing sheets of the Liberation Daily . Proprietor Yang Huan-chang , a snaggle-toothed elder of 60 , greets you as " Comrade , " invites you in for a smoke . <P> Why did he come back to Yenan ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . " I am too old for retreat . " He simply took refuge in a cave overlooking the city . The day after the Government troops entered-after the street-sniping ended-Yang came down . Aiya ! His shop was intact , but Government soldiers had taken his bedding and wares of toothpaste and Yenan brand cigarets . For two days he had been impressed as a water carrier . Now he was free again with a Government relief stock of cigarets and flour for ta bing ( cakes ) . <P> Does he think times ahead will be better than times past ? <P> Reflectively the old man scrapes a yellow tooth with a black fingernail . " Comrade , " says he , " a very old man should n't fret over things bygone or things to come . I only want to do business . Then all will be right . " <P> Farther along Nankwan a black-gowned merchant , Fan Kuang-kua , and his apple-cheeked wife have a counter full of cigarets , wooden combs , runty potatoes , homespun towels and dust-cloths . Yes , says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along this very street . Yes , they had been anti-American-they had said Chiang Kai-shek was trying to sell China to the U.S. What does Fan believe ? " I understand little of this , " Fan says . " I am just lao pai hsing . " <P> " Confiscate Anything . " A short walk beyond , Housewife Yu Chi-ping is sweeping debris from the dark cliffside cave in which her family lives . The table , two chairs , and a chest are gone , Yu laments . The water jar and crockery are smashed . There comes to mind the Communist high command 's directive before the Communists withdrew : " To keep our troops fit ... confiscate anything . . . . For firewood we shall use doors , windows , furniture . . . . Cooking vessels must be carried away . What ca n't be destroyed must be buried . . . . We must sacrifice for our sacred land of democracy and our president , Mao Tse-tung . "               @ @ @ @ @ @
