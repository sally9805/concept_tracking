txt One of the nation 's key building materials industries is staging a building boom of its own . Twelve new plywood plants are being ruched to completion m the Pacific northwest . Engineers and architects are drawing blueprints for eight other nulls to be erected in the next year or two . When all the wheels in these 20 plants arc whirring , productive capacity of the northwest 's plywood makers will be about a third larger than now  --  and at present this area 's mills are turning out more than two-thirds of the country 's suprey of plywood The current expansion program will mean adding half as many plants as were built since the industry was born 25 years ago Today 41 northwest plywood mills are trying to meet the constantly growing demand for this **27;789;TOOLONG . This year their production lines will roll out 2.1 billion square feet of wooden panels , the largest voltime ever produced . It will be 300 million feet more than in the perk war year of 1942 , and 500 million feet greater than last year s output @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mills now rising will ho operating by the end of this year : the others will start producing early next year . Their output  --  more than triple this area 's total production in 1925. and equal to that of 1935 ? will be close to 500 million feet annually The new plants will he the chief factor tr. raising 1949 plywood output in the Pacific northwest to an estimated 2.7 billion square feet When the other eight plants , now being planned , are producing , plywood supply will be raised to more than 3 billion square feet a year . But will that be enough for all needs ? No plywood man hereabouts is willing to guess that it will be . Even when the home building pace slackens , plywood is likely to gobbled up by hundreds of other uses . The Douglas Fir Plywood Association has compiled a list of 1.128 ways that plywood is now being used  --  from lapel buttons for convention delegates to the trim in railroad cars . And few , if any . of the users are able to get all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have compiled a " waiting list " of uses to be exploited when the time comes to beat the bushes for business . For example , there are the " F " ( for farm ) plans , now carefully tucked away for a rainy day . Just before the war began the plywood industry began a campaign to prove to the country 's farmers that their silos , barns , hog houses or grain bins could be made of plywood Some 200 experimental structures were built at about 50 U. S. colleges for demonstration purposes . But then came the war . and military demands put the farm promotion scheme , and others like it , back in a pigeonhole . For Defense , For Europe At the moment , the big demand question mark is U. S. defense and European recovery program needs . Last March , for example . the government scheduled Army-Navy 1918 demand at 65 million feet . Since then the requirement has been lifted to 88 million . It may be bigger next year . Few other big industries have grown as rapidly as plywood-making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to worry over its raw material sources . Plywood makers need a round log , up to four feet in diameter , free of knots and other blemishes , to make the thin sheets of wood which are glued together into flat , smooth panels . These logs , called " peelers , " also are the source of the best grade clear lumber . So there 's a constant battle between plywood plants and saw mills for this high-quality material . After eight years of frantic plywood lumber production , the northwest 's supply of " peelers " is being reduced  --  and no one yet has thought of a way to speed up growth of trees . The result , as one plywood maker puts it , is " a relatively Inelastic supply of raw material " Output already is beginning to push near the top limits of raw material sources , and once the new mills , now being built or planned , are producing , expansion of capacity may begin to slow down . No Price Cuts Expected Until demand slackens , or pi ocluction costs decline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mill prices . And high mill prices , of course , are reflected in high retail prices . For example , ** interior plywood ( used on the inside of houses and buildings ) before the war retailed for around 81 ; ; cents a square foot . Now in the northwest it costs 19 cents a square foot . A. %-inch exterior panel ( for outdoor and marine uses ) now retails at 20 or 21 cents a foot . Manufacturers ' prices also vary considerably . One example is /%-inch interior panels , the thickness and kind that is used for cupboard doors and table tops . At the factory , one mill quotes it at 21 cents a foot , while another is selling the material at 17 cents a foot . Distributor and dealer markups are added to these factory figures before the consumer buys a panel at his local lumber yard . One large manufacturer , in defending his prices , points to the increased production costs . " It is impossible . " he says , " to Isolate the plywood Industry from the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue to climb . Furthermore , quality of fir plywood has been improved greatly in recent years . " Everyone in the industry knows that some plywood is reaching consumers at fantastic " grey market " prices , sometimes up 250% over pre-war . These , the panel makers say , are caused by " profiteers " who obtain plywood through devious means , sell it through circuitous routes , and reap what the traffic will bear . But the volume of plywood so traded is small , manufacturers believe . Only Cure for " Grey Market " The sure-cure for the " grey market ills . " the industry maintains , is maximum production to bring the supply-demand ratio into balance . thus leaving the profiteer no margin in which to operate . Some timber owners admit " forcing " trades , which are perfectly legal . One said : " For every board foot of peeler logs we sell a plywood manufacturer , we demand the right to buy , at wholesale prices , the equivalent amount of plywood . Of course , we get paid for our logs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plywood and sell it in the grey market and make a couple of thousand dollars a car . " Log prices and labor costs are two of the biggest factors accounting for the high price tags on plywood , manufacturers claim , Log prices are more than double pre-war level . In the Puget Sound area , for example , a No. 1 peeler log now costs the plywood manufacturer about $85 per thousand feet , compared with $39 in 1941 . In Oregon 's Columbia River area , a No. 1 peeler commands $100. in prewar days , it cost only $38 . Stumpage prices are up , too . " Stumpage " does n't mean tree stumps : it 's timbermen 's terminology for any uncut trees standing in the forest , or it also may mean the value of uncut timber . In pre-way days , a good price for old growth Douglas fir stumpage was $3 50 to $4 per thousand feet . Now the average is between $15 and $30. depending on the location of the stand of trees , accessibility , size and quality . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the logger in most cases must build truck roads , or rail lines into rugged country to bring out the logs . That adds considerably to the final cost of the log Plywood men also fret about high labor costs . In 1941. the hourly base pay was 671 ; cents an hour . An increase a few weeks ago boosted the hourly minimum to 51 45 Be- cause many jobs in a plywood plant are skilled , average hourly pay scale is now $1.69. much higher than most industries . and that figure does n't include overtime . One way to help offset rising costs is to improve efficiency . New machines have been largely responsible in raising production in older plants this year . U. S Plywood Corp , another large producer and the nation 's biggest plywood distributor , is lust starting production in its new 35-million-foot capacity mill at Mapleton , Ore . Portland Plywood Co. is adding a 36 million foot mill , and the new ' Western Veneer Co. plant will have a capacity of 24 million feet . The big Pacific coast expansion in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nation . Industry spokesmen say that of some 75 hardwood plywood plants around the Great Lakes , in New England and in the south , only three of any importance have been built recently or are being built now . In South Carolina . U. S. Plywood will have a new $15 million plant in operation within a couple of months : it will be capable of turning out three million feet of one-quarter-inch hardwood plywood a month . General Plywood has practically completed work on a similar plant at Savannah , Ga . Tidewater Plywood Corp . now has in operation a recently completed plant at Brunswick , Ga .
