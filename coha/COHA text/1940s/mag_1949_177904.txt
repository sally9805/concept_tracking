The man most likely to become baseball 's rookie of the year is a huge ( 6 ft. 4 in. ) pitcher named Don Newcombe . He weighs 235 lbs . and throws baseballs so hard that to batters they look like aspirin tablets coming toward the plate . Around the National League , players agree that the hulking giant in a Brooklyn Dodger uniform is the best right-hander in the business . <P> Last week , with Brooklyn trying desperately to overhaul the front-running St. Louis Cardinals , Newcombe was wheel horse of the Dodger staff . At 23 , instead of pacing himself , he worked as if he were in a hurry to catch a train-motioning impatiently for the ball no matter whether he had just thrown a third strike or had one belted out of the park . <P> " He 's Smarter Now . " With his curve snapping and his control excellent , Newcombe shut out the St. Louis Cardinals ( 6-0 ) , the Pittsburgh Pirates ( 9-0 ) , then the New York Giants ( 8-0 ) . He went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all-before he let a run cross the plate . At week 's end , the New York Giants managed to shell him out of the box , but it was the first time in his last seven starts . His record : w. 15 , l. 6 . Although everybody has tremendous respect for his curve and control , the secret of Newcombe 's success is summed up simply in three words : he throws hard . <P> The newest of three Negro regulars now on the Dodger roster , Newcombe is also the hardest of the three to handle . On the road , Catcher Roy Campanella and Second-Baseman Jackie Robinson take turns sharing the big , moody rookie as a roomie . When he is his normal , placid , taciturn self , they needle him up to ballfield pitch . They soothe him when he gets upset and threatens to get out of line . <P> While playing with Montreal last summer , Newcombe got mad one day and went home to Elizabeth , N.J. to brood . Before the week was out , he telephoned Business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take a damn fool back ? " Last spring , at Vero Beach , Fla . Newcombe took a punch at Catcher Fermin Guerra of the Philadelphia A 's , with whom he had trouble in the Cuban League last winter . Says Teammate Robinson , referring both to Newcombe 's pitching and behavior : " He 's smarter now . " <P> " The Price , Gentlemen . " With the pressure on , there was talk of working Newcombe every third day . In next week 's vital three-game series with the Cardinals , he is scheduled for two of them . Says he : " I 'll throw as much as they want me to . " <P> As long ago as last fall , Dodger Boss Branch Rickey realized what he had in Newcombe . When the dollar-splurging Pittsburgh Pirates asked the Montrealer 's price , Rickey put a half-serious $1,000,000 tag on him ; that drew a short answer from Pirate General Manager H. Roy Hamey : " You keep Newcombe ; I 'll keep my million . " Later , before the 1949 season opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The price , gentlemen , is a half-million dollars , and when I say a half million I do n't mean $499,000 . " <P> He is not for sale any more .
