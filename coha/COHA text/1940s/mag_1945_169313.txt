Even in tragic China the war picture grew brighter for the moment . Japanese commanders , their communications harassed by locomotive-busting Fourteenth Air Force pilots , had been sweeping aside light , ill-armed Chinese troops to smash the U.S. air bases one by one . But last week they tried for Chihkiang , 300 miles east of Chungking , and ran into something new and hard . <P> As their columns moved westward from the Paoking area , northward from Chengpu , the usual ragged Chinese armies were suddenly stiffened by U.S.-equipped units , tough and battlewise . The Japs , who had set out on a mere punitive expedition , found themselves fighting a hard , draining battle . <P> For the Japanese this was a foretaste of the future . The days of easy victories in China were fast passing . Exultantly Lieut . General Albert C. Wedemeyer , able commander of American forces in China , could promise his men that , with the end of the war in Europe , " our turn is coming . "        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
