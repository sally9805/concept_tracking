txt - The emergency board appointed by the President , after careful study , has recommended a settlement of the railway wage dispute which , in view of all the known facts , seems more than fair to the unions ; but the leaders of the five railway brotherhoods announce that they can not accept it . If their unions support them , a grave crisis will develop . The emergency board has recommended a wage increase of 71/ per cent for the five railroad brotherhoods and an average increase of 13% per cent for the fourteen non-operating unions . When one recalls that while there are 350,000 employes in the five brotherhoods , there are 800,000 in the 4'ourteeu other unions , it will be recognized that this increase would place a very heavy burden on the railroads . The emergency board itself estimates that the increases it recommends would raise the wage cost of the railroads by $270,000,000 a year . The board further recommends that the increase , which would be retroactive to Sept. 1 , should expire at the end of 1942 unless the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely a just but even a generous recommendation should be recognized when we recall what the existing situation on the railroads is . In a letter published on this page on Nov. 4 Elisha . M. Friedman pointed out that in 1939 the average annual earnings of railroad workers were about 50 per cent more than for other industries . The annual wages of conductors in 1940 averaged $3,000 , and locomotive engineers $3,300 ? which exceeds the average annual earnings of university-trained professional men ? doctors , lawyers , dentists and engineers . That any wage increase granted should be temporary rests on the knowledge that the usual traffic and earnings of the railroads today are themselves temporary . Thirty per cent of railroad mileage is already operated by receivers or bankruptcy trustees . The President 's board suggests that even to grant the wage increases it recommends might necessitate higher freight rates . But this would be to saddle still higher costs on other industries , and it would mean a further loss of railway business to other means of transportation . In view of the generosity of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the imperative necessity , not merely to the welfare but to the very safety of the country at this time , that the railroads be kept running without a day 's interruption , it will be a shocking thing if the railroad unions refuse to accept this settlement and exploit their strategic position to attempt to force excessive concessions from the country . If they attempt to do this , a heavy part of the responsibility for their action will rest on the Administration 's labor policy to date ? which has been extremely complacent toward strikes , and which has been seeking to buy off one strike after another by granting the strikers most of what they wanted through the National Defense Mediation Board . That board , while declaring that it was " deciding each case on its own merits , " has been , in fact , laying down a , labor policy of continuous inflationary wage increases . Only by a firm wage policy ? in which we might do well to study the example of Canada  --  can we hope to bring this dangerous spiral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
