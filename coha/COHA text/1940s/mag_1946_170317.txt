The latest Swedish miler intends to compete for only two years . He expects the long awaited four-minute mile to be run within that time , and he intends to be on the field that day , chasing or being chased . <P> Two years ago when Lennart Strand was 22 , he did not realize that he was a runner of promise . Just out of the Swedish Army , he heard that famed Gunder Hgg lived in the same block and volunteered to work out with him . He entered a few races , proved to be a first-rate pacesetter and gradually became known in Sweden as " Hgg 's rabbit . " One day , the rabbit turned on the dog ; Strand was in front of Hgg at the finish line . Paavo Nurmi exclaimed : " The most outstanding runner I have ever seen . " <P> Fortnight ago Hgg 's rabbit arrived in Manhattan , a lanky fellow with lean , muscular legs , a squirrel 's face and an antelope 's lope . Like most Swedish trackmen he was in sad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but said he had already learned the " Indian language " ( uh-uh ; uh-huh ; huh ) . He knew all about U.S. jazz ( he plays the piano , violin and banjo by ear ) . In Manhattan , Strand listened to Swingdom 's blind piano player Art Tatum , his favorite , then went off reluctantly to California . But the Swedish speedster , a printer by trade , did not forget what he came over for . <P> Like most Norse runners , Strand prefers practicing on soft ground or a pine-needled trail rather than on a cinder track . Although he brought three pairs of Swedish shoes with him because he thinks U.S. track shoes are inferior , Strand ran two miles twice a day in his bare feet . Last week he made his U.S. debut . <P> His opposition in the 1,500-meter run at Compton College was not topflight , but Strand 's time was . ( Like Glenn Cunningham , he races against himself . ) He ran , as usual , with both palms up , fingers curled - as though he were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the finish Strand was yards in front , unhurried , and two-tenths of a second off Les MacMitchell 's meet record of 3:51.4 . He might not run the four-minute mile at the San Antonio A.A.U. championships this month , but U.S. tracksters already regarded him with brooding respect . Hgg 's rabbit would be hard to beat .
