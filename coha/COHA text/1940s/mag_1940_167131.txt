For 17 of his 42 years , lean , bald , stubble-lipped Arnaldo Cortesi was a correspondent for the New York Times in Rome . Son of a robust , retired Italian journalist ( who had for 29 years been head of the Associated Press bureau in Rome ) and a Boston mother , Cortesi was perfectly equipped to tell U. S. citizens about Mussolini 's Italy . <P> On New Year 's Day , 1939 , the Italian Government told him to quit his job . <P> along with some 200 other Italian newsmen who worked for alien bureaus . Shortly thereafter , Arnaldo Cortesi left Italy , went to Mexico City for the Times . There , last week , he was once more in hot water , this time of his own heating . <P> One day last month , Cortesi sent the Times a long , brilliantly documented dispatch telling in detail of Nazi-Communist preparations in Mexico . For months Cortesi had gathered evidence of German infiltration in Mexico , German and Russian influence over labor and the press . <P> Said Timesman Cortesi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pave the way for invading armies , but ... to create a diversion south of the Rio Grande capable of diverting the attention of the United States . . . from events in Europe . " Next day , Hal Burton reported substantially the same facts to the New York Daily News , and the lid was off . <P> A Mexican newspaper , El Popular , organ of Vicente Lombardo Toledano 's Mexican Federation of Labor , opened fire on Cortesi and Burton . Ever since the Nazi-Soviet pact last August , El Popular has carried on a relentless campaign of invective against democracy . Not even Mexico 's pro-Nazi magazine Timon can equal the virulence of El Popular ' 1- attacks on the U. S. , President Roosevelt , Britain and France . <P> El Popular printed a " translation " of Cortesi 's story which omitted most of the evidence , distorted the facts . Genaro Vasquez , Attorney General of Mexico , promptly summoned both newsmen to appear and prove their statements . Burton , in Mexico on special assignment , quietly departed . Last week he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , presented his case . <P> Meanwhile , other correspondents who had known of fifth-column activities in Mexico but hesitated to report them , followed Cortesi 's lead and filed their stories . They met the same treatment . <P> From the files of Edward Morgan , United Press chief in Mexico City , two telegrams sent from U. P. in Manhattan were stolen and printed by El Popular as evidence of a " war of nerves " against Mexico . Since the messages were not for publication-U . P. 's Morgan was not summoned . <P> President Lazaro Cardenas and his Government last week played ostrich , denied there was any Nazi or Communist influence at work in Mexico .
