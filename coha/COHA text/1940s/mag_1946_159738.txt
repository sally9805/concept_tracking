What is the most important news story in the world today ? Russia , says the New York Times 's Publisher Arthur Hays Sulzberger . And how many men has the Times got on it ? One-and the paper had a hard time getting that one in . <P> It took ex-Theater Critic Brooks Atkinson six months and a personal cablegram to Joseph Stalin to get accredited to Moscow . Even before he left New York , the Times began going through the red tape necessary to get his successor in . Last week the Times succeeded . It had taken nearly a year and the intercession of U.S. Ambassador " Beedle " Smith to get the visa . Said Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Vishinsky to Beedle Smith : " The New York Times is not particularly friendly to Russia . " <P> Out from behind Moscow 's iron curtain , after ten months , comes erudite , ironic Atkinson , to rest a spell and then perhaps to return to Broadway 's asbestos curtains . In goes chubby , energetic Drew Middleton , one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 32 , goes to Russia with few illusions . He regards the Moscow assignment as " something every reporter should do once at least . " He has agreed to buck it for the next two years . <P> Good Eye , Good Ear .

His up-front combat stories showed a reportorial eye , a literary ear . <P> In the thankless task of covering SHAEF , he frequently clashed with the censors . He had the energy to get around on his own , the imagination to infuse official communiqus with color and meaning . <P> Middleton 's aggressiveness will be a change from Atkinson 's urbane inquisitiveness . Colleagues are curious to see whether Middleton will check his shoulder chip at the Russian frontier . Says National Correspondent James ( " Scotty " ) Reston , himself a Times topnotcher : " Moscow will be good for his temper . It will teach him patience or kill him . "
