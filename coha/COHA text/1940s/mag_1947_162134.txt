The House Committee on Un-American Activities last week got around to Communist Gerhart Eisler 's younger brother Hanns . <P> Hanns , Hollywood composer and author of a new book criticizing the movies ( TIME , Sept. 29 ) , sweated and squirmed under the Washington kleigs as he listened to Committee Chief Investigator Robert Stripling describe him as " the Karl Marx of Communism in the field of music . " Like Brother Gerhart , Hanns demanded the privilege of reading a statement to the committee . Chairman J. Parnell Thomas shouted an angry refusal . Thereupon , like Brother Gerhart , Eisler handed out typewritten copies of his statement to newsmen : " This hearing is both sinister and ridiculous . ... I would be delighted to spend as much time as this committee will allow to lecture on ... the art of the fugue . But . . . this committee has called me only in order to . . . smear me . " <P> For the first few days , the committee seemed not particularly interested in bald , fat little Hanns Eisler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list of " certain prominent persons " who , it charged , had tried to help Eisler enter the U.S. The list sparkled with glittery names : Radio Commentator Raymond Swing , onetime Willkieman Russell Davenport , Hollywood Director William Dieterle , Columnist Dorothy Thompson and Eleanor Roosevelt . <P> " Dear Sumner . " Not unaware of the headlines it was about to make , the committee called upon Sumner Welles , former Under Secretary of State , to identify two " Dear Sumner " notes which Mrs. Roosevelt had written to him concerning Eisler in 1939 . Eisler , as a refugee music professor from Hitler Germany , was then attempting to get into the U.S. through Cuba , but was being denied a visa as a suspected Communist . With her first note , on White House stationery , Mrs. Roosevelt sent Welles a batch of papers given to her by a friend of Eisler 's , a " perfectly honest person , " who thought that the case had not been examined carefully enough . Wrote Mrs. Roosevelt : " Why not do it all over again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his wife defend themselves ? " <P> To " Dear Eleanor , " his friend since childhood , Sumner Welles wrote a long and friendly letter . But it added up to a brush-off : the State Department had reason to believe that Eisler was a Communist ; visas could not be given to Communists ; the U.S. consul general at Havana would listen to whatever evidence Eisler could present on his own behalf , but the law would have to be followed . <P> Mrs. Roosevelt sent off a second note : " This Eisler case seems a hard nut to crack . What do you suggest ? " This brought another polite brush-off from Welles . Last week Mrs. Roosevelt , now busy with U.N . duties , told newsmen that she had never met Eisler and did not remember writing the notes to Welles . " When I was in the White House , " she said airily , " I had hundreds of such requests a month , and , depending on the character of the request , the letters were passed on to the correct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
