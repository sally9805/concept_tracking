 | More people are taking examinations today than ever before . Members of the armed forces , first aiders , civilian-defense workers ? all these and more have been added to the ranks of regular students to whom examinations are a familiar part of education . Many students have an attitude of complete antagonism toward examinations . All too often they regard them as a sword of Damocles hanging over their heads and threatening them with disaster . This fear is the worst enemy of the student . And yet , to some extent it is understandable . " Flunking " an examination can be a serious matter , especially when it means loss of time and money or failure to obtain a degree or diploma . Unpleasant though they may seem , examinations are necessary . They compel a review of the subject as a whole , which is essential to final understanding . Examinations test the student 's ability to learn and remember , also his power to analyze ideas and discriminate between essential and nonessential facts . There is no better method for gauging the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are two main types of examination , written and practical or laboratory . A written examination is more formal , and it usually has questions requiring longer , fuller answers . It may require a logical , systematic essay . The practical test evaluates the student 's knowledge and skill in recognizing what he has studied , such as flowers in botany ; following some procedure or test , as in chemistry ; showing some special skill , such as use of tools or machines ; using his knowledge and ability to meet problem situations , as in the medical examination of a patient . Most students are not trained in methods of taking examinations . It is remarkable how few work out a really efficient system . In spite of the frequency with which examinations recur in their lives , they never evolve a clear-cut plan for meeting them . Here are some rules for passing exams : The first requisite is to overcome examination-anxiety . It seems almost a tradition that a state of excitement must be generated , which may amount to an emotional crisis in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in such a state . It is best to remember that the great majority of candidates who take exams succeed in passing them . If you have average ability and have done a reasonable amount of work , you are going to pass . Fix that in your mind at the start . Next , review the subject as a whole immediately prior to the examination . Note carefully that the word review is used , not learn . Learning must have been accomplished earlier . The prime requisite for an examination is knowledge . There is no use trying to acquire this at the last moment . It is foolish to expect to stock the mind in two or three weeks at the end of a year with what should have been learned throughout the whole year . By phenomenal feats of memory , an examination may be passed by cramming in the case of a subject where only memory counts . But this can not be done if an understanding of the subject is necessary , the acquired knowledge is needed to work out problems , or a practised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or three weeks a subject already learned is a different matter and can be done . It refreshes the memory and brings facts into mind recently enough before the examination for them to be remembered and used . In this review a classification and a skeletonized framework of the subject should be mastered , so that the major and fundamental facts of all parts are ready for use at the examination . If the fundamental portion known , details will come to min and can be used . Do not waste tint , on details that are without significance , but review the main factgeneral rules and principles of the subject . Avoid trying to memoriz ? ; isolated facts , but learn definite examples of a law or principle , these will be useful .

Do not antagonize the examiner by making the paper difficult to read and mark . And do n't try tricks to get good marks . The examiners know all the tricks and excuses . They once were students themselves . Read the question paper carefully . See that you understand clearly the meaning of each question . Then decide which question you are able to answer most easily . Start with this question . As you write you will warm up mentally , just as an athlete does physically . Your brain will function better and faster , and ideas and knowledge you thought you had forgotten will come to you , once you are well  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confidence and ability to tackle the second . Select the next easiest and do it . Carry on similarly with the remaining questions . As you proceed you will find that ideas will present themselves to you on what had seemed very difficult parts of the examination and work that at first appalled you you will be able to do without the least hesitation . Answer what is asked . Do not write on irrelevant subjects , but make sure you answer all that is asked , not just part of it . Allocate your time in proportion to the size and value of the question . This is important . Do n't spend double the time allotted on one question and skimp that necessary for the others , as students frequently do . Make your answer orderly , systematic , and neat . This will make it easy for you to think and to keep track of what you write . Also it will impress the examiner with the fact that you know your subject and have command of it . The way to do this is to make an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer in one solid block . Use headings for the various points , and follow each with a paragraph explaining it . At a glance you can see what parts of a subject you have covered and what still remain . In order to accomplish this , you should plan your answer during the first minute or so , noting the words to be used for headings , so that they are readily usable . You may find it convenient to have some scratch paper . NUMBER your questions and leave a space of at least ten or fifteen lines at the end of each answer , so that you easily can add any points that occur to you later . Remember that while system , order , and neatness help the examiner to read your answer , they will help you even more to write a good answer . Do not think you are doing this as a favor to the examiner . You are doing it to benefit yourself . Indeed , all the work you do before and during an examination is for yourself . An extremely common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the student , which he should have included but did n't . They are omitted because he feels it unnecessary to include them . He considers that since he is writing for someone who knows the answer , he can leave out certain facts and the examiner will infer that because the student knows the part written , he must know the remainder . This is a false point of view . The examiner , naturally , can mark only what is written . He wants to know how much you know ; he can not infer it . If you want good marks , write the facts so that they may be marked . Do not leave them out . Reread and correct your answers before leaving the examination . Always try to have a few minutes for this valuable review of your statements . Additional information often will come to mind and can be added at the time in the spaces you have left blank . Do n't get excited . Keep cool . Think clearly . Be systematic and thorough . Add a fund of knowledge from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attributes of success .
