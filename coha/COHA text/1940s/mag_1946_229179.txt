Sedosan , with the well-known unity trade mark , is the most sensational discovery of the new age-more effective than aspirin . . . more victorious than penicillin . For Sedosan . . . cures everything . . . Sedosan stills the worker 's hunger , protects the freezing intellectuals . . . eliminates " reactionaries " . . . transforms Nazis , according to a guaranteed process , into screaming red SEDers . <P> " Dear Child . " With such sarcastic editorials , Berlin 's non-Communist newspapers last week ridiculed the cure-all campaign promises made by SED ( the Communist-run Socialist Unity Party ) in a desperate attempt to win votes for Berlin 's municipal elections Oct. 20 . Sedists ( as Berliners have begun to call SEDers ) personally took credit for such timely Russian favors as last week 's distribution of cigarets and liquor to Berliners , and the special allotment of clothing and shoes to 60,000 children . SED distributed notebooks to children with the inscription : " Instead of using this paper for a campaign pamphlet , the Socialist Unity Party of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this notebook . Study diligently and thus make your parents happy . Signed , SED . " <P> Sedists know that this time , as Berlin slang puts it , " Es geht um die Wurst " ( " The sausage is at stake , " meaning : this is it ) .. The elections ( at which Berliners will choose 130 city councillors and 805 district assemblymen ) are Germany 's first to be supervised jointly by all four occupying powers . This means that , for once , SED will have to compete honestly with its rival parties ( the Liberals , Christian Democrats and Social Democrats ) . Even without joint central control , in Russian zone elections last month SED polled only a bare 52% majority . <P> Worst of all , the Russians are getting impatient . They are beginning to suspect that their heavy investment of monetary and moral support for SED has been unsound . In addition to the Sedists ' relatively poor performance at the polls , several political divergencies have appeared . Foreign Minister Molotov recently had to slap down a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up some of the German territory she got at Potsdam . Grotewohl also objects mildly to Russia 's super-combine of German industries in the Russian zone ( TIME , Aug. 26 ) and to her peace-delaying tactics ( cried he in an interview with TIME : " Please , a peace treaty ! And quickly ! " ) . <P> Holiday Ahead . Some of these disagreements may well be faked in order to persuade Germans that SED is really not Soviet-controlled . But there could be no doubt that the Russians no longer relied on SED as an instrument of control . They were tightening their grip through other means , such as the top-secret creation of a German zonal police organization ( reportedly including a new German secret police ) . <P> Said Communist Boss Wilhelm Pieck : " SED will not have the majority in Berlin . " If his prediction is right , Russia is likely to abandon the party , and party leaders know it . Last week , a U.S. newsman , roaming through SED 's Berlin headquarters , ran into fat , pink Max @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Very busy , very busy . " " Naturally , " replied the correspondent . " With the elections coming up . "
