txt Arbitration of the General Motors strike , with an immediate return to work , was proposed by the United Auto Workers , CIO , today . The proposal was made in a letter to Charles E. Wilson , president of the General Motors Corporation . It calls for appointment by President Truman of an arbitrator who would consider the differences between the latest proposals of the corporation and the union . His decision would be made within forty-five days and be accepted as final . General Motors will reply to the arbitration proposal at 2 P. M. tomorrow , corporation officials said after conferences in a hospital room with Mr. Wilson and elsewhere . ? Earlier today Harry W. Anderson , vice president of GM , accused the top officials of the United Automobile Workers of deliberately prolonging the 102-day strike against the company in order to further their own personal political ambitions within the union . Union Makes Quick Denial Mr. Anderson prefaced his accusation with an additional allegation that the union leaders were not bargaining as " free agents , " and quoted a colloquy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the UAW and head of its General Motors Department . The UAW swiftly denied Mr. Anderson 's charges . Mr. Anderson not only charged that the union leaders were for personal reasons preventing a settlement of a strike which had kept 175,000 employes idle for nearly fifteen weeks , but added that the strike probably would not be settled until following the international convention of the UAW , beginning March 23 in Atlantic ' City and scheduled to adjourn on March 30 . Breaking the silence maintained studiously by the corporation for weeks , Mr. Anderson met with about fifty reporters in the board of directors room on the fifteenth floor of the General Motors Building for more than an hour . He did not dodge a question , and from the records kept by company officials he lifted quotations tending to put the union in the position of holding out for 8 cents a day ? at 1 cent an hour  --  and because of disagreement over the phraseology of one clause in the old contract . 18 %2 Offer Declared Final In making its suggestion that the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeated a proposal made on Nov. 19 in an attempt to avert the strike . At that time the union was threatening to walk out in order to enforce its demand for an increase of 30 per cent , or about 35 cents an hour . Currently the company is offering 18V , cents , the same amount is that granted by the Chrysler Corporation and the steel industry and one-half cent more than that given by the Ford Motor Company . Mr. Anderson said that the offer was the " absolutely final " proposal , that would be acceptable to the , company . He emphasized again . and again the point that the col. ; poration would make no further : concession in order to bring about a conclusion of a walkout that had become the longest and most costly , in the history of the automotive industry . ? - The corporation and union nego. // tiators met for about two hours this morning , under the chairmanship of James F. Dewey , special Federal mediator appointed by the Secretary of Labor . Mr. Dewey later sat at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Mr. Anderson conducted his press conference . Mr. Anderson criticized Mr. Dewey in mild fashion for his statements of optimism during the negotiations in recent weeks , hastening to add that he did not think that any man could have met such a barrage of questions from reporters " without making some comment which could be misconstrued . " Although the union and company representatives are scheduled to resume negotiations at 10:30 Monday morning , there was no indication from either side that much could be expected in the way of constructive developments , unless the company reversed its position by accepting the proposal for arbitration . Former Offer Assailed by GM The suggestion by the union differed from that made on Nov. 19 in that , as opposed to a three-man board suggested then to arbitrate the matter , the union asked today that President Truman name one man whose decision would be " final and binding upon both parties . " The November suggestion by the UAW was rejected by the corporation on Nov. 23 as having been advanced by the union with the full knowledge that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to insure their rejection . The proposal was made then , the company stated , only so that when the expected rejection occurred the company could be blamed " for a strike which the union had been planning for many months . " It was , the corporation stated , not " an offer of arbitration but a demand for arbitration . " It was near the close of Mr. Anderson 's press conference that the inevitable question , motivated 13y repeated rumors in recent weeks , was asked . One correspondent inquired whether Mr. Anderson imputed to Mr. Reuther a degree of insincerity in the latter 's efforts to settle the strike . " I 'd say that all of the union leaders in these negotiations have been slow to move to make a settlement because of the impending convention in Atlantic City on March 23 or 24 , whenever it is , " Mr. Anderson replied . " They have refused to make a settlement according to what has become the pattern in the auto and steel and many other industries . " I think that this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do now might be prejudicial in their political futures within the union . " They are the ones who have been responsible . In that , I 'd throw in all the union officers who are engaged in the negotiations . The convention stands in the way of a settlement . There is a great possibility that the strike wo n't be over until following the convention . " Then Mr. Anderson was asked whether he felt that the appearance of Philip Murray , international president of the Congress of Industrial Organizations , could hasten a settlement of the walkout . He replied negatively . Mr. Anderson said that only one cent an hour and a total change of sixty-six words in one clause of the contract were separating the two parties . This clause was No. 63 , which , in the form sought by General Motors , would give the company the right to make transfers on the spot in the interest of efficiency , with permanent promotions to be based according to the union argument that senority should be the prevailing factor . The company suggested the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to make the clause satisfactory . Mr. Anderson said that two weeks ago tonight Mr. Wilson had made a " Herculean attempt to settle the strike " by granting Reproduced with permissio union demand after demand with the exception of maintenance of membership , Clause 63 , vacation pay and the wage demand . Since then , he stated , the union ' had agreed to company proposals regarding maintenance of membership and the check-off , vacation pay  --  involving an incentive feature  --  and had held out only against the wage offer and the rephrasing of Clause 63 . Following is the text of Clause 63 of the old General Motors contract , parentheses in the first paragraph showing what the company wishes to omit from any new contract , and the second paragraph representing a part which the company wishes to insert : " The ( temporary ) transferring of employes is the sole responsibility of the management . ( Rules for permanent transfers between occupational groups , filling vacancies and new positions shall be negotiated locally and included in the local seniority agreement . ) In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merit and capacity are equal , employes with the longest seniority will be given ( preference . Any claims of personal prejudice or any claims of discrimination for union activity in connection with transfers may be taken up as grievances . Such claims must be supported by written evidence at the time the grievance is filed . - " Any employe who is ambitious to secure advancement to a better job should make his wants , together with his experience , known to his foreman . Every practical effort will be made by supervision to cooperate with such employes to attain the desired objective . " effect until April 28 , its date of expiration . " On Dec. 15 , 1945 , the UAW told us that they could not accept the offer because it might hurt the position of the United Steel Workers , " he said . " Walter Reuther , " he added , reading from a purported transcript , " said that he had talked with Philip Murray , who told him that if we accepted the offer before our contract expired it would have set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take it , too . " Mr. Anderson quoted Mr. Reuther as saying : " We would have put him ( Mr. Murray ) in an embarrassing position , because by that time ( April 28 ) 131/2 cents would have become the pattern for the country . " " Mr. Wilson said , " Mr. Anderson continued in reading from the record , " ' You are telling me , then , that you fellows are not free agents here . ' " . When reporters pressed for a continuation of the exchange of remarks , Mr. Anderson said that apparently the subject of conversation had been " switched " at that point . " Gentlemen , " Mr. Anderson continued , " I should like to point out that by refusing to accept our offer of Dec. 6 , the strikers have , individually , lost a total of $700 . It will take them seven years to make up their loss by not taking 13% cents instead of the 18% cents we are now offering them . " " By delaying their acceptance for two days , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to say , a man now making $1.20 an hour would have been making $1.385 . That is a loss in wages of $11.08 a day , or $22.16 for two days . That means it would take 2,216 hours to make up his two-day loss . " Mr. Wilson said the corporation had expected to be working at a rate of more than 2,000 hours a man per year by this time . Mr. Anderson 's remarks met a quick rebuff and denial from the General Motors conference of delegates from the striking locals , which stated , as part of a resolution : " This accusation ( concerning union politics ) represents a last , desperate effort on the part of the corporation to create a division in our ranks and to cover up GM 's own failure to meet its responsibilities to its employes and to the nation . The record will show that every action and every decision of the UAW-CIO in our dispute with General Motors had the solid backing of all top union officers since the Flint board meeting ( of the International Executive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every decision of the strike strategy committee has been unanimous . " The conference adopted another resolution which recommended that in the event of a rejection by the corporation of the proposal for arbitration under a single arbitrator , appointed by the President , the Dec. 6 Offer Recalled Mr. Anderson said that on Dec. 6 the company had offered an increase of 13% cents an hour , with the 1945 contract , which had not then been cancelled , to remain in union " intensify strike action " and ' " carry on until the strike is won .
