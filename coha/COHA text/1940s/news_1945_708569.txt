txt The . nal , official tabulation of the solier vote , announced today by the lureau of Census , shows that the bsentee ballots of the armed ervices were not only extraordiiarily light but in no instance suficient to determine the outcome n a single close state in the 1944 iresidential election . These are the central facts : The soldier vote accounts for mly 5.6 per cent of the total popilar vote . Only three out of 10 persons of noting age , away from home in he military services , cast absentee military ballots . Of the 4,110,767 state ballots sent to military voters , 2,793,203  --  or about two out of three , were returned , and of those returned , 17 per cent arrived in time for ? , : ounting and were otherwise valid . Total Vote Recorded me popular presidential vote vas 48,025,684 , of which 2,691,160 overe absentee military votes , over ialf of which were returned by six states : New York , 422,698 ; Pennsylvania . 255,266 ; California , 181,421 ; Ohio , 164,472 ; New Jersey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of previous counts in some states where the ballots were separated , it is estimated that the total soldier vote went about 60-40 to Franklin Roosevelt 's advantage , but there is no evidence that in any state the weight of the soldier vote was large enough to alter the result of the civilian vote . The ratio of presidential votes which were absentee military ranged from 2 per cent for Alabama to 10 per cent for Georgia . In Georgia , the lowering of the voting age to 18 weighed heavily in the military vote . Relatively high percentages were reported for Virginia . 9.9 ; New Jersey , 8.4 ; Wyoming , 8 ; Rhode Island , 7.7 : Connecticut , 7.2 ; Oregon , 7 , and New York , Pennsylvania , and Michigan , each 6.7 . City Vote Higher Military absentee votes cast in metropolitan centers appear to have run proportionately higher than those in outside areas . The ratio is indicated to have been about 5 to 4 in favor of the metropolitan centers . For example , the proportion of absentee military voters to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cities show New York City , 5.47 per cent compared to 4.21 per cent for the rest of New York State ; Detroit , 5.46 per cent compared to 4.38 for rest of Michigan ; Denver , 4.75 per cent compared to 4.03 for rest of Colorado , and Baltimore , 3.2 per cent compared to 2.8 per cent for rest of Maryland . The Federal Government in 1942 adopted legislation for military voting , but that year , owing to mechanical difficulties , military voting was extremely light . Before the 1944 election , this law was superseded by another providing a Federal ballot to members of the armed forces and civilian members of organizations serving with the armed forces , outside the United States . Post Cards Provided Tne Army and Navy were required by law to provide each person of voting age in military service with an application post card . The ratio of applications for ballots on Federal post cards , to all other applications reported , was 3 to 2 . This ratio may not indicate the relative influence of the Fed- eral post card on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the extent and nature of duplications between post cards and other applications , and the liberal distribution of the post cards . ? Ballot applications totaled 4 , - 387,540 , and general-election ballots sent totaled 4,110,767 . The practice in a number of states of sending ballots to those registered voters known to be in. the armed forces , and the fact that relatives and friends in some states were permitted to make applications in the name of military personnel , obscure the degree of initial personal interest on the latter 's part in getting ballots . In some states , as in New York , receipt of a Federal ballot from someone who had voted thereon was treated by state and local officials as an application for a state ballot , since the Federal ballot was not valid there . The 20 states which accepted as valid the Federal war ballot received a total of 84,835 effective Federal ballots , 8 per cent of their effective military ballots , or 3.2 per cent of all effective absentee military ballots . Vote in Percentages Except for Texas the percentage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Federal ballqts ranged from 2.7 per cent in Massachusetts to 12.7 per cent in Washington . In Texas , nearly two thirds or 63.8 per cent of effective absentee service ballots were Federal . since Federal ballots were valid without evidence of the voters having paid the poll tax , while state ballots were not valid without such evidence . Primary election ballot applications numbered less than 500,000 , and were divided about evenly between Federal post card forms and others permitted or provided by state law . More than 9 per cent of the 179,000 primary ballots returned were ineffective , by reason of lateness or otherwise . Time available for voting state ballots was lengthened by almost all states in 1944 . Many primary elections were advanced to permit more time between nomination and election , for within that period ballots had to be prepared and distributed . While ballots had to be marked in all cases at least by election day , 10 states allowed a longer period for receipt of ballots by election officials . In the general election , three states allowed 11 to 28 days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 60 to 99 days , and two , Connecticut and Idaho . allowed 123 days .
