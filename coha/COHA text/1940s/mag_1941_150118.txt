Meyer Hiler , about 75 , is proud of his son Hilaire . So is all San Francisco . Hilaire Hiler 's murals in Aquatic Park are now one of the sights of the town . Papa Hiler has a quiet reputation of his own , as a theatrical agent . A hobby-rider , he also likes to paint pictures-brightly colored , engagingly irresponsible pictures of beach scenes , toylike Venetian canals , imaginary Oriental landscapes , houses like patchwork quilts . Last week Sutter Street 's Raymond &; Raymond Gallery was exhibiting some of Papa Hiler 's paintings . The critics were pleasantly taken aback . Said the San Francisco Chronicle 's Alfred Frankenstein : " He sets up quite regular rhythmic patterns and then answers them in a kind of sudden , surprising syncopation . It is the nearest visual approach to hot jazz . " <P> Anxious not to capitalize on his son 's reputation , Papa Hiler treated his late entrance into the art world with good-natured deprecation . Said he : " There is no message in my pictures . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never had any intention of becoming an artist . " But Son Hilaire was bursting with filial pride . " I know enough about painting , " said he , " to know he does n't know a damn thing about it . If I gave him a single lesson he would be terrible . He 's one of the few real primitives . I know he 's no fake , as some so-called primitives are . He 's to painting what Saroyan is to writing : neither knows a thing about his craft ; each does a damn good job . "
