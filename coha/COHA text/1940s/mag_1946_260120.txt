It does n't pay to hit Joe Louis so hard it hurts him . By keeping things on a friendly basis , such smart boxers as Bob Pastor and Billy Conn induced the Brown Bomber to toy with them for as many as eleven and 13 rounds before the inevitable kill . But Tami ( rhymes with mammy ) Mauriello , the tubby Bronx challenger , decided to play rough . At the opening bell of last week 's title fight he walked out from his corner , took one look at the overconfident Louis , and pitched a right with the urgency of a man unloading a hand grenade . It connected , and the world 's heavyweight champion went reeling across the ring . <P> If Tami had been quicker on the trigger , he might have followed up his advantage . Instead , he reaped the whirlwind . While the small ( 38,494 ) Yankee Stadium crowd was still oohing in amazement , Louis bounced off the ropes and went to work . Tami went down under a barrage of lefts and rights , got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solid sock , took half a dozen in return . Then he slid slowly down the rpes and assumed the inelegant position of 20 Louis challengers before him . <P> When his head stopped buzzing , he explained it all very clearly , on the ABC national hookup . Said he : " I thought I could knock him out but I got too goddam careless . " Said the announcer : " Thanks very much , Tami . " <P> The time of the knockout , 2 min. 9 sec. of the first round , was a near record for Louis . In 1938 it took Joe just 2 min. 4 sec. to polish off Max Schmeling , who had made the mistake of knocking out Louis in their previous meeting .
