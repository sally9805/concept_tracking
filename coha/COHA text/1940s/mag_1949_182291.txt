Hollywood , which had neurotically exaggerated its economic doldrums ( TIME , Dec. 27 ) , was startled last week to find its new-found optimism dramatized at last . For the first time in eleven years , M-G-M summoned 81 of its far-flung sales executives to hear the good news straight from the front office : the company , which released 24 pictures last year , was going to turn out an imposing total of 67 in the next 12 to 15 months . <P> The big plan was the work of aggressive , able Dore Schary , 43 , MGM 's new vice president in charge of production . Of the projected 67 films , a dozen are already in the can and six are now shooting . The program will " challenge the gloomy prophets of defeat , " said Schary , who is being privately hailed by his studio head , Louis B. Mayer , as the long-sought successor to the late Irving Thalberg . There are still " tough problems to be solved , " Schary told the visiting salesmen , as they gathered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky ( left over from an old Esther Williams picture ) . But " no company fearing disaster could plan what we have planned . " <P> What surprised oldtimers as much as the ambitious total was the content of the projected films . The studio which , before Schary , had rarely put into its pictures anything more controversial than Lassie and Ma Hardy 's apple pies , was now courting social themes : Intruder in the Dust ( about the Negro problem ) ; Border Incident ( about Mexican laborers who enter the U.S. illegally ) ; an antitotalitarian story ; a script about an American Indian ( Robert Taylor ) trying to adapt himself to modern society . <P> Conventional M-G-M also grabbed some of the most unconventional talent in the business : there would be a Preston Sturges original for Clark Gable , a comedy by Garson Kanin , and Quo Vadis ? , a mammoth epic to be shot in Italy by John Huston . But there were also plenty of safe , sumptuous projects along the more familiar M-G-Model , e.g. , Annie Get Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miniver , and what was described as an " adult " love story for Lana Turner .
