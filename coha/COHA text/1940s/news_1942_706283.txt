txt Calling for an end to disputes and to " buck-passing " in armaments output , Donald M. Nelson , war production chief , tonight told American workers and management that they have ten months left ? " only 301 days " ? in which to step up production to a point " where victory can come within our grasp . " The alternative , he warned , might well mean the end of freedom throughout the world for centuries to come . In his first radio talk since assuming the chairmanship of the War Production Board , Mr. Nelson strove to personalize the world conflict for workers and management . His talk , broadcast from station WMAL over the Blue Network , emphasized the importance of getting guns , tanks , planes and other supplies to American and Allied troops as fast as possible . Addressing himself to those working on machines , overseeing production lines or managing war production factories , he said that every individual who was in a position to do so and who was not giving " every single thing within your individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faster and in ever-increasing quantities was " in reality helping the Axis win the war . " Asks Non-Stop Operations It was essential that industrial machinery of the country be put on 168-hour-a-week operation , he said , if the head start which Germany and Japan had gained was to be matched . Existing machinery could turn out 25 per cent more goods if operated on the three-shift basis , Mr. Nelson asserted . " And right here I want to say that this is no sly scheme to speed up men and machines for profits ' sake , " he continued . " It is instead a job in which we all can take a hand , and share in its success . Out of it must come greater production per machine and much greater use of each machine not . operating . " We can not always wait for new ones . We must have full , threeshift operations of those we have . We can not be satisfied until we 've come as close as possible to the limit of 168 hours of work per machine per week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many have blamed Washington for delays in getting industry into fulltime production of armaments which are desperately needed . " My answer to each of them has been : What have YOU done about it yourself ? " Mr. Nelson asserted . " Almost without exception , every one of these people I have talked to feels the urge to do more , " he continued . " The trouble is not with their intentions . The trouble is rather too strong a tendency to pass the buck  --  to blame the other fellow . Work is slowed down , production is lost and the men in the fox holes with , the men in the Indies , our boys on land and sea and in the air are the first to suffer , and suffer death . " Suggests Shop Score-Boards Mr. Nelson revealed that he plans to bring production goals closer to men and management by assigning to primary producers production quotas based on the known capacity of a plant . To enable the individual workman to visualize his accomplishments , he said , plants were being asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which each schedule could be laid out , and each man could see the goals he was expected to achieve each day , Mr. Nelson said that he had written to the management and workers in plants engaged in primary war production asking them to set ur joint management-labor committees within each of the plants to run the production drive necessary to " the greatest production job in history " which was set by the President 's call for 60,000 combat planes , 45,000 tanks , 20 , - 000 anti-aircraft guns and 8,000 , - 000 tons of merchant ships . " In this production drive I am also asking the joint committees in each , plant to provide machinery whereby each man may submit ideas and suggestions for doing the job better , " he went on . " These ideas and suggestions will be studied each week by the committees . Those found sound will be forwarded to Washington . Our engineering staff will examine them . Those proved valuable will by available to other plants . Thus we tap the vast new reservoir of ideas , welding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Our Army and Navy have eyetem of commending merit of high order in the line of duty . There is also merit of a high order on the production line in this war . I have , therefore , proposed that the ' Production Soldier ' shall also be recognized for meritorious service to his country . Individuals making special contributions to greater production will , upon recommendation of the local plant committees and subject to review by a national board , be given awards of merit . " As part of his plan for giving workers a sustained and personal interest in their achievements , the production board chief revealed , he has arranged with the Army and Navy to give workers a report on the field performance of the ships , guns , tanks , airplanes and other things they produce . Tonight 's broadcast was the first of four weekly talks in which Mr. Nelson will undertake to answer the civilian 's question ; " What can I do to help win the war ? "            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
