Beyond Glory ( Paramount ) is a canonization of West Point and Model Cadet Alan Ladd . At the start Ladd is accused by an ex-plebe ( Conrad Janis ) of hazing beyond the line of duty , and of lying to bring about the plebe 's expulsion . As the story unravels in flashbacks , things look pretty black for the hero . Before he came to West Point he fought in World War II , and apparently his best friend died in battle because Ladd was a c-w-rd . And now Ladd is engaged to the poor fellow 's widow ( Donna Reed ) . But by the time the picture ends it is clear that Ladd never funked for an instant , handed out no more bullying at West Point than he took , never tells lies , and is in every way worthy of the Academy and of Miss Reed . <P> The story might have serialized nicely in the old American Boy . It is filmed ( much of it at West Point ) with romantic feeling for place and protocol , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and by Miss Reed , the screen 's All American Nice Girl . Most of the military people , however , are such Galahads , and most of the male civilians are such slobs , that ordinary men will probably slink out of the theater with their hats over their faces . <P> The Street with No Name ( 20th Century-Fox ) is still another of Fox 's well-made semi-documentaries ( Call Northside 777 , Boomerang ! , etc . ) . This time the story is based on FBI files . The subject : postwar gangsterism . <P> The juvenile delinquents of yesterday have become the gangsters of today , and they are much smarter and more dangerous , we are told , than the old gangs used to be . A disguised FBI agent ( Mark Stevens ) hangs around the hard streets of a large provincial city and gradually works his way into such a gang . His object : to identify those responsible for a chain of thefts and killings . <P> The gang 's leader is a pale , frail , lethal youth ( well played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " scientific " methods . ( Sample : he schemes to get the G-man knocked off , in the course of an apparent burglary , by the local police . ) His business associates are so young and fearsome that among them Mr. Stevens , no pantywaist , seems as mild and conspicuous as a country uncle . He makes himself still more conspicuous by the recklessly amateurish ways he keeps in touch with fellow agents ; they signal each other , for instance , with lights at fleabag windows . However , he stirs up a lot of dirt ( a high police official is involved ) , gets the necessary evidence , and funnels the picture into a climax in a dark factory , where a satisfying portion of hell breaks loose . <P> Street is a workmanlike , exciting show , but basically it does not seem different enough from a lot of crime fiction to be worth all the documentary bother . Semi-documentaries are verging , in fact , toward formula . If they are to realize their fine potentialities-or even stay as good as they started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not immediately fatal ; but it brings death to the door , and leaves the door on the latch .
