A decade ago a gloomy band of British socialists met in Edinburgh . The Ramsay MacDonald government had collapsed . Their movement was wasted by feuds , weighted by inertia ; socialism in Britain was moribund . Something had to be done . In desperation they decided to start a tuppenny weekly . To get it going , people like Stafford Cripps , Aneurin Bevan , Ellen Wilkinson , George Russell Strauss and John Strachey chipped in 10 apiece to buy stock . <P> Last week their Tribune was ten years old . None of its founders had ever seen a dividend check , but they counted their money and time well spent . The little ( circ. 20,000 ) journal had gradually won a place of influence in British politics and journalism out of all proportion to its circulation or bank balance . Though it ranked well below the Economist or the New Statesman , the Tribune was must reading in Fleet Street and the Ministries . <P> The Tribune survived its first days , as a militant " workingman 's weekly , " by changing its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art criticism , tripling its price and courting the " out-at-elbow middle class . " The phrase came from its prize , unpredictable Critic-Columnist George Orwell . <P> Fie on the Finns . Early in the Tribune 's career , it had narrowly escaped abduction by the Communists , while Cripps and Bevan were n't paying enough attention . Publisher Victor Gollancz , then a fellow traveler ( now safely home again ) , began sharing the deficits with Stafford Cripps in 1938 , and Konni Zilliacus , now a pro-Soviet M.P. , blossomed as the " Diplomatic Correspondent . " In 1940 , when the Tribune went so far as to accuse the Finns of aggression against Russia , Nye Bevan woke up and rushed to the rescue . <P> He has been the guiding spirit ever since . Today , as Health Minister , he can not exercise direct control , but remote control is good enough . Energetic Jennie Lee , his dark-haired wife , is a Tribune director , and many a friendly tea at their house could pass for an editorial conference . Other directors : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Patricia Strauss , wife of another founder who is now under secretary of transport . <P> During the war the Tribune was the one British weekly that felt free to criticize Churchill 's government , * managed to do it without ever opposing the war . <P> Victor 's Spoils . The election brought the socialist weekly an embarrassing wealth of ministerial connections , and at first it leaned over backward to avoid taking advantage of it . Then , says Jennie Lee , " we said ' the hell with it ' ; anything we got by our own efforts we 'd print , and that 's what we do now . " Now that they are breaking even , they pay their contributors a guinea a column . Says one editor : " It varies only for our really distinguished ones , who are allowed ( as H. G. Wells and G. B. Shaw were ) to write for nothing . "
