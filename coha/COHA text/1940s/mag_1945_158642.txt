Every year the Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A. ( 2,000,000 members ) elects a Moderator-a largely honorary but distinctly honorific post . In Minneapolis last week the church 's 157th annual assembly chose tall , grey , bespectacled William Blakeman Lampe , pastor of St. Louis ' big ( 1,500 members ) West Presbyterian Church . <P> Dr. Lampe describes himself as " the common garden variety Presbyterian preacher , " and on most issues is a middle-of-the-roader . But after his election ( on the second ballot ) , he made it clear that he saw eye to eye with his predecessor . Dr. Roy Ewing Vale , when it came to Roman Catholics in politics . " We are not fighting the Roman Catholics , " said he , " but we have always fought for our liberties , and we will continue to do so . "
