THE SWAMI AND DR . SCHULTZ A Story SEYMOLTR FREEDGOOD R EFUGEES from National Socialism have turned up in many unexpected places during the past ten years but none so strange , I think , as the Hindu city of Brindaban in western India . Located in the United Provinces close to the Rajput States , its 5,000 temples , monasteries , and shrines mark the legendary site of Lord Krishna 's revels with the cowgirls of that vicinity . With the exception of the Rev. Mr. Caldwell , a Christian missionary who operated a small school and hospital at Brindaban , there seemed little in its peculiar associations to attract a refugee from the West . When I learned from Mr. Caldwell that in addition to being a refugee , Dr. Schultz was a noted scholar , had indeed been an instructor in comparative religion at the University of Leipzig before coming out to India ten years ago , and was now living as a Hindu monk in Swami Bon 's monastery , I could hardly believe it . In such a refuge it seemed highly improbable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to meet Dr. Schultz , I must say that at the outset I restrained myself . I felt  --  although I may have been wrong in this  --  that if the German had gone to such lengths in his rejection of Western society , we should grant him his peace . Against the background of so absolute a withdrawal hewould at any rate take unkindly to a visit , no matter how cordial. from a sergeant in the American military police . But with this attitude , the Rev. Mr. Caldwell was in sharp disagreement . Since I was stationed at a nearby American air-base , it being my job at the time to escort parties of officer-tourists to the holy city , I often stopped by at the mission and we had frequently discussed the matter . According to the Christian missionary , Dr. Schultz stood to benefit from any type of Western influence . Having withdrawn to a Hindu monastery at a time when the Nazis had seemed triumphant everywhere , he might profit from a talk with one of the victorious Americans . This was 1946 and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the West . When I persisted in my refusal to meddle , my personal attitude toward the West being such that I could not in good conscience persuade anyone , and certainly not a German refugee , to risk his prospects on it , Mr. Caldwell resorted to subterfuge . I am still astonished at the cunning with which he brought our meeting about . It happened that a party I had been escorting through Brindaban had lingered so long among the ritual places that it was time for tea . Settling them in the Rev. Mr. Caldwell 's compound , I had hardly poured myself a cup when he launched Like Sergeant Baxter in this story , Seymour Freedgood was a sergeant in our Air Force in India , and greatly interested in the native life and religion . his attack . " I hope you enjoyed your day among the temples , " he said to my people . " Fantastic , are n't they ? Did you visit Dr. Schultz ? " I tried to catch his eye but he refused to be intimidated . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he explained to Miss Phillips , the Red Cross girl . " The one who 's been living with Swami Bon . " Miss Phillips perked up at once . " Sergeant Baxter never told us about them , " she said indignantly . The rest of my party was looking at me with surprise . " Who are Swami Bon and Dr. Schultz ? " " I did n't think you 'd be interested , " I said miserably . " Just a pair of old swamis . I 've never met them myself . " " Who said we were n't interested ? " demanded another member of the party , a major who had been paying court to the Red Cross girl all day . " Of course we 're interested . " " We 're intensely interested , " said Miss Phillips . " Mr. Caldwell , will you tell us what this is about ? " The missionary was happy to oblige . It appeared that Swami Bon , spiritual master of a leading monastery at Brindaban , had brought Dr. Schultz out from Germany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tour of Europe and America and had met Dr. Schultz at the University of Leipzig . National Socialism had long become oppressive to the German scholar . With the exception of a short stay at a British internment camp , he had been at the monastery at Brindaban ever since . When Miss Phillips inquired what a Hindu swami could have been doing on a lecture tour of Europe and America , Mr. Caldwell explained that Swami Bon was a person of distinguished reputation . A member of an old family of Bengali Brahmins , he was noted as a lecturer and interpreter of Hindu theology and had traveled much in the outside world . Miss Phillips also learned , to her manifest elation , that on one of his international lecture tours the Swami had visited east-coast America and had lectured at Columbia . Since she knew that I had once attended that university myself and for a time before the war had also studied at Leipzig , she smiled significantly . " Then Sergeant Baxter is just the person to take us , is n't he ? He 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mind I could already see her outlining a new series of Red Cross tours . " But it 's late , " I objected . " We 've got to get back to the base . " " You need n't stay long , " said the missionary . So surprised had I been by this sudden betrayal that I had almost forgotten its initiator . Mr. Caldwell , however , had a final shot in his bolt . " The fact is , they 're half expecting you . Dr. Schultz took some treatment at the clinic this morning and I told him that an American professor of philosophy , now enlisted in his country 's service .. . " " Damn it , Mr. Caldwell , " I said angrily , " you should n't have said that . You know I was never . . " " Imagine using such language to a minister , " remarked Miss Phillips . " Sergeant , shall we go ? " I decided to make the best of it . Since the decision was already made for me I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit the monastery myself . Taking leave of Mr. Caldwell , who assured me once again that Dr. Schultz would benefit , I joined Miss Phillips and our party and in dubious spirits drove off to see the monks . T HE road over which we now traveled was faced on each side by that diversity of architecture which gives Brindaban its national character . Side by side with pyramidal shrines from southern India stand the sandstone spires of Rajputana and the wattle huts of the eastern states . " That 's the Mohan temple now , " I said , pointing to the gateway and swelling dome of a red sandstone edifice . It was the oldest of the Krishna sites . " They live around here . " Although Miss Phillips was still excited , the rest of our party seemed half asleep . " Let 's stay just long enough to see the German , " I suggested . " Swami Bon is sure to be suspicious . " A sugar-cane press in a nearby field shrieked noisily as we pulled up in front of a low , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bougainvillaea at a neat concrete house . " Take over , sergeant , " said one of the officers . " You went to college with these PlaCato-I.OW THE SWAMI AND DR , SCHULTZ fellows . It 's your show . " A dark , slender man , his saffron robe draped elegantly across one shoulder , the lower end covering his body as far down as the knee , came hurrying across the garden path . " Welcome to our ashram , " he said , speaking very careful English . Even at this distance I could see that our uniformed presence had caused a spurt of activity on the verandah . Monks seemed running all about . " Is there anything I can do ? " " Your holiness , " I said , noting from the markings on his forehead , his costume , and the extreme sensitiveness of his face that he was a person of some ecclesiastical importance , " we are a party of Americans from the air depot at Chandrapore . We heard so much about Brindaban that we decided to come . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thaw a little . " Gentlemen , my name is Trivandi Swami B.H. Bon . I am the spiritual leader of this humble community . May I offer you the comforts of our house ? " Hastily I made the introductions , calling the Red Cross girl by name and then summoning the rest from the car . They were looking about them uncertainly . " Americans , " the Swami mused as he led me up the pathway , Miss Phillips and her officers trailing nervously at the rear . " I had the honor once to lecture at some universities of your country . But that was before the war . " " So I understand , " I said warily , uncertain yet as to where we did stand . His brother monks , I noted , seemed to have composed themselves and were now waiting to greet us on the porch . Though they were less elegantly dressed than their leader , I found an element of grace about them which in such tranquil surroundings was quite becoming . But of a European I could see no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Swami was saying . " I had the honor to lecture at them all . " " Do n't tell me you lectured at Columbia ! " cried the Red Cross girl , who was now walking between us , her arms linked in ours . " How absolutely marvelous ! Perhaps you 'll remember Sergeant Baxter , Swami . He went there too ! " " Did you ? " he was saying as we walked up the verandah steps . The delegation ofmonks came out to greet us , but since no one else appeared to speak English I thought further introductions unnecessary . Looking uneasily at Miss Phillips , the officers bowed and the monks prostrated themselves in answer . " Would you care to see our shrine ? " asked the Swami , and nervously my party admitted themselves into one of the cool , white rooms . They were gone less than five minutes but in that time I had come to terms with our host . " Your friends seem unhappy in our community , " said the Swami . He had escorted them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why did you bring them ? " I DECIDED to be truthful . " We were at tea with Mr. Caldwell when he told them about your German refugee . I took advantage of their interest to come over myself . " I paused and for a moment glanced hastily into the adjoining study . A fair-headed man of extreme emaciation , his face Teutonic in character but his body shrouded in a white toga , was standing huddled against the wall . " I understand you met him at the University of Leipzig , " I continued . Obviously the Swami had intercepted my glance . " It occurred to me that we might have mutual friends . " The swami was looking at me steadily . " Mr. Caldwell informed us you were coming . " It was evident from the way he said it that he and the Christian were rivals . " Exactly what is your business at Brindaban ? You 're not a missionary yourself ? " Again I could speak truthfully . " Certainly not , " I said . " I 'm a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in philosophy . If I want to engage you and Dr. Schultz in conversation , it 's because I 'm interested in Hindu life . " " I hope you can remember that , " the Swami said shortly . From inside the shrine room I could hear Miss Phillips talking loudly about some colored dolls . " Both Dr. Schultz and I would be happy to talk to you , " he continued . " But perhaps at another time ? My colleague is unused to Western society . " " Of course , " I said . " I understand perfectly . Thank you for the invitation . " My associates were now pouring out of the shrine room and I hurried over to join them . " Well ? " Miss Phillips whispered . " Did you get to see him ? " " I saw him , " I told her . " I 'm to come back . " " Oh , you should have seen the pretty doll house , " Miss Phillips said loudly . " Who lives in the pretty doll house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Please come again , " he said to me as we were climbing back into the car . " Dr. Schultz will be anxious to talk . " O NCE launched on my attack on the monastery I found it hard to withdraw . Not only was there pressure from Mr. Caldwell , whose interest in Dr. Schultz was evangelical , and who was able to give my blunt curiosity a respectable cloak ; there was also pressure from the monks themselves . It was my impression that Dr. Schultz , worried in his own mind about his future , was anxious to justify his conversion in the eyes of one whom he considered a visiting scholar , and that in this project he was getting encouragement from Swami Bon . It also occurs to me that they may have been interested in making converts themselves . At any rate I soon after had a letter from them , addressed to Professor Charles Baxter ( Staff Sergeant ) , U. S. Armed Forces , Chandrapore . In it they again urged me to come down . Although I blushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caldwell was responsible  --  I decided to take advantage of it . " Professor " seemed so much better than " sergeant " in this sort of enterprise . Taking still another hitch in my conscience , I resolved to go ahead . On the day of our appointed meeting I drove over to Brindaban in my own vehicle . As I swung up to the monastery , clouds of dust announcing my arrival , they were already at the garden gate . " This is my colleague , Dr. Schultz , " Swami Bon said after I had greeted him . " We are so glad you could come . " I offered my hand to the tall , emaciated European but instead of grasping it he replied in the Hindu fashion , putting his palms together in front of his face and then bowing with the upper half of his body . Except for a difference of color , his robe being white while his mentor 's was saffron , he and the Swami were dressed exactly alike . Their tonsures also were similar , the skulls of both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crown . But the similarity ended at their faces ; not only was the Swami 's clear mahogany in color , Dr. Schultz 's deathly white , but there was a skeletal difference also , the Hindu having the delicate cheek bones and elongated jaw of the Bengali Brahmin , the European having short , curt features ( now softened by contemplation and suffering ) of the sort that we associate with members of the German General Staff . " Professor , " he said with a slight Teutonic guttural , " I am so sorry I could not greet you last time . I was a little upset . " " I can believe it , " I said readily . " Even the strongest people get upset by American Red Cross tours . I was upset myself . " We were being preceded up the garden path by four or five neophytes , all of them grinning and prancing with nervousness . At a gesture from Swami Bun they scuttled up the cottage stairs , crossed the white verandah , and opened the door next to the shrine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two hosts into the study where I had first seen the German cowering the time before . We arranged ourselves on chairs . Posted as I was , facing them and tilted back against one of the bookcases , I considered my opponents as they were seated , shoulder to shoulder , across the wide desk . They were definitely a united front and I felt very much the intruder . " I hardly know where to begin , " said the Swami after we had chatted a few moments , discussing mutual friends at Columbia . " It 's so long since we had a visitor from the West . " " You might tell me a little about Brindaban , " I suggested . " I 'm interested in your religious life . " My two friends leaned forward . " You are familiar with Sri Chaitanya and the neo-Krishna revival ? " asked Swami Bon . Vigorously I shook my head . " Brindaban , " said the Swami , beginning to relax a little , " has the same importance in Hindu culture as Bethlehem or Nazareth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the seat of a religious revival which began in Bengal in the sixteenth century and has since attained national scope . Again like primitive Christianity , its aim is to lay spiritual foundations for a new type of social life . " " But what 's that to do with you ? " I asked the German . " How did you ever get here ? " The answer was reasonable enough . Dr. Schultz , it appeared , had a double purpose in mind when in 1936 he had decided to escape his Western commitments by accompanying Swami Bon to India . If National Socialism had long been abhorrent to him , so was the whole body of Christian dogma against which National Socialism was a protest . it was his demand for a new theory of God as well as his rejection of European systems of politics which had caused him to abandon his Western background for something quite other in the East . " And what is this other baCkground ? " I think I must have already known the answer . " The answer you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It is the result of my long investigation , dear professor , that in our search for the ultimate godhead we must seek a level anterior to Christ . You are aware of the Hindu tenet , that life is meaningful only through the proper enunciation of the divine name ? Every word of any language , any sound in the world , must have its origin in the original word , the transcendental name of the godhead whom we call Lord Krishna . It is to this concept that I am devoting my life . " Even if I had agreed with the man I would have winced at his vehemence . Actually I had not intended to discuss theology at all . What I really wanted to know was why Dr. Schultz had not come to the United States . But now I could see I was in for it . " St. John affirmed much the same thing in the Gospel , " Swami Bon suggested . " in the beginning was the word , and the word was made flesh , and the flesh was Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It is because we know these ideas are unfamiliar that we have asked you to Brindaban , " Swami Bon continued , and expounded to me at length the Hindu notions of the godhead . " As a representative of a Western culture , " he concluded , " it is our hope that you will see the light . What are you doing tomorrow , professor ? Dr. Schultz and I would like to escort you through the interior of our religious district . In the region outside Brindaban there are some hermitages dedicated to Krishna . Would you care to go ? " " I 'd love it , " I said . So eager was I to avoid further discussion that I would have agreed to anything . " I 'll call for you early in my jeep . " " Excellent , " said Swami Bon . " And now it is time for our afternoon devotions . I do n't believe you 've had the opportunity to visit our shrine room ? " W E LEFT the study and crossed the verandah , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their prayer beads . The antechamber to the shrine room was almost bare ; I saw only a shrouded bust in one of the corners and some conch shells and an elongated , two-headed drum hanging from one of the whitewashed walls . But through the small doorway at the other end I was able to see the furnishings of the shrine . " Lord Krishna and his divine spouse , Sri Rhadha , " Dr. Schultz said in a hushed voice . He pointed to a pair of lavishly dressed dolls , about two feet in height , which were seated in a bower of flowers . I looked closer and identified the pair ; I also noted that the traditional flute , which in all idols of Krishna is poised between his lifted hands , was missing . " Beside them on the flowery throne is Sri Chaitanya , the sixteenth century founder of our order . " The third doll was seated on the pillow with the divine figures . In addition to its gorgeous clothing I noted a pair of gold spectacles on its nose . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I asked , staring in the meantime at a tiny bedstead , its sixteenth century curtains rolled halfway down on all four sides . It was standing just behind the bower , against a wall of the room . " Food for the gods , " Swami Bon explained . " While Sri Chaitanya and the divine spouse sit in waiting , Lord Krishna enjoys his afternoon siesta . Soon we will waken and offer him food . " " It is an example of the anterior type of worship to which I just referred , " Dr. Schultz broke in . " The erotic principles and unalloyed devotion practiced by this order reach their climax in the ' love of separation of Sri Rhadha , the divine spouse , for Lord Krishna . ' While the Lord sleeps tranquilly in the bedstead , Rhadha yearns for him on the couch . We are now about to reunite the divine pair . " I was having trouble following this explanation . " I do n't get it , " I said . " How could Lord Krishna be sleeping in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the couch . " " Lord Krishna is enjoying a vicarious slumber , " Swami Bon said imperturbably . " The bedstead is unfortunately too small to accommodate his divine person . To enable the Lord to enjoy his slumber , we put the flute in his stead . " I looked closer and realized that the sole occupant of the bedchamber was Lord Krishna 's flute . " And now we will waken his majesty , " said Dr. Schultz . He led me back to the anteroom , stationed me next to the bust in the far corner , and proceeded to remove the shroud . It was a statue of Sri Chaitanya , I now realized , with the self-same gold spectacles as the effigy inside . wedged myself behind it and waited . Now bare-footed and loin-clothed monks , the marks of their calling scrawled in gray paste on their breasts and foreheads , were pouring into the room . Swami Bon stepped over to the wall and removed the elongated drum . He tapped a few times on its vibrant surfaces , swung the instrument around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air . From somewhere upstairs the clamor of bells marked the beginning of the service . With the iron crescendo rising quickly and filling the room , two acolytes grabbed the conch shells and rushed into the shrine room , where they began to pray . Again to the clamor of bells I saw a long feather plume being waved up and down before the bower . Another monk rushed forward , prostrated all thirteen points of his body in complete abnegation , and then removed the flute from the bedstead and returned it to Lord Krishna 's hands . As Swami Bon MAGAZINE whirled and drummed in the middle of the shrine room , food was offered to the gods and vicariously they ate . Involuntarily I crossed myself  --  and was about to escape when my eyes returned to the German . He seemed lost to the world entirely , overwhelmed and absorbed by the symbols of service , the shouts , the ringing , the drums , and the shriek of the conch shells . At last I understood what he was doing . Two tiny cymbals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and down in a jackknife motion , Dr. Schultz was dancing and playing for the gods . I ducked out to the verandah . What I wanted most at the moment was a cigarette and I lit one hurriedly . After taking a couple of puffs I threw it away and made the distance across the garden to my vehicle . As I turned on the ignition I heard someone call from the verandah . It was Dr. Schultz , tall and specterlike in his white shroud . " Professor , " he was calling . " Yes , Dr. Schultz , " I called back . " Professor , do n't forget our trip to-morrow . " " I wo n't forget , " I promised him . Still trembling , I lit another cigarette and took off in the car . LTHOUGH Mr. Caldwell seemed amused by my account of my visit , I think he was a little worried . Acting as he was by proxy against his archenemy , Swami Bon , for the return of the refugee , it was no part of his project to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know but that for an interval , at any rate , he was in danger of doing so . Certainly it would not have been the first time that a man had attempted the role of devil 's advocate , only to be converted himself . The truth is , I had become enormously fascinated by the monks at Brindaban ; and if a number of unforeseen tensions between Dr. Schultz and the Swami had not revealed themselves the next day , I might have been converted myself . Perhaps it was the glory of the weather ? together with a sense of relief that I was escaping , no matter how temporarily , from the crowded monotonies of Army life  --  that contributed to my unusual susceptibility to what I was about to see that next day . India that February was enjoying its most perfect temperatures ; the mildness of its sky and the bright winter foliage gave it everywhere a Mediterranean air . Against such a background it did not seem strange to be visiting an isolated Asiatic hermitage in the company of two such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monastery servants and I was looking forward to an agreeable picnic . There was , however , one slight indication of trouble . " I brought along a camera , " I told Dr. Schultz and the Swami as I picked them up at the monastery gate that morning . " Our friends at Columbia might be interested in photographs . Is that all right ? " They had been stumbling against each other for almost two minutes before I understood why neither had answered my question . Each was vying with the other to get the front seat of the jeep . I had to smile as they fenced with each other . " After you , Bon Maharaj , " Dr. Schultz said courteously , attempting to hand his colleague into the rear of the vehicle . But Swami Bon would have none of it . " I think I should ride up front with the professor , " he said firmly . " After all , I know the country best . " This controversy , less thinly veiled than I might have wished , continued all morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was he the senior member of the party and in a sense the representative of the country and its only true guide , but also , I felt , it was his turn to show off . Yesterday it had been the German who had kept the conversation moving . I thought it no more than proper for the Hindu to have an opportunity to exhibit his spiritual life . In this verdict , I am sorry to say , Dr. Schultz did not share . From his seat in the rear of the jeep he kept up an endless chatter . " But Bon Maharaj , " I can still hear him saying , " did n't we pass the sidetrack to Gobberdam five miles back ? " Swami Bon ignored him . " Keep driving , professor , " he urged me . " The road to Gobberdam is five miles ahead . " The hermitage of Gobberdam presents a salient point of reference in the miles of pilgrim track which surround the holy city of Brindaban . Although the adjacentcountryside is all sacred to the life and revels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly Bengal , coming each year to renew the ecstatic stations of their Lord , Gobberdam is of particular importance . In addition to its theological aura it has a patriotic significance , the first Bengali monks having migrated to the site when the neo-Krishna revival was reaching across India in the sixteenth century . A nationalist as well as a theologian , Swami Bon must have felt the force of this double tradition when he selected the hermitage for our inspection . As the Swami had assured me , the road to Gobberdam lay five miles ahead across a plain of bracken and sugar cane . Startled peasants looked up as the jeep bounced along ; when they saw the monks in the vehicle , their eyes must have bulged . These scattered audiences had a mixed effect on my hosts , Swami Bon staring straight ahead when we passed a group , Dr. Schultz nodding and smiling . The German seemed visibly to have blossomed in the jeep and was enormously enjoying what must have been his first ride in a motor vehicle in many years . " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Schultz was still nodding and smiling in the back seat . " There lies Gobberdam beyond that hillside . " " Where ? " I asked . From the road I could see nothing but an abandoned village , its mud-caked walls a ruin , crumbling across the hillside . " Is that all there is ? " " Beyond , " Swami Bon said impatiently . " The village is there for camouflage . Drive through the streets . " T HEN the miracle happened and we were in paradise . A grove of large trees covered the opposite hillside ; startling as it was in this arid country , the great stems and brave foliage were especially striking against the dun-colored ruin we had just penetrated . Off the shaded avenues and scattered around the great ritual tank which was the center of the oasis I noticed a number of small limestone structures which resembled igloos . " Tombs of the saints , " said Swami Bon . In these new surroundings his voice had taken on an added authority and it struck me for the first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The bodies of our sainted ones are not cremated , " he told me . " We bury them here . " By this time we had pulled up close to the ritual tank  --  large as a reservoir , it was , with wide stairs descending from the wooded slopes to the water level  --  and I parked the car . " Please remove your shoes before dismounting , " Swami Bon suggested as he got out of the jeep ! ' Dr. Schultz and I must pay our respects to the temple authorities . We 'll rejoin you in a moment . " Barefooted , my two shrouded friends padded off and I relaxed in the jeep . " That 's where the hermits must live , " I said to myself , looking down a row of thatched compounds . Each unit was surrounded by a briar fence ; inside I could see a cleared area , a , thatched cottage , and some cooking utensils , all of this blending into the nearby foliage . " I wonder what they do with themselves ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got out myself . For the first time in my Army experience I felt entirely alone . There was an absolute silence , a wonderful gravity among the trees that the occasional chirp of a bird seemed only to accentuate . Here nature and culture had blended to form a synthesis which I had often read about but never experienced . America , even the air depot at Chandrapore , seemed very far away . If at that moment a panther had emerged from the forest and slipped down the avenue of cottages , strolled briefly around the ritual tank , and then gone to sleep , I would have understood it perfectly . I felt in that Asiatic hermitage very close to the heart of the world . Together with these elevated thoughts I also experienced a twinge of conscience . What business had Mr. Caldwell to trifle with Dr. Schultz ? Already my alien presence was doing recognizable harm . Since early that morning I had noticed the breach between the Swami and our German ; the united front I had observed at the monastery was already splintered by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to play on the refugee 's nostalgia ? In that wonderful place I began to envy his position . I wanted to stay there myself . These considerations had hardly taken form in my mind when back down the MAGAZINE avenue of cottages came Dr. Schultz and the Swami , but this time accompanied by a crowd of pilgrims . There was much laughing and chattering in Bengali , a language I do not understand , but it was appar.ent that the visit of the Swami was a great occasion at the hermitage . The pilgrims were grouped about him as he walked , talking and snapping their fingers . " Professor , professor , " Dr. Schultz was calling . He had hurried ahead of the group to carry the news . I thought his voice sounded shrill . " We are being done a great honor . We are to visit a saint ! " I regretted the interruption ; in that excellent place I could have used more time for myself . " Tell me , " I said at random . " All those people around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It is a superstitious gesture , " Dr. Schultz said irritably . " Hermitages like these are always beset by demonic forces . They are chasing away giants . " I looked at the man but apparently he did not at first think his explanation odd . But then I noticed something else . In these elevated surroundings Dr. Schultz seemed to have lost in stature . If at the monastery he and the Swami had been colleagues , here he appeared almost as strange as myself . Judging from the irritation in his voice he must have felt this also . " Despite their piety these people have many ridiculous superstitions . Snapping their fingers ! " He sniffed . H is disengagement took a further turn when Swami Bon , taking his leave of the pilgrims , escorted us into one of the thatched compounds and introduced us to the hermit . At the moment Dr. Schultz seemed stirred . " This is a very great honor , dear professor , " he whispered as we squatted down to greet the aged ascetic . " In all my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Swami Bon was almost bursting with pleasure . It was apparent that I was impressed by Gobberdam . As a nationalist even more than as a theologian he was immensely pleased . " Would you care to photograph this ancient ? " he asked . " The professors at Columbia may be interested . Twenty-five years ago he retired to this compound . He has never come out . " I took out my camera and judiciously examined the hermit . Certainly the man was photogenic , with his passionate old face , his flaring nostrils , and his straight , naked body . " Tell him about the photographic process , " I suggested as Dr. Schultz leaned over to help me with the film pack . " If he 's been here for twenty-five years he could n't know much about cameras . " Swami Bon began to talk to the old man while the German helped me finish my preparations . When I looked up again I saw the Swami was smiling . " The hermit has a compliment for the two of you , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had already gone pale . Again I felt the wave of antagonism between them . " What is it ? " I asked . " The hermit has never before seen a Caucasian , " Swami Bon said gently . " He compliments you both on your beauty . He says you are handsome as angels . " The Swami turned and this time addressed the hermit in English . " Dr. Schultz is a convert to the Hindus , " he explained , enunciating very clearly for our benefit . " A man must not be deprived of salvation because he happens to be white . " I took my picture and we left the hermit and went back to the car . " It will be even more wonderful when India is liberated , " the Swami said hysterically . " It is only because of white domination that we must keep places like Gobberdam to ourselves . " " You will never manage it ! " Dr. Schultz said with sudden shrillness . " Professor , they will never manage it ! Thank God for white domination ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withdrew tomorrow , India would be a hell ! " " Gentlemen , gentlemen , " I said in desperation . " I 'm tired and hungry . Could n't we have lunch ? " B Y THE greatest good fortune my ap- peal to their hospitality was successful . Otherwise I hesitate to guess what might have happened . A fight in the hermitage itself ? Rigidly we entered the car and drove to the other side of the ritual tank , where a shady grove provided a convenient place for lunch . " The peopleat Union Theological will also be interested in my pictures , " I suggested , trying somehow to revive the conversation . " Do you know anyone at Union Theological , Dr. Schultz ? Anyone in particular to whom I might show the prints ? " " You might show them to the Rev. Dr. Code , " Swami Bon suggested . He seemed to have recovered from his fit of anger and was as gracious as before . " Why do n't you try this nut pudding . professor ? Meanwhile I will stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I asked , looking up in surprise . There seemed nothing inimical in the grove but a distant band of apes . " Against the monkeys , " Dr. Schultz explained . He too seemed to have recovered his humor . " They are as carefree as children , these monkeys . They are accustomed to being fed . " I relaxed on the ground and began to eat the nut pudding . It was very quiet in the grove and for a moment I recaptured the exalted sense I had experienced before . In this tranquillity my two friends seemed to co-operate ; chatting gently in Bengali they had taken up guard positions about ten feet away and with large sticks were threatening the distant monkeys . I had finished the nut pudding and was pouring myself a cup of water before I realized that the animals were moving in . Since the monks seemed unalarmed I continued eating . The beasts were all of twenty feet away . When next I looked up I thought I had been hit by an express train . A moment later I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the picnic lunch and with a glancing blow had knocked me flat on my back , ten others , had taken advantage of this diversionary action to elude the Swami and Dr. Schultz . The area was full of hairy , howling figures , each one attacking the lunch . Into this wild engagement my two friends plunged bravely with their clubs . I felt a stunning blow on the back of my neck . By the time they had cleared the field I had received quite a severe beating , but whether it was Dr. Schultz or the Swami who was responsible I still do not know . Each , I am sure , had sufficient provocation . Certainly I deserved what I got . But they were all commiseration once the monkeys had withdrawn from the field . " Professor , professor , " Swami Bon was murmuring as he helped me to my feet , " we are so sorry this has happened . Such an unexpected assault ! " " Yes , " said Dr. Schultz , who was also helping to brush off my clothes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He was breathing very heavily . " They are a most michievous folk . " I T WAS clearly as a test of his authority over the German that Swami Bon , a little later , accepted an invitation from me to visit the American air depot . The monks having turned up at Chandrapore to begin their annual begging tour of the large Indian cities , the ostensible reason for their visit was that I wanted to say goodby . I had just received my repatriation orders ; probably we would not meetagain . Yet there was no question in any of our minds as to my actual reason for inviting them . No European or American could have seen the air installation at Chandrapore without a thrill of recognition . If Dr. Schultz could withstand this final challenge , Swami Bon could have him . Mr. Caldwell to the contrary , he had found a home . In my own mind I was still uncertain of the outcome . Although I was very impressed by the way they had rallied at Gobberdam , I had sensed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , the German 's nostalgia for the society of his own kind . In the Chandrapore balance I determined to weigh these factors . If Dr. Schultz desired , I could still get him out . As I expected , Dr. Schultz was vastly excited by the airbase . Although it was al-ready six months since the Japanese had surrendered , the Americans still maintained considerable aircraft in India . The depot was a busy place . The hangars and shops were still in full operation and out on the flight strip I was able to point out aircraft which twice weekly were journeying from Asia to Europe and the United States . " Incredible , " he said dazedly . " It must be a wonderful age . " Even Swami Bon was affected by the great activity . " What will become of this equipment when the Americans evacuate ? " he inquired . We had been driving through the depot supply area , where tons of surplus equipment was going to waste . " The Government of India will get most of it , " I ventured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any of it yourself ? " " That remains to be seen , " he said dryly . I thought he might be worried by the effect of this technological display on the German , but he appeared to have himself in hand . " India will not become a great power until late in the century . We must use what we can . " " Incredible , incredible , " Dr. Schultz was still muttering . " From India to America in three days ! " . T HEN I played my trump . " And now , gentlemen , " I said after we had completed the rounds of the airbase , " I have a treat in store for you . After our delightful picnic at Gobberdam I feel / must return the favor . I 've arranged for us to lunch at the American Red Cross . " I watched for the effect of this announcement on the two of them . I was still sore from the drubbing I had taken at Gobberdam and had planned this luncheon in reprisal . " I 'm afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You must realize that Dr. Schultz and I must abide by our dietary restrictions . I do n't think . . . " " But Bon Maharaj l " the German began to protest before I could save him the bother . " I 'm aware of that , " I said as I pulled the car up in front of the Red Cross club . " Miss Phillips , the Red Cross lady whom you met at Brindaban , has been talking about you continually . She 's arranged a farewell luncheon for our benefit . We 're to dine on fruit . " In addition to a lounge , a library , and recreational rooms , the American Red Cross club at the airbase provided as pleasant a restaurant as any men 's club in the United States . Before Swami Bon could think of further objections I hurried them through a back entrance and into the private dining room . I had told Miss Phillips of my project and asked her to invite her assistants . It was my impression that I would need all the co-operation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When we entered their private dining hall I was delighted to find that they had prepared a most adequate lunch . Somehow they had also cleared the place of loungers . Being otherwise unoccupied , they were able to entertain my guests . They were especially dressed for the occasion and all three were positively radiant . Both the Swami and Dr. Schultz were touched . " Is n't it wonderful ? " said Miss Phillips , passing Dr. Schultz some fruit . We had all seated ourselves around a large table and were enjoying the lunch . " Sergeant Baxter has just received his orders . He 's returning to the United States ! " " And what are your postwar plans ? " Swami Bon inquired after they had all congratulated me . The gaiety and friendliness of the Red Cross girls had put him quite at ease . " I think I 'll fix up my tennis court , " I said idly . " Maybe write a book . " The bearer was coming up with our coffee and I turned to the German . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so attentively at the Red Cross girls that he appeared hardly to have heard me . " Coffee ? " he mumbled . " I 'm afraid not . It 's against our dietary regulations , " " You do n't mind if the rest of us have some , do you ? " I asked Swami Bon . He smiled and shook his head . " And what will you do when you finish your tennis court , professor ? " " Prepare for a third world war ? " I suggested . " It depends on how things go . " I had taken the coffee urn from the bearer and was deliberately filling the cups . " It looks like a century full of troubles . I 'm sure there 'll be enough to do . " The strong , sure odor of the coffee was already filling our nostrils . " And what about you , Swami Bon ? How long do you plan to be on your begging tour ? " " It may be some months , " he answered . " Dr. Schultz and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now that the war is over we need only raise the money . " " Bon Maharaj , " Dr. Schultz said shakily . There was something in his voice that attracted our attention . " Bon Maharaj , " he repeated , his eyes on the coffee urn , " I wonder if I could have a cup of coffee ? I have not had a cup of coffee since we left Berlin . " T ut Hindu had no choice . I could sec him make a quick calculation and then smile . " Certainly , Dr. Schultz , " he said easily , " take your cup of coffee . This is a very special occasion for my colleague , " he apologized as the German reached for a cup . It is not often that Dr. Schultz is entertained by Western friends . " I reached into my pocket and took out a cigarette . " Do you and Dr. Schultz intend to remain together indefinitely ? " 1 asked , in the meanwhile lighting the cigarette . I let a smoke ring drift in the direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the Swami said deliberately . " We did have our hearts set on a theological seminary . Much effort will be required to restore the society of the Hindus to its prior estate . " " Professor , " said Dr. Schultz . Under the influence of the coffee he again seemed visibly blossoming . " Professor , " he said , pouring himself a second cup , " when you return to New York , will you be visiting the Union Theological Seminary ? " " I 'll be going up to Columbia , " I admitted . " I could stop by at Union . " " I wonder if you could deliver a letter to one of my colleagues at the seminary ? Ten years ago we left Leipzig together . He has not heard from me since . " " I 'd be delighted , " I said , trying to mask my excitement . I put the cigarette on the table and reached for my fountain pen . " Here , " I said , restoring the cigarette to my mouth , " here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The German 's hands were trembling . " I think I would first like to smoke a cigarette , " he said unsteadily . " This is a very special occasion , professor . Will it be all right if I smoke ? " " That does it , " I thought , but already we had gone too far . Almost simultaneously the three Red Cross girls leaned forward with their cigarette cases but Swami Bon had anticipated them . " I 'm afraid that will be impossible , " he said abruptly . " Dr. Schultz is forbidden by the rules of our organization to indulge in cigarettes . You have already had your coffee , Herr Doktor . There will be no cigarettes . " " Forget the cigarettes ! " I said urgently . The Swami had risen from the table and was preparing to leave . " Here is the fountain pen , doctor . Write me the note . " As at Gobberdam when the hermit had complimented us , Dr. Schultz was turning very pale . When the Swami had spoken , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't take them away . " I 'm afraid this excitement has been too much for Dr. Schultz , " the Hindu said steadily . " In the century of troubles which you envision , dear professor , I think he will be more useful here . " I was willing to let it go at that . " But what about the letter to your colleague ? " / asked the German as I reseated them in the car . Since I was already on orders , I was unable to leave the airbase. had asked a Red Cross driver to take them to town . " Do you still plan to write the letter , Dr. Schultz ? " " Perhaps I 'll write it this evening , " the refugee said pitifully . " I 'll think about it and write it this evening . You will get it before you leave . " He looked at Swami Bon , who was staring straight ahead in the jeep . " It has been a delightful excursion . " " So it has , " said the Swami @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war is over , dear professor , you must come again . " " I 'll try , " I said . " I 'll certainly try . " I smiled at them both and waved as they were driven away . The next day before proceeding to my port of embarkation I checked the mails very carefully . At Calcutta , where I had to wait a month for passage , and even later , when I had already returned to America . I would say to myself each morning , " Today he will write the letter . " But he never did .
