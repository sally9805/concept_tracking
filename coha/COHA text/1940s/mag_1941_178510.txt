( See Cover ) To the U.S. Navy , last week 's tension was like a tonic . Even with half its battle fleet in the Atlantic , its timbers shivered with pleasure at the prospect of action instead of tension in the Pacific . Its officers were confident of putting up a good show and none more so than the wiry little man who , if &; when hostilities start , will be at the point of contact . His name : Admiral Thomas Charles ( " Tommy " ) Hart , Commander in Chief of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet . <P> Indispensable Oldster . When Special Envoy Saburo Kurusu paused at Manila on his way to Washington last week , he paid his respects to Tommy Hart . Murmured he : " It is my business to keep the Admiral idle . " The Admiral , weathered , wrinkled , tough as a winter apple , smiled broadly . As full of energy as a boy , he is far happier when he is bouncing around on inspection tours aboard his tooth-shaking , 245-foot yacht The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manila 's Mars-man Building , overlooking the Bay where most of his fleet anchors . According to precedent , he should have bowed out of the Navy five months ago . But when he reached the age limit of 64 , Franklin Roosevelt decided that Tommy Hart was indispensable in the East . <P> Last week thunderheads were gathering all over Tommy Hart 's Orient . U.S. Marines were ordered to abandon Shanghai , other Chinese stations-lest they be massacred when war came ( see p. 29 ) . Australian troops swarmed into Singapore and Canadian troops into Hong Kong in preparation for new Japanese aggression . And at bases from Sydney to Manila , British , Dutch and U.S. ships prepared for action . Already U.S. Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox had trumpeted : " The hour of decision is here . " Tommy Hart was the man for that hour . <P> He is no glib , soft-spoken naval diplomat . He has a salty tongue and a predilection for blunt truths . In periodic get-togethers with Lieut . General Douglas MacArthur , * who commands the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and British officers , he usually says little . He prefers action . Tommy Hart will be ready to shoot . <P> He has always been forthright in his tactics . In Shanghai in 1940 , when British and Italian Marines began to brawl , Tommy Hart did n't wait to consult the Japanese Admiral , who regarded the settlement as his preserve . He went to work on the British and Italian commanders , within a few hours had a twelve-man inter-allied patrol keeping peace throughout Shanghai . The patrol was made up of four Seaforth Highlanders , four Italian Marines , four U.S. Navy men , who were tactfully planted in the middle of the group . <P> Back in the ' 20s , when he was captain in command of the battleship Mississippi , Tommy Hart was just as independent as he is today . Once , while leading eleven other battleships in a pea-soup fog , he heard a destroyer 's warning siren , somewhere off his bow . Promptly , without consulting his fleet commander , he ordered the line to stop . Hauled up on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If I could n't see , how the hell could the flagship at the end of the line ? " He was officially rebuked , unofficially applauded .
