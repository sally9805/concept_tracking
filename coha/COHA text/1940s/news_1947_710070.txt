txt CITY-WIDE HUNT ON Warden Lays Break to Shortage of Guards in Old Jail BAR ON WINDOW SAWED Prisoners Believed to Have Had Outside Help  --  All Feigned Illness to Aid Flight By MEYER BERGER Nine prisoners , one a murderer and another an Alcatraz alumnus , broke out of the City Prison in lower Brooklyn yesterday . They escaped , while on sick call , through one of the prison 's ancient windows . Late last night all still were at large . Police Commissioner Arthur W. Wallander , who alerted his entire force of 17,000 men , with grim warnings to " be prepared to shoot , " ordered a city-wide search for the fugitives . The window through which the men fled is set in the prison 's east wall , separated by a twelve-foot moat from a police booth that looks down upon it . Patrolman Thomas Egan , assigned to the booth , did not see the fleeing prisoners . " Patrolman Egan happened to be shoveling one of the paths ini Fort Greene Park at the time , " his commanding officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in the park . Thomas , the prison warden , laid the escape to an inadequate number of guards and keepers , and to the prison 's deterioration . Parts of the institution are 108 years old . Complained a Week Ago " The jail , " the warden said , " is over 100 years old . Its bars are rotten , its windows are rotten , so what was I going to do about it ? " He said he had complained a week ago to Miles , district attorney for Kings County , that he needed more men ; that he had begged the Budget Director , ten days ago , for at least thirty additional guards . The warden said he had found no indication that the break was in any way tied up with corruption of his prison staff . This statement was borne out by Mr. . He pointed out that on Dec. 31 he had written to Albert Williams , the new Correction Commissioner , of the prison 's poor condition and inadequate personnel . This communication said , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causing me considerable concern . I feel * * * that you should be apprised of the present condition * * * and of the small amount of personnel which are assigned to this institution . " Toward its close Mr. 's letter carried this prophetic pas-sage : " ? / feel if a break were attempted , particularly during the night hours , a very dangerous condition would result . " After touring the prison yesterday with Police Commissioner Wallender , Mr. and the warden , Mr. Williams seemed inclined to agree that the institution was undermanned and generally in poor shape . Throughout his investigation he kept shaking his head at what he encountered . Mr. Williams , incidentally , has been Correction Commissioner only four days . The City prison , a dark gray stone-block edifice , four stories high , faces on Ashland Place . Its east wall , set with tall cathedral windows , all barred and grated , comes within twelve feet of Fort Greene Park 's west wall . Separating park and prison walls is a kind of dry moat roughly twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some places with institutional debris ? rusty cans , fence parts , stanchions . These were snow covered . Extending from one of the prison 's east windows , to the park wail , were long sections of planking . The planks made a crude sort of scaffolding , or shoring , placed there to bolster the sagging park wall . The nine prisoners used this // planking as a bridge across the moat . It saved them a drop to the ground . Investigators were not certain , but it seemed likely that the same scaffolding or planking might have been a platform from which anions of the prisoners , sawed away one of the one deleted 2 lines Sawed clean near the top , this bar was bent outward and downward , away from the prison wall . It was still in this position when the investigators viewed it . The fact that the bar was bent outward , rather than cut at the bottom , seemed further proof that the nine fugitives had help from the outside . It would have been almost impossible , detectives figured , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside the window . After a scrutiny of the sawed ends of the . bars , Mr. deleted 5 lines from above the window . The hacksaw marks were fresh and clean , the investigators noted , leading to the belief that the ba had been cut a few hours before the prison break . " A good man with a hacksaw could have gone through that bar in two minutes , " the Warden said . Experiment on a section of window bar exactly like the one sawed through for the escape , established that a hacksaw could ea through it in eight minutes , Mr. Wallander announced last night . In the number of prisoners delivered , the break would rate as the largest in city prison history . However , the delivery was astonishingly quiet . It involved no violence ; not so much as even a rude push at a guard . At 12:40 P. M. a score or more of the prison 's 487 inmates , put in for " sick call . " A certain numI : ) er of these was legitimate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roll by pleading minor ailments  --  headache , cold , body pains . John Moriarty , one of the keepers , led the sick and the malingerers to the ' doctor 's rooms on the prison 's lower tier . Warden , could spare no more guards for this detail . Of his total of fifty-three men , he had only twenty-eight on duty to handle the entire jail population . Prison Is Rectangular The prison is rectangular in shape , running 200 feet from north to south . A marble-floored corridor about fifteen feet wide runs through the prison 's length . Set in the dome , seventy feet above the street , are skylights . The central corridor rises on both sides to a height of five tiers ? long rows of cells , strongly barred , each with cot and toilet facilities for an inmate ; each feebly lighted by a ceiling lamp . The ends of this corridor are sealed off by steel gates . Just inside the south gate are the doctor 's cells , used as a clinic . Keeper Moriarty led the sick-call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one by one , a few in groups . As they were treated they were turned out again , and sent back to their cells . The keeper assumed , at least , that all the men followed this routine . All did , except the nine bent on escaping . They walked out of the south corridor gate , about twenty feet to the prison 's east wall . This part of the prison is isolated deleted 3 lines twenty-five feet wide , with the tan-painted and pale-brick walk rising about sixty feet . Set in this wall are two windows , about four feet wide , built in the style of Gothic cathedral windows . The inside sills , of stone , slope toward the floor , and the sills are set about twelve feet from the floor . The windows rise in series , one above another , to the ceiling . They are controlled by a gear and shaft device , similar to the crank-operated gear and shaft lift for store deleted 7 lines opening at the top . The prisoners got footing on the ? gear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor . Once on this housing , they could reach another six feet , or so , to the escape window . Getting out was not too easy . Removal of the single bar left an opening of only twelve inches by eighteen inches . They wriggled through this , one at a time . The planks for the parkwall shoring were at window-sill level . Whether they climbed these planks to the park-wall studding and escaped into the park , or whether they climbed down into the moat was not certain . If they shinned up the wall studding they could have reached the top of the park wall  --  a climb of about fifteen feet . Here they had another climb , a steel picket fence about eight feet high . This avenue , however , led them within ten feet of Patrolman Egan 's booth . Detectives seemed disinclined to think they got out past the booth and through the park , which was all open space . It would have been simple to track them that way . Later , when Mr. Wallander came to study the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the warden that the gear crank handle was still in the prison ; that the crank could not have been used in the escape . " Would they need that crank to turn the shaft to open the window ? " Mr. Wallanter asked . The Warden said he had never seen the windows opened by any other method . To his astonishment , and to the astonishment of other official observers , the Police Commissioner walked to the shaft , fixed his strong fingers around it and manipulated the shaft with comparative ease . " Could have done it without that crank handle , " he murmured , and stepped back . The investigators figured that the fugitives could have climbed down into the moat . In this ditch they could have run for any of the lower walls around the prison ? one nearest Brooklyn Hospital on the south seemed the safest for them . None of the men had his coat , hat or overcoat , having left these garments in his cell . Mr. found no hacksaw , or any part of one , either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Visitors Were Admitted He conceded the men had received packages yesterday morning . Visitors were admitted to the prison between 9 A. M. and 11 A. M. It seemed more than likely , the police thought , that one of these visitors announced the outside bar had been sawed and that the way to freedom was open . Not only had the bar been sawed , but a heavy steel - wire grating spread between the bars and the window , had been kicked inward . It lay against the open window . The men had climbed out over it . Last night it developed that this wire grating had shown signs of weakness on Dec. 26 . The clips , or studs , that held it to the window frame had been found loose , and a prison employe had refastened them . The nine fugitives had about a half-hour 's start before the alarm was sounded . At 1:15 P. M. , as other prisoners were being turned out of their cells for the afternoon walk , or exercise period , Herman J. Ruthaza , a deputy warden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who had pleaded ) guilty to murder , second degree , after a fatal shooting in a dice game , had gone out with the sick party . Mr. Ruthaza , checking him in " South 5 , " in the cell block , found his cell empty . Shuffling in the main corridor under the sickly yellow light of overhanging shaded electric lights , the other prisoners knew nothing of the escape , or the alarm . If they did , they kept quiet . They withheld their boo-ing until investigating groups came through later . Mr. , notified at once of Aiello 's disappearance , ordered a quick all-around check . The total number of missing came to nine . The afternoon walk for prisoners was canceled . The men were locked in their cells again , and guards and keepers scurried through the prison cellar , through the laundry , the sterilizing chambers , property lofts , seeking the fugitives . Mr. also had asked that an immediate alarm for the nine missing men , with full descriptions , be telephoned to Police Headquarters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of patrolmen , some armed with riot guns , some with tear gas , were thrown around the gray old institution . Detectives scattered through the miserable dwellings in the surrounding " jungle "  --  the downtown Brooklyn slums , near Manhattan Bridge , that surround the jail . They found no sign of the nine . Detectives seemed to be certain that Minutolo was behind the break . His previous record indicated an ingenuity in planning escapes . At 10 o'clock last night Mr. Wallander , Mr. Williams and Joseph Hoey , assistant district attorney , made a tour of the outside walls by electric torch light . Then the commissioners , three men from District Attorney 's staff and Mr. Williams and his aides began to question prison inmates . They were interested chiefly in men who were in position , either from the doctor 's office at sick-call or from their cells , to have witnessed the escape . " We 're going to talk to more than fifty of these prisoners , " Mr. Hoey said , " and we 're going to examine the packages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
