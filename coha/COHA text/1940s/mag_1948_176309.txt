Soviet Marshal Klimenti ( the " Liberator of Budapest " ) Voroshilov is something of a connoisseur of art , as generals go . In the summer of 1946 , when Hungary was looking for somebody to commemorate its " liberation " with a giant monument , Voroshilov found the man on the spot . On a stroll through a Budapest park , he had seen and admired a sculpture by Sigismund de Strobl . Voroshilov dropped in at De Strobl 's studio on newly named Voroshilov Avenue , found the sculptor quite willing to do the job . But De Strobl would have nothing to do with the proposed designs , which called for a Greek temple . " Design what you like , " said Voroshilov grandly . " You 're the artist . " <P> One day Voroshilov picked up De Strobl in his limousine , took him to the top of rocky Gellert Hill , which overlooks the city , the Danube , and the broad Hungarian plain . Said he : " This is where we will put our monument . " With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The result , which cast its shadow over Budapest last week , was probably far superior to the pink marble monuments the Reds have been building in Berlin , and certainly surpassed the obelisks , as characterless as paperweights , with which they have dotted Eastern Europe in the past two years . Instead of a tank , or a bust of Stalin , it featured a high-breasted , neoclassic lady holding a king-size palm leaf 42 feet above her bare bronze toes . <P> <P> Upstairs &; Downstairs . Members of the U.S. colony in Budapest have dubbed the statue " the Tobacco Auctioneer . " Hungarians say she holds the victory palm aloft because the grim , 18-ft. figure of a Russian soldier that stands below her on the pedestal might steal it . But these cracks fail to bother De Strobl . " The figure upstairs , " he explains , " is international . The figure downstairs is Russian . Many Russians lost their lives here , after all . " <P> At 64 , De Strobl has designed some 30 monuments , modeled innumerable portrait busts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . A diplomatic fellow , who gets along with the Russians without antagonizing too much those who do n't , he returned last year from a month 's visit to England and immediately accepted an invitation to tour Russia . George Bernard Shaw , whom De Strobl once " busted , " neatly ticketed the sculptor 's somewhat bland art when he described the portrait of himself as being " what I should like to look like . Perhaps I shall some day , if I contemplate it with sufficient intensity . " <P> Model No. 50 . De Strobl used no model for the woman in the Budapest monument ( " She came directly from my stomach , as we say in Hungary " ) , but the Russian below her was modeled from a Red Army trooper-the 50th model that Voroshilov had sent around for approval . <P> Says De Strobl , " I like my monument . I have done many things in my life and many of them I dislike after a few months , but this one I keep coming back to see . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was indeed complex , harmonious , and impressive . Even so , Hungarians who look forward to a " second liberation " can hardly wait to topple it into the Danube .
