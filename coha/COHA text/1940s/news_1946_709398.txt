txt ALBANY , April ** consideration is being given by leaders of American Federation of Labor unions to an endorsement of Governor Dewey if he becomes , as everyone expects , a candidate for re-election this fall . One result of such action would be a test of the relative political strength of the ' AFL and the Congress of Industrial Organizations in this State . A proposal that the federation go on record in favor of Governor Dewey 's re-election is almost . certain to be presented at this year 's State federation convention , which will be held in Rochester April 19 to 22 . Whether it will be approved may depend in large measure upon the stand taken by David Dubinsky , president of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union , and whether he wages a vigorous fight against endorsement if he opposes it . Leaders of State federation unions are now convinced that Senator James M. Mead will be the Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner . Democratic candidate for Governor . Even though they have endorsed Mr. Mead in the past when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AFL leaders believe they should throw their support to Mr. Dewey this year . One of the main reasons for this attitude is the feeling among AFL , union officials that their organization would be forced to play second fiddle to the CIO if Senator Mead should be elected . He has been wooing support from the CIO1 and its Political Action Committee.1 in recent speeches . To win , Senator Mead or any other Democratic candidate , probH ably would have to receive the ' backing of the American Labor party and the CIO , which not only provides the backbone of the ALP membership . but is the main source of its campaign funds . On the other hand , should Governor Dewey be re-elected with  - -  -  // AFL support playing a determining role in the outcome , the political prestige of the AFL would be greatly enhanced and its officers could count on a sympathetic audience in the executive offices for their recommendations and problems . The current feeling that Mr. Dewey should be endorsed by the AFL is not likely to extend to his running mate for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidate , as many Democrats hope . Mr. Lehman was always sympathetic to the AFL when he was Governor , and , according to one AFL , leader , would be almost certain of getting the AFL endorsement for Senator if he ran . Republican Legislature Likely Another political consideration taken into account by AFL leaders is that the next Legislature probably will be controlled by the Republicans as was this one . Even if Mr. Dewey were defeated , the Federation , as a supporter , would have a strong claim for sympathetic consideration of its program . Republican legislative seats that became effective at the 1944 legislative elections make it almost impossible for the Democrats to get control of either branch of the Legislature . Under the previous apportionment , they had a fair chance to control the Senate when they had a strong candidate for Governor , but not the Assembly , which has had a Democratic majority only twice in the last fifty years . The Senate was under Democratic control during most of Governor Lehman 's administration . Governor Dewey is expected to demonstrate this week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in controversies between the AFL and CIO his sympathies will be found with the federation . At the time of their passage these bills were strongly supported . by the State federation and as strongly opposed by the CIO . One of their main purposes is to restrict newcomers in the barbering and beauty parlor field . With both the labor organizations threatening to make the votes on these measures a test for endorsements this fall the barbering licensing bill received the support of only two New York City Democrats in the Assembly . Although all but one of the up-State Democrats voted for it , the division reflected the fact that most up-State barbers are members of the AFL while in New York they belong to CIO unions . The Senate test was made not on the barber bill but on the hair dressing bill . There , virtually the same division occurred . A number of other factors are also being taken into account , among them the jobs that will be provided for members of the AFL construction trades unions through the big public works program that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The construction trades unions are the largest single component of the AFL membership in New York State .
