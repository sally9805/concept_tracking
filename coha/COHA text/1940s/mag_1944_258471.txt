Fierce-browed Admiral William Frederick Halsey , one of the U.S. Navy 's fightingest admirals was just about out of a job . At his advance headquarters in a Solomons jungle last week , correspondents were called in , given the tip-off that his work in the South Pacific was about over . When " Bull " Halsey , once famed Annapolis fullback ( 1902-3 ) , took over the South Pacific command in October 1942 , the Marines on Guadalcanal were in trouble . Halsey waded right in . <P> With shrewd use of small forces , he outmaneuvered and outfought the Japanese , pushed them back toward Rabaul where they would be crushed under the bombs of MacArthur 's Fifth Air Force as well as Halsey 's own varied airfleets . <P> With last month 's bypassing of Rabaul and capture of the St. Matthias Islands , Halsey reached the end of his road . Above his area the commands of Nimitz and MacArthur ( under both of whom he had worked ) had joined . Next job for " Bull " Halsey , one of only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a layman 's guess . A good bet : it will be another fighting job in the Pacific . Headlong Admiral Halsey neither has nor cultivates any genius for riding a desk . <P> *And the only one with a Presidential possibility-his flag secretary , Lieut . Commander Harold Stassen on his staff .
