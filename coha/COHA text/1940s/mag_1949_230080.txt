William Theodore Evjue , the firebrand , muckraking owner and editor of the successful ( circ. 40,181 ) Capital Times of Madison , Wis. , likes tough , independent reporters who are not afraid to talk back to him . Reporter Cedric Parker , 42 , had measured up to the boss 's standard almost too well . In his 21 years on Evjue 's staff , Parker had earned a reputation as a crack reporter by such stunts as storming into tough gambling joints one jump ahead of raiding policemen . Reckless , hard-drinking Reporter Parker had also earned a left-wing reputation as a local C.I.O. official who had faithfully followed the Communist Party line . <P> In 1940 , when " Wild Bill " Evjue was an interventionist and Communists were not , Reporter Parker publicly denounced his boss as a warmonger . Editor Evjue denounced back , and later in an open letter to the C.I.O. , he called Reporter Parker " the Communist leader in Madison , " added " I defy him to publicly deny it . " Though Parker did not deny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he promoted him to city editor . <P> Rubbed Noses . Both Editor Evjue and Rebel Parker saw eye to eye on one thing . They had no use for Wisconsin 's 40-year-old Republican Senator Joseph R. McCarthy , an ex-Marine tailgunner who , in 1946 , had defeated Evjue 's good friend , Senator Robert M. La Follette Jr . In 1947 Parker dug up , and Evjue delightedly splashed across his front page , the fact that McCarthy had been compelled to fork over some $3,500 in back income taxes on stock-market profits when the Treasury disallowed some of his deductions . Last week , it was Senator McCarthy 's turn to rub both Evjue 's and Parker 's noses in some old muck of their own raking . <P> To 400 editors of Wisconsin daily and weekly newspapers , McCarthy sent a blistering letter charging Evjue 's paper with continually parroting the Daily Worker and asking whether it was not " the Red Mouthpiece for the Communist Party in Wisconsin . " He cited Evjue 's own 1941 accusation that Parker was a Communist and added : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has in any way changed his attitude . . . " <P> Skinned Knuckles . Parker denied last week that he was any longer a Communist and threatened to sue McCarthy . Editor Evjue snorted that McCarthy was simply getting ready for his 1952 reelection campaign by attacking his No. 1 newspaper critic . <P> Commented Wisconsin 's biggest daily , the conservative Milwaukee Journal ( circ. 319,126 ) : " We have a feeling that no one will take Senator McCarthy 's question very seriously . Politically , he 'd probably do a lot better charging Mr. Evjue with being what he is-a capitalist . It would probably make Mr. Evjue a lot madder . "
