txt The British Labor Party , having reaffirmed its determination that Britain shall fight till Adolf Hitler is defeated , and having rejected in advance any Nazi plan for a new European order , has now followed with the logical sequel by bringing its own plans for a new order a stage nearer crystallization . A special committee of Socialist experts has been appointed to draw up blueprints of reconstruction , the Whitsuntide Labor Party conference here was told in its concluding session yesterday . In the meantime Mr. Hugh Dalton , Minister of Economic Warfare in the present British Government and one of the leading Socialist economic planners , restated a broad outline of how his party would win the peace . Three Major Points Among the points he stressed were : 1 . That wartime planning of plenty in arms can and must be continued to provide peacetime requirements in plenty . In this way , Mr. Dalton contended , mass unemployment could at the same time be ended . 2 . That the treasury 's wartime I control over banks showed the Imanner in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society and not its master . 3 . That the wartime measure providing the 100 per cent excess Iprofits tax was a practical and effective example of how to prevent individuals profiting at the expense of common interests . Despite Mr. Dalton 's assurance that concrete reconstruction proposals would soon replace general principles , other Labor delegates criticized their Executive 's interim peace aims as vague and insufficiently progressive . They called for a far greater effort from the Labor Party to prevent a return to prewar conditions with the employing class recapturing their old privileges . Social Services Improved A hard-hitting reply to these critics came from Mr. Arthur Greenwood , member of the Inner War Cabinet and responsible in particular for the Government 's reconstruction plans . Stressing how Britain , despite its immense war burdens , had actually improved its social services in the past two years , he told the conference that he believed his role as member of the all-party Government was to find a common ground with other political viewpoints . Moreover , of the statement of peace aims by the Foreign Secretary , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No Conservative Minister has ever used such Labor language before . " Certainly Mr. Eden 's contention that future international security would depend largely on social security at home , and that there must be no selfish national advantages any more than selfish advantages for individuals , might well have been a pronouncement from a Socialist platform . Rights of the Individual Nor does the similarity of aims for better social equality end there . Other notable pronouncements made in the last seven days by President Roosevelt and Pope Pius XII have recognized freedom , the rights of man , and individual economic security as the basis of the peace of the future . Thus are the moral forces opposed to the totalitarian new order slowly mobilizing to conceive a concrete alternative to a new order under the Nazi heel . The urgent need for the clearest possible indication of what soi t of world a victorious British Empire plans to build with the lull co-operation of the American Continent has been brought home to me recently in conversation with an officer of the Free French fleet air arm who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Britain from France . This officer is convinced that a great number , perhaps a majority . of young Frenchmen , however much they may resent Naziism , have been so disillusioned in the record of democracy and the Entente Cordiale since the World War that they are prepared to base hopes of a new France on a National Socialist pattern . This observer of France 's present plight deplored the failure of British propaganda and information organizations to appreciate this situation . He expressed exasperation at the way prominent authorities here still seem to believe the British cause and British good intentions for the future need no advocacy abroad other than the British hallmark . Broad Outline Difficult The difficulty of giving even a broad outline of the postwar lineup of European countries is confirmed by the fact that neither Mr. Roosevelt , Pope Pius , Mr. Eden , nor delegates to the Labor Conference here attempted to define national boundaries or foreshadow a possible combination or combinations of States . Mr. Eden went the furthest in this matter when he spoke of the role Germany would play when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ co-operation Germany must play a part , " he said . But he vehemently recalled how , Germany had violated peace in ttre past century and added : " Our political and military terms of peace will be designed to prevent repetition of Germany 's misdeeds . " How About the Germans ? From personal experience with friends I am finding the question of " what to do with the Germans " after the war a delicate one . Many ordinarily kindly Britishers hold such bitter  --  and incidentally impractical  --  views about the post-war treatment of Germany that it is almost impossible to engage in a constructive discussion . To understand this view clearly it is necessary to focus it against the background viewed first-hand of the hideous suffering of modern warfare , and to remember that it is the second time that a great many have experienced the horrors of war because of German lust for power . Nevertheless my experience suggests that vindictiveness is least prevalent in those quarters which will have the closest personal responsibility for post-war planning .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
