The U.S. picked up some more Pacific real estate last week as troops landed unopposed on Kume Island ( 20 sq.mi. ) , 50 miles beyond Okinawa in the East China Sea , only 345 miles short of the China coast . Another airfield might be bulldozed out of Kume 's forested hillsides , and Okinawa 's left flank would be made more secure against attacking Jap planes . Radio Tokyo reported U.S. minesweepers clearing the way for an invasion of Okino Erabu ( 15 sq.mi. ) , 40 miles northeast of Okinawa . This suburban property would give similar protection to Okinawa 's right flank .
