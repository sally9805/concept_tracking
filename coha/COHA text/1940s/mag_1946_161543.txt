If Congress needed a further example of Presidential bad temper , it was supplied by New Hampshire 's Republican Senator Charles W. Tobey ( who was largely responsible for persuading the Senate not to accept Ed Pauley as Under Secretary of the Navy ) . A month ago he had written the President about the grain shortage which was forcing New England farmers to slaughter their chickens . Said Senator Tobey : " This is a Macedonian cry . " * <P> The President wrote him a blistering , tactless reply : <P> " It seems to me that you have been making Macedonian cries or yells ever since I have been in the White House . . .. Your unwarranted attacks on Mr. Pauley almost ruined a good public servant . . . . You have made it exceedingly difficult for me to get good men to fill the necessary places in the Government . You are still continuing your Macedonian cries and I hope you will get a lot of pleasure out of them . " <P> As for the grain shortage , said the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and if it comes to the decision as to which should be kept from starving , naturally , if I make the decision , it will be the people . . . . I do n't know whether that will please you or not . . . . Some time when you have reached a cooling-off period , I 'd be glad to talk with you about the whole situation . " Scrawled across the bottom of the typewritten page , in the President 's hand , was the command invitation : " Come and see me . " <P> Senator Tobey ignored the invitation , instead grumbled a while in private , finally publicized the whole correspondence last week in the Congressional Record . <P> <P> *And a vision appeared to Paul in the night ; there stood a man of Macedonia , and prayed him , saying , Come over into Macedonia and help us - Acts , 16:9.
