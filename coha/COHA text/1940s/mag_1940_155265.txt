Historians always and novelists never forget that statesmen 's worries are not exclusively those of the commonweal . Last week there came from France the story of a private tragedy which was nothing to the national tragedy but which touched French hearts . <P> Some years ago the plain daughter of a wealthy Marseille dock contractor caught an engineer Count , married him , moved to Paris and set up a salon for journalists and politicians . Helene de Fortes was short , homely , plain , dark , nervous , jealous and not very bright ; but she apparently had something for which Frenchmen would trade every grace . Widowed two years ago , she set her jib for a bright financier named Paul Reynaud . Soon Reynaud , who till then had been a good family man , separated from his wife . Under the administration of Georges Bonnet ( then Minister of Justice ) the divorce laws were altered and the financier expected to be free within one year instead of three . <P> Last March 21 , Paul Reynaud became Premier of France . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Countess de Fortes . She began to fancy herself as a power in the State , and while France 's troubles grew graver , her meddling voice grew shriller . She got hysterical when Frenchmen whispered that France 's fleur de Us was being crowded by a faded fleur du lit . At Tours and at Bordeaux , she was constantly in Government hair . Then Reynaud , France , and Countess de Portes 's hopes for grandeur fell . <P> Motoring from Bordeaux to the Riviera on June 28 , Paul Reynaud and Helene de Portes ran off the road . He injured his head . The Countess de Portes , having lost all for which she lived , lost her life .
