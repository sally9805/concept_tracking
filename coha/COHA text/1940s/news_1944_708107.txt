txt The impact of western capitalist civilization ? Rumanian style  --  upon the Red Army , instead of the anticipated vice versa , is the subject of considerable comment here and among Red Army men as additional thousands of men and women soldiers daily move through Rumania , Poland and Bulgaria in pursuit of the fleeing Nazi . Young men and women who have never been abroad before are seeing new sights , hearing new sounds and going through strange experiences as the course of battle takes them into the neighboring capitalist countries . Their reaction to all this is being studied closely here and it has been the subject of two three-column newspaper dispatches in Pravda , organ of the Contmunist party , and Red Fleet , the Navy newspaper , by Leonid Soboleff , one of the Soviet Union 's best-known war correspondents , who is with the troops in Bucharest . Mr. Soboleff 's observations and conclusions make up some of the most interesting reading that has appeared in the Soviet press . Here is his basic conclusion , which is also in the form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serving outside the fatherland : " We will have to pass through many foreign countries . A lot of tawdry brilliance will blind your eyes , Red Army men . Do n't believe these deceitful phantoms of pseudo civilization . Look into the heart of the country , look into the soul of the people . This wo n't deceive you , this will prove the real culture of the country . " At the end of the war you will return to your fatherland from the foreign countries where you have engaged in battles . Again the foreign peoples will live their own life . But in every spot where you have been a trace will always remain in the hearts of these people because you carried with you a high culture , the great soul of the Soviet people , who shed their blood for the freedom and happiness of millions of people . " The reaction of Mr. Soboleff and the Red Army men to the new things they have seen in Rumania , which is hardly a good representative of capitalist civilization , is , to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Women 's " Bluff " Deprecated In every army fighting across the world today one topic of conversation is women , and this is what Mr. Soboleff and some anonymous Red Army men thought about Rumanian womanhood : " You see pretty , standard-looking women with faces carefully done pale , despite the burning sunshine , with their make-up in the most complicated way and with dark red lips  --  the fashion seems to prescribe a ' sinful mouth . ' Two Red Army men sitting at a table drinking coffee are exchanging opinions . The first said , ' They look swell . ' His companion retorted : ' Put them under a stream of water and only then should you judge . No , my lad , our Ryazan girls are better . There is no bluff there . ' " Mr. Soboleff describes short dresses that show the knee and open-heeled shoes as " another achievement " of European civilization and reports this reaction of the two Red Army men : " One soldier thought open-heeled shoes , . which resemble nothing made in Russia , came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finish the shoe , but his partner had another reason . He said it was not a shortage of material , but simply the upgrowth of tradition , explaining that Rumanian soldiers in combat ' show their heels at the front and the same fashion now has been , transferred to the capital . ' " Mr. Soboleff cautions Red Army men not to be impressed with the cleanliness of the Rumanian capital . He notes the old saying that the culture of a nation is measured by the soap it consumes and reminds his soldier reading audience that world statistics prove that Germany consumed more soap than any other country and remarks , " But this war has proved what these clean cultured ' hands can do . " The Glitter of Bourgeoisie The Soviet writer also has a low opinion of the morals , culture and outlook of a majority of Bucharest residents , who , he said , live in the city amid speculation and business deals and care for only one thing : " How to sell for the most advantageous price their goods , their wives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheaper price a house , a job , etc. , and how to have smart clothes and with their help fool others into thinking you are rich . " Bucharest capitalists , he said , look as if they had emerged from old posters depicting the bourgeoisie . He described the heavy gold watch chains across their fat paunches add he described the homes of the wealthy , which he said are " protected by mysterious shutters , behind which are hidden a reticent life hostile to us and full of insipid luxury . " He recounted the surprise of Red Army men at the two classes of street cars , one for " clean ones " and the other for " the common people . " He made fun of the fancy , pompous uniforms worn by Bucharest policemen and of the funny high cushions in the taxicabs . Some Things Too Familiar He commented sharply that Bucharest residents had found life more natural , if not more profitable than usual during the war because the country had plundered Russia . He said he saw wonderful Russian furs in Rumanian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stock of canned goods from Odessa . In Constanta , he said , you can ride on an Odessa street car and other Iplaces are full of Russian trucks and light cars . " If you recall that the Rumanians took everything they could from Odessa , Kiev and other Soviet cities , you will easily understand why Bucharest does n't feel the privations of war , " Mr. Soboleff concluded . " When people died of starvation in Leningrad , the inhabitants of Bucharest were eating our flour , our fruit , our cattle , etc. , * * and the butler of the Lido Restaurant reddened when he noticed that he gave us a bottle of Crimean wine . " Mr. Soboleff said any other people except the Russians would have avenged these outrages with brutality and caused great suffering when they finally occupied the enemy capital . But the Red Army men , he said , came into Bucharest as veritable images of gallantry , courage and honor , " firmly marching across a strange capital and curiously looking at palaces and private residences , at policemen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
