txt The Price of Isolation A surprise witness has suddenly appeared to refute the isolationist spokesmen . It is the Tokyo Times-Advertiser , which has now announced the Axis plan for America 's place in the new " world order . " Our isolationists had assured us that to remain ? at peace we had only to refrain from further aid to Britain and concentrate on building an impregnable defense . But the Axis price of peace is a surrender of defense . In our case this includes surrender of the Philippines , dismantling or reducing all our Pacific bases , . submitting our Navy to actual inferiority , abandoning the Monroe Doctrine . As a sample of the kind of threat we should constantly live under , in a state of isolationist peace , this announcement is worth thinking about ; as an evidence of isolationist fallacy , it is an eyeopener . ROGER GILMAN . Cambridge , Mass. , May 3 , 1941.
