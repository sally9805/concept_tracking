Participants in a noonday service at an Anglican Church in London were startled last week by a message from the dead . Up rose Lord Dowding to read a letter which he believed was dictated to him by the spirit of a sailor missing in action . <P> Said the 61 - year- old retired Air Chief Marshal , who helped direct the magnificent R.A.F. defense during the Battle of Britain : " I have the largest number of messages from men who have passed over in this war . The fact that I want to stress is that the tone of these messages is ' We are O.K. ' and ' Do n't grieve for us . We 're the lucky ones . We 've never been so happy . . . . ' There is a great organization of Air Force men on the other side and I receive frequent messages from them . " Modern war 's horrors and personal tragedies have turned many a grieving man &; woman to spiritualism . But until Lord Dowding spoke up , there have been no such notable conversions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oliver Lodge during World War I. After his conversion , the zealous author of Sherlock Holmes toured Britain exhibiting spiritualistic snapshots in which he pointed out blurred spots that he claimed were pixies frolicking in a hazy landscape . <P> Famed Scientist Sir Oliver Lodge wrote a book ( Raymond ) purporting to be conversations with his soldier son , who had been killed in France . <P> The conversion of Sir Oliver Lodge also moved Sir Max Beerbohm to draw one of his funniest imaginary confrontations , in which Convert Lodge and Sir Edwin Ray Lankester , a British skeptic about spiritualism , look at each other and wonder at an ectoplasmic enigma .
