Infante Don Juan , third son of the late Alfonso XIII and heir to the inactive Spanish throne , let it be known last week that he was thinking of getting out his father 's robes and reopening the monarchy for business . The reports came from Bern , where the 30-year-old , British-trained Prince of the Asturias lives with his Bourbon-Sicily wife , Princess Maria Mercedes . Like startled pigeons , the several versions of the news rose , fluttered , settled back . <P> Most sensational report came from the New York Times 's Bern bureau , headed by unreliable Daniel T. Brigham . He reported an accord reached " in principle " between Don Juan and Franco , said restoration was due " in the very near future . " <P> There was much incognito flitting . Ex-Queen Victoria Eugenie , granddaughter of the great Victoria and widow of Alfonso XIII , lives in England , was recently in Switzerland . Cousin Alfonso d'Orlans , onetime Ford worker , last week went from Switzerland to Madrid . Juan Ventosa , confidant of the late King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw Churchill . The Duke of Alba , Spanish Ambassador in London , put in a quiet appearance in Bern in the spring . <P> The reports and the journeyings could mean much or little , but if fat Franco was looking for a hedge against disaster , he could do worse than to court Don Juan . Today Franco has the power to place the heir upon the throne ; tomorrow perhaps the new king would have the power to protect Loyal Subject Franco from the wrath which may sweep Spain in the wake of Hitler 's defeat .
