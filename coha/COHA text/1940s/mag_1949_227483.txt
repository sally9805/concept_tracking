To the young black bull , whose whole world had been the unpeopled , machine-less range , the two jeeps were a startling sight . When the jeeps came through the gate , the bull glared suspiciously and trotted off across the wide pasture of Mexico 's La Punta , the world 's biggest ranch for raising toros bravos ( brave bulls ) . The jeeps bounced after him in hot pursuit . They were out on a tienta , a test of fighting quality ( with modern trimmings ) , on which all things at La Punta depend . <P> Strapped to a perch atop the radiator of one of the jeeps was a man with a long wooden lance . As the jeep caught up , he rammed the lance against the bull 's flank , knocking him hoof over hide . All eyes in the jeeps were trained on the black bull , intent on his slightest move . <P> Scrambling to his feet , the bull , wavering neither to left nor right , charged head-on for the jeep that had goaded him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a sharper lance astride a well-padded horse nearby and whirled to charge the horse . The riders of the jeep were quick to approve . Above the young bull 's number in a thick registry book , a rider initialed in red ink the letters B.P. ( for Bravo Pronto ) . That meant that two years later , on some Sunday afternoon , in some jam-packed arena in Latin America , the fighting animal would carry the proud red-grey-and-gold colors of La Punta . <P> Peacocks &; Pictures . La Punta was part of the inspiration for Las Astas , the breeding ranch in Tom Lea 's bestselling The Brave Bulls ( TIME , April 25 ) . It sprawls over 15,000 hectares ( about 37,000 acres ) of the uneven tablelands of eastern Jalisco . In the aftermath of Mexico 's revolution , most big properties were broken up into small farms , but La Punta , like other ranches devoted to breeding fighting bulls , was exempted and cut by only one-half . Few Mexicans objected to this grant of privilege ; not even freedom had more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> La Punta 's owners , Francisco ( " Paco " ) and Jose ( " Pepe " ) Madrazo , are scions of one of the clans that flourished in the days of Porfirio Diaz . They have lived serenely through the social upheaval that started in 1910 . Within the 100 miles of fence that shields them from the new world , Don Paco and Don Pepe have saved and cherished much of the old . <P> At their stately , rambling hacienda house , ringed by a 15-foot brick-and-adobe wall , servants rush out at the toot of a horn to open the wide iron-plate gates . Peacocks strut in the shade of the garden 's lemon and eucalyptus trees , and dark-suited waiters move through the great halls inside , passing golden glasses of fine manzanilla sherry from Spain and serving tortillas on the end of a knife blade . La Punta can accommodate 30 guests with all the comforts of a metropolitan hotel . <P> Coyotes &; Pumas . Don Paco and Don Pepe always wear the classic skin-tight suits of Andalusian gentry when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Spanish spurs accompanies them . The animals themselves represent La Punta 's greatest tie to Spanish tradition . About 2,000 are pure-bred descendants of the big , black Parlad , of the noble bull blood of famed Vistahermosa farm , and his harem of 50 black Vistahermosa cows that the Madrazos brought from Spain in 1923.
