txt Special Cable to THE NEW Yoa TIMES . LONDON , Jan. ** of an imminent quarrel between Downing Street and the White House over American policy in Algeria and Morocco are causing so much concern here that Brendan Bracken , Minister of Information , went so far today as to allow himself to be quoted , I thus departing from the general practice of talking off the record . Any statement that the British Foreign Office is backing General Charles de Gaulle , leader of the Fighting French , in opposition to the State Department 's preference for General Henri Honor ? Giraud , leader of the French in North Africa , is " just not true , " Mr. Bracken said . The whole African campaign , he declared , is of most vital importance to the Allied plans ultimately to invade Europe , and he asserted that reports of a controversy between the two countries did not help matters at all . There have been differences of opinion , he conceded , but that is bound to happen no matter how closely allied the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He added : " The British Government has given General Dwight D. Eisenhower the power of attorney and will support him unquestioningly , whatever he does . " During a discussion of North African problems Mr. Bracken , who is one of Prime Minister Winston Churchill 's closest confidants , said he regarded it as important to have a single spokesman for all France . Far from impeding conversations between General de Gaulle and Giraud , he said , both governments are doing their utmost to bring it about . Neither in Whitehall " nor , in my opinion , in Washington , " he said , is there the slightest support for the Count of Paris , whose record , he said , is " a motttled one .

For a while the public has shown signs of rising agitation , the government seems increasingly to adopt the attitude that General Eisenhower as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tough problem on his hands , that he is the best judge of how to handle it and that everything will come right soon . That is not to say that all in the Churchill government like all the aspects of the political situation in North Africa , and privately some express themselves pretty forcefully for Britons supposedly given to understatement . But to suggest that there is any serious likelihood of a rift in United States-British relations over General Eisenhower ' .. ; policy would be unduly pessimistic . What is more likely is that the United States policy plus British silent acquiescence may cause the divergence of views held in Moscow to become a little wider than it is already between the Soviet capital and Washington and London . The situation as it exists today can be compared to that which existed last Summer when the British public , egged on by Moscow , was clamoring for the immediate opening of a second front in Europe , and the government was holding its tongue and planning to strike in French North Africa . Between the governments concerned there never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the necessities of propaganda for domestic consumption in Russia and for secrecy about the intentions here and in Washington sometimes have made it look as if there were .
