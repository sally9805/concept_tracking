 | SOVIET TERROR IN THE BALTICS Condensed from " Sovjets Blodsdad i Baltikum " Albert Kalme WHAT HAPPENS to a people absorbed by the Soviet Union ? We citizens of Latvia can answer that question . Along with our Baltic neighbors , Estonia and Lithuania , we fought in World War I against imperialist Germany and later against Bolshevik Russia . We won our independence , were recognized by all the powers , joined the League of Nations and remained free until June 1940 , when Vyacheslav Molotov , with unprecedented cynicism , accused Russia 's three little neighbors of designs against the great Soviet Union . Burning and pillaging , the Red Army moved into the helpless Baltic lands . Our liberties were swept away . Eight years have now passed ? eight years of suffering , first under the tyranny of the Soviets , then of the Nazis , then the Soviets again . Now we are the forgotten countries of Europe , for whom time is running out . Once the Bolshevist octopus fastens its tentacles about a people , it sucks the lifeblood of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for any country over which the Hammer and Sickle waves : the dread secret police , the MVD ; constant spying and terror ; destruction of national culture ; outlawing of religious worship ; transformation of education into propaganda for the State ; collectivization of property ; and ruthless deportations of people to slave labor . The Riga building that formerly housed the Ministry of Interior is now MVD headquarters . Each small cell in it is equipped with a ventilator which can be closed from outside , a series of heating pipes and a small glass " eye " through which the MVD torturers watch their victims .  | The arrested person sits there  - -   - -   he has no room to stand up or lie down  - -  -  while the pipes get hotter and hotter ; finally he loses consciousness . Then he is given fresh air until he revives , and is brought out , shaking with exhaustion , for questioning . Under such treatment the victim must be abnormally strong not to sign any sort of confession after a few days . For really obstinate prisoners there are forms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chambers are lined with thick black rubber so the walls and floors can be hosed down . Here burning , branding , puncturing the head with needles , mutilation of organs are regular procedure . Whether confessions are obtained or not , victims of these chambers are usually shot . Soviet spies blanket Latvia like a shroud of death . No one knows whether the man or woman next to him is a secret-police agent , so almost all normal conversation has ceased . Many traps are set by the MVD . A friend of mine in Riga overheard a woman at a social gathering severely criticizing Latvia 's oppressors . Addressing her comments to my friend , she condemned Stalin by name . He gave partial assent in a few polite answers . Late that night he was dragged from his bed and thrown into a cell . Rewards are given for informers against " enemies of the State " which can mean anyone who criticizes the shortage of bread , who failed to vote for the single list of Communist candidates , or simply someone discovered with unconfiscated property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ betray one another , for this indicates the breakup of " bourgeois sentiment . " The law of civilized nations respects family loyalty and relieves relatives from the duty of giving evidence against the accused . Bolshevist law brands this as criminal weakness and demands family ties be ignored in securing evidence of " disloyalty " to the State . All cultural values that the people , through tradition and custom , hold dear  --  our language , literature , religion , conceptions of justice  --  are fast being obliterated . Persons disappear if they lay a wreath with a ribbon in the national colors at any ceremony , or if they dare sing the national anthem , " God Bless Latvia , " or chant a folksong . In 1941 , Red soldiers applied the  | torch to the Riga Library . The flames consumed 300,000 volumes , including several famous collections . Our symbol of local government , the Riga City Hall , and much of the " Old City " ? an area of historic buildings were reduced to ashes . The Soviet constitution grants " freedom of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for spiritual faith and practice are utterly incompatible with the Soviet 's insistence upon complete subordination of the individual to the State . All forms of religion in my country have been crushed . Ceremonies are forbidden in burial grounds . Outlawed are religious journals , catechisms and prayer books . Theological seminaries are closed , monasteries and religious societies dissolved . The teaching of religion is forbidden in all schools and churches . All ecclesiastical properties including churches were confiscated . In certain few exceptions the churches could be used , but were exorbitantly taxed . At the beginning of Soviet occupation , clergymen were summoned to the MVD offices and urged to renounce their calling or to become informers . All preferred martyrdom to either apostasy or betrayal of their parishioners . Since then ministers have been singled out for persecution . Most of them have been forced to take up manual work . One of my close friends , a Baptist clergyman , carries sacks of potatoes all day . Another parson of my acquaintance works as a cutter in a peat bog . Education in the Baltic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrest of teachers considered " politically unreliable . " Hundreds were shot or sent to forcedlabor camps . Today practically all the old Latvian teachers are gone . Many were replaced by Russians . Now all must certify in writing that they do not believe in God . Cherished concepts of morality can no longer be taught Latvian youth , for under Bolshevist precepts gross materialism and , animalism form the bases of human relationships . Books of licentious nature are standard in school libraries ; " free love " is actively encouraged . Numerous incidents of rape and immorality occur on school grounds and in the buildings . On the walls of every schoolhouse are huge pictures of Marx , Lenin and Stalin . Every child must learn that he lives by the magnificent bounty of Stalin . Every lesson must be slanted to endorse the class struggle and the ultimate triumph of the proletariat . Appropriation of private property began in July 1940 . Factories , shops , transportation firms , banks ? all were taken . Artisans were deprived of their tools and depositors of their money . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Collectivizing of farms was not immediately attempted , for it would have aroused intense resistance . The Latvian people were deeply attached to their small individual plots of ground . Furthermore , they knew of the terrible sufferings of the Russian  | farmers under Stalin 's collectivizing plan , when at least ten million people , bitterly resisting the loss of their freedom and property , were deliberately starved to death . Employing the usual Bolshevist treachery , the secretary of the Communist Party announced : " Certain enemies of the new regime spread the rumor that the new government is establishing kolkhozes collective farms . This is not true . No kolkhozes will be set up . The desires and demands of the people will always be considered . " Nevertheless , collectivization was gradually enforced . The first step was to set up a " land reform " pro gram , whereby farms were limited to 25 acres ? this to set small farmers against larger landowners . Land , livestock and equipment were taken without compensation . More than ro , 000 farms were ruined . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agricultural cartel . Then the first collective was formed . Now most Latvian farms are collectivized . There followed the inevitable Sovietizing of our standards of living . Incentives to work and produce were killed . Economic stagnation set in . Today our once-plentiful land is an area of poverty and degradation . Foreign trade has almost ceased . Food is difficult to obtain . To remain alive at all , people have to buy most items on the black market , where prices are exorbitant . Latvian workers are slaves of the Soviet . For hard physical labor , as in a sawmill , they get ten to 12 rubles a day , of which about one third is deducted for the State . A pair of men 's shoes costs 500 rubles . The first major deportation of people for slave labor in the Baltic lands began on the night of June 14 , 1941 . In the course of three tragic days , tens of thousands of our people were ruthlessly torn from their homes , loaded into trucks , driven to cattle trains and deported to Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engineers , doctors and other professional and skilled workers . No Latvian can ever forget that summer of horror . The loaded trains often stood for days before moving . Anyone attempting to give the deportees food or water was instantly shot . At least 35,000 Latvians and 12o,000 Estonians and Lithuanians are known to have been killed or deported during the first year of occupation . In forced-labor camps scattered from the Urals to far Siberia , the victims of deportation dig canals , mine salt , build roads and make munitions , on starvation diets , with . out sanitation or comforts , until they are relieved by death . Today there is a strong underground movement in the Baltic nations . Can freedom be ours again ? Many of us believe there is only one way : through a reorganized United Nations , made up of the free peoples of the world , which will use collective strength to defend liberty and justice against tyranny and oppression everywhere .                    @
