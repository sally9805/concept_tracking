All My Sons ( by Arthur Miller ; produced by Harold Clurman , Elia Kazan &; Walter Fried , in association with Herbert H. Harris ) has a theatrical force that covers a multitude of sins . Playwright Miller ( best known for his novel , Focus ) tends to overload his plot and overheat his atmosphere . His writing is uneven , some of his main characters are sometimes unreal , and most of his minor characters are at all times unnecessary . But he combines enough purposefulness with enough power to make him the most interesting of Broadway 's new serious playwrights-few of whom , unfortunately , are interesting at all . <P> The play examines Joe Keller , an airplane parts manufacturer . With two sons of his own in the war , Keller is guilty of having sent other men 's sons to their deaths by shipping out defective cylinders . Worse still , he let his partner go to prison for it . Keller 's flyer son , Larry , engaged to the jailed partner 's daughter , has been missing in China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idealistic Chris , has come home , swallowed his father 's protestations of innocence , and arranged to marry his missing brother 's fiancee . But Chris 's mother will not hear of it ; she will not admit that Larry is dead . It becomes clear that she can not admit it without recognizing the enormity ( she has long known the truth ) of her husband 's misdeed . Eventually Chris , too , faces the truth . The old man , after agreeing to confess and go to prison , shoots himself . <P> This story is written with passion , but without soapbox oratory . It less reviles Profiteer Keller than it sternly reveals him : he has rationalized his guilt by telling himself that he acted like any " practical " American ; he has sloughed off his responsibility to society by concentrating on his duty to his family . In Chris and his mother , too , tribal loyalties clash with human obligations . <P> All My Sons is social criticism , but in moral terms ; it clearly insists on individual responsibility . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotions . And with its unblushing penchant for theater-tense atmosphere , patly timed revelations and whopping climaxes-it is a compelling rather than an entirely convincing play . The production adds to the impact : Ed Begley as Keller , Beth Merrill as Keller 's wife , and above all Arthur Kennedy as Keller 's son , play with consistent force .
