American women are different . Mr. Wu Kun-Kan , as a Chinese newspaper correspondent in the U.S. , had studied the inscrutable ways of the West long enough to realize that . Last week , in a letter to a Shanghai paper , he tried to tell his countrymen about it : <P> " During the war , women came out and worked . . . . They were in high spirits and were well off economically . . . . But they had no men . . . . Every day , married women feared for the lives of their husbands and the unmarried women worried and moped at not being able to obtain the love of a man . Some girls 18 and 19 years of age even . . . saved money to maintain themselves as old maids . " <P> Then " last August , when news of victory was broadcast . . . people all over went mad with joy , but happiest of all were the girls . . . . So now returned G.I.s make love easily . In dance halls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men . . . . Their yearning for men is like the yearning for rain during a drought . . . . In universities , the girls are like refugees who see meat and fish before them ; girl students in enticing , flowery clothes gather around ragged boy students . . . competing with each other to gain their favors . . . . In the streets , no more is it men who stare at women , but instead women who steal glances at men . " <P> Mr. Wu could not help but regard this turned-about state of affairs as most delightful . The U.S. was indeed the promised land-for men . How different , he exclaimed wistfully , were things in China : " In Chungking , boy students running after girl students find it a very hard job indeed . A boy would often exhaust the strength of nine oxen and two tigers and still not succeed . If their endeavors were used in America , American girls would consider them as most ideal sweethearts .
