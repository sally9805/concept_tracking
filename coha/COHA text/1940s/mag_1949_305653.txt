At the University of Illinois ' College of Medicine in Chicago this week , a gaunt , sallow-faced man , a sufferer from cancer of the throat , stepped into a basement room furnished only with an improvised table , a mirror and an awesome machine . Technicians arranged the cancer victim on the table while Dr. Roger A. Harvey peered through the strange machine 's ring sights ( like those on an aircraft machine gun ) at the patient 's neck . When the apparatus was aimed just right , the technicians left the room . <P> Dr. Harvey ducked into the adjoining control room and peeked at the mirrored image of his patient through a hole three inches wide , bored through the 50-inch lead-shielded wall . Physicist Dr. John S. Laughlin grasped a knob on a black panel and set it at 25 million volts . He set another knob at 100 . Then , on a signal from Harvey , Laughlin pushed a big green button . <P> High Speed . The air was filled with an electric whine . On the white-sheeted table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see nothing except the grey , perforated wallboard beyond his feet . But coursing through his neck , in invisible bursts 180 times a second , was a beam of X rays whipped up by the 25 million volts to a speed almost exactly equal to that of light . The beam was aimed at the center of the cancer . <P> The unseen but terrifyingly powerful bombardment lasted for three minutes and 20 seconds while Laughlin nursed his controls . When the machine 's electrical brain reported that the prescribed dosage of 100 roentgens had been delivered to the patient , it shut itself off . " O.K. , " said Laughlin , " that 's it . " Thus the University of Illinois unveiled its betatron , the first of such power to be used in the U.S. for medical treatment. * Its advantage over earlier X-ray producers , most of which generate no more than a sixtieth of its power , is in the penetrating power of its high-speed , ultra-shortwave rays . Ordinary rays do most of their work at the skin surface or just below it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause serious skin burns . The betatron 's supercharged rays have their greatest impact on malignant cells from an inch to an inch and a half below the surface . <P> The betatron 's first patient , who is 72 , had cancer of the larynx , rooted about an inch beneath the skin . It was bigger than a golf ball and was spreading to the lymph glands in his neck . He had spent hours at a time racked by uncontrollable coughing . His sense of taste was gone . And he was losing weight . The cancer was too far advanced to be operated on . Unchecked , it would grow until it killed him by strangulation . <P> High Hopes . If Radiologist Harvey 's estimate is right , every day for the next two to three weeks more &; more cancer cells in and around the patient 's larynx will have their nuclei killed by the betatron 's almost irresistible rays . Patients with deep-seated malignancies in other parts of the body also started treatment this week . Soon Dr. Harvey should be able to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shows promise . If the answer is favorable , high-powered , penetrating X rays may be used in about 10% of cancer cases. * Whether they give lasting results can not be known for several years . <P>
