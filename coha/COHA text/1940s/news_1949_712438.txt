txt Chicago has become the first city in the country and the world to accommodate more than 1,000 arriving and departing airplanes a day at its airports . This latest news impetus f o r boosting civic pride came yesterday from Oscar E. Hewitt . commissioner of public works , who referred to the latest bulletin of the Airport Operators council as evidence . The bulletin , Hewitt pointed out , disclosed that there were 244,181 plane movements at Chicago air port and O'Hare field In the eight months ended Aug. 31 . Breaking this total down on the basis of 242 days in the eight month period , he explained that this meant a daily average of 1,004 planes . Editor 's Figures Too Low Hewitt also emphasized that this figure actually should be higher , inasmuch as the Airport Operators council editor failed to consider Meigs fiQld on Northerly island . In the eight month period , Hewitt said , this field for small planes had 15 , - 615 plane movements . On the other hand , Hewitt pointed out that New York City , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only 137,639 plane movements at its La Guardia and Idlewild airports in the eight month period . And in all fairness , Hewitt said New York City should be given credit for the Newark , N. J. airport . But even with this field , which had 74,399 plane movements , the New York City total still would fall short of Chicago 's , he added . " These figures clearly show that Chicago is the cross-roads of the world In aviation , " said Hewitt . " There are no figures on airports in other countries , but I 'm going on the assumption that if Chicago is first in aviation in the United States , it is obviously first in the world . " Traffic to Else in 1960 Hewitt also said that a still greater airplane traffic is in store for Chicago next year . He said he based this prediction on the fact that major air lines have indicated that they expect to put on more " coach " plane runs which would compete with the so-called irregular or charter plane business . " Coach " planes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower class of air travel . Meals on the plane are eliminated , the number of hostesses is reduced , and flights often are scheduled at less desirable traveling times .
