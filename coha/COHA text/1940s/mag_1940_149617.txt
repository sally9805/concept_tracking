GUILTY MEN- " Cato " - Stokes($1.50) . <P> This short , slim book of some 140 pages caused an uproar in England . It indicted the former members of the Chamberlain Government , several of whom have remained in the Churchill Government , largely by stating their records , and suggested that the British Isles would be a little more buoyant if these men were dropped overboard . When certain British booksellers refused to handle distribution of Guilty Men in the usual way , news dealers took it over , sold eager Britons 50,000 copies of the book in three weeks . Last week it appeared in the U. S. <P> The author of Guilty Men ( " Cato " ) shrouds himself , for reasons which nobody seems to know , in a thick British fog . He has been guessed to be Winston Church ill 's son Randolph , H. G. Wells , Lord Beaverbrook , Leslie Hore-Belisha , Alfred Duff Cooper . All flatly deny authorship . At any rate Guilty Men is terse , biting , sometimes eloquent , gives every appear ance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new . But the total indictment is terrible . Guilty Men is headed by a cast sheet of villains . Among them : Ramsay MacDonald , Earl Baldwin of Bewdley , Neville Chamberlain , Sir John Simon , Sir Samuel Hoare , Lord Halifax , Sir Thomas Inskip , Mr. Leslie Burgin , a half-dozen others . <P> The patriotism of these men is not questioned . No fifth column is mentioned . The charges against them are appeasement , playing politics with national defense , negligence in face of danger , blundering , in eptitude , plain stupidity . Most crushing part of the indictment is the simple quota tions in Chapter I from survivors of the Battle of Flanders - brief , unemotional statements about the enemy 's superiority in equipment , casual comments that it is " the story of an Army doomed before they took the field . " The rest of the book is a true bill against the politicians who doomed these soldiers . <P> Ramsay MacDonald and Stanley Baldwin " took over a great empire , supreme in arms and secure in liberty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Next on the list is Sir Samuel Hoare . <P> " Like the Abbe Sieyes who was asked what he had done in the Great French Revolution , Sir Samuel could faithfully reply : ' I kept alive . ' " Hoare 's record includes negotiating , without the knowledge of the French , the British-German naval pact , selling Haile Selassie out in the Hoare-Laval agreement . In fact , " as Foreign Secretary , Sir Samuel Hoare passed from experience to experience , like Boccaccio 's virgin , without discernible effect upon his condition . " <P> When " the apple blossom of Bewdley " made way for " the hardware of Birmingham , " Neville Chamberlain , the era of grand blunders had begun . High point , of course , was Munich . " Cato " does not believe that Chamberlain had to back down at Munich . Said the Prime Minister to somebody who questioned Hitler 's promises at Munich : " Ah , but this time he promised me.
