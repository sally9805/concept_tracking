 | The Heroism of Burma 's Dunkirk Condensed from Cosmopolitan , /h Major Robert Lateiner U. S. Army Air Forces ( Medical Corps ) As told to Donald E. Keyhoe QN THE dusty airfield at Myitkyina a baby had been born . His young English mother , like hundreds of other refugees milling around our improvised ambulance plane in the humid monsoon heat , was trapped at the end of the North Burma railroad . And Jap troops were closing in . As I walked down the rows of wounded British soldiers ? gaunt men , half starved in the long retreat From Rangoon ? a British noncom caught my eye . " Give her my place , " lie whispered from his stretcher . " She 's had a rough go of it ? lost her husband at Singapore . No rush for me. just tell her you 'll get me next time . " I nodded . Before taking off for India , we made room for the mother on the floor of the plane , where 5o wounded lay shoulder to shoulder in a plane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army planes shuttled through the treacherous Naga Hills , taking supplies to Allied forces in Burma , bringing out the sick and wounded for whom escape by air was the last hope . The only other link with India and safety was the Ledo Road , through nearly 30o miles of malaria-infested jungle , where even the able-bodied died by the score . The road to the flying field was crowded with refugees ? English , American , Anglo-Burman and Indian ? disheveled and dirty . I shall never forget their faces . Some stood starkly alone , their families wiped out in Jap raids . Many had been through four attacks or more . Each time they had fled ; now they could go no farther . Tattered and bloodstained soldiers lay in long rows in the open field , with wounds that had not been dressed in days . There was no shelter for anyone , yet the midday temperature was seldom less than 12o . As one plane took off , a man ran up with a three-year-old girl in his arms . I shook my head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ablebodied . " Not for me . " He held out the child desperately . " Please ? she  | weighs only a few pounds . " I took her from him , and the engines soon drowned the child 's sobs . Each time a plane returned , the small guard of soldiers fought to hole back all but those to whom the Led ( Road would have been a death sentence . But no system could control those panicky thousands . Healthy adults reached the planes by mistake , and we had to turn them bad to make room for the old and the sick . Many families were split ? some never to be reunited . But separations came mercifully fast because of our swift departure . There was mob fear , yet above al there was courage and sacrifice . H saw an old man give up his place to sick girl and quietly disappear . A young Burman nurse brought a crippled woman out to the plane and we told the nurse she too could stay aboard . She looked at the tired hopeful faces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later , " she said , and turned away . As the crowd of refugees increased , the planes took off with incredible loads , as high as 74 in a single trip . with three or four even crammed in the washroom . The pilots had to weave between towering peaks , some of them 17 , oo0 feet high , practically uncharted , and one of them loomed 2ooo feet higher than shown on the map . The air was violently rough . Frightened women shrieked as we dropped in down drafts , and the sick got sicker . Only grim determination kept some of the men alive . One British tankman was badly burned . When his crew had come out of their disabled tank , grinning Japs had turned a flame thrower on them , burning two men alive . Another tank ha saved him . Through blistered lips h swore revenge . " I 've got to make it I 've got to get even . " At Myitkyina I saw only one meadical officer besides myself ? a tall , bearded Sikh , a captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a turban , he towered over frantic refugees trying to storm the planes . On day , as we were loading , he took me to a young Australian soldier . The boy was ( lying . " I 'm not going to make it , am I ? " he said . " It 's all right . . . . Give my stretcher to somebody else  - -  tell him to kill a Jap for me . " The Sikh 's grim eyes met mine . It was useless to pretend . He looked down again . " Sleep in peace , my son , " he said . " They shall repay this debt ? many times . " By mid-April a few more Army Air Force planes reached us . Pan American Airways rushed ships with full crews , and China National Airways did its valiant best . But there was no rest for the tired pilots , who had flown seven days a week with only a few hours ' sleep each night . The pilots lived in huts made of bamboo framework with a mixture of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the loose bamboo doors . Food was scarce .  | We slept on rough wooden frames crisscrossed with ropes . Despite the hardships , I have never seen men a with better morale . Our rescue planes were under constant observation by Jap reconnaissance ships . We could hear them jabbering , radioing their fighters to intercept the ambulance ships . Our plots shook them off by expert cloud-hopping . Many of them had been airline pilots back home and flew as unconcernedly as though it were the New York-Washington run . Without heroics they brought thousands of wounded safely through monsoon weather that would have grounded an airliner . Some planes carried one or two Tommy guns , but t his was mainly for psychological effect . Against a Zero 's machine guns the Tommics would have been peashooters . Normally , a flight surgeon 's job is to keep his flyers in fighting trim . Ile must fly with them , eat with them , hear their jokes and grouches ; he must know their mental reactions thoroughly . I watched for signs of mental fatigue that can lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a close escape from Jap fighters . When it happened the second time , I checked with the copilot and the crew . They had seen no sign of Japs . The next morning I flew with him ? and again he saw invisible Zeros . Ile had plain pilot-fatigue . Unless caught at once , it might end his flying days . Simply grounding him would have been fatal . The fear of being thought yellow would have blocked all chance of cure . An " important job " in a rear area was created for him . In a few weeks he was cured . As the British and General Stilwell 's forces retreated , new panic swept North Burma . A plane had barely unloaded gas for the Flying Tigers one morning at Loi Wing when Jap fighters and bombers dived at the field . Panic-stricken refugees ran wildly in all directions . There was no defense ; for 2o minutes at point-blank range the Japs riddled the wounded trying to crawl away . Coolly , methodically , they raked groups of women and children huddled near the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a miracle not in a vital spot . That night mechanics worked by kerosene lamp and candles to dismantle and repair the tail of the ship . Next morning we checked the engines and got the wounded aboard . Grazing bomb craters , the ship got off and made for the Naga IIills . By the second week of May we knew that Myitkyina was doomed . By air the Japs were less than 2o minutes away . Each day as the last plane took off at dusk you could see the upturned faces of those left behind . The wounded on their stretchers , the homeless refugees ? all slept on the open field waiting for dawn and the khaki-colored ships that meant their chance for life . I remember the last day . " Doc , "  | said one of the pilots , " there 's a kid over there on a stretcher ? he could n't be more than 19 . They brought him clear up to the ship ? I saw his face . But there was n't any room . " " We 'll get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , Doc , this is the end . He knew it . They all know it , poor devils ! " If we could have flown at night we might have saved those last ill-fated hundreds . But flying the uncharted passes in the dark would have meant suicide and murder . ALL THE misery of war came to that little village at the end of the railroad , Myitkyina ? the Dunkirk of Burma . How many died in the final massacre there we shall never know . But over 8o0o people were J brought out of Burma by the modern miracle of air evacuation .
