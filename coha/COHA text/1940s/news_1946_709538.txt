Lump sum payments of insurance have always been non-taxable as income . That part of payments made in instalments that might be considered in the nature of interest has been subject to tax in some cases . For example , an individual took out a policy for S10,000.in favor of his wife , the policy containing a provision for payment either in one amount or in ten annual instalments of $1.075 . If . before his death , the insured decided to have the money paid to his wife in instalments , no part of the payments was taxable to her . However . if he failed to do so and she , after his death , elected to take the instalments , she was taxable on $75 each year .

Supreme Court , in the Kirby Lumber case , held that when a solvent taxpayer redeems its own bonds at less than the issue price the difference is taxable income .

THE TIME LIMIT for filing tax refund claims depends upon the nature of the case . Provisions of the law prescribing time limits for filing claims are contained in two sections of the Revenue Code . On the surface these sections seem to differ . One of them , Section 322(b) ( 1 ) , states that a claim for a refund must be filed within three years of the time the return was filed , or within two years of the time the tax was paid . The other , Section 3313. states that claims for refunds of taxes " alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed or collected . " must be filed within four years of payment . The courts have held that the differentiation lay in whether the claim was based on a mere miscalculation of the tax or on an erroneous or illegal assessment . Said the U. S.

More than three years later , on March 30 , 1944 , it filed a claim for a refund of $1,053 . The Commissioner of Internal Revenue rejected the claim on the ground that the statute of limitations had run against the company . The court upheld the company 's right to file a claim within four years of payment of the tax assessed . ? ? ?
