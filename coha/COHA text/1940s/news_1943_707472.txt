txt The beverage barometer points to plenty of tea and coffee but a declining supply of cocoa in the cold winter months ahead That 's the forecast of men in this industry who keep a close eye on supply and demand . Key to the puzzle , they emphasize , lies in the places the United Nations pick to do their major fighting and in the general shipping situation Tea . coffee , and cocoa all have to be imported ; if supply ships from here dock near sources of these beverages they can bring a load back . Shipping could he one explanation of the trouble with cocoa now . There was a serious shortage a year ago , before Allied forces went into Africa . But American . merchant ships . escrying tanks , planes , guns and ammumt.on to Algiers and Tunisia stopped at West African ports on the way back , bringing hundreds of thousands of bags of the beverage beans in their holds . The battle for Africa has ended , and the Mediterranean fighting has moved into Italy . So imports of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world consumption have dropped sharpl1 , . for the time being at least , and stocks here are sliding downward . Plenty of Coffee Assured That there will he ample coffee , however , is a forecast backed by the National Coffee Association with an agreement to contribute $5,000 to the U.S.O. if coffee is rationed again at any time during the war Big tea blenders appear just as optimistic on the outlook . They are preparing a campaign to promote increased consumer use of their products . The-corner giocerj .. they feel . is overdoing the " under-the-counter " sales psychology Tea importers say it s unnecessary now and unwarranted as far as their goods are Concerned . Tea stocks in wholesale trade channels increased nearly 45 ' , ; , between June 30 and September 30 Representatives of the beverage industry say there are only two possibilities that could darken present rosy prospects for tea and coffee .

Shortages of Containers Could Hurt The second possibility is distribution troubles Transportation delays or an inade- quate supply of containers could bring about temporary shortages of the beverage supplies Following are summaries of the situation in each of the three major beverages : COCOA : Lack of shipping is blamed for the sudden . unexpected contraction in cocoa imports . Shipments up to early November reached large proportions . They were running approximately 2i,2 times the amount shipped in the previous year . " Bahla 's " ? grown in Brazil  --  are still coming regularly . The trouble lies in the crops of West Africa This includes the Gold Coast , Ivory Coast and Nigeria , where 63 , , of world production originates . Brazil accounts for about 25 ' , of the total supply . The old crop of Accra-Lagos ?

Britain and the United States reportedly are exploring the possibility of some sort . of lend-lease-in-reverse on this commodity Further shipments from West Africa might he handled only on that basis Control of the African crop is lodged entirely in the hands of the West African Produce Control Board . a British Ministry of Food affiliate The control board recently announced the purchase of the new Gold Coast and Nigerian crops on the same basis as last yea : that is , on the rate of 7 shillings ( about $1 40o per load of 60 pounds The British may not he so anxious to dispose of the West African crop In %iew of a possible early termination of European hostilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West African production may be held in reserve to build up stocks of foodstuffs for liberated territories In any event , the West Afi ' can " mystery " has had repercussions on the domestic supply situation Mid-November stocks were calculated at nearly 259 million pounds or about 45 million pounds greater thin a year aco This supply was considered sufficient for about five months Nov ? . si% weeks later . statisticians estimate there is only enough for 3 to 3 , , months The shot p curtailment in imports was accompanied by huge purchases of cocoa by the Army winch forced the cocoa tvan processors to d:g deeply into their reserves COFFEE : A current decline in coffee imports , growing out of a price =pass. between Brazilian shippers and the 0 .

Brazilian shippers , hoping for an early peace that would reopen the European market . and beset with increased labor and other costs at home , have been holding out for higher prices . They have been asking two to three cents a pound more than domestic ceiling prices But the 0 P.A. has refused to revise its maximums on coffee beans , either green or roasted . Some shippers , tiring of the deadlock , have begun to reoffer on a workable price basis , but others are still holding out . Regardless of the outcome of the present price deadlock , considerable coffee previously purchased will soon begin to arrive . In fact , some quarters would not be surprised to see stocks climb back to . or beyond the peak of 4.280.000 bags reached last September . This does not include an extra 500.000 bags held here for the account of the C.0 C. which were shipped last summer to take advantage of a temporary surplus in shipping apace at that time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ e ? er , about containers . They are still waiting for the War Food Administration to put through its proposed program guaranteeing them glass jars and caps for 450 million pounds of coffee for the year beginning October 1 . 1943 . While the glares situation has been improving . cartons , which are necessary in most shipments using glass containers . have been tighter because of the paper and paper-board shortage . TEN : The drink that is second only to water in human consumption has probably made the most remarkable supply comeback of the three hot beverage ingredients . The Jap invasion of the Dutch Indies cut the United States off from 57 ' 1 , of its normal imports : Java and Sumatra furnished Japan and Japanese-dominated areas , 14e , , and China 6 ' , Thus the sources of normal annual imports of around 100 million pounds were half eliminated Through intensified cultivation of the tea gardens of India and Ceylon . however , not only has the deficit been made up , but better quality teas are coming in. importers say With increased shipping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in filling our needs Last September , delivery quotas were increased from the wartime low of 50 ' , to 60 ' , . or at the rate of 60 million pounds The increase was made retroactive to July 1 , 1943 .

Quota for the first quarter of 1944 Is set at 75 ' .. but barring untoward events an shipping , the allowatee is expected to be boosted again to 85 ' , .
