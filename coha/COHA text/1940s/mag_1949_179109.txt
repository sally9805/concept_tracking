On the playing fields of Athens last week , in the Mediterranean Friendship Cup series , the Turkish soccer team beat the Greeks . A Greek fan , Zafiris Tilimachis , 38 , climbed to the Acropolis at sundown and jumped to his death from a rock . He left a note saying he could not bear his country 's shame . <P> Then the victorious Turks met the Italians . With five minutes to play and the score tied , Italy 's outside right passed to his center forward who passed to the inside left who kicked a goal . The Turks claimed the inside left was offside . The Greek referee failed to allow the Turkish objection and declared Italy the winner . <P> Turkish players entered the referee 's dressing room . One made as if to shake the referee 's hand , then socked him . Other Turks tried to beat up Italian players . Still mad , they wrecked their Athens hotel before leaving for Turkey , where the whole Turkish nation got into the fight . The Turkish ambassador called on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Istanbul demanding the return of Cyprus , the Dodecanese and Dedeagach . <P> One Turkish poster sneered at Turkey 's onetime Greek subjects : " You can all throw yourselves from the Acropolis rock , but you can not beat those who were your masters for over 500 years . " <P> Italy kept the Friendship Cup .
