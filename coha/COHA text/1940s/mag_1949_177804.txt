The world is so full of a number of things , <P> I 'm sure we should all be as happy as kings . <P> The professors of the " dismal science " have always scotched this sunny Stevenson couplet . To such economists as Thomas Robert Malthus and John Stuart Mill in the 19th Century and John Maynard Keynes in the 20th , the world did not seem so full . Any economic system , said the Mill school , would either become static or it would fail to provide for its own . Lesser Cassandras , including New Dealers , have foretold the depletion of the world 's oil and coal reserves , the exhaustion of soils , have pronounced the U.S. economy to be " mature , " i.e. , incapable of further expansion . Most of these experts offered some laws whereby , they held , a limited number of things could be fairly shared and regularly produced . They denied the possibility of burgeoning plenty ; instead , they promised " stability . " <P> Economist Harold G. Moulton , president of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book soberly titled Controlling Factors in Economic Development ( 397 pp. ; the Brookings Institution , Washington , D.C. ; $4 ) . On the strength of 30 years of his own study and the institution 's voluminous research , Moulton declares : 1 ) there is no known limit to the potential wealth of the world , and 2 ) there is no known method to assure economic stability . <P> Pleasure Boats &; Violins . Potentially , says Moulton , the natural resources and the productive capacity of the U.S. could , in the year 2049 , support a population of 300 million at a standard of living eight times as high as today 's . In this bright future , each American would spend eight times as much as he does today for food , 16 times for housing , 20 times for clothing , and 33 times for recreation and travel . <P> To supply these things , America 's factories and mines would have to produce between five and ten times as much as today , and its farms almost three times as much . Moulton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new areas can be brought under cultivation , swamps and deserts reclaimed ; he believes that certain crops could be raised in the fertile bed of the ocean . Fertilizers could increase farm output as much as the " discovery of a sixth continent . " <P> Better built , more attractive homes , more stylish and durable clothes could also be readily available . With precise enthusiasm , Prophet Moulton gives such detailed examples of potential progress as non-warp , non-scratch , non-splinter pleasure boats , and plastic violins which might all but rival the Stradivarius in tone . <P> Potential Paradise . The basic materials for such expansion seem adequate in the U.S. for centuries to come . U.S. coal seams will last for " thousands of years . " Known high-and medium-grade iron ore deposits in the U.S. will last 40 years , lower-grade ore some 600 years . Moulton also expects new deposits to be discovered . New techniques will further stretch existing supplies . Example : gas turbines are so cheap and efficient that one day a turbine the size of a dial telephone may power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
