BLACKOUT is not a precaution that you or I take merely in the hope of averting ersonal harm . As a matter of cold fact , this nation at war can not take the time to concern itself seriously about whether you or I as individuals are blotted out . What it does concern itself about is the safety of people in the mass . Blackout protection is not something that you or I can take or leave alone . You may have thought you would not bother with it , preferring to take your chances . But it is not a personal matter ; it is not your individual safety with which you would be taking chances , but the safety of your whole community and the life-or-death war effort of your country . It is unlikely that the vast area of the United States will ever have to be blacked out . Strategic sections will undoubtedly have to be prepared for instant protection of this kind . Civilian Defense units , working hand in hand with the military , will tell us what to do and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the booklet " Blackout " issued by the U. S. Office of Civilian Defense , is in no sense a plea to start hanging up black curtains . Do not rush out and stock up with materials for which you may not , after all , have any need , thereby causing shortages in locations that may have earlier need of them . Wait for the word from your local Civilian Defense authorities . Two great reasons are behind the blackout defense . The more obvious is protection ; the other , even more important , is production . In the early days of the war abroad , the  | banshee wail of the sirens drove most people from their occupations ; workers left their benches for deep shelters ; production stopped . With every alarm Britain lost many man-hours of work on planes , guns . munitions , tanks . That lesson was soon learned , and blackout , with the aid of camouflage , helps to keep production moving . Nor is it manufacturing only that must be preserved from interruption . The whole flow of our national life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , researcher , telephone operator , doctor ? will be maintained most effectively by intelligent use of blackout . Blackout is not a cure-all . On clear nights , even without moonlight , the location of a city can not be hidden . Rivers , lakes , reservoirs have reflecting surfaces that , with his maps , tell the airman a clear story . Flares that he drops are further aids . Nevertheless , blackout hides the pattern of streets , which would guide attacks on specific objectives . And in order that the heart of the city not be revealed by contrast with the scattered lights of residential sections , these too must be hidden . What will concern most of us is the job of blacking out our own dwellings . In most cases we can confine our activities during a blackout period to a few rooms ? perhaps to the kitchen alone . But outdoor lights , too easily forgotten or turned on by mistaking a switch , had better be robbed of their bulbs . Windows , in the rooms we shall need , are easily obscured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window-frame height , and wedging these between sill and top behind the vertical edges of the sash . The fabric should be of proper width to stretch tautly across the opening , and , when not in use , rolls up on the pair of sticks and is conveniently stored near-by . It also affords some protection against flying glass from an outside blast . Other devices for window  | protection are suggested in accompanying drawings . The danger of window breakage from blast , incidentally , may be halved by dropping the upper sash behind the lower one . Leave casement windows open . The general public is advised , on good authority , not to try blackening any windows in the home with paint . Heavy drapes , cardboard frames , or any other makeshift devices are equally good and may be removed in the daytime . For skylights , and factory windows which it is impossible to cover with the abovementioned devices , a paint may be prepared in the following manner : Reduce ordinary lampblack ( ground in oil ) with a mixture of 1 part good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turpentine . To facilitate removal , add a small amount of paraffin oil . Large panes of glass should have shockabsorbing materials applied . Adhesive strips of tough paper or fabric may be put on in a  | - lose pattern . The adhesive should remain slightly tacky . Ordinary flour paste to which is added five percent of glycerine or morasses , will serve . Tire tape or surgical adhesive tape make good reinforcement , spaced not over 6 inches apart each way . Destructive splintering of glass is sometimes avoided by wire netting of not over 12-inch openings , placed close to the glass . The factory brings additional difficulties in that skylights , saw-tooth and monitor roofs can not , in most cases , be permanently obscured . Loading platforms , truck garages , the need for frequent opening of outside doorways ? all these and similar danger points need special treatment . Once more , then , await the instructions of your Civil Defense unit . You may never need blackout precautions , but if and when your house or factory requires this protection , you will know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " how . "  |
