txt New York faces an unprecedented crisis in student housing by the end of this week when war veterans  --  many of them accompanied by their wives ? will pour into the city by the thousands to attend Columbia , Fordham and New York Universities and City College and other educational institutions . With college dormitory facilities overtaxed by regular students and early ex-GI registrants , the advance influx of men and women taking advantage of school benefits for veterans already has created a serious problem for the Y. M. C. A. and other organizations to whom the early arrivals have turned for shelter . The appeals for help last week by former service men seeking to prepare themselves for civilian careers led some of the besieged agencies to plan for a city-wide meeting of all interested agencies , including the State Department of Housing and the New York City Housing Authority , to discuss emergency steps to meet the demand ' for rooms . Final arrangements for the conference probably will be made tomorrow , with invitations going to the Travelers Aid Society , Y. M. C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , veterans ' organizations and other groups . The crisis is being intensified by delays in arrangements for emergency student housing at Camp Shanks and other central points . The trucking strike and shortage of equipment have set back the State program for such accommodations and have made it unlikely that these accommodations will be ready until next month . " We have been overwhelmed // with calls , and the schools also are wringing their hands , " said Lester L. Dobyns , program director of the branch of the Y. M. C. A. in West Twenty-third Street . " We hope to find some solution through a city-wide meeting . " Mr. Dobyns said appeals already had come from various student veterans who had been sleeping in railroad stations or had taken temporary makeshift quarters . In one instance , he reported , a married veteran who had hoped to get into Camp Shanks had to take a small hotel room at a price above his means , then suddenly found his wife had to go to a hospital to have a baby . Mother and child now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only the hotel room in which to live . Taking the leadership in supplying extra beds , the branch has provided dormitory space for forty men , with seven to fifteen to a room , all on one floor . The students have set up their own " community club " and have made rules about hours for sleep , study and other activities to provide as far as possible an atmosphere conducive to learning ) Accommodations in Branches Space for thirty more students will be set up in the same building to care for men who find that their $65 or so in monthly Government educational allotments will not go far in New York and who welcome dormitory quarters at $4 a week . William Sloane House and the Harlem " Y " are among the other branches planning similar accommodations , but their facilities will be only a drop in the bucket compared with the city-wide need in the face of the housing shortage , Mr. Dobyns explained . With City College reopening this week and Columbia , New York University and other institutions preparing to reopen next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the next ten days , some of the agencies declared . Opening of armories and other space for temporary shelter will be discussed at the proposed meeting . Also suggested has been an official appeal to New York families with spare rooms to open their homes at least temporarily to the veterans .
