txt James J. Caffrey , Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission , laid down a commendable , philosophy for the regulation of the security markets  --  and for Commission regulation generally ? in his talk here before the Association of Stock Exchange Firms . Discussing what he referred to as " the perennial complaint about restraints , " he minced no words . It was not the intention of the framers of the SEC laws , he reminded his listeners , to make the path of the securities seller easy . The standards reflected in that legislation , said he , " are standards that have been accepted as an integral part of the American way of life . " They would be valueless if administered in a halfhearted manner . On the other hand , he declared , it would be no less ruinous to the spirit of the law were it to be administered " unintelligently or vindictively . " And he added : " We at the Commission stand pledged to an honest administration , free of vindictiveness , and motivated by a constant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the law . " As evidence that he was not merely indulging in generalities , the SEC chairman outlined a number of modifications planned in the elaborate procedural requirements called for in the law in connection with the registration and sale of new issues of securities . Without undertaking a detailed discussion of these changes ( which are still in tentative form ) , it may be noted that they envisage , among other things , the complete scrapping of three forms of registration and the simplification of " Form S , " the one now most frequently employed . The plan calls for doing away with a large part of the material now supplied with respect to securities of the issuer other than the one being currently offered , much of the detailed information about the underwriting contract , and a great deal of historical background on the issuer that is readily available elsewhere . In other words , the proposals seek generally to reduce the present unnecessarily onerous requirements of the issuer to that of providing information that is genuinely pertinent , ' " We make these proposals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us , and because they are , in our opinion , utterly consistent with the interests of the public and of investors . " Time was when the Securities and Exchange Commission delighted in " riding herd " on Wall Street . It would not be fair to say that this was done in a spirit of vindictiveness . Indeed , it is even possible that in those lays before the financial community nad been broken to harness , as it were , such methods may have been desirable Ind necessary . But times change , and nstitutions with them . Recent years lave witnessed the development of a ; Teatly increased sense of responsibilty in the financial community , quite Tart from that coerced by Federal : egulation . " The community today , " Totes Mr. Caffrey , " is in basic agreenent with the standards of our laws . " Are believe this is an essentially accu.ate statement . And we should like xi add as our own unsolicited observaion that Mr. Caffrey , for his part , is me of the best of our living testinonials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age .
