The Soviet Government has often been grossly attacked in the U.S. press , which is free . But the controlled Russian press has almost never said a harsh word about the U.S. Government . It has behaved with the same correctness toward Britain 's Conservative Government . The Soviet press , however , never hesitates to exercise its claws on individual citizens of the big powers . Last winter Pravda kicked Wendell Willkie resoundingly in the pants and called him an " obedient speaking trumpet " ( he had mildly ventured to state that there is a Polish question ) . Pravda also mauled New York Times Military Commentator Hanson Baldwin , called him " admiral of an ink pool " ( Baldwin had said that Red Army advances were in part German retreats ) . <P> Last week it was William C. Bullitt 's turn . His offense : an article entitled The World from Rome ( LIFE , Sept. 4 ) . The article , a flesh-creeping look at postwar Europe , purported to be from the Roman point of view , but Mr. Bullitt was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . " The question in Roman minds , Bullitt reported , was whether the war would not end in the subjugation of Europe by Moscow instead of Berlin . <P> Hard Words . Promptly , Pravda lashed out in an editorial signed by K. Demidov , calling the former U.S. ambassador to Moscow and Paris " a liar " and " a spy . " <P> Demidov claimed that he had nailed 30 lies in the LIFE article . Three of them : <P> " Lie No. 1-Bullitt writes that the Polish Committee of Liberation is formed of 19 people , nine of whom are Communists , among them Osubka-Morawski its chairman . It is well known that there are only three Communists on this committee and that Osubka-Morawski is a member of the Workers ' Party of the Polish Socialists . " <P> " Lie No. 2-Bullitt writes that ' the Soviet Union will dominate Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania . ' How can the Soviet Union ' dominate ' Soviet Republics ? " <P> " Lie No. 3-Bullitt writes that Marshal Tito 's Army is ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received from America . ' By this lie Bullitt gives himself away as a spy who has assimilated the instructions of German Fascist propaganda . " <P> Harder Words . Two days later PM echoed Pravda in a three-page editorial by leftish Max Lerner , who could " not escape the slightly nauseating job of dissecting the rotten cadaver of Bullitt 's piece . " " Why ? " he asked rhetorically . " Because this " is the first time that anyone with a veneer of respectability , in a respectable paper , has uttered a direct call for a war between England and America on one side and Russia on the other . " <P> Ex-Ambassador Bullitt , now a major in the French Army , had uttered no such call . No human being in his senses wants a war between England and America on one side and Russia on the other . No human being in his senses wants war at all . But few sensible men saw much hope of lasting peace anywhere in the world if suspicions could not be aired and beaten out like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be couched in some warmer language than diplomacy , in cooler words than a curse .
