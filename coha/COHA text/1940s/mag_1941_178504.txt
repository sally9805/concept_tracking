One grey morning last week , as the rain beat down on southern France , three old men set out on a journey . For over a year Edouard Daladier , Lon Blum and Maurice Gustave Gamelin had been held at Riom , charged with the guilt of France 's destruction . Now , with their trial fixed for Jan. 15 , they were sped by automobile south to Portalet Fortress . There , two days later , they were joined by two other statesmen of the French Republic : Georges Mandel and Paul Reynaud . <P> In Portalet Fortress , gouged into a narrow chasm-side of the deep Pyrenees , they would read , ponder documents , peer out of windows through which-the sun never shines . Twice each day , in solitude , they would be permitted to pace the terrace above the gloomy , turreted fort. * <P> As they reflected on the dreary span of French history arched by their lives , they knew themselves prejudged . Trial proceedings , it was announced , would be published only as they touched on France 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war would be strictly secret . Thus Frenchmen would be told only that they were summoned to die almost weaponless by the leaders who were on trial . Frenchmen would learn nothing of the forces that compelled these old men to lead a weak , ailing nation to doom . <P> <P> - Not General Gamelin , said the Germans . D.N.B. <P> reported this week that the General had been taken to a hospital with erysipelas.
