txt DALADIER OBTAINS A UNANIMOUS VOTE French Chamber , After Secret Sessions on War Problems , Backs Premier 's Course By P. J. PHILIP Wireless to Tat NEW YORK TIMES . PARIS , Feb. ** above all party differences and all political discord the French Chamber of Deputies voted this evening by unanimity of the 534 members present that France is firmly united and resolved to defend her frontiers and her ideal of liberty in the world against all enemies . It was the first time since the war began that there had been a unanimous vote and the fact stands out as the most important outcome of the two-day secret session that preceded it . By its terms the motion before the House was a motion of confidence in the government . But it was much more than that . It was a motion by the representatives of the French people of defiance to Nazi Germany , of confidence in France and of reassurance to France 's allies . It was an indication to every one in this country and abroad , friend or foe , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that no enemies , acting from without or within , would change that decision . All Parties Sign Motion The motion that was voted was signed by the leaders of every party , from Jean Ybarnegaray and Louis Marin on the right to PierreEtienne Flandin in the center and Albert Chichery , presenting the Center Radical party , and Leon Blum with other Socialists on the Left . It paid homage to the efforts of the government to bring the material and moral forces of the country to the standard of heroism of the army , praised the conduct of the debate , which had been marked by its patriotism , and expressed confidence that the government would continue its efforts in collaboration with Parliament to carry on the war to victory . For the short ceremony of voting , the press and public were admitted to the Chamber galleries for the first time since Friday morning at 11 o'clock . All the doors to the Parliament building proper and the doors to the galleries had been locked for thirty-one hours . Only the Deputies were present within the House , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what they had said that led to this result is not likely to be published until long after the war is over . Some of the effects of these unrecorded speeches are likely , however , to be made apparent in the near future in acts . This unanimity is a new thing . It represents a political development of enormous importance and its consequences are clearly indicated to those who understand . When the gallery doors were opened and the few newspaper men // DALADIER-OBTAINS A UNANIMOUS VOTE // who had stood the siege rushed in to take their places they were greeted with laughter and some handclapping from the floor of the House , the Deputies turning around and waving a friendly welcome . It was obvious that every one was in a good humor . On his central bench Premier Edouard Daladier with all his Ministers took part in the greeting . No one who had not been inside the House knew what to expect . It was supposed the Premier would make some kind of public declaration and that there would be some speeches . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But Edouard Herriot , President of the Chamber , at once proceeded to read the motion and to ask for a vote . Only white papers were dropped into the urns . Here was something unexpected . It took only a few minutes to count them . " Five hundred thirty-four votes for the motion ; against , none , " read M. Herriot . Herriot Stresses Importance There was a burst of applause , silenced by M. Herriot , who remained standing . It was for him , as President of the Chamber , to do the summing up . M. Daladier did not speak . M. Herriot said : " This vote you have given will be of immense importance to your compatriots by the nobility of its unanimity . It - will be noted abroad by those who wish well and by those who wish ill to our country with very different feelings . " The debate that has occupied these last two days has enabled us to dissipate certain legends and establish the truth  --  the comforting truth . " It has permitted the Premier to explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was simple and familiar and by that fact infinitely moving . " It has finally permitted Parliament to play its full role as an assembly representing all the parties in France . In two days there has been confirmed in decisive fashion our national unanimity which is inalienable because it is founded on liberty and the passionate love of country . " The whole House rose and cheered its President as a further expression of the unanimity that it had shown by its vote . The terms of the interpellations , which were announced yesterday morning before the secret session began , indicate clearly that among the subjects debated were the attitude of the country as a whole to the war and the conduct of the war . Those who raised this question did not do so in a hostile spirit , but because of their fears that all classes were not responding with their full force to the country 's cause because they felt the government did not represent the whole electorate . Next in order of importance came the question of ammunition supplies and the production of airplanes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Premier Daladier let it be known yesterday that it was because Air Minister Guy Lachambre wanted a discussion on the aviation situation that he had consented to the secret sessions . Many other angles of the question of the conduct of the war by the government also came within the scope of the five different interpellations that were scheduled , and these , with the replies given by the government undoubtedly opened still more .
