The Y.W.C.A. is no longer exclusively C. That was the big news of the 50th anniversary of the World 's Young Women 's Christian Association , celebrated last week in some 400 U.S. cities and a dozen foreign lands . <P> The Y.W. now flourishes in 53 nations , with some 1,500,000 members . Their activities range from sports to classes in stenography , from providing board &; room for city working girls to running summer vacation camps for youngsters . Currently the Y.W. is hard at work in war zones , with some 20 rest and recreation centers ( including a houseboat on the Nile at Cairo ) which provide servicewomen with such occasional luxuries as breakfast in bed , hairdressers , tearooms . <P> But as the Y.W. 's good works have multiplied , its emphasis on religious activities has waned . It now includes many a non-Christian in Asia . And in the U.S. , the Y.W. 's famed Bible classes are a thing of the past .                  @ @ @
