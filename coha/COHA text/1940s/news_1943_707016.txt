txt Recollecting the sorry and , catastrophic mess produced in 1919 by conflict between the executive and legislative branches of the United States Government over the peace settlement , it stands to reason that great import attaches to- the proposal now under consideration by Senator Clark of Missouri to place Congress on record now regarding post-war commitments . It is obvious that an open and sincere stand by the Senate and the House at this stage would be of enormous aid to the negotiators which the executive branch will name to make peace , especially considering the circumstance that there appears a real sentiment throughout the country in favor of the establishment of peacekeeping machinery in which this country will be expected to make definite and long-term contractualpledges . This ' would be true from both a national and international point of view . A strong vote in both houses would have the effect , it might be expected , of binding both parties to a program of international cooperation . If this could be accomplished , it would make much more difficult the task of isolationists who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It would also constitute a commitment which might weigh heavily , to the advantage of the President and his delegates in their dealing with our associates of the , United Nations . They would be able to meet their associates at the peace conference protected , at least in large part , from the inevitable question of whether we will go through with what we promise , rather than retreating , as we did the last time . The Story of 1919 It will be perfectly idle for us to expect the governments of other nations to forget 1919 . After the Allied nations had accepted the League of Nations plan of President Wilson , after it had been tied up with the Peace Treaty , after France had surrendered her claim , to the left bank of the Rhine in exchange for a promised ' tri-partite pact by which the United States and Britain would come to her aid if attacked again by Germany , we I wrecked the whole edifice by retiring into isolation . How could that be forgotten ? For example , it is certainly no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Downing Street are even today considering the situation which may arise in , the event of peacetable conflict between the United States and Russia . Such a conflict might arise over the Baltic States , over Poland , or a dozen other issues . That would be but natural because , there are always rival and conflicting national claims at any peace conference . And it would pose a problem for the British , who have a twentyyear treaty of alliance with Mos-. cow . Who will then deny that it is but natural for the British to consider the probabilities of American action after the war is over ? " If we are to go wholeheartedly into cooperation with Britain and the other United Nations , that will be one situation . If we are to play the same game as last time , that is quite evidently another situation , so far as the British are concerned . Where Will We Stand ? What is true of ' Britain is true of the other countries now united with ours in the job of crushing the Axis . True ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is that they have the declared intention ' of President Roosevelt to put this country into collaboration for the maintenance of peace . But they had as much-from President Wilson , and he was - just as sincere about it as is President Roosevelt . But can we blame our Allies for recalling that we have a national election next year ? Both the President and the Congress might change , and they have to take that factor into consideration . Therefore , an overwhelming bipartisan vote by the Senate , which must confirm treaties , and by the House , which must supply the funds , would , be of vast importance . But , by the same token , unless the vote is overwhelming the matter would take on a different aspect . For this reason , Senator Clark or any other leader who undertakes to place the Congress on . record will probably be moved to ascertain ahead of time what sort of a. vote there would be . But , any way one may look at it , there would be significance in Congress committing itself now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present making such an enormous contribution to the effort of the United Nations . Lodge 's Round-Robin Yet it should be again emphasized that the commitment must be concrete and not too general. - In March of 1919 thirty-seven Republican Senators , more than the one-third which could block any treaty , signed a round-robin , addressed in effect to the world at large , declaring against the League of Nations as it had been drafted . These Senators , who were to sit in the Senate which would consider the League , stuck to their guns and carried out their fight against the League successfully . Thereby they contributed to the destruction . of the only answer which came out of the Paris Peace Conference " to the World-wide cry that something be done to prevent such a war happening again . And thereby they contributed no little to the causation of the present war . But that very resolution , framed by the late Senator Lodge , stated that the Senators concerned were in favor of some sort of international machinery to preserve peace . Only they were against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only thing in sight at the time they swore against it . So now the question arises of whether a general statement , by the Congress would mean everything it should mean . Even Lodge said he was for some kind of international collaboration . Perhaps very few in Congress would today oppose a statement of a very general kind . What is needed is something positive and definite . Need for a Plan Now That brings US- up against the circumstances that there is rertirt existence today a definite plan to which the Congress of the public could promise support and adherence . Thus there is a strong point in the declarations by the State Department that we advocate quick consultation among the United Nations governments for the preparation of post-war plans or else , as Mr. Welles puts it , we shall approach a peace conference which will have before it as many plans as there ' are governments ' involved . In other words , what is it that Congress can now espouse ? " Collective Security " is mentioned in the resolution under consideration by ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Collective Security . " The question is not the principle but the practice . What are we going to do about " Collective Security ? " Are we willing to contribute to , an international police force ? If so , what sort of police force ? Who would command that police force ? Would it be subject  --  to an international command which could act independently of national governments ? Are we in favor of an international legislative or executive body which would have sovereign powers or would we limit our role to a plan of cooperation by national governments ? The League was machine for the cooperation of national governments . Would we go further now ? - It may be argued that it is difficult now to answer such details . In reply it may be pointed out that it is just such details which involve the basic considerations of national sovereignty and it is on just such details that a plan might stand . or fall. - So.whyinot have ar-plan.Z                 @ @ @ @
