Even Colonel Robert S. Allen , the onetime Washington columnist who lost an arm in Germany-and the most outspoken critic of present artificial limbs-was mollified last week . Colonel Allen had lunch with six other amputees , Congresswoman Edith Nourse Rogers , and Major General Paul R. Hawley of the Veterans ' Administration , the man responsible for veterans ' artificial limbs . Some time during the two-hour lunch , General Hawley made Allen chairman of a committee of amputees to pass on new prostheses ( artificial devices ) , and told him to pick his own committee . <P> There was other hopeful action for crippled veterans : <P> General Hawley announced that the Veterans ' Administration-for the first time in history-plans to spend $1,000,000 a year for prosthetic research . Walter Bura , a 31-year-old civilian amputee with a bent for engineering , was appointed chief of the VA Division of Prosthetic Devices with the job of speeding new inventions to the wearable stage . Bura , who walks so well himself that no one realizes his leg is off above the knee , is credited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teaching amputees to walk. * <P> A House subcommittee report , just out , gives an eleven-point program for improving artificial devices and smoothing the way for their purchase and repair . <P> <P> *Research on hands is not so pressing . The Miracle Hand , for instance , is excellent if properly attached to a good , lightweight arm : the fingers move separately and can pick up any thing from a toothpick to a chair .
