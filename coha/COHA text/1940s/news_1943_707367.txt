txt The Administration suffered a setback today when the House Banking and Currency Committee voted , 16 to 10 , to prohibit all subsidies on food after Dec. 31 . The action , taken over the protest of Marvin Jones , War Food Administrator , sent the subsidy issue to the House floor and assured another prolonged fight between the President and the farm group over the farm and food prices . The House may take up the matter week after next . The committee action followed a stormy session behind closed doors . Later , one member of the group , Representative Patman , Democrat , of Texas , declared heatedly that the subsidy ban would cost consumers " ten or fifteen billion dollars a year " and that it meant " ruinous , runaway inflation for the nation . " The prohibition against subsidies was inserted into a bill to extend the life of the Commodity Credit Corporation , a War Food Administration agency which handles most farm-subsidy programs , beyond Dec. 31 , 1943 . The committee . headed by Representative Henry B. Steagall of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agency to Dec. 31 , 1945 , but they acted to put it and the Reconstruction Finance Corporation out of the subsidy business after the end of this year . Under Section 3 of the bill , sub-1 sidies in operation or announced October 13 might continue until December 31 but no new subsidies on agricultural products or byproducts could be started . The expenditures on food-subsidy programs announced or in contemplation have been estimated at about $600,000,000 annually . The only exceptions to the prohibition would be subsidy programs on soy beans , flaxseed and peanuts and the vegetable oil seeds , and the fact that Commodity Credit might sell fruits and vegetables which it owns at less than their purchase price in order to prevent shortage and waste . Not only would the subsidy ban put an end to programs now in operation at CCC and the RFC but it would prevent ceiling prices on agricultural products at less than support prices . The effect of this would be to demolish Mr. Jones ' support-price program for 1944 . Under it he planned , through the use of subsidies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices on farm or food products . Price Increases Predicted When the committee voted , it had before it a letter from Mr. Jones , dated today , in which he predicted that the proposed restriction would increase the price of butter five cents a pound , cheese about four cents a pound , some varieties of ' dry beans $1.20 a hundred pounds and sugar one-half cent a pound , and would boost the price of canned vegetables and pork pr3ducts . All eleven Republican members of the Banking and Currency Committee voted with one Progressive , Representative Hull of Wisconsin , and four Democrats for the subsidy ban . Chairman Steagall voted for the prohibition , as did Representative Brown of Georgia and Representative Baldwin of Maryland , but the identity of the other Democrat who voted against the Administration was not revealed . The committee session was stormy and so was the impromptu press conference which followed it . Mr. Steagall explained the committee 's action briefly , but while he was doing so Representative Patman and Representative Wright , Democrat of Pennsylvania , interrupted several times to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it were allowed to stand .
