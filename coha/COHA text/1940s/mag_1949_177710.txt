" Every bullet , every item , has been planned because of a particular need for this somewhere . If you cut it , you will not achieve some vital purpose . " So Secretary of State Dean Acheson told the House Foreign Affairs Committee last week in his precise and impressive manner . <P> Lacking any current evidence of Russian marauding , the Administration was doing its considerable best to imbue its $1,450,000,000 military-aid progam with an air of urgency and inviolability . Said Acheson : " The Soviet Union today maintains the largest peacetime military force in the history of the world . . . The combination of ... a huge aggressive force on one side and admittedly inadequate defense forces on the other has created a morbid and pervasive sense of insecurity in Western Europe . The fear is justified . The danger is real , however much some may try to argue it out of existence . " <P> Acheson insisted that the bill contained " the minimum amount required " to equip " the very modest forces " which Europe had on hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all-out attack : " What is required is rather sufficient strength to make it impossible for an aggressor to achieve a quick and easy victory . " <P> Hard Core . To bolster Acheson , the U.S. 's highest brass marched up to Capitol Hill . Army Chief of Staff Omar Bradley , flanked by the Navy 's Admiral Denfeld and the Air Force 's General Hoyt Vandenberg , spoke for the Joint Chiefs of Staff . Said Missouri-born Omar Bradley , whose vivid prose is the match of Acheson 's : " We can surely anticipate that any aggressor will alternatively press and quell the crises , hoping to hold the North Atlantic Treaty powers in perpetual irresolution . But irresolution has no apology . It is born of fear and selfishness and of such meanness that all despise it . " <P> The Joint Chiefs , he told John Kee 's House Committee , had reviewed all European requests in the light of certain basic strategic assumptions . Among them : 1 ) " The U.S. will be charged with the strategic bombing . . . The first priority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atomic bomb . " 2 ) " England , France , and the closer countries will have the bulk of the short-range attack bombardment and air defense . " 3 ) " The hard core of the ground power in being will come from Europe . " The program , Bradley said , was " an opportunity to gain , at a minimum expense , additional measures for our own security . " <P> No Plan . Few legislators disputed the need for military aid ; but many were critical of the manner , timing , and amount . Harry Truman had asked for virtually a free hand to allocate arms and money wherever and whenever he thought they were needed , on whatever terms he chose . Administration spokesmen admitted that they could not estimate accurately how long the program might run , or how much it would ultimately cost .
