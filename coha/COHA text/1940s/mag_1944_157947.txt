To the office of every U.S. general in SHAEF ( Supreme Headquarters , Allied Expeditionary Force ) in Britain last week went a neat , sealed package from Washington . Inside each package was an elegant calfskin belt with pistol holster and a big shiny buckle embossed with the U.S. seal . <P> The generals admired the belts , tried them on for size . Snorted a two-star general : " Hell of a thing or the field-a sniper could pick out the buckle at 1,000 yards . " A brigadier general gloomed : " No good as a shaving strap either-all that stitching . " Having received no instructions on what to use the belts for , the generals concluded that somebody in Washington was designing a wardrobe for the march down the Wilhelmstrasse . The belts were tossed in bottom drawers .
