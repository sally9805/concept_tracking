Churchill wants to take Berlin , but General Eisenhower disagrees . The Germans start negotiations . Then  --  the great day of May 7 , 1945 ! ( With this issue , the Post completes the publication of selected material from Captain Butcher 's great war diary . The full diary , as edited by Captain Butcher , will be brought out as a 900-page book , in April , by Simon &; Schuster . It has also been chosen as a Bookof-the-Month Club selection . I Sunday . turn a 19 in . Corporal Street , my driver , got us to Luxemburg last Monday night , where Colonel Scott-Bailey , Virgil Pinkley , of the U.P. , and I stayed at the Alfa Hotel . Omar Bradley , as always , kind and courteous , sat us down in front of his operations map and described the battle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Western Germany , because the Reich is undergoing mass destruction . He said that if Kesselring reports the true situation , he must inform the German High Command that the Wehrmacht can no longer hold any line . I was amused when General Bradley replied to my question as to when his headquarters would move forward , this being important to public-relations plans . He said he had intended to move to Bad Ems , a popular watering place just east of Coblenz . But the Air Force , not being privy to his plans , unfortunately , had bombed all the good buildings . From Luxemburg , we drove northeast through Bitburg , Prum , Blankenheim , Euskirchen and Bonn to Bad Godesburg . We crossed the Rhine Wednesday morning on a pontoon bridge a few hundred yards downstream from the famous Remagen bridge , with its center span now hanging from its stone piers , twisted and crumpled . General Bradley told us that , at the time the bridge fell , it had not been used for five days , as pontoon bridges already were in service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S. Navy were plying the river , which seemed as peace-fin as the Navy training base at the Great Lakes . Frankfurt was all the RAF and the 8th Air Force said it war , but seeing is most convincing . While Street changed a tire , we wandered into a factory building . There were two main workrooms , each perhaps 200 feet long and 100 wide . The building was severely damaged and machinery had been removed . But the thing that interested me most was a cement blockhouse in the wall between the two large workrooms . In it , one guard with a gun could watch the workers  --  no doubt slaves  --  in both rooms . Saw General Patton and asked if he had seen the latest issue of Time . He had n't . So I read to Min the part where I was reported as having " ordered " him , a three-star General , to make peace with a three-stripe soldier , Mauldin , the cartoonist . Fortunately , he enjoyed my discomfiture at the misquotation . But when I read him the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not convinced General Patton , and was certain that Patton had n't convinced him , that was too much . In his high-pitched voice Patton said , " Why , if that little so-and-so ever comes in the Third Army area again , I 'll throw him in jail . " We found we could drive to the east of the Ruhr pocket to Paderborn , where we could turn west and follow the main supply route of the 9th Army until we recrossed the Rhine at Wesel . Following our map carefully , we stayed in the corridor that showed clear of the enemy . We passed come batteries of American artillery along the road to Frankenburg . I figured we must be eight or ten miles from the Ruhr front , but in the town we saw two bodies of Yanks and a couple of dead horses , convincing signs that the town recently had been under enemy artillery fire . Crews of tanks waiting on the road seemed alert , but we passed on , having checked our map to make certain we were on the proper road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which we could see down the valley ; it was under shellfire . Buildings were burning and there were sounds of small-arms fire . Rounding a bend , we found three American tanks knocked out and the road blocked with other tanks waiting for our artillery to complete its preparation for their plunge into the town when the disabled tanks were removed . We decided we had gone far enough on this road , and Street managed to turn the car around and head back . We returned to Reims Saturday in time for lunch . I found that Ike intended to push Bradley 's 12th Army Group straight eastward from Kassel to the Leipzig area , to split the Germans on the Western Front . When the Russian drive reaches the Dresden-Leipzig area and joins up with the Americans , the division of the Germans will be complete . Monty 's 21st Army Group , strengthened by one American corps , is to clean up the Germans on the northern coast and to push on to Liibeck on the Baltic Sea , in an effort to prevent the Germans from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' 6th Army Group , with Patton 's 3rd Army on its left flank , is to move southeast toward the Southern Redoubt . I told the Supreme Commander that I had heard comment from the correspondents , officers and G. I. 's that they wanted to keep going until they got to Berlin . This desire is rampant . Ike said it is much more important militarily to divide the Germans and to prevent them from continuing to fight in Denmark and Norway or in the Southern Redoubt . He was apprehensive that if Hitler and his small group of Nazi leaders could hole in around Berchtesgaden , they could by radio assert command over outlying garrisons and thus continue the war . The taking of Berlin would be a mere show ; what he wanted to do was to end the war as quickly and economically in lives as possible . Paris . Tuesday . April 10 , 10-15 . I was at the Express Building trying to catch up on my delinquent planning , when General Ike phoned me from Reims about five o'clock and asked , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much . He said he thought he would come down to spend the night . " Suits me fine , " I said . He 'd leave the airfield near Reims in 20 minutes and I could meet him at Orly . It took me almost as long to drive to Orly as the Supreme Commander needed to fly from Reims . I told Corporal Street we were going to get the Supreme Commander and take him to the Raphael . " You mean we 're going to get General Eisenhower in this car ? " Our regular car had been turned in for repairs and we had been given temporary use of a Ford . En route to Orly , the Rue des Italiens was crowded with people waiting to see someone important . This is the street by which I would have to return with General Ike . When I reached Orly , I found a French guard with arms stacked , waiting for a VIP . I soon found it was a VGDIP  --  General de Gaulle himself , whose plane was due to arrive about the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arranged to have Major Hansen radioed to taxi the General 's plane to the far side of the apron . I found that capable Tex Lee had phoned the secretariat at SHAEF Main at Versailles to have a car standing by for the crew . It was a handsome Packard . General Ike and the faithful Mickey , with an overnight bag , stepped from the plane to the Ford , and we left Orly by a side exit . We still had to traverse the streets where crowds were lined to greet de Gaulle , and I was apprehensive that the Supreme Commander would be recognized . But we traveled the entire distance across the city and not a soul paid him the slightest attention . Paris , WegInemrlay , April U , 11 ) - 45 . At last things seem happy at Stars and Stripes . Today I had a letter from Lt. Col. Arthur Goodfriend , the editor in chief , saying that thanks to me , the S &; S is , at long last , " liberated . " His thanks really are to General Ike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the staff of Stars and Stripes is not pestered by the brass . To make certain that those above Colonel Goodfriend understood his policy , the Supreme Commander had written the same day to Gen. Oscar Sol bert , Chief of Special Services , ETOUSA , a letter which would protect him when be , too , sought to shield the editorial staff . A subsequent letter to the Deputy Theater Commander , Lt. Gen. Ben Lear , said in part : A great deal of pressure has been brought on me in the past to abolish such things as Mauldin 's cartoons , the " B " Bag , etc . You will make sure that the responsible officer knows he is not to interfere in matters of this kind . If he believes that any specific violation of good sense or good judgment has occurred , ho may bring it to my personal attention . It looks to me as if General Patton may now admit he has lost the battle of Mauldin . Pawl* , Wednenday , April lit , 19.15 Drove to Reline yesterday morning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engagement to see the Prime Minister . Ike had just returned from his visit in the forward area with the let and 3rd armies . He had taken time to see the collection of German treasures in a salt mine . I reminded him that once , at Gibraltar , he and Mark Clark had talked of absconding with American expense money if TORCH proved unsuccessful . He said there was plenty of expense money in the German cache , but the gold bars were too heavy to carry . He knew , because he 'd tried to lift one . He had gone to one of the German internment camps near Gotha , and had seen the cruel and ghastly treatment given the inmates . He had interviewed several through an interpreter , and said that their stories of starvation , cruelty and bestiality were so overpowering that he felt sick . In one room he had seen twenty to thirty naked men killed by starvation . Patton had refused to enter . Said he would upchuck if he did , but Ike said he had forced himself to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have firsthand evidence to combat anyone in the future who would say that stories of the atrocities were " propaganda . " I told Ike of the flurry at PRD among the censors because General Patton had arbitrarily fired one of them for passing stories that we had captured some of the German loot and of an expedition Patton had ordered to liberate some American prisoners . General Ike said he had had this chapter and verse while he was visiting Patton , and had made clear to " Georgie " that he had no right to relieve a SHAEF censor , over whom he has no authority anyway . Ike had taken Patton 's hide off . But I think Patton must have as many hides as a cat has lives , for this is at least the fourth time that General Ike has skinned his champion end runner . In England , Ike visited Churchill and returned to our quarters before midnight . The Prime Minister wants him to take Berlin . Ike sees no military sense in it . This morning I drove with him to the annex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting with Churchill and the British Chiefs of Staff . When the meeting finished , the Prime Minister walked with General Ike to the car . He was as homey as neighbors on adjoining Iowa farms . As we drove away , Ike said the Prime Minister always walked to the car with him , sometimes in his bathrobe . Ike has grown very fond of Churchill and , although they occasionally differ on military questions , they are the best of friends . Ike had given the Prime Minister and the British Chiefs a fill-in on his operations in Germany , but one of the questions requiring decision , not by Ike but by the home governments , arose from a request from the French that they be given a larger zone of occupation . They wanted some area east and most of the territory west of the Rhine . With respect to the insistence that our forces capture Berlin , Ike still thinks it more important that we clean up the important jobs on our flanks . The main job in the north is to get to Lubeck , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . The other is the so-called " redoubt . " In view of the relative situation of the Russians and ourselves at this time , it would be foolish to rush to Berlin . We could get our forces all coiled to spring for Berlin , and in all probability the Russians would already have it . He prefers that the center of his long line stand fast on the Elbe . Another point discussed was the propriety of the Supreme Commander dealing directly with the Russians . Direct communications had been established between the Supreme Commander and the Chief of Staff of the Red Army in Moscow , Antonov , by Air Chief Marshal Tedder during his mission there . But a question involving boundaries of areas to be occupied goes beyond the sphere of military headquarters . The British want communications with the Russians to flow from Suaev , through the combined Chiefs , to Moscow , rather than direct . As the two ground forces draw together , there would be many details to be ( Continued on Page 82 ) When a girl just stands and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do . It involves the use of both arms , and the routine is simple , effective and guaranteed to work . Anyone who knows all about women knows that . Stony just stood there . " I thought , " said Ann , " that you knew all the answers . " MY THREE YEARS WITH EISENHOWER f Con lerined from Puke 291 arranged with the Russians , and General Ike needed direct contact with them , so he stood pat , in so far as communications were needed on purely military matters . Paris , Saturday , April 21 , 19.15-I dined with Beetle and Ike last night at Beetle 's house in Versailles . It is modernistic , and from the outside looks like a long box . Inside , it is strictly utilitarian . It is laid out something like a Pullman car , with compartments on one side and an aisle alongside . Beetle laughed when I recalled the time I was flying with him from Tunis to Algiers in dirty weather . We were dying in heavy rain , which we had been unable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We had tried both . The pilot , fresh from combat , had gone down low over the water and had flirted with a convoy of ships , some of which carried barrage balloons . It looked as if we could n't land at Algiers , but would have to go on to Oran or back to Tunis . I was standing behind the pilot , as if I could be of any help , and Beetle was sitting in the only seat , just behind me . He reached up , touched use on the shoulder and said , " Tell the pilot he does n't have to go through just because there 's a major general aboard . " Paris , Friday , April 27 , 1915 , At Reims yesterday , sat in with a group of editors and publishers from the States when Ike talked to them . They had seen the Buchenwald concentration camp and had interviewed liberated American prisoners . The Supreme Commander and the editors compared notes on their visits to the " hell camps . " Ike said he hoped every American newspaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The editors were interested in knowing the manner in which the end of the war would be declared . Ike said there would be no V-E proclamation as long as any major German forces face the Allies . " V-E day is going to be a clay of relief for a lot of soldiers and their families , " he told them . " I do n't believe we should have that relief until we are sure that our men are not losing their lives trying to defeat large numbers of enemy forces which may be dug in somewhere . " Paris , Tursday , May 2 , 2945 . Things are really getting on . The 1st Army has linked up with the Russians at Torgau on the Elbe . Rumors of peace are sweeping Allied capitals . Moscow has announced that Himmler had offered to surrender unconditionally to the United States and Britain , but his proposal has been rejected because it did ' not include Russia . At Reims I found General Ike is working on redeployment . Hodges and his 1st Army staff are ? to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is finished . Patton once had a corn- " That was yesterday , " said Stony . He did n't know any of the answers . But when the right one moved into his arms with her head on a level with his heart , he did know enough to hang on tight . Intuitive , that was him . " Ann , " said Stony , in the snappiest bit of dialogue he had ever achieved , " I love you . " THE END mitment from the late President to go to the Pacific . Do n't know what will happen now . Georgie always said he wanted to die fighting . The Supreme Commander has another French problem on his hands . For reasons of pride , the French let Army , under General de Lattre de Tassigny , declined to evacuate Stuttgart , which is needed as a link in the supply and communication system supporting current operations of Patch 's 7th Army . Under the circumstances , General Ike accepted the situation , as he was unwilling to take any action at this late date in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two countries . Paris , Thursday , May a , 1015 . The psychological boys were quick on the trigger . They suggested that General Ike issue a statement to give the German people in the world facts to disabuse their minds that Hitler died a hero . The Supreme Commander authorized the issuance of a statement . General Ike sent his plane for me last evening , and with Caacie we went to Reims in style . I had Caacie plucked in a French shop which specializes in trimming poodles into fantastic shapes . Caacie was a sight . The General was disgusted . Telek and the four pups were elated . They chased and bedeviled her for an hour . Ike and Jim Gault had just returned from the office when I arrived , and were talking about the surrender of the Germans in Italy . Berlin also-had been taken by the Russians , but the news did n't seem surprising . I was pleased , though , when I learned that the Italian campaign had ended so gloriously for Alexander and Clark and everyone who fought in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his broadcast and newsreel speech for V-E day . He had drafted it and redrafted it three times , with Telek and the pups vying for attention and , as usual , having no respect for the dignity of the Su. pre me Commander . He read his script . Jim Gault made a suggestion here and there , and I had one or two , but it needed little change . He did n't have to learn , it for the recording , but for the movie he would have a few paragraphs to give from memory . This , I knew , would not be difficult , for once he had dictated and reworked a piece , even though it 's a couple of thousand words , he can repeat its thought immediately , almost word for word . The speech having been read , criticized and reread , we relaxed . Ike still has as his No. 1 plan his often-expressed desire to sit on the bank of a quiet stream and fish . I told Ike he seemed slated to be Chief of Staff and reminded him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a probability . Ike thought he might be of greater use to his country if he could resign , not merely retire , from the Army and devote himself to supporting proper military preparedness of the United States . He wants to be in a position to speak freely without even the trace of restriction that might be present if he were ( Continued on Pogo 81 ; THE SATURDAY EVENING POST February 16,1946 Continued from Page 82 ) simply a retired rather than a resigned officer . He insists that America and Britain should continue to work together in peace as they have in war . America , he thinks , has much to gain by remaining friendly to Britain , because among other reasons , the British statesmen have the foresight to maintain bases . In America , there will be a revolt against spending , curtailment of appropriations will become popular with members of Congress , and the armed services are likely to go through the same withering process as after the last war . There is much streamlining that can be done to the land , sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is convinced the country would be best served if we had the same unity of command of these services in peacetime as has been demonstrated to be so effective in the war . Even West Point and Annapolis might well be merged into one national institution and thus avoid the rivalries inherent in the system of competition between the two . All young men should be taught how to defend themselves and their country . A year of military service for young men would contribute to their education , and the discipline would be good for them . The evening ended with my reminder to Ike that he had frequently talked about getting out of the Army , but when and if the President says to him , " You are to be the Chief of Staff of the United States Army , " there is no doubt in my mind that he will respond to the call of duty . Ike growled , called for Mickey to take Telek out , and ambled up the stairs to bed , with the manuscript in his hand which would be his " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May .1 . 19 13 . At lunch , at the Chatham , I had an uneasy feeling that somewhere something was happening that I was missing . In the corridor I was stopped by Lieutenant Colonel Duncan Clark , the American censor , who said he had just received a phone call from 21st Army Group guardedly saying : " We 've got everything in hand , the correspondents are all set , and it looks as if everything will go off as scheduled . " Clark said it was a mystery to him . Did I know anything about it ? I imagined it was about a surrender ceremony and , on checking by phone with Colonel Gault at Reims , got enough information to confirm my suspicion . Corporal Street and I were in Reims in two hours . The atmosphere at SHAEF Forward was tense . Ike was waiting for a phone call from Monty . At five minutes of seven , he said he thought he might just as well go home and wait there . Wac Lieutenant Kay Summershy , his personal secretary , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes ? The call may come . " At seven o'clock it came . " Fine . Fine . That 's fine , Monty , " Ike said , as Kay and I eavesdropped in his office . Ike told Monty if the Germans had authority of Doenitz to stop all the fighting , to send them to Reims . Details are to be worked out between the two Chiefs of Staff , Beetle and " Freddie " de Guingand . Then he was ready to go home to dinner . As we walked down the private stairway from the Supreme Commander 's office on the second floor and through the large entrance hall , Telek and the General played their usual game , Telek running ahead about thirty feet , skidding to a stop and rushing back to the General , barking the joy that only a dog can sense so quickly . The solemn RAF guard and the American MP 's stood stiffly at attention . But they grinned as they saluted . Before dinner there was a call from Beetle that the Germans were being flown from Monty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saturday morning , weather permitting . I asked Ike if he himself would sign the instrument of surrender if the Germans had authority to give up all the German forces to both the Russians and to us . Ike said he would n't even see them until after they had signed . He did n't want to bargain ; that he was going to tell them , through his staff , what to do and would see them only after they had signed on the dotted line . I was , however , worried about press , radio and movie coverage of the event , but the Supreme Commander bad all on his mind he ought to bear , and I was n't going to bother him with this problem at this late hour . If the Germans come simply to negotiate , the correspondents ca n't be in on this anyway , so there was little I could tell PRO , except that news was in the making , but I would keep in touch and let them know as soon as possible when and if correspondents could be sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PRO , journalists in cis vilian life , are coming to cover developments for later use of all correspondents . SIIIAEF Forward Ille11110d , Sadurdny , May 5. 111 ? 15 . By the time I was dressed this morning , Ike had been on the telephone with Beetle . There might be a change in plans . The weather was bad ; the plane bringing the Germans might not get to Reims . It might be necessary to take General Ike 's train , standing by at Reims , to an intermediate point near an airfield where the weather was sufficiently clear to permit a landing . Miinchen-Gladbach was discussed . We breakfasted quickly . Was at the office by 8:45 . I found the PRD officers waiting , briefed them on the overnight messages and latest dope I could pick up from G-2 and G-3 . It looked a bit as if the actual signing could take place today , but it might be on a train . I asked Ike if correspondents could go on the train , and he said that if there was actually to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " lay them in the aisles , " if necessary . From the secretariat , we learned that the German party consists of Admiral Hans Georg von Friedeburg , who now is said to be Commander in Chief of the German Navy , succeeding Admiral Doenitz , and former commander of the German Submarine Service , and Col. Fritz Poleck , of the Oberkommando Wehrmacht , which is the German equivalent of the U. S. War Department or the British War Office . About 11:00 , we heard from the airfield that the weather was still bad , and that if the plane was corning in there , it was overdue . About noon , I learned from the secretariat that the plane carrying the Germans had landed near Brussels , the party would have lunch there and would drive to Reims . Now that we know the Germans definitely are coming to our headquarters , the War Room has been designated as the place for the ceremony , when , as and if . I have talked with Gen. " Pinky " Bull , G-3 , about arrangements , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it confirmed by Beetle , that if negotiations take place in the War Room , we may bring in correspondents in time for any signature . Photographs may be taken when the Germans enter the room , and again as they leave , but if any conversations are to take place before the Germane have indicated their assent to sign , then all photographers , radio men and correspondents must clear the room . This seemed a bit awkward and would create confusion . Beetle solved the problem by saying that all preliminary discussions will take place in his office , and unless the Germans agree and are authorized to sign , they will not be taken into the War Room . Lunch was quiet , Ike being contemplative as to the dilemma he would be in if the Russians refused to accept the surrender . He has messages from Antonov , Chief of Staff of the Red Army , communicated through the Military Mission to Moscow , headed by General Dean , which seemed to give him authority , but which are not absolutely clear . In any event , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ike will not accept any terms from the Germans which are not equally applicable to the Russians . I have been using the office set aside for VIP 's . I was crowded out of my office this afternoon when the two Russian representatives arrived . They were Maj. Gen. Ivan Susloparoff , an artillery officer who normally is head of the Russian Mission to France , and his round-headed interpreter , Col. Ivan Zenkovich , who has a shiny bald head without a hair on it . The sound and picture people arrived and I got them cleared past the guard into the War Room , and arranged to let them come and go , which was something of a triumph . The War Room , where Ike generally has met with his top commanders and staff each morning at 9:00 , is now strewn with cable , camera equipment and batteries of klieg Lights . The photographers generally take command wherever they go into action , and they had pushed a huge table , normally in the center of the room , to a far corner to permit more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German party arrived . They were met by Brig . E. J. Foord , of G-2 , and Lt. Col. K. A. S. Morrice , Assistant Secretary of the General Staff , both of whom had spent the day waiting to perform their duty , after having stayed at the airfield until noon . Both were British officers , and they saluted smartly , the two Germane responding promptly and precisely , but I noticed the Germans did n't use the Nazi salute . Scores of our personnel quietly watched the proceeding . They were brought to an office on our floor , two or three doors down and across the corridor to one I usually occupy . Fawley said the German Admiral was humming softly as he washed up and changed his collar , but Colonel Poleck appeared nervous . I was standing in Beetle 's outer office with a number of high-ranking officers when Ken Strong brought Admiral Friedeburg down the corridor . As the admiral came face to face with the group , he stopped . He did n't salute , but he came to attention and passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lasted about twenty minutes , and when it broke up , we learned that Friedeburg was n't authorized to surrender . He could parley , but could not enter commitments . The two Germans were authorized to communicate with Doenitz , but , unfortunately , they had not brought a code nor arranged for frequencies for radio communication between Reims and Flensburg , the temporary capital of Germany . Beetle had given them the terms of the Supreme Commander , which called for unconditional surrender . All German forces , aircraft and surface ships were to remain at their present positions , and not allowed to scatter . The German War Department , the OKW , must guarantee to enforce and execute all orders issued by SHAEF . Furthermore , the surrender terms had to apply to the Russians . Friedeburg emphasized the inability of the German High Command to send messages to its outlying forces . Communications were tarn by our bombings and many German units were in flight . He indicated that at least 48 hours would be needed before he could sign , and spoke feelingly of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Germans still are our enemies , and would remain so until the surrender . But after they capitulate , they would be treated in accordance with the normal dictates of humanity . The Admiral took the terms back to the office that was assigned to him and called for whisky . ( Continued an Page 117 ) ( Cunrinllcd from Pace 85 ) While Beetle was delivering the terms to Friedeburg , the brass that had assembled in Beetle 's outer office had moved to the War Room and was joined by Susloparoff . The movie cameras were in focus , the lights lit and all was in readiness in case the Germans were ready . Beetle walked in , blinded by the glare , and told the story to the assembled officials . There was nothing now to do but wait until Friedeburg heard from Doenitz . Friedeburg got off his message to Doenitz . It had to be sent in SHAEF code to the 2nd British Army Headquarters , the nearest to Flensburg . The 2nd Army was to decipher the message and send it by courier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ike up to date on events and , as there was nothing further to do at the moment , General Ike , escorted by the faithful Telek , left the building . I stayed behind to catch up on some of the notes of the day and to deal with the seemingly innumerable inquiries . I told Ike , as he went out , that if he had occasion to go to the War Room , he would find it looked more like a Hollywood stage setting . He did n't give a damn , so long as he got the formal and complete surrender . During the day , surrender of three more German armies to General Devers ' 6th Army Group had been announced . At dinner , Ike said the reason the Germans were stalling for time was to let Germans escape from Czechoslovakia , where they are being overrun by the Russians . It seems German high officials had sent their wives and children to Czechoslovakia to avoid our heavy bombings of German cities . Now that area , once regarded safe , is one in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Germans to get the western Allies to accept a surrender and thus create a schism with the Russians . Once the Supreme Commander has the proper German representatives with suitable authority to act , he does not propose to let them dilly-dally . Furthermore , he wants the German Army to know this time that it has been completely and decisively beaten in the field , so there will not be the cry that was heard after World War I that it was the German home front that caved in , and not the Army . General Ike wants to seal the Allied victory so completely that no one in Germany , civilian , soldier , airman or sailor , will fail to appreciate the fact that the " super-race " has had the hell beaten out of it . I asked Ike if he did n't think the French might well have a representative present for the signing , this being their country and we are having the Russians present . He agreed , and said that the omission was a complete oversight , and sent word to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be on hand . General Smith , as Chief of Staff of Supreme Headquarters , would , of course , sign representing both Britain and the United States . SHAEF Forward WeImed , Sandal ' , Mn , 6 , 1e45 . Admiral Friedeburg and Colonel Poleck had spent the night under guard in the small villa for officers visiting SHAEF . It is a seven-room house at 3 Rue Godenot . The Germans dined at 11:00 last night on tomato juice , pork chops , mashed potatoes , carrots and peas , fruit , coffee and red wine . Admiral Friedeburg had commented on the fine linen and remarked that the owner of the house must be " rich . " The Germans listened to the radio in their sitting room until after midnight and then retired . Shortly before noon , while I was working on my notes , the PRD men poked their faces in the door . They said in a whisper that the Chief of Staff had come to the office where they were working and said , " Who represents the PRD here ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they did . " Then whoever 's responsible for all that Hollywood equipment in the War Room must get it out immediately . This is n't going to be a show . There 's going to be a surrender . Get it out immediately . " During the lunch at the house , I told Ike of my dilemma and he said that all he knew about it was that Beetle had come to his office during the forenoon and said that the War Room had been made into a Hollywood stage and that he did n't like it . Ike had merely said it was Beetle 's show and he could do as he liked . General Ike was pretty well whipped down from the tension of waiting and interruptions to his sleep caused by the Prime Minister and others telephoning him , so be decided to take a nap . I went back to the office to work out my problem . * * * * * * * * * * FOGGY NIGHT pa Elizabeth-Ellen Lona The whole night long Foghorns bellow and call Like frightened cattle Searching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bleating of an unseen buoy Answers them from a thicket Of tangled waves and wet gray skies . * * * * * * * * * * When I reached there , I found that Friedeburg had received a reply from Doenitz that the Chief of Staff of the German Army , Col.

Wilhelm Oxenius , and the two were in the custody of Major General de Guingand , Monty 's Chief of Staff . They are flying in the latter 's C-47 , called " Mary Lou . " To me , this meant the end of our long vigil soon would be reached . I went to Beetle 's office to clear the matter of the War Room vs . Hollywood setting , and found that he , too , was taking a nap and would not be at the office until 5:00 o'clock , in time to deal with Jodi . I phoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , despite Beetle 's flare-up , I thought we cotild handle a pool of from 15 to 20 correspondents who would be representative of world coverage . They should be flown up immediately . When the Chief of Staff arrived about 5:00 , I went in and talked it out . The rest had improved his disposition ; he was gracious , understanding and cooperative . I told him it was the responsibility of the PRD to arrange for the world to know of the historic proceedings , and that it was not just his show . He agreed , but did n't like the idea of so many microphones on the table . I compromised this immedi ately , as I knew " Brownie " could get a reasonably good pickup with one microphone for radio and movies . Beetle agreed . I heaved a sigh of relief , told him of the sweat I had been in , and he said , " Your sweat ? What do you think the rest of us are doing ? " Beetle did n't even seem to mind when I told him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a room just below his office . About this time there was much scurrying around the corridors . Jodl and his aide were arriving . He arrogantly strode in from the car into the headquarters building , expressionless . An MP saluted and the German Chief of Staff returned the salute and , like Friedeburg , did not give the Nazi gesture . He was taken to the same office previously used by Friedeburg , where the latter , with Colonel Poleck , was sitting . Fawley , who practically had his ear to the keyhole , reported that when the Admiral opened the door to admit Jodl , there was no salute , but Jodl exclaimed , " Ah-ha . " The door closed , but soon the Admiral came out , asked for coffee and a map of Europe . Jodl could be seen marching up and down . Shortly after 6:00 , Jodl and Friedeburg were taken by Ken Strong into Beetle 's office , where again Strong was the interpreter . They stayed in nearly an hour and a half , when Beetle and Ken left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he left , Beetle told his secretary to send for Susloparoff . General de Gaulle had sent General Sevez . Beetle and Ken were with General Ike about 20 minutes when Strong reappeared , but at the time I reached General Ike 's office , Beetle and Strong had gone into a huddle with Susloparoff , who , so far , had not been in contact with the Germans at all . Ken Strong had told me there would be at least three hours ' delay while Jodl , who brought a code , could make a signal to Doenitz . Strong was just going in to talk further with the Germans as I went into General Ike 's office to see if he was n't tired enough to go home . We were invited to a reception at the Wac House , and General Ike was not inclined to attend until I told him Susloparoff and Sevez had been invited and had accepted . He thought he would stop for a few minutes and then go home to dinner . Just then the phone rang . It was Ken Strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Without hesitation , Ike said , " You tell them that forty-eight hours from midnight tonight I will close my lines on the Western Front so no more Germans can get through . Whether they sign or not ; no matter how much time they take . " The Germans , of course , were frightened of the Russians and were seeking to surrender to French , American and British forces . General Ike went on to make clear that the forty-eight hours would start running at midnight . MIME , Forward Illelnasl , Monday , May 7 , 1915 . About 1:30 this morn ing I was called to the phone . It was Beetle 's secretary . She said , " The big party is on , " that General Ike already had arrived . I hurried around to the War Room , where I found the Russian officers , and General Spaatz , General Morgan , Admiral Burrough , Air Marshal Robb , General Sevez already gathered and waiting . General Bull followed me in . Beetle arrived , looked over the seating arrangements , spoke briefly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one lonely microphone upon which the whole world was dependent . He blinked in the floodlights , but I felt that now , with the proper pool of 17 correspondents assembled quietly but attentively in the rear , he would not call off the proceedings . General Jodl , Admiral Fricdeburg , the two principals , arrived , escorted by General Strong and Brigadier Foord . General Strong placed the documents for signature in front of General Smith . Beetle spoke briefly to the Germans , which was interpreted for them by Strong . It was merely that the surrender documents awaited signature . Were they ready and prepared to sign ? Jodl indicated assent with a slight nod . Jodi had two documents to sign . Generals Smith , Susloparoff and Sevez then signed both documents . At the conclusion of the signing , General Jodl stood to attention , addressed General Smith and said , in English , " I want to say a word . " Then he lapsed into German , later interpreted as : " General ! With this signature , the German people and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delivered into the victor 's hands . In this war , which has lasted more than five years , both have achieved and suffered more than perhaps any other people in the world . In this hour I can only express the hope that the victor will treat them with generosity . " The official time of the signature on the surrender document was 2:41 A.M. British Double Summer Time . The delegates arose , and the Germans were taken to the room assigned them , and the remainder went to General Ike 's office . This shift of the scene had been anticipated by the cameramen , who knew they would have to race from the War Room by a circuitous route to reach the Supreme Commander 's office in time to get pictures . I went with them and , breathless , they got set just in time to record in the dim light the presentation of the Germans to the Supreme Commander and his deputy , Air Chief Marshal Tedder . General Ike sternly asked the Germane if they fully understood the terms and whether they were prepared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ? The answer was made in the affirmative ; the Germane bowed etiffly and left the room . But Ike 's work was n't finished . He still had to make a short newsreel and radio recording . Taking the Air Chief Marshal with him to the War Room , so both Allies would be shown together , General Ike spoke briefly " from the cuff . " He had to make one retake after I butted in . He had used the word " armistice , " and I was apprehensive that this term , which to me connotated all the laxity and unpreparedness of the period between the two wars , was a bad one to Uf3e . Growling and scowling at me , he substituted " surrender . " As we walked back to General Ike 's office , Tedder poked me in the ribs and said , with a twinkle in his eyes , that General Ike could make the best speech in the world and I should mind my own damned business . Anyway , it was n't an armistice , it was a complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been fighting for . From time to time , we had joked as to the kind of heroic language that the Supreme Commander might use to tell the Combined Chiefs that the surrender had been achieved : " We have met the enemy and they are ours " or " Do n't give up the ship ; we 've just begun to fight . " But the Supreme Commander dictated a cable to the Combined Chiefs simply : The mission of this Allied Force was fulfilled at 0241 local time , May 7 , 1945. "
