txt Twenty-two members of the United Electrical Workers , charged with assault with deadly weapons in a strike riot at the Elkay Manufacturing company plant in Cicero last April 5 , may know their fate tonight . Judge Leonard C. Reid of Criminal court , hearing the trial without a jury , is expected to get the case after arguments this afternoon . The trial , which ended its sixth week yesterday , was shortened when Judge Reid got an agreement by which 36 remaining character witnesses for the defense appeared on the stand only long enough to identify themselves . It was stipulated that their testimony if given would have vouched for the defendants ' peaceful reputation . Assistant State 's Attorneys Edmund Grant and John Schaffenegger called Police Sgt. Ben Babka and Policeman George Caspar of Cicero as rebuttal witnesses . Babka testified that the strikers , members of ** local 1119 , were the aggressors in the rioting . Casper asgerted the plant 's gates were open to anyone who wanted to enter , contradicting the strikers ' contention that they were locked out .
