Amid strange surroundings , the Duke of Windsor , who is also the Governor of the Bahamas , called on 214 of his constituents last week . The place : a Farm Security Administration camp near Swedesboro , N.J. The constituents : some of the 2,000 Bahamian Negroes brought to the U.S. to help relieve the farm manpower shortage . <P> The visit was an eloquent demonstration of a fact which the War Manpower Commission is just now learning the hard way : men &; women do not respond according to the slide rule . The Duke saw pleasant surroundings : red frame houses , a neat canvas mess tent , a medical clinic , shower baths , even a jukebox . ( " What 's that ? " demanded Windsor , " a stove ? " ) <P> He found that his constituents were well pleased with their pay : a guaranteed minimum of $3 a day ( plus board , lodging and work clothes ) for ten hours ' work . One of them turned out to be a former gardener at the Governor 's Palace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in life . Said the Duke : " Andrew , I want to congratulate you on getting better wages . " Replied Andrew , grinning : " Thank you , m'lord . " <P> But the Bahamians were not so pleased , as might have been expected . The Duke asked them about the weather ; they shook their heads . The New Jersey spring was too chilly . . . most of them had caught colds . . . the climate did not compare with that of the Bahamas . Then what about the food ? The Bahamians shook their heads again , sadly . The Duke explained to the camp manager : " You see , they 're used to eating peas and rice covered with pork fat . It 's a horrible mess , really , but they like it . . . . " <P> One boy was afraid he might be sent to an unknown land , Maryland , and he did not want to go . Embarrassed , the Duke explained that he could do nothing about it , added : " You have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He noted that the camp manager had provided mackinaws and extra blankets against the weather , was experimenting with the camp diet . He went away well pleased with the way the U.S. Government was taking care of his people . But his people were not so sure . <P> Next day , in Manhattan , the Duke and his Duchess saw another phase of the U.S. manpower problem . At the new Women 's Military Services Club they were guests of honor at the first Saturday tea dance , attended by 850 WAACs , WAVES , Army nurses , and servicemen . <P> In the receiving line , an Army nurse became flustered , told him she was wearing a Navy nurse 's uniform , had to be corrected by her companion . A WAVE ensign , Mary Elizabeth Birch , 23 , asked him to dance . An unidentified WAAC tried to cut in , was shooed away by Secret Service men . In the midst of the party the Duke disappeared , was found in a corner talking to a group of he-soldiers.      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
