Granite-willed , softhearted , old ( 80 ) " Uncle Dan " Willard last week made good a ten-year threat . He resigned as $60,000-a-year President of B. &; O. , stepped up to a less active chairmanship , turned over the throttle to Western Union 's Roy Barton White . Oldest R.R. president in the U.S. , he had headed B. &; 0 . for 31 years , was the last link between the days of Harriman-Hill-Gould and the regulation-cramped ICC . But spry Uncle Dan hated to knock off . Said he : " I wish I were only 60 and could keep on . I love it . " <P> He got his love for railroads watching the Central Vermont 's famous engine , General Taylor , cross his father 's pastures in North Hartland , Vt . One day in April 1879 , he decided to find out where it went , got a job as a $1-a-day section hand , worked up as fireman , locomotive engineer , machinist , trainmaster and superintendent . At 43 he became vice president of James J. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call to put B. &; O. in order , Hill fought to hold him , vainly offered to merge the Burlington and Great Northern , make Uncle Dan president of the whole works . <P> At B. &; 0 . Uncle Dan became famous the country over as labor 's best friend in management . An old brotherhood member himself in his engineer days , he believed in the unions , tried to work with them , helped settle the 1922 shopworkers ' strike . He tried to make his workers feel the railroad was theirs too , keynoted his advertisements : " 70,000 of us invite you to ride our railroad . " So in the dark winter of 1931-32 labor listened when he told them the carriers could not make the grade unless labor took a 10% wage cut . <P> Despite his age , Dan Willard never slipped behind the times . The only sign in his office reads : " Suggestions are always in order . " Over 40,000 suggestions have come from the rank &; file-many of which Uncle Dan adopted . He helped pioneer air-conditioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roads . Though he holds twelve honorary degrees and has a place on the Johns Hopkins Board , he prizes most the degree his employes gave him at a big dinner in 1931 : Doctor of Humanity in the University of Life and Labor . <P> In recent years Uncle Dan has had his troubles . With a funded debt of $670,133,000 in 1938 , B. &; O. had to pay out $32,184,000 in fixed charges . That year the line lost $13,124,530 and it looked as if the courts came next . But Uncle Dan made the fur fly , got $8,233,000 from his old friend Jesse Jones , sold a ditch of a canal to PWA for $2,000,000 , persuaded Congress to pass the Chandler Act , so astutely worded that it helped no other trunk line , but let B. &; 0 . cut its fixed charges to $19,349,000 in 1939 . <P> Today President White ( who worked for B. &; O. 25 years , and Central of New Jersey seven years , before going to Western Union ) takes over with the tracks almost clear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . During the first quarter of this year B. &; O. had a net operating income ( before fixed charges , taxes , etc. ) of $10,316,672-up 112% over 1940 . But Roy White , like Uncle Dan , likes railroading in general , B. &; O. in particular , no matter what the signals read . In his new job he takes a $25,000-a-year cut in salary ( from $85,000 ) , but to be back in railroading he figures it is worth it .
