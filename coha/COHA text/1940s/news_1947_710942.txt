txt Stag Cnrrespandent The Christian Science Mon , for Rome Full weight of a general strike now threatens to fall on Italy 's Capital . No progress has been made toward settlement of the half political and half economic demands made by provincial labor leaders , and the strike is to begin at midnight .

Last month it was Communist Umberto Terracini who claimed he was misquoted by the press . Now it is Mauro Scoccimarro who says he is aggrieved . Widely quoted as having told a Communist gathering in Turin that in 1948 the Communists might well be forced to take up arms to attain their ends , Signor Scoccimarro , who is one of Italy 's top Marxists , now says he was misquoted.
