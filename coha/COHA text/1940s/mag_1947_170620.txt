As the Moscow Conference on Germany and Austria convened , Russian Foreign Minister Molotov remarked that the situation in China had not improved since the Foreign Ministers discussed it in 1945 . ( The interval had seen a full-scale civil war between Molotov 's fellow Communists in China and the Chinese Government . ) Molotov asked that the U.S. , Britain and Russia exchange information on China . Secretary Marshall agreed , asked for time to consider the procedure for discussion . <P> If he wanted to take it , Marshall had in the Russian proposal a wide-open opportunity to turn the conference into a discussion of the current world crisis as a whole . China , Korea , the Middle East , Turkey , Greece , Eastern Europe and Germany were all parts of a single question . That question was : How great was the postwar expansion of Russian influence going to be ? <P> The Russians had in the past preferred a piecemeal approach . U.S. policy could be more clearly crystallized and more effectively stated in a unified approach .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
