( PETEY does so ) SARA ( To SAM ) What 's the matter ? SAM This is awful . SARA Why ? SAM I ca n't see you . I feel like a dummy . p. 14 BOROS ( In sing-song ) Stop talking , please . SARA ( To SAM , in a loud whisper ) He means you . BOROS ( To PETEY ) Higher a little . SARA ( To SAM ) How do you do , Mr. Fenn ? I 'm Mrs. Boulting out here . SAM Yes , I know . SARA I 've wanted to meet you . SAM Me , too . You . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SARA ( To SAM ) I had an idea you were something special when Reuben did n't bring you home straight off .

So when he kept you down there to himself , Mr. Fenn , I gathered he was loath to share you You do look nice You do n't look as brilliant as he claims you to be , but then , he knows about such things and I do n't . BOROS ( To SAM ) Thank you , sir . No more . ( SAM steps out , quickly ) Out , Petey . ( PETEY puts out the photo lights , one by one . SAM gets out of the robes , and steps toward SARA , blinking . He opens his eyes wide and finds himself standing very close to her . He stares ) p. 15 SARA ( Extending her hand ) Hello . SAM ( Taking it ) How do you do ? ( They look at each other in instant accord , in flowing empathy ) SARA ( After a moment ) Sit down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too . Across the room , BOROS sits on sofa looking at some prints . ANNA is at the library table , studying her notes . PETEY adjusts a socket ) SAM Thank you . SARA I 'm allowed to call you Sam. Protocol . But you must call me Ma'am or Mrs. Boulting or , should you be presenting me , Mrs. Justice Boulting. Never , on pain of social death , may you call me by my other name . SAM Which is ? SARA ( Whispering ) Sara . SAM Best of all . SARA I agree . SAM Too bad I can never say it . SARA One of the little tragedies of our stiff and proper rule-book life here in Washington . ( A short pause ) p. 16 SAM You do n't like it much . SARA I 'm learning to like it . After two years , I 'm beginning to find it quite comfortable and relaxing , really . We are all told where to go , and when ; where to sit , and for how long . No need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ custom and tradition . SAM The Army was like that . SARA Well , then , you know . SAM Yes . SARA Every Monday afternoon , for example  --  rain or shine  --  ( JUSTICE BOULTING strides into the room ) BOULTING ( As he comes in ) All right , now . ( Everyone in the room with the exception of SARA , rises and stands in place . REUBEN BOULTING is a stolid , handsome man who wears his distinction becomingly . He is that rare person whose hopes have been fulfilled . His first ambition , his very first , was to be a judge . His earliest boyhood game was a mock court , set up in the basement , Judge Reubie Boulting presiding . From that basement , the distance to his present seat on the Supreme Court bench is considerable . The journey has tired him much . Thus , we find him now calm , but also dignified and self-satisfied . Complete contentment lies now but a few feet away  --  the Chief Justice 's chair at the center of the bench , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man ) Hello , Fenn . Brought the revision ? p. 17 SAM Yes , sir . Right here . ( He gets his briefcase ) BOULTING Checked it ? SAM Yes , sir . ( He takes out a sheaf of papers and hands them to BOULTING , who scans them ) BOULTING What did you think ? SAM The cat 's whiskers . BOULTING ( Laughing ) Cat 's whiskers , eh ? That 's very good , yes . ( He indicates SARA ) You 've met Mrs. Justice Boulting ? SAM Yes , sir . I have . BOULTING Well , then , that 's all right . ( He moves to the waiting BOROS ) Now , then , let us get on with this nonsense . BOROS I am honored to meet , sir . BOULTING Fine , fine . I do n't like this sort of thing at all . I should appreciate speed more than anything else . BOROS Very good , sir . Quick and painless . BOULTING Quick and painless , yes . Suits me fine . BOROS Petey , quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helps BOULTING into his robes . BOROS moves him into position and springs to the camera . ANNA assists with the plates , PETEY with the lights . SARA and SAM are watching ) Look here , please . So . Now , ready . Softly , please . Look softly . No , no ! Not to pose . Kindly , not to pose . Just to live . To relax . Now . So . Good . ( A pause , then the noise of the shutter is heard ) One ! ( Furious activity involving the change of plates , with some adjustment in the lighting ) Now , sir , if you please  --  . Anna ! ( He signals his wife , who steps in with a handkerchief and removes the moisture from BOULTING 'S brow . While this is being done , BOROS turns to SARA ) Mrs. Justice , may I impose on your help ? p. 18 SARA Of course . ( BOROS places her , carefully , beside the camera ) BOROS Now , sir , please to look into the eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiles broadly , artificially , since he feels this is what is expected of him ) No , no . Not to smile as for a photo . Just to look . ( BOULTING follows these instructions as best he can ) So . Better . Better . Just to look . Softly . With your love . More . More . Too much ! So . Good . ( The shutter again ) Two ! Once again only , please . ( To SAM , in sudden inspiration ) Young man , please . Here . Quick , quick ! ( SAM obeys . ANNA replaces the plate while BOROS pushes SAM into position , directly behind SARA . He moves him closer , then closer still , until the bodies of SARA and SAM are touching . Now he places SAM 'S head over SARA 'S shoulder and moves their heads together . Their cheeks are touching ) Now , sir , please . The look as before and add by looking at the young man the look of master to pupil . So . To the wife , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wisdom . ( BOULTING tries hard ) So . So . Let me have it . Give me . Give me . So . See them the both . So . Smiling  --  softly  --  in wisdom . So . If you please . Yes . Yes ! ! ( The click of the shutter ) Yes ! ! ! Thank you . Ha , ha ! I thank you all . Done ! p. 19 SARA ( Going to BOULTING ) You did that wonderfully well , darling . ( BOROS is greatly pleased with his performance . BOULTING moves out of position , removing his robes . PETEY turns out the photo lights . BOROS claps his hands . ANNA brings him a handkerchief and a glass of water . He uses both . He claps his hands again and signals PETEY and ANNA . They begin to dismantle the camera and the lights ) BOROS ( To BOULTING ) Quick and good , no ? BOULTING Thank you . BOROS I am happy . ( SAM hands BOULTING the papers ) BOULTING Good . I 'll take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you like this young bucko ? SARA ( Looking at SAM ) I have n't decided . BOULTING ( To SAM ) You 'll become accustomed to that sort of remark , Fenn . A product of what is called , I believe , a sharp sense of humor . She 's always had it . Always had it . SARA Always . BOULTING ( Happily ) I get the best clerk every year . A secret method of selection which I shall carry to the grave . You should see Willis 's new clerk . He lisps . Willis is in a fury . In a fury . ( He chortles with glee ) Now , you two get acquainted , you two . I 'll have a look at this . Fenn says it 's the cat 's whiskers , Sara . Did you hear him ? p. 20 SARA Yes . ( BOULTING starts out ) BOROS ( Calling after him ) Goodbye , sir . Thank you . BOULTING ( Without looking back ) Goodbye . BOROS An honor . ( BOULTING is gone . PETEY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to SARA ) I hope we did not bother and annoy , madam ? SARA Not at all . BOROS Shall we replace the room in order ? SARA No , no . We 'll do it . BOROS Thank you . SARA You 've been very kind . BOROS Goodbye , today . Mrs. Justice . ( He bows to kiss her hand . ANNA and PETEY come back for the last of the load ) Young man . ( SAM nods ) ANNA Goodbye , Mrs. Boulting . SARA Goodbye . BOROS ( As he straightens his bow , he speaks to ANNA and PETEY ) Quick ! Quick ! Quick ! ( They scurry off , followed by BOROS . SARA begins to put the room in order . SAM helps in whatever way he can , throughout the following . There are chairs to be moved , and tables . Ornaments to be replaced , and lamps . Rugs to be rearranged . And , as they work , they find each other ) p. 21 SARA ( Indicating an end table ) I wonder if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , sure . SARA Will you stay to tea ? SAM Thank you . I was hoping you 'd ask me . Yes . SARA Good . It 's time we knew one another . I 'm eager . Reuben insists that you 're truly remarkable . SAM Insists ? SARA Says . SAM Well , you 'll soon find out , I 'm afraid . SARA ( Pointing the place ) Right there . You 'll be asked here a good deal , Sam , but you need n't come if it 's inconvenient or if you 've something better to do . SAM Thank you . SARA You 'll probably develop an interesting Washington life of your own . ( Touching the sofa ) This goes around . You must n't let us interfere with it too much . SAM I wo n't . ( Lifting ) This way ? SARA Yes . I 'm sure you have  --  friends of your own , and responsibilities . Personal ones . p. 22 SAM Mrs. Boulting , if you 're asking me have I got a girl , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I did want to know . ( SARA starts to move a chair ) SAM I 've got it . SARA It affects the seating arrangements . SAM Just now I 'm madly in love with the Supreme Court of the United States of America . SARA I hope you 'll be very happy . SAM If I get a girl , should I tell you right away ? SARA Please . SAM Can I bring her to tea ? SARA If she 's proper . SAM If she 's not  --  I 'll keep her a secret . SARA Fine . SAM Up to now , it does n't seem as though I 'm going to have much time to hunt . There 's an awful lot to do down there . Justice Boulting is what you might call  --  thorough . He does n't leave a tort unturned . SARA You like it ? SAM The work ? SARA Yes . p. 23 SAM ( From the heart ) I do . SARA Are you good at it ? SAM Well , if I can get over feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( She moves to an ottoman . SAM follows to help ) Over there . SAM I do n't know . Mine 's about Justice Boulting , and pretty deeply rooted . SARA Why awe ? SAM Because I ca n't think of him as a man  --  more a symbol . The whole idea of law came alive for me through him . That 's why . SARA How ? SAM Well , it was never my idea of anything to do . But you know how it is  --  the family . My brother had to be a doctor and I had to  --  . That 's how they had it figured out and  --  well , line of least resistance . Then , one night  --  up at school  --  I was dulling along , digging some stuff for a brief  --  and I came across my first Boulting decision  --  an old one , but new to me . I must have read it ten times . I copied it  --  the whole thing . It made the difference . From that night on  --  law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff all the time  --  I do n't always follow his  --  but that 's my fault , because I 'm sure that he  --  ( A pause ) p. 24 SARA Yes ? SAM No . SARA Does the Justice know all this ? SAM No , Ma'am , I do n't think so . In fact , I 'm sure not . SARA Do you mind if I tell it to him ? SAM Yes , I think I would . SARA But why ? SAM My guess is he would n't like it much . Too sentimental . SARA You may be right . He 's not a sentimental man . SAM No . SARA He used to be . And he may be again one day . SAM Did you say  --  ? SARA Yes . I think that only the very young and the very old appreciate sentimentality . SAM ( Smiling ) And which are you , ma'am ? SARA Very young . SAM Very old , me . ( They smile together ) SARA I think you 'll get along better , Sam , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're not so much , as you say , in awe . So , I 'm going to tell you something about Mr. Justice Reuben Boulting . Can you keep a secret ? p. 25 SAM ( Honestly ) Not very well , no . SARA Can you try ? SAM Oh , sure . SARA Well , then  --  try . SAM All right . SARA This figure who awes you so was once  --  well , my uncle Alan , my guardian , always referred to him as " that disgusting young anarchist . " SAM Was he ? SARA An anarchist ? I do n't think so . I do n't think my uncle thought so , for that matter . He was only trying to frighten me . And he succeeded . I certainly was frightened of that wild young Reuben Boulting . He was the terror of Youngstown , Ohio . A real noisemaker . Have you ever heard about his suffrage stunt ? SAM His what ? SARA It was when he was running for mayor . Reuben was one of the rare men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election day he rounded up fifty or sixty of his cronies and  --  we all met in one of his father 's warehouses  --  helped dress them up in women 's clothes  --  then they all marched downtown to cast their ballots . Carrying signs : " IF SHE KNEW ENOUGH TO BE YOUR MOTHER  --  SHE KNOWS ENOUGH TO VOTE ! " It was a sensation ! They were arrested , of course  --  disorderly conduct  --  and fined . Reuben 's point was that dramatizing an injustice was an old American custom  --  old as the Boston Tea Party  --  but it cost him the election . So he called a great town meeting in the square . I 'll never forget that night , Reuben shouting above the catcalls and telling them they did n't deserve a civilized man to serve them . It caused a riot ! So you see , he was n't always this figure of dignity . p. 26 SAM I 'm more in awe than ever now , though . ( SARA laughs ) SARA Let me try again . He used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We might never have married if it had n't been for that banjo . ( A pause ) He proposed to me every day for a year . In person , in poems , in songs , and over the electric telephone . Then he stopped . I was bereft , but my uncle was so pleased to have the parlor rid of him . There was a great birthday ball given for me  --  on my twenty-first . Reuben was asked , but he would n't come . Then , right in the midst of it  --  we heard someone singing on the front lawn . When we looked to see  --  it was Reuben , of course . He stood there in a ridiculous purple cloak , in a cap with a plume , playing his banjo and singing , Come live with me , Sara , and be my love ! SAM And it worked ? SARA As you see . ( She goes to another chair ) SAM This one too ? SARA Yes , please . ( They move it into place . The room is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sam . I 'm sure that furniture moving is n't in your contract , and it was good of you to help . Do sit down now . ( SAM watches her ) p. 27 SAM ( Reaching into his pocket ) May I smoke ? SARA If it 's all right with your mother , it 's all right with me . ( SAM laughs and gets a cigarette ) I 'm a little annoyed by your question . No , not a little . A lot . SAM What question ? SARA " May I smoke ? " And I wonder why . Can it be that , with it , you date me a little ? SAM Why , no . SARA Does n't " May I smoke ? " go with gas-light and mutton-chop whiskers ? SAM Not necessarily . SARA If you were calling on your girl , on your non-existent girl , would you ask ? SAM Of course . I 'm very polite . SARA Really ? It does n't go with brilliance , as a rule . Reuben was a brilliant young man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . SARA He was far too concerned with telling the truth , which , as you know , is seldom compatible with politeness . Have n't you found that so ? SAM I do n't know . SARA He came to take me out once , kissed me , smiled lovingly , and said , " Darling , that is the ugliest hat I have ever seen on the head of a human . " p. 28 SAM Was it ? SARA I did n't think so at the time He said even worse things about my brain , but I did n't mind those as much as his opinions about my hats He changed both , in time What a gay , noisy time we had ! What causes , and committees , and street corner meetings and suffrage parades ! I was easily enlisted in the little army of progress  --  I found it so enjoyable . He had a more difficult time changing my hats . ( STEWART enters from dining-room to straighten out room . SARA looks up ) SARA All arranged , Stewart , thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes the small tray and goes out ) SAM They 're still going on , you know . SARA What are ? SAM The " causes and committees . " SARA Yes , I know . Why ? SAM Nothing . You just made them sound so in the past . SARA Did I ? SAM Yes . SARA We ca n't join up as much these days , Sam . We 're a Supreme Court Justice . p. 29 SAM Of course . SARA You think I 'm an old has-been . SAM Not at all . SARA You said so . SAM No . SARA You 're not as polite as you claim to be . SAM Of course not . ( A pause ) SARA Do n't be so disapproving . SAM I did n't mean  --  SARA Reuben once said about progress that it was a great relay of civilization  --  each generation passing the torch to the next , to be carried another lap . SAM I do n't agree . SARA You do n't ? SAM Certainly not . SARA ( In mock discovery ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( They laugh ) SAM No , that relay idea is just a graphic fake . It sounds pretty , but it is n't true . Look at Justice Holmes , eighty-two , and has he passed on the torch ? Of course not . It is n't a relay we live  --  it 's a  --  it 's growth . And when we stop growing , we die . p. 30 SARA Trees do n't . SAM Do n't what ? SARA Die when they stop growing . SAM Well , we 're not trees . SARA Really ? SAM Do n't you agree ? Please do . I love to have people agree with me . SARA I 'll bet you do . But do n't you find it more satisfying when they begin by opposing you and you are able to bring them around to your side by eloquence and hypnotism ? SAM Yes . I wonder why . SARA Conquest . SAM Oh . SARA I always let men convince me of things . Slowly . Usually after a hard struggle . I am extremely popular and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( A long pause , during which SAM does not take his eyes from her face . Finally ) I 've forgotten what we were talking about . SARA Progress . SAM Oh , that old thing ! SARA Yes . SAM Well  --  growth . When I say growth , I mean that no one can  --  ( EVELYN comes in with the tea table ) p. 31 SARA Thank you , Evelyn . Will you knock on the study door and say " Tea " ? Softly . Both the knock and the word . ( SARA and EVELYN smile at each other . A private joke ) EVELYN Yes , ma'am . I know now . ( She goes out . SARA begins to pour ) SARA How do you take your tea , Sam ? Just tell me this first time and I 'll remember . SAM Why  --  uh  --  ( SARA , poised , waits his instruction ) Just  --  I think this time  --  . Look , Mrs. Boulting , I 'm going to tell you the truth . I 've never had tea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ma'am . I 've had all sorts of things to drink . Coffee , milk , cocoa , cider , orange juice , cocoanut milk , wine , whiskey , Bevo  --  I 've even had strawberry juice . But no tea . SARA How do you explain it ? SAM I do n't explain it . Tea is just a thing that has never  --  flowed into my life , that 's all . Now that it has , all right . I like new experiences  --  so I 'll have it , gladly , but please do n't ask me how , because I have n't the slightest idea . SARA Try milk and no sugar . p. 32 SAM Glad to . SARA I suppose you 'd prefer whiskey ? SAM I certainly would  --  but I 'm glad it 's not . SARA Why ? SAM Well  --  it 's just that I 'm enjoying myself tremendously and I would n't want to get any drunker than I am right now . SARA Drunker ? SAM Not on liquor . SARA Oh . ( SARA hands SAM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SAM Thank you . ( SARA pours tea for herself . SAM is sipping his ) SARA How do you like it ? SAM Well , I get the idea . SARA Good . SAM Mrs. Boulting  --  ( He stops ) SARA Yes ? SAM No . Nothing . ( A short pause ) I was just going to say  --  but I 'm not sure how to put it  --  that I feel as though I 've known you for a long time . SARA Perhaps you have . I 'm sure I 've known you for as long as I can remember . p. 33 SAM How ? SARA I recognized you almost instantly . SAM I guess if you 've seen one green clerk  --  you 've seen them all . SARA I did n't mean that . SAM Oh . Well , anyway , ma'am , I can tell you that this is the  --  top of my life . Justice Boulting , and you , and  --  SARA And  --  ? SAM And so on . The future . SARA You 're hopeful about your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SAM Why ? SARA Most young people I meet are so cynical . SAM It 's a pose . I do it , too , sometimes . SARA I see SAM Anyway , it has n't anything to do with age . To be cynical  --  SARA I 'm sure you 're right . SAM ( Disappointed ) Oh , are you ? SARA What 's the matter ? SAM Are n't you going to give me a chance to win you over ? p. 34 SARA ( Laughing ) It 's done , Sam . SAM To be cynical you 've got to be either tired or ignorant . I wanted to get that out , anyway , since I had it ready . ( A pause ) SARA Sam , are you certain that law is your field ? SAM I guess so . SARA It 's a routine question , really . I ask it of every new clerk . SAM Why ? SARA Oh , I like to hear the different answers . SAM Well , I 'm not sure it 's my field , no . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get to where I want to go . SARA Where ? SAM I was hoping you would n't ask me that because I do n't know the honest answer . Yet . See , I 'm ambitious  --  but I do n't know for what . I 'm not sure of things . I say I think this and that  --  but deep down  --  I do n't know  --  I do n't know what I think . Except that this is n't the best of all possible worlds . SARA I suppose not . SAM Three thousand years of civilization  --  more , is n't it ?  --  and look at us . Is this the best that can be accomplished ? Is this as far as we can go ? In law  --  and this is what I like about it  --  we have the highest conception of our ability to bring about order . All right . So we 've got precedent and practice  --  and we fix up rules , right ? , to regulate human behavior . ( He plunges ahead without waiting for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on him . She is watching him , more than listening to him , word for word . Her ears hear only an old song  --  a lovely , old , exciting song ) Of course , up to now we have n't done as well as the ants have  --  or the bees  --  but we 're coming along slowly . Now , here are some things I 'd like to find out . Is there enough to go ' round ? Or not ? Why are people ungovernable ? Or are they ? Is it true that laws are made to be broken ? And , if so , why make them ? Think of it this way  --  now the world has been made safe for democracy . All right . Good . Good and noble . And it seems a good time  --  the best time to examine  --  . Do you think I talk too much ? p. 35 SARA Yes . SAM So do I. I ca n't help it . Well , the best time to examine just what it is we have won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Splendid idea . Inspiring  --  but is it practical  --  possible ? Why does n't it work as it should ? Is the plan wrong ? Or is it us ? And which will have to change ? And how ? SARA That is the longest list of questions ever asked in this house . I congratulate you . SAM Thank you . SARA We 're more in the answer business here . SAM I know . That 's why I came . SARA I hope you wo n't be disappointed , Sam . SAM I wo n't be . I 'm not as goofy as I seem . I might have been before the Army  --  no more . I 'm not sure about the war now  --  whether it was just or not  --  whether we won it or lost it  --  but I know this . It was real . It was a real time . With a sound and feel and smell . Real . The talk about it  --  that 's talk . But the war was real . So all of us got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shelter and clothing , a job , and a chance to lie down in the sun once in a while . And only a few can get that . How come ? There must be a way  --  if we can only find it . It takes so little to make people happy  --  and listen , even if we do n't find it  --  is n't trying to worth something ? It 's about the only adventure that seems to have any sense to it  --  talk about Columbus  --  talk about the Crusades  --  Hell , they were after trinkets compared to what  --  ( Suddenly , SARA is in tears . SAM moves to her , in confusion . He half starts out of the room , then stops and turns back ) p. 36 SAM Is there anything  --  ? ( SARA shakes her head . She rises and moves to the back of the room in an effort to gain control . SAM , still at a loss , stands watching her , awkwardly . SARA blows her nose and takes a deep breath . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? SAM No , but was it something I  --  ? SARA No , no , Sam . Nothing you said  --  but everything you said . And more particularly  --  you . SAM I do n't think I  --  ( He stops ) SARA It 's just that you remind me of someone I once  --  . Nothing . A little trick of memory . SAM I 'm sorry . SARA Do n't be . I 'm glad . SAM Would you like me to change the subject ? SARA Please . SAM All right . ( There is a pause . He turns away , thinks hard for a moment  --  then ) When you first met Justice Boulting , was he interested in  --  ? ( SARA laughs ) What  --  ? ( SARA shakes her head ) Please tell me . I feel like a boob  --  you laughing and crying at I do n't know what . p. 37 SARA Of course , Sam . I understand , and I will tell you . Now , if I can . It 's a strange  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and carries a slim , beautifully bound book ) BOULTING Anything left for a laboring man ? ( He holds the book aloft ) I have a treat for you children , if you promise me you 've been good ! SARA ( Handing him a cup ) I hope this is hot enough , dear . BOULTING No matter . If it 's not , it 's my fault . I simply could not tear myself away from my own forceful brilliance . ( He laughs with something less than full conviction , then addresses SAM ) You must n't think we work as hard as this on every case , Fenn . Now and then one gets my particular dander up . I actually asked the C.J. to let me fire this one off . ( To SARA ) The Katzenjammer Kids are dissenting again . ( To SAM ) Holmes and Brandeis , you know . That 's what I call them . ( He sips his tea ) I 'm afraid old Holmes is in his third childhood , at the least . ( Another sip ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear all that boyish sentimentality and emotion pouring from his aged head . ( SAM looks surprised ) p. 38 SARA Look ! You 've shocked Sam . BOULTING Why ? SAM ( He smiles ) No  --  not shocked  --  but I guess I did think that all the Justices loved one another . BOULTING Be grateful that we do n't . You must see , Fenn , that pro and con are to thought what male and female are to the human race . There 'd be no propagation without two such  --  shall we say ?  --  sides . SARA Or without their becoming  --  shall we say ?  --  intimate . BOULTING ( To SAM ) I 've warned you , have n't I , Fenn , about that sharp sense of  --  SAM Yes , sir . You have . ( BOULTING finishes his tea , and sets down the cup ) BOULTING Now then , the treat ! ( To SAM ) In an article last year , for the Quarterly Review  --  ( To SARA ) You remember the  --  uh  --  ( To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was untranslatable . True , of course . And that  --  What sort of Greek scholar are you , Fenn ? SAM No prizes . BOULTING So ? You must work at it . Work at it always . The treasures of the past , you know . You must learn to enjoy your Greek . p. 39 SAM Oh , I enjoy it , sir , but without  --  well , passion , you might say . That only seems to fire when I consider the treasures of the future . BOULTING You 're young , Fenn . Yes . ( To SARA ) Do n't you think he 's young , Sara ? SARA Yes , I do . BOULTING How old are you ? SAM Twenty-nine , sir . Going on sixty . BOULTING ( To SARA , indicating SAM ) A young fogey ! Well , back to business . So this old scholar in Edinburgh read my piece and wrote me a letter in disagreement . Yes . Violent disagreement . Language a symbol for thought , you know , that was his line . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thought it translatable , why then the manner in which to prove his contention was to do so . To translate , you see . Well , here he 's done it  --  Sophocles , no less !  --  and so we shall see ! Impudent old duffer  --  he 's gone and dedicated the work to me . ( He laughs , obviously pleased and flattered ) Well , we shall see . You 'll read , Sara , wo n't you ? SARA Of course . ( BOULTING hands her the book ) BOULTING ( To SAM ) She reads beautifully . p. 40 SARA Well , we shall see . ( She rises to get her reading glasses . BOULTING moves to the sofa , which faces slightly away from SARA and SAM and toward the fireplace . He stretches his legs out before him ) BOULTING Now then ! We mount our hobby ! SARA " Sophocles . Tecmessa 's Fruitless Plea . " BOULTING Oh , this is thundering ! ( He intones the first few lines in Greek ) dmO despot ' A ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ o'ydn myixon ' anphswpois chachn .

For so the gods , And so thine arm , had willed it . Therefore now  --  For I am thine , thy wife and wish thee well  --  I charge thee by our couch which we have shared  --  ( BOULTING is breathing with slow , measured regularity . SAM notes this fact with a glance and then returns to watching the words form on SARA 'S lips ) Condemn me not , given over to their hands , To bear the cruel gibes thy foes shall fling.Bethink thee , on that day when thou shalt die , And by that death divorce me , violent handsOn me the Greeks will lay , and we shall liveHenceforth the life of slaves , thy child and I. ' ( BOULTING is asleep . SARA stops reading . In the silence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the book face down in her lap , and takes off her glasses . She looks at SAM . There is a pause . SAM points to himself , to the door , pantomimes the question , " Shall I go ? " SARA replies , wordlessly , " If you like . " He rises , gets his briefcase and the robes and comes back to SARA . She extends her hand . He takes it , holds it longer than he knows . SARA is looking up at him . He turns to look at BOULTING once again , and then he looks back at SARA . They stare at each other in the blinding light known only to them . Love and understanding pass between them . Then SAM leaves , quickly , without turning back . The sound of the front door closing awakens BOULTING . SARA is looking at the door . BOULTING stirs and clears his throat ) p. 41 BOULTING Go on , Sara . Go on . I 'm listening . ( SARA adjusts her glasses , picks up the book , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What home then shall I find instead of thee ? What wealth ? My life hangs utterly on thee , Nay even of me be mindful . Should not menRemember , having tasted of delight ? Even from kindness should new kindness spring , Who of past joy lets fade the memory , Call me not that man noble any more . " ( BOULTING is asleep again . SARA takes off her glasses , closes the book in her lap , and looks through the door again . There is a long , still pause ) @x ( BOULTING is startled , and complies instantly ) BOULTING Hello , Mother . ( He comes to her and kisses her cheek , perfunctorily ) I did n't see you . MRS . WIDMAYER ( Her attention on her work ) No reason to come wanderin ' in here like some bum . p. 43 BOULTING Sorry . MRS . WIDMAYER What a body does when they 're alone , by their-self , is what counts . Do n't care how they behave in the public eye . You 've heard me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mother , I have . MRS . WIDMAYER ( Sensing it ) Yes , and you may hear me say it again . I got some time left . Not as old as I look , you know . I just got wore out raisin ' Justices for the United States Supreme Court ! ( She just manages to get the last words out before her uproarious laugh breaks . BOULTING is glum . He moves to the desk and takes up a copy of the Washington Evening Star . He scans the front page , standing , then turns to the editorials . STEWART comes in , wearing informal chauffeur 's livery . He takes up the pile of books and briefcases and carries them out . We hear him call , Evelyn ! A moment later , EVELYN comes in ) EVELYN Good evening , sir . BOULTING ( Without looking up ) Good evening . ( She picks up his hat . BOULTING puts down his paper long enough to take off his overcoat and hand it to EVELYN ) EVELYN ( As she goes ) I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( EVELYN is gone . BOULTING sits in his chair and takes up the newspaper again . STEWART comes back in , buttoning on a white mess jacket . He goes to the serving table , opens the bottle of Vichy , and serves it ) STEWART ( As he works ) You sure picked a wrong night for your speech , sir . ( BOULTING , reading , does not reply ) Yes , sir . Having turtle soup , leg of lamb , mashed potatoes , boiled leeks and creme brulee here . Do n't expect they 'll have anything like that at the Shoreham . Chicken a la King , more'n likely . ( He brings BOULTING the Vichy on a small tray ) BOULTING ( Taking it ) Thank you . STEWART Would you like us to fix you a little snack , sir , in case it drags out ? BOULTING No . STEWART I believe Evelyn 's got your clothes laid out ready all right , but I 'll look to make sure . ( He goes out . BOULTING , still engrossed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it for a long moment , then drains it in one slow draught . He puts down the glass and returns to the paper . An extremely long pause ) MRS . WIDMAYER I always enjoy these quiet little chats with you , son . p. 45 BOULTING ( Looking up ) What ? ( She chuckles ) Oh . MRS . WIDMAYER It 's only seven , eight days a year and still there just do n't seem nothin ' to say to each other any more . Sad , ai n't it ? BOULTING I 'm sorry , Mother . I 'm just tired . MRS . WIDMAYER You ai n't just tired , you 're just rude . BOULTING ( A quick sigh ) All right . MRS . WIDMAYER I do n't care . Now . ( SARA comes in . She wears a long , becoming housecoat ) SARA Hello . BOULTING ( Engrossed in the polemics of the editorial page ) Good evening , Sara . SARA Had your Vichy ? BOULTING Yes , thank you . ( MRS . WIDMAYER takes off her glasses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's new , is n't it ? SARA Remodeled . MRS . WIDMAYER Well , it 's real striking . SARA Do you like it , Reuben ? p. 46 BOULTING ( Without looking up ) Lovely . ( The women look at each other and laugh ) MRS . WIDMAYER They 're all the same . SARA ( Quietly , after a little pause ) No , they 're not . MRS . WIDMAYER What ? Listen , I 've had two and a half husbands , so I ought to know . ( MRS . WIDMAYER watches her , oddly . BOULTING puts down his paper ) BOULTING I 'm going to read my speech , after all . SARA Really ? Why ? BOULTING Well , I discussed it with Taft and he agrees that the dramatic effect of extemporaneousness is nothing as compared to the value of the permanent record . SARA Well , he 'd know . BOULTING Yes . Fenn is seeing to the copies . I 'll leave one for you , if you like . SARA Yes , I would . MRS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speeches . Looks stupid . If you got somethin ' to say  --  why , get up in meetin ' and say it out . SARA Conference ? BOULTING ( To SARA ) I 'm very tired . p. 47 BOULTING The usual cock-fight . This time over the Brunio case . That Italian , you know ,  --  flooded the country with his homemade pamphlets . But worst of all , old Holmes was in one of his maddening , playful moods . And so , of course , he took to quoting and name-calling . I 'm not put off by labels , I said to him , finally . When I was a young crusader , the appellation " reactionary " seemed a gross insult , I said . In my present position , I said , I consider it , rather , an honor. ( He pauses , as though waiting for a round of applause ) He then made some foolish joke and that was the end of it . ( A pause ) MRS . WIDMAYER Well , what was the joke ? BOULTING What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was nothing . I do n't remember . MRS . WIDMAYER Yes , you do . BOULTING I assure you , Mother  --  MRS . WIDMAYER Do n't assure me . Just tell me . BOULTING ( Out of temper ) Oh , for God 's sake , Mother ! ( A silence ) MRS . WIDMAYER Never mind . I 'll ask Holmes when I see him . He 'll remember , I bet . p. 48 BOULTING Please do n't ! SARA I think he teases you because you mind it so . BOULTING Old bore . Does n't understand the function of his office . SARA He can be charming . BOULTING Not to me . MRS . WIDMAYER I like him because he 's so good-lookin ' ! ( She rises , puts down her work , and starts out ) SARA Are you all right , dear ? MRS . WIDMAYER ( Without stopping ) Certainly I 'm all right , but I ai n't goin ' to stay around no place where people are scared to tell the joke . ( She is gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really . BOULTING ( Sharply ) I do n't care if she is . SARA ( In reproach ) Reuben ! BOULTING I do n't . She 's been extremely trying this trip . ( He fills his glass again ) Good day ? SARA I took the longest walk . All the way out to Rock Creek Park and back . p. 49 BOULTING You must be worn out . SARA Not a bit . But I did n't succeed in walking off my worry . BOULTING What worry ? SARA Reuben  --  BOULTING Yes ? SARA Do you love me ? BOULTING Good God , Sara ! SARA Why ? BOULTING What an extraordinary question ! SARA Only extraordinary that it needs to be asked . BOULTING Does it ? SARA Does it ? BOULTING Certainly not . SARA Let me put it another way , then . When was the last time you told me so ? BOULTING I 'm sure I do n't know . I do n't keep a diary of such things . SARA Perhaps you should . BOULTING I hear a curious note of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age and position . SARA I 'll tell you when it was . Last New Year 's Eve . Almost a year ago . We were dancing in the crowd  --  p. 50 BOULTING But why should  --  ? SARA  --  and you said , " I love you , Sara , " and you meant it and I thanked you  --  and I meant it , too . BOULTING I shall try to have the calendar re-arranged for you , my dear . Made bursting with December Thirty-firsts . ( SARA looks at him for a long time ) SARA ( Softly ) When did it happen , Reuben ? And how ? When did we begin to grow apart ? If I could know the time  --  the day  --  the moment ,  --  then , maybe , I could unravel it all  --  and find a way back to you . BOULTING Or to yourself . SARA Or to myself . BOULTING ( Satisfied ) Exactly . SARA We 've become strangers . Worse . We 're strangers who seem annoyingly familiar to one another . BOULTING You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this ? Truthfully ? BOULTING I feel only that you approach middle age with less grace than I should have supposed . SARA It is n't that , Reuben . Believe me. p. 51 BOULTING Of course it is , old girl . Your condition is perfectly normal . ( He turns back to his paper . SARA is shocked and hurt ) SARA ( Quietly ) And you were once the gentlest creature I knew I remember it as your earliest attraction " Miss Ballard , may I present Mr. Boulting ? " , and our fingers touched for the first time . I had never known such a tender touch . And when we danced , it was the same . And when you spoke . And when you looked at me  --  oh , that was the gentlest touch of all Now , quite suddenly , it seems , we sit here and your words are blows . ( BOULTING rises and moves about , impatiently ) BOULTING You want a holiday , Sara . Now , why not arrange it ? SARA No . BOULTING You 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SARA Who is ? BOULTING Please , Sara ! SARA I 'm not ill , Reuben . BOULTING But you are tired . And restive . And fatigued . SARA No . BOULTING How else can you explain this astonishing new attitude ? p. 52 SARA A shock . I 've had a bad shock . Or a good one . I do n't know which . BOULTING What ? SARA I saw you as you used to be . ( BOULTING laughs , shortly ) BOULTING In a dream ? SARA No . BOULTING Am I expected to follow all this ? ( No reply ) And why was it a shock may I ask ? SARA Because all at once I knew that the man I had loved and married  --  no longer lives in this house . BOULTING Sara , I 'm worried about you . SARA I am , too . BOULTING What is it you want of me ? SARA Only what you promised . BOULTING You want the sun to stand still , is that it ? SARA I want you to be the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her face upward , tenderly ) BOULTING ( Softly ) Sara , dear  --  why do n't you put all this into a poem ? We all need a release of some sort . I have mine in my work , of course . Now , why do n't you go off somewhere and write a poem or two ? You wrote some rather creditable verse at one time , I remember . p. 53 SARA ( Just as softly ) Yes . Meaning and fulfillment on paper . I 've known enough of that . I want some fulfillment in my life  --  and some meaning in my bed . ( BOULTING straightens up , suddenly ) BOULTING I may have changed to your dissatisfaction , Sara . But you have changed as well . I have never before known you to say a vulgar thing . SARA Vulgar ,  --  to want love ? BOULTING You have my love . SARA ( Shaking her head ) Only the trappings , the outward signs When we kiss  --  once it was an act of love , now , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . BOULTING We do n't ? SARA Of course not . In your eyes , I am a sad sentimentalist , a hopeless romantic , aging pathetically . And you are , to me , a leader who has lost his way , an ambitious conformist . Worst of all , you seem to care less and less what I think , and I  --  Do you remember how we used to strive to make the other proud ? What 's our goal now ? BOULTING ( Laughing ) There you are ! You 've written your poem ! SARA ( With a sort of smile ) You 're wrong to laugh at me , Reuben . ( The telephone rings ) p. 54 BOULTING Sara , Sara  --  come back to earth . SARA You 're wrong to laugh . ( BOULTING closes the door to the hall as EVELYN answers the telephone , shutting her from view and sound ) BOULTING This vision you speak of  --  you know , the shock  --  the reincarnation of my former wonder  --  tell me more of that . SARA I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too . That it might affect you . BOULTING What on the good , green earth are you talking about , Sara ? ( There is a long pause , as SARA considers the wisdom of conveying the idea at this moment . ) SARA Sam . ( It takes a few seconds to sink in . He stands rigid , watching her , a frown on his face . Then , he bursts into new laughter . ) BOULTING I know , Sara , I know . I 'm wrong to laugh  --  but really ! ( The laughter dies ) Dear Fenn . He could n't be nicer , or more able  --  I 'm fond of him , as you know  --  still , do n't tell me that I was ever like him . SARA You were . BOULTING Oh , it 's too awful to contemplate . All that hearty impracticality  --  that uncompromising heat . Well , I suppose I did have it . I see what you mean . But I 'm amazed that you find it still attractive . p. 55 SARA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know anything about his heart . SARA Have you looked for it ? BOULTING Certainly not . I 'd consider it an imposition . He 's paid for the use of his hours , his training , his industry and intelligence . His heart is his own and no concern of mine . SARA I see . BOULTING Sara , for clarity 's sake  --  will you forgive me one foolish question ? SARA Yes ? BOULTING Do you want me to be like him ? SARA Of course not . BOULTING Well , then  --  ? SARA I want you to be what he promises . BOULTING He 'll learn . SARA That may be . BOULTING ( Smiling ) He 's so young ! SARA ( Pointing ) That 's what I mean . BOULTING What ? SARA You say " he 's so young "  --  now , why do n't you say , " I 'm so old ? " p. 56 BOULTING Because I do n't feel it . Not at all . SARA Then what 's become of all our fine plans ? BOULTING @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too many of our fine plans , as you call them , are not only fine , but impossible . An adjustment of the ideal to the practical is the beginning of wisdom . SARA And of rigor mortis . BOULTING It 's far easier to dream a complete Utopia than it is to build one small bridge across a brook ! Show me your Sam in twenty years or so . The world will have changed him far more than he will have changed the world . SARA I shall be disappointed . BOULTING Wait and see . SARA It 's quite a spark he has . BOULTING And are you prepared to fan it ? For twenty years ? Your arms will tire , Sara . I warn you . SARA Well , if they do  --  ( There is a soft knock at the door ) BOULTING Yes ? ( SAM opens the door and comes into the room . He carries a large manila envelope ) SAM Good evening , sir . Ma'am . p. 57 SARA Hello , Sam , dear . BOULTING Well , young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we , Sara ? Talk of the devil , what ? Have your ears been burning ? SAM No , sir . They 've been listening . BOULTING What 's that ? SAM I was in the hall  --  heard my name  --  could n't resist . ( BOULTING is not so much embarrassed as he is annoyed ) BOULTING Are you in the habit of eavesdropping , Fenn ? SAM Yes , sir . I am . Eavesdropping and reading other people 's mail . All my life . I just ca n't help it . SARA You should see a psychiatrist . SAM I would , but what if he cured me ? ( He hands the envelope to BOULTING ) Four copies here , sir . Two went to Hutch . He 'll have enough made for the press . BOULTING Thank you . ( He takes the envelope , gets out the copies , puts on his glasses , and begins reading ) Has this been proofread , Fenn ? SAM Yes , sir . I did it myself . Not only that , but I read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Inquiring ) Yes ? p. 58 SAM Delicious . It tasted like a banana split . ( To SARA ) Have you ever noticed that , ma'am ? SARA Noticed what ? SAM How some words  --  some phrases  --  have a good taste on your tongue ? " Liberty and justice for all  --  . " ( He licks his chops ) Used to say that every morning , from the second grade on  --  when we pledged allegiance  --  and I loved the taste long before I had any idea what the words meant . And then there are others like " haircut "  --  Medicine , that one . SARA Stay to dinner , Sam . We 're having roast lamb , but you can have the Gettysburg address . BOULTING Hmmm . Listen to this . ( He reads ) " My old friend John Morley has asked , And what is this smile of the world , to win which we are bidden to sacrifice our moral manhood ; this frown of the world , whose terrors are more awful than the withering up of truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ souls of us ? " ( He looks up ) Now , that 's a good question , is n't it ? SARA Yes . Are you going to tell the answer ? BOULTING Not tonight , dear , not tonight . ( Rising ) I 'd better dress , I think . Drop up before you leave , will you , Fenn ? p. 59 SAM ( Also rising ) Of course , sir . BOULTING Some questions about the Brunio matter . I find too many of the references unclear . SAM ( Troubled ) Is that so ? BOULTING Yes , and there seems to be such wads of content analysis ! It 's the use of those pamphlets that matters here , do n't you agree ?  --  as much as their content . Suppose a citizen wrapped a thousand copies of the Constitution into a single package  --  dropped it from a height and fractured a few skulls , would the content be a valid defense ? ( He laughs ) You do n't think that 's a poser , do you ? ( BOULTING goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . BOULTING returns ) BOULTING Excuse me , but  --  when you were listening at the door a moment ago  --  ? SAM Yes , sir ? BOULTING Just how much did you hear ? ( SAM thinks for a moment ) SAM You were saying , " Show me your Sam in twenty years  --  . " And so on . BOULTING Oh . SAM I can hardly wait . p. 60 BOULTING To prove me wrong , Sam ? SAM No , sir . Just to see . BOULTING What a pity you came so late . You missed the best of it . A few minutes earlier and you would have heard my wife telling me that she loves you . ( He smiles warmly and goes out , closing the door . SAM is looking at the door , listening to BOULTING ascend the stairs . SARA moves as far as she can , across the room ) SARA Sam . SAM Yes . SARA Please do n't say what you feel is expected of you . SAM This is n't the way I meant  --  SARA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SAM All right . SARA Reuben was joking , of course . SAM I see . SARA Or trying to . SAM Should I have laughed ? ( SARA looks at him as he searches her eyes . She turns away and shakes her head in answer to his question . ) SARA Please forget it , Sam . Can you ? p. 61 SAM I can pretend to . SARA All right , then . How are things at the Court ? SAM I 'd like to forget that , too . SARA Trouble ? SAM Only my own . SARA Such as ? SAM Oh , hell ! SARA Tell me , Sam . Let me be a friend . SAM I want to leave . It comes down to that . SARA Any more ? SAM No , ma'am . SARA I 've decided something . SAM Yes ? SARA I do n't want you to call me " ma'am " any more . Ever . SAM Fine with me . " Mrs. Boulting ? " " Sara ? " What ? SARA Whatever you wish , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SARA Will you stay to dinner ? SAM Will you let me make a speech ? SARA Alice Widmayer is here with us , Reuben 's mother . She wants to meet you . p. 62 SAM A chaperone . SARA Not really . SAM I think I 'd better not , though , anyway . SARA Why ? SAM I have a feeling I 'm going to become more disagreeable by the hour tonight . SARA We wo n't mind . SAM No , I think I 'll just go home and call you up . Will you be free to talk for a long time ? SARA Do it here . SAM I 'm better on the telephone . SARA I 'm not . SAM ( With all his love ) Sara . Sara . SARA Do n't ! SAM Sara , this is torture . SARA Yes . SAM And no way out ? SARA I do n't know . SAM Something tells me to get away . I 've only stayed up to now in the crazy hope  --  SARA Yes ? SAM You . That somehow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . SARA Well , we have . Consider that we have . p. 63 SAM And now ? ( SARA makes a gesture of helplessness ) The beginning is the end . Is that it ? SARA There 's no other way . This must be all . This knowing . Most lives are meagre . I 'm grateful for you in mine . SAM But I 'm not content . SARA You 'll never be content . That 's what makes you what you are . SAM I 'm nothing , or I 'd see a way . SARA No . We 're caught by convention  --  by things as they are . ( SAM moves to her ) SAM Sara . Darling  --  SARA No . Do n't be near me . Do n't . Sit down . ( He does so ) And I will , too . ( She sits ) I 'm much older than you , Sam . And about some things , much wiser . Do n't run away . Being here , doing what you do , is part of your road . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hard . SARA Why ? SAM Oh , it 's the old story of disenchantment . Before I came , even the words  --  Supreme Court of the United States  --  poetry . The first time I saw the chamber , it stopped my heart . I knew that I was looking into the well of wisdom the place of final justice  --  and the nine men who sat their were gods to me . ( A pause ) p. 64 SARA And now ? SAM Now , I know one of them . From the inside . And he 's just a man  --  he 's wiser than some  --  not as wise as others . There 's a lot of envy in him , and pride  --  and  --  I guess you know this  --  he 'd rather make good than anything . Just a man . SARA But is n't that as it should be ? Men governed by men  --  judged by men ? SAM Well , yes . SARA If the judges become gods , Sam , is n't the whole idea spoiled ? SAM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All right . ( She moves away ) SAM Sara , I know you 're trying to stay off our subject  --  I am , too , but  --  SARA No , I 'm not . SAM I 've been sitting here practicing a question . Now , if I can bring myself to ask it  --  SARA Go on . SAM ( Quietly ) How can this be ? Much as I want to believe it  --  it 's unbelievable . What can you see in me ? SARA So much of what I once saw in my husband . There 's only one man I 've ever loved . He used to be Reuben  --  and now  --  . Please stay , Sam . For all our sakes . p. 65 SAM All ? SARA For mine , you 're so reassuring  --  but that 's selfish . For yours  --  you have work to do here . SAM Not the kind I  --  SARA Most of all  --  for Reuben 's  --  you 're his touch with the future . You can help him  --  you 're the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sara . SARA Even so . SAM I 've got no right to want to get inside his head and push things around . SARA Of course you have . And let him get inside yours . Good , healthy exercise . Why not ? SAM ( With a little laugh ) Jack the Giant Killer . SARA Reuben respects your views . SAM Oh , well . SARA I know he does . SAM How ? SARA Well , for instance  --  he told me that you 'd been most original and  --  brilliant on the Brunio case . SAM ( Jolted ) What did you say ? SARA Yes , he told me how hard you 'd been working on that , and how well . p. 66 SAM Listen , Sara . This is important . To me . Are you sure he said that ? SARA Yes . SAM Could you be more exact ? I mean , what did he say , exactly ? SARA Well , I do n't remember it all  --  but I 'm sure he said that you had been most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Thank you . ( A little pause ) Sara  --  Listen  --  SARA ( Steering the safe course ) I 'm not clear about this Brunio case . SAM You should be . Everyone should be . It 's the big number this session  --  at least that 's my feeling . I do n't know that they 've ever handled a more important one . SARA Why ? SAM Because this is where they define  --  try to define  --  free expression and set the limits for  --  I 'm not supposed to discuss it . Am I ? SARA No  --  go ahead . SAM ( Suddenly afire ) All right , consider it . Here 's Victor Brunio , according to varying interpretations a Bolshevik , a Christian , a Socialist , a reformer , a Free-thinker , an idiot . In his own country he was a young revolutionary . Arrested , sentenced to death , escaped , and made his way here . Then he got  --  p. 67 SARA When ? SAM Nine and a half years ago . Then he got a job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Italian-American newspaper . He went to night school to learn English and  --  this is a good part  --  married his teacher . With her help , he became a citizen and had three children . Started a business of his own  --  a little printing shop in Norwalk , Connecticut . Let 's see , now . Then the war , and he went to work in a factory there , making parts for Springfield rifles  --  and ran his printing shop in off hours . He hated the war , intellectually and instinctively , but there is no record whatsoever  --  remember that  --  of active opposition . Then  --  when the war ended , he conceived his great scheme . Days , he 'd work in his shop . And every night , he 'd go back there and manufacture little leaflets and tracts for his own use . Mostly a strange array of quotations from Walt Whitman , Marx , Lincoln , Garibaldi , Debs , Tom Paine and , of course , Victor Brunio . I 've seen some of these things  --  they seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instruments for changing the world for the better . Next , he acquired a collection of telephone directories from many cites  --  and systematically , at his own expense  --  he began mailing this stuff all over the country . Spent every cent he earned working twelve , fourteen hours a day . Now , of course , a telephone directory is n't especially selective , and so , before long , his material fell into the hands of people who thought it highly subversive . The stuff was traced  --  and then what with the Palmer raids and the damned witch hunt  --  well , you know  --  he was arrested . One court after another , trial after trial . His plan was to spread his ideas of enlightenment . Free speech , is n't there ? Well , there 've been victories and defeats . Conviction , appeals , reversals  --  the last court sentenced him to twenty years ' imprisonment . Now it 's come to us  --  and will be decided , finally  --  oh , how finally  --  some time next week . p. 68 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's absolute ice down there and so it 's hard to tell . I think he was impressed by the defense brief  --  maybe not . I do n't know . He asked me to copy it for his file . Said he 'd bet anything Clarence Darrow was in on it . He may be right . This Brunio has a fiery Defense Committee . SARA Sounds to me as though he needs it . SAM You remember the Holmes-Brandeis dissent in the Abrams case ? SARA No . SAM You know , when he said  --  Holmes wrote it , and he said that Abrams had as much right to publish and distribute his pamphlet as the Government has to publish and distribute the Constitution . Justice Boulting asked to see that the other day . SARA I 'm sure you influence him far more than Mr. Justice Holmes . SAM No . SARA He does n't like Holmes . SAM I do . SARA When we first came to Washington , he  --  ( STEWART comes in ) Yes , Stewart ? STEWART Excuse me , ma'am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Mr. Fenn. p. 69 SAM ( Rising ) Right away , Stewart . ( STEWART goes out , leaving the door open ) With all this Big Talk , I think I 've missed saying it out plain . SARA ( Retreating ) No . Sam . SAM I love you , Sara . I love you with all my heart  --  and hopes  --  and everything . So  --  ( He goes out and upstairs . SARA watches him . His last words have brought tears to her eyes , yet her heart is gayer and more alive than ever before . She lies back in her chair . Now her ecstasy expresses itself in a strange way . She begins to whistle . It is a lovely old tune and she whistles it softly at first , but then freer and freer . When the song is nearly ended , MRS . WIDMAYER comes in quietly . She stands in the doorway for a moment listening , then comes into the room . SARA sees her , smiles , but continues the song until it is ended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm out of practice . I have n't whistled much lately . ( They look at each other ) MRS . WIDMAYER You look fine . SARA Thank you . MRS . WIDMAYER You look a lot better than you 've got any right to . p. 70 SARA Why ? MRS . WIDMAYER What 's goin ' on around here ? SARA Nothing , darling . The same  --  old  --  nothing . MRS . WIDMAYER I can keep a secret . Come on . SARA I have n't any secrets . MRS . WIDMAYER Sara , I knew things had changed an hour after I got in . I just smelled it , you might say . Thought I could ferret it myself , so that 's why I did n't ask right out . But either I 'm dumber than I used to be , or everybody else is smarter . SARA What are you talking about ? MRS . WIDMAYER You know what about . About whatever it is that 's turned you from half dead to double alive . SARA Am I ? MRS . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She thinks , gives up ) Ca n't remember a damn thing any more unless I write it down . ( She gets out a little notebook , consults it ) Oh , yes . ( She looks up ) Is Reubie going to resign and get you out of here ? SARA Oh , no . MRS . WIDMAYER No , I did n't think much of that guess myself ( She looks into her book again  --  scratches out the first note , looks up again ) Is he going to get some better job  --  or run for somethin ' ? p. 71 SARA Not so far as I know . ( A pause , during which MRS . WIDMAYER looks into her book again , scratches out again ) MRS . WIDMAYER Well , then , have you got a beau ? Or has Reubie got a girl ? Sometimes that 's just as big a relief . ( SARA laughs and shakes her head ) Well , then , I 'm stumped . ( She puts away her notebook ) I could have sworn there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air . SARA You 're a wonder , Alice . MRS . WIDMAYER I sure am . I think it comes from not takin ' any of that medicine they give me . SARA You do n't ? MRS . WIDMAYER Down the drain it goes  --  not down me . Stops it up sometimes , too . ( SAM comes in , carrying two copies of the speech ) SARA This is Mr. Fenn , darling . Sam , Mrs. Widmayer . SAM Oh , how do you do ? MRS . WIDMAYER Well , you 're a nice , healthy lookin ' young fellow . SAM Thank you . MRS . WIDMAYER How come it has n't got you down ? SAM Well  --  p. 72 MRS . WIDMAYER I get out here every year about this time in the session , and usually , the clerk has gotten to looking peaked and shifty and like he ' going to bust out cryin ' any minute . SAM I rise above it , ma'am . MRS . WIDMAYER Above the Supreme Court ? SAM ( Laughing ) Sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a place . ( To Sara ) Does Reubie know about it ? SAM Excuse me . The Justice asked me to give you these . ( He hands a copy to SARA . She takes it across the room to the desk , gets her glasses and begins to read . He offers one to MRS . WIDMAYER ) MRS . WIDMAYER ( Suspiciously ) What is it ? SAM A copy of his speech for tonight . MRS . WIDMAYER Give mine to the Salvation Army . SAM It 's very good . MRS . WIDMAYER I do n't care what he says . What 's the difference ? What he does , that 's the thing . A man 'll say anything . Any old thing that seems like a good idea at the time . You 'll find that out . p. 73 SAM Do you think that 's true , Sara ? ( A quick correction ) Mrs. Boulting ? ( But the slip has not escaped MRS . WIDMAYER . She watches them carefully , smiling ) I 'd like to argue the point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SAM It 's just that I 'm not sure of the protocol . I feel I should defend my Justice  --  but against his mother  --  ? MRS . WIDMAYER Listen , he 's just another stuffed shirt to me . I 've been proud of him  --  lots of times . But not lately . ( BOULTING comes in . He looks distinguished and resplendent in white tie and tails . He carries a top hat and coat ) BOULTING Here we are  --  ! MRS . WIDMAYER ( To SAM ) What 'd I tell you ? Just another stuffed shirt . BOULTING ( Coolly ) Thank you , Mother . MRS . WIDMAYER Welcome , I 'm sure . BOULTING Women , women , women ! Avoid them , Fenn . Avoid them all , always . MRS . WIDMAYER ( To BOULTING ) I 'd like to know where you 'd be if you 'd avoided me always ! ( STEWART , in his chauffeur 's clothes again , passes through the hall . SARA is reading the speech ) p. 74 BOULTING ( To SARA ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pause ) BOULTING ( In fair control ) Any word of praise ? ( The moment is tense ) SARA I 'm sure it will be a great success . BOULTING That is not a word of praise . Good night . SARA Good night . BOULTING Good night , Mother . MRS . WIDMAYER Good night , boy . Do n't forget to stand up good and straight ! ( BOULTING goes out , followed by SAM . EVELYN steps into the room ) EVELYN Excuse me . What time dinner tonight , madam ? We got a little mixed up . SARA What time is it now ? EVELYN Oh , about  --  MRS . WIDMAYER ( Looking at her watch ) Twenty after six . SARA ( To EVELYN ) Well , say at about eight . And we 'll be three . EVELYN Yes , madam . p. 75 SARA Is that all right ? EVELYN Sure . ( She goes out ) MRS . WIDMAYER That Sam . He 's all right . SARA Is n't he ? MRS . WIDMAYER Sure like to know him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 's dining with us . MRS . WIDMAYER You would n't mind , would you , honey  --  if I asked Evelyn to just bring a tray up ? SARA Of course I 'd mind . MRS . WIDMAYER Too bad , ' count of that 's what I 'm going to do . SARA Why ? MRS . WIDMAYER Because I 'm expectin ' a headache and because you and the boy deserve to be alone . SARA ( Turning swiftly ) Alice ! ( A long pause ) MRS . WIDMAYER Sara , Sara . You lucky girl . SARA There 's no hiding it , is there ? MRS . WIDMAYER Might as well try to hide breathing . SARA And you 're not shocked ? p. 76 MRS . WIDMAYER I 'm so far along , Sara , there 's nothin ' shocks me . I 've seen everything , damn near . And in seventy years  --  a little more , if you want the truth  --  I 've done everything , too . And I can look back now and remember most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one single thing I 've ever done  --  so long as I enjoyed doin ' it at the time . No . I 'm only sorry about the things I could have done and did n't . SARA ( Quietly ) Thank you , darling . MRS . WIDMAYER Does Reubie know ? SARA In a way , yes . MRS . WIDMAYER How do you mean , in a way ? SARA He jokes about it . ( SAM comes back ) MRS . WIDMAYER Does n't seem so funny to me ! SAM What does n't , ma'am ? MRS . WIDMAYER Sit down , Sam . Let me examine you . ( SAM sits . She rises and looks him over carefully ) Why is it you 're all so nice when you 're young ? SAM Are we ? MRS . WIDMAYER Pretty much . Then , along with age , comes more and more cussedness . Now , with us girls it 's more the reverse . We start out awful and get mellower . As a rule , that is . ( She looks at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like you  --  a lot . Then he grew up . And up and up and up and finally , so up , that now I ca n't even see him any more . Going to leave you now . ( SAM rises ) p. 77 SARA Are you sure ? It is n't necessary . MRS . WIDMAYER Not necessary , but real desirable . Sam , let me shake your hand . ( They shake hands . She considers his grip . ) Good . That 's good . ( She goes . A moment passes , as they adjust to being alone ) SAM I would like to stay , please , if it 's still all right . SARA Of course it is . SAM Thank you . SARA Thank you . ( A pause . SAM 'S impulse is to join her , but he stands , watching her ) SAM Sara . SARA ( Softly ) Say it , darling , say it . SAM I love you so . SARA How strange to hunger for a sound . SAM Forever , forever . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exaggerate . SAM You 're the beginning and the end . I 'll always love you . Only you . SARA No , Sam . You 'll always love . That 's enough . That 's as it should be . I 'm glad it 's me tonight . p. 78 SAM Nothing else seems to matter . SARA Oh , Sam . SAM I know . SARA In another world , maybe  --  in another time  --  SAM We make our world . SARA It is n't true , Sam . SAM We 're quarreling . SARA But it is n't true . Our world makes us . ( She closes her eyes ) If I close my eyes  --  I can make it seem that we belong together  --  alive . ( She opens her eyes ) But if I look to see  --  if I consider carefully  --  I am Mrs. Justice Reuben Boulting  --  conventional and respectable  --  with duties and a charted life  --  and you are Sam Fenn , the attractive young man who works for my husband . SAM Then close your eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . SAM moves to her , now bends to kiss her . His arms are around her as the kiss ends . ) Close your eyes . ( They kiss again and embrace one another with the strength of passion and the fear of loneliness ) @x ( BOULTING clears his throat and shifts position , slightly . SARA comes back . She looks about for the evening paper , sees it , but decides against the possibility of getting it without awakening her husband . She moves across the room ) BOULTING Oh , do stop running about , Sara ! SARA I 'm sorry , dear . I could n't tell if you were thinking or sleeping . p. 80 BOULTING ( Sitting up ) What time is it ? ( He sneezes ) SARA About four-thirty , I think . I 've only just come in . BOULTING ( Rising ) Good day ? SARA Yes , thank you . ( BOULTING goes to get a cigar . As he passes SARA , he leans to her automatically and comes within a half inch of kissing her cheek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This do , ma'am ? SARA Thank you . ( EVELYN goes out . SARA arranges the flowers ) BOULTING ( Lighting his cigar ) We finished that damned Brunio business today . SARA Yes , I saw a headline . BOULTING May it rest in peace . SARA Do you think it will ? BOULTING It 's over . Two days ' discussion  --  three , at most  --  and the Cause boys will turn to something new , thank fortune . They have no choice , of course . There is nothing further to be done . Nothing . SARA A five to four decision , was n't it ? p. 81 BOULTING Yes . SARA They always sadden me , somehow . BOULTING Why ? SARA Such a tiny margin between hope and hopelessness . Surely there must be a greater difference between right and wrong than one man 's view . BOULTING Five , Sara . Not one . And justices , not men . SARA But if one of the five had  --  BOULTING Really , Sara ! Do n't ask me to explain fundamental procedure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . SARA Of course . BOULTING I am infuriated beyond words , beyond reason , whenevre one of our cases is tried in newspapers , in magazines , at Madison Square Garden . Why do n't they leave it to the Court , which has , after all , the best access to the facts ? If they do n't consider us competent  --  ( He trails off ) SARA Yes ? BOULTING You should have heard your friend Holmes intoning another version of his old , old song . ( With mock pomposity ) "  --  Let us have a free trade in ideas  --  " and so on , "  --  the best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market  --  " and so on , and so on , and so on . To Holmes truth is apparently interchangeable with mousetraps . And you tell me that his is not a common mind . p. 82 SARA He charms me . BOULTING Yes . He charms a few of his brethren , too . Fortunately not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again ) Damn ! SARA A cold ? BOULTING I do n't think so . Something in this room , I suppose . SARA Me ? ( A short pause . BOULTING looks at her in annoyance ) BOULTING What is this coy charade you 've been enacting this past week ? ( SARA looks away ) What are these sly and mysterious little cries ? SARA Another time , Reuben . BOULTING For a week now  --  more  --  you 've been trying to provoke me . Why ? It 's your old trick  --  I know it so well  --  whenever you have something unpleasant to say to me  --  you deliberately cause a row  --  then let it fly in heat . But we 're getting on , Sara  --  you and I. We no longer have the physical energy which that sort of game requires . So why not simply say what you have to say ? Quietly and plainly . SARA Perhaps that would be best . BOULTING Of course . SARA ( Quietly and plainly ) Sam and I. We 're together . ( A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . BOULTING All ? But , of course , I know that . SARA What ? BOULTING You underestimate me , Sara . I am not so callous and unfeeling as you suppose . I 've known from the beginning . From the night of my Shoreham speech . ( SARA is startled ) SARA And never a word ? BOULTING What was there to say ? " Do n't , Sara ! " ? Would that have prevented you ? SARA Reuben  --  BOULTING ( Bitterly ) " How did he know ? " Is that your wonder ? Of course . Woman 's intuition  --  so often possessed by men  --  I among them . In this instance , it was less than magical  --  since I had such close daily contact with you both . All this week  --  he has never so much as mentioned your name to me . A clue ! And you . I 've known you so well and so long . I needed nothing more than to see the way in which you now carry your head . Proud , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In many ways , Sara , I am glad for you . I know how unhappy you have been . SARA And it means so little to you ? p. 84 BOULTING What am I to do ? Suggest , Sara . Your imagination is obviously livelier than mine . Be in my place for a moment and tell me  --  what is my part in all this ? Should I thrash you with my belt as though I were a slum savage ? SARA Perhaps you should . BOULTING Perhaps . But silence is all that occurred to me . I assumed that we understood one another . SARA No . BOULTING Better if you had n't told me . I ca n't imagine why you did . It 's quite ugly  --  in the open . SARA I have never kept anything from you . That 's why , now  --  BOULTING Nonsense . SARA I promise you , Reuben  --  BOULTING Of course you have . And I from you . As it should be . Where would any of us be  --  how could we live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? It 's not so much what we say or do  --  but what we omit  --  that makes us civilized . Most of your thoughts and feelings  --  through the years  --  have been your own . As much your own as the air you inhale . So it is with us all . This adventure must be your own . We can not let it be any part of our life together . p. 85 SARA But it is  --  maybe the most important part ever  --  maybe it 's a sign  --  do n't turn away , Reuben . We 're in a trouble . BOULTING I beg you not to make more of it than necessary . Stay real . SARA If you know me , as you say you do  --  can you think me frivolous ? BOULTING Sara , I have not given you a birthday gift  --  or acknowledged the day in any way , since you were forty . That was meant as a kindness . Growing old need n't be tragic . You 'll learn that for yourself one day . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last faint , but desperate stirrings and I 'll do what I can  --  stand by you  --  until  --  ( He stops , there is a pause ) SARA So all your wisdom and understanding ends here . Where we need it most . BOULTING Does it ? SARA Why do we blame each other , rather than ourselves ? BOULTING Because it 's easier . ( A pause ) SARA We 're ending now , Reuben , are n't we ? BOULTING No . SARA We are , and I 'm thinking of our life together  --  what it used to be  --  how shiningly romantic ! p. 86 BOULTING Romantic ! Romantic ! Would you like me to rent a canoe and take you paddling down the Potomac ? SARA Yes , I would . BOULTING By God , I believe you . You really would . SARA But why not ? No precedent ? BOULTING Please do n't jibe . SARA What if our canoe shocked a few of the conventionals we live with  --  a few might even follow us ! Who knows ? We might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BOULTING Doubtless . SARA Do n't you see it , Reuben ? Wo n't you ? How we 've been swallowed up ? How we cringe before the bogey of " what will people say " ? BOULTING Yes , and I see that I am married to a restless wife . SARA What a word for it ! BOULTING The true one . SARA Not at all ! You look at me without seeing  --  and at yourself . BOULTING My station grants me few luxuries , Sara . ( MRS . WIDMAYER comes in ) SARA Hello , dear . Come in . MRS . WIDMAYER Who 's winning ? ( BOULTING moves away . SARA lights a cigarette . MRS . WIDMAYER sits down with her knitting ) Do you give these little entertainments often ? p. 87 BOULTING ( Irritably ) All right , Ma . That 's enough . MRS . WIDMAYER ( Snapping back ) I 'd have thought you had enough to do with arguments down where you work  --  without carryin ' on at home , too . Or is it just for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To MRS . WIDMAYER ) Did you find what you wanted downtown ? MRS . WIDMAYER They did n't have it in gray , so I took red . I 'm glad they did n't have it in gray . ( SARA smiles ) Then I went over to the Court , you know . SARA Yes . MRS . WIDMAYER ( To BOULTING ) You did n't wave at me once , did you ? BOULTING I suppose not . I do n't remember . MRS . WIDMAYER ( To SARA ) He used to wave at me whenever I came . Today he just looked up , twice . While I was there , that is . I did n't stay long . SARA Were n't you enjoying it ? I always do . MRS . WIDMAYER Like watching a bunch of mud turtles . ( To BOULTING ) And I could n't hardly hear a thing you said , when you got to readin ' yours off . Mumble , mumble , mumble . What 's the matter with you ? It was almost like you were ashamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were sayin ' . p. 88 SARA ( To BOULTING ) Was that the Brunio decision ? BOULTING Yes . MRS . WIDMAYER Could n't hear one damn word . ( BOULTING starts out of the room ) BOULTING Excuse me , please . ( He goes ) MRS . WIDMAYER Sara . ( She beckons . SARA comes to her ) I just thought I 'd tell you . It 's around . SARA Around ? MRS . WIDMAYER You and the boy . ( SARA sits ) SARA I 'm not surprised . MRS . WIDMAYER Do n't you care ? SARA Not much . Most of what 's whispered behind fans down here is untrue . Everyone knows that . So even true gossip is seldom believed . MRS . WIDMAYER Clever girl , Sara . SARA How did you come on it ? MRS . WIDMAYER Ellie . I had lunch with her at the Willard . And when she looked around and leaned over and slitted her little tadpole eyes and said , " I 'm not sure I should tell you this , Alice  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She claims she heard it at that Canadian thing yesterday  --  who was it  --  Lady North ? p. 89 SARA I believe so . Yes . MRS . WIDMAYER Well , there you are . SARA Where ? MRS . WIDMAYER I said to Ellie , " I 'm goin ' to repeat this to Sara and you better tell those biddies to beware ! " Well , she begged and begged and almost cried and so then she made me swear not to tell you . SARA And did you ? MRS . WIDMAYER Swore on my life . SARA Alice ! MRS . WIDMAYER Do n't give it a thought . I been swearin' ' on my life all my life . And look at me . ( A pause ) SARA I wonder how  --  ? MRS . WIDMAYER Do n't . It 'll just get you confused . A man and a woman in love are like  --  well , like one of those radio stations that sends out music and anybody that listens , hears . SARA Yes . MRS . WIDMAYER What about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he chooses to close his eyes . MRS . WIDMAYER Just like him . ( A pause ) SARA ( In despair ) Oh dear ! p. 90 MRS . WIDMAYER No one can help you in this , Sara . There 's a lot to consider . But let me tell you this much . Have your own way . I 've lived a real long time , and I can tell you  --  there 's nothin ' better than to have your own way . Be sure . Make it a good way  --  and then , doggonit , have it ! SARA I wish you were n't leaving just yet , Alice . I need a friend . MRS . WIDMAYER I 'm not worried about you . SARA I am . MRS . WIDMAYER That 's why . SARA If I could get through to Reuben  --  if he 'd help . But he shuts me out  --  wo n't listen  --  ( There is a knock at the door ) Yes ? ( SAM appears ) SARA Come in , Sam . ( MRS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes in . He moves quickly towards SARA , sees MRS . WIDMAYER , and stops . He looks drawn and tired and tense ) Are you all right , darling ? ( SAM glances at MRS . WIDMAYER , uncomfortably ) SAM Fine , Mrs. Boulting , fine . SARA " Sara . " ( She looks at MRS . WIDMAYER , as does SAM . MRS . WIDMAYER returns his look , with kindness ) p. 91 MRS . WIDMAYER It 's all right , Sam . ( SAM looks at SARA , in mild confusion ) SARA It seems we 're transparent . And not only to Alice . SAM I 'd just as soon have it so . Would n't you ? SARA I suppose . MRS . WIDMAYER Do n't look so worried , Sam . There 's a lot of people on your side . ( She starts out ) SARA Do n't go . MRS . WIDMAYER ( Sharply ) Do n't be tellin ' me what to do all the time ! ( She goes out and closes the door behind her ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( SAM moves to SARA and takes her in his arms . They cling to each other . A whisper ) Darling ! Oh , thank you , darling ! SAM I had to see you . There 's no one else I can turn to . Only you . ( Highly agitated , he hesitates for a moment ) They finished Brunio this noon . SARA Yes , I know . SAM Five to four . ( Shaking his head ) You do n't , really . You 'd be crying if you did . p. 92 SARA It 's just one defeat , Sam . SAM No , not this one . This one finishes me here . SARA Wait . SAM ( His voice unsteady ) Listen , Sara . I know this case . I worked on it  --  I know it as well as any of them . Every brief , every record , deposition . I did the summaries myself . No bias , as God is my judge . It was an honest job . No emotion , even . I handed it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got him the answers . It all fit  --  all clear  --  he thanked me . Said I 'd done a good job  --  and then  --  at the last minute , before I knew it  --  threw the whole thing away and went along with the die-hards . You should have heard Holmes read the dissent  --  there were tears in the old man 's eyes . This is an awful day , Sara . SARA Keep your head , darling . SAM There are some things it 's better not to know . I wish I were still deluded about him . He 's cold . A cold man . The life 's gone out of him . And he 's the man who once said  --  " Beware lest the living come to be governed by the dead . " Long ago , but he said it . SARA I remember . SAM We 're face to face with it now , my Sara . p. 93 SARA With what ? SAM With what to do . SARA I beg you , Sam . SAM What ? SARA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come , Sara . The time is here . We 're up against it now . The time ! ( BOULTING comes in ) BOULTING Hello . SAM Sir . BOULTING Tea out ? SARA Very soon , now . BOULTING You look pale , Sam . Better coast a bit . SAM I 'm all right , sir . BOULTING Worked very hard this last , have n't you ? SAM No , sir . BOULTING Oh ? SARA Sam thinks  --  not hard enough . BOULTING What does that mean ? SAM Just that in the light of what we studied  --  what we learned  --  I do n't understand the Brunio decision . BOULTING Yes , it is complicated . I 'll go over it with you one day and  --  p. 94 SAM I 'd like that . ( BOULTING sits ) BOULTING I found it dull , on the whole , did n't you ? SAM No . I thought it was as exciting as a hanging . BOULTING What is the matter with you , Sam ? ( SAM shakes his head ) SARA He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other way . BOULTING Well , so did four of the Justices  --  ( To SAM ) so do n't feel too in the wrong . SAM It is n't that . It 's that this time , sir , I was close enough to see you think . I 'm terrified . BOULTING You 're ill . SAM That may be . SARA Do n't say any more now , Sam . SAM I think I have to . Justice Boulting  --  listen  --  you know what coming here meant to me  --  all my hopes . There was a fellow up at the school  --  did a paper on you . On thirty successive Boulting decisions . His theme was your dying faith . He traced a line . I could n't see it . We do n't give up our heroes easily . But I see it now . BOULTING You 're a fool to provoke me , Sam . p. 95 SAM There are worse things . BOULTING ( A sudden shout ) Do n't hint , my boy ! Say what you think if it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " As man is soul and body  --  so law is spirit and letter " ? BOULTING I would n't be surprised if I did . What 's that to do with  --  with today ? With Brunio ? SAM This . I believe you turned your back on the spirit and smashed him with the letter because you do n't approve of his ideas . BOULTING Do you approve of his ideas ? SAM No . But let him be heard  --  that 's what we promised  --  BOULTING You 're simplifying . SAM Yes , I am . What 's wrong with that ? I was wondering  --  I asked Sara once  --  do you ever give a thought to human beings any more , or is it just a lot of paper to you ? Do you think of the effect of your weight on others ? Say , now . Not only Brunio  --  but all the others  --  the frightened ones . Twenty years ! SARA Not for doing wrong but for believing wrong . BOULTING ( To SARA ) No . ( To SAM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to take quick action to rectify the condition . I 'm not pleased with you . No . I am not as pleased with you as I should wish to be . Loose . That is the only word . As loose in your thinking as in your morals . ( SAM is stunned ) You have no secrets from me , Fenn . Let me put it so . You dare to spout at me  --  in your position  --  laughable . Your life and your work are closely related . I find you too hot-blooded in both . The Brunio matter first . Of course , I believe , privately , personally , that he had every right to do what he did . Unfortunately , for him  --  I was not asked to pass on that right . Only on the legality of the law under which he was convicted . p. 96 SAM An excuse ! BOULTING Fenn  --  I 've lived with my conscience far longer than you have with yours . I do n't make laws . I do n't approve , in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the law and , good or bad , I am sworn to uphold it . SAM Not if it violates  --  BOULTING Let me finish , please . So long as it is constitutional , that is my only  --  my simple duty  --  SARA But ten years ago  --  less  --  you 'd have been on Holmes ' side . That 's his point . BOULTING ( To SARA ) Worthless speculation . ( To SAM ) You 'll learn , Fenn . A part of me looks upon you as an incompetent , immoral , subversive scoundrel . Outraged that at your muling and puking age you dare criticize the Supreme Court of the United States . SAM Only a part  --  BOULTING But hold on ! The rest of me is far less angry  --  shall I tell you why ? Because , having once been rather like you  --  I understand . Oh , yes . Full of rahp ! rahp ! rahp ! ( These are guttural sounds , accompanied by a shaking fist ) But time , of course , cooled me to reason . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die if you do n't learn to live . p. 97 SARA When you say live , Reuben  --  just what do you mean ? BOULTING I mean order and form and responsibility . He can hardly feel that he 's behaved well . SARA It was n't planned  --  it happened . BOULTING There 's no question of blame here . I recognize my fault in it all . Still , there is nothing to be done  --  other than wait for time to test us . SARA But meanwhile , Reuben , look ! See how we 're caught . See how we wriggle . Study this . There 's wisdom to be found here . Why do n't we do what we know we should do ? Any of us ? Now ? Why do we lie to ourselves and each other ? What is it we 're afraid of ? You were saying it only the other night . " The frown of the world "  --  That 's what makes us cling to our traps . SAM Justice Boulting  --  BOULTING Yes . SAM How soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  your permission . BOULTING Whenever you like . Now . SAM Thank you . I 'll get over there early and leave whatever with Hutch . BOULTING Very well . p. 98 SAM And the keys . SARA Wait , Sam . SAM It 's no use . BOULTING Listen to me , now . Here 's your truth . You have bungled your first great opportunity . You black-mark yourself by leaving . Take care in the future . You have failed because you refuse to understand the practical exigencies of existence . What makes you think you can have it all perfect  --  or all now ? One day you 'll see the necessity for compromise . SAM I suppose so  --  but I 'll guard against that day  --  after what I 've seen here . BOULTING You are too young , in your mind , for this post . Perhaps for any post . Grow up , my boy  --  then face the world . I 'm afraid that if I bid you goodbye  --  you would think me even more hypocritical than you already do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He goes . SARA and SAM stand silently . Time is suspended as they recognize the moment of crisis ) SAM As usual . There 's something in what he says . SARA Of course . SAM Sure , that 's the hell of it . He 's not all wrong  --  but neither am I. Whatever I 'm too much of  --  he 's not enough of . The answer lies somewhere between us . Sara . ( She shakes her head ) Please come with me. p. 99 SARA Do n't , Sam . SAM Please . SARA No , Sam . We must n't think that we  --  . No . SAM There may be a job in Geneva  --  that 's far enough away . Ellison , I told you about him , promised me that if I ever  --  SARA Sam . You 're being  --  you 're  --  it 's impossible  --  ( A pause ) SAM I know . My great Sara , I know . But how can I leave you ? SARA You 'll find a way . SAM What if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . Sara , tell me  --  please ! Deep in my heart I know there 's hope for us . ( EVELYN comes in with the tea table ) SARA Thank you , Evelyn . ( EVELYN goes out and upstairs ) You 're wrong . There is none . SAM No ! SARA None , Sam . None ! There . That 's the truth I have n't let myself say all this time . None . No hope . I 'm trapped . By time  --  convention  --  and by fear . This came badly . Too late for me . Too early for you . SAM I thought you 'd come with me . I really did . I do n't know why . This is a picture I do n't recognize . I 'm lost . p. 100 SARA Sam . SAM We 've been so rich together . All of a sudden  --  we 're worth nothing . SARA Do n't say that , Sam . It 's love that warms the earth . SAM That 's what I thought . But now you show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and oil . SARA That 's right . Of course . Thank you , Sam . I 'm awake now . SAM How do you like it ? ( She shakes her head ) Nor I. SARA When , Sam ? SAM Will I go ? SARA Yes . SAM Tomorrow . SARA And where ? SAM New York , for now . Then , I hope the League thing happens . SARA Yes . ( They look at each other for a long , long time . Then , SARA , to keep from crying , speaks ) SARA I left a pair of earrings  --  on your desk , I think . Did you find them ? SAM Yes , I did . SARA Will you send them back to me ? p. 101 SAM No . SARA Please do . I need them . SAM Not as much as I 'm going to . SARA All right . ( SAM takes a ring from his finger and hands it to her ) SAM In exchange . ( SARA looks at the ring ) SARA Thank you . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think the earrings are worth much more . SAM ( Smiling too ) I 'm sure they are . ( A pause ) SARA This is n't the best day I 've ever known . SAM ( Moving to her ) It could be ! It  --  ( BOULTING comes in ) BOULTING Still here , Fenn ? ( He drops a letter into a box on the desk ) SAM No , sir . ( He goes to SARA ) Goodbye , Sara . ( He extends his hand . She takes it ) SARA Goodbye . ( SAM leaves . There is a quiet time ) BOULTING Damned nuisance , this . I 've just written to Jonathan . He may know someone else . Difficult time , of course . p. 102 SARA ( Automatically ) You might phone him . ( BOULTING pours two cups of tea , and brings one to SARA . ) BOULTING ( A pause . BOULTING looks at the door , and laughs , expressing irony ) Strange fellow , that Fenn . I shall never understand youth . Never . Truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to confess it , but I am far too upset to work this evening . SARA That 's too bad . BOULTING Perhaps we 'll read something . Something light . Did I see a new Wodehouse about ? SARA There may be , yes . BOULTING Have some tea , Sara . Bracing . ( He sits and tips his tea , but SARA is preoccupied ) Have some tea . ( A pause ) I must remember to take two aspirin tablets . I sat for three hours directly between two head colds . Will you remind me ? SARA Yes , of course . ( He clears his throat ) BOULTING I 'd better gargle , too . SARA All right . ( A pause ) BOULTING Is it tomorrow night , the Longworths and the vaudeville show ? ( SARA walks to the desk and looks at the appointment book ) p. 103 SARA Wednesday . BOULTING Oh , good . I thought it was tomorrow . I 'd rather rest tomorrow . ( SARA is leafing through the date book , slowly SARA Reuben . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days to come  --  let 's try to understand what happened . BOULTING Not now , please . SARA Listen to my side . I 'm  --  these months have shaken me . BOULTING It 's over now . SARA Is n't it just possible we 've something to learn from all this ? How did it come about ? Why ? BOULTING You 're the one to answer that , my dear . SARA Of course . Sam was you again . BOULTING Oh , come now . SARA Reuben , I loved you long before I met you  --  long before I had ever heard your name . Then , I knew you . And you were my perfect imaginings come alive . I 'm sure I expected we 'd change with years  --  but I always hoped we 'd be the same to each other . We 're not . Then , when Sam came to us  --  BOULTING Sara , I wo n't  --  p. 104 SARA  --  That was you again . Ca n't you see that ? BOULTING Sara , believe me when I tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However fancifully you choose to paint it , color it  --  dress it up  --  I understand every bit of what happened . I hope you will not take it amiss , dear Sara , when I assure you that yours is not a unique experience in the marital scheme . It happens to so many . That second choice . That cruel trick of time , the missed connection . So often there 's a later being who awakens again the simple senses . Will it help this moment if I tell you about mine ? Please do n't look surprised , Sara . In any case , ten years ago hardly matters tonight , does it ? Just as the years to come will erase this day for you . My adventure was every bit as deep  --  passionate as yours  --  yet I checked it in time , just as you have done  --  so sensibly done . Of course , the fact that I was running for public office at the time rather forced my hand . Odd . I remember her well  --  details of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but , confession : I have forgotten her name . I 've seen her since , you know . Yes . At a New York theatre . We nodded and smiled . I 'd have made it a point to greet her and introduce you  --  but I could n't for the life of me remember her name . Emerson writes that we remember only what we wish to remember . Perhaps that explains it . p. 105 SARA And you think that Sam in our life is as small , as meaningless as she is ? BOULTING Will be , yes . SARA Then we 've missed our chance ! This happening might have saved us . Waked us back to the life we intended , but you  --  is it that you ca n't see , or that you wo n't ? BOULTING It 's that there 's nothing to see . Justify it if you like  --  a little affair is a little affair . ( He walks away from her and climbs the library step seeking a book ) SARA Reuben  --  ( He does not reply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd better take that holiday you suggested , after all . BOULTING With your young man ? SARA No . I 'm going alone . BOULTING All right . SARA You should , too , Reuben . I do n't know where there is for me , but , first chance , you should get back to Youngstown . ( He looks at her sharply ) Yes , get back there and walk the old streets and stand on the bridges and try to remember what you started out to be . Sit up all night in the park , as we used to , and remember all you said . The old house  --  have a look at that  --  and Uncle Alan 's , and the front lawn  --  and the square  --  that has some sounds you 'll hear . p. 106 BOULTING I prefer to stay where I am  --  and if you were practical , you would , too . SARA But we 've been practical so long  --  that 's the key to all that 's gone wrong between us . Practical . How long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects ? How long since you said your own say ?  --  or made a good mistake ? We 've polished up our life , and , like the company silver , it looks well , but we never use it . There 's nothing left for me to come back to . And I 'm not coming back . BOULTING Where will you go ? Have you considered that ? What will you do ? SARA I do n't know . Somewhere  --  something . Is n't part of living finding out how ? BOULTING Be careful , Sara . Be sure you 're prepared to face the consequences  --  to us both . SARA I 've no choice , Reuben . ( She starts out ) BOULTING Sara , wait . ( She stops . There is a pause ) BOULTING We ca n't put all our time behind us . Please repay my patience . SARA With what ? What have I got that you want ? BOULTING Yourself , Sara . If you want me to say it I will . I need you . There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . p. 107 SARA It is n't so . You do n't need me at all . You need someone called " wife " to do the right thing at the right time and never what might be considered the wrong . Reuben , we 're not friends any more . You could find a far more efficient partner through a want ad . BOULTING I think that when you have cooled , Sara , you 'll see that your place is here . You 'll come back and you 'll be welcome . I want you to know that now . You 're a remarkable girl , Sara . Always have been . But even you must know that it 's only in Heaven that we can grow younger . SARA Yes , but it 's only down here that we can stay alive . I know how awkward this may be , but if I stayed , it would be even more so . BOULTING Sara , wait . Do n't do this . The world will judge you an extremely foolish woman . SARA Well  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known to change its mind . ( She goes . BOULTING , numbed by his sudden trouble , moves to the desk and sits . MRS . WIDMAYER comes in munching a piece of sponge-cake . She looks at the tea tray ) MRS . WIDMAYER Where 's Sara ? BOULTING I do n't know . MRS . WIDMAYER Want me to get her ? p. 108 BOULTING No , thank you . ( MRS . WIDMAYER sits in a chair near the center lamp , adjusts her glasses and opens her book . She tries to find the best reading position , while she complains querulously ) MRS . WIDMAYER Why do n't you get some stronger light bulbs ? Or get me some stronger eyes ? Least you could do . BOULTING ( Absently ) Yes . ( She reads in silence for a few moments . Then she snorts ) MRS . WIDMAYER Worst damn book I ever read . No sense to it . If I was n't more than half way through it , I would n't even finish it . ( Another pause ) BOULTING @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mm-hm ? BOULTING You have to leave tomorrow ? MRS . WIDMAYER Want to . ( She turns a page and continues reading ) BOULTING I wish you 'd stay . MRS . WIDMAYER Why ? BOULTING I 'm in trouble . It 's Sara . She 's being  --  She 's rash . I just do n't know . She 's leaving me. p. 109 MRS . WIDMAYER ( Looking up ) Why ? BOULTING Because she does n't approve of me , I suppose . MRS . WIDMAYER Fair enough reason . She 's just doing what most women feel like doing , one time or another . When they get let down . ( He comes to her ) BOULTING I ca n't stop her , Ma . I tried . I said everything  --  did everything . MRS . WIDMAYER Well , she was n't easy to get in the first place , Reubie . She may be even harder to get back . But I never run into anybody who was better at getting what he wanted than you . I think that 's part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to go about it this time . ( He starts out , helplessly ) MRS . WIDMAYER Wait a second . ( He stops ) Let me start you off . ( She looks up at him ) You got a good big mirror upstairs ? BOULTING I suppose so . Yes , of course . MRS . WIDMAYER Well , first off , go on up there and sit down in front of it and look at yourself . Take a long look . Take a hell of a long look . Take an hour . And if you have n't got a mirror , use a blank wall . Then tomorrow do it again . Do it every day and maybe you 'll finally see what Sara sees ! And what 's wrong . p. 110 BOULTING All right . MRS . WIDMAYER I mean it , Reubie . Sounds silly , but who do you know looks at themselves enough ? ( Now , surprising her and himself , he is drawn to her . He bends to embrace her . She holds him close for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other and see beyond the faades . Finally , he goes out of the room and upstairs . She watches him ascend )
