The U.S. Army gave chemists a clue to the shattering power of blockbuster bombs dropped on Germany in the past few months . The clue is hexamine , one of the ingredients in the explosive with which blockbusters are packed for quick and shattering destruction . <P> Use of the new explosive was announced to newsmen last week at the award of an Army &; Navy " E " ' pennant to a Du Pont plant at Perth Amboy , N.J. , where hexamine is made . The other ingredients of the explosive are secret , but the Army described its properties : it explodes faster and more violently than TNT . Apparently it has been used so far only in bombs , for which it is ideal . <P> No new product , hexamine ( full name : hexamethylenetetramine ) has been recognized by chemists for years as having explosive possibilities . It is a white granular substance that looks and feels like sugar , is chemically compounded from ammonia gas and formaldehyde ( which in turn is produced from wood alcohol ) . <P> In making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn out the chemical in a special grade . The size of the granules had to be changed from earlier manufacture ; moisture content and other properties also had to be changed and closely governed in manufacture . <P> Du Pont 's process , now used in all hexamine plants , combines liquid formaldehyde and liquid ammonia to form hexamine by a secret method . The solution is then passed into an evaporator , where it is boiled down into crystalline form . This substance is dried , ground and shipped in powder form to explosives plants . Said a Du Pont worker : " We never see the finished product . But Hitler does-plenty . " <P> Unlike TNT , which calls for ammonia , sulfuric and nitric acids and toluene , hexamine requires no critical materials . Its basic raw ingredients are coke , air and water . Total production in U.S. in ' 1941 was 4,000,000 lb . New factories built since then have multiplied that output many times . But before war came , hexamine was a minor industrial product . Its chief uses then were in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antiseptic for the urinary tract.
