Flying weather was bad , but the young ex-sailor was enjoying the ride . His oxygen mask seemed to give him no trouble at all . But at 16,000 feet , he suddenly began to sweat and turned blue in the face . Rushed back to the field and thence to a hospital , he died within 28 hours . <P> The victim had not told the airline that he had been in a tubercular clinic and under treatment by pneumothorax ( collapsed lung ) . His death was due to a simple law of physics : as atmospheric pressure decreased , the air in his chest cavity expanded to a volume that swiftly caused fatal complications . <P> Reporting the case in the Journal of Aviation Medicine , Dr. Kenneth E. Dowd drew a moral for all such patients : stay on the ground ; but if you must fly , stay below 5,000 feet .
