" In this strange age it has been left to the American Unitarian Association to descend to a level of theological discussion never reached in our knowledge by the most obscurantist fundamentalist sect . . . . " Reinhold Niebuhr was counterattacking in force . <P> In a pamphlet , What Is This Neo-Orthodoxy ? ( TIME , May 6 ) , eleven Unitarian disbelievers ( in the deity of Christ and the sinfulness of man ) had lambasted Protestantism 's growing neo-orthodox movement with everything in the book . The Unitarian polemicists concentrated their attack on neo-orthodoxy 's belief in the Doctrine of Original Sin , indulging themselves in such five-fingered epithets as " totalitarian religion , " " ' Mother fixation ' upon an idealized past . " <P> In this week 's issue of his intellectual quarterly Christianity &; Society , neo-orthodoxy 's Reinhold Niebuhr uncorked a reply that minced no words . " The animus of the Unitarian attack , " he charged , " is primarily directed against the classical tradition of Christianity in any of its forms . " Then he went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two main theses-which , he said , revealed " the stupidity and the malice of the pamphlet . " <P> Realism &; Calvinism . " The one thesis , " wrote Niebuhr , " is directed against the Christian doctrine of the sinfulness of man . The argument runs roughly as follows : To believe in the sinfulness of man is to believe in total depravity . To believe in total depravity is to accustom men to evil . Every step in this logic is false . . . . <P> " One of the Unitarian writers thinks that a realistic view of human nature easily ' excuses personal and individual inaction as well as acquiescence in the idea of dictatorship . ' . . . Most of the continental resistance churches were informed by a dialectical theology . . . . It is stupid and malicious to deny the moral and religious heroism of continental Christianity in fighting the evils of Nazism . . . . " <P> The Unitarians ' second thesis , according to Niebuhr , ran as follows : " Modern orthodoxy is a revival of Calvinism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing anything about anything but in waiting upon God to save the world . " <P> " Every step in this logical process is also false , " wrote Niebuhr , and proceeded to an example : the Unitarians had accused both Msgr . Fulton J. Sheen and Niebuhr of being " futilitarian gadflies . " Said Niebuhr of himself and Sheen : " There is not only practically nothing in common between their thoughts , but both of them are very active in political causes , though the causes are more or less diametrically opposed . . . . " <P> Finally , " it would hardly seem possible to misinterpret the thought of opponents quite as grossly as this out of mere stupidity . Here we might turn to Calvin for an explanation and learn from him that most forms of human sinfulness are something more than stupidity and something less than malice . "
