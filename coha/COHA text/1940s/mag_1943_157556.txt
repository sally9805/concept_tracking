The story of a lethal genie that can live in a test tube for 20 years and , when uncorked , can kill again was told in Public Health Reports last week by Dr. Edward Francis . The genie is the bubonic-plague bacillus . <P> The particular bacillus used in Dr. Francis ' experiment was taken in 1923 from a sick California ground squirrel . It was used to inoculate 48 test tubes partly filled with beef infusion agar jelly . The tubes were tightly sealed to insure a moist atmosphere and stored at a temperature of 50 F. <P> That was all the coddling the bacillus rot , but that was enough . When 20 years were up last April , the bacteria in 33 of the tubes were very much alive . To find out whether the live germs were still killers , they were injected into 33 guinea pigs . Result : 22 guinea pigs got bubonic plague ; eleven did not .
