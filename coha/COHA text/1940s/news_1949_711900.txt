A smaller group of religious students will take over II grave-digging and other cemetery duties at Gate of Heaven Cemetery in Hawthorne , N. Y. The Cardinal announced this move at 6:30 last night after a breakdown in negotiations with a committee of Local 293 of - the United Cemetery Workers , CIO , which on Jan. 13 called a strike of 240 employes at Calvary Cemetery in Queens and followed it by calling out an Feb. 10 the forty-nine workers at the Gate of Heaven Cemetery in Hawthorne , N. Y. Alter his announcement the prelate went last night to St. Joseph 's Seminary near Yonkers , where he recruited the students for the priesthood in the " werk of mercy . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The strike of cemetery employes , who include gravediggers , gardeners , foundation workers and chauffeurs , left unburied as of yesterday morning 1,020 bodies at Calvary alone . About sixty bodies arrive at the cemetery daily . These coffins have been placed in a temporary burial area and covered with tarpaulins . At least another hundred burials have been deferred at the Gate of Heaven Cemetery . A deputy commissioner of the Department of Health , Matthew A. Byrne , yesterday urged Msgr . George C. Ehardt , managing director of Calvary , to take action on a situation that , if permitted to continue , might become a violation of the Sanitary Code . City law requires that the dead be buried within ten days except when special permission for a delay has been asked and granted . Such special permission has been granted a // by the Health Department to Calvary officials . Speaking with great feeling and declaring that nothing in his ten years in New York had caused him " more thought and pain , " Cardinal Spellman asserted that the strike was a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his decision , he said , at 5 P.

Cardinal Spellman has contended that the parent international is strongly Communistdominated . ? John Sheehan , an attorney representing the cemetery workers , said in. reply to the Cardinal 's statement that " there is no Communist personnel , policy or program within Local 293 or followed by it . " He described the Communist issue as a " red herring . " " The action of the Cardinal , in the opinion of the union , " Mr. Sheehan said , " is high-handed , arbitrary and suggestive of the tactics used by anti-union employers ten years ago . " The union attor= ney charged that the Cardinal , in appealing directly to the workers in several letters and a telegram , had sought " to break the union . " The dispute arose primarily over the union 's demand for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saturdays a .. d Other overtime . The weekly wage for a gravedigger is $59.40 , according to the union . Cardinal Spellman said last night that making the five-day week a main issue in the controvery was " a half-truth . " " The strikers themselves have told me that Saturday is the heaviest day in our cemeteries ; that there are more interments on Saturday than on any other day , and that , fin addition , the graves to be used on Monday must be opened on Saturday . They told me they wanted six days ' work for sevenand-one-half days ' pay and their agent demanded a new wage scale of $77.22 for a six-day week . " Had he submitted to union demands , the Cardinal said , and passed the " 30 per cent increase on to the families " he would not have been protecting " the rights of millions of Catholics . " Within " my very own circle of Catholic workers , " Cardinal Spellman said , " there are men who would permit themselves to be led into an unjustified and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , against their religion and human decency , and even against themselves and organized labor . " Godfrey Schmidt , an attorney for the trustees of St. Patrick 's Cathedral , who direct the cemeteries , said that an offer of an 8 per cent increase along with the " fringe " items brought the cemetery workers to " an equivalent compensation position " with every industry in the country except for five ; according to Bureau of Labor Statistics information . A* union spokesman said last night that on Monday Cardinal Spellman , addressing a meeting of 200 cemetery workers at his residence , - had asked them to go back to work as individuals , " to go back , the spokesman said , " without any ? nion . " Cardinal Spellman made it plain yesterday that he would be willing to deal with the employes again if they , became affiliated with another CIO parent group .
