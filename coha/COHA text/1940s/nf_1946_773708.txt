txt // necessary deductions from axioms and definitions . The latter , however , are merely relatively true , dependent upon the extent and type of conformity between what physical propositions purport to show about the physical world , and what the physical world actually is . Consequently , the proposition , " All bodies gravitate , " is true only to the extent to which it describes the actual behavior of bodies . It remains hypothetically or relatively true , however far-reaching the agreement between its descriptions of matters of fact and the matters of fact it describes . The modification of Newton 's knowledge by twentieth-century physicists is an example of the relative truth of his knowledge . ) KNOWLEDGE AND PERCEPTION We must now leave the propositions of mathematics and physics and turn to another type of knowledge . Consider the example : I know that the wind is whistling through the green leaves of that oak tree . Unlike both of the previously considered cases of knowledge , the known object here is perhaps a given perceived object or perhaps a sense-datum . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; a proposition in physics refers to the physical world in general , that is , to all objects in the physical world . My knowledge of the wind 's sound , however , is grounded upon a specific sense-perception at this moment . Whereas no human physicist or even a group of organized physicists will ever undertake the dreary task of observing every post Whether any propositions of physics are absolutely true or not is an issue which can not be treated here . It is sufficient to note that many of them are merely relatively certain . // sible physical object with the superfluous purpose of trying to discover whether each and every one of them can be observed to be gravitating , I , a given knowing mind , have ( in relation to the tree ) a type of knowledge which is based upon a single , direct perceptual effort . The epistemological object here is identical with the physical object ( tree , leaves , wind ) . I know directly the external world . Here seems to be a type of knowledge which will lend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our study . KNOWLEDGE AND SELF-KNOWLEDGE In each of the three examples of knowledge thus far mentioned , the object of knowledge is numerically distinct from the self which does the knowing . The sentence in arithmetic must be a part of my experience if it is to be known by me ; but it is not a part of my knowing self . The external physical world includes my body , and therefore in a certain sense it includes myself ; but in knowing Newton 's law , I am not knowing myself . The wind whistling through the trees is quite different from the self that hears it , whatever may be the nature of the bridge which the physiology and psychology of audition tell us connects them . Unlike all these examples , let us consider another case of knowledge . I know that I am talking thoughtfully with a friend . There is a curious tendency among students of theory of knowledge to assume that the " objects " of knowledge are always inanimate objects , like desks , trees , and the wind . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking with a friend is the object of my // knowledge . My thought , my talk , my friend 's thought , and my friend 's talk are , all of them , phases of the object known . I , as a knower , have as a part of my object of knowledge my own thought , my own mental processes , and the words in which these issue . The fact that I am thinking and talking is in every way similar as an object of knowledge to the three previously considered objects . What I am is a problem quite parallel to the question of what an arithmetical sum is , or what a gravitating planet is , or what a whistling wind is . The fact that I am a person who , among other things , thinks and talks is as indubitably known as the truths of arithmetic , general physics , and sense-perception . The content of my knowledge in each case rests upon what the known object signifies . In the case of my conversation with my friend , the given object of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thinking and talking with another person who is doing the same . Selfknowledge is as genuine a type of knowing as arithmetic , physics , or sense-perception . CONFLICTING THEORIES OF KNOWING : RATIONALISM Broadly speaking , there are two major conflicts among philosophers concerning the nature and limiting conditions of knowledge . These conflicts may be labeled : ( 1 ) the rationalistic or nonempirical theories of knowledge versus the empirical or experiential theories of knowledge versus the pragmatic theories of knowledge . This conflict concerns the nature of the relation between knowledge and truth or true ideas . // ( 2 ) Among empiricists , the subjectivistic theories of empirical knowledge versus the realistic theories of empirical knowledge . The first of these conflicts we shall treat in this chapter ; the second , in the next chapter . The rationalistic theory of knowledge holds that all genuine knowledge is something like knowing two plus three to be equal to five . The empirical theory of knowledge holds that all genuine knowledge is something like my perceptual knowledge that the wind is whistling through the leaves of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nature of the act or process of knowing . On the other hand , the conflict among the empiricists concerns the nature of the object known , the object which ? they all agree ? is given in and through sense-perception . The theory of knowledge of Rene Descartes ( 1596 ? 1650 ) is a famous example of rationalism . Descartes began his philosophizing by accepting the common-sense point of view that some truths ( for example , mathematical sentences ) are based entirely upon the human reasoning process , while others are found in senseperception . He proceeded to submit both of these types of truth to a kind of critical examination which he called " motivated doubt . " In fact , however , the result was to call into question the second type , and to reaffirm the first type as the only genuine kind of knowledge . Mathematical truths are nonempirical , not in the sense that they lie in our minds prior to all senseperception , but rather because they are found in the mind , and are discovered to carry with them a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the // data of sense-perception . Two plus three would equal five even if we had no certain knowledge about the na-ture of a physical world lying outside our minds . hu-man knowing selves are equipped with " innate " ideas consisting of the entire edifice of arithmetical , geomet-rical , and algebraic principles and propositions . No knowledge which is less " clear " than these principles is genuine . Any knowledge which is as clear as , or clearer than , these principles can not be doubted . The result of this hard and fast rationalistic or non-empirical standard of knowledge was to banish from the bar of knowledge all claimants save two : ( 1 ) a general science of physics , which would include every-thing which today passes as physics , chemistry , biology , and physiology , and whose principles would be entirely mechanistic , in a sense which must later be explained ; ( 2 ) an equally general science of psychology , which would include every phase of human mental life , all ideas , thoughts , feelings , acts of will , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Descartes , forthcom-ing in regard to extension and all its modes , and in re-gard to thought and all its modes . The two master sciences were to depend entirely upon a priori prin-ciples , and were to be entirely free of all the varying conditions of sense-perception . Descartes 's philosophic system , as well as those of his two successors , Spinoza and Leibniz , represents a metaphysics grounded en-tirely upon an a priori or rationalistic theory of knowl-edge . All these men held the very general " rationalistic faith " that the " inner " principles of reason provide an infallible clue to the " outer " nature of things . // EMPIRICISM On the other hand , the theory of knowledge of David Hume ( 1711-4776 ) is an equally famous example of empiricism . Hume began his philosophizing by contending that knowledge is based exclusively upon sense-perceptions . All perceptions are either impressions or ideas . Impressions are perceptions which enter the mind with most force and violence , and include sensations , passions , and emotions . Ideas are faint images or copies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Knowing is nothing more or less than a manner of associating impressions and ideas according to the principles of resemblance , contiguity in place or time , and cause and effect , while these three principles in turn rest upon experience and habit or custom . In Hume 's earlier writing , A Treatise of Human Nature , he even placed the principles of mathematics upon an empirical basis , claiming that even the propositions in that science are derived from an empirical manner of dealing with impressions and ideas . The result of these contentions is that all knowledge is of relative validity , limited to the extent of the uniformities which human beings perceive among their impressions and ideas , and never carrying universality of reference to all objects in the world . In the final analysis , the truth of arithmetical propositions and of laws in physics is of the same kind as the truth of the statement that the wind is now blowing through this tree . Just as I do not know that the wind will be blowing tomorrow , so likewise I am not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plus three equals five . Hume was unable in his later book , // An Inquiry Concerning Human Understanding , to retain this entirely empirical conception of mathematics , but he continued to consider the truths of physics to be derived from experience , and therefore to be only relative in their validity . PRAGMATISM The rationalists and the empiricists make one common assumption , namely , that truth and knowledge are different . Let us illustrate . In 1686 Newton discovered and proclaimed his laws of gravitation . He gained knowledge . Now the problem arises , had these laws been true before.Newton came to know them ? In other words , did the suns and planets and bodies on the surface of the earth " obey " these laws even before the laws had been formulated by the great physicist ? Were these laws true before 1686 and did they merely become known at that time , or did the laws become true only in the process of becoming known by Newton ? Now the rationalists and the empiricists , while disagreeing about the mode of discovery of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once discovered , would agree that the truth of these laws is different from the process of knowing them .. The rationalist holds that a kind of inner , logical consistency or " coherence " determines the truth of these laws ; the empiricist holds that a kind of observed conformity or " correspondence " between the laws and the facts determines the truth of the former . In a word , rationalism rests , in general , upon what is called the coherence theory of truth ; while empiricism proclaims the correKNOWLEDGE // spondence theory of truth . Yet neither school equates truth with knowledge . Newton 's laws were true before they became known . In opposition to both of these theories of truth , the pragmatists contend that truth is nothing more than the process of verification of an idea . The act of know-ing creates and embodies the nature of truth . Protag-oras ( 481 ? 411 B.C. ) held that man is the measure of all things . This idea is sometimes interpreted as em-bodying the central idea of pragmatism . Kant ( 1724 ? 1804 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but in his account of ethical truth he clearly enunciated the idea that truth is identical with the proc-ess of confirmation in experience . In recent times three men gave powerful expression to the pragmatic the-ory of truth  --  Charles Peirce , William James , and John Dewey . Truth , according to these men , is identical with the satisfactory working of an idea . The verity of an idea is identical with its verification . Truth is neither the inner coherence of ideas according to fixed rational-istic principles , nor is it the conformity of ideas to sets of external , observable facts . Truth is nothing more than the process of knowing as it works itself out suc-cessfully in various theoretical and practical human enterprises . The truth of Newton 's laws of physics is identical with the processes by which they have been verified . Before these processes were worked out in 1686 , these laws were not true . Pragmatists fail to consider the total knowing situ-ation . They confuse the act or process of knowing with the nature or significance of what is known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly discoverable // criterion for the truth of an idea other than the process of successful verification in practice . But in genuine knowledge , the criteria of truth are not identical with the successful penetration of the mind to an apprehension of these criteria . The truth of Newton 's laws of gravitation is determined by the inner consistency of those laws ( coherence theory of truth ) plus the external conformity of those laws to the observable facts ( correspondence theory of truth ) . In the quest for knowledge , the criteria of the rationalist must be combined with those of the empiricist . The pragmatist mistakenly rejects both . Consider the proposition , " The moon has a back side . " Now the moon keeps the same side toward the earth at all times . Is it true or false to say that it has no other side ? Let us assume that human beings will never be able to perceive the other side . By means of direct observation , the existence of the other side is unverifiable ? that is , neither actually nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet the existence of the other side is a fact . There is a conformity between the idea embodied in the statement about the back side of the moon and the conditions in space on the actual moon . It is this conformity or correspondence which the pragmatist confuses with actual or potential verification by human beings . THE METHOD OF HYPOTHESIS In considering the differences between the theories of knowledge of the rationalists and the empiricists , Francis Bacon ( 1561 ? 1626 ) formulated a suggestive // analogy between these theories and the activities of certain small animals . Consider the activities of the spider , the ant , and the bee . The spider spins his web entirely from within . The web is the product of his own inner substance . The ant , on the other hand , in building a hill , merely collects materials from the outside , transfers them from one place to another , and piles them upon each other . The bee , however , is still different in his most typical procedure . He collects materials from the outside , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the bee transforms the materials according to his own nature , and the product is honey ? collected from the outside and transformed from within . His final product comes from within , as does that of the spider . But unlike the web of the spider , the original materials are gathered from the outside . Line the spider , the rationalist , according to Bacon , merely spins his theories from within with little or no recognition of the necessity of relating those ideas to external facts . His a priori , deductive procedure is completely barren or empty until it is related to the facts of nature as observed through the senses . The empiricist of the older school , Bacon held , like the ant , merely collects a host of irrelevant facts without seeking in any way to interpret them in the light of " inner " ideas . This purely a posteriori , inductive procedure is completely blind until it is clarified by means of ideas , axioms , and principles . The truly scientific method of knowing , called by Bacon the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bee . The knowing mind collects its materials from the outside by means of senseperception and experimentation ; but the mind then // transforms and orders these materials according to inner rational principles , or , in Bacon 's language , according to higher and lower axioms . Both senseperception and rational analysis are necessary . In the words of Immanuel Kant , conceptions without perceptions are empty , perceptions without conceptions are blind . The theory of knowledge which combines the procedures of the rationalist and the empiricist in the manner described by Bacon and Kant is called the hypothetical deductive method or the method of hypothesis . It begins , always , with observation and experimentation . In the light of past observations , a tentative hypothesis is formulated , designed to explain the phenomena under investigation . From this hypothesis , further deductions are made , which are then verified or disproved by further observation and experiments . This method is used by the various special sciences ? physics , biology , and the others ? and it is also the method of philosophy . An example of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field of astronomical physics is found in the manner in which Einstein worked out one of his theories of relativity . Before Einstein 's investigations , the Newtonian laws of physics accounted successfully for the behavior of all of the planets except one , namely , Mercury . The path which this planet followed was very slightly at variance with the predictions according to Newton 's laws . This fact was the source of a good deal of speculation by scientists . Einstein held ( 1 ) that if his hypothesis concerning relativity is true , the paths of all the other planets // could be calculated , and , in addition , the path of Mercury could be predicted to conform to a specific formula which he worked out . Einstein held ( 2 ) that if his hypothesis is true , another formula , which he worked out , would be found to describe the precise amount which a ray of light would be found to bend in its path , if observed during an eclipse of the sun . Einstein held ( 3 ) that if his general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked out , would be found to describe the amount which the bands of color are displaced toward the red on a spectrum if the ray of light comes from the sun . In a word , Einstein made three predictions ( deductions ) from his given hypothesis . Further experimentation and observation confirmed each of these predictions . The method of hypothesis is a highly complicated process . It depends upon the inner consistency of the ideas of the knowing mind , and also upon a discoverable conformity between those ideas and the facts of nature . But the facts of nature can be discovered only in and through observation . Observation , in turn , even when it includes elaborate experimentation , always rests upon a moment of sense-perception , a glance through a telescope , the glimpse of a pointer-reading , or merely the direct seeing or hearing or touching of the phenomenon in question . In every case , the method of hypothesis presupposes some theory of the nature and significance of the data of sense-perception . Before we can forge an instrument of knowing which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we must , therefore , consider the second // main issue in the field of theory of knowledge , the conflict between the subjectivists and the realists concerning the data of sense-perception as objects of knowledge . CHAPTER III Theories of Knowledge THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUBJECTIVISM Since the rationalists hold that there is a harmony or conformity between the " inner " principles of reason , and the " outer " nature of things , the objects known are for the rationalist , by definition , real and existent independent of the process of knowing . For the empiricist , however , the rather ticklish question arises as to the final or real nature of the data or impressions upon which all knowledge is grounded . Do the data of sensation exist in their own right , apart from the act of sensing as carried on by human minds , sense organs , nerves , muscles and the like ? The most famous line of philosophizing in which this problem is brought to the fore was developed in successive stages by the British philosophers , Locke , Berkeley , and Hume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the views of Descartes , stated the theory of representative perception . According to this theory , objects lying in the external physical world produce certain effects upon the sense organs of human beings which , in turn , set up physiological processes in the nerves and brain . These processes , in turn , cause ideas , representations , images , or copies to appear in the 33 // chamber of the human mind , where they are directly apprehended by the perceiving self . Now Locke was troubled by the fact that the objects transmitted only qualities to the sense organs . The green of a leaf was transmitted , assumedly , from the leaf to the human eye , but never the " substance " of the leaf . The result was that there never appeared in the mind any idea or representation or image of the leaf but only an image of its green quality . Hence Locke reduced the known nature of external objects to clusters of qualities cling-ing to an unknown X called the object . Nor did Locke stop here . The variability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noticed variabil-Figure ity depended upon some relation being established between the " outer " object and the chamber of the mind constrained Locke to define certain qualities as merely powers to produce effects upon the human perceiving mind . These qualities , which he called secondary , included color , taste , odor , sound , and touch . The result was to strip from the qualities really clustering about the X or unknown external object every feature except // size , shape , motion , rest , impenetrability , and extension , which Locke called the primary qualities . George Berkeley ( 1684 ? 1753 ) was quick to see the result of Locke 's assumptions and deductions . If external objects reduce to clusters of primary qualities clinging to an unknown X , if the machinery of senseperception generates the colors , odors , tastes , sounds , and tactual data , as mind-dependent conditions , a further stripping of the external object is inevitable . The same reasons for denying that the secondary qualities have any real status in an object when that object is unperceived require the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , motion , rest , and Figure the other primary qualities are entirely mind-dependent for the same reasons that the secondary qualities are linked with the perceiving process . The result is that the external object becomes reduced without remainder to an unknown X which in Berkeley 's opinion , is meaningless . To be is to be perceived , and the only things which are perceived are the ideas , representations , or images which make their appearance in the chamber // of human minds . The external world , including the physical processes of light and sound , and the physiological processes supposedly antecedent upon perception , is unreal and meaningless . This rather strange conclusion , Berkeley assures us , preserves untouched every feature of the external world in which the plain man has ever believed . The result of Berkeley 's philosophy is to reduce the external world to a private stage in the mind of the individual perceiver , with the perceiver as an audience of one . If the audience is inattentive , the play stops . There remained only one final deduction to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really is n't any audience watching this private drama in human minds . Impressions and ideas , all of them private to a human field of consciousness , are not at all indicative of a world outside the mind . Similarly , there is no perceiving self before whom the ideas and impressions pass and glide . The drama of human perception is being enacted on a private stage before an empty house . The doctrine of representative perception as stated by Descartes and Locke led on inevitably to the complete skepticism of David Hume . The subjectivistic theory of knowledge , with all its strange consequences , was the result of the attempt of philosophers to banish nonempirical , rationalistic knowledge and restrict their attention to the data of sense-experience . The attempt to make all knowing strictly empirical led first to the undermining of the nature of the " outer " objects and then to an equal degree of uncertainty concerning the nature of the " inner " life of the mind . // REALISM In opposition to this type of empirical theory , and also in contradistinction to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a different account of knowledge of the objects and data of sense-perception . Like all empiricists , realists deny any necessary conformity of the " inner " principles of reason to the " outer " nature of objects . Realism in general also begins with a denial of the doctrine of representative perception . ' The external physical world is not known by the mind in and through a realm of private images , ideas , or copies lying in a private chamber or field of consciousness . The human knower is in face-to-face contact with the external , physical universe . Beyond this common rejection of the principle of representative perception , modern realists differ among themselves concerning the nature of knowing . In 1903 , G. E. Moore , in England , distinguished between two aspects of sense-perception , namely , the act of sensing and the sensa or sense-data apprehended . According to him , the first of these is mind-conditioned : There is no sensing without a conscious , human perceiver on the receiving end of the process . On the other hand , Moore held , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather aspects of external physical objects which are given in their own persons to the perceiver in the process of knowing . In other words , my act of perceiving the green color of a leaf is different from the green sense quality which I perceive . The process of perception is dependent upon my mind ; the quality of 1 Locke 's semi-realism is ignored in this connection . // the object is independent of my perception . The leaf would continue to be green even if neither I nor anyone else were looking . When I see the leaf , a real aspect of its nature ( its green color ) becomes the terminus of my act of perceiving without any essential alteration thereby being effected in the nature of the leaf . The perceived green quality is not an idea or copy in my mind , but a quality of the object as it exists whether or not it stands in any relation to human consciousness . In Figure Caption Moore 's opinion , this presentative theory of perception offers assurance that both primary and secondary qualities are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , called new realism , runs into several difficulties : the problem of " tame " variations among sensedata , the problem of " wild " variations among sensedata , and the problem of error in general . In the first place , the outside world itself becomes a rather strange affair . The green quality of a leaf , for example , is perceived to vary under gradually increasing intensity of light from black at midnight on through dark green at early dawn , lighter green in the morning , and bright green at noon . The size of the perceived leaf varies from a mere dot in the distance to a very large object which covers my entire field of vision as I bring it close to my eye . A penny when seen at right angles is round , but as I turn it slowly to an oblique // angle , it assumes a series of elliptical shapes , and finally , when seen from the side , it is a thin rectangle . All these orderly or " tame " variations in leaves , pennies , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ features of external objects . In the second place , a realistic account of the nature of the objects of sense-perception runs into difficulties in accounting for disorderly or " wild " variations among the sense-data . A green leaf becomes yellow when drops of santonin are placed in the eyes of the perceiver . Furthermore , when the perceiver pushes one of his eyeballs slightly and tries to perceive , an object , he perceives two objects , one of them displaced a certain distance in space from the other . Again , a long straight stretch of asphalt roadway appears to be covered with water if viewed at an oblique angle on a hot day . Finally , a stick which is perceived to be straight when held in the air , is perceived as bent if placed partly in water and held at an angle . In each of these , and many other , examples , the sense qualities of objects vary in a disorderly or " wild " manner . Realism , in its purest form , would be forced to claim that each of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Likewise , realism faces the general difficulties bound up with the problem of error . In the story of the three blind men and the elephant , the first man touched the side of the elephant and announced that he perceived a wall . The second man felt the elephant 's leg , and said that he perceived a tree . The third man touched the snout , and contended that he felt a hose . How can a realistic theory of knowledge supply a criterion for // distinguishing between the erroneous beliefs of the three blind men , and the true knowledge of a person with sight ? How can realism account for tame and wild variations among sense-data , hallucinations , and mistaken beliefs ? In general , realists have split into two camps in their attempts to overcome these difficulties . The monistic realists , sometimes called neo-realists , have retained the general realistic emphasis upon the direct or immediate apprehension of objects in sense-perception . The dualistic realists have shifted the emphasis to the indirect process of signification or reference of the contents of the mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William James , the former type of knowing is knowledge by acquaintance , the latter is knowledge about or knowledge by description . NEO-REALISM R. B. Perry and others worked out the neo-realistic view in 1910 . All knowing reduces to immediate apprehension . Among the hosts of relations in which objects may stand to each other , there are two main types , physical and psychical . A green leaf is known in biology to possess many relations to other physical objects ? the sun , the soil , water , and the like . In this physical context , the green quality is physical , and in no way related to a perceiving human organism . On the other hand , the same green quality is transmitted by light to the eyes and optic nerves of a human being , and when perceived , it becomes psychical in nature . Is the green quality really physical or psychical ? The neo-realistic answer is that it is both . Like a chameleon which is at // one time brown and at another time green , the leaf is really neutral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also in psychical ones , with only the latter implying any relation to perception . The problem of error is accounted for by considering peculiar physiological and physical conditions which give rise to distorted perspectives ( like the bent stick ) , hallucinations , and illusions in the perceptions of a human organism , while accurate knowledge concerns those orderly physical and psychical relations in which the neutral entities are capable of standing , when abnormal or unusual perceptual conditions have been eliminated . In all knowing the epistemological object is given directly in its own person in perception , and is not merely a matter of indirect signification or reference by the mind to sets of objects not given . The other side of the moon is known by direct perceptual acquaintance or it is not known at all . DUALISTIC REALISM J. B. Pratt and others worked out the dualistic view in 1919 . The content of knowledge is always numerically different from the objects intended or referred to or signified . Sensa or sense-data and other contents of the mind must be supplemented by the active attribution of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not in one 's experience , before there can be knowledge . There is immediate acquaintance with sensa and other mental contents , but knowledge of external objects is always indirect , i.e. , knowledge about them . This view , in the opinion of its defenders , avoids the older " image " or " copy " theory of knowledge of Locke , as well as the // ensuing skepticism . Likewise it is designed to avoid the " almost incredible " part of monistic realism , " the theory of the direct apprehension of existents . " Dualistic realism is able , Mr. Pratt believes , to account for the nature of error as a kind of mistaken attribution of existence to the Figure Caption contents of knowing . According to this theory , the three blind men would perceive different types of sense-data , and infer mistakenly that they adhered to a hose or a tree or a wall , rather than to the elephant , while a man with sight is able to know the facts . A CRITICAL THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE : // An adequate theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerably more complex I // than any of the above theories has been willing to allow . In actual cases of perception , there is always more given to the mind than an isolated object or sensum . In fact , perception begins with a manifold of objects and relations with the sensa or sense-data as only one of its features . Let us illustrate . As I look from the window now , a panorama of grass , tree trunks , leaves , light and shadow , and open sky meets my gaze . As I listen , a choir of sound from insects and birds is broken by the occasional hum of human voices from the distance . If I let my vision dwell upon one leaf , I find that it is not perceived in isolation , but simply as one part of a visual field from which I can not shut out other leaves , branches , and other objects . Even if I ignore everything which is given to my eye at this moment except the single leaf , and even if I cease to perceive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it as a " patch " of green , there are two curiously different features of the " patch " : ( 1 ) the particular green quality which is the " content " of my perception , and ( 2 ) the shape and extension or " spreadout " quality of the green . This second feature is not a part of the visual datum in the same way that the green " patch " itself is . The " spread-out " feature of the green is a quality which the green shares with every other part of the visual field . In fact , it is impossible even in thought to detach the " spread-out " quality from the field , and think of nothing remaining . In brief , although I may imaginatively think of the green quality as absent , or as replaced by blue , black , or perhaps no color at all , I can not think of a piece of the quality of " being extended " as detached , for in the very process of imaginatively removing one spread-out datum or thing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being filled by something else equally spread out . In other words , the extensity of a datum is an aspect of its form and not of its content . The way in which the form of the sensum is apprehended is called intuiting , while the apprehending of the sense-datum itself is sensing . Both sensing and intuiting are direct or immediate ; in neither case is anything inferred . The intuited aspect of the leaf is called space , and it is this spatial character which fills the whole visual field from the outset , and which refuses to allow any part of itself to be detached , even in imagination . The extensity and spatial features of objects are intuited but not sensed . Similarly , if two sense-data ( green leaves ) are perceived as outside of each other , alongside each other , and respectively to the right and left of each other , all of these facts are immediately apprehended or intuited . These aspects of the two sense-data are , however , not sensed ; for only the contents of the data ( the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Similarly , if I apprehend a sense-datum ( green leaf ) as outside of me ? that is , as in a different place from myself ? the fact of this difference of place is immediately apprehended or intuited . This aspect of the datum ( leaf ) is not sensed , however ; for only the contents of the datum ( the green color ) are conveyed to me through my organs of sensation . Likewise , if two sensedata are perceived as simultaneous or successively given , this fact is immediately apprehended or intuited . These aspects of the datum ( leaf ) are not sensed , however , for only the contents of the datum ( the green color ) are conveyed through the organs of sensation . In // general , the extensity of a thing , the externality of one thing to another , the contiguity of one thing to another , the relation of one thing 's being to the right ( or left ) of another , the externality of a thing to the perceiver , the simultaneity of two things , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of objects are immediately given or intuited , yet none of them are sensed . The contents of sensation form only a very restricted part of the contents of intuition . By sensing alone , none of the abovementioned features of a physical object would ever be detected . Space and time at once determine the nature of the objects of perception ( including sensa ) , and prescribe the conditions under which human beings carry on the processes of intuiting and sensing . Space and time , therefore , bridge the gap between the subjective conditions of human knowing and the objective conditions of the existing world , and make possible the immediate , face-to-face apprehension of a physical object and its qualities . Space is the form in which all sense-data are spread out or extended . The green quality of a leaf is given to the perceiver as extended in space . Time is the form in which all sense objects persevere , change , and operate causally upon one another . The green quality of a leaf is given to the perceiver as the same ( or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Space is the form in which one sense-datum is external to and alongside of another . One green leaf is perceived to be outside of and alongside of another because they are perceived in a space which includes them both . Space is the form in which an object is perceived as outside of , and in a different place from , the perceiver . In order // that I may perceive a green leaf to be outside of , and in a different place from myself , both I and the leaf must be in space . Time is the form in which two objects are perceived as simultaneous or successive . In order that one green leaf may be perceived to be simultaneous with another , in order that one green leaf may be perceived as falling after another , time must be the form which includes both leaves . All these features of the physical world , as well as the manner in which these features are detected in knowledge by the human mind , are determined by the nature of space and time . Perceptual knowing is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensing and intuiting alone . In intuiting the spatial and temporal features of a visual field , neither space nor time is presented as having boundaries or edges or limits . Beyond any intuited part of space there appears inevitably a further part of space . At no part of space is it possible to discover an end . By its very nature space is intuited as extending on indefinitely . Therefore , in the very process of intuiting the given framework of a visual field , the mind is forced , by negation , to resort to a type of inference or knowing by description rather than by intuitive acquaintance . We are forced to notice that this space is not the whole of space . The idea of whole and part is presupposed in all intuiting . But neither the " part " nor the " whole " of space is directly intuited . The mediately apprehended features of intuitions are categories , and the part-whole relation is the most general categoreal relation of all . Categories are features of a visual field , which , though themselves not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of space and time , // that is , of the given intuited manifold . Just as all sensing involves and requires intuiting , so all intuiting involves and requires the use of the categories . This use is called categoreal thinking . Categoreal thinking is always in-direct or mediate , but it yields features of the manifold of perception . The final test of the genuineness of a category is , therefore , whether it describes features of Figure Caption space , time , and the sensa which are directly given . Intuiting without categoreal thinking is blind , categoreal thinking without intuiting is empty . Together , intuiting and categoreal thinking give direct knowledge of the physical universe . The categoreal relation of whole and part requires further specification . The whole of space ( or time ) includes all of the parts in it as integral segments of itself . The parts constitute the whole , which in turn pervades and displays itself in each part . All of the characteristics of space are found in any specific part . The only difference between " this " space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one is here , and the other there . The manner in which the whole of space is found in the parts is the prototype of the way that any " thing " is found in its parts . The category of substance is the category of " whole " in general discovered in parts of " things " in general , lust as the whole of space is intuitively given in its parts . The knowing mind discovers substances in the visual field , not because " things " are sensed ( only sensa are sensed ) but because the nature of the wider intuited manifold reveals intuited " parts " reflecting cohering wholes . The sensum green reveals no link to a substantial " thing " ; but the body of intuited relations in which the green sensum is inextricably embedded points to the whole " leaf " which is apprehended by categoreal thinking as an indispensable feature of the given . The category " substance " is an indispensable feature of the manifold of perception , and is a genuine feature of the physical world . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only its qualities . The categoreal relation of whole and part must also be made more specific in another fashion . The parts of time " flow " from each other with a type of necessity which can not be halted . The " necessary " continuity of time is indubitably given in intuition . I can not apprehend a " moment " of time which does not pass insensibly out of a previous " moment " and continue on into a later " moment . " Time is irreversible . Nor does time have gaps or breaks , for no segment of time can be imagined to be lifted out of itself . The same act of imagination which tries to think of a moment of time as removed from its relations to other moments is forced to fill the gap with another temporal segment . The continuity and // irreversibility of time require that categoreal thinking posit the idea of " part " flowing from and determined by " part . " Temporal sequence is no mere juxtaposition of independent fragments of time , but involves a necessary connection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner in which the " parts " of time depend upon each other is the prototype of the way that any " cause " is related to its " effect . " The category of causal efficacy or causation is the category of necessary relation between " part " and " part " of " things " or " events " in general , lust as the parts of time are intuitively given as standing in necessary connection with each other . The knowing mind discovers causal potency in the visual field , not because " necessary connection " is sensed ( only sensa are sensed ) but because the nature of the wider intuited manifold contains intuited temporal sequences reflecting wider cohering wholes . The sensum green reveals no causal links with other features in the career of a leaf , but the body of temporal relations in which the green sensum is inextricably embedded reveals causal " forces " which operate to link the present green with the past and with the future . The category " causality " is an indispensable feature of the manifold of perception , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can know the causal relations in the history of a green leaf , although I can only sense its qualities . Knowledge of the physical world is the progressive discovery of the spatial , temporal , substantial , and causal features of the given manifold of perception . Faulty perception , delusions , hallucinations , the examination of " wild " and " tame " variations among sensa , // and the problem of error in general are the result of an incomplete co-ordination of intuiting and of categoreal thinking with the intuitive and categoreal relations actually obtaining in the given manifold of sense . The most powerful tools for the correction of error are supplied by the world of space and time itself in the form of mathematical and logical analysis . The only phase of knowing which is conceptual and mediate is the use of categoreal thinking , and even this aspect of knowledge involves the discovery , in the field of intuition , of objective conditions which corroborate and justify the use of the categories . Categoreal thinking is never untrammeled imagining but always points back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of space and time , both in daily life and in mathematics , the knowing mind remains in face-to-face contact with the physical world , and merely orients itself in a more and more objective manner toward relations and qualities always presented to it . The application of this theory of knowledge to the wider problems of philosophy constitutes the next portion of our quest , the study of metaphysics . KNOWLEDGE AND REALITY The type of theory of knowledge which a philosopher espouses determines to a considerable degree the kind of reality which he is then able to claim that he knows . Rationalistic theories of knowledge often lead to the conviction that man and the universe are bound together in a harmonious whole , not unlike the structure of a piece of mathematical or logical reasoning . // Berkeley 's subjectivism led him to the conviction that an infinite perceiving Mind holds together the universe as the object of His perceptions . Hume 's skepticism in theory of knowledge is identical with a skeptical account of reality : Reality is composed only of masses of perceptions , impressions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or neo-realism , is constrained to reduce the human perceiving self to sets of neutral entities with psychical and physical aspects . Dualistic realism sometimes has as a major result the cutting off of the human mind or soul from the physical and physiological conditions which constitute the body . Similarly , the theory of categoreal realism in some measure foreshadows the metaphysical conclusions toward which our investigation is pointing . Certain theories of the nature of man and his place in the universe are ruled out by the adoption of the epistemological position which has just been traced . Certain other theories of reality , while not necessary outcomes of categoreal realism , at least remain tenable possibilities . Still other metaphysical conclusions seem to be inevitable results of adopting this epistemology . Before we turn to the study of metaphysics , let us sketch briefly some of the major consequences of the critical theory of knowing . The physical universe , whatever more specific features it may contain , is in a single unified space , and in a single time stream . The physical universe contains , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and both of these features operate in and through the wider spatial and temporal framework of nature . // The possibility of specific types of substances ? planets , suns , atoms , plants , animals , and minds ? is left quite indeterminate . The possibility remains open that a human self may know itself and other selves in the same way that it knows substances in general . The possibility of specific types of causal efficacy ? electromagnetic energy , mechanical force , metabolism , growth , adaptation , evolution , creativity , and consciousness ? is left quite indeterminate . The possibility remains open that a human self may know its own consciousness , and the consciousness of other selves , in the same way that it knows causal relations in general . The resulting picture of man and his place in the universe need not ? in fact , there is slight chance that it will ? represent a closed system with all principles clearly laid bare . In fact , as we shall see , nature is ultimately complex and mysterious rather than simple and clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complex of all realities . Yet all of the richness and multiplicity of types of existence , life , consciousness , and value must be considered to lie within , or rather emerge within , the universe of space and time in which the human knowing self emerges and gains knowledge . The categoreal theory of knowing prescribes , in widest outline , the conditions to which reality conforms : space , time , substance , and causation . This framework will turn out to be quite broad enough to include within itself the more significant features of reality which beckon us on . PART II The Ouest fo1 ? Reality CHAPTER IV The Categoreal Scheme : Mechanism THE " SIMPLICITY " OF NATURE Every- young child soon becomes acquainted with the difference between a task which is easy and one which is difficult . At the age of four , the task of putting on a shoe is easy ; but lacing the shoe remains very hard . As a child grows older , he is able to look back upon activities and skills which were first impossible for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy or even automatic . Since all human beings go through this experience , there arises quite naturally in the human mind the tendency to assume that for all problems there is ultirnately a " simple " and " easy " solution , at least for the skilled workman . This natural bias in favor of the simple type of solution receives support from the nature of most children 's experience of mathematics . In the lower schools , written exercises in arithmetic always have a right answer which is clear and easy for the student who grasps it . When this correct answer is not grasped , the fault lies always with the student , never with the problem itself . All business transactions rest upon the fact that mathematical computations can be right and simple . In man 's study of the various special sciences , his 53 // natural preference for the simple theory is elevated to the status of an operating principle called the law of parsimony . When each of two theories explains equally well all of the data under investigation , the simpler theory is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially in physics and chemistry , has accompanied the widespread success of the various sciences in describing natural processes , including the behavior of planets , suns , atoms , and chemical compounds . A leading instance of the application of the law of parsimony is found in Copernicus 's ( 1473 ? 1543 ) development of the heliocentric hypothesis to replace the older geocentric view of Ptolemy ( second century A.D. ) . Both theories had been carefully formulated in the light of known facts ; both involved the use of mathematics with great precision ; both had been tested by further observations and predictions ; and both accounted for all the known facts at the time . The only difference lay in the greater simplicity of Copernicus 's theory . His mathematical formulae , and the resulting " picture " of the heavens , were considerably less complex than those of Ptolemy . Only much later ( 1838 ) were telescopes strong enough to offer visual evidence that the earth had an annual motion about the sun . This motion was finally detected by noticing the apparent motion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen if the earth were actually moving . Even today a confirmed geocentric astronomer might defend the more complex theory , and maintain that the earth is at rest . The fact that he would be laughed out of court by the scientists indicates the prestige of the law of parsimony. // The task of that part of the quest for wisdom called metaphysics is the formulation of the most comprehensive and accurate account of the nature of man and his place in the universe . This task may be called the search for , or the investigation of , reality . The word " reality , " as here used , means nothing more or less than " the nature of man and his place in the universe , " and is not designed to convey any initial bias for or against any theory of the nature of man , for or against any account of the nature of the universe , or for or against any theory of the relation between the two . The law of simplicity is a bias , however fruitful it has turned out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must look upon the triumph of the simpler accounts of the nature of some aspects ( largely physical and chemical ) of the universe as carrying no more implication of a corresponding simplicity in other aspects or in the universe as a whole than data are forthcoming to confirm this idea . Similarly , the philosopher realizes that even if the universe as a whole were simple , displaying relatively clear and distinct patterns , this fact would be no final evidence that the nature of man is simple , or that man 's relation to the universe is a clear and easily ascertainable one . THE NATURE OF THE CATEGORIES In the quest for reality , the philosopher seeks , above all , to gain a clear perspective of his data . just as a painter focuses his attention upon the " subject " of his picture , places that subject in the position of central importance , and foreshortens everything else propor58 THE QUEST FOR REALITY tionately , so the student of metaphysics seeks to bring out the salient features of reality ? man and his place in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ features of reality in their proper setting . In one of Leonardo 's great pictures , the scene is laid under an outdoor shed where the Madonna sits holding the Christ child . Various wise men kneel about them in groupings that form a perfect pyramid with Mary 's head as the apex . Behind and beyond them the fields shade away in one of those inimitable Italian landscapes . The beginning student of metaphysics will do well to bear in mind the kind of finished product of which Leonardo 's painting is a great example : A clear theory of the nature of man and his place in the universe ought to sketch in an orderly way the structural features of this all-embracing subject . What man 's nature is must be sketched , as well as the types of relations which constitute his place in nature . Philosophers from Kanada in the Orient and Aristotle in Greece to Kant and Hegel in modern times have elaborated schemes of categories . By a " category " philosophers have meant different things , and the sets of categories have varied widely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the word " category " will he taken to mean a structural pattern or feature of reality , ( a ) discoverable in things as they are , and ( b ) possessing sufficient significance to justify its being singled out and used in the full account of metaphysics which the philosopher is seeking to formulate . The scheme of categories which will be investigated is ( a ) progressive and ( b ) overlapping . In other words , this study will begin with the most general basic strucTHE // tural feature of reality , and will proceed step by step through more and more specific categories until the most specific one is reached ; in this sense the scheme is progressive . Likewise , no single category is cast aside or " transcended " in proceeding to the next , but , rather , each basic structural feature of reality already " mapped out " or investigated continues to be " valid " alongside of each subsequent category that is examined . The situation is something like a certain kind of children 's toy blocks , which fit into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contains all the smaller ones , the next largest contains all except the largest , and so on ? the smallest block being in the very center of all the others . Similarly , the most general category includes all of the more specific ones , the next most general contains all of the others except the most general , and so on , until the most specific category reveals the very heart of reality , surrounded by , and grading off into , the more general features of nature . The categories which will be investigated are : ( 1 ) mechanism ( space , time , mass , and physical energy ) ; ( 2 ) natural teleology and evolution ; ( 3 ) creativity ; ( 4 ) consciousness and self-consciousness . These categories , in the order listed , range from the most general features of nature , exhibiting characteristics of the widest number of possible realms of the universe , to the most specific and specialized characteristic of man . The manner in which the categories " fit into " or are related to each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What is the nature of man and his place in the universe ? Thus , mechanism ( space , time , mass , and energy ) is a characteristic of the physical // universe , including inorganic matter , plants , animals , and man . Adaptation and purposiveness or natural teleology is a characteristic of all life . Evolution is a pattern of change , found in all living things . Creativity is the most general characteristic of man . Consciousness and self-consciousness , with the practical corollary of the power of acts of free will , are the most specific and intrinsic features of man , lifting him in a large measure , but not totally , beyond the organic and mechanical conditions which he shares with other features of reality . The aim of this and the immediately ensuing chapters is to examine these categories more thoroughly . In the present chapter the nature of mechanism must be investigated . THE RISE OF THE CONCEPT OF MECHANISM IN METAPHYSICS : DEMOCRITUS The ancient Greek atomism of Leucippus ( ca. 500-ca. 450 B.C. ) and Democritus ( born ca. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . According to that doctrine , the universe is composed of an infinite number of minute particles or atoms moving in a gigantic void . All of these atoms are of one type of material . Each of them is homogeneous throughout its entire inner structure . Each of them is indivisible , uncreated ( that is , it never came into being ) , and indestructible . The only way in which atoms differ internally among themselves is in size and shape ? both of which features are capable of measurement , i.e. , of being stated in quantitative terms . Everything in the universe consists intrinsically of atoms . The larger objects of senseTHE // perception , with all their variety of qualities , are simply compounds of atoms . The nature of the compounds is determined by the sizes and shapes of the atoms composing them , and by the positions of these atoms relative to each other in the void . Thus denser compounds are formed by atoms coming closer together in the void ; while rarer compounds are formed from the denser types by the constituent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differences in various things in the universe are accounted for , therefore , by the sizes , shapes , and positions of the atoms comprising those things . Nor did Democritus exempt the human soul from these conclusions . A human being , like everything else , is formed by atoms of certain kinds taking certain positions in the void . One of the most striking features of this metaphysical theory is the idea of the complete measurability of everything . Given four basic elements or categories , everything in reality is entirely explicable in those terms . These four basic elements ? the void ( space ) , size , shape , and position ? are , all of them , capable of expression in mathematical ( quantitative ) terms . Therefore , in a sense Democritus may be said to have formulated the more general notion of the complete orderliness of nature . Another important aspect of the theory lies in the corollary of the complete predictability of any future event in nature in the light of the quantitative conditions of a past event . This idea is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A is analyzed into its constituent elements , the already observed nature of those elements will make possible the prediction ( computation ahead of time ) of a succeed62 THE QUEST FOR REALITY ing event B. In Democritus 's theory , the computation of any event A will consist of the notation of the size , shape , position , and motion of the constituent atoms . Given this complete picture , the ensuing event B will be predictable in the sense that a new configuration of the atoms , as well as their sizes and shapes , is entirely determinable ahead of time from the known facts concerning A. In other words , contingency is entirely ruled out of nature : there is an unbreakable chain of causal law . A corollary of this theory is the complete determinability of human thoughts and conduct , ahead of time , by means of the observed conditions of the atoms composing a given human soul . Any " freedom " of human choice becomes a myth . MODERN MECHANISM : THOMAS HOBBES The successes of modern terrestrial and astronomical physics in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metaphysics . Both in the computation of the paths of the suns and planets , and in the formulation of the laws of motion of bodies on the surface of the earth , the faith of Democritus in an ultimately quantitative basis for the events of nature received powerful confirmation . Galileo ( 1564-1641 ) , in formulating the methods of modern physics , explicitly " reduced " nature to those features ? space , time , motion , rest , and impenetrability ? which lend themselves to measurement . The other qualities of nature , however important they remain in the speculations of the philosopher and theologian , may be safely ignored by the student of mechanics . Indeed , all scientific progTHE // ress comes from assuming the otiosity of colors , sounds , tastes , odors , and textures in the physicist 's picture of the universe . A rough , grey stone falling through the atmosphere to the surface of the earth becomes reduced by the physicist to a mass , centering in a point which moves through empty space in an observable time . This working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? 1679 ) to a metaphysical doctrine . In his opinion , the physical universe , including plants , animals , and men , consists entirely of matter in motion . If we imagine to fall from a window ( a ) a stone , ( b ) an uprooted sunflower , ( c ) a cat , and ( d ) a man , all these objects do essentially the same sort of thing in falling . They are masses of matter moving quite predictably . The fact that the cat may kick a good deal during his flight , the fact that the man may think a good deal while descending , adds nothing essentially novel to the picture . Even when plants exhibit the processes of nutrition , growth , adaptation , and reproduction , actually there are merely rather subtle types of matter in motion . In animal behavior there are two sub-species of motion . " Vital " motions include the " mechanical " processes of nutrition , digestion , the motion of the blood , and of the lungs . " Animal " motions include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limbs in a manner first fancied by the mind . This fancying by the mind is itself merely the remainder of past sensible motions . The small beginnings of all animal motions are called endeavor . " This Endeavour , when it is toward something which causes it , is called appetite , or desire . . . . And when the Endeavour is fromward something , it is generally called aversion .... " But all appe64 THE QUEST FOR REALITY tites and aversions are essentially nothing but matter in motion , and entirely explicable in terms of its simpler material components . Even human mental life consists entirely of mechanical appetites and aversions ? motions toward and away from objects . Just as the main force of an army sends forth small groups of scouts to bring back reports prior to a general advance or retreat , so large " macroscopic " appetites or aversions are at times preceded by small " microscopic " motions toward or away from objects . These minute appetitive and aversional motions are called thoughts , and a chain of them is called deliberation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a dinner party is offered another glass of fine sherry wine . We may imagine the following succession of " thoughts " to constitute deliberation on his part . Minute appetite or microscopic motion toward the wine : I am very fond of sherry . Minute aversion or microscopic motion away from the wine : I need a very clear head tomorrow morning . Second minute aversion : I must drive an automobile after the dinner . Second minute appetite : The hostess is quite pressing in her offer . Third ( and let us say , decisive ) appetite : To refuse would be impolite . This entire " chain " of " thoughts " Hobbes would say constitutes deliberation , but the whole process is merely matter in quite " microscopic " motion . According to Hobbes , if , as in the example , the last link in the chain of tiny appetites and aversions is an appetite , then that last link is labeled " will , " and it is the signal for the gross " macroscopic " motion of taking the wine . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been an aversional thought , it would be labeled " unwillingness " and would // be followed by equally overt withdrawal , the rejection of the wine . In both cases , however , the " choice " is entirely automatic , entirely the product of which " report " the last " thought " happens to bring . Consequently , all thinking and willing , all imagination and fancy reduce to appetites and aversions , which in turn are nothing but " animal " motion , which in turn is a specific type of matter in mechanical motion . MECHANISM IN MODERN PSYCHOLOGY : BEHAVIORISM The behaviorists , a group of modern , chiefly American , psychologists , have clothed the views of Hobbes in modern apparel . Although they adopt the term " organism " as descriptive of all animals from white rats to men , their account of organic behavior is essentially identical with a mechanical picture . All human behavior is the result of the establishment of various neural paths . These paths are entirely determined by the nature of the nerve structures , and the types @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a kind of reflex arc passing automatically from stimulus to response . Past responses , however , leave traces upon the nervous structure of an organism , with the result that future behavior becomes " conditioned , " i.e. , no longer is the response entirely the automatic result of a present stimulus , but partly a matter of which nerve paths have already become established as the outcome of past behavior . All behavior is , consequently , an integration of present , unconditioned response to present stimuli , and present , conditioned responses , determined partly by the past . The total result , the behaviorists assure us , is // and remains quite as automatic and predictable as the simplest jerk of a muscle . In general , Hobbes 's " objects " become " stimuli " ; his " appetites " become " adiences " or motions toward stimuli , which tend to increase the amount of the latter ; his " aversions " become " abiences " or motions away from stimuli , which tend to decrease the amount of the latter . Thought and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the words of Dr. E. B. Holt : " So . . . in the last analysis all the activities of an organism , including the highest mental achievements , arc reflex ; and , as is well known , if the eliciting circumstances ( stimuli ) are repeated the activities become habitual . " All knowing , discrimination , evaluation , and choice are put on a par with the simplest physiological " responses . " Once more , all human activities , and a fortiori the behavior of plants and animals , are entirely mechanical . THE PATTERN OF THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE : STARS AND ATOMS From the point of view of ordinary human experience , the earth seems to be enormous in size , and spread out indefinitely in all directions from the point upon its surface at which a person stands . The sun and the stars , on the other hand , appear to be small objects ranging from the size of a pin-point to that of a saucer . Only by reflection is it possible to correct this picture . When we understand even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there are three different spatial patterns which the universe em- - braces : ( 1 ) the solar system ; ( 2 ) the galaxy or nebula // in which the solar system lies ; and ( 3 ) exterior galaxies , lying beyond the one which contains the solar system . ( 1 ) the solar system includes the sun and eight satellites called planets which move around the sun in orbits . If the sun were a ball nine feet in diameter , the earth would be about the size of an apple ; and the two would be several hundred yards away from each other . On this scale , the moon ( a satellite of the earth ) would be about the size of a green pea and would be about a foot away from the apple ( earth ) . The other planets ? satellites of the sun ? vary in size , some being larger than the earth , others smaller ; some of them are closer to the sun than the earth , and have smaller orbits than the earth does ; while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have larger orbits . ( 2 ) But the total solar system is extremely small in comparison with the galaxy or nebula in which it lies . On a starry night the densest masses of stars seem to lie in one direction in the heavens . These masses are naively referred to as the " Milky Way , " and they appear to lie in one direction above and beyond the earth . As a matter of fact , the thousands of stars ( suns ) which comprise the galaxy in which the solar system lies are scattered all around the solar system . The only reason these stars seem to be massed in one direction is that the solar system is nearer some edges of the galaxy than it is to others , and consequently when we look toward the " Milky Way " we are merely looking out toward the thickest part of the galaxy , while if we look toward the " empty " parts of the sky , we are merely looking at what even a small telescope will show us to be thinner groupings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE QUEST FOR REALITY pared to a flattened , elongated haystack , very loosely packed , the solar system would correspond to a few small wisps of hay nearer the outside of the haystack on one side . If we creep into the haystack to the position of those few small wisps , we would look through less hay , in gazing outward on one side , than if we tried to gaze through the center outward toward the other side . ( 3 ) But the galaxy or nebula in which our solar system lies is only one among countless other galaxies or nebulae lying across gigantic distances of space outside our nebula . These distances are so great as to defy imagination , and the exterior galaxies are apparently as large as our own , and they probably contain as many thousands of stars ( suns ) as our own galaxy contains . When the stellar universe is contemplated in these spatial patterns , the conclusion is inescapable that the earth is an extremely small planet inside an extremely small solar system buried deep in the middle of merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , we turn our attention to various extremely small particles of matter on the earth 's surface , the results are equally divergent from the conclusions of common sense . Ordinary human experience tells us that mosquitoes , specks of dust , and particles of sand are extremely small in comparison with the size of our bodies , our houses , and our mountain ranges . Prying beneath the surface of the objects of senseexperience , physical and chemical science shows a very different picture , again with three perspectives . ( 1 ) Ordinary physical objects are composed of molecules , thousands of which are required to comprise even the // smallest object of sense . ( 2 ) Molecules are composed almost entirely of empty space , the rest being occupied by a number of particles of matter ( or energy ) which are much smaller than the molecules . If a molecule of water is compared with the size of a cathedral , all of the cathedral would have to be thought of as empty with the exception of one little corner containing three little footballs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to three little atoms , two of them being hydrogen , and the third oxygen . ( 3 ) But atoms themselves are known to be composed almost entirely of empty space , the rest being occupied by various particles of energy which are much smaller than the atoms . If one of the hydrogen atoms in a molecule of water is compared with a medium-sized church building , all of the building would be empty with the exception of a large green pea in the center and a few smaller peas whirling around the interior walls . The larger pea in the center would correspond , in an atom , to a positive charge of energy called a proton , while the smaller peas whirling around it would correspond to negative charges of energy called electrons . Out of various configurations of electrons and protons inside of atoms , all of the ninety-two chemical elements are formed . Out of various configurations of atoms in molecules , every chemical compound on the surface of the earth , or even anywhere else in the universe , is formed . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spatial patterns , the conclusion is inescapable that the earth is a gigantic physical mass including within every physical object on its surface extremely small particles called molecules within which // there are even smaller particles called atoms , which are in turn composed of extremely small charges of electrical energy , electrons and protons . Both the stellar and the atomic aspects of the universe reveal the presence of a preponderant amount of empty space , absolutely empty in comparison either to the " filled " space occupied by a particle of energy , or to an apparently even more " filled " space occupied by material compounds . THE PROPERTIES OF SPACE All knowledge of the world of the objects of senseperception , of the world of astronomy , and of the world of atomic physics , is derived by inference from an antecedently apprehended intuitive space . The validity of any inference about objects of sense-perception , solar systems , or atoms , rests upon the ability of the scientist to refer his findings back to the immediately intuited objects of sense-perception . Therefore , the properties of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more directly and simply given properties of intuitive space . In other words , all mathematical spaces are refinements or corrections of the nature of intuitive space . Intuitive space has the following properties : ( 1 ) It is a unified whole containing " parts " only as integral segments of itself ; it is not constructed out of independent , detachable fragments . ( 2 ) All of the more specific properties of intuitive space are displayed in any " part " of the whole . ( 3 ) Intuitive space is continuous : Between any two specific " parts " of space , there always // intervenes a third " part . " ( 4 ) Intuitive space is physically indivisible , but mathematically it is divisible infinitely or indefinitely . ( 5 ) Intuitive space is infinitely or indefinitely extended ; that is , beyond any finite limit there is always more space . ( 6 ) Intuitive space is threedimensional . Every " part " of it is intuited as possessing length , breadth , and thickness . ( 7 ) Viewed in relation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end . ( 8 ) Viewed as abstracted from time , intuited space is timeless , no " part " of it is earlier or later than itself , or earlier or later than any other " part . " ( 9 ) There is only one space which possesses all of the previously listed properties , and these properties are necessary ones , displayed throughout the whole of space all the time . The general characteristics of intuitive space , if carried over and applied to the spaces of galaxies and of atoms , yield important results . There is one infinite space in which all of the galaxies lie . If these galaxies are extended infinitely or indefinitely in all three dimensions of space , there is no space beyond the universe , for the universe itself is without end . If , however , these galaxies extend only a certain distance in space , then there is an infinite or indefinite amount of space beyond the galaxies . If the galaxies have been projected about a billion years ago from some central mass , and are proceeding outward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Similarly , every atom and molecule contain within themselves , and themselves move within , the one space . If electrons and protons are the ultimate units of matter and energy , these units contain within themselves even smaller " segments " of // space . If , however , electrons and protons are themselves compounds of some still more basic unit of energy , this other unit contains within itself still smaller " segments " of space . Mathematical or abstract division of space may proceed without end ; the one real space is nowhere physically divisible . SPACE AND TIME : MATHEMATICAL SPACES Mathematicians have treated the three dimensions of space as arbitrary qualities , and have postulated spaces with more than three dimensions . These mathematical spaces are incapable of being apprehended intuitively . Theoretically , equations may be constructed which represent a space with any given number of dimensions . If time is considered to be linked with threedimensional space , a sort of four-dimensional spacetime results . This conception , however , is very different from a four-dimensional space , which remains a mere abstract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of modern physics is a different conception from the space and time of ordinary experience . In daily life , time is intuited as possessing the following properties : ( 1 ) It is a unified whole containing " parts " only as integral segments of itself ; it is not constructed out of independent , detachable fragments . ( 2 ) All the specific properties of intuitive time are displayed in any " part " of the whole . ( 3 ) Intuitive time is continuous : One " part " flows imperceptibly into another , so that between any two " parts " a third intervenes . ( 4 ) Intuitive time is physically inTHE // divisible , but mathematically it is divisible infinitely or indefinitely . ( 5 ) Intuitive time is infinitely or indefinitely extended , both from the past , and into the future ; that is , beyond any finite limit of time , past or future , there is always a further time , past or future respectively . ( 6 ) Intuitive time is one-dimensional . Every " part " of it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 7 ) Viewed in relation to space , intuitive time is all-embracing : Each " part " of the one infinite space hangs upon the same instant or " part " of time as does every other " part " of space . ( 8 ) Viewed as abstracted from space , intuited time is eternal : It includes the possibility of " parts " of time before or after the existence of any space or thing in space . ( 9 ) There is only one time which possesses all the previously listed properties , and these properties are necessary ones , displayed throughout the whole of time . Space-time is a conception used by the physicists to indicate the necessary relatedness of particular times and particular spaces . If the " parts " of time depend upon the order of objects in time , and if the " parts " of space depend upon the order of objects in space , the " parts " of space and time are inextricably bound up with each other . The spatial position of objects always implies some temporal relation ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The theory of the relativity of space to time means that there are various different streams of time , and that the spatial position of objects is always relative to one rather than another of these time series . But all specific temporal series are merely abstractions ( however serviceable ) from the one all-embracing intuitive time . // Therefore , the relativity of spatial positions to a timeseries indicates merely the absence of knowledge concerning the relations of those positions to real , intuitive time . Similarly , the theory of the relativity of time to space means that there are various , different frames of space ( perhaps three-dimensional , perhaps hyperbolic , perhaps elliptical ) , and that the temporal position of objects is always relative to one rather than to another of these space-frames . Thus two instants which are simultaneous with reference to one space-frame are allegedly successive with reference to another . But all specific space-frames ( three-dimensional , elliptical , or hyperbolic ) are merely abstractions ( however serviceable ) from the one all-embracing intuitive space . Therefore , the relativity of temporal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerning the relations of those instants to real , intuitive space . In other words , space and time , however related , in the last analysis , to each other , are two different categories of the universe . The concepts of mass , matter , and substance are based upon , and have as their prototype , space . The concepts of energy and causality are based upon , and have as their prototype , time . ENERGY AND MATTER : THE MECHANICAL PATTERN OF NATURE Just as infinite space is almost completely devoid of matter and energy , even taking into account the gigantic amounts of matter and energy in objects ranging from atoms to galaxies , so eternal time may possibly inTHE // elude both in the past and in the future long periods in which no matter or energy exists . Yet by far the most significant features of the universe are not its temporal and spatial framework , but precisely those parts of space and periods of time which contain physical energy and matter . If the galaxies were propelled outward from some central mass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the ensuing billion years , as well as that central position in space and the ever widening spaces covered by the expanding universe , sets the stage for the drama of reality , rather than some other parts of time or other parts of space . But energy and matter are , like space and time , closely akin to each other . In fact , matter seems to be a kind of backwash or eddy in the wider sweep of physical energy . When the energy in suns or atoms is viewed in a relatively static , spatial perspective the resulting phenomenon is matter . When , on the other hand ? and this is by far the more usual condition ? matter is viewed in a relatively dynamic , temporal perspective , the resulting phenomenon is energy . In some parts of the universe , namely , suns which have " died " ? that is , have had their temperature and luminosity drop to zero ? or in other parts of the universe , namely , planets which have cooled ( like the crust of the earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " mass or matter appears . Yet even such inert matter is illusory , if viewed in the perspective of the " living " component molecules , atoms , and electrons which compose this " matter . " While matter is a reality , it is subordinate to the more basic conditions of energy which sustain it atomically ; and its present is " big " with the traces of previous times in which it was macroscopi76 THE QUEST FOR REALITY cally and non-atomically also more than " inert . " The Newtonian laws of mechanics ( corrected or uncorrected by Einstein ) are simply an abstraction in terms of mass , space , and time , from the wider and deeper drama of atomic energy , light , and heat , which gives us a truer clue to the universe . And yet surrounding the careers of all blazing suns in the countless exploding and expanding galaxies , and even pervading all these suns upon suns , and galaxies upon galaxies , sit the two silent partners of reality ? space and time , comprising in their own terms quantitatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves which contain a mere sun or a mere electron . This whole picture is the mechanical picture of the universe , and it is a true and real one as far as it goes . It is a phase of the quest for wisdom to try to show that it does not go very far . Energy cooling into matter , suns reared upon physical compounds of various temperatures and luminosities , compounds of matter comprising still more energy on a molecular , atomic , and subatomic basis , all within space and time ? all this is the framework of reality , but it is the emptiest of all frameworks , not indicating the more basic features of life , creativity , human selfhood , and values . SUBSTANCE AND CAUSALITY : THE ENDURING AND TRANSITIVE ASPECTS OF NATURE The mechanical pattern of nature , though drawn usually from a consideration of galaxies and atoms , must not be thought to bear no relation to " macroscopic " objects on the surface of the earth . Strictly // speaking , stones , plants , animal bodies and human be-ings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objects , are composed of electrons and protons , and fol-low the same laws of motion and combustion as any matter whatsoever . Whatever additional , and more basic , characteristics plants , animals , and men are found to display , they will do so in a universe which has the more widely operating characteristics of physical energy . It is the essence of a mechanistic philosophy , such as that of Democritus , Hobbes , and the behavior-ists , to contend that there is nothing more than physical energy anywhere . Even if the mechanical view of the world turns out to be decidedly restricted in its contribution to the solu-tion of the quest for reality , one general fact remains . The relation of space to time , the still more specific re-lation of energy to matter , provides an important clue to the general nature of everything , and more specifi-cally , of the human self . ' If matter is a special con-figuration of energy , viewed in a spatial aspect , then some forms of energy share , in some measure , the prop-erties of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is eternal . In the language of Parmenides , it is some-thing that genuinely is , apart from the intrusions of change . Now those properties of matter which set it apart from more dynamic features of nature consist precisely in its tendency to endure . Unlike space , matter never remains totally unchanged , but relatively speak-ing , matter has a passivity , a tendency to retain fixed properties , in a way that its component parts do not . The relatively enduring aspects of sets of physical quali78 THE QUEST FOR REALITY ties point to a unity persevering through change , which may be called substance . There is no antecedent assurance that matter will be the only reality which forms a temporary eddy of substance in the wider sweep of physical energy . In fact , we shall not be surprised to discover that some special types of matter ? namely , organisms , as well as some aspects of human beings ? reveal tendencies to persevere in themselves throughout stretches of time in a way that matter in general does not . In any case , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which ( like space ) tends to retain those properties ( unlike space ) temporarily , is provided even within the mechanical pattern of the universe . Even blazing suns and whirling electrons , dynamic sources of energy though they be , may be spoken of somewhat figuratively as " things , " abstracted from the ever developing careers which constitute their nature . On the other hand , the same sort of conclusion may be carried over from the changing aspects of atoms and galaxies to the more ordinary objects on the surface of the earth . Physical energy seems to be a more basic feature of the universe than " inert " matter . But physical energy is simply the behavior of suns and atoms in their more dynamic aspects . The transitive features of the mechanical pattern of the universe imply a certain type of orderliness in time . The careers of suns and atoms may be predicted by observing their relations to other suns and atoms , the resulting configurations , the extent of energies absorbed or released , and the distances in space traversed in calculable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanistic metaphysicians ( Democritus , Hobbes , and the beTHE // haviorists ) concerning the rule of causation in the realms of astronomy and atomic physics . Even the celebrated " indeterminism " of Heisenberg in the paths of the atoms does not rule out a large measure of predictability . Whatever the verdict of physics concerning the orderliness of atomic behavior , the student of metaphysics must reckon with a large measure of ironclad mechanical causality in the universe as a whole : the idea that event B may be known to result inevitably from the occurrence of event A. Like time , the inevitable " flow " of one occurrence from another among physical and chemical processes provides the notion of causation as one of the features of the behavior of some and possibly all objects . Just as the resemblance between things and space indicates the presence of substances in nature , so the likeness between processes and time indicates the operation of causal law . Whatever deeper characteristics things may possess in addition , they lie within the general framework of a universe in which things in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a series of predictable transitive states . Only if the mechanical pattern revealed the whole story , only then would these likenesses of things to space and time provide the major clue to the nature of man and his place in the universe . CHAPTER V Organism and Evolution THE INDEFINABILITY OF " LIFE " There is no reason to assume that the physical composition of the earth is different from that of other planets of our own or other suns . Aside from differences in temperature , density of matter , and size , the earth appears to have been formed in the same way that other satellites were probably formed , and to be composed of the same materials ? matter and energy . In one way , however , the earth is apparently quite unique : In the course of its history the earth has been the bearer of about ten million types of organic life . In the study of life , the scientific investigator is frequently distressed at the difficulty with which exact quantitative description is possible . Living processes , however closely resembling some types @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not readily be described in mechanical terms , i.e. , exclusively in terms of space , time , mass , and energy . In the past , the biological investigator has been hampered by certain theorists who have insisted that life is to be treated as a kind of mystical " essence " which defies all further description . In protest against this high-handed procedure , and in imitation of the 80 // methods of the highly successful fields of physics and chemistry , the biologist has often adopted what he has called a mechanistic approach . He has assumed that all biological processes reduce ultimately to the behavior of atoms and molecules explicable in quantitative terms . The cautious biologist is the first to admit that his evidence for this contention is far from complete ; but he holds that all progress in biology has been the outcome of this assumption ; while the vitalistic view which defends the " indefinable essence " of life has not only been a barren one , but has actually prevented progress in knowledge . In spite of this proclaimed " mechanistic " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not succeed in equating any basic aspect of life with those physical and chemical processes which are genuinely mechanical . At every stage of his investigation , he points out properties of life which , however similar to physical energy in inorganic matter , are not identical with it . The residue is always precisely the indefinable something , " life . " In the quest for wisdom , we must avoid the one-sided approach of vitalism and the equally narrow assumptions of the mechanist . Just as the mechanical categories of space , time , matter , and energy are taken as indubitably given facts of reality , none the less real because indefinable ; so those properties of life ? certain chemical and physical properties , metabolism , growth , reproduction , adaptability , and cellular structure ? are constituent features of a level of reality . In other words , there is equally little reason to try to " reduce " life to mechanical properties as there is to " elevate " the me82 THE QUEST FOR REALITY chanical universe to the status of a living " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one-sided distortion , however useful a single , simple pattern may be for the purposes of specialized investigation . THE PROPERTIES AND PROCESSES OF LIFE The various materials which comprise a living thing are referred to collectively as protoplasm . The nature of life depends upon the composition of the different materials which together form protoplasm , the mode of connection between these materials , and the various modes of behavior of these materials acting as a whole . The chief chemicals which go to make up protoplasm are three types of carbon compounds : carbohydrates , fats , and proteins . Some of these substances are found in nature apart from living things ; other protoplasmic materials have been successfully made in laboratories by man ; but many of these materials seem to be formed only in living things . The most significant characteristic of fats lies in the fact that they contain a high degree of energy which in a living organism is stored in the form of food reserves to be used in emergencies . This procedure is nothing more or less than an important aspect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feature of proteins lies in the fact that they are constructed out of a type of compound known as amino acid . Using this acid as a foundation , living organisms build vast protein molecules consisting at times of as many as several thousand atoms . These protein compounds are formed in an almost endless variety in such a way that each particular living species has its // own type of protein , and even each individual organism differs from others in its particular protein composition . Life is not to be equated with these various types of carbon compounds . In fact , all these chemical sub-stances ought , more appropriately , to be called " the disintegration products of protoplasm . " Protoplasm it-self involves the organization of these components in a very definite fashion . " Active living protoplasm , whether that of animals or plants , whether of man or the lowliest organism , appears to the naked eye , or to the eye aided by the compound microscope , as a semi-fluid or viscous material , sometimes colored but com-monly practically colorless and almost transparent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a more or less complex mix-ture of different ingredients such as granules , fibers , droplets of liquid , imbedded in a more or less structure-less ground-substance , or matrix . " One of the most striking features of life is metabo-lism , the process by means of which protoplasm appro-priates inorganic materials from its environment , trans-forms these materials into its own specific chemical ingredients , and expends these ingredients by releasing its own energy , chiefly in the form of oxidation . The first part of this process is the building up of energy , called anabolism ; the second is a process of using energy , called katabolism . These processes occur simul-taneously all the time in living organisms . In youth the anabolic processes exceed the katabolic ones , with the // result that the organism becomes larger in size and more differentiated in its tissues and structures . In old age the katabolic processes are dominant , the wasting away ultimately proceeding to a point at which death occurs . Life is not identical with the inorganic com-ponents of protoplasm , nor with the organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one important as-pect of life is identical with the two-way process of the building up and tearing down of highly complex chem-ical materials . Other important modes of living behav-ior are irritability , conductivity , and adaptability to environment . " Local responses to stimuli may be in the form of direct contraction , direct secretion , direct growth changes ; more commonly , however , stimuli af-fecting one region , such as a sensory cell , affect not only the region stimulated , but are transmitted through the general protoplasm ( or through special transmitting structures such as nerve fibers ) to other parts capable of responding by modifications of a chemical or phys-ical character . This is probably the basis of the main-tenance of individuality in organisms , of nervous co-ordination , and of adaptive behavior . . . . Changes that are of advantage to the organism and tend to keep it adjusted to its environment are known as adaptive changes . " 2 Some organisms are composed of one cell only . Single-celled organisms are either protozoa ( unicellular animals ) , protophyta ( unicellular plants ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special type of protophyta . These cellular units of life are not identi-cal with the walls confining them , but rather with the // protoplasm inside . Other organisms ? metazoa and metaphyta ? are composed of many cells . In these types of life , " the cell is no longer the real unit of organization , but is only a minor structural unit subservient to the organism as a whole . " The organism controls the individual cells , and determines the various specialized functions of each . In both single-celled and manycelled organisms , there is an active region where the rate of the metabolic processes is highest , and this active region dominates the whole system . The preservation of the organic unity or individuality depends upon this domination of the whole from a central portion . THE " TELIC " OR PURPOSIVE NATURE OF LIVING PROCESSES There have been roughly ten million types of life on earth , including both extinct forms and present types . All of these forms have possessed the general characteristics which we have briefly examined : certain chemical and physical properties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irritability , adaptation . and cellular structure . All of these properties and processes have as their " aim " or " end " the development and preservation of the individual organism , and the perpetuation of life in succeeding individuals . In other words , there is a type of causal influence operating in life which may be called " telic " or purposive . To understand the precise nature and significance of " telic " causation , the concept of purposiveness must be examined , and then contrasted with the type of mechanical causation which is found in all inanimate mat86 THE QUEST FOR REALITY ter . The word " purpose " is highly ambiguous . If , in ordinary conversation , the question is asked , " Is nature purposive ? " at least three different ideas may be meant : ( 1 ) Does nature as a whole or any part of it reflect the " conscious plan " of a divine Creator ? Just as an El-gin watch reflects in its internal structure and function-ing the plan or idea of the watchmaker , do we find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This question concerns the possible existence and characteristics of a divine power or God.3 Does nature or any part of it show the presence of a " conscious plan " worked out and executed by nature itself or any part of it ? In other words , is nature itself or any part of it a conscious agency which itself does the planning ? Now since man is a part of nature , and since man has conscious purposes and plans , then at least a part of nature , namely , man , is purposive in this conscious sense . By analogy , may this idea of conscious human purposiveness be applied to other types of life , plants , animals , and bacteria ? Do some plants and some animals other than man have conscious purposes in their behavior ? As plausible as this question may be in relation to dogs or horses , its meaning becomes very obscure in reference to most plants and animals , and in reference to all protozoa , protophyta , and bacteria . We would seem to rob the expression " conscious purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find this kind of purposive behavior in all types of life . Does a part of nature ? namely , every living organism ? display the operation of a kind of natural telic adjustment ? This question refers neither to the existORGANISM // ence of a divine planner nor to the presence of con-scious purposiveness in all types of life . Now the proc-esses of natural purposiveness may contain the " germ " of the sort of process which in man is conscious . But this very general sort of natural teleology ? consti-tuted by the presence of protoplasm , and the opera-tion of metabolism , growth , reproduction , and adapta-tion ? is far from identical with the kind of purposive activities which human beings carry out . There is no more identity between natural purposiveness and hu-man purposes , on the one side , than between natural purposiveness and mechanical motion and energy , on the other , however great the likenesses may be in both cases . Is nature purposive ? This question , if understood in the third sense as referring only to natural telic proc-esses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or aim or telos of metabolism is the development and maintenance of the individuality of the organism . " Individuality is maintained throughout life in spite of the fact that the actual chemical constitution of living substance is constantly changing . " 4 A certain kind of substance , the living individual , is found in even the the subhuman , organic realm to " carry over " from mo-ment to moment through a span of time , with no ces-sation of the continuing metabolic transformations of chemicals . This purposiveness operates continually un-til death , and even the process of death does not in-volve merely the operation of chemical processes of an inorganic sort , but rather the failure of the metabolic processes to continue to attain their end . The excessive // domination of katabolism over anabolism does not mean that the former is identical with death : A certain degree of katabolism is as essential to life as is anabolism . The destruction of the balance between the two processes brings death , for the balance between the two aims at life . Similarly , growth and reproduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structural features of the individual , and the appearance of new individual offspring . The telos of a young tadpole consists in the loss of its tail , the acquisition of legs , and the change in shape and size which will make it into a frog . Its further telos is the reproduction of itself in the form of new tadpoles . The lack of food , the failure of metabolism , growth , or reproduction , because of structural or functional deficiencies , or , in general , an unfavorable environment , will lead to the death of the individual . just as a man dying of thirst may have an ocean of salt water around him , so an organism may die from the failure of metabolic processes in spite of the existence of an ocean of chemical energy around it in an unavailable form . The uselessness of that chemical energy may be due to the particular form in which it exists , or it may be due to structural and functional defects in the organism itself . Similarly , various adaptive processes , local responses to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nervous co-ordination have as their aim or telos the maintenance of the individuality in an organism . These natural telic processes together constitute the organism 's adaptation to environment , and they may involve structural or chemical changes , or mere motion . Even // the most settled type of life includes constant , wide adaptations . Normal seasonal changes in the weather bring about corresponding adaptive responses on the part of a tree . But organisms are often forced to adapt themselves to wide and unusual changes in environment . A young dog may have a serious case of distemper . All of the bodily functions and processes of the dog combine to enable him to survive this illness : Various glands secrete to a greater extent than usual ; certain blood cells " combat " the disease ; a high fever appears . Successful adaptation to a new environment means the continuance of the individual living organism . Lack of success means death . Does the tadpole " try " to become a frog ? Does the dog " try " to overcome distemper ? Here again there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tadpole does not plan to become a fine , big frog . Yet in the sense that the metabolic processes , differentiation in function and structure , and growth have as their natural outcome the transformation of the tadpole into a frog , in this sense the processes are telic or purposive . To the extent that the various metabolic and glandular processes of the dog have as their natural outcome the extinction of the distemper , in this sense the processes have a purpose . A great deal of debate between mechanists and vitalists would be found to be useless , if the significance of natural teleology were more carefully investigated . RHYTHMICITY : THE SIGNIFICANCE OF DEATH In metabolism , in. reproduction , in the growth and division of cells , in breathing , in the heartbeat , and in // a host of other living processes , there are cycles or rhythms . Indeed , in the very balance between anabolism and katabolism there is a basic rhythm which constitutes the life-span of the individual . In intervals of time which vary from a few moments to many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Death is as natural an outcome of this cas birth is cycle the outcome of reproductive processes . This fact is of great importance in the quest for wisdom . For man is an animal , whatever else he may also be . Even if the " mechanistic " scientist could be persuaded to adopt the conception of natural teleology , the genuine metaphysical problem would hardly thereby become settled . For natural teleology does not lead to the continuing life of an individual organism beyond the end of his natural life-cycle . If man is entirely subject to the natural conditions which lead inevitably to the final domination of katabolism over anabolism , man is mortal , and whatever additional , conscious qualities and values his life may include , man ceases at death to be a living individual . Now there is no evidence within the realm of organic life to indicate that human nature is exclusively or even chiefly constituted by its organic make-up . Until , therefore , in our quest for reality we discover what actually constitutes human nature we are not in a position definitely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immortality of the human soul . However , the organic categories teach us this much : Only if man is something more than an organism ( and an organism he is of course also ) , only then does man stand any chance of being immortal ; while even // if man is found to be something more than organic ( to wit , a conscious , creative self ) , even then his immortality , though possible , is not definitely established merely by that fact . In any event , not even the millions of species other than man may be called entirely mechanical . All life is purposive in the natural sense which we have investigated . Whatever man turns out to be , he is one living type among millions , possessing all the properties , and displaying all the processes , common to all these other types . Furthermore , man and all other living types are found on a single planet in one among many solar systems in one among countless galaxies of energy in space and time . THE CO-ORDINATION OF MECHANICAL AND TELIC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that mechanical causation is a fact in the universe . Mechanical causation means that any event B may be discovered to " flow " necessarily from an antecedent event A , in such a way that the nature of the later event is predictable from the occurrence of the earlier . In this chapter , it has been pointed out that in living processes , another type of causation called teleology is a fact . Telic causation means that in living processes a later condition ? the full-grown , adapted organism , and possibly its offspring ? is the " aim " or " goal " toward which an earlier piece of behavior is directed . In mechanical causation the past event determines the present one ; in teleology the future determines the present . Are these two types of causation incompatible ? Does mechanical causation // make teleology impossible , or does telic behavior indicate a real breach in the realm of mechanical law ? If the theory of mechanical causation were accepted in the sense in which it is often formulated in physics and astronomy , there would indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any sort . Nor does the fact that in atomic physics there is a new theory called the doctrine of indeterminacy ( postulating a certain degree of unpredictability in the behavior of atoms ) offer any justification for abandoning the concept of mechanical causation in the realm of physics as a whole , and a fortiori none for abandoning it in philosophy . Yet even in physics the idea of necessary physical causation implies an important metaphysical corollary : namely , the doctrine that the universe is composed of nothing but space , time , matter , and energy . The quest for wisdom , on the other hand , while accepting these quantitative categories as far as they go , does not acquiesce in the mechanist 's contention that these mechanical categories supply the whole , or even the major , clue to the nature of reality . Considered not as a complete pattern , but merely as the broadest framework within which reality centers , space , time , and causal energy may be considered as real and as operating with no breaks . In the inorganic realms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widely operative to be discarded with relation to those phenomena . But with relation to some other aspect of reality , with relation to some other descriptive category , there is no compulsion upon the student of philosophy to accept mechanical causation as the clue to the facts , if other evidence is forthcoming . // Now the masses of data of biological science ? concerning metabolism , growth , reproduction , adaptation , and cellular structures ? are evidence of the operation in the organic realm of another type of causation , teleology . To avoid the fallacy of pseudo-simplicity , it is as necessary not to interpret telic causation mechanically in relation to life , as it is to avoid interpreting the behavior of atoms , stones , and stars in a telic manner . The categories of mechanism and organism do not overlap , but are co-ordinate with each other in the facts about reality which they reveal . Nothing in the manner of the anabolic composition of protein compounds by an organism contradicts the mechanical picture of the coming together of the atoms which form those compounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which this composition is effected with an end , namely , the maintenance of a living individual . On one level , the chemicals combine mechanically , and viewed entirely on that level , there is no end or telos ; while , on the other level , the same combination effects and sustains the existence of life , and , therefore , operates teleologically . The physicist may ignore the organic features , the biologist may ignore the electronic details , but each of them is right as far as he goes . In the quest for wisdom both sets of facts and types of causation are taken as indicative of important levels or categories of reality within which man , too , has his place and level . THE EVOLUTION OF THE SPECIES The idea of one type of life evolving from another is an extremely old theory . Anaximander ( 611-ca. 540 // B.c. ) in one of his fragments speaks of man coming from a fish . Empedocles ( ca. 500-ca. 450 B.C. ) expands the idea of evolution to include all types of things , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a circular process beginning with a condition of pure undifferentiated " being , " held together by a kind of attractive force called " love . " This single , spherical being began to disintegrate with the entrance of a repulsive force called " strife , " and the departure of " love . " With the continual increase of differentiation , all specific types and compounds became sorted out , and ultimately everything was broken down into the simplest elements ( which in Greek chemistry were fire , air , earth , and water ) . In this stage , " love " had completely departed , and " strife " held all the elements separate . Then , however , came the circular reversal of the process , with the attractive , integrating force of " love " beginning to gain the ascendancy , expelling " strife " and bringing the compounds back together again , with the ultimate result that the original state of a single , undifferentiated " being , " re-emerged . Then the entire cycle repeated itself . Chiefly because of the prestige of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a long time . Aristotle believed indeed in degrees or levels of " being " or reality , called " essences . " He also believed that there was a kind of " thrust " forward from the lowest , simplest types of inorganic substances , upward through the organic types , plants , animals , and men , ultimately toward a prime mover , God . In other words , the whole universe , and everything in it was , according to Aristotle , telic through and through . But // Aristotle 's theory was anti-evolutionary for two reasons . In the first place , the levels of essence from inorganic matter , through plants , animals , and men were definitely separated from each other , in spite of the common telic character of those levels . Acorns developed definitely toward oaks , and only in a derivative sense toward anything else . In the second place , telic development within the various species , and in the universe as a whole was a logical , nontemporal movement , and not a kind of change in time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense already actualized in the acorn , and the actual temporal development of the oak was the mere fulfillment of a nontemporal , already real " essence . " In modern philosophy , Giordano Bruno ( 1548 ? 1600 ) elaborated an evolutionary theory of the nature of the universe . According to him , there are little " smallest " elements of spiritual energy which in the course of time develop or evolve into the simpler inorganic compounds , organisms , plants , animals , and eventually into human minds . This theory was worked out even more elaborately by Leibniz ( 1646 ? 1716 ) . There are , Leibniz held , an infinite number of centers of spiritual force called monads . Each of these contains within it a pattern of the whole universe . Bare monads are the simpler types ( stones and chairs ) the consciousness of which is somewhat " dazed . " Plants represent a more highly evolved and complex type of monad . Animals are still more developed , and are called conscious monads . Human beings are not only complex , conscious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to mirror fully the whole universe in them96 THE QUEST FOR REALITY selves . In the theories of both Bruno and Leibniz , the idea of the complex types evolving out of the simpler ones is stressed . A stone is a potential plant , animal , and man . There are also suggestions in the ideas of these thinkers that the history of the individual repeats the history of the race , an idea which modern biological investigation has tended to confirm . The theory of evolution as advanced by Charles Darwin in 1859 differs markedly from those of the abovementioned men in two important respects . In the first place , Darwin 's theory is exclusively a biological , rather than a cosmic theory . It made no claim to be an account of the nature of inorganic physical and chemical processes , but dealt exclusively with life . It was not a theory of the nature of all reality , but only an account of certain biological happenings . In the second place , it lacked the element of speculation , which is peculiar to metaphysics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confirmation by observed phenomena . EVIDENCES OF EVOLUTION The modern theory of evolution , in its restricted biological context , means two things : ( 1 ) All life comes from a common origin . ( 2 ) Various species have emerged by a modification of previous types , in such a way that all species are merely stages in one broader life process . Darwin gave a more specialized account of the modification of the species , called the doctrine of natural selection . This process was called by Huxley the survival of the fittest , although more appropriately it // might be called the survival of the fitter , or even the survival of the less unfit . A sample of the modification of a species would be the change in a certain type of butterfly . Let us imagine that there are two species of butterfly . One has brown wings , and the other yellow . Now in the region ( environment ) in which these butterflies live , let us assume that there are hawks which find the brown type inedible , and the yellow type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the yellow ones would tend to be eaten and to die out , while the brown ones would survive . If among the offspring of the yellow type , a brownish set of wings happened to appear , this member of the yellow species would be mistaken by the hawks for a member of the other species , and would be let alone . Its type with the yellow-brown wings would survive because of this " protective resemblance , " while the rest of the yellow type would become extinct . Although there are many other alleged examples of the operation of natural selection , many biologists prefer to ignore the question of what precise factors bring about the modification of species , and restrict their investigations more to the observation of what particular changes have come about . In the light of various investigations , the following evidences are brought forward for the modification of the species , and indirectly for the contention that all life has a common source . ( 1 ) Fossil remains have been discovered in layers under the surface of the earth . The order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in time . If the various structures were evolving from the earlier types to the present ones , there ought to be found a // gradual change in the types in the order of the layers beneath the surface of the earth . In fact the layers , be-ginning with the deepest and proceeding toward the surface , indicate precisely such an orderly change in structure . " Through nearly thirty stages , covering a period of approximately two million years , the modern horse is traced from a small animal of about the size of a fox , possessing several toes . " ' Further fossil forms intermediate between very different present types have been predicted and found . ( 2 ) Similarly , the distri-bution of fossil remains over various geographical areas supports the evolutionary theory of the interrelatedness of the species . Where different types of life have ex-isted in widely separated sections of a continent , inter-mediate types have been predicted in the middle areas , and discovered there . ( 3 ) Furthermore , by classifying types of life according to comparative anatomy , an orderly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amoebas , on through the jellyfish , star-fish , chordates , vertebrates , reptiles , and mammals , has been possible ; or again from the amoeba , on through the segmented worms , snails , lobsters , and insects . The same sort of thing has been possible within the plant kingdom , with an original type of primitive plant-animal probably lying back of all life . Also , homologous structures are found in modern animals : " the fore leg of a lizard , the wing of a bird and of a bat , the burrow-ing shovel of a mole , the flipper of a whale , the fore leg of a horse , the human arm and hand . " Likewise , in a // human being the appendix and the muscles of the ears are probably vestiges of earlier times when these struc-tures had functions . ( 4 ) Again , wide experimentation by man in cross-breeding has resulted in the deliberate production of new types , probably in the same manner that new forms are somewhat accidentally brought about in nature . ( 5 ) Lastly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ context , the history of the in-dividual tends to repeat the history of the life process as a whole . " The embryos of reptiles , birds , and mam-mals are , up to a certain stage , indistinguishable . At one point , the circulatory systems of all mammalians are es-sentially fishlike . In embryos , also , there occur vestigial structures , many of which , however , disappear before birth . " G Also , blood tests show a marked resemblance between the types of blood of animals close to each other in evolutionary development : the higher anthro-poid apes and man , a horse and an ass , a hare and a rabbit , a gibbon and an orang . The age of the crust of the earth is probably about a billion years . The first vertebrates probably lived for a period of at least twenty-five million years , beginning not earlier than three hundred million years ago , and not later than 30 million years ago . The early mammals probably lived for a period not exceeding three and a half million years , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than four million years ago . The species intermediate between the animals and man probably lived for a period of not more than a half million years . Man appeared probably about twenty thousand years ago .
