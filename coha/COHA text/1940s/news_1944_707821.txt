txt A shortage of farm machinery described as being so serious t hat War Food Administrator Jones has refused to bring it out into the open is threaten . ing to become one of the major scandals of the war , It became known today . Far m- leaders blame the shortage  --  which they say threatens international disaster on the food front ? on farm machinery officials of the war production board and some farm machine manufacturers . The situation is said to be so serious that WPB Chairman Nelson is taking time off from his job of keeping war factories going to take a special trip to Detroit , Mich. , the first week in June with leaders of the national farm organizations to make a personal investigation . Farm leaders assert that delay of the investigation until June is dangerously long . Output of Planters Lags . Agricultural men said between 20 and 50 per cent fewer farm tools have been produced than the WPB and the WFA assured farm e rs would be manufactured during winter for use this year . Instead of there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 16,000 had been delivered by manufacturers up to April 1 . This machine Is considered to be essential in the midwestern corn belt this year , where wet weather has delayed crops to such an extent that planting must be done in a hurry if the nation 's necessary corn crop Is to be planted . In addition , there are serious shortages of many other types of planting tools , according to the WFA . Haying machinery production is said to be lagging badly , and the shortage of small Combines for harvesting small grain crops is considered also to be serious . Combines Below Estimates . Only tractors and large combines have been produced In anything like the promised quantities , which are far below actual requirements , the farm men said . Leaders of the national farm organizations , suspecting that the New Deal agencies were hiding something in their figures on the production of farm machinery , sent Edward A. O'Neal , president of the American Farm Bureau federation , to call Thursday on administrator Jones . . The farm leaders included Fred Brenckman , Washington representative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the national cooperative milk producers federation , and Ezra T. Benson , secretary of the national council of farm cooperatives . According to the Washington Farm Reporter , a publication of the national grange , written by agricultural service associates , a group of writers that works closely with leaders of all major farm organizations , this Is what took place : " Could it be that the farm machinery division of the WPB was n't going to fulfil its program ? " O'Neal asked Jones . " Could it he that it was dishing out glamorized reports ? " It ? not only could be , but was , said Jones . He called in one of his specialists to prove it . Saying lie would do everything in his power to " needle " the WPB Into action , Jones refused O'Neal 's demand to do something about it immediately . He let it be known that the White House has forbidden Liter-agency squabbles between now and Nov. 7 , and that he was n't going to be the one to disobey White House orders . The Farm Reporter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a conference of other farm organization leaders . " A joint statement blasting the whole rotten moss wide open to the public view should be Irmo ( ' sooner than immediately , " O'Neal reportedly told the farm men . Nelson Clint Follows . " Not so fast , " retorted the other leaders . " Donald Nelson has been about the only big shot in the administration high command to give the farmers a break . Now , let 's have a cozy chat with Mr. Nelson before we blow the wind . " And that 's what happened . The farm leaders visited Nelson 's office Friday . According to their reports , he listened to O'Neal accuse the WPB farm machinery division of falsifying production figures by reporting output in dollar value rather than in numbers of machine units . " You ca n't raise corn with dollar signs , " O'Neal reportedly shouted . The farm leaders asserted the large manufacturers of farm machinery , referred to by WFA specialists in their conversations as " the machinery trust , " actually are responsible for the failure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Excess Quotas Asserted . The farm men said that last fall , when farm machinery quotas were being established , the big manufacturers , in an attempt to hold their competitive market positions , asked the WPB for larger quotas than they could fill , taking the business from the smaller manufacturers that could have produced the tools . These manufacturers knew at the time that they could n't nil melr quotas , the farm leaders said , and It was apparent to the entire industry before February that they would n't meet them by a wide margin . But the small manufacturers were afraid to complain , the farm men said , because they knew if they lifted their voices In criticism of the big companies they would be driven out of business after the war . They said Jones knew about it , but he would n't complain audibly for political reasons . Thus , they said , nothing was done . " The farm machinery program has gone to blazes in a basket , say those on the inside , " Washington Farm Reporter commented . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick remedy is found . "
