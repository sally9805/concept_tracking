txt United States Prosecutor Robert H. Jackson demanded today the conviction of twenty-two top Nazis as ruthless conspirators to wage aggressive war . He charged they were just as guilty as Hitler because they " put a loaded gun in his eager hands . " The British prosecutor , Sir Hartley W. Shawcross , following Mr. Jackson in the summations to the International Military Tribunal , demanded that the Nazi leaders be put to death as " common murderers . " Mr. Jackson opened the prosecution 's summing up for the Allied nationals against Hermann Goer- ing and his twenty-one co-defendants after eight months of trial . Mr. Jackson assailed the defense pleas as " Nazi double talk . " To the tribunal he said in con-clusion : " If you were to say of these men that they are not guilty , it would be as true to say there has been no war , there are no slain , there has been no crime . " Briton 's Charge Is of Murders The British prosecutor asserted the prisoners were guilty of " 12 , - 000,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and directed " the cold , calculated , deliberate attempt to destroy nations and races through murder conducted like some mass production industry in the gas chambers and ovens " of horror camps . For the first time in several months there was scarcely an empty seat in the courtroom as Mr. Jackson spun out his charges in barbed and caustic tones . Letting his eyes rove over the hierarchy of the Nazi regime that Hitler boasted would last a thousand years  --  Goering , Joachim von Ribbentrop , Julius Streicher , Hjalmar Schacht , Field Marshal Gen. Wilhelm Keitel , Col. Gen. Alfred Jodl and the rest  --  the American prosecutor asserted : " What these men have overlooked is that Adolf Hitler 's acts are their acts . It was these men among millions of others , and it was these men leading millions of others , who built up Adolf Hitler and vested in his psychopathic personality not only innumerable lesser decisions but the supreme issue of war or peace . " They intoxicated him with power and adulation . They fed his hates and aroused his fears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was left to Hitler to pull the trigger , and when he did they all at that time approved . " " Nowhere , " Mr. Jackson went on , " do we find an instance where any one of the defendants stood up against the rest and said , ' This thing is wrong and I will not go along with it . ' " In the dock , with ear - phones pressed to their heads , the accused listened to Mr. Jackson 's every word , displaying their interest with a mixture of frowns and grins . Hess Is Not in Court Rudolf Hess , the third ranking German before he parachuted into Scotland and started his incredible insanity hoax , was the only defendant missing besides Martin Bormann , who is being tried in absentia .

Mr. Jackson , a justice of the United States Supreme Court on leave for the prosecution of the main Nazi war crimes defendants , limited his summation to the charge of conspiracy . He left it to the British , Russian and French prosecutors to deal with these other counts of the indictment : Crimes against peace , war crimes and crimes against humanity . Sir Hartley , taking up summation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's ringleaders as " common murderers " and as men who planned and waged a world war in defiance of treaties and pledges to keep p , , ace , " is not in doubt . " Arguing for conviction of the German chieftains for the crime against peace that heads the long indictment , Sir Hartley stated : " Let it be said plainly now that these defendants are charged also as common murderers . " That charge alone merits imposition of the supreme penalty and joinder of this crime against peace in the indictment c in add nothing to the penalty which may be imposed on these individuals . " But he said " more is at stake here than the fate of these individuals . " " It is a fundamental part of these proceedings , " he emphasized , " to establish for all time that international law has power * * to declare that a war is criminal and to deal with those who aid and abet their states in its commission .
