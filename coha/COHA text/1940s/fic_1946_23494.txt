MOURNER FOR PEGASUS A Story MARGARET SHEDD T HE room was so full it bulged . There was sunlight , firelight , a baby just walking , some mothers around a tea table , three three-year-olds in front of a puppet theater , and two eight-year-olds behind it . This was life at combustion point and most concentrate around the puppet stage . Only the group of mothers added nothing to the intensity of living these walls enclosed . It was a children 's party and the mothers had wordlessly agreed to let it be an afternoon of no bridge , no gossip , to spare themselves tongue and mind and bask back into maternity , which is very restful . So the resting mothers at the tea table ate angel cake , and yellow cake made from the yolks . Once in a while they gave a glance at the children , but they were unaware of the maelstrom whirling round the puppet theater . Not that it was noisy over there . The three-year-olds sat on squatty little red stools , and the puppets that were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But these children , alike in age , were so divergent in character that mere adjacency set up a cosmic friction . Of course the earmark of children 's parties is that the participants must be of an age , often omitting real friends to include the mother 's schoolmate 's daughter who was born within two weeks of Trudge , but whom Trudge seldom sees , and certainly has not seen now , although her arrival was triumphant in blue ruffles and sausage curls . There was this little girl and there was the boy Trudge and there was another boy , beautifully mannered , watching the puppet show with equanimity , a fixed smile , and a good deal of inner scorn . He was a perfect guest . But Trudge could not be called a perfect host , although the party was his , to celebrate his birthday , and the play was being presented in his honor by his eight-year-old sister and her best friend . Trudge acted exactly as if he were alone in the room . His guests did not interest him and he made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else . It was not that it pleased him or displeased him ; nothing trivial like that . He simply gave it his whole attention , a released force of untold potency . He never took his eyes off the stage , even now when the baby made a disturbance in another part of the room and Trudge got up and pointed at the baby to protest this . The baby had come because he was the brother of Trudge 's sister 's best friend . She had written the puppet play , although Trudge 's sister managed to give the impression she was responsible by putting her head through the curtain to announce the title , Rescue . The real author had asserted herself to the extent of operating the hero horse who rescued his master . And the rescue was about to come off . The horse was saying , " I shall fly to my master and save him from the dirty Japs ! " Just then the baby interrupted again and Trudge , already on his feet , ejaculated furiously , but still watching the horse : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk . You hush up and listen . " The baby did n't listen ; he dumped over a drawer of music he had been working noisily to dislodge . In the face of this outrage Trudge had to take his eyes off the stage . He levelled his small intense gaze at the baby . " Bad baby ! " he said with such tragic force that the baby did look at him startled , and intrigued by the tone of violence came toward Trudge and left his music drawer . U P TO now there had been that pool of relaxed fertility , the mothers . There had been that marvelous incipience on all sides of the puppet stage , which was set on a chair in the curtains of a doorway : behind the curtain , the unseen but felt antagonism of the assorted sisters ; before the curtain , the three-year-olds like yellow and red and blue on a painter 's palette . Even the puppets added something , seated there among the children . But above all there had been the horse on the stage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very much horse except for his straight , obstinate legs . And finally there had been the perambulatory excitement of the baby , wandering about the room in never abated sentience , examining the room and reminding it of its ancient and secret fastnesses . The baby , travelling Ulysses-like , had been forgotten by all but his own mother , though faintly recognized it is true by the other mothers in some archaic mental process as a pleasant demonstration of their own uberty . Unknown to themselves they had been ready to leap up if he got too near the fire or the stairway . But they had not been thinking about him , they so comfortable in the afternoon sun with cakes and tea . To his mother it was a little clearer ; if she did n't have to put it in words she knew that the baby , running busy in the clear yet faint meeting of sun and firelight , was will , clattering unstopped in a beautiful world , indomitable will , since falling he rose without distress or decided to stay down and roll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little hand resting on his mother 's knee , not caressing , just stopping for a minute at a familiar caravan-MAGAZINE serai in a place made up of new objects which must be taken into this same small brown hand , tested and measured with the hand , calling in his mouth sometimes for consultation . He was a joy whose race was just begun , not unbodied joy ; how dear and aloof his little body was to her , he squatting on poised haunches to find out the secret of a bar of sunshine on the floor . Then he found the music drawer and then he dumped it and then he answered Trudge 's intense little voice with response as lively : he reached out his arms and started toward Trudge and cried , " Hm ! " but in a minute , " Hm ? " This had all been tentative , up to this point waiting for a climax . And here something took shape , just when Trudge called him bad baby and the baby answered Trudge . The mothers and the other children , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen , and the life of the room was spotlighted on these two , as if they were the matching parts of a whole . But then almost at once interest shifted into other channels because Trudge could not really bear to keep his eyes away from the puppet horse , and the baby on that " Hm ? " discovered the yellow cake . It was on a table just low enough for him to reach . For some reason no grown hand intervened . He was able to stuff most of a large piece into his mouth , first using one hand to support himself on the table edge , because he was standing tiptoe , then finding it more important to use both hands to push in the yellow cake , palms over his mouth , fingers dancing upward . But when the cake was in , still largely visible , and he found he had kept his balance through the excitement and without hand support , he raised both his arms rejoicing , fingers especially exultant . It was the finale of a ballet about being strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes took part in the dance ; and his mouth , too , by lusty chewing . No one saw this because of the other things that were happening . The horse , having waited patiently for the interruption , had started over again , " I have wings . I have wings . I shall fly to my master . " And then there was a pause . The horse did not fly . Most people listening to his tone of voice would have known he could not ; the uncompromising legs said that this was no flying horse . But Trudge was not to be diverted from the flat promise of the spoken words . So , after a lapse , a long moment of anticipation unmet , Trudge once more arose from his little red stool with its spread legs and , in silence , he took the horse from its manual moorings and made it cavort with genteel abandon toward a theatrical heaven and then dip down again and up , a very Pegasus . And here conflict ensued . For Trudge , impelled to bring words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cramped promises to go like a bird , like an angel , flying to the rescue of that hard-pressed master , had figured without the other children . He had no trouble getting the horse from the grasp of the surprised author . But he knew nothing of the pride that burned in the author 's heart . Her play yanked out of her grasp , she emerged from the curtains ready for battle . Least of all had he taken into account the little girl he had never looked at , the one in blue ruffles , from whom rose a hurricane of protest . " Ca n't do dat " ? and she accompanied her words with all the noises of deepest anguish ? " mine horse . " By some delicate complicacy the horse she had never owned had become her horse , hers with heartbreaking certainty when he was brought out of his remote stage home and flourished about with such evident personal relish by someone not herself . The baby , too , now wanted the horse . He did n't say so but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dance about wanting the horse . He beckoned to it with his arms and hands and fingers , called to it directly , scorning go-betweens . It was a moment charged with lovely furies . All the children were wild with the zeal of possession or of depriving someone else of possession , except Trudge , who was also wild , but with the delirium of earthbound Pegasus now released . Of course it was the mothers ' turn . " Oh dear , it was such a nice party . Why did the children have to spoil it ? " J un . then Pegasus took matters under his own wing . High above all the hands that reached for him , he slipped out of even Trudge 's grasp , leaped right into the fire , and began to burn , antic and gay in death as he really never had been in life . Most of the children were delighted . The author 's pain abated with the increase of conflagration . The little girl in blue ruffles wanted to burn up all the other puppets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the fire . But Trudge began to cry , and went trying to fish the horse out of the fireplace . One of the mothers recognized that his grief was genuine and she helped him . The remains were charred but still horse ; the sound of Trudge 's weeping stopped although the tears kept rolling silently down his cheeks . So the mother said , to distract him , " Come on , Trudge , we 'll have another puppet show . You can work the puppets all yourself . Ca n't he , children ? " The children did not try to focus their eyes or ears on these words . As often , the mothers spoke to them from a distance and deep fag . Trudge had been gathered into the fog and put back of the curtains to make the puppets go , including Goldilocks , fresh and unsullied . " You know the story of little Goldilocks , dear . Remember how she was walking through the forest , all alone ? That 's right , have her walk through the forest . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long . The assorted sisters , rdgisseurs of the Pegasus tale , decided to have a funeral , that festival so dear to children 's hearts . These things happen with devastating rapidity . It is because children do so many things so fast that their lives seem to them infinitely long , really unending . At three , at five , even at eight they can barely peer over their twelfth or thirteenth year into adulthood . Sometimes , when the swing goes higher than it ever has before , there is a glimpse over that garden wall . So , before Goldilocks had a chance to get good and lost in the forest , the funeral of Pegasus was well afoot with flowers from the tea table , a shoe box , and a prayer book . Also it had been decided to use Trudge for a mourner . " He 'll be a good one . He 's really crying . I can hear him crying , " said his sister eagerly . The other three-year-old , not the girl in blue ruffles but that child of good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the events of his life , really did approve of this funeral . He watched the preparations with unsimulated pleasure , face smiling . He said , " Bury him ? " " Yes , " the sisters answered irritably . With the coffin at hand , burial seemed pretty obvious . " Worms ? " asked the little boy joyfully . " Worms eat him ? " " Sure ! " they said . Then they closed in on his affability , taking him unaware . " Go get Trudge . He 's the mourner . " Not that he knew what that was , and for him to enter the adult arena and extract Trudge was quite a feat ; that was why the sisters had asked him to do it ; but he , like all of them , was oblivious to anything but the funeral . So he went , still smiling , and without much ado got Trudge from back of the stage . It was easier than they expected . All he had to say was , " Come . " The only trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not in the plan . " It 's a funeral , " the sisters told him : Still he was unmoved . " We 're going to bury the horse in the garden . . out in the wet ground . . . " they goaded him . " Worms eat him , " cried the mannerly child in happy elaboration . It was this thrust that not only started the tears again , but wrenching sobs as well . The sisters were gratified . " Now we can have the dirge , " and they took Pegasus out of his coffin for one last look and to scatter him with ashes , although he was pretty ashy already . Came a wail from Trudge , louder than necessary for mourning purposes . He started to grabthe deceased horse . The little girls held onto Pegasus firmly and chanted in a grave , lovely rune of childhood , not in the horrid meter of that ditty , " Ashes to ashes and dust to dust . If the worms do n't get you . . . " It was this second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He arose and made onslaught . But his sister and her friend were ready too . " There you go spoiling everything again , Trudge ! " And " Ca n't you ever leave things alone ? " They were angry but very quiet ; everybody knew that the mothers must not be involved . But there was no worry about that because the mothers were all around the puppet theater now , playing with Goldilocks themselves . So for a long moment the bitter fight proceeded , shifting gradually from Pegasus to more individual assault between burial and non-burial factions . But the baby had something else to do . He picked up the horse , abandoned and sadly involved in wilting begonias . With swift decision , and eclat , he shoved Pegasus back into the fire . The mothers turned when they saw the fire brightening . The quarrel stopped when the mothers turned . Then the children saw the corpse ablaze . The baby laughed because he had found out he could stand with his head down to the floor and look backward through his fat little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but decided to play on the swings in the yard . Trudge gave Pegasus a poke farther into the fire and this time he was unmistakably and totally consumed . Then Trudge ran out of the room ahead of all of them , and he swung higher than anyone else , way above the garden wall .
