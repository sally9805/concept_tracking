On a railroad siding , General Vladimir Petrov , chief of Russian rail transportation in Berlin , sweated in his greatcoat as he directed other Russian officers who hooked engines to stalled freight cars . In its second week , the railroad workers ' strike against their Communist bosses had effectively tied up Berlin rail transport . <P> The strikers offered to man certain switch-boxes from the Western zones into Berlin 's Western sectors , while still blocking Soviet trains bound for the Russian sector . The Russians indignantly refused . Their German stooges said they were ready to pay 60% of the workers ' wages in West marks . The strikers said no . They demanded all their pay in West marks-the demand which had precipitated , the strike . When Russian violence failed , it looked as if the strike might go on for a while . U.S. and British planes stepped up their airlift loads to 8,000 tons a day . Berliners called the rail strike " the little blockade . " <P> Said one striker : " The Communists say that we are gangsters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picketing . It 's time they learned the difference . "
