The Mayor Russia Hates By JAMES P. O'DONNELL . I F history is the lengthened shadow of a man , someday the bulky silhouette of a German named Ernst Reuter will fall heavily across those pages captioned BERLIN CRISIS , 1948 . Credit by all means to the courageous pilots of the Anglo-American air lift  --  it could n't be done , and they did it . And to the Berlin masses themselves , who have shown more political courage in the past . year than the entire German nation has shown in the past century . But it could n't just happen that way . The architects of the Berlin resistance are a relatively small group of elected political leaders who are the most convincing proof yet that democracy 's best answer to the Soviet threat is more democrats . Who are they ? The wrathful SMA ? Soviet Military Administration  --  has already published the most authoritative list . Twelve Berlin leaders have been officially indicted as " reactionary Western warmongers . " At the top of that list stands the name of Berlin 's mayor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name led all the rest was a natural . The Soviets have a dogged persistency about their hates . As soon as one realizes that Reuter is an ex-communist ? a former friend of Lenin , a former hero of the Russian Revolution and a former general secretary of the German Communist Party ? the wrath is understandable . Ernst Reuter broke with Stalinism thirty years ago . His presence in Berlin today is as welcome to the man in the Kremlin as was the appearance of Banquo 's ghost at Dunsinane to an earlier tyrant . Ernst . Reuter today is fifty-nine . He is a big man , as husky as the Berlin Bear  --  the city symbol  --  itself . Tolerance and worldly wisdom have replacedsome of the old revolutionary fire in his owl-like eyes . Some , but not all . His hair is graying , but still there ; he wears it tousled and long , like a cross between a German musician and William Jennings Bryan . His round and open face always appears about to light up with some jest or wry comment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he likes to , and carries a cane because he has to . But the only thing that marks him outwardly as the politician is the inevitable cigar . He smokes all he can get on the ration . Under the air lift today Reuter is doing just about everything short of piloting planes himself . He is the elected but unseated Oberbiirgermeister ? lord mayor  --  of Greater Berlin . In the city Magistratmunicipal council  --  he holds down the two key jobs of chief of transport and of public utilities . He is the top strategist of Berlin 's largest political party , the Social Democrats , and has recently been elected to the national S.P.D. Committee . He is Berlin 's leading delegate to the German Constitutional Convention at Bonn . In what he likes to call his spare time he gives speeches , and it is in these speeches that an observer can most readily see why " The Turk " is so beloved by the common people of Berlin . He has that indefinable color that transforms the politician into the leader , the single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's present mayor played a role In the Russian October revolution is an interesting sidelight on a singular career . But it is only a Youthful sidelight , at that  --  an episode which throws More light on his character than on his politics . Ernst was the third of six sons of a retired Prussian Merchant-marine captain in Kiel . He was born in 1889 in the tiny North Schleswig town of Apenrade , on the Baltic , one of those fringe towns that change hands between Germany and Denmark every time a war is won or lost . It is now Danish . While he was still in short pants , his family moved to Leer , a North Sea harbor town facing the East Frisian Islands . Young radicals often come from archconservative families . Of his dad , Ernst Reuter today still speaks with filial respect : " He was a Prussian of the old ) school , which was not quite so fearsome as a Prussian of the new one . He was a faithful servant of the state and a disciplinarian , a born conservative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in him some of the spirit of 1848 . " Of the six sons , three died during the first World War , a fourth is a Lutheran minister in North Germany , and the fifth , according to Ernst , " was a Nazi before Hitler , a Nazi under Hitler and , what 's more , the swine still is . " Ernst and this older brother have not spoken to each other since 1912 . In his university career , Reuter was brilliant , but no grind . He majored in history and the classics , but did a good bit of reading " under the rug " in political economy . He seems to have spent much of his free time hiking and bicycling around Germany and absorbing a lot of German opera . In 1912 , almost broke , he left the university without the coveted doctorate . His first job was as a private tutor in the classics . But he soon quit to become a newspaper reporter . In 1913 he landed a job in Berlin as instructor in the Social Democratic Party 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plunge into active political life , into a lifetime career . Berlin in 1913 was a citadel of both Prussian militarism and militant pacifism . Reuter naturally fell in with the latter group . He was one of the founders of the League of Human Rights and the Bund Neues Vaterland , two organizations tied in with other European peace groups . World War I was a shock to young idealist Reuter . A still bigger shock came when his own Social Democratic Party voted for the Kaiser 's war credits . Reuter began writing vehement , anonymous diatribes against the foreign policy . The author was soon identified , and promptly drafted into the imperial army . As an infantry private he fought in France in 1915 . Transferred to the Eastern front during the Russian breakthrough in 1916 , he suffered a severe leg wound , was captured and shipped to a PW hospital in Russia . Two years of trench warfare had only intensified his pacifist sentiments . Now , for him , the war was over , and he began to see encouraging signs that the bulk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meanwhile this man of many interests was fascinated by the Russian land and people . On the train to captivity he taught himself the Russian alphabet by studying railroad station signs . In three months he could read Russian , in six months he had mastered the Russian language . After his recovery , he was sent to work in the brown-coal mines near Tula . Here he learned to know the simple Russian worker . Since he was the only one of more than 400 prisoners who had learned Russian , his nightly task in his prison barracks was to read aloud from a Russian newspaper . His fellow prisoners dubbed him their " Reuter Bureau . " Then , in the Russia of late 1917 , came the great event . To weary soldiers on both sides it meant peace . To Private Reuter it was an even more inspiring event  --  the beginning of the great social revolution which would free mankind from war , poverty and all evil . The young German was fascinated by Lenin . He looked around at the great liberating force of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good . To Lenin far off in Petrograd , to Trotsky and Zinoviev already had THE MAYOR RUSSIA HATES ( Continued from Page 27 ) come word of this Russian-spealang German socialist PW . Lenin summoned him . Down the Volga , around Saratov , was a large colony of Germans who had emigrated there in the days of Catherine the Great . Lenin , quickly sizing up Reuter , made him first commissar for the Independent Soviet Republic of the Volga . Henceforth he was to report to the Minister for Nationalities . That minister was Stalin . Reuter saw Lenin several times , Stalin more often . To this day he retains his admiration of the first and his contempt for the latter . He had frequent dealings with Stalin in 1918 . Asked today about his estimate of Stalin , Reuter replies , " He has the mentality of a drill sergeant . " And when you remind him that this , at least , is one rank higher than Hitler 's , he opens his owlish eyes wide and says , " Exactly . " The end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power in German left-wing circles . The German labor movement was split , into three wrangling camps . The Moderates  --  or Majority Social Democrats  --  the Independent Socialists , and the Spartakus Bund of Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg . The Spartakists were soon to become what is now known as the German Communist Party . Back in Berlin Reuter edited the Spartakus Bund 's newspaper , Die Rote Fahne , and in 1921 became general secretary of the newly organized K.P.D. ? German Communist Party . In the German Left of those postwar years , one detects three major issues  --  hotly debated then . They are not without their relevance today : ( 1 ) whether to co-operate with the fledgling Weimar Republic or to go into opposition ; ( 2 ) whether the Russian Bolsheviks had the right to dictate policy to the German Socialists , and ( 3 ) whether events in Russia did not indicate that Lenin 's party , far from bringing about " the withering away of the state , " was in fact instituting an ironclad party dictatorship . Ernst Friesland ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubts . The idea of Lenin as liberator began quickly to fade . In Ernst 's heart he knew that what was now transpiring in Russia should not and could not be transplanted to Germany . When he became general secretary of the party , he had access to papers proving the most blatant Russian interference in internal German affairs  --  always in the Russian national interest ? and the hood dropped from his eyes . Then the K.P.D. , in 1921 , voted to join the Third International . Quietly , Ernst Friesland took a walk . He became Ernst Reuter again , took a job as editor of the S.P.D. Vorwarts and rejoined the Social Democrats . From then until the advent of Hitler , Reuter devoted himself almost exclusively to municipal government . He had been elected to the Berlin City Assembly as early as 1920 . In 1926 he was appointed chief of the **29;3369;TOOLONG department . He fathered the vast transport and housing development which made Berlin , although not the most beautiful , the most modern and Americanized metropolis on the continent . All the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consolidated under city ownership into the B.V.G. ? next to the German Reichabahn , the largest publicly owned utility in Germany . This rapid-transport system in turn enabled the city government  --  with American loans  --  to sponsor huge suburban housing projects for workers and white-collar Berliners . Reuter was the driving force behind these twin projects . From world revolutionary to city father is certainly a step downward as far as adventure is concerned . But to his new job Reuter brought the old enthusiasm . Unlike many members of the Left , he displayed as much skill in the actual business and art , of government as he had in talking about it from the political platform . His reputation grew . In 1930 he was elected to the Reichstag . This period of strictly municipal activity was to serve him well later . During long years of Hitler exile in Turkey , he was to get a job as adviser to the Turkish Government , on civic administration . Today , in Berlin under the air lift , the staggering job of planning for 2,500,000 Berliners under land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more capable hands . Civic problems suddenly have international importance : What is the minimum coal need for public utilities ? Which are the most vital industries ? When the Soviets , in 1947 , challenged his election as mayor on grounds of " lack of competence , " all Berlin roared with laughter . It was like claiming that Babe Ruth did n't know his way around the bases . In 1931 Reuter left Berlin to become mayor of near-by Magdeburg on the Elbe . In 1933 Hitler came to power , and Reuter was one of the first ant i-Nazis to be tossed into Lichtenburg concentration camp . He was sentenced to one year , released under pressure from the Catholic bishop of Magdeburg , tossed again into solitary confinement and released a second time in 1935 on appeal of the London City Council . Hitler at that time was eager to put across the Anglo-German Naval Pact . Twice was enough . This time , Reuter , carrying one small suitcase and with ten reichsmarks in his pocket , slipped across the German-Dutch border and headed for London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered a job by the Turkish Government and set sail for Ankara . How does one survive in a concentra : tion camp ? " In my particular case , ' Reuter recalls , " it was like being in the army all over again . In the German Army a soldier survives , if he is lucky , by looking stupid , saying nothing and obeying every order . And always standing at attention when anybody is watching . I decided , if I was not to go mad , I must imagine myself back in the army again . The Nazis respected anybody who looked stupid enough to make a good soldier . . . and besides , I cleaned the latrines so beautifully ! " The Turkish years were the real eternity . Until he could master that language , he served as adviser to the Turkish Ministry of National Economy  --  Russian had taken him six months to learn , Turkish three years ? then moved over to lecture on municipal administration in a school for senior Turkish officials . Reuter remained in Turkey until 1946 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Berlin to take over the job of American administrator of the Greek-Turkish loan , he sought Ernst Reuter for advice . Said Reuter , " Turkey is a country of proud peasants and corrupt officials ... ? It is a beautiful country , and if the United States can help its people to attain even a mild copy of American constitutional democracy , it is a good fight and a credit to the democratic intentions of the United States . " Reuter in exile looked always homeward . It seemed as if the great day might be coming in September , 1938 ? for hours he sat , in a hotel in Ankara listening to the BBC account of the Munich crisis . When the news of the capitulation of Chamberlain and Daladier came , he exploded . According to Frau Reuter , " Never have I seen ' the fat one ' in such a rage . He grabbed an andiron and bashed in all the venetian blinds in the hotel room . The news depressed him as no news had since Hitler 's seizure of power . " Eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1946 , the fifty-seven-yearold exile stood pensively leaning over a parapet in Istanbul to watch the United States battleship Missouri nose its way up the murky waters of the Bosporus . He mused that if the United States could send battleships to Turkey , it could not be too much longer before they would O.K. his visa to return to Berlin . A few weeks later it came . Reuter returned to Berlin late in 1946 . The great experiment in four-power government was coming apart at the ! earns . Berlin ? the quadripartite island in the Red sea  --  had become as important in defeat as it had ever been in vtcto1y Reuter 's old party , the Social Democrats , had just won a smashing victory at the polls in the first postwar election . The three democratic parties had swamped  --  by 81 per cent  --  the Soviet-sponsored Socialist Unity Party ? read " Communist . " But the Russians quickly all but negated the election results . The Social Democrats stupidly awarded the top city jobmayor  --  to a figurehead , an old party wheel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a pact with the communists . This was where Reuter came in . The democratic parties now demanded a strong man at the top . The City Assembly voted to cashier Ostrowski and elect Reuter . The Soviet , MG Headquarters at Karlshorst threatened to block Reuter 's election at all costs . Nevertheless , With the unanimous su port of the three democratic parties  --  and one communist vote  --  Reuter was elected mayor . The fight had just begun . The Soviets May break their promises , but they always keep their threats . Forcing the is-Sue all the way up to the Allied Control Council for Germany , the Russians , by a Byzantine reading of the Berlin constitution , claimed that any one occupytrtg had an automatic veto over all elected German officials . The Western Powers countered that the removal of such an official should require majority agreement . What were the Soviet objections ? Despite a torrent of accusations and vilification in their puppet press , they could find only three faults in the man : 1 ) Reuter was no real anti-Nazi , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 1932 German passport , and had had it renewed at the German Embassy In Ankara . 2 ) He had lost his claim to German citizenship by being away more than ten years . 3 ) He had given speeches hostile to the Soviet occupying power . Pressed for documentation , Marshal Sokolov-sky produced a speech in which Reuter had said , " Any state which can ascertain with amazing exactitude , a short time after an election , that 99.9 per cent of all votes went to one all-saving party is not a human society but an ant heap . " A member of the American del " obviously observed acidly that this quote obviously referred to the Nazi State , but if the Soviet Marshal wishes to apply it to the U.S.S.R. , we can only marvel at such a confession . " It was now startlingly clear that , despite the Potsdam agreement to foster a democratic growth in Germany , despite the constitution granting free elections , the Russians had no intention of allowing anybody to hold office in Berlin whom they could not dominate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position and agreement to go along with the Rua- " , tans on dropping Reuter , provided they , in turn , agreed to the removal of Ostrowski . A compromise candidate , Lou-Me Schroeder  --  a nice old lady in poor health ? was appointed acting lord Mayor . The kindest thing that can be said about this compromise in the name of " Allied harmony " is that it was the last . Almost everybody was shocked at the boldness of the Russians , except Reuter . The man who had seen many political ups and downs took it philosophically . As a politician , he realized that to be the " elected but unseated " mayor made him more of a popular symbol than ever . It was a title of peculiar honor . Moreover , he knew the Soviet system perhaps better than anybody else in Berlin . To him , what at first appeared a purely Berlin affair was moving inexorably toward a showdown between two worlds . Realist Reuter set out to do battle . While fellow political leaders wondered anxiously whether the Western powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things in the larger framework of the battle for Europe  --  that the Western powers would not evacuate Berlin because in their own best interest they could not . He pointed out that the democracies were relearning the painful lesson that you ca n't do business with dictators by compromising . He vehemently insisted that it was high time for the Germans to be on the side of democracy and history  --  for a change . Quietly , as chief of the traffic and the public-utilities departments , Reuter began preparing for what he called B-Day . In the summer of 1947 he schemed the construction of a huge new power plant ? Kraftwerk West  --  a Western-sector project that will be completed in another few months . He and his colleagues drew up plans for what they knew was coming . When , in June , the air lift was thrown up . Reuter and Company were able to give the Western military governors a precise plan of how to run a city divided against itself , a carefully calculated list of what was needed by air  --  when , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American stake in Berlin ? Why have our policymakers resorted to a fantastically expensive air lift , daily gambling the lives of American pilots to feed this ruined city 116 miles behind the Iron Curtain ? Instinct told them the very fact that the Soviets so eagerly coveted sole possession of the German capital was in itself ominous . The specter of a Red Berlin was a haunting reminder of the butrecently-vanquished Nazi one . And the apostles of appeasement had themselves just been silenced by the shocking Capitulation of Czechoslovakia . These are all good reasons indeed , but they are negative ones . The best positive explanation that this reporter heard , in those early days , came from the lips of Ernst Reuter . We were sitting talking by candlelight , as the planes roared overhead . This jovial man let out a good-natured grunt of satisfaction , played with the stump of a cigar that would never stay lit , and observed , " Airplanes , wonderful . Something you Americans understand so well . But it is unfortunate that it has been called Die Lit ftbriicke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreamed of building a bridge between East and West are over . Here in this Western outpost of Berlin we yearn not for a bridge but a magnet  --  something in the West strong enough to pull Germany together in that direction . " The bridge and the magnet . Wrapped up in this political metaphor is something every German now understands . That Europe today is split is common knowledge . What is sometimes forgotten is that geographically this split runs through the heart of Germany . We call it the Iron Curtain . In the average German , the desire for national unity is almost pathological . When the war 110 ended in 1945 , he heard his new political leaders preaching that Germany could regain her unity if only a bridge could be built between East and West . But events , both in Eastern Germany and in Eastern Europe , proved the ugly truth of Jan Masaryk 's dictum and obituary , " The fate of a bridge is to be walked over . " Whether Ernst Reuter 's magnet can pull down the Iron Curtain remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it is not a mixed metaphor . No sooner had the air lift begun than Reuter turned his attentions west . That July the ministers-president of Western Germany were meeting along the Rhine in conferences to decide whether to accept or reject the London decisions calling for the establishment of a provisional government in Western Germany . Fearful of being charged with " splitting Germany , " eager to help their fellow citizens in Berlin , but afraid of the Russians , the ministers-president began to waver . In the opening sessions they were on the verge of rejecting the three-power plan . When Reuter in Berlin heard of this shilly-shallying , he hopped a plane and came down to Coblenz in the air lift . He got the right to address the gathering in the name of Berlin . Then he let loose with one of the most effective speeches of his long career . The gist of it was this : " The decisions you are hesitating to take here on the Rhine are a matter of life and death to us in Berlin on the Spree . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reality is that the Soviets have already done so . Politics is the art of the possible , and while the London decisions are far from perfect , they give you the opportunity to get something started here in the West . Grasp it . You do n't have to call it a state . Call it X , call it a something , call it a provisional provisorium if you want to . But for God 's sake get it functioning . We in Berlin will fight to join you . The political currents in Europe will then be reversed from East-West to West-East . The magnetic pull of the West will someday pull Berlin and the Eastern zone back into a united Germany . " Reuter 's speech not only brought the assembled ministers-president to their feet to cheer the man from Berlin but it effected a startling change . The seventeen leaders of Western Germany moved to a thumping acceptance of what Reuter had advocated . When , in September , delegates from Western Germany convened in Bonn to get on with the task of framing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixty-three to two  --  to admit a delegation from Berlin as " guests and observers . " This five-man delegation was headed by " Elected but Unseated Oberbiirgermeister " Reuter . Amid the thunderous applause the " air-freight " Berliners marched into the hall . Despite enough official jobs to keep six men busy , Ernst Reuter has managed to spend at least ten days of every month in Bonn , taking part in the deliberations of the constitutional convention . For he realizes that the ultimate resolution of the Berlin question lies there . The air lift is the responsibility of the Western allies . As long as it holds up , so will Berlin morale . But the permanent political liberation of Berlin can come only within the larger German framework . Reuter is out to see that the Western magnet develops pulling power . Reuter 's performance at Coblenz is a tribute to his personality and the political potential of what he is advocating . But it is also a startling commentary on THE SATURDAY the poor caliber of Western German politicians , who should have been able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Western German of national stature who has appeared since the war is Dr. Kurt Schumacher , chieftain of the Social Democrats . But wretched health is cutting him down . The mantle of S.P.D. leadership may well fall to Reuter . He is far and away the most dominant personality on the broader political scene . When and if the Battle of Berlin is won , Reuter 's star will shine brightly in the West . In the warp and woof of a man 's life , if he be a man of any character and worth , one can usually discover some clue , some thread which weaves through the varied pattern of experience . In the career of Reuter , one finds it in a chance remark he tossed off two years ago , the day he arrived back in Berlin . A reporter asked him if he might not have some trouble adjusting himself after ten years ' exile . Reuter smiled and said , " You know , I have been all my life somewhat of an outsider . " Looking backward , one finds this phrase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the black sheep of a conservative Prussian family who left home and never came back . A pacifist , he was caught . up in the Kaiser 's war and loathed it . With Lenin in Russia , he became a revolutionary who soon cast a critical eye on sacred slogans . He was with them , but never completely of them . Back in the Social Democratic Party , he was always treated by the party bureaucrats as a bit too brilliant . Ten years in Turkey . Today his communist opponents refer to him snidely as " The Turk " and " The Exile . " It is significant , however , that never once in Turkey did Reuter , despite official coaxings , consider abandoning his German citizenship . It is this outsider who has brought back to his native land what it so sorely needs . Germany today , with its introverted and smoldering nationalism , looks too much inward upon itself . Reuter sees the problem of Berlin in relation to all of Germany . And he thinks EVENING POST of Germany only in terms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but working with it toward a better future for the world . In his little home in Zehlendorf , a suburb in the American sector of Berlin , Ernst Reuter has gathered round him precious few mementos of the past . One Turkish prayer rug , a battered Russian safhovar , a collection of French berets and some English prints . Here he and Frau Reuter entertain by the light of a gas-pressure lamp . The three Reuter children have been scattered . A daughter remained behind in Ankara . The oldest son is now at Cambridge University and has become a British citizen . A second son is studying at the University of Gottingen . Reuter 's library was looted en route from Ankara to Berlin . Yet enough remains to serve as a mirror of a man 's mind . One would expect weighty tomes on politics and that dismal science , economics . Instead one discovers a classicist 's delight : Greek poetry from Homer to Theocritus ; the works of Vergil in Latin and French ; Thucydides and Plato , Plautus and Catullus ; a handsome English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You Ever Been to Sunny California ? But the real mementos are in the mind 's eye . When one sits and talks to Berlin 's mayor in the blackout , one discovers the real reasons why the West can and must win the Battle of Berlin . Now it is not the fiery , passionate orator who can assemble a larger audience in Berlin than Hitler ever did ; the skillful politician who speaks and understands the four languages of the " quadripartite government " ; the man who will be flying tomorrow to Bonn . Now it is something more important , something too rare on this continent and rarer still in Germany  --  the good European . In a lifetime of struggle , Ernst Reuter has accumulated what strikes this reporter as some real wisdom . But here are verbatim jottings from a recent interview ? let the reader judge : Berlin : " There seems to be an unfortunate impression among the gentlemen of the February 5,19-19 United Nations that the reason for the current impasse is a currency dispute . Nothing could be farther from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not give the Soviets absolute control of issuance , will be acceptable . The one important , the one vital thing is that we have access to the West . Commerce in goods and ideas . If we get that , neither Berlin nor Germany ever go communist . If we get that , It will be the beginning of the end of Soviet plans to bring about a Red Reich . ' Western Germany : " Economic revival and incorporation in the Marshall Plan , well and good . The tying in of Western Germany with Western Europe , a very necessary thing . But let me make one solemn warning which I hope Americans will read . Never be so foolish as to arm Western Germany . The day you do that , you will have lost the moral battle for Europe . One gun in the hands of a West German will solidify Eastern Europe in the Soviet system . They fear an armed Germany , and very rightly so . If the Soviets choose to arm Eastern Germans . let the stigma be theirs . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be very great . I implore you , do n't yield to it . " America and Russia : " You are writing for Americans in I hope you will tell them where we n Berlin stand . But if I may be allowed , let me tell a little story that happened a long time ago . When I was on the PW train going through Russia in 1916 , We had aboard a badly wounded soldier , a Berlin proletarian , desperately in need of food . In a small Russian village , some peasants brought him some steaming kascha ( porridge ) in a wooden bowl with a carved wooden spoon . He was indignant and refused to touch it  --  no metal spoon . " It was a long time before we were able to convince this stalwart German Kultur lover that a different culture is not necessarily an inferior one  --  to look into men 's hearts and not at their spoons . " What I mean is this : It would be a tragedy if the present battle of ideas were to degenerate into an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called Stalinism to become a hatred of a whole people . I know the Russian people . They are a warm and generous and decent people . Where they are backward , they have an eagerness to learn something better . You Americana would not like to be judged by your gangsters . We Germans are not proud of the SS . Do n't mistake Stalin 's cold henchmen for all that there is in Russia . Someday before I die I hope to travel freely to Russia , to sail down the Volga , drop into some peasant cottage , and eat kascha ... with a carved wooden spoon . " The evening I left Ernst Reuter 's house , I wandered downtown toward the center of Berlin . In a German press club I chanced upon a young Red Army major whom I had known well in the pleasanter days of 1945 . When the subject of Reuter came up , the major exploded like a Pravda editorial , " Why do the Americans support this Fascist beast , this warmongering reactionary , this enemy of the Russian people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot kascha , perhaps . But the cold war is a chilling thing , and 1945 was a long time ago . And so , on second thought , I decided I 'd be damned if I would .
