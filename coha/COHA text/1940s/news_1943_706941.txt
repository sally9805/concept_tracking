txt On Nov. 12 , 1938 , the business manager of Local B-9 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers , an A. F. of L. affiliate , filed charges of unfair labor practices with the National Labor Relations Board against the Indiana and Michigan Electric Company of South Bend . The Board held hearings . While the hearings were going on the company 's cables at the South Bend substation were dynamited , its transmission line poles were sawed off , and more than half a dozen of its transmission line towers were dynamited . The Federal Board , however , refused to take cognizance of all this . It upheld the charge that the company was guilty of discouraging membership in Local B-9 . The company asked a rehearing of the case on the ground that an assistant manager of Local B-9 and other members of the union had been arrested and convicted of dynamitings and sentenced to terms of two to fourteen years in the State penitentiary . The Board refused to reopen the case . It was carried to . the Supreme Court . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Speaking for the majority of five , Justice Jackson described the dynamitings in detail . " The process of presenting cases to the National Labor ' Relations Board , " he said , " must be kept free from forces generating bias or intimidation . Dynamiting or display of force by either party has no place in the procedures which lead to reasoned judgment . " This seems a model of understatement . However , three Justices dissented from the mild Court ruling that the Board must reopen the case in order to consider these outrages . The Court minority seems to uphold the strange doctrine that an organization is not responsible for the acts of its agents , even if those acts are performed for its benefit . The fundamental trouble here goes back to the one-sided nature of the Wagner Act itself . That act , let us not forget , deals only with the " unfair labor practices " of employers , never of workers or of unions . It is an unfair labor practice for the employer to " encourage or discourage membership in any labor organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but even through verbal statement . Nothing in the Wagner Act , however , says anything about the use of coercion or even violence on the part of unions . There is not a single word in the Wagner Act to oblige a complaining union to come into court with clean hands . There is not a word in the act to indicate that even the use of dynamiting on the part of unions or union leaders is illegal . There is not a word in the act instructing or authorizing the National Labor Relations Board officially to recognize the existence of dynamiting or any other act of coercion or violence on the part of a union . When this fantastic one-sidedness is pointed out , defenders of the Wagner Act reply that action can be taken against union violence , coercion or sabotage under State laws . This appears to be the position of the Supreme Court minority . But this reply merely emphasizes the one-sidedness and illogicality of the Wagner Act . For what these defenders are saying is that in precisely the same dispute the transgressions of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transgressions of workers or unions
