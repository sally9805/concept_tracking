 | Interesting books on music seem to come along the way you meet interesting acquaintances . For a long time you do n't run into any , but as soon as you meet one , you meet several . So , right now , we have not one but several new and stimulating publications . The first of these is Letters of Composers , an anthology edited by Gertrude Norman and Miriam Lubell Shrifte . I do n't know whether or not you like to read other people 's letters , but they give me an immediate , direct contact with a person and his life that a book written about him seldom does . It 's like hearing a man speak rather than reading his speech . If all letters ? to use Longfellow 's beautiful phrase ? " betray the heart 's deep history , " letters of composers are particularly revealing : with the exception of some of Wagner 's , these letters were written not with an eye to publication , but solely out of the need for communicating thoughts and desires . Though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not an author 's careful product ; they are as unrehearsed as conversation . In reading an anthology that ranges through more than three centuries ( 1603 to 1945 ) and includes a good many modern composers , you get a sense of the continuity of the art , the building of one man 's work on his predecessor 's . It is touching , for example , to read what the old Haydn replied to a man who wanted him to write an opera . He can not , he writes , comply with the wish , because " scarcely any man could ' stand beside the great Mozart . I only wish I could impress on every friend of music , and on great men in particular , the same depth of musical sympathy and profound appreciation of Mozart 's inimitable music that I myself feel and enjoy ; then nations would vie with each other to possess such a jewel within their frontiers . It enrages me to think that the unparalleled Mozart is not yet engaged by some imperial or royal court ! " Then you come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and subjects ! Music , scandal , diplomatic petitions reports of triumphs abroad , and a shower of involved and earthy jokes . I enjoyed particularly his long epistle to his father asking Papa 's permission to get married , because it contains a statement that must have been ancient even when Mozart made it : " I am absolutely convinced that I shall manage better with a wife ( on the same income that I have now ) than I do by myself . " That the two did not live so cheaply as one you find out from a letter written eight years later , in which Mozart pathetically and gently asks a brother Freemason for another loan . " Great God ! I would not wish my worst enemy to be in my present position . And if you , most beloved friend and brother forsake me , we are altogether lost , both my unfortunate and blameless self and my poor sick wife and child .. Oh God ! ? I can hardly bring myself to dispatch this letter ! ? and yet I must ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two letters by Schubert , one at the start of his career when he was twenty-one and when he wrote with bubbling enthusiasm to his best friend ; the other to the same friend ten years later , a week before Schubert 's death : " I am ill . I have had nothing to eat or drink for eleven days now , and can only wander feebly and uncertainly between armchair and bed . Rinna is treating me . If I take any food I can not retain it at all . So please be so good as to come to my aid in this desperate condition with something ti read . I have read Cooper 's Last of the Mohicans , The Spy , and The Pioneers . If by @#  | any chance you have anything else of his . I beg you to leave it for me at the coffeehouse with Frau von Bogner . My brother , who is conscientiousness itself , will bring it over without fail . Or indeed anything else . " What was there , I wonder , in the Leatherstocking Tales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian in his life ? Beethoven is represented by several of his most famous letters . There is the one . written when Beethoven first settled is Vienna , in which he has to admit " that my noblest faculty , my hearing , has greatly deteriorated . " This is followed by his Helligenstadt Testament , written to his brothers a year later , one of the most unbridled . powerful , and tragic self-revelations ever penned . There is a letter to the mysterious " Immortal Beloved , " and a letter to the august Goethe , which asks him to call the favorable attention of the Duke of Weimar to Beethoven 's Missa Solemnis ? a request that was ignored . That composers can be just as dense in their judgment of other people 's work as critics or the public is attested to by let- ters like the one written by Louis Spohr on Wagner 's work . " Imagine , " says he , " the faces Haydn and Mozart would make if they had to listen just once to the hellish noises that now pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving his opinions ? foolish , largely ? of the five national Russian composers and expressing his dislike of Brahms .  | Another important book to which I wish to call your attention is the fourth volume of The Life of Richard Wagner . written by Ernest Newman , the eminent London music critic and probably the most skilful contemporary writer on musical subjects . Mr. Newman has beet . at work for thirteen years on this definitive biography . It is replete with latest information , documents , letters , and references . It is scholarship at its best . But . though the work is exhaustive , it is the very opposite of exhausting . First of all Mr. Newman deals with a subject si complex , such a mixture of good and evi ' . so scintillating and multifaceted , that it is hardly possible to tire of it . Mr. Newnia : writes with impartiality and presentfacts in a way that would have satisfies : Sherlock Holmes . So the biography hasome of the suspense of a detective stor : The entire work is entertaining , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by itself . It deals with the last seventeen . years of Wagner 's life , the crowning period , in which he composed the Meistersinger , finished the music of the Rine. wrote and composed Parsifal , built the Bayreuth theatre , and put on its stage the first festival performances of his works . I can not imagine a better research into the nature of Wagner , who was so tremendous as a musician , but who as a mae held " a court ' every evening , monor - olising most of the conversation . laying down the law on every subject under the sun , favouring the compan- : with long readings from his autobiography ? the manuscript of which he seento have carried about with him everywher for his own satisfaction and the delectation of his friends ? indulging himself - the usual tantrums when crossed , and , a always , alienating and hypnotising h turns everyone who came in contact with him . " O other recent books are entertaining and profitable . First is Fiore , - tan , a biography of Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : reader , this is only hall a book , the fir half , which deals with Schumann 's life and the life of his celebrated wife , ClaWieck . The second half is an analysis Schumann 's music , too detailed an opinionated to be of much help . But the first half is certainly worth reading . The second book is Impresario , ' : S. Hurok . This is a collection of anecdote= and gossip from the personal experience of Mr. Hurok , who may well be the lee : of the old-style impresarios , those gentlemen who wear opera capes , speak with foreign accent , and go bankrupt regularly . Here you will find stories of the bailee Pavlova , Isadora Duncan , Chaliapin , amore recent artists like Marian Andersc Artur Rubinstein , and Jan Peerce . T : - style of the book is rather elementar : but just as nobody is quite so fascinates ' . by celebrities as a celebrity , so is MHurok in a pleasant and wide-eyed dither about his own stars , and he manages t pass on that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
