txt According to the last census there are 184,000 manufacturing plants in the country . Of these 169,000 employ fewer than one hundred workers each and 72 per cent fewer than twenty . The great works in which steel is fabricated , tanks and airplanes are assembled , guns and ships are made , present so dramatic a spectacle of efficient quantity-production that we naturally hear more of them than of the little shops . But when two elderly men in Bay City , Mich. , one the proprietor and the other his employe , can work eighteen hours a day , seven days a week , turn out 18,000 flanges for the Army and win an " E , " it is plain enough that even a very small firm can play its part in winning the war . Probably A. Hadley Williams , who was sent to this country by the British Ministry of Supply , was right in declaring that not until we make the utmost use of our efficient small plants are we likely to exploit our productive ca1 pacity to the full . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to play its part in war production . It is an inexcusable anomaly that one of the largest manufacturing centers of the world should have a problem of unemployment on its hands because most of its industrial work is done in lofts and inconspicuous shops . Because the little manufacturer has been largely forgotten , Congress last May unanimously passed Public Law 603 which created the Smaller War Plants Division within the War Production Board and appropriated $150,000 , - 000 to be expended in buying needed materials and equipment and in meeting payrolls . No precedent was thus established . In England , for example , small works in which fifty or fewer are employed produce 70 per cent of the ammunition . In the North Midland Section , an area of 6,500 square miles , about 2,800 works are busily engaged in filling war contracts . We have no corresponding German figures , but it is common knowledge that every small shop in Germany is working for the Government . So is every farmer , even when he is not tilling the soil . It is not likely that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make large companies subdivide their orders or to demand contracts from procurement agencies . So much still remains to be done that the Division has decided that it is enough to place its technical representatives in the 127 district offices of the WPB and to charge them with the duty of organizing local manufacturers and cataloguing their facilities . Already the Mid-Central War Resources Board , a group of unpretentious firms around Kansas City , has secured contracts from the proper agencies , and already some of the members are flying " E " flags . As yet such instances are few . After all , the Smaller War Plants Division has been in administrative existence only since September , so that we can not expect too much from it before the new year . Apart from the war effort there are good economic reasons why the small factories should be utilized . Unless they receive contracts many will go to the wail . And it they go to the wall we shall hardly be able to cope effectively with the situation that will follow the war . The small industries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Smaller War Plants Division performs its task intelligently .
