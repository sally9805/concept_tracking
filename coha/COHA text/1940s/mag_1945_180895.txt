Platinum-haired , crusading Marshall Field III rode his white charger into the rural South last week . Aiming to make conservative U.S. farmers less sot in their ways , he bought the dingy , drab , 105-year-old Southern Farmer , which circulates 325,000 copies every month through the home districts of many a conservative Southern congressman . As editor and publisher he promptly installed long , lean , leftish Aubrey Williams , whom the Southern senatorial conservatives helped vote down as Rural Electrification Administrator last spring . <P> What Field got for his money ( guesstimated price : $100,000 ) was an old-fashioned print shop in Montgomery , Ala. and an old-fashioned farm journal that loses a nickel on every 25-a-year subscription but makes it all back and more in advertising at $2.50 a column inch . Two of its eight pages are devoted to stodgy editorial matter , the rest to ads , some offering farm equipment , many hawking sex books , love drops , patent medicines . <P> Probable first Field moves : clean up the advertising columns , open the editorial columns to views @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
