<P> From Hong Kong , TIME Correspondent Wilson Fielder cabled : <P> <P> His Excellency the Governor , scanning the sunny skies over Hong Kong , rested his eyes on a reassuring spectacle . A squadron of Spitfires screamed down in mock attack over the blue-green waters of Victoria Harbor . Their target : an aircraft carrier lying at anchor amid a great clutter of cargo junks , sampans and merchant ships from all parts of the world . " If they know we 're strong , " said Sir Alexander Grantham , referring to Hong Kong 's 1,800,000 Chinese , " they 're for us . " <P> The maneuvering Spitfires were not the only show of strength which Great Britain had staged to impress China 's Communists , whose armies had swept up to Hong Kong 's borders . Across the harbor from Hong Kong island , on the flinty , weatherworn mountain of South China 's Kowloon peninsula ( which the British rule under a 99-year lease ) , men of the King 's Shropshire Light Infantry and the King 's Own Scottish Borderers were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brisk regimental commander : " We know our enemy , and we are ready for him . " <P> Delicacy &; Common Sense . This did not mean that the British , who are determined at all cost to carry on trade with Red China , wanted to pick a fight with the Communists if they could possibly avoid it . " We do n't want to provoke the Communists , " said a political adviser to the Hong Kong government . " We are delicately balancing many factors and trying to exercise common sense . " <P> In the 108 years since Britain wrested Hong Kong from the Chinese during the Opium War , the rocky island which the Chinese contemptuously called a " penguin 's nest " has become a traders ' and tourists ' delight . Despite civil war on the mainland and the Nationalist blockade of China 's coast , Hong Kong 's trade this year may reach an alltime high . Daily , British and American ships slip into Hong Kong 's harbor ; nightly , huge motor junks , heavy with Western merchandise , weigh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kong 's population is swollen by refugees from Red China , most of them rich men . Their dollars buy them anything in Hong Kong-Cadillacs , apartments ( for which " key money " frequently runs as high as $2,000 U.S. ) and even Hong Kong birth certificates ( $1,000 and up ) , which would entitle them to British passports and visas to the U.S. <P> Sweethearts &; Five Stars . Communist troops have been as anxious as the British to avoid incidents along the border between the British enclave and Red China , which runs along the main street of Sha-taokok village ( see cut ) . But Communist influence daily makes itself felt in the colony . Through labor unions , the Communists already have a grip on Hong Kong 's light &; power , transportation , docks and its telephone system . A typical crisis arose last week when a young Chinese telephone worker claimed he had been slapped by a British supervisor . The worker 's union threatened to strike unless the supervisor apologized and was fired . After five days ' negotiations , the Briton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most damnable time for something like this to happen , " said a British labor adviser , " most damnable . " Jittery Britons sighed with relief when the damnable incident passed without major trouble .
