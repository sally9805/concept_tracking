RENEGOTIATION <P> Cleveland 's Jack &; Heintz , the Katzenjammer Kids of U.S. industry ( TIME , April 6 , 1942 , et seq. ) were last week playing a new role . Famed for their fantastic bonuses to " associates " ( employes ) , as well as for their bang-up job of turning out plane equipment , they were putting up a noisy fight to hang on to their money . The War Department had ordered their 1942 profits pared by $7,000,000 ( $5,250,000 has already been collected in taxes ) . <P> In the Red . Ebullient , hard-working President William S. Jack flatly stated , in half-page newspaper ads in Manhattan and Cleveland , that this major operation would leave the company $2,826 in the red for the year . He murmured darkly to reporters that the " Roosevelt administration is flirting with revolution , " predicted that soldiers would come home to " the worst mess in the nation 's history " if industry is not left enough funds to provide postwar jobs . Certainly , he affirmed , there would be no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its way . Furthermore , Jack explained that the $75,000 each collected by him and Vice President Ralph M. Heintz had shrunk to $33,000 each after taxes . <P> He added that Jahco had offered to return $1,200,000 of its 1942 profit after taxes and plunk the remainder in a postwar fund . The offer was rejected . <P> In the Black . Under Secretary of War Robert P. Patterson smoothly answered Bill Jack with a barrage of figures . He pointed out that Jahco had started in 1940 with an original investment of $100,000 , boosted this to $354,000 through war profits by the beginning of 1942 . <P> Said Patterson : " The 1942 profit of $8,361,000 ( before taxes ) was over 23 times what the owners had in the business at the beginning of the year and more than 35c on each dollar of sales . It must be remembered that the company 's business is financed principally by the Government . " On Patterson 's figures , Jahco had approximately $375,000 more profit before taxes and renegotiation than was shown in company figuring . <P> Red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who put what in the profit column . Under Secretary Patterson listed as profit $375,000 of the total J. &; H. salaries and other items such as $13,000 for turkeys for nonemployes . Bill Jack listed all this as " expenses , " although the Internal Revenue Department disallowed them . <P> But was $375,000 an adequate profit on $23,000,000 worth of business ? Bill Jack felt sure it was not . In the next few weeks , he plans to plaster the U.S. with ads in 49 newspapers condemning renegotiation and asking for the law 's repeal .
