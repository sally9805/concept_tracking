" There is no use in a fox terrier 's trying to kick an elephant 's teeth out . Any man would be a plain damn fool to come into Kansas City and try to fight the Star . We intend to be the second paper , but we intend to be a profitable second paper . " <P> Speaker was a husky , 55-year-old Irishman named Harry Newman , who last week bobbed up as new publisher-editor of the 87-year-old Kansas City ( Mo . ) Journal . He spoke with apt awareness of the tough competition he is up against . <P> Not since the late great William Rockhill Nelson got the Star on its feet has a second Kansas City paper made money . For the last 20 years particularly the <P> Journal has been a publishers ' booby trap . <P> Clay-tile Tycoon Walter S. Dickey , who bought the Journal in 1921 , bashed in his fortune trying to buck the Star . Utility-man Henry L. Doherty , who bought 50% control in 1931 , sank about $300,000 a year in the Journal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His only profit : whatever satisfaction came from his hysterical series of libel and conspiracy suits totaling $54,000,000 against the Star for its hard-hitting campaign for lower gas rates ( they were thrown out in 1939 ) . <P> Since Doherty ' s death the Journal has been published by " Newspaper Analysts " Orville S. McPherson and Russell H. Miles . Despite livelier makeup and pace , more features , liquor ads ( which the Star refuses ) and New Deal ax-grinding , the Journal has not made the Doherty estate any money , has a circulation of only 80,000 - about a fourth that of the morning or afternoon edition of the Star . <P> Glib Harry Newman is best remembered in Kansas City for his Christmas Reindeer Pageant , staged in 1927 with 1,000 reindeer imported from Alaska as a promotion stunt for the Star . <P> Onetime amateur fighter , itinerant football player ( Ohio Wesleyan , Miami University , Washington &; Jefferson ) , salesman , press agent , insurance executive , promoter of newspaper goodwill , Ohio-born Publisher Newman once published Fourth Estate ( later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president of Columbia Broadcasting System , was the last publisher of defunct Judge . His latest publishing venture was the Senator , a Washington gossip magazine which piled up $84,000 debts in 27 issues in 1939 . <P> Admitting that he had no money to buy the Journal , Harry Newman said only that the capital was put up by " Washington and Kansas City interests . " Best information obtainable in Washington was that the paper had been bought by ex-Ambassador to Russia Joseph Edward Davies ( who may be interested in preserving the Journal as a Democratic mouthpiece ) for $100,000 cash. * Cagily Mr. Davies denied the report , admitted only that he had been approached . <P> * Only about one-third of the Journal 's plant valuation alone , a figure that would net the Doherty estate a satisfactory tax loss .
