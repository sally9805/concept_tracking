Some of them : <P> The Boston Public Latin School 's Joseph Lawrence Powers , 69 , slight , billiard-playing headmaster of the oldest-and possibly the best-U.S. public school ( founded 1635 ) . A strict disciplinarian ( in his best this-hurts-me-worse tone , he used to ask erring pupils , " Why did n't you give me a break so I could give you a break ? " ) , Powers is an old Latin School student himself , has been on the faculty since 1906 . The Powers prescription for scholastic success : hard work on a classical curriculum with a minimum of electives and no frilly courses . <P> The University of North Carolina 's Archibald Henderson , 70 , genial mathematician , historian of the South , drama critic , biographer , friend of Mark Twain and George Bernard Shaw . Henderson bought ink by the quart for his own use , once turned out five books in one year ( " When I get tired , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advice to students : " The university offers you , not education , but only the pursuit of education-forever and ever . " <P> The University of California 's Max Radin , 68 , law teacher , Brandeisian philosopher and historian of the law , biographer of Marcus Brutus , indefatigable author of legal books and articles ( a WPA project was once assigned to catalogue them all ) .

( for Clara ) Mildred Thompson , 66 , starchy , pince-nezed dean ( for 25 years ) , " map-minded " history professor , U.S. delegate to the conference that founded UNESCO , outspoken feminist , internationalist and F.D.R. Democrat . More respected than beloved , Atlanta-born Dean Thompson briskly shook hands on registration day with every new Vassar girl , thereafter kept a cold eye on grades and credits until commencement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graphic-arts professor and " Printer to Yale University " since 1920 . Harvardman Rollins overhauled all of Yale 's printing , from library cards to diplomas , designed more than 2,000 handsome books , won the gold medal of the American Institute of Graphic Arts ( his favorite type face : Caslon old style ) . <P> Harvard 's Paul Joseph Sachs , 69 , harddriving , roly-poly art historian , collector of prints and drawings , and longtime associate director of Harvard 's famed Fogg Museum of Art . A onetime partner in the banking firm of Goldman , Sachs &; Co. , well-to-do Professor Sachs made Fogg the No. 1 training school for U.S. museum curators and directors . <P> <P> The University of Wisconsin 's Frederic Austin Ogg , 70 , tall , shy political scientist , co-author of the widely used Ogg &; Ray textbooks on government ( total sales : 1,500,000 copies ) , longtime managing editor of the American Political Science Review , a faculty member for 34 years .                @ @ @ @ @
