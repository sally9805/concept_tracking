Oh , Stop That , Freda ! lly WARNER OLIVIER M OBODY today really knows what a liberal is , but almost anybody would agree that Freda Kirchwey , editor and publisher of The Nation , America 's oldest and one of the world 's foremost liberal weeklies , is one . In an era when bobbed hair was a rarity in the United States and an issue of passionate public debate , Miss Kirchwey , a Nation fledgling , attending a midwinter staff house party in Connecticut , found that hairpins must be shared with the wind when one was coasting on a sled . With the help of other ladies of The Nation staff , she promptly cot her hair short , realizing that her family might be horrified when they saw her . They were , none of them so much as her small son , Michael , who threw himself on the floor , sobbing bitterly that he would n't look at her again . " I 'm ashamed , " he reproached her specifically , " to have a mother who shows her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Freda  --  in private life Mrs. Evans Clark  --  was not daunted . Nor has she ever been . In the twenty-odd intervening years , Miss Kirchwey has gone on showing her ears , ideologically as well as actually . They are good ears , any way you take them , and in this beclouded political day , when there are as many definitions of liberal as there are definers , you might do worse than settle for the specification that a liberal is a person who shows his ears . Last year , on the occasion of her twenty-fifth anniversary with The Nation , Miss Kirchwey received a tribute which few , if any , editors have ever received . With Raymond Swing , an old National associate , as toastmaster , 1300 persons , many of them celebrities from this country and abroad , attended a dinner in her honor in New York and presented her $25,000 for the magazine  --  a tribute to what her friends call her own and The Nation 's unrelenting fight for democracy at home and abroad , and permanent peace for the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to consult with Miss Kirchwey and her associates . But The Nation staff knows no protocol . If you mall up and ask to speak to Miss Kirchwey , you may hear-the telephone operator asking somebody , " Where did Freda go ? " The gay camaraderie behind the scenes is inconsistent with the gravity of the magazine when it gets up into its liberal pulpit and begins to admonish those whom it regards as the bad boys of democracy or truants from the democratic reservation . Freda Kirchwey did n't originate this democratic office spirit , for it began under her predecessor , Oswald Garrison Villard . But she had a hand in its beginnings and her personality and sparkling humor would have a crumpling effect on the stiffest stuffed shirt . " Freda is a gay crusader who takes an adventurous attitude toward everything , " says Joseph Wood Krutch , The Nation 's dramatic critic and a longtime associate . " She is a natural-born Bohemian and would undoubtedly be talking to people over cocktails about the state of the world every day of her life , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Freda  --  baptized-Mary Fredericka  --  is one of four children of the late Dr. George W. Kirchwey , who was dean of the Law School of Columbia University . Dorothy Canfield Fisher recalls an occasion when she lunched with the Kirchwey family . " After lunch , " she said , " we heard a scuffle upstairs . Dean Kirchwey stepped to the bottom of the stairs and called up , ' Oh , stop that , Freda ! ' We asked him how he knew ' which , ' and he said , with an indulgent smile , ' It 's always Freda when there 's anything doing , ' " Today , with Miss Kirchwey as the head and spirit of the magazine with which she has been associated for twenty-six years , countless public servants in Washington and in capitals throughout the world who have been on the receiving end of The Nation 's editorial hairbrush would give five years oft their political lives if they knew some effective way of shouting upstairs , " Oh , stop that , Freda ! " Freda Kirchwey started crusading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school she first met the ugly evil of racial discrimination and began a fight against it which she has never ceased to wage . Her first job , during a summer vacation from Barnard College , was driving a Model T through Connecticut to make speeches for the Connecticut Woman 's Suffrage Association . The family used to chuckle over Freda 's letters describing her reception by the uneasy Connecticut citizenry . She organized suffrage parades in college and her sense of humor did not deter , and probably abetted , her in leading one of these processiOns of protest riding a white horse with the aplomb of a Jeanne d'Arc , clad in a white cheesecloth robe dangling outside khaki riding breeches . As a commencement speaker on her graduation from Barnard , the women 's college of Columbia University , Freda put the blast on Columbia for its failure to admit women to the law school of which her father was dean . Dr. Nicholas Murray Butler , president of the university , sitting in the front row , buried his head in his hands . Freda came by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberal , a long-time friend of Theodore Roosevelt , and independence of thought was virtually a religion to him . Doctor Kirchwey had an incisive mind , his friends say , and an amaz- ? ing capacity for humor . His main interest lay in prison reform , and for two years while on leave from Columbia he was warden of Sing Sing prison , where he and his family befriended many of the prisoners . Nicky Arno was their butler . For years after Freda went to The Nation , there was a fairly constant procession of bankrupt Sing Sing alumni who called upon her and pleaded their long friendship with her father to make successful touches . Freda was the third of four children . Her older brother , Karl , a lawyer , died two years ago . Her sister , Dorothy , is married to La Rue Brown , a Boston attorney , now assistant to Ambassador Winant in London . A younger brother , George W. Kirchwey , Jr , , died as a child , " We never sat down to a meal where there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mrs. Brown recalls . " My revolutionist GrandfatherKirchwey , who came from Germany as a ' Fortyeighter ' , or Grosepapa , as we called him , and Gross-mama , also German born , lived with us . Then there was Grandmother Wendell , my mother 's mother , the widow of a Methodist minister in Albany ; our Great-aunt Barbara , the traditional Victorian aunt who was a saint to the children and generally eased the running of our big household ; my father 's two sisters , Tante Clara and Tante Mary , who taught at the Horace Mann School ; mother and father , four children and two maids whom a professor 's salary was stretched to include . " At Barnard , Freda was voted by her classmates " the most beautiful " and " the most likely to succeed . " Both verdicts of her college peers have panned out remarkably well , for , nearing fifty-two , she is a strikingly beautiful woman . From the age of sixteen , Freda had numerous beaux , but they were merely beaux until she met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Columbia . Shortly after Freda 's graduation , they were married by contract at the Kirchwey home . Justice Samuel Greenbaum , of the New York State Supreme Court , witnessed the contract and Doctor Kirchwey read Edward Carpenter , a Whitmanesque English reformer and poet . In that day-1915 ? contract marriages , generally thought to be as heinous as they were godless , were a stirring national issue . The newspapers carried stories about the wedding , and when the Clarks shortly afterward moved to Princeton , where Evans had accepted a job as instructor in politics , the unbeseetning phenomenon of a contractually wed couple living in their midst stirred popeyed speculation among staid Princetonians . Freda , commuting daily to a job on the Morning Telegraph in New York , one day overheard two Princeton ladies , who did n't know her by sight , discussing the situation . " I 've heard , " said Lady No. 1 , " that she does n't live with him at all and they 're not really married . " 23 " Well , " said Lady No. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really married , too , but she does spend week ends with him ! " " It 's a very queer situation , " Lady No. 1 summed it up darkly . In her first writing job on the Morning Telegraph , devoted largely to racing and Broadway , Freda was supposed to do stories from " the woman 's angle , " besides covering general news . For one half-page spread she was A DEBUTANTE IN WALL STREET who VIEWS THE WORKERS AND THE WORKINGS OF THE PLACE . She covered the convention of the American Federation of Goldfish Fanciers when resolutions were passed denouncing glass bowls , and asserting that goldfish should only be kept in bathtubs , and calling upon legislatures to abolish the " manifold cruelties " to goldfish all over the country . It was the opinion of the dietitians among this group that oysters on the half shell were admissible as goldfish diet if served sparingly , but that a staple item in the diet should be small Japanese shrimp . Then there was the interview with Mrs. Emilie Welton , the theosophist , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Mrs. Welton , who must have been a Californian , the fairies were golden , but in the Dakotas they were black and white . This was perfect training for one who was later to view the political scene with critical and appraising eye . Freda spent a year with the Morning Telegraph and another year with Bruce Barton 's Every Week before she went to The Nation . Few Americans who lived through the decade which began about the close of the last World War can refrain from occasional backward and nostalgic . glances . Those were delightfully zany years and a good time was had by all . But it was a shameful American decade too  --  a decade of racing heedlessly toward an economic precipice , a decade of bankrupt political parties , stock bonanzas and gang warfare . When even these few of its sins are set down on paper , it sounds like a wicked little piece of history , and it was . But , like Edna Millay 's candle prodigally burning at both ends , it gave a lovely light . The early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a catharsis . Mencken and Nathan were leading  --  or seemed to be , in that light  --  a revolt against shibboleths and hypocritical mores . Babbitt stood on the threshold of the language . In art schools in Chicago and St. Louis and San Francisco , young students wrangled endlessly and healthily . In Baltimore , young reporters let routine assignments wait while they heatedly discussed over breakfast coffee the suppression of Cabell 's Jurgen in Boston . In Philadelphia the same sort of young reporters roundly denounced The Saturday Evening Post for buying and destroying the souls of promising writers , though a few renegades could he heard muttering sotto owe that they wished the Post could be induced to cast a covetous glance at their souls . The Nation was the Bible of a large group of fighting and articulate liberals . The New Republic had its own following , but in those days it had fallen under the opprobrium of being " pink . " Liberals with whom you did n't agree were usually called " pinks , " or " parlor pinks " if you wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eve of this decade that Oswald Garrison Villard launched his revivified Nation to engage in grave and beautifully written brawling with statesmen of this country and the world . The Nation had been founded in 1865 , at the close of the Civil War , by Edwin Lawrence Godkin , partly with Quaker financial backing and largely for the purpose of championing the rights of the newly freed slaves . But Godkin 's political interests were broad and with Wendell Phillips Garrison , son of the Abolitionist leader , William Lloyd Garrison , as his editorial associate , Godkin soon made The Nation the foremost review and probably the most feared editorial voice in the country . Charles Dudley Warner spoke of it with respect as " the Weekly Judgment Day , " In 1881 , The Nation and The New York Post were bought by Henry Villard , railroad builder , and his wife , Fanny Garrison Villard , who was the daughter of the Abolitionist leader . Godkin went to the Evening Post , and Mrs. Villard 's brother continued in charge of The Nation . Garrison gave up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largely est a literary weekly supplement to the Post . In 1918 the Post was sold by Oswald Garrison Villard to a group including Thomas Lamont , while he kept The Nation and became its editor . For his new Nation , Mr. Villard , who was the son of Henry and Fanny Villard , assembled a brilliant , eager and for the most part youthful staff . To Lewis S. Gannett , now literary critic of the New York Herald-Tribune , it seemed a " journalistic heaven " when he returned from France in the fall of 1919 . Besides Mr. Gannett , there were at one time or another four Van Dorens on the staff , Carl , Mark , Irita and Dorothy  --  all of whom except Dorothy filled the post of literary editor  --  Ludwig Lewisohn , the genial and brilliant Joseph Wood Krutch , Norman Thomas , Lincoln Colcord , George Soule , Raymond Swing , John Macy , Albert Jay Nock , Arthur Warner , Henry Mnsany , William MacDonald , Ernest Gruening , Henry Hazlitt and the well-loved Papa Schumm , who made proofreading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politically approved . Mr. Villard was the boss and the moving spirit of the magazine , but he used a light rein and he was usually open to conviction by his juniors , though they could not convert him from being a prohibitionist . " When , in 1922 , the staff celebrated his fiftieth birthday , " Mr. Gannett said , " it seemed to many of us that he was a phenomenally well-preserved old man . Among ourselves , we said we admired him because he had bad the courage to change his views on so many questions after reaching the hale old age of forty , when most men 's minds were crusted , but when we tried to suggest that to our chief , he would thunder that he had never wavered from the true Godkin-Garrison-Villard tradition . " ( Continuer. , front Page 98 ) Morally and socially conservative , Mr. Villard was frequently shocked by staff carryings-on , and the staff loved to tease him . Nor was he a Lucy Stoner at heart . Freda Kirchwey had lost , her first two children . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Nation virtually up to the eleventh hour , walking daily to the office across the bridge from Brooklyn , where she was then living . Mr. Villard during this period used to introduce her to strangers by saying , " This is Miss Kirchwey , but she is really Mrs. Evans Clark . " On one occasion , during a trip by Mr. Villard to the West , homeless people were walking the streets of New York , and The Nation blazed out with an editorial by the elderly and usually austere William MacDonald headed ; SEIZE EVERY EMPTY HOUSE ! Mr. Villard was profoundly shocked and disturbed when he saw this , since be owned  --  as everyone on The Nation perfectly well knew  --  a large and quite empty house in New York . With a gay , irreverent , starry-eyed stall , The Nation was casting political devils out of the world with almost every issue . It was saving Haiti week after week , getting the marines out of Nicaragua , railing at imperialism , denouncing lush villainy in Washington , helping to launch the Irish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The warpath to a better world lay straight through the editorial rooms , and no one ever laid down his cudgels . In this milieu Freda Kirchwey was a lovely duckling paddling happily in choppy ideological waters . Her first Nation job was clipping foreign exchanges for the International Relations Section , but within a year , at twenty-five , she had been made an associate editor and was writing incisive and coolly telling editorials on Irish freedom , on India , and a myriad of national and international problems . " It would take Freda all day to wind up , " says I rita Van Doren , now editor of The New York Herald-Tribune 's Sunday literary section , Books . " She would talk or read or sit around most of the day before she could get to her writing . But she never held up an edition . " It is a luxury to publish liberal weeklies in the United States , for their annual deficits are only slightly less sure than death and taxes . Though twenty-odd million persons voted for Mr. Roosevelt , the relatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its peak , has only 42,700 circulation . That does n't appeal to advertisers , regardless of their political faith . What little advertising the magazine carries  --  it rarely runs over five or six pages an issue  --  is for books of the economic or political type , a few theaters and resorts , and miscellaneous classified items . In addition , both the Bell Telephone System and the General Electric Company take regular full-page institutional ads , a circumstance which Mr. Villard confessed he never was able to understand . When Mr. Villard , in 1918 , gave The Nation a shot in the arm , he hired a comparatively large staff . His loss the first year was $100,000 , paid out of his own pocket . Retrenchment was essential if The Nation was to continue , and he did succeed in cutting his costs and his losses . But while he was publisher , deficits were never less than $5000 to $10,000 , and usually were far greater . Part of these sums Mr. Villard paid and part was subscribed by personal friends who wished to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ editor and publisher . Staff salaries , then as now , were small , the top being about $5000 . Deficits never frightened Mr. Villard , nor did he allow them seriously to threaten any projects be wanted The Nation to undertake . But it gave him a sense of publishing piety to make trifling economies . At one period he appointed Mr. Gannett , whom he regarded as his heir apparent , to act . as watchdog of the treasury . Mr. Gannett took the assignment seriously and worked hard effecting small economies , only to have the boss suddenly come up with a grandiose scheme which would swallow at a gulp all the carefully accumulated savings . " I think we had better send Joe Krutch to Moscow to ' report on the theater there , " Mr. Villard would say , for example . When Mr. Gannett would protest that this would be an expensive venture ; the boss , looking a little hurt , would say that he foresaw " no difficulty in persuading the board of directors that Nation readers should be kept informed of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directors , possibly because they were Nation readers themselves , always acquiesced to these quixotic proposals , and Mr. Gannett and his successors could only wring their burnt hands and try again under Mr. Villard'sever-watchful eye to effect their little economies . That was in the financially swashbuckling 20 's when money was spent as recklessly as it was made . It was n't greatly difficult to get money for any cause . But with the coming of the sober , aackclothed and ashen 30 's , the visible supply of rich men willing to contribute to liberal causes had dwindled remarkably . It was in 1932 that Maurice Wertheim , who had been a backer of Mr. Villard 's Nation , asked himself why he should continue to meet deficits for another man 's magazine . Mr. Wertheim , founder of Wertheim &; Co. , investment bankers , offered to take over the magazine , assuming financial responsibility for it , and to place its editorial management in the hands of the staff . Mr. Villard agreed , and The Nation was sold for $25,000 to the Civic Aid Foundation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Control of the editorial policy was placed in the hands of Freda Kirchwey , Joseph Wood Krutch , The Nation 's dramatic critic for many years , and Raymond Swing . Later Mr. Swing moved into his chosen field of radio comment and Max Lerner was brought by Mr. Wertheim to The Nation from Harvard , where he was a professor of government . Wertheim put additional money into the magazine to improve its format and promotion , and circulation climbed . Numerous persons wished to buy The Nation for various reasons , not all of them to promote the cause of liberalism . But Wertheim told Freda Kirchwey that he wanted her to buy and edit the magazine , since she had been a member of its staff for twenty years and had played a large part in shaping its policies . Con nod from Page Joe ) " Buy it with what ? " she wanted to know . She could have it , he said , for $15,000 in cash , and he would hold a note for $15,000 . Freda went home and talked the matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Twentieth Century Fund . They are not people of wealth . They could put up $15,000 , but not meet annual deficits , and Freda had a great distaste for asking for outside contributions . She thought it might be possible to keep The Nation out of the red by cutting coats and salaries . The staff had volunteered to accept cuts in its desire to see her take over the magazine . After pious and prolonged figuring , the Clarke decided to take a chance . Financially , it was a courageous thing to do . Editorially , Miss Kirchwey was prepared to be even more courageous , for the policies she instituted as editor and owner of The Nation would inevitably , as she knew , alienate large blocs of Nation readers . The historic role of The Nation had been that , since wars had never resulted in good , this country should attend strictly to its own business and insulate itself from foreign affairs . Miss Kirchwey , in her earlier Nation days , had herself adhered largely to this doctrine . She had felt that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise of Fascism cast for her a more revelatory if sinister light on international affairs . She believed that in Mein Kampf Hitler had laid his cards on the table and meant to play them exactly as he said he would . Technology had shrunk the world and brought every continent , ours included , within a fatal stone 's throw of every other continent . In this new and smaller world , she believed that the only security was collective security . The Spanish civil war , she insisted . was Fascism 's pilot-plant experiment for world conquest and , unless drastic action was taken by the democracies , she foresaw the Nazi-Fascist war sinews hardening and tautenng . The Nation was decried as a warmonger when it fought vainly for help to Spain 's Loyalist government , for the lifting of the embargo on arms to the desperately beleaguered Spanish Republicans , for collective action to brake Japan 's aggression in China . Editorially , it made dire prophecy after dire prophecy of things to come if we and other democracies failed to act , and dire prophecy after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of Nation readers found the new policy galling . Many of these were pacifists and many were merely liberals who believed that another imperialist war was in the offing , that collective security was an idealist 's will-o ' - the- wisp , and that our role , whatever might happen elsewhere , was to preserve an oasis of democracy here at home . The spokesman for this group in The Nation was Mr. Villard , who continued to write his column , Issues and Men . But in 1940 he withdrew the column and ended his long connection with The Nation . Many old Nation readers left with him . Under Miss Kircbwey 's regime , The Nation has been almost constantly at war with the State Department over the question of appeasement . It bitterly criticized the entente with Vichy , the official blessing given to Darien and Badoglio and what it regarded as the coddling of Franco . It was not impressed with the argument that all this appeasement was necessary because of military expediency and resulted in the saving of American lives . Such a program , The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World War III , which , if it came , would take more American lives . The result of The Nation 's policy of not appeasing readers began to show almost immediately in a fall in circulation . The 1936-37 average was 39,000 , but by 1942 it was down to 30,000 , partly due to cutting off field-agency business . And then began a steady rise : 34,600 in 1943 , 38,000 in 1944 , 42,700 for the first six months of 1945 ? an all-time high . There were two years without deficits after Miss Kirchwey took over , 1938 and 1939 , but in other years there were slight deficits . Miss Kirchwey consulted with Hugo Van Arx , The Nation 's business manager . They concluded that no further cutting of costs was possible , and it was then decided to appeal to readers and friends of The Nation to contribute to its support . To implement this plan , The Nation Associates , a nonprofit membership corporation modeled on the group known as the Survey Associates , which publishes the Survey Graphic , was organized in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the associates , washing out for good the $15,000 she had invested , and Mr. Wertheim canceled the note which he held . Others who had lent money to The Nation did the same thing so that the new association could start free of debt . The first public appeal for funds was successful far beyond expectation . A total of $32,861 poured into The Nation offices in contributions from one dollar up . They came from people in every walk of life  --  ministers , professors , laborers , industrialists  --  from Republicans and Democrats and Socialists , even from Communists , whom The Nation has always fought . Most of the checks were accompanied by letters . The first paper I subscribed for after coming to Emporia and buying the Gazette , " wrote the late William Allen White , a Nation contributor , " was The Nation . And it has been a thorn in the flesh ever since . I and my kind have needed it , and I think it has done its job well . " Miss Kirchwey is the president and Miss Lillie Schultz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Miss Schultz and an advisory council which includes many distinguished persons in various fields , the associates have undertaken an extensive program to further public acceptance of The Nation 's policies in the international and domestic fields . A national forum , a regular radio program , regional conferences and greatly increased foreign and American coverage for The Nation are included in plans of the associates . Formation of the associates also made possible the establishment of the widely influential Political War Section of the magazine , edited by J. Alvarez del Vayo , who was foreign minister of Spain in the Negrin government . Salary cuts on the magazine have been restored . Freda Kirchwey is a working editor as well as a publisher . Her job is a seven-days-a-week job , partly , no doubt , because she likes to gab . " Freda has an exuberant sense of fun , " says Mr. ! Crutch , " and nothing interests her so much as talking with people who can tell her about things she is interested in . She is a prodigiously hard worker , but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She is always in a flutter , and never finishes anything in less than three times the amount of time she has assigned to it . " " In some cases , respect for an editor ends at the office door  --  it is all outside , " says Margaret Marshall , The Nation 's literary editor . " Freda Kirchwey 's moat enthusiastic and loyal supporters are the people who work in The Nation office . A Nation editorial conference is a free-for-all where everyone says what he thinks . Needless to say , there is general agreement on basic issues , but within this frame there are disagreements , some of them long-drawn-out . What keeps a Nation editor from resigning , in such instances , is the knowledge that he can express his own opinion , over his own name , and that the majority opinion is an honest one , honestly arrived at . " Miss Kirchwey has no Lucy Stone convictions . Professionally , she is Miss Kirchwey , and at home she is Mrs. Clark .

She is an excellent cook when she has the time to be , but she never gets home before seven o'clock , and then brings with her a case of manuscripts to be read before morning . A detective story  --  often in the bathtub  --  finishes her day 's reading . Her editorials are written over the week ends , which , in the summer , are spent near East Hampton , where the Clarks , both veteran sailors , keep a yawl in Three Mile Harbor . For a month each year they spend most of their time on the water . Their son , Lt. Michael Kirchwey Clark , served with the French army during the war . He was torpedoed on the Zarn Zam . Evans Clark , also deeply interested in social and economic problems , for the last sixteen years has been executive director of the Twentieth Century Fund , which sponsors research and public education in the field of economic problems .

Whenever there is a three-alarm fire , it comes in over the . telephone to the Clark apartment on Washington Square , and off he goes , usually in the middle of the night , for that is when most big fires occur . Freda sometimes accompanies him to fires , but not often . " A policeman once warned me not to marry Evans , " she recalls . " We were engaged at the time , and it was a very windy night and I was waiting around outside the fire lines . The policeman said that life with a buff would always be that way . " The Clarks regard each other humorously , but with immense respect . // " Freda is a great joiner when a cause is involved , " her husband says , smiling . " Since the war started , I do n't know how many committees she has been on . She has done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feminine foibles . No matter how full her ached ule , ' she keeps a weekly appointment with a hairdresser to whom she has gone for years . She dresses well and expensively , because she has n't the time to look around for less costly things which might be becoming . " Last year , when Freda was the guest of honor at a dinner of thirteen hundred people celebrating her twenty-fifth anniversary on The Nation , she decided she must have a new dress for the occasion , " her sister said . " She went into a shop and asked for a plain black dress , and spent ten minutes choosing one and having it pinned to fit her . She took it home , and while she worked on her speech , I sewed the dress . The finishing touches were beyond either of us , so Freda appeared at the dinner in a smart dinner dress which I had sewed her into just before she left home .

Her own prose is direct and lean , but frequently sparkling . She is as careful of spending words as a haggling French bonne with her sous at the market , but she gets her words ' worth in every sentence . Freda Kirchwey has modified some of her views , but not many , since she was a kid starting to work for The Nation in 19l9 . The Nation has changed its mind  --  in many cases completely  --  since it was a kid . Today , for example , The Nation of Godkin 's time would certainly be called antilabor , for in the movement for the eight-hour day it saw Communism and predicted that if the movement was successful grass would " grow in Broadway .

A little left of center is not a fixed point , because center itself does not stand still .
