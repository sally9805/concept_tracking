txt English Calm Under Shadow Awaiting Attack , They Are Certain of Victory , Visitor Here Says To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I do not think I have ever read anything so calculated to bring a lump to English throats as your recent editorial , " Twelve o'Clock . " Every time I hear that bombers have been " over Southeast England " I think back to my little home among the Kent woods , not far from Hever Castle , where Anne Boleyn was born , and where Major Astor , son of American-born Lord Astor , now lives  --  plus many mothers and children evacuated from London 's poorer districts . But may I say that there is a tendency for you in New York , as in America generally , to over-emphasize the gloom cast by the shadow over England . This is natural . First of all , troubles always look worse when you are an onlooker . Secondly , the English character is different from the American , both in its virtues and its defects . The Englishman is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hence he does not speculate so much on the terrors to come  --  with the result that he worries less about that which does not happen , for we know that the worst imaginings seldom are realized . I arrived in England about the time of the fall of France . Honestly , you might have thought the war was in California . To say that the British are confident is to understate the case . They just are certain . I do n't think there is any nation so certain in the whole world at this moment . There is no argument . Every one seems to know what the other fellow thinks as by instinct . I definitely noted this trait in my fellow-countrymen in these last few weeks . To illustrate the unbelievable attitude of fortitude , let me quote the case of the Essex farmer whose farm was bombed one night recently . A 500-pound bomb had fallen across the road into the field opposite , leaving a crater big enough to put a house in , and removing every pane of glass from his house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only comment next day when visited by a friend of mine was : " Well , I always wanted a pond in that field , and now I 've got one . " However , such stoicism does not alter the fact that there is a shadow over England , nor does it lessen the appreciation which I personally feel for your editorial , which I hope will be reproduced in London . FRANCIS J. MOTT . New York , July 30 , 1940 . The Cathedral of Beauvais Some Facts About Unharmed Edifice in Ruined French Town To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The picture of the Cathedral of Beauvais published in THE NEW YORK TIMES of July 23 over a partly erroneous inscription means exciting news and deeply felt relief to those who fully realize its significance . The cathedral , situated in a small and unimportant French provincial town , although little known and nearly forgotten , is one of the marvels of the world . The eye of the tourist traveling east from beautiful old Rouen over the fertile plains of Northern France is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The traveler sees no town , no church steeples . Nearer and nearer he gets to the mysterious object , but only after a ride of more than an hour he recognizes the building . It is a huge Gothic cathedral , in size and height perhaps one of the largest ever built , contrastingly surrounded by low one and two story houses of a quiet village . On foundations laid in 949 the church was erected in its present form during the thirteenth- and fourteenth centuries . And now to the error in the text : " The ruins of Beauvais as seen from the tower of an unharmed cathedral . " The Cathedral of Beauvais never possessed a tower and no tower had been planned  --  except a so-called " fleche " in the middle of the roof , which collapsed in 1573 in a terrible catastrophe . Instead of towers  --  and that is the marvelous part  --  the cathedral as a whole is built as high as towers might have been . In a time when steel construction and cement were unknown this fantastic church was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arch to an interior height of 160 feet . The overwhelming beauty of these Gothic pillars striving , upward in a smooth and elegant line to join in pointed arches crowning the choir at a height never again achieved in Gothic buildings can not be described and can hardly be recalled by the imagination even of those who once stood awed on the large pavement stones of the crosswalk . May all this beauty further be saved for admiration and worship by future generations ! WALTER VON FELDAU . New York , July 27 , 1940 . Faulty Air-Conditioning To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I wish that a list of restaurants and movie houses that are not chilled to the refrigerator point might be presented to the public . There are innumerable sensitive young and old persons who simply can not enter these places . The number of cases of colds , severe sinus attacks and even pleurisy is very considerable . Are there no places in the city where those who would rather be too warm than get chilled and resultingly ill may go and be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have suffered from the badly controlled air conditioning of railroad cars , and I have encountered many trainmen who themselves complain . SENSITIVE . New York , July 30 , 1940 . Some Inconsistency Seen To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Under the repeatedly stated and apparently generally approved policy of " all possible material aid to Great Britain short of war , " we are selling to Great Britain for cash on delivery in the United States such materials as Great Britain will pay for and carry away in her own ships . Thereby we risk nothing and profit much . Can it be possible that the United States Government is now seriously pro .. posing to give and even deliver free $50,000,000 worth of food and - other supplies to those parts of Europe now controlled by Hitler , against whom one of Great Britain 's most potent weapons is starvation ? Every sensible person will realize that these supplies will inevitably help Hitler directly or indirectly . Are we willing to put ourselves in the position of asking Great Britain to help us comfort her enemies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? This is emotionalism disguised as humanitarianism . ELIZABETH LINDSAY . Mill Neck , N. Y. , July 28 , 1940 . Regard for Grass Resented Resident of Riverside Drive Believes Humans Should Come First To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : As a resident of Riverside Drive I have occasion to use Riverside Park ; which means that , quite regularly , I get chased out of the park because of some ordinance which says that the unfeathered biped may not sit in the cool shade of either elm or oak . This is very sad , and I would like to call Mr. Moses ' attention to the inadequacy of the shaded seating capacity in Riverside Park . When one is chased off the grass , one is literally chased out of the park . For there are very few other places to sit . Whoever placed the concrete seats labored under the delusion that it is simply grand to sit in the broiling sun , and that the human heart rejoices in looking at cool shade but never sitting in it . This is interesting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I observe , for example , that , whenever I go into Riverside Park , the grass is littered with happy humanity . The happiness is only momentary , for soon the police come along and command the removal of all human traces from the patterned beauty of mottled shade and grass . Humanity seems to offend the police , who , evidently , are more conscious of park ordinances than the joy of gamboling children , or the serene relaxation of adults who seem happy to be so close to mother earth . But what is really more important ? that the grass die in supporting our sense of beauty , or our sense of beauty die so that the grass may live ? Can the injured soul  --  and the park police certainly injure it  --  be compared to injured grass ? And what is all this talk about integrating youth with healthful activities , if the most healthful of all is denied it ? We may not have a legal right to sit under a tree in Riverside Park , but I claim one on grounds more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's immemorial pantheism ; his deepseated , organic need to feel the grass under his sweltering body ; his hunger for the Antean quality of earth . That is why , five minutes after the police have gone through , everybody is back on the lawns , in spite of the ordinance against it . Why should n't the park authorities recognize this fact and open some lawns in Riverside Park , as they do in Central Park ? The weather and the general conditions of the times require a shady respite for that unfeathered biped who can no longer fly into the tree itself . PHILIP GINNETTI . New York , July 29 , 1940 . Enterprising Youngsters Need Help To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I hope some of your readers will be interested in helping 180 youngsters at the Colored Orphan Asylum in Riverdale to build themselves a swimming pool . We have an ideal spot for it . The older boys have volunteered to do all the digging and hauling of stone , making the labor cost virtually nothing . With their enthusiasm aroused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and even the smaller children are pitching in to help . By the end of this week all the digging will have been done for a twenty by forty foot pool two to four feet deep . To complete the job , however , we need about $250 for sand , gravel and cement ? for which , unfortunately , no funds are available . We therefore appeal to generous readers to help a group of enterprising children , without homes of their own , and whom we are not able to send to camp this Summer , to build their own place to swim in . LILLIE SKIDDY PARKER . Riverdale , N. Y. , July 29 , 1940 . Comment on Judge Proskauer To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : In THE TIMES of July 28 appeared a news item to the effect that Joseph M. Proskauer , " former associate and adviser of President Roosevelt , " came out for Mr. Willkie . Please be advised that Mr. Proskauer was never an associate and far less an adviser to President Roosevelt . Mr. Proskauer is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , like Mr. Smith , " took a walk " not in 1936 but way back in 1932 . Louis KARAsiK . New York , July 29 , 1940.
