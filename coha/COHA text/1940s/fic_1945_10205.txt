" Hank , Hank , " she laughed , " you have n't any more modesty than a horse ! " " Nary a bit more'n one a ' them waltzin ' circus horses , " he laughed . He rose to his feet , held his nightshirt high in hands that pawed awkwardly in the air ; then went into a stiff-kneed dance , crossing his feet back and forth as he sang : " Oh , my gal 's table 's got a checkered cloth An ' her stove is greased free of rust ; Yes , my gal 's cookin ' is fitten for a king , An ' I 'm fixin ' for to eat it till I bust . " At the close of the verse he stopped , feet crossed , and with hands still pawing the air he bowed his back and neck stiffly and whinnied- plaintively . A feel , as of an enlarging of her capacities for gaiety and loving , spread through her . She felt like a queen  --  oh , a very young queen , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why , yesterday every woman who sewed and scrubbed and cooked took on color when Hank approached . And it was she whom he loved ! Lucky  --  lucky  --  her arms raised themselves and , feeling like beauty and rhythm , she whirled . From the deep wells of her being bubbles rose and foamed out on the air as laughter . The green floor of this room was dry . Not the least sticky as was the bedroom floor . Her laugh grew deeper , fuller , as she remembered the reason . The bedroom floor had not been painted until they were ready for bed . Hank , with his nightshirt safety-pinned around his loins , had painted the floor , beginning at the living-room door and crawling back and back until they were imprisoned in bed by the wet green paint . This floor was clean and dry against her feet and she danced round the room admiring it . " Oh , I like my walls and my lovely drapes and my green , green floors ! " she repeated over and over happily. 40Hank gave his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ' N I like that filly with th ' yaller mane Her ' n me could prance down any lane , If I ca n't ketch her I 'll be dyin ' of pain , Oh , I like that filly with the yaller mane . " She ran to him and paddled him almost sharply . " Is that one of those funny folk songs ? Or did you make that up ? " " I made it up . Like that . " He snapped his fingers . " I like words . Allus did . Someday I 'm gon na learn every word there is . " He pulled her to him . " Now I got me a horse ' n cart I c'n be a-settin ' up there with one a ' them dict'naries a-learnin ' words by heart . Or mebbe a-learnin ' them school books we 're a-gettin ' me . " The intent of approach crept into his eyes . " Lord save us , " he murmured softly . He sniffled , looked toward the stove . " My pone 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was red-hot . Smoke crept out through the oven cracks and a grease smoke puffed from the skillet . Verity rose and minced elegantly to the table . " I can see I 'm going to be a lady of leisure . My house is painted , my meals are cooked for me . You 're spoiling me , Hank . " " Wisht you did n't never have to do nothin " cept think of me . " He lifted the blackened pone from the pan and held it for her to see . " Reckon we 'll have to whittle it some . It purely hurts to see food a-wastin ' . Been hungry lotsa times . Lotsa people half-hungry all their lives , I reckon . Take m ' maw . She was plumb gaunted . Had that there look on her t ' make you remember the bones to a body . " " Your mother , " she said wonderingly . She 'd never thought of Hank as being a member of a family . Her whole thought had been on Hank himself . He had seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explanation of growth and parenthood. 41IIe put the pone and sowbelly and coffee on the table and sat down . " I hadda feelin ' for Maw . Maw 's eyes was big ' n askin ' . It was right seldom she seemed to get a answer . When she did , then her eyes was big ' n seem ' . A-seem ' of things not there . " He held a steaming piece of pone , not noticing its heat . Then there was Maw 's maw . Grammaw Kelts . She was.allus a-settin ' by the fireplace ' r the window a-readin ' her Bible ' n a-sneezin ' on her snuff . Y ' know , Verity , when I was a little feller I allus thought of Maw ' n Grammaw as captives . It puzzledme powerful . When Maw was despairin ' she 'd go to the door ' n look out , ' n right pitiful she 'd say , How shall we sing the Lord 's song in a strange land ? " N then Grammaw 'd say it over faint , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out strong with We want t ' go back to Zion , Lord . ' Why , Verity , when I was scarce past my didy years I use t ' wake up ' n sneak outta the house so 's I could think on it . " Sometimes in the fall I 'd be out so early the rime was still a-shinin ' on the grass . Did n't have no proper clothes so I 'd go a-runnin ' to get some blood warmth . The little things of the earth all scurried ' n it pleasured me . ' N all the time I was a-thinkin ' it was a right nice country ' n why want for a place called Zion ? But by the time I was eight ' r nine  --  God'lmighty ! I was a-wantin ' a Zion , too . " For Verity it had the proportions of a revelation . A revelation she wanted to understand . " But being captives  --  what did they mean ? " she urged . " Oh , it all come of Grammaw 's readin " n @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Babylon , there we sat down , yea , we wept , when we remembered Zion . We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof . For there they that carried us away captive required of us a song ; ' n they that wasted us required of us mirth , saying , Sing us one a ' the songs of Zion . ' Then comes Maw 's question  --  ' How shall we sing the Lord 's song in a strange land ? ' " His voice had a rich solemnity to match the majestic corn-42plaint , giving it the emphasis of quotation ; and yet it sounded just like Hank . It seemed to have his rhythm . " You know the Bible pretty well , " she said . " Hell , I was suckled on it , Sweetface . Thing ' at got my mind set on bein ' a talkin ' whiz-bang was them camp meetin 's . First off , I was set on bein ' a preacher . But time I got twelve years on me I knowed I was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coppers . A man that 's purely in a lather from movin ' folks to go thou ' n sin no more is worth more'n a picayune . " " What about your father , darling ? " she asked . Contempt curled his lips . " Paw was a pulin ' man , " he said simply . " Allus a-cryin ' the mouths he hadda feed kep ' him pore . Maw done more work in the fields than ever he done . Borned him seven young'uns , too . Just three of us was a-livin ' . Y ' see , Verity , we was in the pine hill country where the earth ai n't a-yieldin ' up like here . Still , there 's a-plenty to eat iffen y ' jus ' happen to be the sort as can get it . " He stared out the window . " Twelve years I was when he bound me out to Farmer Plinkham . He was n't the starvin ' kind . God'lmighty ! I was out aworkin ' afore the stars left the sky , ' n @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night . God'lmighty ! " Twelve years old , just a baby ! Tears burned her eyes . And people were sorry for orphanage children ! Hank grinned at her . " Do n't be a-lettin ' it salten yore eyes , Sweetface . It done a-somethin ' for me . A whole year I was with Plinkham a-workin ' f ' my grits ' n pone ' n for my pallet in a outshed , ' n for a dollar cash a month to be give me the followin ' harvest . " His voice hardened . " Th ' somethin ' it done for me was to make me know no matter what I hadda do , I was gon na go up ! At camp meetin 's I watched the preacher ' n what he done to folks . It was then I knowed I was gon na move folks too  --  but not preachin ' for no picayune ! " Her eyes saltened in spite of her best efforts , pity for a young Hank spread her chest and throat to hurting. 43 " Damn if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Helluva note . Bridegroom a-cookin ' his bride her breakfast ' n a-lettin ' it burn whilst they play 's one thing but a-lettin ' it go grease soggy whilst he drools on what 's done ' n over is another . " " I 'm glad you did , Hank , " she said softly . " Please tell me more about . . . " " Lissen ! " He tilted his chair to look out the window . " There 's a starched nigger a-comin ' . Looks to be Jules Bolduc 's nigger . " Resenting this interruption she rose from the table to don her kimono . She mast know more of 1lank 's childhood . Must know why he had never mentioned it before , why she had never thought of him as one of a brood . Seeing Hank about to open the door , she exclaimed in an urgent whisper , " IIank , you 're in your nightshirt ! " With a great show of quiet and stealth he tiptoed back to her , put his lips against her ear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whispered , " iffen he 's seen a nightshirt afore . Would n't s'prise me none iffen I went up in his eyes , seein ' I do n't sleep in m ' underpants . " The well-bred , short little knock sounded on the door again . Grinning back at her , Hank went to the door and flung it wide . " Mornin ' ! " he said heartily . " I'se Moses , suh . " The stiffness of his white coat and trousers made little crackles as lie bowed . His close-cropped white hair seemed as starched as his suit . Ile looked past IIank at Verity and bowed again . His fine long black hands with fingers interlacedwere held in front of him away from his body , giving the effect of offering something when he bowed . " Moses , huh ? " There was a slight query in Hank 's voice . . " Yassuh . Is you Mistuh Hank Martin , suh ? " " That 's me . " " Mistuh Jules Bolduc 's compliments to you , sub . He wantses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by comin ' to dinn a tonight ? Seb'n o'clock ? " " T ' dinner ? " Plainly Hank could hardly believe his ears . " Yassuh . Seb'n o'clock . " Moses half turned to leave . 44 " Moses , " said Hank as if speaking to an old friend , " I 'm plumb fulla puzzlement . " Moses turned . His eyes on Verity were gentle and knowing . He bowed again and his hands seemed to make a physical offering of his courtesy . Then turning to IIank he grinned . " Mistuh Jules say he liken ter fall off his hawse dis mawnin ' wen he see dis painted house . " He bowed again . " Seb'n o'clock , Mistuh Hank , suh . " Hank stood quietly watching Moses . The fine long hands swung at his sides now as he strode under the live-oak tree and on over a little rolling swell in the earth toward the manor house.  --  Mistuh Hank , suh , ' " repeated Hank slowly , tasting the words . " Mistuh Hank , suh . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound of that . We 're gon na hafta git us a nigger . " Three flies buzzed and circled over the table . Verity shooed at them ineffectually . " We 'll get some screens , first , " she said absently . " That 's a right likely notion . Would n't ' a dreamed a painted house 'd make a impress on Jules Bolduc . His own house needs a paintin ' iffen he was to ask me . " He grabbed a dish towel , flipped it at the flies . They escaped to the ceiling . With a corner of the towel in each hand he skipped about waving it vigorously , finally maneuvering the flies out the door . " Dinner . At Jules Bolduc 's ! " he gloated . " It makes a real beginnin ' . All ' cause a house gits painted . " He shook his head . " Do n't know oughten I t ' swaller that whole ' r not . " " It 's just a neighborly gesture , " said Verity . " Neighborly , hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they got borned  --  since their grandpappies got horned  --  ' n they ai n't et their dinner there yet . A-course , we 're different . " But her mind was not on Jules Bolduc nor his invitation . She was trying to picture Hank as he might have looked at twelve. 45 " How much money did you have coming to you the follow- ing harvest ? And what did you do with your money ? " " What 'd I do with it ! I went into bizness . That 's what I done . After Maw sent me away  --  well , I was n't gon na do farmin ' . Hell , farmin ' makes a mule outta a man . Were n't nothin ' else I could do ' ceptin ' start a little peddlin ' . ' N I been a-thrivin ' ever since . " There was pride in his voice . " Your mother sent you away ? But , Hank  --  " " It 's this-a-way , Sweetface . " Ile turned from the door and began pacing the floor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . Come harvest , Paw come , too . T ' collect the money I sweated ' n slaved for . Fourteen dollars . Looked t ' be a sizable fortune t ' me , Verity . I watched him pocket m ' money ' n I follered him out t ' th ' gate . " Gim me m ' dollars , ' I says . ' N he tells me that all I earn till I 'm a man growed b'longs t ' him . I screamed ' at it do n't neither . But he turns , ' n I watched him a-walkin ' the road t ' home . I set on the rail fence a-feelin ' doomed . Till I was a man growed looked t ' be a long stretch , Verity . ' N then a rebellion hottened in me ' n pushed my throat ' n ribs most to bustin ' . I run cross country to home . Spite a ' it bein ' a coolish day the sweat was a-runnin ' down m ' britches . " I caught up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gim me m ' dollars , ' I says agin stubborn ' n fixed . ' N he picks up a old ax handle ' n starts t ' lay it on me . " He whirled to Verity . The fierceness of old hurts flared across his face . " But the fields gim me strength in them fourteen months ' n I jumped in ' n bust him in the belly ' n the chin . Paw went prone agin the choppin ' block ' n laid there . Maw ' n Grammaw Kelts come a-runnin ' out . I leant over Paw ' n took m ' dollars outen his pocket . You 're a-takin ' yore earnin 's back t ' yoreself , ' Maw says , just that calm . Yore brothers ai n't a-comin ' till sundown , ' she says . Then Maw ' n me lugs Paw in to his bed . Grammaw Kelts looked him over close . He 's gon na live , ' she says like as iffen it 's a great pity . " He sat at the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'll never forgit Grammaw Kelts then . Account she 's got no teeth she gums her words as well ' s her vittles . ' N d' you know what she says , Verity ? " He pounded the table . " B'God , I put a store in them words a ' hern . " Verity sat spellbound , not daring to risk a question . " Grammaw Kelts says , " he drew his lips inward , his voice quavered in imitation , " You 're liken to m ' maw 's paw . Him as had the name a ' Breckinridge . Him as built a town in Virginny . M ' maw use'n to be allus a-tellin ' of him when I was a tyke . Reckon m ' maw was the first a ' our tribe t ' git took to a strange land . ' " His voice took on its natural fullness again . " All the time Grammaw 's a-talkin ' , Maw 's a-fixin ' a poke a ' hoecake ' n such , ' n she brought the poke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're the child of my heart . Them others is purely the childern of m ' loins . ' Ceptin ' for you I birthed a pulin ' litter : " Hank shook his head as though trying to come out of some unhappy hypnosis . " I can see her plain , " he went on softly , " like as if she was here a-standin ' afore me now in a wore-out black calico liken all the pine-hill women . But that was oncet she stood straight ' n sorta uplifted . That was oncet she got a answer ' n was aseein ' of things not there , ' cause she says , I want y ' should go away . Fur away . I want y ' should fergit us . Stand up , son , ' she says , you got t ' git a-goin ' . I 'm a-thinkin ' I birthed one as c'n mebbe git back t ' Zion . ' So I got a-goin ' . " He ended simply . His hand on the table clenched and opened and clenched . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maw should ought a had somethin ' . Leastways a purple dress . " Verity leaned over the table and kissed his warm hand , but his hand , feeling the still warmer tears , lifted her face . " Lord save us , Sweetface , " he admonished softly , " you looky here  --  do n't never salten yore eyes for what 's done ' n over . Yore bridegroom likes ' em best with storm riffles . " Shoving the crocks and dishes aside , he leaned far over the47 table , then belly-bustered slowly across it to her . His lips touched each eyelid gently , then whispered , " D' you know what kind a ' kissin ' that is ? " She shook her head . " It 's kissin ' afore lovin ' , " he said low and soft . A nervous uncertainty about going to dinner edged her mind all the while she was dressing . After much hesitation , she had decided her wedding dress was the most appropriate thing she owned . She knew its full skirt and trim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give the confidence she had hoped it would . She had done her hair three times and knew it lay in smooth waves and coils , and yet she half dreaded to meet Jules Bolduc . Now as she walked with Hank under the live-oak tree she felt lacking in dignity . " Too much love , " the imp in her mind warned , " too much , too much . " As the thought came to her she touched her cheeks and wondered confusedly whether it had left its mark on her . She was glad to be out of the little house . Flank put his hand on her back between her shoulder blades , and even in the midst of such thoughts , all her being seemed to rush to that one spot to meet his touch . " Ai n't it beautiful ! " he exclaimed , drawing a deep breath and swatting a mosquito at the same time . " ' Ceptin ' for skeeters ' n moccasins ' n such , God 'd live in this here country Hisself ' n call it heaven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't look different . Why then should she ? He looked just as he had yesterday when he called " Howdy , Jules . " The little house had not marked him . Walking with him made her feel better . They were going someplace together . She was not just a woman to be kept in a house and loved . She was his partner . From the top of the knoll the manor house glowed with win- dows of flame reflecting the reds which still warmed the sky . The dark slick leaves of the magnolias in the manor lawn glis- tened , almost shaming their big white blooms . On the gallery 48 in a green slat chair sat Jules Bolduc , his white suit faintly pink with sky color . He rose and came down the walk to greet them , " Evenin ' , Jules , " Hank called . " Good evening , Hank . " He did not call . to Verity , but came on down the walk to her , held out his hand to receive hers , then touched it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mrs. Martin . " The nerves in her stomach unlaced themselves and she was comfortable . Somewhere the evening damp was pulling perfumefrom out the jasmine and spreading it like a tangible thing . " I do n't see the jasmine , " she commented . " There is a hedge out back , " Bolduc said . " Sometimes one can smell them a mile away . Rather wonderful , is n't it ? " She laughed . " I never really liked jasmine until tonight . " " I prefer to take that as a personal compliment , " said Jules . " B ' God'lmighty , lookit there ! " Hank pointed at the house . " Them two dispairful shutters is nailed up straight ' n perk ! " " It is completely due to you , Hank . You stirred me out of a five-year lethargy . When I saw a snug white house where only the day before had been a gray , run-down . . . " He shrugged and smiled . " By the way , " he continued , " it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City may be here this evening . I had a note this afternoon saying I could expect them tonight or tomorrow . " " Robert J. Castleberry the fourth ? " asked Hank with heavy sarcasm . " Yes . Do you know him ? " " Naw . I been plumb pertected . Up t ' now , leastways . I reckon he 's a-drivin ' through the country now a-lettin ' his eye rove over the cotton fields , a-judgin ' how much kin he be ( ' xpectin ' at all the gins he owns , come pickin ' . " Hank 's voice was broadly casual . " ' Spect he 's a-makin ' loans for his bank , too . ' Spect ninety per cent a ' the ownin ' planters has got ta borry off him to see ' em through to fall " 49 " Hm-mm . " Jules made a noncommittal sound . " You 're from the North , are n't you , Mrs. Martin ? " " Yes , Pennsylvania . " " Mrs. Castleberry is also from the North . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two before she married Robert . She was Mavis Easton . Did you ever happen to see her ? " " No , I was never in New York , Mr. 13olduc . I never went anywhere until I came down here , " she said simply . " I hear tell , " said Hank , " that this here Miz Castleberry 's right well worth lookin ' at . There 's folks in Loder City as says he just natcherly hadda add her t ' his collection . Did n't make no sense stein ' as how lie 's always been plumb skittish ' round th ' womenfolks . " " All , well , I suppose people did a lot of talking . " Jules laughed . " I can see what they meant , though . Mr. Castleberry collects rare old jades . " " Old jades ! " exclaimed Hank . " Sounds plumb floozy . " They were on the gallery now and Jules opened his wide front door . The gracious hall welcomed Verity with the dulcet tones and gleamings of old mahogany . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an impulse to return the bow , she stood still , curious and enchanted . Never had she dreamed a big house could feel like this . It was bigger than the orphanage , yet it had no feeling of emptiness , though it housed only one man and his servants . The huge living-room rug was a thing of many colors , and two splendid candelabra on the marble mantelpiece made a shrine to a dark-eyed , lovely lady who sat pensive , and at peace , in a wide gold frame . Everything here had a fine old pride . This place stands for something , she thought , like a big silk flag that 's been through battle and comes out waving and a little frayed . Hank walked through the house quite at ease . He did n't even look out of place here . His purple striped suit , his pink shirt were in themselves a rude insult to the rooms , but Hank was50as completely himself here as in his own house , or on his own cart . He had none of the chameleon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be impressed . " Let 's go into the library , " suggested Jules . Hank stood in the doorway and glared at the long high walls lined from ceiling to floor with books . " Christ ! " he exploded . He strode across the room to the little mahogany stepladder , looked up at the rail on which its wheels ran . His fist gave it a vicious whack on its siding and the little ladder went skittering the length of the room . Verity 's knees felt weak . " Hank ! " she protested . But he did n't hear her . " Wo n't you sit down , Mrs. Martin ? " Jules Bolduc was undisturbed by Hank 's outburst . " There , please , by the window . The flowers will furnish just the right background . " His smile reassured her and she sank into a chair of leather , old and pliable as chamois . Hank strode around the room glaring . " God'lmighty , what the hell right you got to all these here books whilst kids ca n't get ary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state for books ! " he stormed . " Roarin ' thunderbolts ! Why the hell did n't they take some a ' these ! " " But , Hank  --  " Jules interrupted her . " Do you think I have n't the right to these books , Hank ? " " You read all these here books ? " Hank demanded . " Well , no , I have n't . " " It ai n't right ! God'lmighty , here you 're a-settin ' hoggin ' books y ' ai n't read ' n thousands a ' kids withouten learnin ' , withouten ary book . " " I see , " said Jules , his one-sided smile spreading . " Are you a disciple of Saint-Simon ? " He gave the name its French pronunciation . " San Seemawn , " Hank mimicked bitterly . " What 's that ? " " Perhaps I should give it the English pronunciation  --  SaintSimon ! " Jules picked up a book from his desk . " Odd you should51have this attitude toward my books , Hank . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " His lips curled downward . " It has seemed to me that all the so-called poor and downtroddenare bitter and wishful . Short on working and long on wishing . Not wishing to acquire through their own efforts , but wishing to see someone else divide his riches with them . " He sighed heavily with mock despair . " I had thought you different , and here you are thinking I should divide my books . " " You thought I was different , ' r- I am . I think books is different , ' n they are , " I lank declared loudly . " Ai n't no man got a right t ' be a-hoardknowledge jus ' ' cause he 's got the money to pay for the paper ' n the leather it 's a-hidin ' in . " He leaned over Jules 's desk and jounced up and down on his heels with the air of a preacher ir1 the throes of a conviction . " Not no man ! ' N I 'm a-tellin ' y ' when I 'm governor a ' this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' git free books ! " " Governor , Hank ? " Jules tilted back in his chair looking into Hank 's eyes earnestly . " I would not set my heart on that , Hank . " " Why the hell not ? " " I 'm sure you would be as good a governor as most , " replied Jules placatingly . " But you could not possibly get elected in this state . The voters here have a passion for paying complimentsonly to members of the old families when they go to the polls . " " That 's purely a habit I 'm a-goin ' t ' break ' em of someday . " IIe laughed . " Hell , Hank Martin do n't never talk through his hat . Ai n't that right , Sweetface ? I 'm gon na make lotsa folks voters as ai n't never voted afore . Hell , as ai n't voted in gen-erations ! " She sat entranced as by a show . " Ai n't that right , Sweetface ? " he repeated . She could not bring herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had been trained to heel ; but she smiled in his direction . Jules was studying Hank . " But , " their host pointed out , " we have a literacy and prop-52erty law in this state , I believe . I have never looked up that law , but I have always understood from those in politics and government that voters must be able to read and write , or they must own property worth at least three hundred dollars . " " Yeah , " said Hank . " Allus I 'm stuck on that . But , " he grew very intense , " I 'm gon na change that , too . I purely am . How is pore folks a-goin ' to learn iffen the rich as can vote do n't never vote money for schools ? ' N whilst a book costs ' em two , three whole dollars ! " His voice was a moving blend of pleading and outrage . " How the hell are sharecroppers gon na get three hundreddollars ' worth a ' property ! " He shook a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a-findin ' a way . You 'll be a-seem ' someday . I 'll be a-findin ' a way iffen I got ta test a white man 's right to vote in every goddam court in this here whole country  --  come time I 'm a lawyer . " The thought disturbed him and he paced agitatedly up and clown the room while Jules watched him with interest and Verity watched him with some apprehension . " The worst a ' the whole thing is a feller has got ta stir folks as ai n't mebbe had enough vittles ' n hope for to grow some gumption . Got ta stir ' em into holdin ' together for a aim . Yeah , that 's mebbe the sticker . Aw , hell ! " he exclaimed , frustrated and angry . Verity leaned forward . " Mr. Bolduc , " she needed a change of subject , " the satire you said you were writing  --  I did n't quite understand . " " Yeah , " said Hank , " what was you a-talkin ' of anyhow ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Jules picked up a sheaf of typewritten papers and turned on his desk lamp . Hank snorted . " Lookit that , Verity . Even his own power plant a-buzzin ' somewheres to save Mr. Bolduc 's eyes . ' N the rest a ' us still a-pourin ' coal oil . ' Lectricity 's like books . It had ought a be everybody 's . " Jules smiled ruefully . " Dear me , I had hoped you would enjoy yourself tonight . " " I 'm a-enjoyin ' myself right smart . I 'm a-gettin ' m ' mind 53made up to lotsa things . " He slapped Jules on the shoulder and grinned . " Go ahead , Jules , read them bright thoughts a ' yoren . Expand yoreself . I 'm a-goin ' to be p'lite the rest a ' the evenin ' iffen it busts me . " " Please do read it , Mr. Bolduc . Do n't mind Hank , " Verity urged as Hank perched on the arm of her chair . " Well , it is amusing to realize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is wrong with it . Saint-Simon , for instance . Although he was a French count , he lived for a time in America . At sixteen lie came to this country to fight with Washington 's army against the mighty Cornwallis . " He stopped for a second while his eyes looked bitterly back on a dream . " Yes , it was to Saint-Simon I spoke , not to Lafayette , when our transport nosed into Calais . I lifted my bayoneted gun . Saint-Simon , we are here ! ' " He sighed . " Were you in the World War , Ilank ? " " Nope . They did n't draft fellers under twenty-one years tillst 1918 . But that there armistice come along the follerin ' November'n they did n't never get ' t me . " He fell silent a second , seeming to study on the matter . " Did n't never enlist . I 've ofttimes wondered iffen ' t was ' cause I hadda do so clang much fightin ' just t ' keep alive right here . " Jules nodded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'd be twenty-four this fall ? In some ways you seem much older . " " Why would n't I ! " IIank jumped up and flailed his arms . " Been a-fightin ' in ' way through ' gator swamps for to sell a packet a ' pins since m ' thirteenth year . God'lmighty ! " He whirled on Jules . " You tryin ' to bust me with being p'lite ? God-'lmighty , we come to eat ' n y ' stuff us with this here SaintSimon . Is there a point t ' this Frenchie , ' r ai n't there ? " To Verity 's amazement Jules laughed heartily . He rose , and going to Hank he took his hand and clasped it . Still laughing , he said , " Against my better judgment , I like you , IIan . " ' N agin mine I 'm a-likin ' you , too . " Hank grinned . " Do n't reckon you to be a bit better'n Picayune Potter . Mebbe not so54good . Leastways he 's helped to clutter the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulder genially . " Dang if it do n't beat me how many fools I got ta plumb likin ' for . " Jules laughed and Verity told herself she would have to get used to this sort of thing . It was Hank 's way . And it seemed to be a good way . Never would she have guessed when ules stood beside their cart that these two men would like each other . Her own laughter ran out to join theirs and she settled deeper in her chair telling herself seriously that she would learn to enjoy Hank 's ways . " Evenin ' , Miz Martin . " Moses ' rich voice blended in the laughter like a bass-fiddle note . " Evenin ' , Mistuh Hank , suh . Dinna 's served , Mistuh Jules . " " Nov , lissen , Moses , " said Hank , " you keep that there dinnerhot for a spell . I 'm gon na swaller Saint-Simon first . Hours on end , seems ' s though , I been a-tryin ' to make the master a ' this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sidetrackin'est man ever I knowed . What y ' got fer dinner , Moses ? " Moses rolled his eyes and made a great mound with his hands . " Ham , Mistuh Hank . Stuff ham . I done make hunderds pockets in dat ham . I done tamp in spice , den mo ' spice , an ' Aunabell keep sayin ' ai n't ' null . Dat ham done swole to twice its size . " " Well ! " Hank glowed . " Y ' reckon , Jules , I c'n swaller ham ' n Saint-Simon at one ' n the same time ? " " I think you can , Hank . I 'd like to have had cocktails or a julep . But these prohibition times limit one . I must have faith iii my liquors . Will you take my arm , Mrs. Martin ? " As they reached the hall she hesitated to admire again the lovely stair . " You like my house ? " asked Jules . " Yes . There 's something wonderful about it . " " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sometime  --  perhaps  --  I ' 11 show you the loveliest lady who ever Stepped into it . " " Ai n't none a " em lovelier'n Verity . " 55 " Exactly , " replied Jules , smiling down at her . Hank , following Moses , saw the table first . " Back t ' candlelight . Ai n't there no ' lectricity in this room , Jules ? " " I prefer candles , " said Jules simply . Hank pointed . " Lookit them azaleas , Verity . Reckon I 'll endurethem candles after all , Jules , seeing they 're set like to pickets a-fencin ' them flowers . " He sat in the chair Moses pulled out and watched Jules seat Verity . She thought , He 's rememberingexactly how Mr. Bolduc 's doing this . " I got a plumb admiration for them there flowers , " Hank went on . " Al ind me a ' good women . Yes , sir , I been a-noticin ' as I tromp the woodlands ' at they 're a-flourishin ' best when somethin ' bigger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ai n't a-wastin ' their substance , like some . Ai n't a-givin ' careless . See all them there things fluflin ' liken to lace on a woman 's collar ? " He chuckled . " Them 's really stickers as keeps th ' ants ' n such from depravin ' her honey . Azaleas ai n't a-givin " ceptin ' to bees ' n butterflies , as do right by her pollen . Some a ' them 'd be right fitten in yore hair , Verity . " With the eyes of both men upon her , Verity felt pink as the flowers . The little moment of silence seemed puffed with meaning . Deftly Moses placed before Jules a huge silver platter bearinga mountain of something brownly glazed and steaming . " Mien that 's ham , " said Hank wonderingly , " the hawg as growed that there haunch musta been bigger'n a horse . " " Stuff ham , " said Moses . " Usn proud uv our stuff ham . " Hank sat pulling deeply of the air . " It would shore been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ givin ' us a smeller . Reckon after He stirred us outta dust He felt kinda sorry for such a unflavorsome lot ' n throwed in a smeller . Like addin ' a sprinkle a ' salt . " " The picture you draw of a casually generous Lord ! " said Jules between laughs . " Believe me , Hank , I have always been afraid IIe threw us together just that way . " When Moses put a plate before Hank , he said , " That 's purely56beautiful . I got ta be gettin ' a lesson in the makin ' a ' stuffed ham . " He looked at the forks beside his plate , then grinned impishly . " Eeny , meeny , miney , mo  --  you 're it ! " And he grabbed up one with the quick swooping motion of catching a fly . " I 'm purely a one-fork man , Jules , " he said . Confusion flushed hotly through Verity , but honesty compelledher to remember that there was no reason why Hank should be expected to know about forks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either . His way might be better than sitting uncertain and watchful . Hank took a big mouthful of ham and smacked loudly . " Hum-m-ummm ! Stuffin ' ' r no stuffin ' , no common hawg ever growed hisself a ham liken this , do n't seem 's though . Iffen one did , I 'm a-goin ' to take t ' liftin ' my hat to ' em . " " I think you promised us Saint-Simon with the ham , did n't you , Mr. Bolduc ? " She felt she must say something , take some part . " That 's right , " said Hank . " Iffen you c'n keep yore mind on a Frenchie , go right ahead . With the likes a ' this afore me I ai n't got ta pay you no mind . " " Saint-Simon believed riches should be better divided through the reorganization of society , taking labor for the basis of the new hierarchy . He declared , No man has a right to free himself from the law of labor , " ' Jules 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little satire which I was writing for my own amusement , I point out that Saint-Simon nay have known what was wrong with the world , but failed because he did not know what was wrong with people . " IIe paused , almost expectantly . " And do you know ? " asked Verity politely . " Why , yes , they are all like Hank . " Jules 's voice was smooth vet brightly baiting . " They want the successful to divide their riches with them . " Slowly Hank lowered a filled fork to his plate . His nostrils widened , whitening with reined-in anger , his lids dropped and lifted jerkily. 57 " You 're unfair , Mr. Bolduc , " said Verity stiffly . " Hank thinks knowledge should be free to all . I think so , too . " The tenseness left Hank 's face ; it became again laughing and genial . Verity felt his eyelids had swept the anger from his eyes only to store it in his brain . " All I got ta say , is , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , this here world 'd be purely Heaven . " IIe held out his plate . " Iffen you 're a-wantiu ' to hit me on the button thata-way , Jules , you ought a leastways lemme bulge it out withen another hunk a ' ham . I Lake it easier for y ' to land one . " As Jules filled the plate he said slowly , " I think I 'll take it hack , Ilauk . It is the average person who wants the capable and fortunate to divide with them . " " Still ' n all , the average man , ' s you 're a-callin " em , ai n't so bad . ' I'lie average man 's bound to be the pore man ' cause there 's so clang many more of ' em . ' N mostly , they ai n't worth a Bang , mebbe . Not a clang . " IIe leaned toward Jules . " Now it 's my turn to see can I land one on yore button , so I 'm askin ' you straight  --  would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cushionedwith yore grampaw 's money ? " He paused , enjoying the situation . " Now you answer this honest , Jules . You think it 's any more right you should stay rich ' cause yore grampaw was than it is for me t ' stay pore cause m ' grampaw was ? " " You 're going to extremes , Hank , " Jules laughed . " Extremes , hell ! " exclaimed Hank . Moses entered . " Mistuh an ' Miz Castleberry done come , Mistuh Jules . " " Well , " said Jules and smiled at Hank . " You must have had me spellbound . I usually hear the knocker . Excuse me a moment , please . " He rose to leave , but then all three of them , seeming to feel a demand for attention , looked toward the doorway . Mrs. Castleberrystood there with both hands extended , waiting for Jules Bolduc to come and take them in his . Behind her was Mr. Castleberry 's tall silhouette . Verity was scarcely aware of him then . The hall light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faced and for a moment Verity could n't see them plainly . Instead , she felt Mrs. Castleberry 's presence . Some quality of her hurt Verity . " Moses failed to say you had guests . " Mavis Castleberry 's voice was clear and carefully pitched like a good bell . " I do hope we are not a nuisance barging in this way . But I could not endure to stand on ceremony with you , Jules . " She stood waiting , poised , sure of tribute . " Foolish indeed , Mavis , " said Jules cordially , and taking both her hands in his he drew her into the room . An awareness of her own beauty held Mrs. Castleberry like a tangible brace . Her gown , an off shade of green , snugged her figure , shadowing and high-lighting delicate curves . A slim white neck lifted her lovely head to a haughty height , so haughty as to give it a slight backward tilt , so that the great dark eyes pulled their lids at quarter drape as they looked down on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had never before seen such people . Long thin bones carried Mr. Castleberrywith arrogant assurance . His teal-blue tie and kerchief , his tropical worsted of black and gray dressed him as naturally and handsomely as feathers dress a bird . His lower lip protrudedin a full wide curve , and in the candlelight it shaded out his flat upper lip and made a beak of his narrow nose . He looked at Hank as he might look at a freak , and such resentmentclutched at Verity 's throat that she could n't speak to acknowledge the introductions and was grateful to Hank for his boisterous , " Howdy , Castleberry . " Mr. Castleberry 's lip jutted , his eyes , round and green like gooseberries floating in cream , studied Hank . " And what is your name again , sir ? " he asked . " Hank Martin 's the name . ' N do n't never forgit it . " Hank grinned . " Someday mebbe you 'll be a-hearin ' a ' me much as I been a-hearin ' a ' you . Robert J. Castleberry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What 's that the fourth ' mean , anyhow ? " 59Mr . Castleberry looked at Jules , but getting no help , he cleared his throat and answered stiffly . . " Er  --  aa  --  fourth in my line , Mr. Martin . " IIe emphasized the " mister . " " Only three forebears afore you , huh ? That comes to me liken a blow , Castleberry , " Hank said mockingly . " Only three forebears ! Well , well , ' n here I was a-thinkiii ' everybody 's forebears went a-stringin ' right back to Adam . I , eastways to Cain ' r Abel . " " Just now , " said Jules , coining at last to his friend 's aid , " the only important one in the line is Robert the fifth . Is n't that right , Mavis ? " ITe tun led to Ntrs . Castleberry . " Of coin-se it is right , Jules . I. ant worried about him right now . Robert says it is silly to worry about Bobby , that old Rosa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She shrugged and looked about appreciatively . " So wonderful to be here again , Jules . " " You 'll have dinner , of course . Moses will fix you up at once . " " Well , the fact is , we have had  --  " " We have had a longing for a dinner here . " Mrs. Castleberry finished the sentence , committing her husband . Hank pulled out a chair for her . " Lemme help y ' t ' set , " he said , and put a fine flourish in his bow . She looked a little startled , then ter clear laugh ran the scale with trills . " Tlhe South is wonderful . Simply too wonderful ! I am always being surprised . " " I 'm allus a-bein ' surprised , " said Hank , " but I ought a be plumb ust to it . " " Really ? Are you a Southerner , Mr. Martin ? " He grinned at her . " I 'm a Southerner , awright , awright . Got birthed in the pine hills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm a part this state like as iffen I was made a ' the pine-hill clay ' n the bottom-lands mud . " " Oo-oo . " IIcr nose wrinkled daintily with distaste . " So nasty-sticky when wet , so wretchedly rough when dry . " Her eyes twinkled into her husband 's curdled stare. 60 " Now you 're a-speakin ' the truth plain ' n fine , Miz Castleberry . We got roads in this here state should n't ought a be trod by nothin ' but the feet a ' mules . You come out here from Loder City in a autymobile ? " She half nodded and seemed to fold in the waistline , giving a dramatic suggestion of utter collapse . " Feelin ' powerful jounced , ai n't y ' ? " She laughed . " Yore husband should ought a be shamed to jounce the insidest ' such beautiful outsides as you got . " Mr. Castleberry choked . " Do you hear that , Robert dear ? " Mavis Castleberry teased . " You are entirely right , Mr. Martin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I not say , Robert , that they are more than the human frame should be asked to endure ? Positively unciv-ilized . " Both Mr. Castleberry and Jules started to speak , but Hank gave them no chance . He leaned over the table and looked squarely at Castleberry . " Why' n't y ' tell yore beautiful wife why we ai n't got good roads ? " " Why , damit ! " exploded Castleberry , " any fool knows it takes money to build roads . The taxes would be exorbitant . " Hank chuckled . " Why , damit , " he mimicked softly , " any fool is a-knowin ' full well that iffen we had good roads the sharecroppers'n even the owning planters , liken my good friend Jules here , could haul their crops somewheres ' sides local ginsmosta ' which is owned by you ' n yore crowd , ' n the rest is owned by the Newtons . Now them Newtons is a passel a ' snides . " He looked blandly at Mr. Castleberry 's purpling face , at Jules 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit liken you ' n yore crowd , a ' course , Castleberry . Them Newtons ' scales weigh powerful light , come cotton-pickin ' time . " Mr. Castleberry rose with dignity and finality . Turning to Jules he said , " Really , Jules , you must excuse us . Never did I think the day would come when I would sit at the Bolduc table with a clown . " " Iffen I 'm a clown why ai n't you a-laughin ' ? " asked Hank , grinning broadly . " Iffen my words is a-makin ' yore gorge raise , iffen they 're a-gallin ' you , I 'll be a-sayin ' my so-sorry 's t ' you in any way you 're a-choosin ' , Castleberry . I never knowed you was friends with them Newtons . Roarin ' thunderbolts , I allus thought you ' n them Newtons was agin one ' pother ! " " That 's a dreadful thing to say about anyone . " Jules 's voice was reprimanding . " The Newtons are a fine old family . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a-sayin ' , " Hank agreed . " But the most dreadful thing ' bout it is the plumb pure truth a ' it . " " Hank ! " Verity protested . " You 're making everyone unhappy . Why talk about those people ! " " God'lmighty , Verity , " Hank exclaimed innocently . " You ever knowed me t ' wanta make folks unhappy ? I was just a-tellin ' Castleberry somethin ' he should ought a knowed long ago ' bout them tlaievin ' Newtons . Why , Verity , Mr. Castleberry should ought a mebbe own all the gins ' n give the growers a chancet t ' git a honest price . " Mr. Castleberry seemed to be swallowing Hank 's soothing syrup . His long bones relaxed a little . " Although the Newtons are competitors of ours , it seems impossiblethey would cheat in weights . Have you proof of this , sir ? " " No , " Hank pursed his lips judicially , " ' ceptin ' the fellers say they weigh it on little scales a bag to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scales is . A-course it could be their ' rithmetic seem ' as how  --  like I 'm allus a-sayin ' t ' Jules ' n Verity  --  the pore ai n't gittin ' rightful learnin ' in this here state . " " Verity ? " asked Mrs. Castleberry , trying to turn the conversation . " Such an old-fashioned name . " " Yeah , ai n't that a meaningful name , though , " said Hank proudly . " Verity 's paw come a ' Quaker folks , she says , ' n he named her for her grammaw . Cai n't make out just what the Quaker religion can be . Seems t ' be a-plenty of ' em in Pennsyl-62vania . Seems a little like to the Holy Rollers , ' ceptin ' not mebbe so noisy . " Mrs. Castleberry laughed . Obviously she was enjoying Hank Martin . " Mr. Martin , you are delightful ! " A playful note danced through her trained voice . " Quite the best dinner party I have attended in the South , Jules . " Hank beamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soured look of utter distaste . He rose , bowed stiffly and ever so slightly to Verity , turned to Jules and said curtly , " You will excuse me ? And  --  ah  --  is it asking too much of you to put us up ? " " What nonsense , Robert ! " exclaimed Jules . " You have been welcome here since you were born . " Mr. Castleberry fixed his commanding eyes on his wife . " Coming , my dear ? " But it was not a question . It was a command . Into Mavis Castleberry 's eyes came a haunted look and Verity thought , That 's why she gives me that hurt feeling . But the haunted look lasted only a second , then was replaced by the imperious , haughty air . She rose , said a gracious good night and swept from the room followed by her husband . " Excuse me , Mrs. Martin , " said Jules , " I will be right back . " And he followed . Verity sat very quiet until she no longer heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on earth is the matter with you ? " she asked tensely . " It started out to be such a lovely evening . It would have been all right about the books , " she added in justness , but why did you affront Mr. Castleberry ? " " Affront , huh ? That 's a right good word , Verity , but too clang tame for what I wanta be a-doin ' to the likes a ' him ! " He chuckled . " D ' you see the sonuvabitch a-coddlin ' his feelin 's ? A-inakin ' hisself believe I was a-talkin ' only ' bout the Newtons , a-pridin ' hisself ' cause I 'm a-kissin ' his ass , seems ' s though . " he strode back and forth kicking out his right foot viciously , 63 " When I get ' round t ' kickin ' that thin setter a ' hisn , it 's gon na get such a jolt it 'll plumb take off for the moon . " Verity sighed , feeling completely lost . Could she cope with this man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be dishonest ? " Practicing football ? " asked Jules a bit sarcastically from the doorway . " You c'n call it that , " H.nulc grinned . Then suddenly he laughed heartily and loud . Jules closed the door . " Yes since , more I think on it , Jules , the more I incline to that there notion , i yown ' bout dividin ' the riches . " Half dreamilyhe added , " Often I catch iii'self a-thinkin ' the Lord creates the critters a ' the earth ' n sky so 's him that bath ears to hear ' n eyes t ' see can watch ' n learn ' n judge the human critters rightly . " his eyes half closed and glinted with fiery points . " Now , this here Castleberry  --  I shore would like t ' make him do some dividin ' . First time ever I seed a black skimmer I found myself a-wantin ' desperate bad to squeeze him hard so 's he 'd hafta spew back into the water the little things he 'd been a-skimmin ' into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The black skimmer ai n't agin swallerin ' bigger critters as is a-flounderin ' on the surface , either . " Hank stopped and sat watching Jules 's studying , rememberingeyes . Verity did not understand , but wondered why Hank 's words seemed to take on such meaning to Jules . When Jules spoke it was hardly a whisper . " A black skimmer , " he said thoughtfully . " Yeah . " Hank 's voice was low . " Now I been a-noticin ' how some owners , even big owners , is a  --  gettin ' smaller ' n a-flounderin ' more every year . Take last year . This here country was purely blest . Plumb bountiful it was , as it stood in the fields . The cane growed high , ' n a hungry man could keep strength in him just a-gnawin ' on a snibben he could snipe with his pocketknife . " IIe put out a hand in a gesture which brought visions of far fields .

" He walked back and forth kicking out his right foot at some imagined object . " Yeah , Jules , " he said slowly , intently , " yeah , you gim me that there paper you was a-writin ' on dividin ' the riches . It 's like to prove the aim as will give folks gumption . I aim t ' read it careful . You got a plumb sneerin ' way a ' lookin ' at things as is like to be right revealin ' , seen backside to . ' N I got a plumb natural hate for a bird as can fly so low as t ' keep his bottom beak in water ' n force th ' little things down his gullet ' thouten never lessenin ' the swiftness a ' full flight . Yeah , I got a plumb hate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 65/ tWhere Hank got his ideas on Divide the Riches probably no one will ever know . What kind of mind ( lid this amazing man have that he could stir loyal belief in him with his very first speech ? Yes , Hank 's organization began long , long before the world knew there was such a man in it . He loved to tell how his first meetingg was held , not ina stable exactly , but the next thing to it , for it was held in a blacksmith shop . And he loved to point out that he was one prophet who was honored in his own land , for his first disciples were signed when . . . . -u : SECOND night Verity lay in their bed alone she recog-J sized Jules 's satire as a signpost in her life . An unread- able signpost just now , because Hank bad not yet de- tided in which direction he would point the arrow . She lay there listening to the rain and to Hank 's footsteps in the next room , the squeaking of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his voice as he read and reread Jules 's satire . IIe 's starting on the first page again , she thought . She knew it so well she could fill in the phrases she could n't actually hear . " The chief difference between the animals of forests and fields and the human animal is simply this : the animals of for- est and field live upon meat they hunt for themselves , but the 66 human is not content to do this . The human wants to live on meat which is procured for him by the labor of others . " Now , since only the labor of man saves man from nesting in ground holes and tree hollows ; since only the labor of man produces , it is the ambition of men with ability to make a number of men with less ability work for their profit . But it must be admitted that this is more admirable , since it has been proved through the ages that it is more constructive toward the good of all than is the ambition of the man who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worldly goods . For the poor man 's ambition is exactly the same as the rich man 's  --  except that the poor man secretly realizes he is indeed a poor , inadequatething . But his ego , wishing to strut , declares all men are born equal  --  and any fool can see they are not  --  so what does the poor man do ? He covets what the rich man has acquired . He wants to find a way to make the able man divide with him . " Now every great thinker and philosopher who has delved into the laws that go beyond physical life . .. " Verity sat up in bed , tense and nervous . Would Hank do it again when he got to the next sentence ? She listened. " . . . whether he be Chinese or East Indian or whatever , tells us that covetousness will keep us poor . Our own Christian Lord gave us a commandment , Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor 's wife nor his ass , nor .. " Yes , Hank did it . He kicked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiercely , " the sneerin ' sonuvabitch ! IIe should ought a go withouten no vittles for three , four days . God'lmighty ! " She wanted to scream  --  I ca n't stand it ! I ca n't stand it ! But another part of her brain told her harshly to shut up and demanded : What is it you ca n't stand ? Yes , what is it ? She asked herself . She struggled to find the exact balancing spot on her teeter-totter . One minute she was up in the air with love and pride in Hank , and the next she went down with a terrifying jolt from his bitterness , his fierceness , his intensity . Night before last they had walked silently home from Jules 67Bolduc 's . Hank clutched the satire in one hand swatting a mosquitowith it , or butting out at a lightning bug . Clouds to the west and south were heavy and aching to burst , and the air seemed dull and inert . She wondered if she really smelled the bayou or just imagined she did . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better . She had been so glad to get out of it , and now was so glad to return to it . As Hank lit the coal-oil lamp she felt a real pleasure in the room . Handing Verity the sheaf of papers , Hank said , " Read me this here thing . Do n't reckon it says nothin ' worth the hcarin ' , though . " " Is there a real bird called the black skimmer ? " she asked . " There shore is , Verity . There shore is . Right purty in his high flying he is , too . More gray than black he is . Reckon as how it 's his way a ' feedin ' made folks think a ' him as black . " IIe snorted . " Go on , read me that thing whilst I do a few chores . " She began . In a few sentences she caught the feel of Jules 's smooth cynicism . Hank picked up the water bucket and with a motion of his head asked her to follow . Still reading , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she yet could see by the lamp light , raised her voice to speech-making pitch so that he could hear above the squealing of the pump . As he entered with the full bucket she read : " . . . tells us that covetousness keeps us poor . Our own Christian Lord gave us a commandment , Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor 's wife nor his ass ... IIe dropped the bucket . The water in it rose like a geyser , then plopped out on her fresh green floor . " God'Imighty ! So all a ' us pore folks is a-breakin ' a commandment'cause we 're a-wantin ' a-plenty t ' eat ! Why , Jesus Christ hisself figgered a belly should ought a be full . Did n't He do a miracle to feed five thousand not countin ' the women ' n aildent ? Did n't He turn water into wine ? Did n't God send manna in the wilderness ? Did n't God command Moses to be a-leadin ' His people promisin ' a land a ' milk ' n honey ? " 68So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the path her mind should travel . Simultaneously they jumped on her and began their tug of war . One exulted that Hank should champion the unfortunate ; one shrank from the savage bitterness in his voice ; one longed to rock him gently and give him comfort ; one cried the futile wish to be a god for just one omniscient glimpse of truth ; and one resented the entirebusiness of marriage and Hank and Jules and essays , with a dull red madness . But through and over these emotions was the calm knowledge that all she could do was the thing necessaryat this moment ; so she laid the papers on the table back of the stove , took a gray rag from a low nail , and began moppingthe floor to keep the new paint from becoming pocked and leprous . Ineeling there mopping she watched Hank grab up the sheaf and stride to the table . The full light showed her the humiliation , the pain and bewilderment , as well as the fury in his face , and the mother in her softened her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however fleetingly , to abandon this man . " He needs me , " the mother in her said to the rest of her being , " he 's so hurt . He never had a chance , poor darling . He needs me . " And then she had her omniscient glimpse of truth . Not the kind she had wished for . Not the kind to show the rights of all men . But the kind that comes to a woman . She saw that this man would weave the picture that was to be her life and destiny , and she hoped to God she would have the strength and wisdom to help him with his colors and design . His voice read on , turning Jules 's sharp barbs into blunt cruelties . Jules Bolduc , she felt sure , had no hate for poor people , had not meant to say that they were all covetous . Jules Bolduc , she felt , was sitting  --  not on the fence  --  but comfortably , upon a turnstile , laughing slyly at the folk on each side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money systems and rediscounts , and all the meaning it had for her was the knowledge that Hank was mad over what it im-69plied and mad because he could n't understand the systems at which the words poked fun . " It is the nature of the human animal , ' " Hank read haltingly , " to try to get to a high place in life , and when a man gets on a pinnacle , or even a little mound , he schemes to make the less fortunate or unsuccessful work to keep him there . ' " Hank stopped and read that sentence over and over before continuing . " ' Actually , it is simpler and easier to stay on a pinnacle of prominence and power than for the poor man to get just enough to eat ; for all the laws have been made by the men on the pinnacles and the mounds . ' " The floor had long since been mopped dry but she still knelt there with the wet gray rag in her hand . After he had reread that sentence the ninth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm a-goin ' t ' git on that pinnacle iffen it takes every gut in in ' body ! " IIe made the pledge to himself solemnly , tensely . " Oh , Hank , " her voice was only a tired whisper , " Mr. Bolduc meant only to laugh a little at everybody . " He turned toward her blinking like a wakened sleeper . " Sweetface ! What y ' a-doin ' a-squattin ' there like as if you was a Chitmacha squaw ? " " I was mopping the floor , " she said , feeling very foolish . Ile came to her and helped her up . IIer whole tired body seemed to rash appreciatively to greet the touch of his hands , to thank them for their warm pulsing promise of comfort . " You should ought a be abed , Sweetface . " IIe lifted her up , carried her into the bedroom , and put her on the bed . He unlocked her clinging arms . " Now we ai n't got time , " he said softly . Turning abruptly he left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now as she sat in bed waiting for him to read again , and hearing the rain on the roof and walls , she felt an anxious pity for his tiredness . He had not slept these two nights , had eaten only an occasional hoecake or a bit of cold fried salt pork which he picked up automatically from the stacked plates she70left temptingly upon the table . She knew a new admiration for him , felt him struggling to produce in himself a new growth . " God'lmighty ! " His voice was different . What did the exclamationmean this time ? She jumped from bed , ran to the door , and opened it quietly . " God'lmighty ! " he repeated . Jubilance and light were in his face . " A-course ! God'lmighty , ai n't I been dumb ! Why , that 's the greatest campaign stuff ever wrote , I bet ! " She had meant not to intrude herself into his thoughts , but she exclaimed unbelievingly , " Campaign ! " " Yeah , campaign  --  campaign , " he exulted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the weary , whiskery face . " Verity , them there pages is the key t ' m ' future ! Yes , sir , the key t ' m ' future ! When Jules Bolduc said poor folks 'd like to make the rich divide he shore knowed what he was a-talkin ' about . He shore did . But it plumb makes the blood to boil t ' be a-hearin ' it from the likes a ' him . Covetous , he says we are . Well , I 'm plumb gon na take the covetousness outta wantin ' to make the rich divide the riches . I 'm plumb gon na make it a political campaign ! " " But you ca n't campaign for anything ! You wo n't be ready to campaign for years and years . Why , Hank , you need . . . " " You watch , Sweetface ! You watch . Tomorra I start a-earn-1 ) aignin ' . I ai n't mebbe gon na run for nothin ' for years ' n years . No office , I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomorra . " It had no meaning for her . How could he campaign ? " I 'll fix you something hot , " she said , crossing to the stove . " I ai n't a-needin ' nothin ' but a spell a ' hibernatin ' . " Going into the next room he toppled onto the bed without removing his trousers and shirt . Grinning groggily he said , " I ai n't got the words for it tonight , but I got the feel for it clear ' n plain . Tomorra I 'll have th ' words ' n I 'll start a-campaignin ' . 1 ) ' you know who 's gon na be m ' first disciple ? Tim Peck . Yes , sir , Tim Peck . " His last words slowed down with sleep. 71 The next day , as they walked toward the village and Tim Peck 's blacksmith shop , Hank 's lips moved on the words he had to have . The hot sun pulled steam up into the air , big drops of rain the sun had not yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoes as they crossed the fields . The world seemed to have enjoyed the beatings of wind and rain . The grass stood up again and plants bore tiny green buds to make up for broken blooms . The softened earth let new sprouts creep out to the sun . " Tim 'll be a-workin ' clay like this , " Hank remarked . " Wo n't none a ' th ' Wien be a-wantin ' t ' toss horseshoes . Mud 'd be knee- deep out back a ' th ' shop . " how strange it was , she thought , that in any place men could find games to play . But when their women gathered , they sewed or cooked for the church . As they reached the road they must cross to get to Tim 's shop , she stopped . Mules had pulled wagons down this road , and instead of an innocent glazed blackness it had the look of churned and steaming tar . " Helluva note in this day ' n age . Jus ' cause men was a-flyin ' like birds in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ai n't still a-troddin ' the earth . " He grunted disgustedly and stooping , took off his wet shoes and socks and rolled up his pants legs . Verity made no move to follow his example . She could n't imagine herself going into Tim Peck 's shop holding her skirts up from muddied legs . Hank grinned and lifting her up in his arms , looked at her wet brown shoes , her wetly clinging brown stockings . " Ca n't have mud a-oozin ' up them , " he laughed . " I purely worship them golden calves . Here  --  " He handed her his shoes . " Hang onto ' em , now . " She laughed and hoped no one would see them . With one arm around his neck and one hand dangling his wet shoes she felt gay and silly . Hank walked into the road sinking deep in the mud . Look- 72 ing at her feet he chuckled and chanted , " How beautiful are thy feet with shoes , 0 prince 's daughter ! ' N th ' joints a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a round goblet which wants not liquor . . . " She squirmed , but his arms tightened . " Hank ! Flank Martin ! What on earth are you saying ? " " I ai n't a-sayin ' . I 'm a-singin ' . Song a ' Solomon , ' s a matter a ' fact . " He cleared his throat , stopped in the middle of the road and chanted softly , " Thy belly is like a heap a ' wheat set about with lilies . Thy two breasts are like young roes that are twins . Thy neck is . .. " She struck him half earnestly across the shoulders with his shoes . Hank lifted his head to laugh , then called loudly , " Howdy , Tim ! " She turned her head and , seeing Tim Peck and several others in the doorway of the shop , felt a hot red creep over her face . " You fellers seen m ' wife hit me , " Hank called out , shaking with laughter . " I want y ' all to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she should ought a hit y ' with a crowbar , " Picayune Potter wheezed at them shrilly . Struggling to pull a foot up from the black glue , Flank teased softly , " Allus thought Solomon got his five hunderd wives on that there chapter ' n here I ai n't able to woo one t ' a state a ' soft givin ' . " " Do shut up , Hank ! " She hissed it almost fiercely . " Why , a feller dass n't stop whilst his love 's a-spittin ' fire . I 'll give it another try , " he teased , then chanted softly , " Thy stature is like to a palm tree . I said , I 'll go up the palm tree . Come , my love , let 's go forth ' n lodge in the villages  --  " She gave lip the struggle . How strange , she thought . We started out so earnestly . She had been upset at the idea of campaign . Surely lie would n't be capable of saying anything sensible to those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have clear and plain . Thinking then of the long , tiring , tense time while he studied Jules 's sheaf , the thought came to her that she should be grateful that he could concentrate so intensely and come73out of it laughing and playing . She patted his shoulder lightly , feeling strangely shy . " So I 'm finely a-gettin ' some'eres with you , " he laughed , takingthe last steps to the green field but continuing to carry her , chanting softer and softer , " . . . ' n at our gates are all manner a ' pleasant fruits , new and old , which I have laid up for thee , 0 my beloved . " At the narrow plank walk he put her on her feet . She stood uncertainly a moment , feeling a wealth of mixed enjoyments  --  the peculiar sense of life 's fullness which Hank 's nearness always gave her , pride in the pleasure in men 's voices as they greeted him , the inviting smell of fresh green things of the earth blending with the smells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building which gave out from its unpainted porousness the odor of horses which had been shod here for almost a century . " IIowdy , Miz Martin , " Tim Peck greeted her , and the prickly , callous feel of his hand pleased her as it had before . " You 're shore powerful welcome here . Picayune , make yore howdy-do 's quick ' n run t ' the house ' n tell Maw . Tell her m ' fire 's hot ' n to bring her mixin 's . " " Howdy , Miz Martin , " grinned Picayune . " You 're a-lookin ' right peart . " " Good afternoon , Mr. Potter , " Verity said . " Call him Picayune , Sweetface . These here folks is friends ' n neighbors . " Tim called after Picayune , " Ask Maw where is the young-'uns . They should ought a make their kowtows t ' Miz Martin . " " Aw , let the young'uns alone , Tim . That is , iffen they 're a-playin ' . Iffen they 're a-workin ' , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shore wants to be a-seein ' ' em . B'lieve in trainin ' the young t ' think a ' me with pleasure , Tim . " He winked . " They 'll mebbe be a-votin ' time I 'm a-runnin ' . " L eryone laughed . " The rest a ' you fellers has met m ' wife , too . But seein " s how , Sweetface , y ' met so many at our paintin ' party , reckon 74it 'd plumb strain the brain a ' giants t ' be a-'memberin " em all . So I 'll tell you over agin . " Clapping one man after the other on the shoulders he named them . " This here rosy-cheeked bald-headed good-for-nothin 's Harry Disbro . He ai n't never done nothin ' worth a tinker 's damn ' ceptin ' t ' marry Jenny . You shore ' member Jenny , Sweetface . She come t ' our paintin ' party in a pink dress . Hair 's pret ' near the color a ' yores . Little bitty thing she is ' n @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ totin ' a ' them big fat twins . " Harry Disbro glowed with pleasure at Hank 's flattering remarksabout his wife . " I do remember your wife , Mr. Disbro . " Verity smiled . " Reckon it wo n't do no harm t ' go fetch her , " he said almost shyly . " I 'll tote her ' n the twins , too , crost the road . " " That 'll plumb put me t ' shame , " said Hank . " This here little squab with the picked look 's Hannibal Swithers Dupree . Call him Swith , for short . Takes the little fellers t ' grow them long names . But liken all squabs , Sweetface , he 's choice . Yes , sir , Swith , you 're a choice a ' mine . " She liked Hannibal Swithers Dupree . The sparrow-boned little fellow had big , intelligent eyes . Picayune came in puffing . " Sophy 'll be here soon 's she gathers up her mixin 's . " " ' N this here four-by-seven 's Whale Cruze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rightful name , Whale ? Do n't reckon I ever heard it . " Four-by-seven was almost an accurate description of his dimensions , and the big man roared . " Iffen y ' wo n't never tell a soul , I 'll admit m ' maw named me Cuthbert . " Laughter doubled and redoubled in volume . Even Tim , who was doing mysterious things at the forge , stopped his work of fitting a grill-like thing of iron over the fire . Seeing Sophy comingHank hurried to her and took the huge clothesbasket loaded with bowls and boxes and bags. 75 " Sophy , " he said , almost bowing as he took her burden , " ai n't nothin ' like you in the whole state . Ai n't ' nother woman could think up nothin ' half so nice as these here parties in the shop . " " You ' n yore syrup , " Sophy chided . But she beamed on him . Verity held out her hand to Sophy , but Sophy put her arms around her and hugged her tight . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' are . " Sophy 's voice held the warmth of real affection . " It 's right glad we are to be a-seem ' of y ' . " Nodding her head for emphasis she released Verity and bustled across to the forge , seeming to crackle with energy as her dress crackled with starch . Opening the boxes and bags which IIank had put on a bench , she began pouring and mixing while Tim finished adjusting his handmade top oven and grill . " We did n't mean to put you to so much bother , " said Verity . " Pshaw , now , " said Sophy Peck , " ai n't no sich a thing ' s bother when it comes t ' loin ' fer friends . " She smiled . " Well , here comes Harry withen Jenny ' n th ' twins . " Little Mrs. Disbro , in a dress all wilted and soiled with the abuse it had taken from the twins , came in and drooped onto a bench , sticking her muddy feet and legs out straight . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry y ' crost the road . " IIank grinned at her . " I was plumb anxious he should n't be a-doin ' it , too . Planned you ' n me 'd wash our feet in the trough together . Seein ' y ' wore shoes I plan now to carry in ' niud home with me . " Verity sat down beside Jenny and took one of the babies . Sophy poured a creamy corn batter over stewed fruit and stuck the pan in the oven . " My , my , " she said , " this forge saves me a lotta hot hours alone in m ' kitchen ! It purely gives me pleasure , it does . " " Hang onto yore pleasures , Sophy , " advised Hank solemnly , " folks like to us do n't get a heap . " " Why , we-all have right good times , Hank , " said Sophy . " Yeah , " said Hank , " ' n this is shore one such time . You-all 76 know I ai n't one for bellyachin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can . Nobody . I 'm a singin ' fool . But by God'lmighty , that ai n't no sign I don ' want more'n I got , ' n it ai n't no sign I do n't want more for any young'uns I might be a-havin ' than what m ' maw ' n paw was able to give t ' me . " He paused . " You 'd like for yore young'uns to have some learnin ' , would n't y ' , Sophy ? Hell , I ' member when you was a-feelin ' so bad cause y ' could n't find the money for all the schoolbooks . " " That 's right , Hank , " said Tim . " You bet it 's right ! " said Hank fervently . " You fellers seen Robert J. Castleberry the fourth , or has he got his fine self out since the rain ? " " Seen him this mornin ' , " said Swith . " Me too , " said Whale Cruze . " Hell , every pickin ' time I owe him m @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . I ai n't never outta debt t ' the thievin ' bastard . " " You ai n't no diff'rent from the rest a ' us , " wheezed Picayune , " ' ceptin ' fer Tim , here , ' n Squeeze-nickel . Only reason 's ' cause Tim shods , ' n Squeeze-nickel runs the store . " " Yeah , " said Hank , " yeah . Well , friends , t' other night I met Castleberry personal . First time . Sweetface ' n me was a-havin ' dinner withen Jules Bolduc up to Jules 's house . " A touch of pride lifted in his voice . " Right in his own house ? " asked Jenny Disbro . " Right in his own house , " replied Hank . " Right in his own fine dinin ' room . His nigger brung us the invite , ' n his nigger ! ) rung in the food on silver dishes . Had a stuffed ham  --  s ' help nie  --  big as a horse 's haunch . Ai n't that right , Sweetface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest in their faces she thought Hank had to stir them up some way . " But Castleberry ' n that hoity-toity wife a ' hisn hadda come in ' n spoil everything . When I saw that Castleberry a-lookin ' at me like as if I was something t ' swaller . . . . " He stopped , pushed his hair back almost sleekly , jutted out his lower lip , put a bent finger beside his nose suggesting a high-bridged length . The burlesque was excellent and his audience guffawed77 " When I looked at him , d' you know what I saw ? " he paused dramatically . " I saw the black skimmer , friends . The black skimmer in the form a ' man . " There were murmurs and exclamations  --  " The black skimmer ! " " Looks ' xactly like him ! " Verity realized that , strangely enough , Hank had mimicked him perfectly , though it was hard to believe that in his bare muddied feet he could make men 's minds see the smooth and elegant Castleberry . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lifting his voice to a shout , lie demanded , " You know , don'cha , that year by year the Black Skimmer is a-forcin ' you down his gullet for to feed and fatten hisself on ? You know , don'cha , that he 's a-doiu ' it withouten never havin ' t ' slack his speed ? Y ' all seen the bird I named him for . Well , I say birds like to him should ought a be squeezed till he spews back some a ' his takin 's . " Ile walked back and forth , threw out his arms . " Hell , friends , I know I ca n't make him do it today nor tomorra , nor next year , nor mebbe even the year after . Mebbe even not for years . But there 'll come a day ! The sad part a ' it all is that he ai n't the only one a ' his kind . Our state 's full a ' the likes a ' him . Mebbe the whole country is . Mebbe the whole world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his eyes . His arms outstretched toward them in the age-old gesture of the humble and pleading . " I ai n't nobody , " he said . " I ai n't nobody but yore neighbor , Hank Martin , from the pine-hill section . I always heard tell that fellers never see nothin ' great in their neighbors . I ai n't a-goin ' to believe that . Now I ai n't a-claimin ' t ' be great . But I claim I 'm a-goin ' t ' give it a helluva try ! " He sniffed and said to Sophy , " Yore cake 's got just the right smell now , Sophy , minute more ' n it 'll be a-burnin ' . . . " " Go on , Hank , keep a-talkin ' , " said Sophy and scurried over to her oven . " Y ' always said you was gon na run this here state , ' n it 'd pleasure us mightily . " She slowed down in her moving between oven and table and the pump at the water trough , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yeah , I wanta be governor some day . But d' you know why ? " lie pounded one fist into the other . " ' Cause , by God'lmighty , I wanta see folks like to you ' n me get a chancet in this world ! I wanta see the young'uns get free schoolbooks . I wanta see folks able t ' read so 's they can understand good enough t ' fight for what they should ought a have ! " Usn in the South got licked by the Yankees oncet  --  so they claim . Reckon we did , too . But the feller as led them Yankees agin us in the War Between the States was a Southerner . He purely was . Yes , sir , Abraham Lincoln was a Southerner . ' N he was a white-trash Southerner , too , seem 's as though . Borned like you ' n me was , in a log hut as was n't as good as some a ' us got , not by a long shot . Borned in Kentucky , he was . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , seems as though . " Yes , sir , I got some feelin ' for Abraham Lincoln ' n I read ' bout him . His paw was right pulin ' , like I said . He let his familylive one whole year in a three-sided shed , like t ' them we house a mule in , seems as though . One whole side open to the weather winter ' n summer . But he figgered there should n't ought a be slavery . Likely he figgered liken you ' n me would ' n likely young Abe , he figgered that-a-way , too . Yeah , likely he looked on the South ' n saw the rich a-gettin ' richer on slaves , whilst a pore white man ai n't got no chancet t ' get a day 's wage agin the slaves . " ' N then up North , Abe says one day t ' them Yankees , he says , Boys , that should n't ought a be . Iffen one day them slaveownersin the South puts up factories for t ' make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ '  --  where you gon na be ? ' " He pounded his fists on a bench for emphasis , then went suddenly quiet-voiced . " Yeah , that 's likely how it was , seems as though . So them Yankees took up guns agin us , ' n  --  with a feller from the South a-leadin " em  --  they won . But is the niggers free ? Not by a damsite they ai n't free ! " His voice lowered to a whisper . " But lemme tell y ' somethin ' , friends , lemme tell y ' somethin '  --  they'rejust as free as you ' n me ! Yes , by God'lmighty , " lie shouted again . " Yes , just ' s free as you ' n me ! You 're slaves , 79 that 's what y ' are  --  slaves ! Yeah , slaves , ' cause the fellers on the top made all the laws t ' suit theirselves ' n to keep the money ' mongst their own kind . " Thrills ran through Verity , but she took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worshiped Hank , Sophy seemed looking at a great brightness , Swith 's eyes implored , and Tim looked at Hank with awe . Whale seemed ready to do something violent about it while Picayune and Harry Disbro were struggling in deep water . " Friends , Abraham Lincoln took on hisself the burden a ' freein ' the niggers . IIe said all men should ought a be free . But he did n't do iiothin ' about freein ' the likes a ' you ' n me . I do n't say he would n't a ' done it iffen some pip-squeak had n't a-kilt him . But I got doubts  --  yes , sir , I shore got doubts . " He stepped nearer the little group , pounded his chest fiercely . " I 'm a-makin ' you a promise , friends . A promise , solemn ' n true . I 'm gon na take on m'self the burden a ' freein ' the likes a ' you ! I 'm gon na take on m'self the burden a ' seein ' yore young- ' uns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ' this here world ! I 'm gon na take on m'self the burden a ' findin ' a way if divide the riches a ' this earth . Yes , sir , by God'lmighty , a way t ' divide the riches ! Now , friends , I 'm a-askin ' you , straight ' n simple  --  you for me or agin me ? " After a dramatic second , Tim crossed to Hank , put his arms around him , and embraced him as father to son . " We 're for you , boy ! " he declared . " We 're for you ! " Holding him at arm 's length , he looked at him searchingly . " But how y ' gon na do it ? Do n't be a-addin ' to folks ' misery a-tellin " em they 're slaves . Do n't do it , boy , not lessen y ' know what t ' do ' bout it . " Tears glistened on his cinnamon cheeks . " Even the dumbest sorta knows he 's a slave liken y ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ? " Hank 's face fell . Plainly he had n't counted on being asked for a definite plan . " Jus ' let Sophy gim me some a ' that cake whilst it 's still hot . " He stepped back from Tim 's hands , went to the trough , and 80 pumped water over his face and head . The flame of hope in face died down as if Hank had pulled a damper when he broke from his hold . " There is a way , Tim , " said Verity softly , " there has to be . l lank has a plan in mind , I know . " A little lie would n't matter , she thought , as she caught Hank 's startled look . So lovely a clream should at least die slowly , not violently . " Just give IIank a little time , Tim . Time  --  you know  --  to get the words to make it clear and plain . " She wished with all her heart that it could be so . " Sure , clear ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Misinterprctingthe silence for lack of understanding , he said belligerentlybetween mouthfuls of cake and thick black coffee , " What ' cha all s ' still for ? Roarin ' thunderbolts , ai n't y ' got the idea yet that you 're slaves ! Take you , Whale Cruze , who owns y ' year after year ' cause y ' ca n't get a hunderd dollars ? Robert J.

" Hank cried . He whirled about to Verity . " Ai n't that a helluva note ! God'lmighty , m ' friends ca n't vote for me ! " The swell of pity rose in her . " I can teach you all to read81I 'm a schoolteacher , you know . " She hoped it did n't sound braggy . " We could have such lovely times together , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cried Hank jubilantly , " that 's it ! She 's gone ' n told it afore I could get it out . That 's the plan ! Here 's how I figger , folks  --  there ca n't be no votin ' for Hank Martin for mebbe quite a spell . Liken I said , friends , I ai n't nobody yet . But I 'm a-goin ' to be for the sake a ' the likes a ' you-all . I 'm one a ' y ' . Verity 's gon na even pick books for me t ' study . I 'm gon na read books that 'll learn me hist'ry ' n law . ' N whilst I 'm a-doin ' that , you folks can learn t ' read . Can any of you read ? " " I can , " said Jenny Disbro timidly . " That 's shore fine , jenny , " said Hank . " Now here 's what we 're gon na do . Iiere 's the plan you 're wantin ' , Tim . Here it is : you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is gon na help get folks together to hear me tell ' cm jus ' what I been a-tellin ' you . You work on that whilst I 'm off a-peddlin ' to get enough money to keep me ' n Verity ' n some to lay by for the day that 's a-comin ' . ' N , Sophy ' n jenny , you be a-gettin ' folks in a mind t ' learn enough readin ' so 's when their chancet comes to vote for the things that 'll make livin ' better for them ' n their young'uns , they can go t ' the polls like as if they was borned t ' millions , ' n say their say in writin ' ! " Yeah , that 's the right startin ' place . It shore is ! " He glowed . " Swcctface 'll learn y ' t ' write . ' N I 'm a-tellin ' y ' this  --  I peddle up ' n down this here whole state .

" He stopped for breath and beamed . " Just what 'd y ' mean , Hank , " asked Swith , " when y ' said you was gon na find a way t ' divide the riches a ' this earth ? " " Iffen I ever get on the top , iffen I get in a place where I can make laws , I 'll be a-makin ' some laws that 'll change things so 's the bankers ' n the money loaners ca n't be a-keepin ' you down year in ' n year out . Why , I betcha iffen the rich a ' this here state hadda spew into one pot all the money they got , ' n82it was divided even ' mongst everybody , you folks 'd get enough t ' be a-ownin ' yore own land . " " Would n't that be a wonderful thing ! " exclaimed Sophy . " Wisht @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why , you can vote , Mrs. Peck , " said Verity . " Pshaw , hear you tellin ' ! " " Why , women vote , " said Verity with some heat . " My goodness , it almost makes me mad . Why , women voted in Wyoming in 1869 . Since almost the Civil War . And women all over Americawon the right to vote two years ago , in August 1920 . Why  --  " Hank was beaming on her with such elation she was startled . " Ai n't she wonderful ! " he boasted . " Ai n't she wonderful ! I plumb forgot that women was a-votin ' . Roarin ' thunderbolts , ai n't that fine now ! " " Votin ' ai n't women 's business . Polls ai n't no place fer womenfolks , " said Tim . " Tim , I 'm purely dis'pointed in y ' , " said Flank . " Lemme tell y ' somethin ' . I allus figgered Sophy was jus ' ' s smart ' s you .

He jerked his head toward Sophy and Jenny , winking heavily . " Blind man kin see y ' ai n't gon na have no trouble a-fetchin ' the womenfolks . " I Iannibal Swithers Dupree sat through all this with a dreamy , studying air and after the laughter he said , " It 's gon na take Fears mebbe , you say , Hank . I can see that plain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' thouten no hope a ' help ' tillst we git a chancet at the polls . " He looked at everyone timidly . " When the day comes , mebbe you 'll be a-needin ' some extry dollars . " He squared his shoulders and blazed , 83 " ' Twould n't bother me none t ' be a-owin ' th ' Black Skimmer a dollar more ev'ry year . " The steam went out of him again as he added apologetically , " A mite a ' hope 's plumb worth a dollara year , it is . " " A mite a ' hope 's worth a dollar a year , " repeated Hank softly , hunting the meaning . " You aimin ' t ' say you 'd put a dollar a year on me , Swith ? A actual dollar ? " Stunned by the effect of his words , Swith could only look up at Hank with expecting devotion like some noble dog . " D' you mean a actual dollar every year ? " Hank asked again , softly , urgently . " Speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them all in a mesh of stillness , suspended them until sound should come from this human . They stood , like anxious relatives waiting the wail of a new baby . Suddenly Swith gulped air into his lungs . " I mean it , " he cried . " I wanta see them riches divided someday , iffen it ai n't tillst the day I go t ' m ' Maker ! I 'll bank a dollar a year in y ' , Hank . ' N so 'll others . Lotsa others , I betcha ! " Blood pinked his thin , sallow flesh and his eyes praised the new world they visioned . " God'lmighty , " said flank prayerfully , " God'lmighty ! " Hank 's friends looked at him with adoration , their voices blended in agreement like a joyously solemn hosanna and over all was Tim 's fine bass , " We 'll see y ' through , boy , iffen th ' Lord 'll let us . " Verity looked at Hank . Through the prayer in his eyes there crept a canny computing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to life to protest this scene . " But this is homage , " she cried . " This is homage ! " But not loud enough . No one heard her . No one at all. 845Hank Martin , peddler , was welcome everywhere he went . He always came with glad tidings , alwaysoffered a helping hand , always had time to help solve a problem , to listen to troubles . In this state , where there is much religious intolerance , Hank was loved by Protestants and Catholicsalike . Hank Martin is the only man I have ever known who could persuade the bigoted , uneducatedhillbilly or swamplander to put a bright and promising child in a convent . A convent offerededucation and .... " SUALLY Hank helped with getting meals , if indeed he did n't do most of it . But tonight was different . The afternoon 's triumph was wine to the head . He strutted . Ile flailed his arms . " ' N did y ' see the way they was a-lookin ' when I said . . . . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own description of how Swith looked , and what Sophy said . " God'lmighty , Sweetface , it was purely wonderful yore ' mem-I erin " bout women a-votin ' . Where I was a-thinkin " bout one vote , clang if y ' did n't speak right up ' n start me thinkin ' on how I could bg a-gettin ' me two ! " A chuckle grew into a howl of laughter . " Oh , sweet day that 's a-comin ' ! " he cried . " Oh , sweet day that 's a-comin ' ! Iffen ever them uppity swells a ' 85Delamore , ' n Loder City , ' n Sherman , ' n Crescent City  --  them fine fellers that rides t ' the polls in nigger-drove autymobileseversees them sunbonneted women a ' the hills ' n swamps a-stompin ' in t ' mark their ballots !

Y ' go t ' the polls ' n vote when all the other womenfolks goes t ' vote for me ! " She laughed . " All right . I 'll wait and cast my first vote for you , darling . But what about the literacy and property law Mr. Bolduc spoke of ? " Leaning across the table he ran his finger down her arm . " I 'll do something ' bout that  --  somehow , " he said caressingly . " Yeah , I 'll find a way . " He lifted another great forkful to his mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " IIe was eating prodigiously and she was concerned . " Darling , do n't cat so much . After three days of scarcely eatingat all , you 'll be sick . " " Ai n't that silly now ! Animals always does it . Takes ' em days t ' stalk another beast for killin ' , ' n then they gorge . Stummicks is made for shrinkin " n stretchin ' . " " And you 've made your kill ? " Her words startled and hurt her . Why , she did n't think that ! Surely she did n't think that ! With shame she pled , " Oh , Hank , please  --  " She meant to add , " forgive me , " but he interrupted . " That 's right , kinda , " he grinned . " I was shore , days a-stalkin ' the idea that 'd fetch ' em . ' N now I 'm a-gorgin ' , " he said contentedly. 86 " Hank , " she was very earnest , " they worshiped you . Literally worshiped . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Sweetface , y ' got any notion a ' how much is a actual dollar t ' them folks ? Y ' got any notion how much back-breakin ' work , how much doin ' without a dollar means ? Why , a feller like Picayune Potter do n't see more ' n thirty-forty dollars actual cash money in a whole year . Some a " em do n't see that . Some a " em sees mebbe two hun-dred . " " That 's what I mean . Can you live up to what they are expectingof you , Hank ? " " All they 're a-askin ' for right now 's a mite a ' hope , liken Swith said . ' N God'lmighty , iffen I can make them feel that-away , I can make hundreds  --  thousands  --  feel the same way . I can do it , Sweetface , I can do it ! " His voice rose . " But you said today something about making people divide the riches . That 's just silly . You said if all the riches were divided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just are n't done that way . It would n't even be good for people . " She hesitated . " I hate to say it , Hank , but lots of your friends are shiftless . They think they work , and I guess they do . But my goodness ! They do n't mend their porches . Some of them are fine , like Tim . All I 've met are kind-hearted . But , I lank , they are shiftless . " " Hell , Sweetface , I know most a " em ai n't worth a dang . But then agin , they been plumb discouraged for generations . ' N folks like them do n't get no learnin ' . They just kinda foller their instincts ' n does the best they can . Just kinda smellin " n n-fcelin ' their way through the days . " " Yes . " It seemed almost hopeless to her . " Even paint and nails cost something . " " Ai n't it so ! " He grinned and looked appreciatively at the white walls . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know or am like to know ca n't read a letter ! How 'll I ever get ' em learnt enough so 's t ' pick out my name from lotsa other manes ? Even if I lick that law , how 'll they learn my name ? 87Like you said , Sweetface , most a ' ' em is plain shiftless . That there school you think you 're a-goin ' to run  --  there 'll only be a passel comin ' after a time ' r two . ' N then there 's the whole state t ' be a-coverin ' ! " " Too bad , " she said casually , " that they do n't have men 's pictures on the ballots ! " He raised his head in that startled , ready-to-jump , hearing way he had when an idea shot at him from out of her words . " That 's it ! " he exclain ed. " 1 ' 11 have cards made , thousands ' n thousands . Big ones , with m ' pitcher on ' em . ' N under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' N I 'll have m ' pitcher ' n my name on m ' wagon .

" A swell of love pushed at her ribs , love made bigger , sweeter , with something lofty , something proud . Oh , she thought , I wasso silly this afternoon to be afraid for him ! I worship him , too . " That 's wonderful , Hank , it 's so simple . " " Everything 's simple . All the right answers is simple , seems ' s though . " He grinned . " Right now I 'm a-knowin ' I got ta be a-goin ' t ' the city t ' get goods for m ' wagon ' n get on with my peddlin ' . ' N I purely hate t ' leave y ' . But the answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?

" Got ta do somethin " bout learnin ' the ins ' n outs a ' what Jules was a-meanin " bout money systems ' n rediscounts , ' n such . He like ' s not can gim me the name a ' some books I should ought a buy in the city . Let 's go over t ' Jules 's house . " " Oh , no . Not looking like this . Not through the wet fields . " " Aw , he 's seen me barefoot afore ' n muddy . I got things t ' 88say t ' Jules . I 'm a-goin ' . Anyways , you should ought a be a-restin ' for yore ridin ' tomorra . " She followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay home and knowing it would do no good . She wished she had the courage to try to lure him into staying home . He hesitated , looked down at her , and knew her longing . " I jus ' plumb got ta have this somethin " bout money tolt t ' me , Sweetface . " He was almost apologizing . " We should ought a be a-honeymoonin ' . " Bending , he looked into her eyes with a slightly upward , teasing slant . " ' N you was the one , " he taunted , " as was feared you was n't a-goin ' t ' get nothin ' but lovin ' in this here marriage ! " He jumped over the steps and strode into the bluing twilight , singing lustily : " The ' gator slithered t'ward the shore To find a spot t ' sun in , His belly on a tussock scraped . . . " Lightning bugs twinkled like earth-bound stars and tiny mosquitoes , newborn in the day 's damp heat , buzzed their bewilderment . A frog grated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cool stirred in from the west . A feeling of the greatness of life , of the privilege of living , held her in a thrall of content . To live , just to live , was splendor enough . All the little things of the earth were content with themselves and so was she . She was Verity , Hank Martin 's wife . She went inside , I i ghted the coal-oil lamp , picked up the checkered material which was to become curtains for the cupboard , and began sewing . The little house was still and empty without Hank , and Verity had a foretaste of the loneliness of waiting months and months when he would be gone . After a few hours of sewing she busied herself with packing a small bag to take with her on the mortow , prepared herself for bed , and then sat again beside the tuhlc waiting . It was late when Hank came in with his light , lithe step that 89was yet a tread . The little swell of lovely expectancy came in her throat as she heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the yellow lamplight blued his hair and brought out the planes of his dew-damp face . His whole expression was of reverent pleasure as he looked at her . She leaned over the table , both hands stretched toward him in intimate , wordless greeting . " A joy past believin ' it is t ' find you here a-waitin ' . " He tiptoedtoward her as if entering a sacred place . " I 'm so lonely without you , " she said . " How can I stand months of waiting ? 7'lic world is just empty when you 're gone . " it should n't ought a be . ' N I wish you 'd ' a been with me this night . " his voice took on a tone of reflective wonder . " Y ' know what , Verity ? That there Jules , he said some right interestin ' things ' bout me , he did . " " What , darling ? " " IIe 's a strange ' un , but we kinda understand each other , seems as though . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t ' war . He was just a ordinary soldier ' n for the first time in his whole clang life he hadda chancet t ' know common folks , ' n he says he found ' em good in battle  --  even great , he says . It seems Jules was full ' n runnin ' over withen pride in the common Americanfellers when they 're doin ' battle , ' cause they fight like as if they 're inspired  --  like as if they plumb understand the meanie ' a ' democracy ' n sec its greatness , he says . That 's while they 're a-facin ' the enemy , y ' understand . ' N Jules , he says he hopes for great things from common folks when he comes back  --  ' n then y ' know what he says , Verity ? " Hank looked at her with pride . " Jules says , That 's what 's remarkable about you , Hank . " N then he tells me in a sorta way a ' his own that I 'm a feller as lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can do great things . Yeah , he said that . He actual spoke some such words , he did . " He shook his head , finding it hard to believe Jules Bolduc would speak thus . Verity was proud and pleased . She patted Hank 's hand. 90 " Jules 's great-grandpappy owned all this whole section  --  all a ' Cypress Bend  --  ' n the old feller gave this place its name t ' sorta honor the bald cypress as grows in our swamps . I get t ' thinkin " bout that whilst Jules is a-talkin ' , ' n I think on them tales a ' how his great-grandpappy made his first big money offen the cypress . You 'll see lotsa cypress in the swamps on this here trip we 're a-takin ' . They 're like t ' be draped withen moss , they are , ' n their roots double up ' n push big knobby knees up through the swamp for t ' draw in air . Big ' n tall like t ' old kings they stand , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' n termites . It 'll allus stand strong ' n smooth agin the weather ' n the years . It 'll plumb resist acids ' n such , the lumber cutters tell me . Fine-grained it is ' n of a rich color . " His eyes looked off into nowhere and he went on softly , " Whilst Jules is a-tellin ' me in his own way just what Maw tolt me in her way  --  that I 'm a feller as can mebbe get back t ' Zion  --  I 'm a-settin ' there a-catchin ' the feel a ' that Jules . But I do n't plumb catch it till I 'm most home . " He struck the table with his fist . " God'lmightyl A feller like t ' him a-lettin ' hisself be what he calls a spectator ' ! Helluva note . ' Cause d'y ' know what ? I got ta feelin ' he 's some'at like t ' the cypress hisself . Yeah , strung withen some old dead moss , he is . But still ' n all , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same kind a ' heartwood . " She was enchanted . Music and rhythm were in his speech . " Why , Hank , " she said , " that 's beautiful . I love to hear you talk . " He grinned . " I 'm a describin ' man . " He leaned over the table , put his warm hard hands over her ears , and pulled her gently toward him until their lips met . " I ai n't yet got words enough for t ' be a-describin ' of all yore wonders , " he whispered . He kissed her again . " That 's kissin ' afore lovin ' , " he said huskily . She stood in their little yard , holding her smallest suitcase , enjoying the coming of day while waiting for Hank to drive up from the barn . The first golden feelers of the sun paled the91strong last stars of morning , turning the trees from black etchingsinto living things of green . The sky , seeming conscious of its dignity , had vaulted its ceiling aloofly from low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lowed her morning news of a full udder . Wood smoke from Jules 's kitchens mingled dryly with the night-damp smell of fields . Jules 's hunting hounds began to bark a greeting to their feeder , and the wide country mellowedthe sounds and spread them out thinly . Hank 's big black gelding , Beauty , neighed joyously as he came out of the ( lark barn , his mane tossing prettily as he threw his head within the limits of his reins . The appearance of Hank 's wagon shocked Verity , so different it was from the day of their wedding . No longer was it modestly wearing its tarpaulincover . It flaunted its wares shamelessly . No wonder Hank had been so long getting the thing ready ! A high centerboardreared up from its middle on which were displayed shiny cheap pots and pans , catching the light in their surfaces and tinkling tinnily as they jiggled and swung . Samples of bright oilcloth gleamed here and there like brazen flowers , among samples of less bright calicos , laces , and cheap ribbons . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very pink life-size cardboard baby , clad in real diapers and real bootees , reached a fat dimpled hand for a lace-edged hood . An old buggy top lay folded back against the glass case which .. , 9 " glistened hack of the seat , the iron arms bolted securely to the seat 's sides ! In the glass-fronted case were patented cure-alls , the joint and muscle linaments , powder and rouge , needles , threads , and tapes . Strips of leather with slits buttonholed over the heads of nails driven in the wooden back of the case held all these things in place . In the bottom of the wagon were piled the bolts of material , the boxes , and crates . She had n't minded the wagon on their wedding day and she resolved that she would not mind it now . Hank grinned down at her before jumping to the ground . " Ai n't m ' wagon a daisy , though ! " he exclaimed with pride . " Better'n any store window I most ever saw . Lordy Inc , some92a ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their last cent . Mebbe go in debt . " She could n't take her eyes off the cardboard baby . " Ai n't that little of baby somethin ' ! " he declared . " Funny expression , " she said . " I guess it looks startled . " " Huh ! Lemme tell y ' , iffen ever a baby a ' one a ' my customers gets its feet in shoes , that child 's plumb gon na have reason t ' be startled . " She laughed up at him . " If it 's as bad as that , " she teased , " considering ' how beautiful are thy feet with shoes , 0 prince 's daughter ' maybe you 'd better give away a pair of bootees now and then . Since mothers vote . " She laughed at his amazement , thinking him surprised at her teasing . " Why ai n't I never thought a ' that afore ! One a ' them whole sets a ' clothes ! One t ' any woman minute I see her a-bulgin ' ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Specially will she please me iffen she gets herself ' n all her kin so 's they c'n read ' n write my name . " He backed away from the wagon and looked at it critically . " Yeah , ' n under that there baby I 'm a-goin ' t ' have wrote ' 1f y ' got one a ' these a-comin ' , y ' got his clothes a-comin ' , too . He took her hands in his with a kind of reverence , looked at her admiringly . " So young ' n peart , ' n still so knowin ' . Lord God Almighty always gives me His best . " He touched her hair above her ear , ran a finger along the brim of her small blue hat . " Come , my beloved , " he quoted softly , " let us go forth into the field . Let us lodge in the villages . The mandrakes give a smell , and at our gates are all manner a ' pleasant fruits , new and old , which I have laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picked her up in his arms and held her tightly , possessively , for a second before putting her into the wagon . " Mandrakes , " she said dreamily , " I wonder what they smell like . " Ile climbed in and took the reins. 93 " You ai n't a-honin ' t ' smell ' em , are y ' ? " " Oh , I just wonder whether they 'd smell sweet like apple blossoms or spicy like cloves . " " Cloves ! Well , what th ' hell is mandrakes ? " " Some kind of an herb , I guess . " " Roarin ' thunderbolts ! " he exclaimed . " ' N me a-thinkin ' they was he-ducks ! " Her laughter broke free and sweet . She put her arm under his , her cheek against his shoulder . " Oh , Hank , " she laughed , " I love you ! " " Y ' got the kindlin ' power , Sweetface . Yeah , y ' shore got it . Plumb hate t ' go off from our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " IIe sighed lightly . " Dang that there Jules . Plumb cheated me outen days a ' honeymoonin ' , he did . Funny , the things a man thinks he has got ta do . " The reins slapped Beauty 's rump smartly and the horse rip- pled his shiny skin , lowered his head , and tautened himself for the starting pull in the mud . " Damn mud , " Hank muttered . " Been trompin ' through six inches a ' dust ' r twelve a ' mud all m ' life , seems ' s though . " " Where are we going now ? " " Into Caziyoux swamp . Gon na see Spurge McMenimee . Best trapper ' n ' gator man in the state . Spurge is a somebody extry special . Lotsa these here settlements got just one boss-man . That is , iffen there 's one man as is stronger ' n wiser'n the others . Spurge now , lie 's such a feller . He 's judge ' n jury . He 's the law . He banishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has ' em whipped till clost t ' dyin ' . Or iffen it 's something plumb terrible they draw lots ' mongst the menfolks ' n two ' r three take the sinner into the swamp . Spurge , he 's one a ' my favorite folks . " Negro children called excitedly when they saw Hank 's gor- geous wagon , " Looky dere , looky dere ! Hit 's Mistuh Hank ! " He called each child , handed each a thin stick of pepper- mint candy , beaming and talking while they dug their bare 94 toes into the mud , shy and anxious . Mostly they were wideeyed , skinny-legged , knobby-kneed young things . Taking a tin whistle from his shirt pocket , Hank would blow three shrill blasts at spots along the road where no sign of human habitation could be discerned , open his big tin candy box , and wait , perhaps grunt to Verity , " Have the damdest time a-keepin ' the ants outen this candy . " After a few minutes some ragged children , sometimes black , sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her hurrying , and , if their father worked his own fields , he also came after a bit . Sometimes his sale was a few yards of calico , sometimes only a single row of pins which he tore from a full paper and for which he received four pennies . To each he introduced Verity with a glowing pride , and introduced each customer by name to Verity . She was amazed at his memory . It was late in the afternoon when she met the Cajun Ribidoux family . " You heard I been married ? You ai n't ? Well , this is m ' wife . Yes , sirree , she 's Miz Hank Martin . Sweetface , this here 's Miz Ribidoux ' n her brood . " Pointing out each child , " Emmeline , she 's twelve ; Reuben , he 's ' leven ; Sidney , he 's gettin ' t ' be a fine big feller , too , he 's most ten now ; Josephine , she 's eight ; Alois , he 's seven ; Halley , he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them two little butterballs is Gracie ' n Jacqueline , they two'n three . Where 's the baby , Miz Ribidoux ? He sleepin ' ? " She thought , Somehow Hank manages to make me feel like a queen . Giggling within herself , she added , Queen of one of those silly countries where rulers manage to look dignified on the back of the camels or jackasses . She began to see Hank 's wagon as the countryfolk saw it , an exciting thing of beauty and plenty . Amazement grew in her us she thought how Hank had developed this rich friendliness since he started walking the hills and swamps peddling the pretties his first fourteen dollars had bought . Men greeted him with love as a kinsman who always brought laughter and pleasure ; women greeted him with a love sweetened with an anxious95 yearning to serve him . Older women mothered him and young women from fourteen up adored him . They spent the night in the Ribidoux home , a shamble of splintery boards , opened here and there in inch-wide cracks to the weather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stove and table , Hank and Verity sat with the rest of the family on the flappy , unnailed boards of the low porch with their feet resting on the ground . Hank looked out at the fields . " Ai n't y ' got no cotton , IIilbert ? " he asked . Mr. Ribidoux threw out his hands and shrugged his shoulders . " Boll weevil got him las ' year , yes . " " And this year ? " Flank asked . " No money . No seed . We jus ' about go hongry , thees winter , Hank . Jus ' about , yes . We got our sweetenin ' , though . Cane good . Corn good . Got coupla hogs . But no cotton , no money . Ca n't kill the sow , so we ai n't got much thees winter , no . " A thick weariness clouded his voice . " Too late t ' plant cotton , ai n't it ? " " Uh-uhh ! I like for try ! " he cried . " I ai n't seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , Hank . Fi ' dollar , I get . But if seed I had Mamma and the childrens can follow me an ' walk it into de groun ' . " " You come with me . " I-Tank headed for his cart , followed by Mr. Ribidoux and most of the brood . Digging under the tar- paulin which shielded the wagon 's treasures from the heavy dew , he located a big can . " Gim me a hand , " he said . Together they lifted the can to the ground . Removing the lid , Flank reached in , lifted out a handful of the fuzzy whitish- gray seeds . " Y ' can take m ' word for it , Hilbert . This here 's the best damn seed I could find . How much you need for yore patch ? " Mr. Ribidoux wrung his hands . " No money , Hank , " he wailed . " No money . " " Roarin ' thunderbolts ! Did I say anything ' bout money , Hit- 96 bert ? I 'm a-givin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good , you pay me come pickin ' . Iffen it ai n't no good then you send one a ' the young'uns down t ' my house next spring . Send him in time for the plaintin ' . Iffen I ai n't t ' home , my wife 'll dole it . By God , a man should ought have his cotton patch . " Mr. Ribidoux crossed himself , and the children , watching their father , crossed themselves . " Go on , now , one a ' you young'uns , ' n get a pail t ' put some into , " commanded Hank , " a great big pail , " he called after the screaming , running children . Mrs. Ribidoux hurried onto the porch . " What does ? " she called . " Papa , what does ? " Mr. Ribidoux waved his arms excitedly , jumped up and down . " Mamma , " his black eyes gleamed with a showing of tears , " Hank , he 's give to us cotton seed . Bucket cotton seed . No money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us ! " Mrs. Ribidoux clasped her hands , lifted her eyes to heaven . " Blessed Saint Mary , " she said fervently . Lumbering down the rickety steps , she scurried to Hank and embraced him . " Blessed Hank . A saint you are ! " She laughed and cried . " Come now , we eat . I send all the childrens early this morning fishing . The scacalait we have got for supper . " After supper was eaten the stacked-up pallets were pulled down and spread for sleeping upon the floor of the one-room shack . But one pallet was dragged up a wobbly ladder and laid on the planks which were nailed to the cross rafters at one end of the house . Mrs. Ribidoux opened a cypress box and brought forth some good old patch quilts with great pride . As Verity climbed up the ladder , a wave of sick terror flashed through her . The poverty of all these people struck her suddIenlylike a fever . Sitting on their pallet in the tiny balconylikeloft , Hank took off his clothes with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Verity sat there , stiff and miserable . He rolled over to her , put his head in herOt lulu , and started unbuttoning the collar of her dress . She con-97torted her face into a fierce command to stop . He chuckled . " Ai n't you feelin ' lovin ' ? " he teased , whispering . Tears of embarrassment and utter misery came in her eyes , and Hank was contrite . He sat up and put his arm about her protectingly . " Shush , now , Sweetface , " he whispered . " Shush , now . You should ought a know me well enough by now t ' know I love lovin ' you too much t ' snatch it quick ' n secret agin pryin ' . Lovin ' you 's a ceremony , Sweetface . Just slip outen yore dress ' n let them kids see that party petticoat a ' yourn . They ai n't never seen the like . " Ile kissed her cheek gently . " Then you lay clown '  --  put yore bead i --  the holler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 1 ' 11 hold y ' all still ' n solemn . When we lay that-a-way it plumb gives me the same fine feelin ' I get in church . " It was midmorning and the mist was finally surrendering to the sun which filtered down through the thick-leafed trees . The air had almost the tangible softness of river water and carried in waves and ripples the varying smells . Sunlight dappledBeauty 's back , and when he walked into a spiraling column of gnats he snorted them out of his nostrils , with patient endurance . " Ai n't the woods beautiful ? " said Hank softly . " There 's a freshness a-comin ' from the lake way yonder , ' n the rottin ' logs ' n stumps give a richness like a good , clean manure . ' N over that-a-way where the water stands one ' n two foot high little old insects is a-hatchin ' , ' n them smart little things is a-flutterin ' ' crost the water to find a tree to crawl up till they get plumb uset t ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water lilies ' n hyacinthsis a-growin ' s ' thick ' n heavy a man nigh'bout can lay on ' em t ' dry out ' n study ' r sleep in the sun . " He looked up . " ' N then I like the smell the sun sends down  --  the smell a ' the tree 's top leaves a-bakin ' . Som'at like bread when it 's just a-gettin ' t ' the crustin ' stage in a oven , ai n't it ? " how strange , she thought , that all my senses should be sharpened because of Hank . She had always been intensely 98aware of people and things , and yet life now was brighter , . more hurting , more soothing , vaster . Their road was just a corkscrew path hewn through this jungle , and she tried to look deep into the woods and classify the various shades of green . " Makes one wonder if there really is a life after death , " she said , thinking of her mother . Her mother would have liked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he exclaimed , " I 'm s'prised at you , Sweetface . Why , ' course there 's life after death ! A-course there is . Nature do n't waste nothin ' . The animals eat ' n what do n't go into their flesh they throw outen theirselves for the earth t ' take in . Trees like the pecans ' n such as shed their leaves in fall needs for t ' have them leaves left t ' rot t ' feed their crops a ' nuts ' n leaves . There 's somethin ' in leaves ' n stalks that feeds the earth . " He waved an arm outward . " Take the sugar cane . We need it for sweetenin ' but after we grind them stalks dry a ' their juice we pile up them stalks to rot , ' n then spread ' em out to give the earth a meal . " He turned toward her . " Naw , sir , nature do n't waste nothin ' . Neither did Jesus . He could do miracles ' n He done one with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said gather up the fragments that nothin ' be wasted . ' Well , I allow that when the Lord made the earth , ' n the fish , ' n the animals , ' n give man dominion , He did n't aim that His best work , which was humans , should be wasted . I feel plumb certain shore there 's a way for the souls a ' folks t ' be used after we give our bodies t ' the earth . " " Very few folks have dominion , it seems . " " Ai n't no fault a ' the Lord 's , I do n't reckon . Sometimes I get a-thinkin ' most folks let theirselves get took captives like in Maw 's psalm , ' n they just stay took for whole generations . Lettingtheirselves get wasted liken the psalm says , ' n liken GrammawKelts ' n Maw , fair honin ' for Zion . " The narrow road came to an abrupt end . " Far ' s we can go by wagon , " he said. 99 He blew his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seconds , then blew again and waited . " It 's gon na take Spurge some little spell to get home t ' his whistle iffen he 's out . " The whistle roused some of the birds from their noontime quiet , and a little cheeping chatter came from the trees . Hank blew again , but scarcely had he finished when his answer came . Three long , clear blasts from a whistle like his own . Hank blew one long blast to say that he had heard , then came two short staccato notes from the distant whistle . " Them two means Spurge is a-comin ' , " he explained and jumped to the ground . " We got ta meet him at the edge a ' the swamp . You should ought a have boots over them shoes a ' yoren . But we ai n't got none . " He put a tarpaulin over the high display board , took the pack he had carried on his back before he possessed Beauty and the wagon , climbed into the body of the wagon , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sell at this settlement . Then he removed his shoes and socks , took off his coat , and stuffed all into his pack . He took from the wagon a steel- pronged stick of cane length . " For snakes , iffen we need it , " he said , stuck a long knife into his belt , and lifted his gun from the wagon . " Good gracious ! ! " Verity exclaimed . " This must be a terrible place . And it feels so peaceful . " " Shore , it 's peaceful . It 's got the onliest kind of peace there is in this world . Everything livin ' on everything else ' n what ai n't used in somethin 's belly goin ' back t ' God , ' r mebbe just t ' the earth , liken I said . " He grinned up at her . " The worms has t ' burrow into the ground to hide from the birds , ' n whilst they 're a-burrowin ' they 're a-makin ' holes that lets the roots a ' plants ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' n juices from the ground ' n shoots it up into leaves ' n flowers .

I should mebbe ought a cut back the underbrush so 's the animals wo n't get closet enough t ' scare him . Oh , well , Spurge 'll send som'un ' t ' look out for him , I reckon . " When they reached the edge of the still swamp water hecarried out his pack to a cypress stump , carried her to another , then whistled shrilly and yowled , " Spurge ! Spu-urge ! " " I 'm a-comin ' . " The rich voice sounded quite near . " I Ie 's clear in ' mongst the trees , " said Hank . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yelled Spurge McMenimee , 101 " Hang onto yoreself , man , I a-s'prisin ' you-all with m ' wife . " They heard a long whistle indicating surprise . " Heah you tellin ' , man , " yelled Spurge . Hank laughed . " He ai n't believin ' a word , " he whispered to Verity . Standing in his pirogue Spurge poled his way between the stumps and trees , his eyes fastened in amazement upon Verity . His only garment , a pair of almost legless bib overalls , gave full glory to his wide shoulders , to the splendid muscles of his back and arms and to his fine slim legs with muscles which stood out as though sculptured in bronze . Ile trailed a flat-bottomed rowboat , and his pole was about fifteen feet in length , having on its skyward end a vicious steel hook . Pumping Verity 's hand up and down in a crushing grasp , he balanced the pirogue with an astonishing exactness , keeping the water from shipping over its low sides . " I declare , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everybody in the settlement done gon na be powerful pleasured . " He hesitated , " ' Ceptin ' mebbe Sunny Lou . " " Sunny Lou ? " she asked . " Sunny Lou ! " exclaimed Hank heartily . " How is my little sweetheart , huh ? Lordy me , bet that child has growed a-plenty since last I seen her . " Turning to Verity he said , " That child 's the pm-hest thing y ' ever did sec . She 's thirteen years , now . Reddest hair ever growed on a head . Hangs in waves , it does . ' N not airy freckle on her nose liken most redheads . I call her the Little Flamingo . " " Plumb spoils her , he does , Miz Martin " ; Spurge grinned . " No livin ' withen that young'un fer days after he 's gone . Moons ' round liken a eighteen-year-old after a gone sweetheart . I swan t ' goodness it troubles her maw ' n me som'at . " They settled in the rowboat and Spurge in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to be little boat paths in the marshes . When they reached clear deep water Hank took up the oars of the rowboat and Spurgetrailed . Again at the marshes on the other side Spurge poled them . She saw a settlement of houses built on stilts all on the swamping edge . Some were only tiny shacks , some , like Spurge 's , with little added shacks attached by covered runways . Tiny docks ran out into the water like narrow plank sidewalks elevated on pilings . Everyone in the settlement was out to greet Hank . They whistled and called and yelled at him . Most of them seemed to be screaming questions about money . " You bringin ' us money ? " " You bring us dollars ? " Hank yelled back , " You 're dam tootin ' I brought y ' money , Whitney . " And " Got ta roll t ' choke a ' gator . " She was puzzled , thinking that he had come here to sell goods . Spurge slowed up and pulled alongside a rather better kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down screaming excitedly , " Hank ! Hank ! " was one of the loveliest children she had ever seen . Sunny Lou 's brilliant hair lay in ripples below her shoulder blades , a soft golden bloom was on her skin  --  skin of the thick , soft texture of a sturdy rose . Back of her were her mother , Lula May McMenimee , two younger sisters , and three little brothers . But Sunny Lou shone " she cried . Hank got up on the dock and Sunny Lou threw her arms around him and hugged and kissed him with all her might . " Kiss me , Hank , " she commanded . " You bet , " said Hank and kissed her , but the child kissed him with such fervor that his face reddened . Pulling her arms loose from his neck , he said playfully , " Lordy me , Flamingo , you 're shore clingin ' . " Putting the child aside , he spoke to the other children and to Lula May . " Got a s'prise for you-all . Most knocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife with me . Yes siree , I 'm married ! This is Verity , friends . " Sunny Lou whirled and stared again at Verity . Light hazel102 103eyes that were almost topaz stared while her mother greeted and exclaimed over Verity . Sunny Lou let out a long shriek of pain , whirled on Hank , and beat his chest with her slim young fists . " You allus said I was yore sweetheart ! You allus said you 'd wait for me ! You did ! You did ! " Her father and mother pulled her away from Hank . Spurge 's face was white with embarrassment and shame . Lula May tried to cushion Sunny Lou against her soft bosom and soothe her , but the child beat her off . " You done it , " she screamed at Verity . " You done it ! Y ' ketched him when he was n't lookin ' . Y ' ketched him like  --  like a muskrat , I betcha ! You ketched him in a trap , I betcha , I betcha ! " She sobbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I aimed t ' marry him , someday , Paw , " she chattered . " ' N I aim t ' lay the worst whuppin ' on you that y ' ever got ! " said Spurge fiercely between his teeth . B ' God , I aim t ' break a ' gator pole ' crost yore rump . A-shamin ' us all afore the whole settlement . A-carryin ' on liken a strollop twicet yore age . Now you git  --  git on into the house . I aim t ' blister yore rump tillst it wo n't set y ' fer a whole moon . " Released , Flamingo ran up the narrow dock and into the house crying uncontrollably . ller father wiped the sweat from his face with his bare arm , her mother wiped the tears from her own cheeks with her apron . Hank stood staring after the child , utterly dumbfounded , muttering , " God'Imighty . God- ' Imighty ! " Misery wearied Verity , loading her heart and her arms and legs with dead weights . " Spurge  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " God'lmighty , I 'm purely sorry the Little Flamingo feels liken that . I got a love for her . I shore have . She 's got a fire in her , bright as her hair . I always knowed she was n't no lunk , ' n I should ought a knowed not t ' tell her she was my onliest sweet- heart . Not t ' tease her t ' hurry up ' n grow up for me . " " You ai n't never done her nothin ' but good , Hank , " said Lula 104 May . " Ai n't no fault t ' you , Hank . She jus ' one a ' them fig tin ' fools , liken Spurge . Spurge , he taken it out on ' gatois , is all . ' N then , Sunny Lou , she 's thirteen . I was only jus ' pushin ' fifteen when he swep ' me up t ' a preacher . " " You lyin ' , woman , " accused Spurge . " No , " Lula May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tolt him I was seventeen , I did , ' n all these years he ai n't knowed no differunce . " She half laughed . Hank chuckled . " It purely looks like Sunny Lou is some'at like both her parents . I ai n't a-aimin ' t ' butt in on yore rights , Spurge , but I shore hope y ' wo n't beat the young'un . " Spurge scratched his head . " I hope you wo n't either , " Verity managed to say . " That 's right kindly of y ' , ma'am , " Lula May said gratefully . Inside the little house the sobs of Sunny Lou , who was in the girls ' bedroom , could still be heard . Verity sat primly in a splinteryrocker while Lula May prepared fish and rice for dinner . " You got the lists a ' the skins you-all gim me ? " Hank said . " Done swell , I think , " and he opened his shirt , unpinned a large , thick envelope , tore its flap , and spilled out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spurge 's hand . " Well , what'cha know ! " exclaimed Spurge . " Looky here , Lula May , looky here ! " " Law , law ! " said Lula May . " Got ten cents more a foot for them ' gator skins than that thievin ' trader was a-givin ' y ' . ' N right smart more for the muskrats , too . " Turning to his sons , Spurge said , " Git in yore boat ' n run tell all the folks we 're a-handin ' out money for their catchin 's in ' bout a hour over t ' the church . " As they ate , Hank and Spurge figured out just how much was coming to each man who had sent skins out with Hank . Verity sat quietly , making no effort to talk , unable to eat . " You comin ' t ' the meetin ' , Maw ? " asked Spurge of his wife . She shook her head . " I stayin ' with Sunny Lou . " He nodded . A feeling of distaste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hank talk about Lincoln again , and she knew he would get everyone in this village pledged to give a dollar a year and to spell his name . She hated to stay in this house , but Sunny Lou 's sobs were no longer heard , and perhaps she could sit out on the funny old porch and let the sun and water strengthen her . " May I stay here with you ? " she asked Lula May . " A-course , ma'am , a-course . " Hank was about to protest . She knew he was about to say she should ought a meet all these people . But seeing Lula May 's pleased expression , lie only nodded . After the nu ' . n left , she went outside . She leaned against the pine-hoard post beside the steps and did n't care that the sap was oozing from it , making the back of her dress gummy . She sat there for what seemed like hours , sometimes feeling completelyblank , sometimes remembering the scene with Sunny Lou , sometimes imagining the scene at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people learned he had made a good deal for them . The sun was less than an hour from setting when the screen door behind her opened and closed gently . Looking up she saw Sunny Lou in a fresh little cotton dress , a really lovely shade of muted pink . Lula May stood back of her , smiling and pleased . The child 's eyes were only slightly swollen and she was indeed beautiful to look upon . " Hank Online this , " Sunny Lou said and touched her skirt . Verity thought again that Hank had an eye for color , and usually in remarkably good taste in everything except his own clothes . Then the realization came to her that men 's clothes were awfully patterned and Hank 's love of color could n't be satisfied within the boundaries set for gentlemen . The pink dress completed the picture that was Sunny Lou , the Flamingo , and her yellowish-hazel eyes looked oddly at Verity . " I should ought a be shamed , " the child said , " ' n I am too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't look the least bit ashamed , Verity thought , but she said , " It 's all right , Sunny Lou . " " I did n't mean it when I said you ketched him in a trap liken a muskrat . Liken Maw says , I should ought a have sense enough to know Hank 's a man growed ' n when he called me his little sweetheart he called it to me liken Paw does . " Verity 's heart softened to her and she said more gently and with more meaning , " It 's all right , Sunny Lou . It 's all over and forgotten . " " Yes , ma'am , " replied Sunny Lou , and she smiled at Verity . " I 'd shore like to be a-doin ' somethin ' fer you . Could I mebbe pole y " round the marshes ? " " No , thanks , Sunny Lou . You ca n't handle a boat in waters like these , can you ? " " Oh , yes , ma'am ! Ca n't I , Maw ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where it 's safe ' n she knows all the fine purty places , too . " " That 's splendid , " said Verity . " You 're a-comin ' , then ? " Sunny Lou asked eagerly . Almost too eagerly , Verity thought . " No , thank you , my dear . " Sunny Lou 's arm flew up to cover her eyes . " You ai n't forgive me ! You jus ' a-sayin ' so . You wo n't go with me , ' n I know it ai n't all right . " " It was only that I am so comfortable here , Sunny Lou , " Verity was a little distressed . " But I 'd like to go out on the water , too . Does she really know how to handle the pirogue and keep out of danger ? " she asked Lula May . " She shore does . Spurge trained her good . Now you take good care a ' Miz Martin , " she said , settling the matter . Sunny Lou poled the pirogue expertly around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at Verity in a secret , studying way . The water twinkled with the uncertain light of sun through the thick growth and the shadow of a gaunt , dead cypress draped in its mourning moss was mirrored in the still brown water . The undergrowth was rich and rank , 107the living trees spread their branches and their moss like feather-dripping wings , the dead cypress stumps stood like jagged monuments , and the brown still water guarded its secret as to why it gave both life and death . " Looky back a ' you at yonder hummock , " said Sunny Lou sharply . Verity turned rather gingerly , feeling it to be unsafe to move in the tiny pirogue unless one was expert . A huge alligator lay drying himself in a spot ofd sun . " Good heavens ! " she cried , " an alligator ! " " Yup , " said Sunny Lou , and added , You scairt , ain'tcha ? " " Yes , yes , l am , - Verity admitted . " Pole away from here . Let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she added nervously . " You seen one now , " said Sunny Lou significantly . " There 's a-plenty a " gators right ' round here . " Verity stared at the child . " Why , " she said , almost unable to believe it , " you headed straight for this place ! " " Yup , " said Sunny Lou , " ' n yore plumb scairt . " She pulled her lips into a hard downward line , tears welled up in her eyes , and she poled toward the ' gator . Verity stared at Sunny Lou . The intent which she sensed in the child could n't possibly be ! Numbly Verity 's mind repeated over and over , She 's only thirteen , she 's only thirteen . Then a resounding splash as the ' gator slithered off his hummockand slapped his tail on the top of the water penetrated her mind and shot fear from her stomach to her brain like a scourging fire . She looked back wildly . The huge thing was only eight or ten feet from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunny Lou prodded at the beast 's snout to anger him , to make him fierce , to make him open his mouth wide , as she had seen her father do . The beast opened his mammoth jaws and snapped at the pole , but Sunny Lou jerked it back too quickly for him . His jaws made a reverberating and horriblesound , and he came closer . " Stand up , you outlander , " screamed Sunny Lou. 108Then Verity shrieked with all her might . " Hank ! Hank ! Hank ! " Sunny Lou kept prodding the beast , which snapped again and again in his rage . And then Verity heard flank 's whistle sounding with frantic urgency and she knew Lula May had heard her . The whistle pierced through Sunny Lou and impaled her , terrified and immobile , her magnificent eyes filling with terror . " Paw ! " Sunny Lou uttered the word with a strange , almost stupefied horror . " Pole away from here ! " screamed Verity . " Yup , " said Sunny Lou dully , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The boat tipped and sent them floundering into the water that came almost to Sunny Lou 's shoulders . The soft mucky bottom of the swamp sucked at their feet . " Swim ! " screamed Verity . " Ca n't nobody outswim a ' gator , " said Sunny Lou almost dully . Then , as they heard the ' gator beating the boat with his tail , trying to reach them , Sunny Lou stood as though her legs were paralyzed and shrieked and shrieked . She still held the pole , and Verity jerked her forward and took the pole from her , heading for the cypress knee , the stump of which stood about four feet out of water . She pulled and jerked Sunny Lou after her , the ' gator getting nearer , nearer . They scrambled up on the stump and stood on its jagged uneven top . " Is that hook to catch them with ? " Verity demanded fiercely . Sunny Lou only nodded . " Answer , damn you , " hissed Verity . " Poke it in his throat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept repeating it as though a spring were broken and she could n't stop . The great beast found the same knee of the cypress as they had found and came at them , mouth open hungrily . As though hypnotized , Verity plunged the vicious hook down his throat and let go of the pole . The wild thing flounced and flailed with109the fifteen-foot pole stuck in his throat . The pole struck at them and around them . " Dodge ! " cried Verity . " Poke it in his throat ! poke it in his throat ! poke it in his throat . . . . " and Sunny Lou slumped in a faint onto the jagged points of the stump and began slipping off into the water . Verity knelt , then lay on her stomach , put her arms around Sunny Lou 's waist and held her up . The stump 's points cut in on her stomach and breasts , and then the pole struck her just above the waist and she went Womb all over . She heard the pole strike the edge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brain told her clearly but for that she would now be dead . She heard Il.ik yell in terror for her , and she heard the single well-placed bullet with which Spurge killed the enemy . Their cuts and bruises had been washed and bandaged by Lula May and the old black midwife , Granny Dazy , who was the only doctor in the settlement . And now they sat , Verity and the child , wrapped in clean old patch quilts , their feet in pans of hot water , trying not to look at each other . " But God-damit , Maw , " raved Spurge for perhaps the twentiethtime , " why 'd y ' let ' em go ? " And this time Lula May tried to answer , for the anxiety was over . " Suny Lou been out lotsa times . She knowed how t ' keer for herself . " In spite of her best intentions she let an accusing glance run out toward Verity . Hank sat in complete silence now , his eyes never leaving her face . He 's studying me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether it had happened because of her carelessness , or because she was just green . He could n't think she meant harm to the child . He saw me trying to protect the little devil , she thought fiercely , and twisted in her chair . The stabbing pain in her back above her waistline made her sick with nausea . She was about to speak of it , but Spurge was talking. 110 " ' N I 'm a-thinkin ' there 's more t ' this than is to be seen withjus ' a-lookin ' . " " Why n't y ' tell on me ? " Sunny Lou burbled hysterically , her face contorted with the fresh-coming sobs . " Why n't y ' tell on me ? Why n't y ' tell ? " Verity turned her head . Spurge ran to Sunny Lou and jerked her to her feet . " Tell what ? " he demanded . " I was a-goin ' t ' let the ' gator git her , " she sobbed , " I was  --  I was  --  " Spurge 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pan ; the gasps of her brothers and sisters could be heard through the open door . Flank jumped to his feet and stared down at the child curiously . Granny Dazy groaned , " A chile a ' de debbil , I'se a-gittin ' de preacher . " She took her string of nutmegs from her neck and whirled them around herself to ward off the evil spirits and ran out the door . Many of the villagers had gone to the rescue , making a frenzied exit from the meeting hall , and now they sat quiet and waiting in their pirogues near the McMenimee dock . " Preacher ! Preacher ! " the old black granny yelled , swinging her nutmeg string violently . " Come-y hyah ! Come-y hyah ! " A sympathetic murmur rose from the crowd , for they thought someone was dying . The preacher was too old to join in the hunt and had come to the house to wait with Lula May . He now came up the dock and into the house . " You meant to do murder ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leader of this settlement and the only judge and jury in the community , was demanding of his child . " You meant to do murder ? " A great terror came into Sunny Lou 's face as she began to realize the enormity of the thing . " No , no , I jus ' meant t ' let the ' gators git her , " she sobbed , shrinking down into her bundling quilt . Sobs jerked Spurge 's huge frame . " Y ' know , Sunny Lou , I got ta treat y ' liken any other bad 111person . I cai n't bias t ' y ' causen you 're mine . I cai n't . It ai n't justice . Oh , God , " he cried . " Oh , God ! " " God'lmighty , Spurge . What you a-sayin ' ? " Hank demanded sternly . " Go careful , man . She 's yore young'un , ' n she 's a wonderfulyoung'un . Think , man ! " " It 's her hair , Paw , " said Lula May pleadingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the witch 's hair . It keeps her vain past goodness . " " Pray , preacher , " colmnanded I lank , and Verity knew he was needing time to think this out . She wanted desperately to help this father and mother , and perhaps even this child . " Oh , Lord , " moaned the preacher , " looky down here on us . We-inns got a young'un here as got killin ' in her heart . . . . " Hank grimaced . He tipped up the terrified little face and gave her a reassuring wink and nod . Turning , he studied Spurge 's proud and bitter face . Whatever the answer , it must meet Spurge 's sense of justice , for his word had been law for everyone else and it must be a righteous law for his own as well . " ... ' N bless us with yore wisdom , Lord , Aaa-men . " The preacher rose and hacked his throat and looked at the others uncertainly . " God'lmighty , " said Hank softly . " It come t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vision it was , like to the words spoke to Moses from the fiery bush . She needs learnin ' , ' the voice said . She needs learnin ' , she does . She 's liken to the captives in a strange land . She 's a-cryin ' t ' get back t ' Zion . She 's liken t ' the captives that wanted t ' get back t ' Zion . " N I see plain that it 's a right good answer . " He put his hands on Spurge 's shoulders , stopped , thinking out his words carefully . " Banish her to a Catholic convent , Spurge . They 'll take young'uns in some places for nothin ' . God , man , iffen she was mine I 'd fair be bustin ' with pride for her . She 's got guts . B ' God , she 's one as has the guts t ' get back t ' Zion . Banish her to a Catholic convent , Spurge . That 's justice . " " We-uns ai n't Catholics , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what of it ! " exclaimed Hank . " The Methodists ai n't got no schools . They all too clang pore . " The preacher cleared his throat ostentatiously . " That 's a right fine idee , " he said , trying to sound authoritative . " Give her to the Catholics . " Spurge looked from one face to the other , then stood before his daughter to pronounce judgment . " Please , Spurge , " said Verity gently , " please . . . " But Hank motioned her to silence . " Sunny Lou , I 'm a-sentencin ' y ' , " he choked . " Sunny Lou , we got ta give y ' t ' the Catholics . ' N yore hair is t ' be cut clost t ' yore head ' n what 's left on yore head is t ' be blackened with yore Sunday shoe polish . " The child clutched at her hair wildly . " No ! Oh , please , no ! " Turning from her , Spurge walked out of his house to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell them about any other miscreant . " Shush yore cryin ' , Little Flamingo , " whispered Hank . " Shush now . This here 's purely yore lucky day . Yore hair 'll grow in jus ' liken it is now . ' N you 'll have learnin " n be a somebody . " The child looked at him and believed every word . And the child 's mother looked at him and worshiped him . And Verity thought , He 's a great man , and wanting to touch him , she leaned forward and gasped in pain . Lula May looked at her sharply and helped her to rise . " I 'm a-takin ' y ' t ' bed , " she said . Verity nodded . Verity sat on the edge of the bed and Lula May plumped the pillows . " Vision , he says he 's got , " she said softly . " But I knowed he ai n't . I knowed he 's m ' onliest hope n ' I kep ' my eyes on him . I seen him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How right you are , " Verity whispered , and stifled a groan . " I 'll fetch some a ' Hank 's linament ' n rub that there bruise the pole give y ' . " " No , no , " said Verity . " My ribs are broken , I think . " 113Gently Lula May pressed around the spot . Convinced , shestood back and looked at Verity with something of worship . " ' N y ' never tolt ! " " We ca n't let Spurge know , " said Verity . Lula May nodded thoughtfully . " Granny Dazy 'll know what t ' do fer them ribs . " Her eyesglowed with a dangerous resolution . " I 'll steal some a ' Spurge'sskins . . . I 'll steal ' em from somebody else , even  --  ' n I 'll bribea shet mouth in Granny Dazy . " The picture of Spurge having to deal out justice to anothermember of his fat lily terrified Verity . " Good Cod ! " she gasped , tortured with pain and beginning to feel as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You will not ! Send flank to me , " she commanded ; " I 'll have Hank bribe ashut mouth in old Granny Dazy . " Lula May stood before her , struggling for words , and finally they came . " You 're mebbe good ' nuff for t ' marry up with Hank , after all , " she said and turned to leave , hesitated , and came back to defend her child . " Y ' should n't ought a think there 's a somethin ' wrong with m ' pritty one  --  m ' Sunny Lou , ' n God ! I 'm gon na miss her  --  jus ' cause she loves Hank do n't mean she got some- thin ' wrong with her . There 's a-plenty got their hearts busted ' count a ' you . A-plenty , I c'n tell y ' .

He 's got th ' kindlin ' power , that 's all . " " The kindlin ' power ! " She was amazed , since it was what Hank had said of her . " The kindlin ' power , " said Lula May firmly . " Some got it little , but Hank , he 's got it great big ' n special . Hank , he 's one a ' them as has got the power t ' kindle the fire as dreams is made of . He purely has , " she said softly . She stood a second trying to study it out , then went on , " He c'n kindle a dream in men , he can . They borry a stoutness from114 115him , ' n they wants t ' do big things fer him . ' N he c'n kindle a dream in the hearts a ' womenfolks , too . He c'n kindle the same dream in them as he can kindle in the menfolks ' bout money ' n schools . But women is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them things as they thinks is worth their lovin ' . God only give us one way t ' do it , " she said simply , " ' n so women lusts fer a man liken Hank . " Lula May 's wisdom beat at her with the fierceness of the ' gator pole . It struck at her from every direction and she could n't dodge it . I 've got it little . Just for Hank 's warmth , perhaps . But Hank , he 's got it great big ' n special . ' N women lusts fer a man liken Hank ; he c'n kindle a dream . He c'n kindle a dream . . . . " I 'll fetch Granny Dazy , " said Lula May. 6 lJ Hank 's first big battle was well organized and well executed , and it should have proved the man 's caliber to the entire state . But editors ignored the most dramatic , the most indicative event since the emancipation of the Negro . Yes , in my opinion , Hank Martin 's manning o f @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had never worn shoes , men who had never hoped for anything , whose only treasure was the shotgun or the rifle by which they killed the only meat they ever ate  --  except , perhaps , an occasional home- butchered pig  --  came into the towns and villages and took over the gin mills . And men were killed , two dying right in Hank 's own dooryard , but . . . . THE DAY the Little Flamingo was turned into a clipped and terrified black crow by the ugly magic of scissors and shoe blackening and taken by her father in his pirogue , via lake , lagoons , and river , to the good Sisters of St. Joseph , was also marked by being the first and only day in Hank 's life when he was grateful for the still muddy roads . IIe carried Verity from the boat to the wagon , trailed by three men from the settlement who carried Hank 's pack , and the great bundles of pelts which were the winter catch . The 116 guard Spurge had sent to care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had sprinkled his hair and his fishy clothes with Cologne and perfumes . " Goddam , boy , " Hank swore at him genially . " You got the stinkin'est carcass ever walked a swamp on its own legs . " " I got them stinks fum outen back a ' thet glass thar , " said the grinning boy . " Not all a ' them , you did n't , " exclaimed Hank . " Not by a damsite . " And as they started home , he called back to the men , " Troll that young'un back a ' yore boats . Wash the smell a ' his paw back int ' him else'n his maw 's gon na think she 's drawed one outen another flock . " Their laughter was full-timbered and hardy like the forest in which they stood waving their farewells . " Thank God the road 's still some'at muddy , " said Hank . " Iffen this blackjack was dried in ruts harder'n buckshot y ' could n't ' a rode it with them ribs . How you feelin ' , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'd be all right . Granny Dazy ( lid a good job , I guess . I 'm pretty comfortable . " The terror of that experience would live in her to her dying day . She shudderedand drew close to Hank . " Forget Sunny Lou , " he advised . " It was plumb her lucky day . " He laughed softly , teasingly . " Here I married me a lady . A lady , mind . A lady t ' guide me right . A lady what should ought a be above the low , mean dirt a ' politics . ' N dang if she ai n't the very one as forces me t ' pay out the first bribe ever I paid in m ' long ' n successful career in politics ! " IIe added with mock piety , " Ai n't you plumb shamed ? Here I got ta take you home ' stead a ' t ' th ' city . ' N here y ' are with ribs busted in y , ' n with a bribe a-weightin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lord , looky down on us . Weunsgot a sinner here . " " Hank Martin , if I didnk have these broken ribs , I 'd lay Beauty 's whip across you until you could n't sit for a whole moon . " Realizing then that she had copied the angry Spurge 's Words , she blushed. 117Laughing at her , Hank said , " I swan iffen I do n't think you 're a-soundin ' plumb fierce . " " Well , I feel fierce . Such a country ! Such people ! I really think I should take Picayune Potter 's advice and start using a crowbar . " He roared with laughter . " Why , you dang little pepper pod ! You 're shore goin ' t ' be a somethin ' t ' see iffen ever you ripen t ' red hotness . " " You subject me to a few more Flamingos , " she said scathingly , and 1'l1 ripen fast ! And you can believe that ! " she added with great emphasis . " ' N I do believe it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zestful laugh meagered the many small songs of the forest . " I.low much did you have to pay that black old rascal ? " Verity asked . " Could n't pay but the first half a ' her bribe yesterday . " " Well , how much did she ask ? " " One dollar cash money ' n I was t ' deliver int ' her gran ' - daughter 's hand this here packet . " He took a small folded paper from his pocket . " ' N I was to say t ' her that her Granny Dazy send it ' n that it 's a new-life charm . ' N I 'm t ' tell her she 's t ' wear it atween her breasts . " " how perfectly silly ! " " Mebhe , " said Hank . " Mebbe not . Granny Dazy does a right lively little bizness in gris-gris . Most a ' the niggers hereabouts is some touched withen a bit a ' voodoo ' n mebbe a bit a ' them French-talkin ' niggers . " Gris-gris , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' cast a spell . But this ' n is gon na cast a good spell , " he said comfortably . " Granny Dazy says this here black gal done went t ' a plumb splendiferous revival where there was a no-'count , travelin ' spell-castin ' preacher . ' N this here preacherman'sso good the gal  --  her name 's Selah Marie  --  just follered him . But somehow she got herself a young'un . ' N the preachermanrun off ' n now the young'un is terrible sick with the miseries'n Selah 's still a-mournin ' for the preacher-man . So I gotta118give her this new-life charm . Some bribe you got me ' a-payin ' , ai n't it ? " He laughed . Verity looked at the little package . " What 's in it ? " " Open it up ' n we 'll see . " Carefully she unfolded the paper , and two tiny wings glistenedtheir green-black iridescence through a sprinkle of dirt . " Huh ! Hummin'bird wings ' n goofer dust , most likely , " said I lank . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dust offen a grave . " Carefully Verity folded the paper over the charm and handed it back to Hank . " I shore do n't see where that nigger 's a-stayin ' . I 'd ' a swore I knowed every person that lives offen this road . But old Granny says to start watchin ' in about what would be eight hours ' easy walkin ' from the swamp . Says there 's four pecan trees on one side a ' the path ' n two magnolias on t' other side ' n a cottonwood . " The sun was high and stirring a boiling heat which struck them like puffs of hot , steamy air from a passing engine whenever they moved from shade into sun . All the little creatures of the grasses and the trees lulled into their noonday quiet . " There 's a right fine hush in the world this time a ' day . The critters gives the world t ' man ' n lets the poor fools sweat at their work in the sun . Long ' bout now we ought a be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour later when Hank said , " Lissen . " At first the sound was like a throb , something felt rather than heard . " Yonder 's the trees we 're a-lookin ' for , " said Hank softly . " It must be that Selah a-singin ' . She shore sounds mournful . A body c'n plumb hear the pulse a ' heartbreak . I 'd like t ' hear her in a right joyful jump-up song . " There was only a slither-through space between the bushes to indicate a path . They sat quietly listening : 119 " Dey nailed His hands ' n dey nailed His feet , An ' de hammers wuz heard in Jerusalem street , An ' dey nailed alongside Him two thievin ' snakes Dat dey foun ' a-hidin ' in de high canebrakes. 0 Angel , roll away dat stone , Wing dis'un home , Wing dis'un home . " " Lift me down , Hank , " said Verity ; " I 'm going , too . " He hesitated a second , then lifted her from the wagon and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw a fat young colored woman seated on the ground swaying from side to side as she sang her hymns . With fierce tenderness she held a bundled baby against her bosom . Her wide face uplifted to the sun was wet with her tears and wet with the sweat which seeped out from the edges of her woolly hair . She squatted before a three-sided slattern shelter which had once been built for some farm animal , probably a mule . But the inside of the shelter , Verity noted , had been brushed clean of dirt and cobwebsand the " floor " was thickly laid with fresh green branches . " Selah , " Hank called , " Selah Marie ! " Selah Marie 's singing stopped and she jerked her head around , startled . " Yore granny sent us , " Hank hastened to add , " Old Granny Dazy sent us . " IIe held out the packet . " Old Granny asked me t ' give this t ' you . She said I was t ' tell you it 's a new-life charm ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 'll bring y'all new life , yore Granny says . " But as Hank held out the charm Selah shook her head and did not reach for it. " 01 ' Granny too late , " she said , and swaying from her hips she rocked her child and wept . Sympathy tightened Verity 's throat . She put a hand on Selah Marie 's shoulder . " It is never too late for new life , Selah . You and your baby come to Cypress Bend with us . We have a wagon and you can 120ride with us . Is something wrong with the baby ? He is n't cry-ing . " " He daid . " Softly Verity said , " I 'm sorry , Selah . But you ca n't stay here . Would n't you like to come with us to Cypress Bend and have a funeral for him in the Colored Methodist Church ? " " Dey would n't , " Selah choked . " He bo'n in sin . " And she rocked in her suffering . Verity did n't know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winked at her . " Born in sin ! " he exclaimed . " Hear you talkin ' , woman ! Why , that there pickaninny a ' yoren was borned just liken everybody else in this world was borned . Jesus said , Let little childern come unto me . ' Jesus shore did n't bother t ' say their folks hadda be married up . Now a young'un 's paw can mebbe be a sinner . But a young'un 's maw just purely ca n't be a sinner . No , sirree ! Them long nine months a ' uncomfort ' n pain plumb washes t ' nothin ' all the pleasure times y ' got with his paw . I 'm a-tellin ' y ' that baby was n't horned in sin . " He held out Granny Dazy 's new-life charm . Selah 's eyes looked up at Hank , not quite daring to hope . " Is you tellin ' de Lawd 's truf ? " " I shore am ! " he replied firmly . One of Selah 's black hands took the charm and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raise up , woman , " commanded Hank , " ' n claim that there new life . ' Cause you been washed whiter'n snow . " " Whiter'n snow , " she murmured , " whiter'n snow ! " " Come on now , woman . That congregation gon na be plumb proud to give yore baby a fine funeral ' n proud to have y ' ' mongst ' em . " Selah stood . She looked at Verity . " You wants me , Mizzes ? " she asked politely , hopefully . " Very much , " said Verity , sincerely , simply . " I is comin ' , den , " and she followed them to the road . Seeing the wagon , she gasped over its gay colors. 121 " Is you Mistuh Hank Martin ? " she asked . " That 's me , Hank Martin . " She shook her head in wonder . " 01 ' Granny shu ' fix up fine chawms , " she said with awe . Then she climbed into the back of the wagon and began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and little soapy flecks of lather began to show on Beauty 's hide . " Purely looks like I 'm a-goin ' t ' be a-payin ' Granny 's bribe the rest a ' m ' life , mebbe , " Hank whispered . " Iffen I know nig- gels , that husky darky 's done took us for her white folks . ' N it 's a compliment , too , seem ' we ai n't what niggers calls quality . " Verity slipped her hand under Hank 's arm . Her ribs hurt some , but the stabs of pain seemed only exclamation marks emphasizing an inward peace . " Ai n't it great , " said Hank , " us here a-ridin ' , content ' n sweatin ' in the sun ! " A little content crept into Selah , too , for she crooned a go- to-sleep song : U Lawd Jesus got a moon round His haid , m-uum , um-uum , rockaby , But lil ' Lawd Jesus a babe liken yo ' , Um-uum , um-uum , rockaby .. .. ' Content rode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . Selah took to the ways of polishing a house and was a genius at making an oven do right by her food . But her early training in the field stayed with her and she was proud of it . The following year , when the cold rains of early spring were drawn back up by the sun , making clouds of earth mist , she held her strong black hand , fingers outspread , before Verity 's face , and said , " I'se got a green hand , I has . An ' I is a-plantin ' wid it , Miz Verity . Turnips an ' cabbage an ' beans an ' all dem t'ings . An ' a veg'table pear vine usn should have fo ' ourse'ves . An ' a cane patch , too . Usn make our own surrup , then . " " You ca n't do all that , can you , Selah ? " Verity asked . " Yassum , I can . An ' keep dis 111 ' of house , too . You is busy 122 wid teachin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wid yo ' prettifyin ' de yawd wid flowers . " At this point a cloud passed over her face . " Usn ought a have us a baby . Usn ai n't got nothin ' t ' count on ' ceptin ' Mistuh Hank , his comin 's an ' goin 's . Mens is fine and usn got a need fo ' ' em , I reckons : ; Nothin ' lak de way mens needs womens , though , don ' seem lak . Mistuh Hank , now , how you know what he doin ' all de time he gone ? " " That will do , Selah ! " Verity exclaimed . " Do n't you ever say such a thing again . " But the blood ran fiercely to her face , for she knew what Selah was thinking and she knew , too , that Selah wished to protect her against any hurt . " Mens is mens , " Selah said firmly and turned away still talking . " Usn ought a have us a baby . Cai n't count on no man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de closes ' . " Yes , Verity guessed what troubled Selah and later she knew . One warm evening she sat leaning against her oak tree feeling a need for Hank when she heard the voices of Selah and " Brother " Tape Dilton , who was escorting her home from prayer meeting . " You know dat floozy woman whut jus ' jive our chu'ch ? " Selah asked . Tape was as thin as Selah was wide and his voice was deep as a bullfrog 's . " Y'all means dat one fum Mentoola where de lumber camp at ? " he croaked , low and musically . " Uh-huh . Dat one . You know whut she say w'en I say I is with Mistuh Hank ? " " Huh-uh . Whut ? " " She say she cooks at dat camp . An ' she say folkses pow'rful crazy ' bout Mistuh Hank . Mens an ' womens . She say mens jumps an ' hollers an ' womens hollers an ' follers . She say de womens jes ' plumb git dat lolly-gag look . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good 's St. John or St. Peter , or certain sLu ' he good 's Elijah . She say her boss-woman say Mistuh I Link purely got hissef a chariot a ' fire , too , she say . Uumminip ! " Selah groaned . " How a man lak dat gwine stay pure123true an ' good ' nuff fo ' Miz Verity ? You reckon he pure true an ' him gone t'ree , fo ' , mebbe five moat 's at a time , huh ? " Brother Tape cleared his throat with profoundness . " Sister Selah , I disliken de way yo ' speaks . A-co'se a man stay true w'en he find his own true love . A-co'se he do . Cullered an ' w'ite , dey stays true . " Giggles burbled from Selah as she jabbed Brother Tape 's thin ribs with a powerful elbow . " Go long wid you , " she said coyly . " You is declarin ' dat ' cause you is courtin ' me . " Verity rose and walked through the night to the top of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she could , she could n't lose the words of Lula May McMenimee . She told herself she was unfair , that it was the same quality which might take IIank to success . Did n't his charm lie in his driving power ? She loved him as he was . Still , always to hear your husband discussed , always to see that others , many others , felt they had an almost personal life with him , was sometimes hard to endure . But Hank was Hank . The front door of Cypress Manor opened and Jules stood there , his fine long lines darkly sculptured by the light within . Loneliness grasped her and wrung out a cry for a friend . " Jules ! " she called , and she had never addressed him by his given name before . " Verity ? " Then Ile saw her . " All , Verity , my dear . . . " Quick life came to him and he ran across the gallery and under the magnolias across the dewy meadow . Always before she had been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , " she said , " I suddenly felt that you were my friend and I called Jules ' before I thought . " " And I answered Verity , my dear , ' because that is how I always speak to you in imagination . " He laughed , a little confused , a little apologetic . Startled , she exclaimed , " Oh ! " " It 's quite all right . Quite all right . Why , Hank has called me a damned onlooker , a blasted celibate . I am civilized , you124know . Often I think I 'm too civilized . Else I woiilcl catch into my own existence a little of the fierce under-throb of this countryin which I was born . Perhaps I was too long away . Will you walk with me ? " " Fierce under-throb , " she said , " I 'm half afraid I 'm catching it a little . " " Perhaps . " He smiled . " But you are directly exposed to it . " " You mean Hank , of course , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Admiration came into his voice . " He has a remarkable mind . Amazing memory . Have you noticed that he remembers everything he reads in those books of his ? In no time at all I am starting him on law . " " That 's wonderful , Jules , " she said , feeling comfortable and snug again . " When Hank calls me an onlooker , he is only repeating what I have called myself . I should not resent it . But Hank makes me sound so useless . " He laughed a little . " But what would Hank do without you ? You 're wonderful , Jules . Just wonderful . So kind and helpful . I always feel better when I look out my window at the big oak and knoll because I know you 're just beyond . " " Just beyond , " he repeated , his voice hardly louder than the thought . " What , Jules ? " " Beautiful night , " he said . " Wonderful to be a part of it with you . She studied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child , " I like you , Jules . " Pleased surprise wiped out the cynic and for an instant gave him the fine eagerness of one who has only to reach out and pluck his slice of life . Then slowly his old one-sided grin came hack . " Thank you , my dear . I often think about the emotion we call like . ' I like you , too , which means that I enjoy your com pany , enjoy your mind , have a fine respect for you , approve125of all you are and of all you show signs of becoming . " He shrugged . " Odd , is it not , that we can love someone whom we do not like ? And yet completely , thoroughly like someone whom we do not love ? Only the very fortunate are blessed by loving whom they thoroughly . like , whom they thoroughly approve . And yet  --  that , too , can be unhappy . " " How perfectly ridiculous , " she laughed . " No one with any sense at all would marry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ According to that , ninety-nine per cent of all adults would have to he classed as moronic . No , I prefer to believe they are so blinded by some bright need of nature that they can not read the signs right . " " Oh , you ! " she exclaimed impatiently . " Why do you always have to put people in classes ? Do n't you ever see anyone as an individual ? " " A very few . " " Everyone is an individual to Hank . He sees everyone 's problemsas different . You know , it 's really wonderful . " " Indeed ? I thought they were all voters . " The taunt hurt her , pushed at her throat , and shoved the fine sense of friendship outside her . The feeling of aloneness pressed in on her and she turned from him . " Good night , Mr. Bolduc , " she said , then thinking the words stiff and foolish , she repeated , " Good night  --  Jules , " and ran toward home . " Verity  --  Verity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touched her with a soothing softness , like the air she stirred with her running . The hurt of aloneness lifted and she became a part of the universe , loving the feel of feet wet with dew  --  dew that made the earthy growths send up their perfumes  --  loving the feel of her body moving through air and space , loving the feel of stars about her head as the lightning bugs turned themselves on and off for her like carefree comets off their orbits . Over toward home one bug stayed lighted with a strange126steadfastness , and then it moved , not jumpily , but swinging slightly and low to the ground . A lantern being carried from the barn ! " Hank ! Hank ! " she called . The lantern lifted high and swung wide . " Hank ! Hank ! " and still no answer . Her being forgot the dew and the air and the stars and prayed , Let it be Hank . But the lantern light was small and the barn shadow deep , and her eyes grew misted as she ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she cried , " answer me ! " " Lord save us , " he said reverently . " Lord save us ! " She stopped , waiting to see his outline detach itself from the blackness . " If I 'm not dreaming you , come here quick . " " You ai n't a-dreamin ' me  --  ' n stand right where y ' are . Do n't move for a minute . I been a-dreamin ' you , though , all these weeks . But like allus , you 're finer'n I can dream , a-standin ' there in yore white dress with yore hair a-managin ' t ' glitter with nothin ' but starlight ' n bugs for it to reflect . " He sighed and came slowly out of the shadows . " Sh ! Do n't move , " he said . " Lord , it 's like givin ' a man a chance t ' walk soft ' n sure right through the gate a ' heaven , ' tliouten even rousin ' Saint Pete t ' give a body the grillin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why did n't you answer me the first time I called ? " she demanded , but stood still in her pose . " Lord , Sweetface , there was so much joy in yore voice it plumb stunned me . So much joy , I dass n't think it 's meant just for me . It purely turned me humble , ' n I think on how thirst is the world for joy . So I did n't grab it . I let it go by for the world t ' lap up , like the generous feller I am . But I ai n't too generous . I says t ' myself , I says , Iffen it 's meant for you , there 'll be another gourdful a ' joy for you t ' quench yore thirst on . ' Yes , sir , that 's what I told myself . " Standing before her now , he reached out a hand and ran a 127finger down the line of her cheek . Catching his hand she held it against her breast . " Darling , darling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things you say but I ca n't put them in words the way you can . Oh , I wish I could ! " " I 'm content iffen you just do the feelin ' , " and laughing softly he pulled her to him . She lifted her face , but he said , " I ai n't fitten . Got two weeks ' sweat ' n dirt a-scalin ' me liken a scurf . There 's times when the sweat ' n dirt a ' roads ' n fields mixes right ' n fitten with lovin ' . But there 's somethin ' diff'rent ' bout tonight  --  with you a-eoniin ' , ruuuin ' to me through the night , acallin ' in ' name . I could purely feel the throb a ' God a-beatin ' in the world . I purely could . " Listening to IIank she half expected to hear a great heartbeat . But she heard the frogs gargling and the katydids rubbing their wings to make songs for their ladies , and saw the fireflies darting swiftly about as though hunting their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " That it 's unfair that only male katydids can sing , and only male lightning bugs fly  --  and wondering if I was a wingless mate . " " Hank 's little glowworm , " he chuckled . " It shore pleasures a male critter mightily to get near home ' n see his mate aglowin ' for him in the dark . Great feelin ' , it is ! " They laughed and she felt precious and silly . " Do n't like this here dirt , but there 's nothin ' like too much preparation to dull the sharp edge of a man 's honin ' . " Looking about , his eyes rested on the trough beside the pump . " That 's the stuff ! " Running to it he started peeling off his clothes . " That there trough makes a plumb perfect bath tub . " " Selah 's in her house . She might see you . " " Well , I ai n't nothin ' but a growed-up baby . She 's seen lotsa babies . " Leaning toward her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kitchen door , Sweetface , ' n go to yore bed ' n wait , a-glowin ' . " 128Verity knew the very next morning that she was different . Within her was an odd content with herself , a feeling of cleannessof spirit , a feeling which reminded her of Hank 's churchy hymn words " washed whiter'n snow . " Smiling at her foolishness , she still could not cease to be aware of it . And with the content was a sense of fulfillment , a quiet willingness to wait on time for another season . Walking toward the village with Hank at her side , watching the play of shadows and light upon the earth , and feeling the quick heat of the sun when a cloud rolled from it , she toyed with the idea of telling Hank that she believed she was a mother . But his thoughts were all of seeing the village folk and telling them of his plans for thwarting Mr. Robert Castleberry , come picking . She thought perhaps it was nature 's rule that a woman should have this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A few weeks in which to make her child her very own . Perhaps it was the only time given a woman to possess her child before sharing it with another , before giving it to the world . Yes , she would wait . And anyway , perhaps she was only imagining . Hank had sent Selah into the village to tell Tim of his arrival and to have as many on hand as could come . He was excited . " I 'm a-tellin ' y ' , Verity , I got a way to plumb fix all the Black Skimmers as are short-weightin ' . Just wait 'll you hear what I clone in the capital . By God'lmighty , I 'm gon na fix that thievin ' Castleberry crowd ' n them Newtons , too . " " But are you sure they are short-weighting ? " " A-course I 'm sure . Hell , you ca n't get the same story from everybody for years on end ' thout there being some truth in it . ' N I 've stood ' n watched ' em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bag by bag . " His face glowed with purpose . " God'lmighty , Verity , you realize I got nigh to four thousand followers in my Hank Martin Organization in just this here one Near ? " " Four thousand ! " " Four thousand ! Yes sirree , ' n most ' f ' em ai n't never voted. 129When they git to the polls they 're plumb gon na be a s'prise vote t ' every of-timey politician in the state iffen I can find a way . But you just wait 'll you hear ! " His stride quickened . " Not so fast , Hank . " " Looky there . There 's some mules ' n wagons tied . Must be they sent for some folks in the country . Hurry up , Sweetface , I do n't wanta be leavin ' you behind ! " There were quite a few wagons tied in front of Tim 's shop , and two more were driving up ; folks afoot were heading toward the place . Smoke rolled up from the shop and as they drew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Sophy 's a-bakin " n a-orderin ' folks about to beat hell , I bctcha , " Hank laughed . " Ai n't it a marvel to be me ' n have folks love me this-a-way ! God'lmighty , it 's purely a marvel ! " " Hank , " she laughed , " you 're so utterly lacking in modesty . . , in every way . " " Modesty , hell ! " he howled . " That there dictionary I been a-studyin ' words in says modesty is puttin ' a low estimate on yore own capabilities , bein ' bashful ' n shy . ' N then another definition it gives is observin ' the proprieties a ' sex . " He grinned down at her . " Now , I 'm a-askin ' you straight  --  you ever seen anybody get someplace in this here world a-goin " round shy , liken he has got ta hide luisself ? A-sayin ' he ai n't no good ? Why , accordin ' t ' that , Jesus Christ was the most unmodest man there ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father are one . ' I feel a greatness in me ' n by God'lmighty , I do n't care who knows it ! " She only laughed and he half shook her . " And what about the proprieties of sex ? " she teased . " Why , there ai n't no such things . Only proprieties there can be is to be a man liken God made you . ' N welcome the consequencesa ' yore pleasures . " He laughed chummily and squeezed her arm . " Mebbe a feller ought a even go so far as to be grateful he do n't just have them consequences come on him ' thouten no pleasures a-tall. " 130His words gave her an almost smug feeling of well-being and confidence , and she laughed gaily . He sniffed the air . " Now there 's Sophy 's cakes ' n rolls . M ' belly needs fillin ' again . Ai n't it wonderful that I got a taster that makes eatin ' a pleasure ? " He stopped and bellowed : " Sophy ! So-o-phy ! Tim ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , friends ! " Hank howled . They shouted their greetings and some came to meet him , among them Tim and Swith . Tim , so mighty in body ; Swith , so frail , so wishful . " I ca n't leave m ' bakin ' , Hank , " Sophy screamed and waved a batter-dripping spoon at him . " Hank , Hank , my boy ! " said Tim , embracing him . " Air y ' fine ? A-course y ' are . By the Lord-Harry , we 're shore plumb glad to be a-seem ' of y ' ! Been gone nigh onto five months this time , ai n't y ' ? " " I shore have , Tim . Too clang long . " Turning to Swith he took the bony , birdlike hand in his own and looked down on the little man fondly . " How 're y ' , Swith ? How 's the treasurer of my home organization ? " " Ask him instead , how is the treasury , " Picayune suggested , puffing and wheezing . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Swith 's eyes grew watery , and pride made him hesitate on his words almost to the point of stuttering . " I  --  it 's a-bulgin ' , Hank . We 're in our second year now ' n we got one thousand six hundred ' n forty-eight dollars , we have ! " " What d'y know , " said Hank slowly , " what d'y know ! Does Tat mean a even eight hundred ' n twenty-four members has paid for two years ? " " Nope , " said Swith , " it means a lotta folks ai n't paid for this year yet . But they will , " he added hastily . " They will . We got time hundred ' n sixty-three members . They live all through the parish . " I lank stared at Swith with respect . " God'lmighty ! " he said131chokily , " God'lmighty ! Who 's been a-gettin ' all them mem-bers ? " " Swith , " replied Tim . " That man 's been a-troddin ' the roads some'at like you uster . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body liken mine . He should ought a have a horse . " Turning to Swith he placed his hands on Swith 's shoulders and asked , " I low you been a-livin ' ' n eatin ' , Swith ? How you nlainatiin ' yore keep ? " " Oh , I ai n't tetehed a Icuiiv ' a ' the organization money ! Not a picayune , I ai n't , " he declared quickly . " But you should ought a done just that , " declared Hank . " The laborer is worthy of his hire . You 're plumb worth it , Swith . " The great blue eyes looked up worshipfully at Hank , his frail body shaking with emotion . " No ! No ! " Frantic denial rang in his voice . " No , I could n't . Not a picayune . Every penny of it has got ta go fer that hope to git the riches divided . That 'd make it a right purty world . " Tears came into his eyes . " But you got ta eat ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I declare you are . You got ta eat . " " I eat . " Swith 's voice was full of pride and determination . " You looky here , flank . " Wiping his eyes on the back of his hands he looked around . " Sec yonder blackbird in the pecan tree far side a ' Tim 's house ? lIe 's a-scttin ' way out to the right . " They scanned the tree . " Nope , " said Hank , " ca n't spot him . " " IIe 's there , " said Swith , and picking up his gun , which had been propped against him , butt on the ground , he swung it to place in a flash . " You 'll see him drop , " he said , and fired . A little black speck fluttered to the ground . " See ? " Swith asked . The men whistled in admiration . " I shore did , Swith . Dang if I did n't allus think you had weak eyes . " " Nope . I got eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Swith smiled up at Hank . " You see , I eat when I need to . " 132 " Well , you rate a horse , Swith . Dang if y ' do n't . Come on , now , I got lotsa things to say . " The news of the treasury of the " home " organization meant a lot to Hank . It meant , as he told his friends , that there was money to do the first job he planned to do . Verity sat on a rough plank seat listening in amazement . " Now , here 's m ' plan , " said Hank as he warmed to his subject . " Throughout these five parishes , all the local gin mills is owned by Castleberry ' n his crowd or by the Newtons . Liken I 've said afore , friends , they 're Black Skimmers . The world is full a ' Black Skimmers ; but this here Hank Martin Organizationis pledged t ' help the little fellers as the Black Skimmers can swaller up ' thouten even lessenin ' their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ' N here 's our first step t'ward gettin ' the little fellers their rightful share  --  t'ward keepin ' the little fellers outen their gullets a piece longer . " His voice hung in air , suspended there with hopes . Sophy 's tin cups were no longer rattling . Only the fire in the forge and Jenny 's twins dared make a sound . " We 're a-goin ' to have hundreds of weights made . Weights of iron for t ' test all the gin scales hereabouts . Tim here , " turning , he pointed at Tim , " he 's a-goin ' t ' cast them weights in molds . We 're a-goin ' t ' watch ' em made honest right here . We 're a-goin ' t ' pay Tim for the work outen the treasury  --  you see he gets paid , Swith  --  then we 're a-goin ' to send weights enough for every cotton scales there is . ' N then we 're a-goin ' to have our own members a-standin ' guard at every gin . Iffen the scales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay . Get yore shotguns oiled ' n ready ' cause this is war for a just ' n righteous cause . " Stunned at all this plan implied , his people stared and shifted uneasily , then , as his spell lessened , they looked at each other questioningly . Up through Verity 's breast a cold sharpness formed like a pointed icicle stopping her windpipe . Trying to protest she could make no sound come from her . Looking fran-c ically at the faces of his hearers , her eyes locked with Tim's133and read in them a troubled question . From her eyes , he seemed to form that question into words . " Guns , you said , Hank ? " he asked . Sophy rose and waved a clenched fist . " Yes , guns , he said , Tim . ' N I say so too ! Iffen Hank says guns , he means guns ! " " That 's right . That 's shore right ! " The conviction of rightness in flank 's voice stirred the people like a call to colors . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War for the freedom of men . We got a right to what 's ourn . For generations people like to us has been lost like to the captives in a strange land . Which same we read about in the psalms a ' I ) avid . But for generations peoplelike to us  --  the poor white trash they call us  --  has just let ourselves stay captives when we should ought a been fightin ' t ' get back t ' Zion . The psalm says the captives complained and cried , How shall we sing in a strange land ? ' " He tore at his collar till it burst open , smacked one palm into the other , jumped up and down , and cursed . " Why , god-damit ! I say t ' you that we should ought a fight first for our rights ' n sing afterwards ! I feel I got a mission , friends . A mission ! An ' that 's to do all I can in a human way  --  all the time a-askin ' the Lord 's help ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you free ? Are you ? No ! But , b ' God'lmighty , iffen y ' do yore duty now that you got a somebody  --  ' n that 's me  --  t ' lead you-all , ' n stand the burden a ' all that leadership lncans  --  iffen y ' do yore duty , iffen you yoreselvesflora never know that freedom , h ' God'lmighty , yore childern 'll know it ! " " We 're with y ' , Hank , iffen the Lord 'll let us ! " It was Swith 's voice , piping and quavery with excitement . " Iffen the sonsabitches ai n't got crooked scales they ca n't object , " said Harry Disbro almost reasonably . Verity began to breathe again . Of course ! If they are n't crooked they ca n't object and if they are they should be stopped . " All right . All right . " Hank waved his hands quieting the crowd . " Now the local mill here is run by Mr. Roy L. Saucier ' n y ' all know he come into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never overlook he 's the fourth in his line ! " His voice scorched the Castleberry lineage . " Now when I was at the Capitol I looked up some things ' n I found out that lotsa states has a department that 's called the Department a ' Weights ' n Measures , ' n their bizness is t ' check all scales ' n such . Now this here state ai n't got one . Now lissen close  --  five years ago the Governor wanted to have such a outfit . ' N who bucked him ? Why , Castleberry 's crowd ' n them Newtons ' n others liken to ' em in other parts a ' the state . We 'll purely fix ' em all in time . Ai n't that enough ? Ai n't it , friends ? " Yes , it was enough . It was a great plenty . These men and women were no longer just grubworms with no expectations beyond making their little furrows in the ground . They were human beings with a purpose and a cause . As Hank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gins in the five parishes where they had members , and began to lay specific plans for the manning , Verity rose and went out into the sunshine . Jenny , bone thin , crumpled , and soiled , ran toward the hitchingposts after an escaped twin . As she caught him up and turned , holding him tight to her scrawny breast , she looked tenderlyon the red , protesting little face and said softly : " Y ' got reason fer squallin ' . But someday y 'll have things better , y ' will . " Yes , Verity thought , someday our babies will have things better . ' The following months of Hank 's absence were filled with whispers concerning the activities of the Hank Martin Organization , with whispers about Mr. Roy L. Saucier 's unease . Verity could not feel a deep interest in it all . A peculiar , perhaps a divine immunity surrounded her . When she walked in the village , talked with the villagers , or even with Jules , she felt apart from all their interests . She walked with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except sudden hunger and occasionally a faint , watery nausea . These brought135an ever-surprising realization that childbearing was , after all , a physical process . Sometimes she laughed at herself for feeling so superior because of pregnancy . But mostly she did just what must be done because her brain still recognized the daily tasks , the daily friends ; but all the rest of her absorbed the sun and the rains and waited for the first little shooting kick of life . She wanted to keep this knowledge front Selah , but Selah 's eyes searched hers and the rich voice seemed always to be singinglullabies these days . One bright uiorniiig when all living things shone and dripped with left-over rain drops front a dawn-time shower , Verity walked along the roadside absorbing the splendor . Her starched blue gingham hung limp and clinging , for she chose to walk through the tall weeds of late summer . She heard the rhythm of horses ' hoofs making muffled beats in the mud , like dashers clntning butter . She knew it was Jules and turning , stood with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun , still low against its earth bed in the east . Looking into the sun eye to eye , she felt energetic and tall . It is something to feel as tall as the sun , even if the sun is sitting down at breakfast . Jules reined his horse to a walk , and the up-thrown mud no longer struck the animal 's belly nor Jules 's boots and trousers . The two spotted dogs ran to Verity . " Down ! Down ! " Jules commanded , and the clogs stood before her , restricting their greeting to the joyous wriggling of everythingback of forelegs . " I knew you 'd be out . Such a wonderful morning ! If we had n't met I 'd have come to your house . " " Why ? " she asked . " I have just returned from Loder City . Robert  --  Robert Castleberry  --  tells me there are rumors everywhere that the white trash  --  forgive me , Verity  --  are planning to do something drastic . Picking time begins in only a few weeks . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Hank MartinOrganization . " He looked down on her earnestly . " This morning Moses assured me that it is known everywhere . Can this possibly be true ? " 136She hesitated only a second . " I see no reason why you should not know . Yes , it is true . There is some such plan . " " But , " Jules almost gasped , " surely Hank can be made to see that it simply will not do ! " " Why not , Jules ? " " It 's fantastic ! It is the most gigantic insult ! The Castleberrys and the Newtons would not be parties to thievery . And what is more , they will not endure the insult of being told they are suspected of thievery . They are gentlemen . You are from the North , Verity , my dear . " He dismounted and stood beside her . " You do not understand exactly . But if Hank 's men come with guns and some are killed , " he shrugged , " the Castleberrys and the Newtons could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And if one of the Castleberrys or the Newtons is killed ? " She asked it coolly , seeming only to want information . " The killer would hang , of course . " " But suppose Hank is right  --  that they are thieves  --  that they are Black Skimmers ? " " Black Skimmers ! " Disgust was in his voice . " Hank 's dramatics ! He is  --  " " Please , Jules  --  " The one-sided grin played over his face . " Believe me , I mean this well . For a moment  --  that evening at the house  --  Hank even had me thinking in terms of Black Skimmers . " " I know , " she said slowly . " But just suppose that Hank is right ? " " Hank can not possibly be right . I have known these men and their families all my life . All my cotton , ever since I first went away from home , has been handled by Robert . " He laughed . " Hank would point out that I have grown poorer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost pleadingly , " Verity , you must realize what this means . You must be sure Hank realizes . He dare not accuse such men lightly . " " Judging from the preparations I would n't say he is accus-137ing them lightly , Jules . " Then , like a rocket , some of the new fierceness flared . The fierceness which she always felt dated back to her meeting with the Little Flamingo . " Dead moss ! " she cried . " Hank was right  --  you 're literally covered with dead moss ! Ca n't anyone in your rich upper class be wrong ! " He was startled . " I 'm not championing one class against an- other class . I know those men well . And from all I hear , Hank 's plans have all the earmarks of gangsterism . Sounds like some- thing that bootlegger , Capone , up North , would do . Or that ghastly Guy Polli in Crescent City . " " Do you mean to stand there and tell me that your friends , the Castleberrys and the Newtons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here ? " She could e lure no more , and turning she ran from him . Anger beat in upon her . She had been content for months . Content like the earth to wait another season , to wait for her baby , to do nothing but wait and nurture life ; and now all her content was shattered . Worry and unease harried her for the next weeks , making her retch with nausea . " Y'all shoulda done dat pukin ' de firs ' mont 's , " said Selah . " You have to know everything , do n't you ? " " Yas'ni . " Selah was undisturbed by her sarcasm . " Y'all cai n't keep no so carts him nu ' . " She laughed . " Lawsy , Miz Ver'ty , I bet I knowed it near ' bout soouer'n y'all did . Dere 's a look comes in de eye . Yas 'm , dcre is . A kinda wide an ' watery look , it is . Lawsy , eva'body in de town suspicion it . W'en I in Mistuh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vittles , Miz Peck she whispuh is you dat-a-way ? ' N I says I reckon so . " " Get out of here , Selah . Go to your own shack . " Tears streamed down Verity 's face . " Oh , damn it ! Oh , damn it ! " The door had opened and Hank stared at them . " What th ' hell ! Sweetface , how come I find you liken this ? " Glaring at Selah , he demanded , " You been abusin ' her ? What for 's she a-bawlin ' ? " 138 " Don ' pay her no mind , Mistuh Hank , " Selah grinned . " She goin ' to have us a baby . " " A baby ? " Hank seemed not to understand at first , then , " God'lmighty , " he said softly , " God'lmighty ! Is that a fact , Sweetface ? " Verity nodded dumbly . Hank stared at her , puzzling . " You ai n't got no common attitude ' bout this , have y ' ? You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't want it ? " She could n't speak , just shook her head denying . " Lawsy , no , Mistuh Hank . She mad at me ' cause I knowed . Mad ' cause near ' bout eva'body know it . An ' her a-tryin ' fo ' to keep it securt so 's you be firstes t ' know . " Selah laughed comfortably . " Ai n't God good t ' me ! " said Hank reverently . Then , turning on Selah , he bellowed , " Well , get t ' hell outa here , y ' black skinfula ' sin . Ai n't y ' got sense enough at a time liken this t ' get out ? Go on , now , hurry upl Pick up them size twelves a ' yours ' n set one in front a ' the other double time . " Selah hurried toward the door , laughing . " God'lmighty , here I am gon na have me a babyl Here I come home ' n find white women ' n black women a-bawlin ' ' cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God-'lmighty , I been gon na have a baby for months ' n I never even knowed it ! Ai n't that a helluva note ! " " I thought it was , " said Verity , new tears rolling . " Here , here , " said Hank softly , " ai n't I allus told youdon'tnever salten yore eyes for what 's done ' n over ? " " It 's not done and over , " she sniffled . " It shore is . Ca n't be undone . ' N I 'm purely thankful , Lord . That young'un 's gon na have a pappy to be proud of . That 's a promise , Sweetface . " He kissed her . " Me , gon na have a baby ! What d' you know ! " A few days later strange men whom Verity had never seen came to her door . Most of them were marked with the same : Iwkwardness , the same odd eagerness , an eagerness that lay 1 ike transparent tinsel over dull hopelessness . They stood on139her little porch in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and heavy boots , their shining guns the only well-earedforthing about them . When Hank was home they came in and listened carefully to directions , and one from each group was picked for leader of his crowd . Some of them came from water huts and grew no cotton . They came to help the cotton men because they were one in Hank 's big dream . With maps spread out on the kitchen table , and with Verity and Selah cooking and serving , Hank planned his campaign . The day Spurge McMcnimee and his forty-two followers arrived was a great day . Hank , answering the knock , bellowed at Spurge , " God'lmighty , Spurge ! I knowed y 'd come ! I 'm gon na have a baby ! Ai n't that wonderful ? I 'm purely a-prayin ' I do n't bust myself under the strain . " The two men greeted each other with such enthusiasm , such great pleasure , that all present caught the feel that here were brothers . Spurge was as fine a figure in trouser-cut blue jeans and white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . About his waist gleamed the fine , well-rubbed leather of wide belt and two holsters , deep-cut , so that revolvers could be pulled fast and quick with no snagging catch on the cylinders . And in his hands a long and lovely rifle glinted bluely like his eyes . " I reckon y 'll survive that strain , Hank , " he said . Taking Verity 's hand he bowed with his great natural courtesy . " It pleasures me mightily t ' be a-seein ' of y ' again , ma'am . ' N the news a ' yore expectin 'll pleasure near ' bout everybody . " " Thank you , Spurge , " she said and thought how swiftly she had adjusted to having this news shouted at top-lung strength . " How are Lula May and all the children ? " " They 're all peart , " he said and looked away from her . " ' N my Little Flamingo ? " asked Hank , his voice soft with concern . Pain passed over Spurge 's face . He answered stonily . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " Hank studied him a second . " Hell , ai n't it , the way fightin ' 140goes on in a man liken love , an ' the things he has got ta do whilst answerin ' some insistence in him on duty ' r justice ? " " Yeah , " said Spurge stoically . " She 's yore first-borned , Spurge . I got tenderness in me for first-borns right now . I hope mine 'll have the guts Sunny Lou 's got . " Putting an arm around Spurge 's shoulders , he added , " Hope you 'll be a-readin ' that there letter first chancet y ' get . " God forbid , thought Verity , that my first-born should have the same type of guts . The Little Flamingo ! Every time Verity thought of her she felt a memory fear , a memory pain of that ' gator pole . And yet there was in her a sympathy for the child ; she was only a fierce wild thing like a baby bear . The time for cash money and backaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , men , women , and children , were reporting to the great plantations . But throughout five parishes on share-crop farms and on the owned-and-mortgaged farms , there was a noticeable lack of adult men . The picking there was left for the time being to the women and the young'uns . A good percentage of the men were in Cypress Bend , sleeping nights on Hank 's little porch , in his barn , in Tim Peck 's smithy shop , on the Disbro porch , in barns with mules , and most anywhere they could drop . Each night Hank walked out among the men , like a general worrying about morale , and each night he returned to report to Verity . " It 's wonderful ! By God'lmighty , it 's purely wonderful . They ai n't a-goin ' t ' be licked . They got a hope for the first time in generations ! " Selah 's beau , Tape , came to Hank one day and stood before him bashfully , first on one foot and then on the other , like a thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please . " His voice went into such a deep croak that it broke off in a confused gurgle . " Who 're you ? " " He Tape , Mistuh Hank , " Selah beamed . " He kind uv settin ' t ' me , Tape is. " 141 " Is that so ! " Hank exclaimed amiably in the midst of all his work and plans . Grinning at Tape he said , " One thing you allus wanta remember , Tape  --  do n't never court her too earnest . You 're li'ble to wake up hitched . She 's a good cook but I sometimesthink she 's schemin ' . " Selah laughed , but Tape shifted feet , twisted his old hat , and hawked his throat clear of frogs . " I ai n't come fo ' funnin ' , Mistnli flank . " " No ? " Hank asked . For what , then ? " " I'se come fo ' askin ' y'all  --  I owns in ' own lan '  --  two acre . I'se got me a cotton patch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  well , does usn  --  de culla 'd folks git hones ' price , too ? " " You 're clang tootin ' they do , Tape . Honest price for all men , white ' r black . " Hank 's voice rang with honest assurance . A wide toothy grin shone from the black face . " Usn thanks y'all , suh , " he said . " Yessuh , shu ' do . Cai n't usn he'p ? " Hank jumped up as if electrified . " God'lmighty ! You niggers got ta stay outa this . Iffen you niggers takes a part , I 'm ruint . " Turning to Swith and four other men he called them by names and howled , " You know where all the gins are . Get a-goin ' ! For Christ 's sake , see to it not ary nigger raises a hand . Iffen there 's fightin ' the niggers is to back theiiselves ' n their cotton down the road . They ai n't never t ' see notliin ' , nor know nothin ' . Get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a-goin ' ! " I-Ic clashed out of the house with them and hurried them on their ways . When he returned he clapped Selah on the back and grinned , " You 're a great big life-size good-luck charm ! Iffen it was n't for you a-havin ' so much lure for the men so 's they come a-settin ' t ' y ' , I might never ' a thought what a defeat yore race might ' a brung me ! " From Tape to Selah a message flashed which said this was like all else , there was no equality for them . Hank 's face sobered . " Y ' got me all wrong . Y ' know well 's I do that yore people'd142be lynched . Iffen y ' got the brains God give a shrimp , y ' know too  --  ' n y ' know it well  --  that the rich , the kind as has had yore kind in slavery , thinks less a ' my kind than they do a ' yoren . Yes , in lotsa ways they do . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threat . " Pacing back and forth , waving his hands , he delivered what seemed to Verity to be one of the most enlightening speeches he ever made . For her it made clear some of the odd subtleties . " I want no enemies amongst yore people . You should ought a have a country a ' yore own . You 're a-feelin ' sorry for yoreselves'cause you was slaves . White men fought one war to free yore people , ' n you was only slaves a few hundred years . But folks like to me ' n my kind has been slaves since the world begun . " Shaking his fist at the heavens and at Selah and Tape , he orated roundly , " ' N you take it from me , there ai n't no more freedom for yore people tillst my kind a ' people is freed  --  ' n that 's the God 's truth ! We got ta get freed by some changes as is all linked up withen money ' n law . " The white men present sat tense and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , completely caught in a spell . Selah swiped the tears from her eyes with the back of her hand , pulled a large blue kerchief from her apron pocket , and blew her nose long and loud . Tape jumped at the sound . " Gawd , Selah ! " he said . " Nigh ' bout made me think yo ' nose de trumpet uv Gabri'l . " Some of the white men laughed . But not black Tape . " Fo ' Gawd , " he said earnestly , " you done make me feel better den I'se felt since I pulled on m ' mammy 's black breas ' . I wants ter go tell de deacons . Selah , she plumb right , Mistuh Hank . You got a chariot uv fiah . " As in a dream he turned and opened the door , chanting emotionally , " Elijah got a chariot uv fiah ; Mistuh Hank got a chariot uv fiah ; all us chilluns got a chariot  --  " But as Tape reached the door he came out of his dream , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their feet , snapped their guns into position to be swung quickly to shoulders . Turning as if on a fast-spinning swivel , Tape cried , " De law's143aa-comin ' ! De law 's a-comin ' ! " and he came back in , slamming the door . In the yard Hank 's men stood watchful and silent , parting to let the enemy pass . " Leastways thirty deputies , " said IIank softly as he looked through the window . " ' N God'Imighty ! The Black Skimmer ! The Black Skimmer , men ! Castleberry hisself , ' n Saucier , too ! Why , they must be crookeder'n a body dare believe ! " Turning to his men , he whispered hoarsely , " Such opposition 's purely a compliment , men ! A confession , too , was y ' t ' ask me . ' N them deputies is every one strangers . IIe 's brung ' cm from Loder City ! " A revolver handle pounded thunderously on the door . The knob turned . The door was kicked open . Strangers , belted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opening , glaring at Hank 's men . " Where 's Hank Martin ? " an officer demanded . Jumping forward , Hank yelled with the fierce bellow of an animal attacking , " I 'm Hank Martin ! ' N what the hell d'y mean walkin ' into my house ? This ai n't no public place ! That there ai n't no public door ! What the hell d'y mean ? " " Got a warrant for you . " The deputy took a folded paper from his pocket . " What 's the charge ? " IIank demanded as a murmur ran through the crowd . " Inciting a crowd with intent to disturb the peace . " " Incitin ' a crowd with intent to disturb the peace ! " Hank bellowed . " A crowd ? Just one crowd ? Why , I got leastways fifty crowds in five parishes ! Intent to disturb the peace , " he sneered . " Why , that 's purely a insult t ' my capacities ! Does my men ' n their guns look like we 're a-fixin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look like war ? " His head went up and back in a great laugh . His men echoed him faintly in relief . The deputies were being motioned aside , and Robert Castleberryentered Hank Martin 's house . Long and taut like a drawn144sword he stood , his green eyes gleaming like the jade lie loved . " Serve that paper , " he commanded the officer . Hank held out his hand for the paper and the officer laid it in his palm . Slowly , and with great ostentation , Hank took it and read it . After a few seconds he looked up . As he did so , all Verity 's fears for him took wings and flew away , for a teasing mischievousness glinted in Hank 's eyes . " Well , well , " he said elaborately . " Well , well . A disturb-thepeacewarrant . Ai n't I heard yore lawyer is a real blue-blood , Castleberry ? " The green glare did not waver , nor did Mr. Castleberry lower himself to answer . " Well , his blood 's too blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ None whatsomever . " Slapping the refolded paper into the deputy 's hand , Hank sneered , " That was issued in Loder City . Ai n't no such warrant good unlessen it 's issued in the parish it 's served in . " The deputies looked confused . The one with the paper said , " I supposed it was issued here . I did n't look at it  --  " " Shut up ! " Castleberry snapped . Then to Hank , " You are mistaken . You know nothing of law . " " I know a damsite more'n you ' n yore blue-blood lawyer put together . I just proved that . Now you back outa my house , you Black Skimmer . Go on , get a-backin ' there . " Castleberry stood still and drawn . Hank 's men lifted their guns . The deputies crowding the doorway lifted their revolvers . " None a ' that , men , " said Hank . " We do n't wanta disturb the peace . Not ' less we 're forced t ' stoop to such . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Black Skimmer can take into his innards in a backward flight . " " From out Castleberry 's green eyes , from out his whitening . face , there shot the purest hate . There was no hint of defeat ; no hint of chagrin . He turned . Taut and straight , like good steel walking , he passed between the deputies , seeming above and beyond such ugly knowledge as the need for drawn firearms , and on , superb , magnificent , through the little yard. 145From mouth to mouth ran the whisper , " Black Skimmer , " " Black Skimmer . " Hank 's men followed him out the door , guns up , the deputies backed in two lines alongside the forwardfacingCastleberry . In Roy L. Saucier fear for his boss geysered up like the old faithful he was , as he screamed , " Run , Mr. Castleberry , run ! " And in a panic Saucier pushed through Hank 's men , going toward his employer . It struck Verity as funny : a mouse instructing a lance . She understood the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grin high above his head and let go a shot toward the bayou . But another shot sounded just a split beat later , and then another . Everything happened so fast , yet she saw it all , heard it all . She heard Roy L. Saucier 's scream of pain as the first shot that was fired by a deputy got him . She knew the deputy was confused , had thought Saucier one of flank 's men . She heard the deputy utter one small moan as the bullet from Harry Disbro 's gun went through his heart . The deputy lay dead at the foot of the steps , right at her very feet , his own gun still smoking from the shot that killed Saucier . She was suddenly racked with pain and fear . Her hands flew protectinglyto her stomach . She looked wildly about as Hank bellowedto the men . " Stop ! Stop ! Quiet ! I got somethin ' t ' say ! " As the crowd quieted , flank said , loud and scathingly , " Every person here seen that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tliinkin ' he was one a ' us . " He looked over the crowd , giving Harry and every one of his followers confidence . " You done right , Harry . Nothin ' else you could do  --  a nervous fool shootin ' into our men , a-threatenin ' the life a ' any one a ' us . " Castleberry fastened his cold green stare on Harry Disbro . " You will hang for this ! " The hate-filled , incisive words acted as a bracer on Hank . " Never ! " said Hank in a hoarse , fervent whisper . " Never ! " Verity saw him breathe deep , thin his belly , and knew he was pushing out fear . " Worse'n the killin ' of yore nervous , pulin ' 146men is the insult you give us a-comin ' here withen a no ' - count paper . " He shook his fist at the taut Castleberry . " You 'll never condemn Harry . The day 's past when you can get us down yore gullet , ' cause we 're one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army , Hank commanded , " On to the gin , men ! " He took I larry 's arm , " You too , Harry . " Then , with great show of disdain , he said to Castleberry , " 13y the time you manage to figger out the right paper as will 1ntt Harry in jail a spell , you 'll be proved t ' be a thief . ' N carry yore dead outa my yard . . . Onward , men ! " Sinking to the gallery steps , Verity shut her eyes against the milling men , shut her ears to sounds , and put every ounce of herself into the one job of clinging to consciousness in the midst of pain , into waiting for strength to come to her again . For with the killing of two men , Hank 's child gave its first kick of life. 1477Hank Martin had the beginnings of a kingdom by the iinic his first child was born  --  a kingdom of dreams for the lowly and poor . And when his peddler 's whistle shrilled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Hank 's people  --  brought tributes of wild geese and ducks , of fox and deer , of chickens and diapers and gingham . They came barefoot through the gum-tar mud . .. . SELaa and Tape lifted her and carried her to bed . She was a furnace of pain in body and mind , aware of just one sweet thing  --  Selah , her strong and ministering hands , her scolding , loving voice . " Dat man a-walkin ' out a-talkin ' big ' bout otha men 's young-'uns an ' his own near ' bout neva gittin ' t ' take a breaf . Um-mump ! Ain ' mens a somepin ' ! " Turning on Tape , she screamed , " Git out , you nothin ' - but- man ! Fotch me pail cold wata ' . Yo ' feetses ain ' nail ter de flo ' . " As she put cold cloths on Verity 's head , loosened her clothes , and propped her with pillows , she said over and over , " Whut fo ' y'all so upset , Miz Verity ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , jus " cause dere 's hullabaloo in yo ' ya 'd , is you ? You gwine halter git accustomated ter hullabaloo , you is . Umhum , you shu ' is . Plumb accustomated . Yas 'm , you is . Now , you ain ' gwine ter lose usn dat baby , is you ? " 148When Verity finally managed to shake her head in weak denial the tears came , slow at first like the first meltings of a northern spring and then in a flood as if the topmost peaks of her being had lost their white coverings in an avalanche . Selah sat quietly by the bed watching , wiping the tears and laying on cool cloths . After a long while she spoke . " Heah-heah , heah-heah , honey , dat ain ' gwine do no good . Naw , sir , no good a-tall . But Selah knows whut fo ' you is cryin ' . I shu ' does . Don ' be breakin ' yo ' heart , honey , ' cause yo ' man ain ' perfeck . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broad , forced humor , " Gawd done made man fu'st . Gawd done practiceon man .

" I knows whut you is feelin ' , y'all cai n't keep no securts fum me . You'se got a purty heart in you an ' you keeps it in you . Selah done seed de worry in yo ' face w'en Mistuh Hank show his heart to eva'body . " Laughing almost to herself , she added , " An ' lawsy , ain ' it a han'some sight w'en he gits it all granded up fo ' struttin ' ! Um-ummp ! W'en he take his heart out fo ' showin ' it plumb ready ter cakewalk ! " Selah chuckled and chuckled , unaware that her words hurt . Verity turned her face toward the wall . " You gittin ' sleepy , chile ? Dat shu ' good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Verity lay in a state of willing inactivity for three days . Slowly the inner forces mended as her strength returned . The baby still moved within her and this was good . Hank had not been home since he left with the men . The third morning Verity got up feeling new and almost strong again . " Mr. Hank has n't been home ? Nor sent any word ? " Verity asked as Selah put her breakfast on the table . " No 'm , he ain ' . Tape , he say mens still watching at de gin . Tape , he say mens gwine stan ' watch ter see eva load weighed.ugh de whole pickin ' season . He say it shu ' make a ' citin ' . iglit all de wagons down de road , all de mens wid guns . He say149eva'body know now Mistuh Hank right . Dem owners bin a-thievin ' eva'body . Tape , he say Moses say Mistuh Jules downrigh ' shocked wid de scandalization . " " Which scandal ? That Mr. Hank is right ? Or the shooting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " When she thought of Jules 's attitude , she went completely over to Hank 's side . " I reckons he jus ' mean de whole mess , Miz Verity . " All day she longed for news of Hank , longed to know what Jules was thinking . Sitting iu her low rocker sewing , her fingers idled time after time as she tried to analyze the depressing sense of a need for endurance and tolerance which knocked lightly at her consciousness . Was it simply because she was pregnant or was it some prescience she could not name , perhaps did not want to know ? Ilank came in the late afternoon , unshaven , disheveled , and furious , clutching a copy of the Loder City Courier . " Lookit this ! " he cried . Coming to Verity he handed her the paper and indicated the item . " I 'm a peddler a ' pins , pots , ' n potions , ' " he howled . " That 's what they call me ! ' N m ' name is said t ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t ' believe the cottonprices was unfair ! Not a word ' bout them blue-blooded bastards that 's been a-thievin ' for years ! Oh , no , not one word ' bout that ! Why , them fools on that there paper ai n't sure a ' nothin ' . Everything 's alleged  --  alleged  --  alleged ! B ' God'lmighty , I ai n't alleged them Black Skimmers is a thievin ' lot . I proved it . ' N still this here spineless sheet do n't print it ! " It was a little story of only four paragraphs , telling of " an uprising of the poor whites , " throughout five parishes , of the killings in Cypress Bend , one Harry Disbro 's arrest for shootingan officer , and of the deaths of two others who were Hank 's followers , Jedidiah Haskins and Hoke Marsh . The last paragraphsaid , " The uprising was allegedly led by a peddler who goes through the state peddling pins , pots , and potions . His name is said to be Hank Martin . " No mention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and raved , but Verity could n't answer . She had been haunted by the thought of Jenny and i rs . Saucier and that deputy 's family , and now , two more . " Those men  --  Haskins and Marsh  --  have they wives and families ? " " Shore , " he tossed off the answer almost absently . " Imagine that paper ! Ignorin ' the greatest thing that 's happened in these parts in years on end . ' N me  --  a peddler a ' pins , pots , ' n potions ! My name is said t ' be Hank Martin ! Why , m ' picture should ought a been on the front page . Someday I 'll cram them words down their choking throats ! " Hank dropped into a chair at the table and stared at the paper . She stared at him , not wanting to think public recognition meant more to him than the deaths and jailing of his followers . Crossing to the table she stood before him , her hands in protectivegesture across her stomach . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you almost frighten me . You 're sitting here mad and worried because a newspaper ignoresyou in a way . But you 're ignoring the suffering you 've ! nought on some individuals . Oh , yes , you 've been proved right and a good many people got more money for their cotton . ' f'loat 's fine as far as it goes . But Jenny 's our friend . And those two men , Haskins and Marsh , they were your friends too . " " Shore , Verity , but you don ' think for a instant the men did n't know they was li'ble to get popped off iffen there was trouble , do y ' ? " " Perhaps not , " she said , feeling oddly driven . " But , Hank , I 'm standing here pregnant with your child . If the tables were turned and you were sent to jail because you 'd followed an idea , a cause , that Harry started  --  well , I 'd hate Harry with all my heart . You are my husband ; you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But , Hank  --  even to me it 's not worth it . All this killing . Four men dead and one jailed . And you say this is only the beginning of your campaigns , as you call them . Four widows , and heaven only knows how many fatherless children . " Sobs broke from her and her hands flew up to cover her face. 151 " Hank , " she pleaded , " what 's the sense of my having your child when you seem to have so little regard for life ? " He drew back sharply as if she had struck him . " Me  --  little regard for life ? Are you crazy , woman ? My heart plumb aches for them as die . Ai n't nobody hates the notion a ' death more'n I do . I think God gathers in the fragments so 's nothin ' is wasted . But I love this here earth . I only just wanta make it more near to a paradise . " Drawing her to him lie said , " Sweetface , lookit  --  iffen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' quit with the first shots , this world 'd be purely a mess , seems as though . Take George Washington . Ile was a traitor . Why , shore he was . This country had English rule and Washington was a traitor to it . Lotsa men died follering Washington . And ai n't you glad they did ? " Handing her his huge blue handkerchief , he said gently , " Here , blow . Then lookit Lincoln . Widows wrote him , women pleaded , men stormed ' n threatened . But he prayed ' n fought . I got ta do the same ! " Tilting her face up and looking into her eyes , he said , " I ai n't never heard nothin ' that seemed acc'rate ' bout how the wives of them there men felt . Nor whether their women tried t ' argufy ' em outen their convictions . But , " he grinned , " I shore got a conviction that no man ca n't get great a-shushin ' his woman . I want you should anus speak out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There 's sometimes a kinda whetstone in yore scoldin " n yore argufying as hones me quick ' n sharp . " She dried her eyes and tried to smile . " ' N do n't you be a-worryin " bout Jedidiah Haskins ' n Hoke Marsh . Iffen ever I saw two men as is weary a ' livin " n producin ' young'uns , it 's them two . Too clang weary to dodge iffen they seen the bullets a-comin ' . ' N you know yoreself Harry 's a natural-borned sluggard . More'n likely he 'll plumb love settin ' in jail . " " Well , Harry may sit in jail and love you for bringing him ease , " she bridled . " But the women of this state are going to be influenced by what women like Jenny and Mrs. Marsh and152that other widow endure . These people are ignorant and superstitious . It seems to me they 're divided into two kinds  --  Swith 's kind , the fanatics who need a dream desperately , and the others who say simply iffen the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the last words like a voodoo chant . " It seems too bad your followersca n't take out insurance against the perils of Hank Martin . " She sank weakly into a chair . " Insurance , " he said slowly , " against the perils of Hank Martin . That 's just what they should ought a have , seems ' s though ! God'lmighty ! Would that pay me big dividends ! Be the first evidence folks 'd see a ' Hank Martin gettin ' the riches divided ! " He beamed on her and said softly , lovingly , " Hank 's little whetstone . Dang if you ai n't . " Chuckling , he took a pencil from his pocket , scribbled figures on the pine boards of the table . " Let 's see  --  Harry did n't never get more'n a hunderd ' n sixty cash money a year , ' n others a ' the organization c'n help tend his acres tillst we get him out . Allottin ' the same sums to the widow Haskins ' n the widow Marsh  --  ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a-earnin '  --  ' n soon be a-payin ' their dollarinto the organization . That 's four hunerd ' n eighty a year for the three a ' them  --  that 's thirteen dollars ' n forty cents just about , first a ' ev'ry month to each a ' them . " Looking up he grinned happily . " Hell , I c'n give ' em that outen my own pocket iffen I got ta . ' N then I 'll start a-collectin ' one dollar ' n ten cents a year . The ten centses to ' cumulate to benefit folks as need it . " A load lifted from Verity 's heart . Hank wanted to do what was right . He had only to see it . But the idea of paying out thirteen dollars every month to several widows amazed her . " Can we afford that , Hank ? " she asked . " Why , we do n't spend much more than that ourselves  --  cash money , as you say . " " Well , " he grinned , " that ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ai n't ' cause you ca n't have what you want . Just figger a little , Sweetface  --  all over the lakes ' n lagoons ' n rivers there 's settlementsa ' trappers ' n I 'm a-handlin ' their pelts . I do n't never153pay lodgin " n board . In thousands a ' homes Hank Martin is more welcome than sunshine . I do n't never feed m ' own horse , even , ' cept when he 's in m ' own barn . ' N all over the state , ' ceptin ' in a few parishes up t ' the north , " an in-seeing look clouded his eyes , " folks is a-payin ' to belong to m ' organization . I 'm a-goin ' to order all the funds transferred into one place , into one lump . All that money I can use someday when I see a fit cause . " " The parishes up north  --  1 ) o you mean near your home ? Your mother 's home ? " " Yeah . " Pain flashed across his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hack t ' see Maw . Someday  --  when I could walk in ' n say , Maw , I found the road t ' Zion . ' " He rose and looked out the window . " Well , I went north this last trip . Maw ' n old Crammaw is both dead . Hurt me some , it did , Sweetface . Still , I got confidence she 's somewheres better , ' n so it ai n't bad . It 's just  --  oh , I reckon I just sorta wanta to say it to her personal . " How great a thing it is to be a mother , Verity thought . But how sacrificial . Looking at Hank , thinking of him as he always appeared  --  so self-sufficient , so boisterously sure , it was hard to realize he could feel the deep childish need to return to a mother and prove he had done well . IIank sighed . " I did n't go to my home , Verity . Did n't have no heart to see Paw ' n my brothers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do somethin ' for ' em , I reckon . Feller ca n't just pay no mind t ' his kin after he gets t ' be a somebody . I got no good feelin 's for ' em , though . Fact is , they gim me the jaundice . " As he turned to face Verity , the hurt was so plain that all the mother in her wanted to help him and protect him . But she said nothing . She waited for Hank to clear his own mind of shadows . " Pity I did n't think t ' send Maw some money oncet in a while . I should plumb ought a have a banel stave laid crost my rump . " He grinned ruefully . " It 's purely hell the things a154man should ought a do , ' n do n't never think ' bout tillst it 's too late . " Selah knocked , and Verity was glad to have her come in grumbling . " Law , knockin ' at de do ' when I comes inter de onliest kitchen I'se @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cook on , " Selah mumbled . " Knockin ' at de do ' lak I don ' live heah . " " Well , you do n't live here , " said Hank . " You live yonder t' other side a ' them tomatoes you planted . You think I 'm a-goin ' t ' have a big dark wench a-walkin ' in on me any time she 's a ' mind ? Cheer up , Selah , I plumb guarantee y ' when I get us a house big as Bolduc 's , there wo n't be no doors you got ta knock on ' ceptin ' mebbe a few upstairs . " " Heh , heh , " sighed Selah largely , " ai n't he one fo ' funnin ' , Miz Verity ! Usn wid a house lak dat ! Oh , dat mind 's me . Law , I nigh ' bout fergit ! Mistuh Jules , he pass by w'en I'se in de fiel ' a-choppin ' wid de hoe . He call ter me an ' he say tell y'all he stoppin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Here ! " Hank beamed . " I been a-worryin ' how is Jules a-takin ' it ' bout Castleberry . Been honin ' t ' go t ' his house but reckoned it 's plumb his turn for showin ' his cards . It 's suppertime . We ai n't never returned Jules 's invites . What we got for supper ? " " Usn got peppa ' hash wif corn , an ' mustard greens , an ' cowpeas . An ' I'se fixin ' de fines ' biscuits Mistuh Jules eva ' et . Usn got de fines ' clabba ' fer t ' make dem biscuits eva ' you see . Umum , dat shu ' a fine cow usn got now . Fines ' milk eva ' I see . Sours up int ' de bestes ' clabba ' . Um-um ! Even de whey betta ' dan some cows ' cream . " Thinking of Jules at her table flustered Verity and she hastened to her linen shelf . Nice tablecloths were things she cherished . Whenever she laid one she felt a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the years of oilclothin the orphanage . She chose a soft yellow cloth and after spreading it she went into the yard with her kitchen shears . As she cut lavender and purple asters she wondered about Jules. 155 He had been so sure Castleberry could not be dishonest . Jules was a puzzle . Such a cynic , in a way , thinking of people in classes . How , then , would he react to these recent events ? " Hank , " she asked as she entered the house , " what makes you think Jules will stay for supper ? He was very angry about your accusations , you know . " " Yeah , I know , " Hank replied . " Men he holds I should n't ought a done it just ' cause they was blue-bloods , I 'm gon na be plumb disappointed iii Jules . But no matter what he says , I got ta have Jules 's friendsliil ) up to a point , I have . I ca n't tend m ' business , earn a livin ' , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schoolin ' for law . ' N law 1 got ta have . ' N Jules I got ta have for a kinda private teacher liken you been up to now . " " Mistnli Jules , lie look plumb peaked dis eve'nin ' , " said Selah . " What time did he pass ? " " Long ' bout tree ' clock , I reckon . " " I never will get accustomed to evening beginning in the afternoon , " commented Verity . " I 've worried about Jules . He 's been a good friend . " " IIe 's a-comin ' now , " said Hank from the doorway . " He shore rides somethin ' handsome , do n't he ? " Watching him coming toward them through the day 's last paleness , Verity felt as she had that night months ago , felt an urge to call to a friend . She wanted to call , " Jules , be'my friend ! Be hunk 's friend ! Cypress Bend would be unbearable without you . " She waited , feeling he must not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But she hoped . Had he not called today ? Was he not coming back ? He need n't have come . As he dismounted , Hank started forward to greet him , but Verity stood waiting in the door . " Ev'nin ' , Jules , " Hank called . " Good evening , Hank , " said Jules . He tied his horse to the gatepost , then came forward , hand extended . His gesture toward Hank thrilled Verity and she steepled her fingers in the childish gesture of prayer and happiness . " You were right and I was wrong , " said Jules clearly . " It 's 156 been a shock to me , Hank . I can not imagine Robert stooping to such a thing . Nor the Newtons , either . But there 's no denyingit now . " He hesitated but seemed to have more to say . Sensing this , Hank prompted , " ' N so . . . ? " " I do not see eye to eye with you in your method of exposingthis fact , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do thank you for opening my eyes . There are things about it to regret . Men have died and enemies have been made . " " Enemies , huh ? Yores ' r mine ? " " I was thinking of mine . For the first time in generations Cypress Manor is not open to the Castleberrys . " " Well , roarin ' thunderbolts , Jules , I never suspicioned you was one a ' them there sentimentalist fellers as cries to have back a yesterday ! " Coming down the steps of her tiny porch Verity held out her hand to Jules , saying , " It 's not that , Hank . Jules cries for the fine trust of the yesterdays . " " Thank you , Verity , my dear , " said Jules and kissed her hand . " Fine trust ! " Hank exploded . " I ai n't seen no evidence a nothin ' like that in the hist'ry I been a-readin ' . Hell , Jules , them forebears you 're a-talkin " bout bought ' n sold humans . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ niggers had a right t ' be left in their own lands . ' N them forebears you 're a-talkin " bout did n't do nothin " bout dividin ' the riches . They left that foi you t ' write a cynical paper ' bout , ' n for me to do somethin ' lout . " Jules seemed puzzled . Hank roared with laughter . " That 's right , Jules . You ' member that first night we et al yore house ? Minute I saw Castleberry , I knowed he was 1 ; lack Skimmer ' n I tolt you some a ' what I was a-thinkin " r I asked y ' for that there paper y ' wrote . You gim me it , ' n I beer a-tliinkin ' ever since . " He thumped Jules 's chest . " There , y si e , " he crowed , " you 're a partner in m ' crime whether y knowed it ' r not . " " Your reasoning is unique . " Jules shook his head slowly . 157 " Goin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t ' first causes , " said Hank . " We was hopin ' you 'd stay ' n eat supperwith us . " " It will give me much pleasure , " said Jules . " You been a-ridin ' , so ' spect you 'll wanta wash . You got ta wash out back . This is one a ' them horrible share-crop places owned by a feller named Jules Bolduc , y ' know . " " Selah will bring you warm water and towels , " said Verity . As Jules reentered through the back door he stood still a second looking at the room . " Make yoreself t ' lame , " said I lank ; " Ill go tend yore horse . " You have made this place charming , Verity . I would not have thought it possible . lie looked about with frank interest . As he stood near the back door , the coal-oil reflector lamp on a high shelf caught him full in its halo , giving his smile a tenderness Verity had never seen before . Standing between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stiffly starched curtains of green checkered gingham , his eyes seemed to encompass everything and yet to be saying something special to her . Selah looked up from the oven before which she knelt , having peered in at her biscuits , and grinned broadly at him . " You ai n't a-lookin ' so peaked lak you did w'en you heah earlier dis ev'nin ' , Mistuh Jules , " she said . " An ' w'en you eats dose biscuits you ai n't goin ' t ' look peaked a-tall . " " I am sure of that , Selah , " he said sincerely . " Green floors  --  I have seen them in only one other house . A maharajah 's palace . It is very pleasant . " " It was Hank 's idea , " said Verity . " Was it ? " Walking toward the shelves of books , he looked at the titles which varied from the fifth-grade reader to biographiesof Lincoln and Saint-Simon . " I have underestimated Hank . " His voice was very low and earnest . " Quite as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew it to be an apology for the times he had given her unhappiness by making her defend Hank . A need rose in 158her to sit somewhere alone with this man and discuss her husband , a need to tell him how she felt about those men who were dead because they believed in Hank . She wanted to tell him that her father 's people had been Quakers , wanted to tell him about her mother and her mother 's belief in American opportunity . She wanted to tell him about Hank 's childhood and how he felt about his mother . She wanted to tell him about the Little Flamingo , and the new thrusts of fierceness she felt flame within her . Oh , yes , and about the Ribidoux family and the way Hank helped them and many others . She wanted to see him take all these pictures and place them in some different way  --  the way he saw them , and let her look at them then . Perhapsthe struggle of these many thoughts showed upon her face , for he seemed so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little porch and into the room , the screen door slamming behind him . " Say , Jules , you seen the Loder City papers ? " Jules nodded . " Well , what the hell you make a ' that ? I prove them Black Skimmer 's guilty ' n not a word ' bout them . But the leader a ' the white-trash uprisin ' is alleged ' t ' be me . " " Suppah 's ready , " announced Selah . They sat down . Hank bowed his head and rattled off grace . " Lord bless this food ' n Yore earth ' as yields it t ' us , ' n thanks t ' You , Lord , for the suns ' n rains that guarantees us aplentymore . Amen . " Without stopping an instant he raised his head and said , " Why , them blue-blooded , yellow-bellied , kowtowin ' dim-wits as print that there paper ai n't got sense enough t ' know the biggest thing that 's happened in these here parts in years has been a-goin ' on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' print the truth when it 's agin the likes a ' Castleberry ? " " It could be either , " replied Jules , smiling . " But when you are running for governor and really need to have the voters know about you , why , then , you will probably get a publicity manager . " " What 's that ? "
