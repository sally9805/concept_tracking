 | Wanted : A Plan for Defense Condensed from Harper 's Magazine Hanson W. Baldwin CONGRESS and the public stirred by the implication ! of a German victory , havf become acutely conscious of our defense problem . In the past ter months they have seen the Allies ; come tumbling out of a world of dreams and military mistakes , They have realized the cold truth that Germany prepared for this ' , war ; France prepared for the last war ; Britain prepared for no war ; and that today we stand somewhere between France and Britain , too many of our preparations having been for no war of reality . Not that our defense funds in the past seven years have been " poured down a rathole , " whatever may be said in this campaign season . Army , Navy and air forces have been considerably strengthened . But neither the results achieved nor the programs planned meet our present defense needs . Red tape and inefficiency have caused delay and waste . At least 40 of 107 vessels commissioned in those seven years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had t0 buy from Germany the basic design for our antitank gun , still unavailable in quantity . We have but recently begun the manufacture of more powerful antiaircraft guns , such as have been in service in Europe for years ; we still have no aircraft cannon . Jealousy between infantry and cavalry hampered the development of mechanized forces and led to such absurd extremes that the cavalry had to call its tanks " combat cars , " leaving the word " tank " to the infantry . Congress has appropriated substantial sums for defense without manifesting intelligent interest in the all-important task of transmuting dollars into guns . Now the nation has swung to the other extreme . The danger now is not indifference , but hysteria . Wall  | Street fears a German invasion of the United States this year , and the President talks about 50,000 planes ? more than all the combat air forces of all the belligerents put together . Organizations called Sixth Columns , little more than thinlyveiled vigilantes , are sprouting . The times call for sane judgment and the floodlight of fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their success to complete coordination of ground and air . Our own defense forces suffer from lack of such coordinated effort . We have no unity of command , no planning commission , no war college where strategic planning by all arms is possible . The influence of air power upon sea power is evident ; in narrow waters , opera-. tions of fleets will be hampered . But , all in all , the struggle at sea has shown that for our purposes the fighting ship is more important than ever , since we are separated from potential enemies by 3000 to 7000 miles of ocean that can be dominated by ships alone . IF WE ARE to have a defense program that is more than the blind appropriation of dollars we must first know what we are prepared to defend , and against whom we are to defend it . There is virtual unanimity of opinion on hemisphere defense . There is no need to defend every bit of the Western Hemisphere ? all that is required is sufficient control of strategic points to enable our planes ships to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bridgeheads . " This means supervision ove area from Alaska to and be Hawaii , thence eastward to Galapagos ; thence around part of South America that eludes the " bulge " of Brazil , northward to Greenland on a h running roughly through the Brazilian island of St. Paul in ml Atlantic and the Azores . ' 1'h seems like a large order  --  b relatively few bases , properly sit ated , with the proper forces operating from them or ready to be s to them , can insure control of t hemisphere . Air , naval and military base within the United States and Alaska and Hawaii are being p vided , though red tape still need to be cut . Near the Canal Zone agreements similar to the one with Nicaragua which allows us to u the Gulf of Fonseca , should reached with Ecuador and Cos Rica , permitting our use of t Galapagos and Cocos Islands in case of war . Agreements should definitely be reached with Brazil , ( tacit ones probably already exist ) to permit our use of its airports and harbors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our hold upon the approaches to the Canal . We have stated that we will tolerate no European nation taking over Dutch , British , or French  | possessions in this hemisphere . We should also declare that any change in the status of the Azores would concern us . Definite talks with Canada and Newfoundland should be started , looking toward the use by us of their air bases and harbors in case of war . Accompanying any such program must be political , economic and cultural rapprochement with all Latin America , leading to General Staff understandings . IT IS CLEAR that without a victorious Germany no combination of powers could challenge us . This writer can not accept the contention that German conquest will be complete and overwhelming . If Germany wins she will reap bitter crops ? mistrust and fear by Russia and Italy , the necessity for constant surveillance over conquered peoples , the exhaustion consequent to any major war . Nor does it seem probable that the British fleet intact ever will be surrendered to Hitler . More likely most of it will go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England is defeated ? to foreign ports . Nevertheless we must gauge our defenses against the forces of the combined totalitarian powers ? Germany , Italy , Russia and Japan . They have tremendous strength , but none of it can be put into the Western Hemisphere except by sea or air . While mass bombardment and aerial transportation of troops have proved effective in Europe , we have little to fear from them unless an enemy can establish bases within this hemisphere . And planes can not transport overseas the vast materiel required for such bases . Supplies for a serious attack can be brought to this hemisphere only by ship . Therefore , in considering the strength of our defenses , it is obvious that ships come first and planes second . Our fleet , in being and authorized , will be by far the world 's greatest . The combined tonnage of all four potential enemy navies is now somewhat superior to ours , but in so small a ratio as to offer no danger . Russia is negligible as a sea power . Italy 's fleet is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some of Germany 's ships have small cruising range , for duty in the North Sea . Japan 's navy has been built primarily for service in the Far East . Of the five , then , ours is really the only blue-water navy . The totalitarian powers could muster tenuous superiority only if their own waters were stripped of all naval protection , and even then , our own fleet , a tactical , unified whole , fighting in close proximity to its own bases , aided by shore-based aircraft and submarines , would have an insuperable advantage over a conglomeration of ill-adjusted ships operating thousands of miles from bases . Even our  | small Atlantic squadron , contrary to general belief , would not be a pushover for any power ; nevertheless , it ought to be strengthened . But the Navy has certain weaknesses . It is deficient in specialized ships ? mine layers and net layers , for instance . It has a lot to learn about combined operations ? naval , land and air ? which require the highest coordination of all arms and are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense of this hemisphere . We must maintain our present ratio of naval strength to that of the totalitarian powers ; we must be able to build good ships as rapidly as they , and this our Navy has not proved it can do . OUR strategical problem involves bases and long-range bombers to cover all approaches to those bases . But the operations of these bombers should be closely integrated with the operations of our fleet , for the first line of defense of the Western Hemisphere is primarily a water line . The Navy 's long-range patrol bombers are ideally suited for this job , but we must have more of them . For close cooperation with the fleet we have the scout-bombers , fighters , and torpedo planes of the aircraft carriers , and the catapulted seaplanes of the cruisers and battleships . There is no need t increase this strength ; we already have the largest ship-based air force in the world ; we must merely add sufficient planes to provide air equipment for new ships as those ships are built . THE ARMY has no such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planes are the only type closely attached to individual ground units . The Army has no dive bombers ; these , with attack planes , medium bombardment and pursuit types , should be developed and merged into an  | instrument devoted to one end ? ipport of the ground forces . There lust also be a group of long-range lanes under GHQ command for lierations against objectives far beyond the reach of ground troops . But since we have nothing to fear in the air from Japan , a weak power , and since only a handful Germany 's planes have range enough to cross even the southern Atlantic ? from Africa to Brazil it can be said with some confidence that we do not need an air force of 50,000 planes . The total combat plane strengths of both Army and Navy need not be more Ian 7000 to 10,000 planes , plus serves and training planes . THE HUGE ARMIES of Europe or Asia can not easily be transported this hemisphere , can never be transported if we retain control of e sea and maintain proper air defense . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even if sea control were rested from us , would be 50,00c en . The transportation of such a force would require 375,000 tons of lipping ; once they landed , half of the tonnage of the German merchant marine would be needed to supply them . To supply an army f I , 000,000 men in this hemisphere would require at the very least 3,000,000 tons of shipping . Economically and commercially the problem seems impossible ; not even a combination of Britain and Germany could divert so much shipping to the purpose . We do not therefore have to fear the employment of mass armies in this hemisphere ; the most we have to guard against is the transportation of a small expeditionary force . Then why all this talk about conscripting a huge army ? The induction of huge masses of men into the service may actually hamper the development of a small , highly trained field force , which is our primary problem today in so far as land forces are concerned in hemisphere defense . Our Regular Army must provide garrisons for Army , Navy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Regular Army must provide the nucleus for coast defense and anti-aircraft troops ; it must provide officers to train the National Guard and to form the skeletal structure upon which a large mass army may be built up after " M-Day . " And , under our broadened responsibilities of hemisphere defense , it must provide a field force highly trained , fully equipped , instantly ready for transportation anywhere within the Western Hemisphere ? to quell , with the help of the Navy and air force , alien-inspired revolutions , to seize an advanced base , to hold any area against attack until larger forces are concentrated . Such a force need be no larger than 150,000 men ? perhaps half that number ? about the number with  | which Germany seized Norway . And considering its other functions , the Regular Army need be no larger than 400,000 to 500,00c men . Hemisphere defense is primarily a problem for sea power , secondarily for air power . But it is not a problem which can be solved by any one service , or by the defense forces alone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planning . And in an integrated defense each element of the fighting services and the other branches of government must be nicely articulated , each working not on " He own " but as part of a machine . There seems to be no such tinily of concept in Washington . Our defense forces are , like ' Topsy " jest growin ' . " Wanted above is a plan for defense , a military policy , a definition of what we must defend and against whoa , and the organization to carry out the plan .
