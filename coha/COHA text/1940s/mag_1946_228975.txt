Down South there was Winston Churchill , burrowing his toes in Florida 's sand . In Washington there was the Pearl Harbor Investigating Committee , its Republican members eager to burrow into what pledges , if any , Franklin Roosevelt and Churchill had exchanged before Dec. 7 , 1941 . The temptation was too strong for Michigan 's Senator Homer Ferguson to resist . Hopefully he moved , " in utter seriousness , " that the committee ask the former Prime Minister to be a witness . <P> The Democratic explosion was awesome . Up jumped Pennsylvania 's Congressman John W. Murphy , shouting : " It would ill behoove this committee . ... It would not be showing much courtesy . " Illinois ' Senator Scott W. Lucas cried : " Fishing expedition . . . ridiculous ! " <P> Next day , when temptation and tempers had cooled , the motion was put to vote . Only one Republican-California 's Congressman Bertrand W. Gearhart-joined Senator Ferguson . By a vote of 6-to-2 , the committee let Winston Churchill relax .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
