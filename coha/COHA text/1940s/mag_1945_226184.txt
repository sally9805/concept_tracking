The Dominion Government was caught off base ; it was angry and indignant at the sudden dropping of meat rationing in the U.S. ( see NATIONAL AFFAIRS ) . Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King hastened over to tell the House of Commons his decision : the U.S. could end meat rationing if it pleased , Canada would not . <P> In a voice heated with emotion , prim Mr. King reminded the House that Canada had resumed rationing in September to make " the fullest possible contribution to the needs of the United Kingdom and the continent of Europe . " He had noted during his recent fact-finding visit to Britain that the outlook was now " even more urgent and more desperate . " <P> Under the Combined Food Board ( Canada , U.S. , Britain ) , each country had undertaken " to make its best contribution to the common problems , " King continued . Then he made a pointed comparison : " The United States , in exporting less than 5% of its meat supplies , may be able to manage its program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still be able to maintain fair distribution and fair prices . ... In Canada we could not , without rationing , export between 40 and 50% of our federally inspected one-third the total kill and maintain orderly distribution and hold our ceiling prices . " <P> As King pledged Canada 's continued " best endeavors to meet the perilous situation which confronts Europe as winter sets in , " members from all parties pounded their desks in agreement . Said one top Canadian civil servant : the U.S. action ' " is a hell of a Christmas present to the people of Europe . "
