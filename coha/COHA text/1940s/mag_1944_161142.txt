WEAPONS <P> Far beyond the range of fighter escorts , U.S. Superfortresses bombed Japan with small loss . Last week the Army Air Forces revealed more details of the remote fire-control system which has made the B-29 well able to take care of itself , even against heavy attacks by enemy planes . <P> " Relatively few " - ten or twelve-.50-caliber machine guns and a 20-mm. cannon are the armament the B-29 carries to fight its way in &; out . But the big airplane 's remote-control firing system enables the few to do the work of many . It can throw a multi-gunned punch instantly in any direction . <P> Gunners sitting inside plexiglass blisters sight the target through a small square of glass , track it to get speed , range and angle . A computer of complex and secret design sets electronic and mechanical elements in motion . The computer also makes corrections for such errors as might be caused by wind , the pull of gravity , parallax ( i.e. , the distance between the gunner 's sighting position and the turret he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firing planes . All-electric , from sight to firing pin , the guns respond to the most delicate adjustment . All a gunner has to do is press a switch to start them spitting at a rate of 800 rounds a minute . <P> Control of the B-29 's guns can be interchanged , passed around from gunner to gunner like a basketball and with split-second speed . Thirty different combinations of guns can be aimed and fired from different sighting stations . A gunner lets go control of his guns by simply dropping the firing switch . Another gunner can instantly pick up secondary control and bring his own and his colleague 's guns to bear on a target . <P> Other advantages of the remote-control system , developed by General Electric and Air Forces experts : turrets need be only large enough to house gun mounts , thus reducing the speed-killing drag which would be set up by turrets big enough to accommodate both guns and gunner ; the job of aiming by hand in a rushing slipstream is taken over by powerful machinery ; the gunner can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cabin , insulated from the shock and noise of his rattling armament.
