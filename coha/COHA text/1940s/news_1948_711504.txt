txt A man , a merchandising philosophy , - and a quarter century of hard work have turned a bankrupt filling station property into a $100,000 super-service station business here in northern New Jersey . The man : Henry T. Kiefer , independent filling station operator . The philosophy : Friendly service ; everything the motorist needs in a one-stop package : an eye to the future . The business : " Twin Service Stations , " perched atop the Hudson River Palisades on heavily traveled New Jersey Route 203 , now bread and butter for the 24 people working ' there ; in 1927 , the financial graveyard of three previous operators . The first year he ran the business , Henry Kiefer sometimes thought he would follow his unlucky predecessors . Last year , however , his gross sales were five times 1927 and twice 1941 . Gasoline sales alone in 1947 totaled 843.000 . And gasoline accounts for less than half of Twin Service Stations ' gross . Says a local business man : " Henry has built himself a Ihelluva business from just about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes for success in running a small business !

" It 's taken Henry Kiefer two decades of twelve hours a day , seven days a week toil to develop the Twin Service idea of superservicing for automobiles . The idea 's growth has gone hand in hand with the steady increase in gasoline sales , backbone of the business . And bath have grown with Henry Kiefer 's philosophy of rendering friendly services while keeping an eye to the future . An eye to the future means plans , for five or ten years from now , for a helicopter repair station and an air ferry service to New York City .

A Competitor Speak . up Half a mile down the road from Mr Kiefer 's place of business is " George 's Gas and Service Station . " Says George Jamin : " Henry 's my big competitor and my friendly competitor . He always ran a successful place . But he got into the business in a big way just at the right time , finishing his new station just as the war began . He runs a clean place and he is able to hold on to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around town , Henry takes part in  --  Red Cross , American Legion , all the drives . " Mr. Kiefer is active in his state association , too . In his two decades in the business , he 's experienced several ups and downs in gasoline retailing , including the bitter New Jersey gasoline price wars of the ** " Many retailers failed because of the price wars , and 1 barely survived myself , " he declares . " Only our strong New Jersey Gasoline Retailers Association was able to get fair trade legislation to protect independent dealers . " As an independent filling station operator . Henry Kiefer is a member of a numerous clan . Latest Department of Commerce figures ( June , 1946 ) show 214,000 different people owning businesses selling . gasoline . Actual number of stations probably runs somewhat higher , since some operators own more than one station . In 1939 , filling stations had total sales of a little over $2.8 billion , ranking fourth among retail trade businesses . By last year , the industry had increased its total sales to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the service station business shortly after World War L Following his discharge from the Marine Corps he went to work for a man who owned a garage to Jersey City , N. J. Five years or so later he had saved enough of a Stake to buy a place of his own . His initial plant , on the present site of Twin Service Stations , consisted of 30 individual rental garages , a small headquarters shack , and outdoor repair and lubrication facilities . His big new service station , finished in 1942 , includes a. two-story central office and parts storage building , ? winged yn either side by four indoor repair bays and four lubrication bays . The new $30,000 building is clear of debt , and Mr. Kiefer several years ago bought the land it stands on , his former landlord taking a mortgage for part of the purchase price . Problems Despite Prosperity Despite his prosperity , Henry Kiefer has plenty of problems , too . Like many other gasoline dealers , he finds his profit margin declining steadily these days . Business is booming . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , costs him five times what it did in 1942. the year he moved into his present building Taxes on his $100.000 plant are three times as much . Heat , light and power bills in 1947 were double 1942 . And the payroll for his 13 employcs  --  biggest single expense  --  is three times what it was six years ago . These snowballing costs sometimes make Mr. Kiefer feel he is running his hardest only to stay in the same place . Also . as more and more of his time is taken by the paper work connected with his business , he thinks he is losing the intimate contact he once had So , after 21 years on his present location . Mr. Kiefer sometimes looks hack rather wistfully to the days when he handled the station with the help of one assistant . Nevertheless , he believes he must keep expanding his operations despite the diminishing rate of return . Competition is intense . with over 70 gasoline retailers in the mile-square area . So Twin Service must provide as many Services as possible to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Service customer : e'Everything I need done to my car , I have ' done right here .

Many auto parts are very hard to get . however , and here 's where " friendly service ' conies into play . For ' example , Twin Service has been looking for a stabilizer bar for a customer 's 1937 Buick for the past six months . " I 've made as many as 20 telephone call . to get a part for a customer . and this has become a big item of expense , ' Mr. Kiefer re ; lates . " This is expensive not only because the items are up in price , but because of the time I and expense to locate and get them You ca n't charge that to the customer . " Recently . ' however . Mr. Kiefer has been telling customers needing a very scarce part that they will have to pay for the labor to find it .

He has never had a regular advertising budget , although he occasionally places an ad in local papers or gets out a direct mail piece He also has billboard space at the state automobile inspection station in nearby Union City . N. J . and has telephone listings . He figures he 's spent about 5600 annually in recent years for his advertising .

As in most ether hulsineseee. wages of service station employes vary with their job , experience , and talents . The prevailing wages in the industry in northern New Jersey are about S5 cents an hour for attendants , and from S25 to S75 a week for mechanics of different degrees of experience .

For one , he feels his prosperity is largely In the hands of the tax collectors . If taxes remain high , or go even higher due to European aid and rearmament . Mr Kiefer fears that fewer people will be able to afford the automobiles that he services . Another facet of the future : " Business is getting more compeLtive all the time . " he declares " More people are getting in the filling station business every day . Many of them get licked and have to get out . Meanwhile . they sell their new stations at a loss . Finally some one buys them chean enough to be able to operate at a profit . This obviously cuts into my profits . "
