A SENATE investigation into lend-lease which was really anxious to get at the facts might prove very useful . It could help to make the public better informed about the objectives of the lend-lease agreements with our allies and give some much-needed publicity to the intangible as well as the tangible returns which it is bringing us . It could inquire judicially into many rumors that now pervade and poison the atmosphere of Washington . Have shipments of goods been used for purposes which do not contribute to the war effort ? Have our deliveries matched our commitments ? Have materials or equipment been held back to satisfy private interests in this country ? Has there been waste , inefficiency , or corruption in the administration of lend-lease ? Such matters are the legitimate province of the legislative watchdog , provided its inquiries are carried out in a judicial , responsible , and generous spirit . But who can hope that an investigation in which Senator Gerald P. Nye appears scheduled to play a leading part will be imbued with such a spirit ? Nye has been opposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made it clear that , while he grudgingly accepts the fact that we are at war with Germany and Japan , his personal battle is against Britain and Russia . Moreover , the investigation has been launched under cover of carping criticism and unworthy suspicion . Its original author was Senator Hugh Butler of Nebraska , who has expressed his own sentiments about lend-lease by calling it " the most colossal dole of all time . " It has of course had the support of Senator Burton K. Wheeler , who prejudged the issue by declaring , " The giving away of taxpayers ' money lavishly to every Tom , Dick , and Harry who wants it and asks for it is little less than criminal . " Another source of inspiration was the recent statement by Senator Allen J. Ellender of Louisiana , who sought to prove statistically that " we have been the sucker in the nth degree . " Even if his figures had been accurate , they were wholly irrelevant , for in making comparisons between American war expenditures and debts and those of our allies he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or national wealth . One of his complaints , for instance , was that American lend-lease expenditure of $1,250,000,000 monthly totaled on an annual basis only $3,000,000,000 less than the whole British yearly war bill . In this case he seems to have confused appropriations with actual expenditures , for total United States lend-lease shipments to all recipients up to June 30 of this year amounted to only $4,262,468,000 . In any case lend-lease can not be discussed in bookkeeping terms except on the premises of the " iso-nationalists . " Their basic assumption is that this war is not our war but a struggle we are waging solely for the sake of foreign nations who are certain to prove ungrateful . The fact that Britain and Russia held off the enemy and gave us time to prepare means nothing to them . Only dollars and cents count . Is it not time these cash-register views were vigorously repudiated ? Is it not time that this picture of Uncle Sam as a noble and naive philanthropist turning out his pockets for the sake of swindling bums was scrapped ? Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When America has contributed to the common cause as great a proportion of its resources as have its allies , when its standard of living has been reduced in the same degree as theirs , when its sacrifice of lives is on a similar scale ? then it will be time enough to cast up accounts . G. 0 . P. Tax Policy T HE danger of a complete home-front debacle in the vital struggle against inflation must be regarded as imminent as a result of the open revolt of House and Senate Republicans against any tax program that is at all adequate . If we hold to the military analogy , the action of the Republicans can only be described as desertion under fire . In its eagerness to find a political issue that would embarrass the Democrats in 1944 , the Republican Party appears to have thrown aside not only caution but all consideration for the well-being of the American people . Not content with having endangered the entire price-control mechanism by advocating higher prices for farmers while opposing subsidies , the Congressional Republicans would now abandon the key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through taxation . We need not repeat at this time the basic economic reasons why higher taxes are essential . Secretary Morgenthau and Director of Economic Stabilization Vinson have described the threat of inflation to the Ways and Means Committee of the House as clearly as it is humanly possiThe NATION ble to do so . The President has repeatedly warned Congress that all other anti-inflation measures must fail if taxes are not increased . We can not believe that the Republican leadership is so dim of understanding that it is unable to follow the simple arithmetical calculations that point inescapably to inflation if the excess consumer buying power is not absorbed . Yet in a minority statement issued by Representative Knutson of Minnesota , the Republicans oppose a further tax increase on the ground that it would bring about a liquidation of the middle class and would be " inflationary . " Such an increase , they declare , would " inevitably lead to a demand for higher wages to meet the increased tax burden . " At first glance this statement is just plausible enough to make it an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is dishonest because Secretary Morgenthau presented the committee with figures showing that the American public , chiefly the middle class , will have roughly $42 billion in excess spending power left after taxes and after buying all the goods that can be produced in war time . The figures check closely with estimates made by competent non-partisan agencies . Even more patently dishonest is the argument that higher taxes will cause demands for higher wages . The essence of the Treasury 's tax proposals lay in the fact that they did not increase the burden on the wage-earners in the lowest bracket  --  those earning $2,000 a year and under . Instead , the principal burden would fall on those with incomes ranging between $5,000 and $25,000 a year  --  which is precisely the group that possesses the bulk of the $42 billion excess spending power . When Mr. Knutson referred to the possibility of increased taxes leading to demands for higher wages , he doubtless had in mind the sharp warning of President Murray of the C. I. 0 . that labor would insist on a wage rise to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bears out our contention that the sales tax is peculiarly ineffective as an anti-inflation weapon because it fails to tap the real sources of excess income while placing a heavy burden on those least able to bear it . The Republican demand that the President drop his war duties and " forthwith proceed to set governmental finances in order by effecting needed economies . . . which would obviate the necessity for . . . taxes " is not meant to be taken too seriously . It is always good politics to call for economy just before an election , particularly if it is known that such economies can not be achieved by the party in power . We sympathize of course with the desire to eliminate all unnecessary waste in the war effort . But the practical possibilities of reducing expenditures at this time , regardless of administration , are insignificant as compared with the need for mopping up the surplus spending power which is already in people 's pockets . This basic fact must be grasped not only by members of Congress but by the people back home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago an experienced European statesman in London said to me : " First a second front . After that the other problems will be easy to solve . Without that nothing can be solved . " He scouted the notion that second-front talk was primarily for propaganda or bargaining purposes . " The demand for a second front is a  --  , demand that the Western powers fight Hitler as totally and fiercely as Russia is doing . It is what it appears at face value . " " But what is the use , " I asked , " of pressing a demand when you know the answer ? Stalin had been kept informed of Allied military plans . If a second front has been decided upon for this autumn , it will happen without any further pressure . If it is not scheduled , it will not happen . So the demand must be either propaganda or rhetoric . And Russian diplomacy does n't go in for rhetoric . It seems to me that the Russians are reminding the world , deliberately and for the record , that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record will be useful when an accounting comes . " " No , " he said , " I assure you the thing is both more and less simple than that . The Russians are suspicious to begin with . They never for one hour forget that the Western powers hoped to divert Hitler 's aggression against them . They are under no illusions about the sentiments they inspire in important quarters in your great country . They suspect that even now Britain and the United States are not unwilling to let Russian blood flow ? to defeat Hitler as far as possible by Russian arms . In any case they think both nations are too slow , too fearful of risk , more anxious to save the lives of their own troops than to end the war quickly . And it infuriates them to have Sicily held up in the press as a ' second front . ' They look upon Allied operations there as a small side-show made possible by their overwhelming offensive in the East . One Russian officer here in London said a rather brutal thing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' Allied tanks in Sicily are fueled with the blood of Russian soldiers . ' The agony of Russia , its ten million dead , its razed towns and factories , must be taken into account when you try to analyze the demand for a second front . " But the idea I wanted to give you , " he said , " is that a front in Western Europe  --  a major offensive against Hitler  --  has become for Russia a profound test of Allied capacity and good faith . If it happens , Stalin will be ready to sit down at a table with the rest of them . Until it happens  --  well , he may agree to a conference , but it will be for one purpose ; to demand a second front . " When these words were spoken , the Quebec conference was still going on and the British press was demanding a three-power meeting without further delay . Now the foreign ministers of the three nations are con- 489 ferring , and the first item on the Russian agenda laid before the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the question of a second front . According to Anne O'Hare McCormick , this subject was , in fact , dealt with ahead of those proposed by the other delegates . Was a new promise made by Messrs . Hull and Eden and accepted , in spite of past disappointments , by Mr. Molotoff ? If so , then the other pressing problems stand a better chance of satisfactory solution . For the Russians will approach them with confidence instead of suspicion and resentment . The first of these is the political problem that faces the great powers in the liberated countries of Europe . The second , firmly linked to it , is the problem of organizing security . If Russia follows its own interests , and its own lead , it will insist upon new methods of dealing with the internal political situation in each country . With admirable consistency , the Soviet Government has given encouragement and , where possible , open support to the most vigorous anti-Axis elements all over Europe . Where the United States and Britain have signally failed to use the underground movements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has reached in and worked with them . The tactic of attempting to subvert and use Axis supporters has never appealed to the Russians . They see their national security best protected by a Europe in which popular governments predominate . They fear , and with good reason , a continent ruled by Francos and Petains . Just once has the Soviet government deviated from its support of the democratic forces : when it joined with Britain and America in accepting as a co-belligerent the present Italian regime . Whether this move was an overture to its Allies on the eve of the conference , or whether Stalin believes that military ends will be served by the agreement with Badoglio , one can not say . But in view of the record of the Soviet Union , it seems safe to assume that even while Stalin formally acquiesces in the status quo , he is helping prepare the way for its ultimate collapse . In any case the hope of a workable system of collective security in Europe waits upon the overthrow of the reactionary centers of power  --  whether they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This Russia knows . But it is hard to believe that Mr. Hull , who has strongly and even intemperately defended every act of the State Department in these matters , will be able to meet the more realistic desires of his Russian colleagues . If he fails to do so , the conference might as well adjourn . For even the most unqualified agreements for postwar cooperation will collapse in the face of a Europe which feels itself betrayed by the very powers that promised its liberation . No Badoglio governments will survive an Allied victory unless Allied arms are used to defend them . And a security system erected on foundations shaken with revolt and civil war is not worth concocting. 490 With the Senate still haggling over the vague clauses of the Connally resolution , Mr. Hull is in no position to commit this country to any definite program of collective action . At most he can express the views of the Administration . Perhaps this is not as unfortunate as it appears The NATION on the surface . Much ground will have to be cleared , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be gathered up and thrown away , before collective security can amount to anything more than a pious wish . And Europe is fed up with America 's pious wishes . F. K.
