Catalina A Novel in Three Parts Conclusion W. Somerset Maugham T XXVI D ONI INGO gave Catalina his hand and helped her up onto the horse so that she could sit on the pillion behind him . It was still and warm , but high up in the heavens there was wind and little clouds sped across the sky , black but edged with the silver of the shining moon . The countryside was deserted and they might have been riding in a world of which they were the only denizens . " Uncle Domingo . " " Yes ? " " I 'm going to be married . " " Make quite sure of it , child . It is a sacrament necessary to salvation , but one which men in general hesitate to avail themselves of . " They passed a sleeping hamlet and beyond it was a clump of trees . As they came to it a figure detached itself from their shadow . Catalina slipped off the horse and flung herself in Diego 's arms . Domingo dismounted . " Come , come , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time for that sort of thing later . Get on the horse , both of you , and he off . " The lovers rode for an hour and Catalina talked her head off . She could not imagine anything more like heaven than to ridethrough the night in the open country with her arms clasped round her lover . " I could ride like this to the end of the world , " she said . " I 'm hungry , " he answered . " Let us stop here and see what is in those saddlebags . " They were passing a wood and he reined in the horse . Catalina was well aware that his appetite just then was not for food and drink and a tremor of desire tingled down her body ; but it had needed the admonitions neither of the Prioress nor of Domingo to tell her that it was very imprudent to let a man have his will of you until the Church had sanctified the union . She knew that men have an instinctive disinclination to marry and she had known cases of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them refuse afterward to fulfill their promises . " Let us ride on , dear , " she said . " The Prioress said we might be pursued . " " I 'm not frightened , " he said . He passed his leg over the horse 's head and slipping to the ground lifted Catalina off the horse 's back . She was in his arms and he kissed her on the eyes and on the mouth . He took hold of the bridle and with his arm still about Catalina 's waist made for the wood . But at that moment a sharp shower of rain fell upon them . They were both startled , for the night had seemed fair and they had not noticed the black cloud over their heads . Now Diego was as brave as a lion and would have faced armed men with intrepidity , but he was terrified of rain . Moreover he had put on his best clothes before starting and could not bear to get them wet . " It 's not raining over there , " he said , pointing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road . " Let 's run . " But they had no sooner reached the spot he indicated than the rain suddenly began to fall there too and more heavily . Diego gave an exclamation of annoyance . " It 's only a local shower , " he said . " If we ride quickly we shall get out of it . " He mounted , helped Catalina up , and clapping his spurs into the horse 's flanks galloped down the road . But no sooner had they got away from the wood than the rain stopped as abruptly as it had begun . He looked up at the sky . There were dark clouds behind them , but ahead the sky was blue and serene . They rode in silence . After a little while , perhaps half an hour , they came to a little copse . " This 'll do , " said Diego , reining in the horse . Again the shower came suddenly , as it did three more times before Diego cried in exasperation , " This is the strangest thing I 've ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she murmured . Diego gave it up as a bad job . They went on through the night . At last the sun rose . They were on the top of a little hill and looking down saw in the gray dimness of dawn a small village . They entered the village and suddenly the horse stopped dead . " What 's the matter with you , you brute ? Get on with you , " cried Diego , digging in his spurs . The horse did not move . Catalina began to laugh and he turned on her furiously . " What is there to laugh at ? " " Do n't be cross with me , my love . Do n't you see where we are ? The church . " Diego , frowning , looked and he noticed for the first time that the horse had stopped in front of the church which was on the very edge of the village . Just at this moment the priest , who had been saying his Mass , came out of the church and hurried up to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ providential that this should have oc-curred at the church door , " said Catalina , " for we were looking for a priest to marry us . " She turned her back on them , raised her skirt , and quickly got a gold piece out of the bag the Prioress had given her . With her bewitching smile she showed it on the palm of her hand . " But who are you ? " he asked doubtfully . " Why do you want to be married in a strange place and in such a hurry ? " He did not take his eyes off the glistening coin . " Have pity on two young lovers , father . " " Follow me , " said the priest , and re-entered the church . The ceremony was speedily performed and Catalina Perez was joined in holy matrimony with Diego Martinez . T HE priest had told them that some fif- teen miles along the road was an inn where they could get lodging and there they decided to stay the night . They rode in silence for three or four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked Catalina at last . " Of course . " " I will be a good wife to you . For love of you I will work my fingers to the bone . " " There will be no need for you to do that . There 's plenty of money to be made in Seville by a clever man and no one has ever taken me for a fool . " " I should think not indeed . " ? They were silent again for a while and it was Catalina who spoke again . " What is the matter with you , darling ? " she said . " Nothing . " " Look at me , sweetheart . I 'm hungry for a glance of your eyes . " " How can I look at you when the road is full of ruts and holes ? " " Why arc you vexed with me ? " He took some time to reply . " The showers last night , the odd behavior of the horse this morning . It does not augur well for our future happiness if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occur to let you have your own way . A man should be master in his own home . It is a wife 's duty to yield to her husband 's wishes and it should be her pleasure . " Catalina had her arms round him and he felt them shaking . " You wo n't snake it any better by crying , " he said . " I 'm not crying . " " What are you doing then ? " " Laughing . " " Laughing ? It 's no laughing matter , woman . It 's very serious and I have the right to be disturbed . " " You are very sweet , my darling , and I love you with all my heart , but sometimes you are not very sensible . " " Explain , " he said coldly . " The Prioress told me that I owed the favors I have received at the hands of Our Blessed Lady to my virginity . It appears that in heaven they set great store on that . It may be that when I have lost it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned as far around in the saddle as he could and there was a sly smile on his handsome face . " Blessed be the mother that bore you , " lie cried . " We will put the matter to the test without delay . " " The sun is growing warm . It would be pleasant to rest for a while under the shade of trees till the heat of the day is past . " " That is the very thought that was passing through my head . " " And unless my eyes deceive me there is a wood not more than a mile away that will do very nicely . " He gave the horse a touch of his spurs and galloped hell for leather till they came to the wood . He jumped off and lifted Catalina clown . It was cool and dark under the trees and a trickle of water flowed down the bed of a tiny stream . The spot was propitious . ? XXVII W HEN they emerged from the wood , Diego leading the horse , the sunrays flamed less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assurance doubly sure , " he said . " Trebly , " she murmured , not without a certain smug selfsatisfaction . " That is nothing , child , " he returned with a very pardonable complacency . " You do not know yet of what I am capable . " " You are as shameless as you are adorable , " she said . " I am as God made me , " lie answered modestly . They rode on slowly for six or seven miles and then saw in the mellow light of the late afternoon a disorderly building by the roadside . That was evidently the inn of which the priest had spoken . " We shall be there very soon . Are you tired , sweetheart ? " " Tired ? " she answered . " Why should I be tired ? I 'm as fresh as a lark . " They had ridden a good forty miles and since the day before she had not slept more than an hour . She was sixteen . They were in the plain now and the country stretched widely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been gathered and the fields were brown and dry . Here and there grew a few gnarled oak trees ; here and there a grove of age-old olives . They reached the inn . A group of people were sitting on benches at the door ; they gave the two travelers a glance of curiosity , but otherwise took no notice of them . They appeared sunk in a lethargy of gloom . When the landlord came he told Diego in a surly tone that there was n't an unoccupied bed in the place . A troupe of actors had arrived the day before to give a performance at a neighboring castle where its lord , a grandee of Spain , was celebrating the marriage of his son and heir . The people on the benches , evidently the actors of whom he spoke , stared at the young couple with a somewhat hostile indifference . " But you must find us something , mine host , " said Diego . " We have ridden far and can ride no further . " " I tell you , I have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are sleeping in the stables . " In the Spain of that day innkeepers provided only lodging and the traveler had to bring his food with him . But at this moment the steward of the great lord arrived with a kid and a hunk. of pork so that the actors might be well fed for their coming performance . Grudgingly , Catalina and Diego were told they might have a share . The landlord presently called them in and they sat down to supper , the actors still frowning and indisposed to talk . " And where , pray , is Master Alonso ? " the landlord asked , looking around . " Has he not been told that supper is ready ? " " He will not come , " said a middle-aged woman who played duennas , wicked stepmothers , and widowed queens and was also the wardrobe mistress . " He says he has no heart to eat . " " An empty stomach only makes misfortune doubly hard to bear . " " If you will not think me impertinent , " said Catalina , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is . " T HEY were only too glad to tell her , for it was very much on their minds . The company belonged to Alonso Fuentes , who also wrote many of the plays they acted , and his wife Luisa was his leading woman . Early that morning she had run away with the leading man and taken with her all the cash she could lay hands on . It was a catastrophe . For Luisa Fuentes had been a great attraction and they were well aware that it was she that had brought the money into the box office . Alonso was in despair . He had not only lost a wife , but an actress and a source of income . It was enough to upset any man . Now their tongues were loosened . The men reviled the perfidy of woman and wondered how such a fine creature could throw herself away on the indifferent actor their leading man had been . The women on the other hand asked how any woman could be expected to stay with a bald fat man like Alonso when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Juanito Azuria . The conversation was interrupted by the appearance of the abandoned husband . He was small and plump , no longer young , with the rubber face of theactor of many parts . He sat down morosely . " This is my last meal on earth , " he said , " for after supper I have every intention of hanging myself . " " Have no fear , " the wardrobe mistress murmured to Catalina . " Alonso will not hang himself tonight because he has to give a performance tomorrow , and once an actor always an actor . He wo n't disappoint his public . " " It is not the injury to my honor that has driven me to desperation , " said the actor , " but the loss of the two most important members of my company . We have to play tomorrow , bin how can I give a performance without actors ? " " I could very well play the part of Don Ferdinand , " said one skinny fellow . " You ? " cried the actor-manager scornfully . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice play the part of a gallant , audacious , headstrong , and passionate prince ? No , that is a part I could play , but who is going to take the part of the lovely Dorotea ? " " I know the lines , " said the wardrobe mistress . " It is true that I am not so young as I was .. . " " Very true , " Alonso interrupted , " and I beg to remind you that Dorotea is an innocent virgin of unsurpassed beauty and your mature figure suggests that you may at any moment give birth to a litter of pigs . " " Is it possible that you are referring to Truth with Zeal even Heaven can Move ? " asked Catalina , who had been following the conversation with attention . " It is , " said Alonso , not without surprise . " But how did you know ? " " It is one of my uncle 's favorite plays . We used to read it together . He often said that Dorotea 's speech when she indignantly rejects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the great Lope de Vega has written . " " Do you know it ? " " By heart . " She began to recite , but then , noticing that the company were watching her with curiosity , was seized with shyness and , faltering , stopped . " Go on , go on , " cried the actor . She blushed , smiled , and plucking up her courage . started again and spoke the long tirade to its end with so much grace , pathos , and sincerity that they were all amazed . Several indeed were moved to tears . " Saved , " cried Alonso . " You shall play Dorotea with me tomorrow and I will play Don Ferdinand . " " How could I ? " she said in a fright . " I should die . I have never acted . It is impossible . I should be struck dumb . " " Your youth and beauty will make up for any deficiencies . I will help you . Listen , fair one , you alone can save us . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money . We shall be reduced to begging our bread in the streets . " The rest of the company joined their entreaties to those of Alonso Fuentes'and in the end Catalina agreed , with Diego 's willing consent , to rehearse the play and if the rest thought she acquitted herself with credit to risk a performance ; so after supper the table was pushed to one side and the rehearsal begun . She had a good memory and she had recited the scenes in which Dorotea appeared often enough with Domingo to be tolerably sure of her words . She did remarkably well and Alonso was confident that with another rehearsal next morning she would be competent to appear before an audience . She was flushed and happy and looked so beautiful that he felt certain her inexperience would pass unnoticed . " Go to bed , children , " he said to his company , " and sleep in comfort . Our troubles are at an end . " " But where can we sleep ? Diego asked . " There are no rooms . " " Nonesense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Luisa gone ? And the vile juanito ? You shall have their beds , and both in the same rooml " XXVIII F ; key next morning they rehearsed the play again and then carriages arrived to take them to the Duke 's castle . But at the last moment Catalina 's heart failed her and crying that she could never face the ordeal of appearing before an audience , she begged Alonso to let her stay behind ; he flew into a passion and telling her it was now too late to withdraw bundled her into a carriage and seated himself beside her . She was in a flood of tears , but with the duenna to helphim , he managed presently to calm her and by the time they arrived she was sufficiently composed . A stage had been erected in the courtyard and when the gentry had eaten their fill the actors were summoned to give their performance . The distinguished audience was not a little amused by Alonso in the part of a gay seducer , for it was not one that his appearance made plausible ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music of her voice , and the elegance of her delivery , and when the play was over paid her many fine compliments . The Duchess asked that they should be presented to her and all were astounded by their beauty , the modesty of their demeanour , and their gallant bearing . The Duchess gave Catalina a gold chain and the Duke , not to be outdone , took a ring off his finger and gave it to Diego . Alonso likewise was richly rewarded and the company returned to the inn . They had barely got down from the carriages when Alonso bowed before Catalina . " I will speak bluntly , " he said . " I invite you to join my troupe . " " Me ? " said Catalina , astounded . " Though you still have everything to learn , you have gifts that it would he a sin to waste . You do not yet know how to act . But if you will place yourself in my hands I will make you the greatest actress in Spain . " Catalina seemed unable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the look she gave Diego and now with a smile turned to him . " You have good looks , young fellow , and a fine presence . There is no reason why with experience you should not be able to make yourself useful in suitable parts . " " He can sing like an angel , " Catalina cried . " All the better . There are few plays in which there is not a song or two to enliven the proceedings . Well , what do you say ? " " What do you think , beloved ? " asked Catalina , with her most charming smile . She had in point of fact by now made up her mind to accept it , but she well knew that men like to think they decide matters for themselves . " You will not only be helping me in any difficult situation , " said Alonso , " but you will be benefiting yourselves , for you will visit with me the most famous cities of Spain . " Diego 's eyes sparkled . He could not but see that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twelve hours a day on a tailor 's bench . " I 've always wanted to see the world , " he smiled . " And you shall , my sweet , " said Catalina . " Master Alonso , we will gladly join your troupe . " " And you shall be a great actress . " " Olt ' , old ! " cried the other members of the company . Alonso called for wine and they drank to the health of their new comrades . XXIX s INCE at that time there were no theaters in Spain , plays were given in courtyards where the windows and balconies of the surrounding houses could serve as boxes for the nubility and gentry . The ceiling was the blue heaven except in the height of summer when awnings against the sun were drawn from roof to roof . In front of the stage were a few benches and round the courtyard others , arranged stepwise , for the respectable middle class . The common people stood on the bare ground , the men in front and the women , squeezed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for fear of fire and partly for morality 's sake the performances took . place in the afternoon . The scenery consisted of a single backcloth , and change of scene was indicated by the players ' words . The elopement of Alonso 's wife with the leading man had caused him to change his route and when they had played at Manzanares he set forth with his company for Seville where he knew he would be able to engage an actor for the parts which his own age and appearance prevented him from playing himself . They went first to Ciudad Real , a rich city , and from there to Valdepelias ; they made the ascent of the Sierra Morena and entered Andalusia by the rocky defile called the Puerto de Despenaperros . They crossed the Guadalquivir and at last reached Cordova , where they played for a week ; then , after following for a while the noble river , they came to Carmona , where they gave a performance , and finally reached Seville . Master Alonso engaged the actor he wanted and theysettled down for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a hard life . The inns they slept in were miserable and the beds so bad and filthy that , tired though they were and exhausted by the heat of summer or chilled to the bone by the cold of winter , they often preferred to sleep on the floor . They were bitten by fleas , stung by mosquitoes , tormented by bugs and vexed by lice . When they were playing they rose at dawn to study their parts . They rehearsed from nine till twelve , dined . and went to the theater ; they left it at seven ; and then , however weary , if they were wanted by persons of consequence , the mayor , a judge , a nobleman who was giving a party , off they had to go and give another performance . I T DID not take Alonso Fuentes long to find out that Diego , notwithstanding his good looks and his self-assurance , would never be much of an actor , so he allowed him to sing the songs with which the plays were interspersed , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the other hand he took pains to make an actress of Catalina . He knew his business and had a vivid sense for theatrical effect ; she was an apt pupil and a quick student , so that under his tuition , which was intensive and sometimes brutal , she ceased in time to be a clever amateur and became a competent professional . Alonso was rewarded for his trouble , for she found favor with the public and brought prosperity to the company . He enlarged his troupe and extended his repertory . Among others he engaged a young actress called Rosalia Vazquez , partly to console himself for the loss of his wife and partly to play seconds , for the boy who had been used to play them had by then lost his treble voice and was starting to shave . Moreover Catalina had first one baby and then another , so that it was necessary to have a good enough actress to replace her when childbirth for a period kept her out of the bill . Thus three happy , strenuous years passed . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her and the two children she had borne to Diego made it difficult to continue a life of incessant wandering . Her beauty and her talent had attracted the attention of influential persons and more than one had suggested that she and Diego should form their own company and establish themselves in Madrid . Some in their admiration for her gifts went so far as to offer financial assistance . Now Alonso Fuentes was not only manager , director , and actor , but also author , and every year . mostly during Lent when play-acting was prohibited , he turned out two or three plays . It had not escaped Catalina 's notice that in the plays he wrote presumably to show her off to best advantage the parts he wrote for Rosalia Vazquez tended to become more and more substantial . " Things ca n't go on like this , " she told Diego . And he agreed they could n't . They talked and talked , and then , one day , Catalina conceived the bright idea of sending for Domingo Perez . He had been an actor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally decided to go into management for themselves they might put on one or two of his plays and he would certainly be able to put them in touch with authors . Diego approved , so she wrote to him . She had already written three or four times , first to tell him that she was married , well and happy , and then to announce the birth of her children ; but knowing how bitterly it would grieve her mother , she had thought it better not to say that she and Diego were become strolling players . She asked him now , but without giving any particular reason , to visit them at Segovia . They were spending Lent there , partly because it happened to be Alonso 's native city , but chiefly because his company had been engaged to play a religious drama in the Cathedral at Faster and it was now in rehearsal . It was Alonso 's latest play and he had chosen the life of Mary Magdalen as his subject . xxx D omiraco , always glad of a jaunt , no sooner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packed food and a couple of shirts in the saddle bags , and set out . He was pleased on his arrival at Segovia to find Catalina with her husband and children installed in a decent lodging and delighted to see that she was even more beautiful than before . She was then nineteen . Her face had lost its appealing childishness , but had gained perfection of line . Her figure was as slender as ever and she moved with an enchanting grace . She was a woman now , a very young woman certainly , but a woman of character , sure of herself and conscious of her beauty . " You look prosperous enough , my dear , " he said . " What do you do for a living ? " " Oh , we 'll come to that later , " said Catalina . " First tell me how my mother is and how is everyone at Castel Rodriguez and what happened after we ran away and how is Dona Beatriz ? " " One thing at a time , child , " he laughed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am thirsty . " " Run to Rodrigo 's and get a bottle of wine , dear , " said Catalina , and Domingo smiled when he saw her dive into some recess of her petticoats and taking out a purse give Diego a few coins . " I sha n't be a minute , " said Diego as he went out . " I see that you are prudent , sweetheart , " grinned Domingo . " It did n't take me long to discover that men ca n't be trusted with money and if a man has no money he ca n't get into mischief , " she laughed . " But now answer my questions . " " Your mother is in good health , she sends you her love , her piety is exemplary , and it is doubtless for that reason that the Prioress gives her a pension so that she is no longer obliged to work . " When he had told her all the gossip he demanded news of herself , what she was doing . " Ca n't you guess ? How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wandered over Spain under the burning sun of summer , in the bitter cold of winter , barefoot , not to save your boots but because you had worn out your only pair and with but one shirt to your back ? " " God in heaven , you 're not strolling play-ers ? " " My poor uncle , I am leading woman in the celebrated company of Alonso Fuentes and Diego sings and dances and is a much better actor than Alonso will allow . " " Why did n't you tell me sooner ? " cried Domingo . " I would have brought half a dozen plays with me . " At this moment Diego returned with the wine and while Domingo drank Catalina told him how it had come about that she and Diego had become actors . Then they told Domingo what was on their minds . He was a prudent man and when they had finished , said that he was not prepared to advise diem one way or the other till he had seen them act . " Come to rehearsal tomorrow , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you pleased with your part ? " She shrugged her shoulders , " Not altogether . I play Mary Magdalen . It 's well enough at the beginning , but it falls off in the last act . I do n't appear in the last three scenes at all . I 've told Alonso that as the play is about me I should be on at the end , but he says he must follow Holy Writ . The fact is , the poor man has no imagination . " Diego took Domingo to the tavern to which Alonso Fuentes and other members of his troupe were in the habit of going and introduced him not only as Catalina 's uncle , but also as at one time an actor and now a playwright . Alonso received him with civility andthe elderly scrivener quickly gained the good graces of the company by his wit , his good humor , and his stories of the hardships in the old days of a strolling player 's life . Alonso consented to his attending a rehearsal and he went next day . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eloquence of her gestures , and the grace of her movements . Alonzo had taught her well . She had an ear for verse and a lovely voice . She had gaiety and pathos . She had sincerity . She had power . It was astonishing that in three years she had learned so completely the technique of her art . She seemed incapable of uttering a false note . And her native gifts , her acquired skill , the self-control she had learned by experience were all wonderfully enhanced by her great beauty . When the rehearsal was over Domingo kissed her on both cheeks . " Dearest one , you are very nearly as good an actress as you think you are . " And he advised her to have no fear , to leave Alonso , and set up for herself in Madrid . She flung her arms round his neck . B UT it was not only his desire to see his niece and her husband that had led Domingo to undertake the somewhat arduous journey from Castel Rodriguez to Segovia ; he hoped too to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curious to know how he fared in his exalted station . So , for the next few days while Catalina and Diego were busy with their rehearsals , he wandered about the city and managed to scrape acquaintance with a good many people . From them he learnt that the mass of the population looked upon their Bishop with veneration . They were impressed by his piety and the austerity of his life . But Domingo learned also that he had aroused the hostility of his chapter and of the city clergy . He had been shocked by the looseness of their lives and the negligence with which many of them performed their religious duties . With zeal but with little discretion he started upon a passionate campaign of reform . The clergy , with very few exceptions , bitterly resented his harsh intolerance . Those who dared were openly defiant , the rest contented themselves with passive resistance . The people approved his strictness and did what was in their power to support him . There had been in consequence unfortunate occurrences and the authorities had been obliged to intervene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but strife . W HEN Catalina 's play had been presented , with enormous success before a huge audience , Domingo decided to call at the episcopal palace . He was at length shown into a room no larger than a cell . The Bishop rose and took Domingo in his arms and warmly embraced him . " I thought we should never meet again , brother , " he said with an affectionate cordiality that surprised Domingo . " What has brought you to this city ? " " I am a restless fellow . I love to wander . " The Bishop , dressed as ever in the habit of his order , had aged . He was emaciated , and his lined face was haggard . " How long have you been here , Domingo ? " " A week . " And you have waited so long to see me ? That was not kind . " " I did not wish to intrude on you before , but I have seen you more than once . In the processions of Holy Week and in the Cathedral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the play . " " I have a horror of these performances they give in the House of God . In other cities of Spain they give them in the plaza and I do not disapprove of them since they edify the people , but Aragon is tenacious of its old customs and notwithstanding my protests the chapter has insisted that they should be held in the Cathedral as has been done from time immemorial . I attended only because it was a duty of my office , " " The play was reverent , dear Blasco ; there was nothing in it to offend you . " A puzzled frown darkened the Bishop 's brow . " During these three years I have thought often of our last meeting , Domingo , and of what you said to me . At the time I paid little attention to it . It seemed to me no more than the paradoxical , cynical talk in which you have always indulged . But since I came here , in the loneliness of this palace , your words have haunted me . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is possible that aly brother the baker , modestly doing his duty in his lowly station , has served God better than I who with prayer and mortification have given my life to His service . If so , whatever others think , whatever I myself thought for one rapt moment , it was not I that performed the miracle , but Martin . " The Bishop was silent . He looked at Domingo with searching eyes . " Speak . " he said . " Speak and by the love you once bore me , tell me the truth . " " What is it you want we to tell you ? " " You were certain then that it was my brother who was chosen to effect the cure of that poor girl . Are you certain of it now ? " " As certain as I was then . " " Then why , why was I granted the sign that dispelled my trembling hesitations ? Why did the Blessed Virgin use words that might so easily give rise to a mistaken interpretation ? " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear , " Domingo said . " I do not want to say anything that may be an offense to you . " " Say on , say on , " cried the Bishop with something like impatience . " Do you remember that on the occasion to which you just referred I told you how surprising it seemed to me that among the infinite attributes that men ascribe to God they have never thought of including common sense ? There is still another that has even more completely escaped their attention , and yet , if a creature may venture to judge of these things , it is of even greater value . Omniscience would be incomplete without it and compassion forbidding . A sense of humor . " The Bishop gave a slight start , seemed about to speak , but stopped himself . " Do I shock you , brother ? " Domingo asked seriously , but with a faint twinkle in his eyes . " Laughter is not the least precious of the gifts that God has granted us. it lightens our burdens in this hard world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortitude . Why should we deny a sense of humor to God ? Is it irreverent to suppose that He laughs lightly within Himself when He speaks in riddles so that men , deceived in their interpretation , may learn a salutary lesson ? " " You put things strangely , Domingo , and yet I do not know that there is anything in what you say that a good Christian need re-ject . " " You arc changed , brother . Is it possible that in your old age you have learned toler-ance ? " The Bishop gave Domingo a quick , inquiring glance , as though , surprised by his remark , he wondered what be meant ; and then looked down at the bare stone floor . He seemed to be plunged in thought . After a while he raised his eyes and gazed at Domingo as though he wanted to speak , yet could not quite bring himself to . VERY strange thing has happened to me , " he said at last , " and I have dared to tell no one of it . Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , for you , my poor Domingo , are the only man in the world that I can call my friend . " Once more he hesitated . Domingo , watching him intently , waited . " As bishop of the diocese I was obliged to attend the play they gave in my Cathedral ; someone told me it dealt with the life of St. Mary Magdalen ; but I was not obliged to listen or to look . I abstracted my mind . I prayed . But my soul was weary and disquieted . So it has been ever since I came to this city , I have suffered from distraction and dissipation of spirit . I have felt myself despoiled of everything so that I could neither Jove nor hope . My understanding has been in darkness , my will dry , and I have found no comfort in the things of God . I prayed , as I had never prayed before , that He might see fit to succor me in my deep affliction . I was oblivious of my surrounding-s . I was alone with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I remembered where I was . It was a cry , a cry so moving , so pregnant with significance that against my will I was compelled to listen . Then I remembered that they were acting a play . I do not know what had passed before , but , listening then , I understood that it had reached the point where Mary Magdalen and Mary , the mother of James , bringing spices , came to the sepulchre where Joseph of Armathaea had laid the body of Jesus , and found the stone rolled away . And they entered in and found not the body of Jesus . And as they stood there perplexed a traveler came to them and Mary Magdalen told him what she and the other Mary had seen . And then , because he knew nothing of the terrible events that had taken place , she told him of the capture , the trial , and the shameful death of the Son of God . The description was so vivid , thewords so well chosen , the verse so mellifluous that even if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Domingo , holding his breath , leaned forward eagerly . The speech rolled on line after line . There was a fiery indignation in the voice of that woman who played the Magdalen when she told of the betrayal of Jesus , and a fierce anger seized the multitude in the Cathedral and they shouted curses on the traitor ; her voice was broken with anguish when she told how they had scourged Our Lord , and the people gasped with horror ; but when she told of the agony on the cross they beat their breasts and sobbed aloud . The pain in that golden voice , the heart-rending pathos in it , were such that the tears ran down my cheeks . There was a tumult in my soul . My spirit quivered as the leaves of a tree quiver with a sudden flurry of wind . I felt something strange was about to happen to me and I was afraid . I raised my downcast eyes and gazed at the speaker of those lovely , cruel words . She was of a beauty I have never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , wringing her hands , with streaming eyes , it was no actress , but an angel from heaven . And as I looked , spellbound , on a sudden a ray of light transfixed the dark night in which I had so long languished ; it entered my heart and I was rapt in ecstasy . It was a pain so great that I thought I should die , but at the same time it was a delight so sweet ; and I felt myself released from the body and a stranger to the flesh . At that happy moment I tasted of the wonderful peace that passeth all understanding , I drank of the wisdom of God and I knew His secrets . I felt myself filled with all good and emptied of all evil . I can not describe that bliss . I have no words to tell what I saw and felt and knew . I possessed God and in possessing Him possessed everything . " The Bishop sank back in his chair and his face shone with the recollection of his great experience . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is satisfied in its union with God , so far as in this life it is possible , and it has now nothing of this world to hope for and nothing spiritual to desire . I have written a letter in which I have begged His Majesty to allow me to resign my ecclesiastical offices and dignities so that 1 may retire to a convent of my order and spend the remainder of my life in prayer and contemplation . " Domingo could contain himself no longer . " Blasco , Blasco , the girl who took the part of Mary Magdalen is my niece , Catalina Perez . When she ran away from Castel Rodriguez she joined the troupe of Alonso Fuentes . " The Bishop stared at him with amazement . He was dumbfounded . Then with a sweetness Domingo had never seen on his face before he smiled . " Truly the ways of God are inscrutable : how strange are those He has chosen to lead me to my goal : through her He wounded me and through her He healed inc . Blessed be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for when she spoke those heavenly words she was inspired by Him . I shall remember her in my grateful prayers to my dying day . " XXXI D 06IINGO walked back to his lodging , a skinny , elderly man , with great pouches under his eyes . a reddish nose and not a dozen teeth in his head , an old reprobate in a patched cassock green with age and spotted with wine-stains and the droppings of food ; but he walked on air . He would then , as he had once told the Bishop , have changed places neither with emperor nor pope . He talked to himself aloud and waved his arms , so that passers-by thought he was drunk : and drunk he was , though not with wine . " The magic of art , " he chuckled gaily . " Art also can work its miracles . Et ego in Arcadia flatus . " For it was he , the despised playwright , the dissolute scapegrace , who had written those lines that had so profoundly affected the Bishop . It had come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the first two acts of the play Alonso had written for her . But when she discovered that she had little to do in the last act , while Rosalia Vazquez dominated every moment of the action , she was incensed . She quarrelled with Alonso just long enough to know that she was wasting her breath , and then took her troubles to Domingo . " Stop quarreling , " he told her . " Be gentle and conciliatory to Alonso . And give mi two hours alone with your script of the play : And so that afternoon she had been able to call upon Alonso with her most delightful smile upon her face . " You were right , " she said to him , " but I am an actress and I feel that when I stand at the sepulchre of our risen Lord I should have more to say . " " And what , pray ? " he demanded . " It would be wonderfully effective if I narrated the story of Our Lord 's betrayal and trial and death . It would need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question , " he cried impatiently . " How could I write a hundred lines and re-hearse them in time ? How could you learn them ? " Catalina smiled sweetly . " Well , it happens that my uncle and I have talked it over and he agreed to write the scene himself . I have learned the lines by heart . " - You ? " cried the manager to Domingo . " The eloquence of your play excited me , " said Domingo with sly humility , " so that I was as one possessed . It was as if you were holding my pen . " The manager finally consented for her to recite the lines , and to his astonishment he was moved from the very opening phrase . Before the speech was done he was sobbing and great tears were rolling down his cheeks . He saw that Domingo was crying too . " Well , how was it ? " Catalina said with a cherry smile when she was finished . Alonso tried to make his tone gruff and businesslike . " The lines are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you insist you may play the scene in the performance tomorrow . " We have learned of the profound effect which the lines had upon the Bishop . They . and Catalina 's reading of them , had a more worldly effect upon Rosalia Vazquez . Indeed , the play was hardly done before the entire company of players was rent by a violent quarrel . Everyone shouted and waved at once until Catalina at last quieted them by leaping upon a chair . She announced that she and Diego were leaving the company at once to create their own company and settle down in Madrid . Before night fell , Catalina and Diego and d. dr two children , with Domingo in attend a : : e , left Segovia and set out with high spirit , upon the road . meet again . ' For tomorrow , ' he said , when it is no longer night and not yet day , when you can just see the shape of your hand , your soul will be released from your body . ' " " It was a dream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I beseech you to believe it was a dream . " Don Blasco made a sound which in anyone else you would have called a titter . " Do n't talk nonsense , son , " he said . " It was no more a dream than it is a dream that I am talking to you now . It is no more a dream than this life , with its sin and sorrow , its anguished questions and mysterious secrets , is a dream , a dream from which we shall awake to life eternal which alone is real . " Friar Antonio asked permission to stay by him through the night , and soon Don Blasco fell to quiet sleep . The taper spluttered and went out . It was black night . The hours passed . At last Don Blasco made a slight movement . Friar Antonio in the heavy darkness could not see , but he had the intuition that his dear friend was feeling for the crucifix which hung by a cord round his neck . He placed it in the old man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he felt it lightly held . A sob broke from his throat . In all those years this was the first time that Don Blasco had given him a sign of affection . He tried to look into the eyes that once had shone with so intense a light , and though he could not see , he knew that they were open . He looked down at the hand that gently clasped his over the crucifix and as he looked he was aware that the blackness of night was not so impenetrable ; he looked and he was on a sudden terrifying aware of the shape of an emaciated hand . A faint sigh escaped Don Blasco 's lips and something , he did not know what , told the friar that his beloved master was dead . D OKA BEATRIZ lived to a great age in full possession of her faculties and might have lived longer but for an untoward accident . On hearing of the beatification of her old enemy Mother Teresa of Jesus she had taken to her bed for three days , but when in 1622 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such rage that she had a stroke . She recovered consciousness , but on one side was completely paralyzed and it was evident that her end was near . Fear was an emotion unknown to her and she remained calm and collected . She sent for her favorite friar to hear her confession , after which she gathered her nuns around her and gave them suitable counsel for their future conduct . A few hours later she asked for the Blessed Sacrament . The priest was again sent for . She asked pardon for her sins and begged the weeping nuns to pray for her . For some time she lay in silence . Suddenly in a loud voice she said : MAGAZINE " A woman of very humble origins . " The nuns who heard her thought she referred to herself , and were deeply moved by this mark of humility . But her niece , the sub-prioress , knew better . She knew that the words referred to the rebellious nun who was become Saint Teresa of Avila . They were the last uttered by Dofia Beatriz Henriquez y @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holy Oils were administered and shortly afterward she died . XXXIII I N MADRID , Catalina and Diego were successful even beyond their hopes and Catalina became the rage of the town . Many fine gentlemen sought to obtain her favors , but though she accepted their presents with graciousness they received in return no more than a smile of her beautiful eyes and a pretty speech . She became then as greatly admired for her virtue as for her beauty and genius . She sent for Domingo and he came with a dozen plays in his wallet . She produced two of them . Diego , notwithstanding his comely presence and his assurance , never succeeded in being anything but an indifferent actor . Fortunately , however , he proved himself a good business man and an efficient manager , so that with the years they became rich . They had longbefore agreed that it would be indiscreet to speak of the supernatural occurrences of which Catalina had been the occasion , and so , neither when they were with the strolling players , nor later , did anyone discover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a time had been much talked about . Though , as she suspected , no more miracles took place to disturb the course of their married life . She continued to play the parts of persecuted virgins to an advanced age , and a Dutch traveler who went to Spain in the reign of Philip IV has left it on record that though she had grown corpulent and was several times a grandmother , such was her grace , the melody of her lovely voice , and the magic of her personality , before she had been on the stage five minutes you forgot her age and figure and accepted her without question as the passionate girl of sixteen she was representing .
