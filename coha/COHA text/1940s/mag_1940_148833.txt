Digging a tunnel under the English Channel from Calais to Dover ( 22 mi. ) is a project discussed since Napoleon 's time , repeatedly vetoed by Britain* lest it bring an invader from the Continent . Last week both Britain and France might have devoutly thanked God for such a passageway had it been bombproof . After the abrupt surrender of Belgian King Leopold ( see p. 32 ) , some 600,000 survivors of the northern Allied Armies were locked in a triangular trap between the Lys River , the Artois Hills and the North Sea ( see map ) . As 800,000 Germans on the ground and thousand more in the sky relentlessly pressed the trap 's jaws together . Allied Generalissimo Maxime Weygand with his Armies south of the Somme could do nothing but let General Georges Maurice Jean Blanchard , commanding the condemned forces , fight his way unaided to the tideline , where rescue ships waited . <P> The result was a scene of carnage and valor more concentrated in space &; time than anything modern history ever saw : men by hundreds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men by hundreds of thousands pressing forward in a desperation to surround , slaughter , annihilate . To preserve morale on both sides , and because the arithmetic was next to impossible , true figures on the loss of life were glossed over officially . But it could be guessed that not less than 500,000 men were killed , wounded or captured in seven days on a patch of earth about the size of an average U. S. county ( 970 sq . mi. ) + Additional casualties among the millions of civilian refugees were incalculable . At least 1,000 airplanes were shot down . Every town and hamlet from Boulogne to Cambrai and north to Bruges was shattered by explosives or leveled by fire . Virtually every acre was pocked by missiles , stained with blood , strewn or piled with corpses . <P> Guards to the Rear . Perhaps King Leopold surrendered when and as he did because he knew or suspected that the British were about to withdraw , as they had from Norway , with their host 's Army covering their rear . Certainly his surrender forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the wounded sent first ; a courageous , masterful rear-guard action conducted by General Lord ( " Tiger " ) Gort in full cooperation with the French . <P> When the Belgian surrender fatally exposed their left flank , the British , who were falling back from Arras-Cambrai to Lille , crossed the Lys River to Ypres and formed the east wall of an escape corridor along the Yser Canal to the sea . The flower of their Army , the proud Guards regiments-Coldstream , Grenadier , Welsh , Irish , Scots-had to let their line fold back from the southeast while their artillery and remaining armored units covered the rear .
