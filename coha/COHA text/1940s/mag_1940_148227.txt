The U. S. theatre honors two First Ladies-Katharine Cornell and Helen Hayes . The two are very unlike in appeal . <P> Yearning , slightly throaty Cornell , with her great eyes and grand manner , is chiefly a personality ; Helen Hayes , deft and versatile , is every inch an actress . Cornell , in a sense , never seemed young ; Helen Hayes rose to fame in girlish and flapper parts , came of age as Maggie Wylie in a revival of What Every Woman Knows , slowly gained enough poise and stature to triumph thrice as queen-as Cleopatra , Mary of Scotland , Victoria . <P> Last year Actress Cornell-slightly the older of the two-told her life story ; this week appears Actress Hayes 's . It is told , not by 39-year-old Helen herself , but in a series of letters from her 63-year-old mother to her ten-year-old daughter. * For the reader who can grit his teeth against all Grandma 's " Mary darlings " and " Mary sweets , " and survive all her gushing over Helen , the method has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own horn , and it makes for a fairly frank , highly chatty tone . <P> Helen Hayes went on the stage at five . From child parts to Little Lord Fauntleroy to Pollyanna to the flapper in Clarence , on to the big roles of her mature years , Helen moved steadily forward-and her mother with her . Whenever Helen signed a contract , her mother leaned over her shoulder . Whenever Helen was on stage , her mother stood in the wings . Mother was even privy to the " snares " Helen laid to catch her husband , Playwright Charles MacArthur . <P> Though the book is all Helen , it lacks the cautious , great-lady air that chilled Katharine Cornell 's I Wanted to Be an Actress . Mother shows Helen blowing up at Jed Harris when he did backward somersaults over how she should say the one word " Hello " in Coquette . " I did n't know this was Euripides , " Helen screamed . " I wo n't go on until you get out of here ! " ( He got out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , quotes her famed " Any one who wants my piano is willing to it , " to which George S. Kaufman replied , " That is very seldom of you , Helen . " <P> *LETTERS TO MARY : The Story of Helen Hayes - Catherine Hayes Brown-Random House ( $3 ) .
