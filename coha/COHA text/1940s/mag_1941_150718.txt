A thousand feet below the fat belly of the cargo plane , the Virginia countryside had a wicked look . Rocks , scrub trees , creeks , fences , power lines looked as if they lay in wait there , in the blue summer haze . <P> Legs akimbo , half lying on their parachute packs , nine Marines lounged on the bare metal floor . The tenth stood before an open hatch in the side of the plane . A little older than the others , he was the sergeant and jump-master ; he would be the first through the hatch . Now , while the plane rushed toward the spot chosen for this practice jump near Fredericksburg , his hands were raised above his head , gripping a cable which ran the length of the cabin . <P> One of the youngsters on the floor struck up a song : I 'm a ramblin ' wreck from Georgia Tech . The others joined in for a moment , then the song faded out . Another tried a ballad about a certain Nelly . That , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one of the singers a tiny rim of white began to show . Among the seated men ran a quick patter of jokes : about limber legs , and that old feeling below the knees , and how lucky they were to be jumping from 1,000 feet instead of 750 , which is pretty low for a safe jump , even with parachutes which open very quickly . Most of the squad had made ten or twelve jumps before . They were not afraid to jump , they said ; it was the waiting that got you on edge . <P> Ahead of them , below the left wing of their plane , an identical ship carrying ten more jumpers heeled into position . This was to be a formation jump , with everything precisely timed and spaced for wind and distance . <P> The sergeant standing by the hatch suddenly turned and spoke . His men clattered to their feet . Trailing from the back of each man 's pack was a 15-foot " static cord , " with a buckle on the free end . Each man reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overhead cable . They crowded into line , right hand on the shoulder of the man in front , shuffled toward the hatch . The sergeant tensed his body , flexed his knees down and out , dived . His static cord whipped straight behind him , tightened , yanked the canvas cover from his ' chute . <P> Before the sergeant 's ' chute had billowed into a white cloud just below and behind the plane 's tail , the second man had jumped . Within ten seconds , the cabin was empty . The ' chutes drifted compactly together , behind the clump from the other plane , scudding swiftly downwind . The crews aboard the planes circling overhead saw the first jumpers hit ground , roll , vanish among their flattening parachutes . A flight sergeant yelled : " Hell , they 're in the trees ! " Some of the ' chutists had indeed gone into the trees ; one landed in a creek . Damage : a couple of ripped ' chutes , no injuries . <P> The Best They Can . Thus ended last week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paratroops : Company A , Second Parachute Battalion . For Captain Robert Hugh Williams , Company A 's commander , the day 's jump was his 13th.
