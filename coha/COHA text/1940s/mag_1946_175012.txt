Labor <P> He was a hefty , 62-year-old locomotive engineer , Steve Jackson of Kansas City , Mo . Said he : <P> " Now you take the matter of watches . I paid $96 for mine . It 's got ta be cleaned every 18 months and inspected twice a month-it ca n't ever vary over 30 seconds . Now , when I got to have it inspected in Ft . Scott , the Kansas end of my run , I got to walk ten blocks out of my way . What I want is for the company to pay the $3.50 for the cleaning and give me two hours twice a month for inspection time . See what I mean ? " <P> Switch Foreman William Gunter , who has spent 36 of his 62 years with the Wabash Railroad , broke in : <P> " There 's this night differential pay raise of 10 an hour we 're asking . Night work 's tricky in the yards . Maybe your lantern goes out . Maybe you miss a moving step in the dark . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Now , here 's another mighty important matter , " boomed Jackson . " Say a freight engineer has to lay over in Ft . Scott 18 hours . For 16 of those hours he does n't get paid . And for all practical purposes , he 's working . He 's on call all the time and he ca n't go out to a movie or even for a beer . <P> " For two of those hours he gets paid at his regular rate-that is , unless he gets a fast , light freight back to K.C. and makes it in five hours instead of eight . Then the railroad does n't pay him for the two hours penalty time . Why , I do n't know . We 're asking that the engineer gets paid for those two hours , no matter how fast he gets back to K.C. And we also want the penalty time to begin after twelve hours instead of after 16 . " <P> Jackson drew a long breath and Switchman Gunter took it up from there . " Suppose the dispatcher holds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a spot for it . The crew does n't get paid the first 15 minutes he 's fiddling around . And then there 's this assigning crews to different types of work . Say a crew 's worked eight hours on a packinghouse job and the yardmaster says to make up another train afterwards and it only takes two hours . We want eight hours pay for the second job . " <P> " Now , here 's a few other things , " resumed Engineer Jackson , deliberately . " We want sick leave , and vacations with pay . And if we got to make a statement to a claim agent we want to get paid regular time for it . And then there 's this technical matter of terminal pay . " <P> If Engineer Jackson wanted to get technical , he could have rattled off any number of the bewildering rules that govern his brotherhood and the rail operators . Most of the rules were 40 years old , or older ; many were outworn ; many no longer made sense . It was a rare railroader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Government factfinders , running into brotherhood demands for such rules changes as ice water for cabooses , free cleaning and pressing of uniforms , desks for passenger conductors and proposals that would result in seven days ' pay for one day 's work , threw up their hands . <P> When the operators countered with changes that proposed to wipe out all the gains in working conditions that the brotherhoods had made in 50 years of bargaining , the factfinders threw in the sponge . Under the strike settlement , another year would be taken to straighten them out .
