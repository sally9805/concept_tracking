In their small , gilded chamber at Westminster early last week , peers heard a favorite Socialist boast repeated . White-haired Viscount Addison , Laborite leader of the House of Lords , exulted : " It is a remarkable fact-indeed it is an unprecedented fact-that this government , with their large majority in the House of Commons , after two and a half years have not lost a single by-election . " <P> Two days later , in the Glasgow slum of Camlachie , men in grimy cloth caps and women in shawls trudged out to vote . Result : Conservative Charles McFarlane , a black-browed hardware manufacturer , squeaked to a 395-vote victory over Labor 's John M. Inglis , an engine driver . Winston Churchill wired " heartiest congratulations . " It was the first time since 1945 ( and in 23 tries ) that a Tory had won a Labor-held seat in a by-election . But the " glorious victory " the Tories exulted in was not clear-cut ; three independents had sapped about 2,500 votes from Labor 's strength . <P> Many a Socialist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Labor 's wise friend , came a sharp , cautioning admonition : " An astonishing period of immunity from the natural ills of the political flesh is over . . . . Camlachie 's chief warning is. . . that a government candidate can not even rouse the slums. "
