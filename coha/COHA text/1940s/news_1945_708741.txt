txt Cambridge has gone and done it again ! For the fourth time in as many years it has set an example for Boston and some other communities by reducing its tax rate another two dollars . This brings the Cambridge tax rate down to $35.90 , which constitutes a reduction of 510.40 in the last four years since 1941 when the City Manager-Proportional Representation form of government was chosen by Cambridge citizens . In announcing the new tax rate td the Cambridge City Council today , City Manager John Atkinson pointed out that this is the lowest tax rate the city has enjoyed since 1933 , notwithstanding the fact that Cambridge in the latter year had $16,000,000 more in assessible property than it has at present . The figure was not arrived at by " jacking up " total city assessments as was largely the case in Boston where the rate jumps $2.60 this year regardless of a $37,000,000 increase in valuations . A surplus of some $287,000 , ivhich Manager Atkinson said today represented savings by the city effected by cutting down expenditures , was employed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whether the Cambridge tax rate will drop any lower in the next few years will depend greatly upon the increase in taxable property , the City Manager told the Council today . Manager Atkinson said he felt a tax rate of $35 should be the aim of the city . " We have every reason to look forward to a real prosperity in the building field in the postwar period , because of the shortage of manufacturing space and of new residences in Cambridge , I believe that the 101 years following the war , " Mr. At-1 kmson predicted , " will result in an increase in taxable property of between $15,000,000 and S20,000,000 . Our future as far as the reduction of our tax rate is concerned , depends greatly upon the increase in taxable property and , by an inverse process , we can also say the lower we bring our taxes the greater possibility we have of attracting new manufacture and residential investment to Cambridge . " The Cambridge tax rate , which in 1941 had reached a high of $46.30. was decreased . $2.40 in 1942 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
