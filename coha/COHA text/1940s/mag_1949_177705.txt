TOMORROW WE REAP ( 384 pp. ) - James Street &lt; &; James Childers-Dial ( $3 ) . <P> <P> Nine years ago , James Street published the first of his series of novels of the Dabneys , Oh , Promised Land . The first book was 816 pages long , the next , Tap Roots , 593 pages , the third , By Valor and Arms , 538 pages . They told the story of <P> Sam and Honoria Dabney and their descendants ; how they settled in Mississippi , fought Indians , traded in slaves , cleared land , built roads , made fortunes , formed the Free State of Lebanon ( in opposition to the Confederacy ) during the Civil War . <P> Author Street 's historical romances had everything that such books need : swaggering heroes , beautiful women , villainous ( and noble ) redskins , shocking rapes and seductions and massacres , as well as action everywhere and all the time . If readers tired of the floggings , the snakes , the brains splattered on the deck , the hussies driving strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like the passage of the ironclad Arkansas through the Union fleet at Vicksburg . <P> Between installments of the Dabney saga , Author Street , a onetime Baptist preacher and former newspaperman , wrote a novel of contemporary Mississippi , In My Father 's House , and The Gauntlet ( TIME , Dec. 24 , 1945 ) , which sold 800,000 copies . In the midst of writing Tomorrow We Reap , which carries the Dabney clan beyond 1893 , he bogged down , doubted that he could finish the book . Alabama-born James Childers ( Laurel and Straw ) , an Air Force colonel in World War II and a Dabney fan , volunteered to help him . The result is unspectacular , although followers of the Dabneys will want to read it to find out what happened to the grandchildren and great-grandchildren . It is a more orderly and down-to-earth book than its predecessors , its characters more credible , its melodrama more restrained . But it is oddly less interesting for being more plausible , and less convincing for being closer to a recognizable environment . Part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been trimmed down to the proportions of a cinema scenario . Part of it is that the flamboyance and stage effects of the earlier books do not mix with the doings of backwoods storekeepers or squabbles over right-of-way . But the deeper trouble is that Author Street 's view of history , like that of most contemporary historical novelists , does not produce much of dramatic interest when applied to events after the Civil War .
