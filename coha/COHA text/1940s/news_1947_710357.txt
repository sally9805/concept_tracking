txt President Truman began his last ditch stand tonight against the Republican fight to cut taxes . Truman disclosed that there will be a surplus of 11/4 billion dollars in the treasury at the end of the fiscal Year on June 30 , instead of the 2 billion 300 million dollar deficit he was predicting in January . But he raised again his administration 's old spectre of " inflation " as what the taxpayers may expect if the Republicans refuse to acknowledge that the New Dealers know best what 's good for the country and reduce taxes . Gives Self the Credit Tho President credited the government 's improved financial post . tion to his own economies and increased government revenues resulting from what he termed " the extraordinary high levels of economic activity that have been achieved . " But he hastened to disclaim any business improvement resulting from the Republicans ' removal of the New Deal planners ' control over the nation 's economy . Instead , he said the increased government revenue Was partly accounted for by sharp price increases that he blamed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ congress guffawed at the language the President used to describe business prosperity and attributed the improvement to the return of free enterprise after years of the Roosevelt  --  Truman planned economy . Chairman Knutson IR. , Minn. of the house ways and means committee , which wrote the house passed bill to cut Income taxes 20 to 30 per cent , said : " I 'm not aware of any economics effected by this administration that helped build up a surplus . The surplus Is due entirely to Increased tax receipts , thanks to war time rates . " Regardless of the President 's feelings , congress will pass tax reduction legislation , and if he wants to veto it , he will have to answer for it to the people next year . " Receipts Show Gain Discussing the budget situation In detail in a public statement , Tru ? man said expenditures will amount to 411/4 billion dollars , or 11/4 billion less than he estimated In January . Receipts will aggregate 421/2 billion , an Increase of VA billion over the January estimate . Truman said a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2.6 billions last Tuesday , but that heavy expenditures in the last part of the fiscal year will reduce this to 1 ' /4 billion . The President made no mention of his global spending schemes , insisting instead that he wants to balance the budget and reduce the public debt . Administration critics said , however , that his proposed 400 million dollar Greek  --  Turkish aid plan and the world-wide lending it is expected to produce are the real ) reasons why the New Deal Is opposed to cutting taxes . Lucas Fights Tax Cut Sen. Lucas CD. , Ill. , ardent New Deal follower , was aboard the Truman bandwagon before it started . He announced earlier in the day that he would introduce a bill in the senate Monday to block any tax re . duction for 1947 . Lucas said his bill would produce the same reduction as the Knutson bill  --  only on 1948 Income taxes . He said its main points are : 1 . Raise personal exemptions from $500 to $600 , thus removing 3,200 , - 000 low earning taxpayers from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married couples to split their income for federal tax purposes , thus lowering surtax rates , as married couples may now do under the community property systems existing in California and eight other western states . 3 . Reduce surtax rates two points in each bracket .
