txt FARLEY SHOWDOWN IN STATE CAMPAIGN WAITS ON PRIMARY Defections From Bennett and Mead Ranks Expected to Be Public Knowledge by Then RESULT NOW IS CLOUDED Attempt Made to Smoke Out Senator on MarcantonioRival Also Questioned By WARREN MOSCOW With only two full weeks remaining before the delegates begin assembling for the Democratic State convention Aug. 19 , the results were still in doubt yesterday in the fight for control of the party in the State , being waged between supporters of President Roosevelt and the New Deal and the State organization headed by James A. Farley . The New Deal drive to stop Attorney General John J. Bennett Jr. , Mr. Farley 's choice , and obtain the nomination for Senator James M. Mead , under way for about two weeks , has resulted in the following developments : The larger counties in the State that previously had been unpledged to Mr. Bennett , headed by Manhattan , Bronx , Albany and others , have all come out for Senator Mead , as have President Roosevelt , Governor Lehman , Senator Robert F. Wagner and other party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up-State , as well as a county delegation or two previously placed in the Bennett camp . Kings Delegation Stays Put The crucial Kings County delegation , pledged to Mr. Bennett , has yet to reveal any open break in its ranks , although the possibility of such a break will remain right up to the eve of the convention , unless the opposition to Mr. Bennett should crumble before then . The Farley ranks have held surprisingly well in the face of the prestige , power and patronage of thr , combined opposition . Yesterday Mr. Farley claimed , with apparent confidence , a continued substantial majority of the 1,014 delegates , although apparently willing to reduce his majority somewhat . Leaders of the opposition to the Bennett candidacy said their total of delegates reached 550 , or more than a majority , over the weekend , but admitted that they were counting part of , Brooklyn into this total . Another development yesterday was the news that James C. Sheridan , former Democratic leader of Queens County , had come out for Senator Mead . The extent of Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The present Queens leader , James A. Roe , is strong for the Bennett candidacy . Way Lines Are Drawn In the battle , which friends of Mr. Farley show no hesitancy in saying involves control of New York State for the 1944 Presidential campaign , the lines have been drawn about as follows : Mr. Farley has on his side his personal knowledge of virtually all of the delegates and county and district leaders ; the loyalty of a great many of them- the feeling of // FARLEY SHOWDOWN WAITS ON PRIMARY // a great many from up-State that because Mr. Bennett would run well hi their counties , he would make the best candidate for Governor ; the underlying dislike for some of the aspects of the New Deal and the New Dealers on the part of Democratic party organization people , plus his own shrewd political generalship . The opposition has the patronage , prestige and power of the National Administration , and to some extent , the State administration at its disposal , although no one has as yet charged that patronage is being used in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of many that the party can not win without the blessing of the President for its candidate , and that the American Labor party , which has opposed Mr. Bennett , is also vital to its success . An additional factor , and one that may play a part in Brooklyn , is the belief on the part of many that Mr. Bennett would not run well in the heavily New Deal districts of Brooklyn , the Bronx , and part of Manhattan . Young Candidacy Hinted Mr. Farley 's friends believe that Senator Mead 's availability as a candidate has been dissipated , principally because of Mr. Farley 's own statement that Senator Mead would make " a terrible Governor , " and they believe that when the time comes , Owen D. Young , upState industrialist and milk farmer , will be revealed as the real New Deal choice . They say that this will not affect the result , since the Buffalo delegation , as well as some others , would immediately switch back to Bennett . Backers of the Mead candidacy take an entirely different viewpoint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ switch by the White House to Mr. Young , and they maintain that on the present line-up , Senator Mead will be nominated . Mr. Parley is counting on the support of Mr. Bennett by President Roosevelt if , although he admits no " if " in the matter , Mr. Bennett is nominated . Opposition sources , chiefly in labor circles , see no necessity for the President to support Mr. Bennett , on the theory that if he stays aloof , and Mr. Bennett should be defeated , the power of the White House will have been shown , after the fact , in such a way as to prevent future deviations from White House leadership by the party here . The actual show-down in the battle , which has aroused nation-wide interest , as indicated by press clippings and cartoons in the possession of both sides , is likely to be postponed until after the delegates are elected in an uncontested primary election Aug. 11 , a week from tomorrow . Whatever defections from either side are coming should begin to be public knowledge between then and Aug. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mead Speaks Here Today Senator Mead was understood to be in New York City for conferences last night and he will make his first public appearance here today since the day that President Roosevelt , two weeks ago , came out in his support . He is scheduled to speak at a luncheon of the New York State Retail Merchants Association at the Hotel Pennsylvania and also to hold a press conference , the latter probably at his headquarters at the Hotel Roosevelt . With knowledge that Senator Mead would be in town , Mr. Farley , at his press conference yesterday , propounded six questions that he suggested newspaper men ask the Senator today . All six questions stressed the support of Mr. Mead by the left wing of the American Labor party , headed by Vito Lviarcantonio and Eugene P. Connolly , and read as follows : " Will you see Eugene Connolly or Vito Marcantonio while in New York today ? " Have you seen either of them recently or have you been in touch wi'h them ? " Will you support Vito Marcantonio for Congress if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidate in all three party primaries . " In view of the word ' group ' in the statement declaring that any group has the right to support Senator Mead , does this mean your approval of group government which brought about the downfall of France ? " Does Luigi Antonini Right Wing A. L. P. leader approve of your acceptance of Left Wing sup-port ? " Are you happy over the support of your candidacy by The Daily Worker ? " Questions Put to Farley The Mead forces , claiming fourteen additional delegates from four undisclosed up-State counties over the week-end , countered by asking some questions of Mr. Farley . They were contained in a statement issued by Terence J. , Mead campaign committee chairman . The statement referred to the Jackson Day dinner in New York City in January , 1938 , and charged that Mr. Farley was responsible for the handing out to county committeemen attending the dinner of sealed envelopes containing mimeographed statements suggesting that they familiarize themselves with the record of Attorney General Bennett . " Is there a familiar ring to Jim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harmony with the party ; that Bennett was all for Bennett ; and that he always campaigned alone , never assisting or aiding the other candidates ? " the statement asked . " Let 's have a ' Yes ' or ' No ' answer to these questions , Jim . " And while you are answering them , let 's have a plain , blunt ' Yes ' or ' No ' to two other pertinent questions : " 1 . Will you support the nominee of the Democratic Convention , whoever he may be ? " 2 . Will your candidate , Attorney General Bennett , support the nominee chosen on the floor of the convention ? " Every supporter of Jim Mead has willingly given his pledge to do this . And last night , to add to the day 's question bee , John S. Thorp , Democratic pro-Bennett chairman of Nassau County , announced that he had sent to all of the county leaders backing Senator Mead , and to Senator Wagner as well , the following telegraphic question : " Do you approve or repudiate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as reported in today 's press ? "
