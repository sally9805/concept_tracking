The political news of the week was that Franklin Roosevelt had apparently been persuaded to let the Democratic convention choose its own candidate for Vice President . This decision was partly the result of relentless pressure from the Southern conservatives in his own party , partly the product of counsel from New Dealers who prize victory higher than Henry Wallace . <P> The new strategy , as it leaked out from high places : Franklin Roosevelt , after he himself has been renominated , is expected to let the convention know that , while Henry Wallace is his personal choice for the Vice Presidency , he will not insist on him . The convention may then pick anyone it wants . <P> Washington was full of rumors of what Harold Ickes said to Sidney Hillman , what the President told Claude Pepper , and the earnest confab between Jimmy Byrnes and Frank Walker at a Cabinet <P> meeting . All the comments were off-the-record , but the sum total of the rumors was : Henry Wallace is washed up . <P> The idea of a half-free , half-open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old Jesse Jones published a signed front-page editorial in his Houston Chronicle denouncing the recent anti-New Deal revolt in Texas . The wiseacres reasoned : Jesse had waited until . the Southerners had won their bargain , i.e. , the dropping of Henry Wallace , before blasting the rebels , who are far closer to his heart than the New Dealers . In Columbus , National Chairman Robert Hannegan turned up with his own list of seven Vice Presidential possibilities . He then hurried to Washington and an hour-long conference with Franklin Roosevelt ( of which not a word leaked ) . <P> The Old Faces . But one trouble with Bob Hannegan 's list , and all the others put out by newsmen and dopesters , was that they all had the same old faces . Newest face was that of Oklahoma 's rambunctious , New Dealing Governor Robert S. Kerr , who last week was busy trying out his convention keynote speech on his six-year-old son . ( According to one dispatch , the son was bored . ) <P> As for the rest , there was Missouri 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ border state ) ; Speaker Sam Rayburn ( who should please the South ) ; Virginia 's Senator Harry Byrd ( who might attract a stray conservative vote ) ; Senate Leader Alben Barkley , Economic Stabilizer Jimmy Byrnes , WMC Boss Paul McNutt and even such outsiders as Utah 's Senator Elbert Thomas and Tennessee 's Governor Prentice Cooper . <P> In the end the arguments in favor of each man boiled down to nothingness . But in the convention scramble , Henry Wallace , back this week from Siberia and China , would have considerable strength of his own . Cracked one high Administration official , himself a Vice Presidential possibility : " Nobody votes for a Vice <P> President . Go back to 1940 . McNary was the Republican candidate and Willkie lost Oregon ; Wallace was the Democratic , and Roosevelt failed to carry Iowa . "
