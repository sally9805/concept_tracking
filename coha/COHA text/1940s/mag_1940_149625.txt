Last week Wendell Willkie made the tenth major speech of his campaign . Ten more were planned for the next fortnight . Win or lose , his case was becoming clear . With his remarks at dozens of rallies , his rear-platform comments at innumerable stops , his occasional statements to the press , the Willkie case added up to a body of writing that was more than ordinary campaign literature . It was plain that by election eve Willkie partisans would know what body of ideas they were voting for , Willkie opponents would know the arguments they were voting against . <P> Ten Willkie speeches fitted into a pattern in which specific legislative and economic proposals alternated with general discussions of Wendell Willkie 's basic political views . In Los Angeles he talked of taxation , in San Francisco , of foreign policy , in Portland , of power , in Seattle , labor , in Omaha , the farm problem , in Cleveland , defense , in Pittsburgh , again labor . But between these talks that bore on what he planned to do if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ democratic education ( Coffeyville ) , to the position of women in democratic and totalitarian societies ( Detroit ) - as if he were attempting to link moral , educational and ethical issues with his case for a freely competitive , economic order and the system of government based upon it . Underlying these two themes was another-his denial of the doctrine of class struggle in America , a denial that he preached in terms of his own career , and which he dramatized by talking to stockyard workers who listened silently , Tacoma factory workers who listened thoughtfully , Michigan automobile workers who greeted him with boos . <P> Concrete proposals in the Willkie case : <P> Taxation . Willkie opposed the New Deal 's tax structure as unscientific , repressive , loaded with punitive measures , because it " put a premium on the investment of money in all types of Government securities , and drives money out of productive enterprises . " His main points : with normal recovery the U. S. should have had 700,000 new business enterprises in the past seven years ; present tax laws place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily borne by larger , well-established firms . His remedy : " The best tax system in the world will not balance the budget for us at the present time . . . . The best we can do is to stimulate production immediately and revise the tax system so that it will not act as a brake upon industry . " He proposed to set up a tax commission immediately upon election , find out the answers to three questions : 1 ) what the present tax structure will yield " when business really gets going " ; 2 ) the real national income at full employment ; 3 ) the possible tax revenue when the national income reaches full height .
