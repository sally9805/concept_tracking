txt ALBANY , Sept. 14 ? Gov . Thomas E. Dewey , Republican candidate for President , cautioned his party against overconfidence today in commenting on yesterday 's GOP sweep in the Maine State elections . Mr. Dewey and those closely identified with his campaign are particularly fearful that a " we ca n't lose " attitude may develop as a result of the top-heavy Maine Republican vote and public opinion polls that show the Dewey-Warren ticket far out in front . Such an attitude , they fear , could cost the Republicans control of the Senate even if it does not result in loss of the Presidency . " The Republican vote in Maine is very gratifying and I hope it will be taken as a stimulus to even more intensive work by Republicans throughout the country , " Mr. Dewey said this morning when he learned that the Republican margin in Maine was higher than at , any time in the last twenty-one years . The Presidential candidate sent telegrams this morning to Mrs. Margaret Chase Smith congratulating her on her election : to the Senate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as governor . Congratulatory messages were sent also to the sue // cessful Republican Congressional candidates . Mr. Dewey also issued a formal proclamation today fixing next Saturday as Air Force Day in New York . In it he asserted that air power has become America 's first line of defense and must be given an increasingly powerful role in the Military Establishment . Referring obviously to the current tension in Berlin , the proclamation said : " We propose to do everything within the compass of human ability to avoid another war , everything compatible with our national safety and preservation of freedom . We propose to make and keep America strong , so strong that no aggressive power will ever be misled into attacking us on the assumption that our democracy is too weak or too gullible to protect itself . We intend to have an establishment of highly trained military personnel which will be ready for any emergency as the best available insurance against war . " In such an establishment the United States Air Force must have an increasingly powerful part . Air power has become our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Democrats can regain control of the Senate while losing the Presidency , Mr. Dewey is planning a large number of back-platform appearances in states where close Senate races are in prospect during his western trip that starts next week . Speeches to Spur Interest As another means of spurring Republican interest in these states , which ordinarily would rate little attention because of the few electoral votes involved , Mr. Dewey is contemplating delivering some of his major speeches there . The Governor has been scheduled to , pass most of one day in Colorado , where there is a prospect that the Republicans can pick up a Senate seat now held by a Democrat and the greater part of another in New Mexico where a similar situation exists . Although the schedule for the second week of his trip has not yet been announced it is probable that it will provide for a number of appearances in Montana , where there is a chance that Senator James E. Murray can be replaced by a Republican , and in Wyoming where Senator Edward Robertson , a Republican , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Dewey 's visitors today included Mrs. - Oveta Culp Hobby , former Commander of the Wacs and now executive vice president of the Houston , Texas , Post .

J. Strom Thurmond , of South Carolina , the states rights candidate . The main purpose of her visit , she added , was to discuss with Mr. Dewey . the clarification of state titles to offshore oil producing lands . A recent SupremeCourt decision that held the Federal-Government had a " paramount inter ' est " in these lands could cost the Texas School Fund over $1,000 , - 000,000 in the next fifteen years , she said . At present royalties received by Texas from offshore oil production on the Gulf Coast are paid into this fund and then divided among local School districts in Texas . Mrs. Hobby said she found Governor Dewey in sympathy with the proposal that states should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the states of their " historic rights to offshore and submerged lands is one of the planks in the Rublican national platform .
