In a hospital room in Iowa City , death came last week to the most famed artist in the U.S. For two months he had fought a losing battle against cancer of the liver . At his bedside his old friend Thomas Benton had helped him toast the Midwest school of U.S. realism which they and John Steuart Curry had founded and brought to national fame . The trio would henceforth be a duet . Grant Wood was dead at 50 . <P> To the U.S. public Grant Wood was a homely , honest lowan whose art , unlike most of his contemporaries ' , spoke directly to the man in the street . His meticulous paintings of plain U.S. landscapes and plain U.S. people were hung in the smart art salons of 57th Street ; they also appeared in ads and on magazine covers ( TIME , Sept. 23 , 1940 ) . After Whistler 's Portrait of the Artist 's Mother , Wood 's austere portrait of the typical Iowa farm couple , American Gothic , had become the most popular of all U.S. paintings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the age of 38 , Painter Wood 's life was a constant fight against poverty . He was born in 1892 on a farm in Iowa 's rolling Jones County . When his farmer father died , the Wood family moved to nearby Cedar Rapids , where ten-year-old Grant helped support his mother and three other children by doing chores for the neighbors . After working his way through high school , he drifted about the Middle West as a jewelry craftsman , a night watchman in a mortuary , a country schoolteacher . In 1913 he managed to enter the night classes of the Chicago Art Institute . <P> Year later the straits of his family called him back to Cedar Rapids where , in a 10-by-16-ft. shack built with his own hands , they weathered a winter of near starvation . For seven years , following a spell as a soldier in World War I , he taught art in Iowa public schools , saving his pennies for a trip to Paris , where all U.S. artists thought they had to go . <P> Grant Wood got to Paris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the famed Julian Academy , dressed with Bohemian flamboyance , grew a crop of pink whiskers , painted scores of ordinary , dreamy , old-world impressionist landscapes . But his heart was not in it . He finally decided : " All the really good ideas I ever had came to me while I was milking a cow . " He went back to his native Iowa , to paint the country and the people he knew . But it was not in Iowa , but back in Europe again , that he discovered the style that finally made him famous . <P> In 1928 the American Legion commissioned him to design a stained-glass window for the Cedar Rapids Memorial Coliseum . He went to Munich . There , in the work of 15th-and 16th-Century Flemish and German primitives in the Munich museums , he found at last the infinitely scrupulous , polished and detailed kind of painting he had always wanted to do . He returned to Cedar Rapids with a new way of looking at things , started to paint Iowa with the meticulous care of a Memling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhibited at the Chicago Art Institute , created a furor , and Painter Wood 's reputation was made . <P> lowans at first felt insulted by American Gothic , ended by being proud of it . Younger Midwest artists greeted Wood as an emancipator . Wood himself was able to move from his humble residence at the back of a Cedar Rapids funeral parlor to a fine old red-brick house in Iowa City .
