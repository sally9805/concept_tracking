As Vancouver 's new-broom mayor , rambunctious Gerry McGeer had started his sweeping by firing 23 policemen for letting gambling dens and brothels run wide open . Last week , as chairman of the city 's Police Commission , he sat in judgment on their appeals . Vancouverites were shaken by the unorthodox McGeer way of running a hearing : he paid no attention to traditional rules of evidence banning hearsay , opinion or conjecture . But they were fascinated by the dirt this method dredged up , particularly from a stocky gambler named Louis Tisman . <P> Tisman sounded exactly like an irate taxpayer . He told how he had run poker and dice games in Vancouver since 1937 . To do so , he had paid off Vancouver police in chocolates , whiskey , racehorse tickets and cash up to $250 a month . <P> " For that kind of money , " he complained blandly , " we were n't getting the kind of protection we were paying for . " <P> What really made Tisman sore was that the police discriminated against him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small fry , which was " like raiding a bank and arresting the janitor . " But they had closed him up tight a few times and caused him to lose a lot of business . His-brother Harry Tisman gravely corroborated this . " You had to pay to stay in business , " he said . " It was just like the B.C. Electric-you had to pay your bill or you were cut off . "
