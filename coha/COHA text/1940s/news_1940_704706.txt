txt BRIDGES TOLD NLRB HIS WISHES IN CASE , SMITH DATA SHOW Letters Given to House Inquiry Say Board Member ' Agreed ' on Need for ' Right Man ' HAWAII MATTER INVOLVED C. I. 0 . Coast Leader Attacked Work of One Examiner , the Correspondence Reveals By LOUIS STARK Special to rHE NEW Toax TIMER . WASHINGTON , May ** S. Smith , member of the National Labor Relations Board , advised by Harry Bridges , president of the C. I. 0 . ' s International Longshoremen 's and Warehousemen 's Union , as to the type of lawyer to send to Hawaii for a hearing involving the longshore union , agreed on " the importance of having the right sort " of man for that job , according to correspondence read today into the record of the Smith House committee , investigating the Labor Board . Mr. Bridges not only severely criticized one Labor Board examiner who had been to Hawaii while commending a board attorney who had made an investigation in that area , but he strongly opposed the sending of the regional attorney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francisco office of the Labor Board , according to the correspondence . Testimony at today 's hearing did not develop the identity of the lawyer who had been sent to Hawaii to handle the case . It was stated later at the Labor Board , however , that neither Mr. Edises nor E. K. Eagen , whom Mr. Bridges approved for the task , had been sent . Wanted Attorney Kept on Coast The longshoremen 's chief , writing as regional director of the C. I. 0. , strongly desired , according to his letter to Mr. Smith , to retain the regional attorney on the West Coast as he ( Mr. Bridges ) was satisfied with his work there , although he did not doubt that this man would be " the ideal person " for the Hawaii assignment . Concluding his letter , Mr. Bridges said that his attorneys " have been communicating with Lee Pressman ( 0 . I. 0 . general counsel ) along the same lines , although I am not aware at this time if Lee has discussed the whole matter with you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Personal and Confidential , " was dated Jan. 8 , 1938 , and Mr. Smith 's reply was dated Jan. 11 , 1938 . A week after Mr. Smith sent off his letter he wired to Mr. Edises , whose work on the West Coast Mr. Bridges had praised , as follows : " Please have Harry Bridges telephone me from your office or somewhere else , our expense , tomorrow , Tuesday , between 2:30 and 5:30 , Eastern standard time . " Pressed by Edmund Toland , Smith committee counsel , to explain why he had wished to have the C. I. 0 . leader call him at government expense , Mr. Smith replied that he had wished to give the union leader notice of a hearing on the East Coast seamen 's union case so that he could appear or be represented by a designate . Pressed for Phone Call Data This did not satisfy Mr. Toland , who wanted to know whether labor leaders of all groups and other interested parties had not been notified in the usual course . Then Mr. Smith testified that " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. Toland inquired further of the witness whether , inasmuch as the usual notices had been sent out , Mr. Bridges had not already received the information which was the basis of his telegram to Mr. Edises . At this point Mr. Smith replied that he had no recollection of when the notices had been sent out and that his " clearest recollection " of the telephone incident was that he had wished to give Mr. Bridges " personal , timely notice that there was to be a hearing within a few days . " He remarked that , " incidentally , " he did not know if the telephone call had ever been completed . Mr. Smith also gave as a reason for having wired Mr. Edises to have Mr. Bridges telephone him the fact that " I did not know how to reach Mr. Bridges by telephone . " " I did not have his home or office telephone number , " Mr. Smith went Dn , " therefore the best way I could get in touch with him was to ask Mr. Edises to ask him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place else , " Mr. Toland Dommented . The board 's field examiner whose work in Hawaii Mr. Bridges did not *prove was named as Anders Larsen , whose " whole stay in the isands , " Mr. Bridges wrote Mr. Smith , " accomplished little or nothng for the workers there . " Mr. Bridges added , according to the letter : " The question now is this : Honolulu and Hawaii is in need of a good man who will he able to resist the employers ' argument much better than Mr. Larsen and no doubt Mr. Edises will be the ideal person . However , on the other hand , there appears to be a lot of dissatisfaction with the local board as it is here in San Francisco area and to take Mr. Edises away from the local board would also create a bad situation . " Informing Mr. Smith that the C. I. 0 . unions around San Francisco were dissatisfied with the local Regional Board because of " unnecessary red tape and apparent differences on the board itself , " Mr. Bridges then continued : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others who are somewhat acquainted with the entire matter , possibly forces are at work on the local Regional Board who would be very glad to see Mr. Edises go to Honolulu and have the Regional Board run smoothly , although possibly not to the very great advantage of the unions and the workers . " I am therefore passing this information on to you to acquaint you with our opinion here and at the same time what we think might best be done in the matter . We definitely would deem it a loss if Mr. Edises did not remain with the local board . " It is evident from all accounts that Mr. Larsen did not do a very satisfactory job there . At the same time , because of the employers ' iron control over the whole situation in the islands , it needs a strong man and one who is not susceptible or easily swayed by the arguments , intimidation , etc. ; and I hope you will do what you can to see that somebody of the type of Mr. Eagen or Mr. Edises can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerning Mr. Pressman , C. I. 0 . counsel . In his reply , according to the correspondence , Mr. Smith said : " I agree with you as to the importance of having the right sort of man in Hawaii , and the board has this very much in mind . We had intended to send Edises to Hawaii to hear the pending case of the Plantation Owners Association , not to keep him there , and we have not sent him , simply because of pressure of matters around San Francisco . The problem Is not an easy one to solve . " Mr. Smith said that he was " sorry " regarding the C. I. 0 . dissatisfaction with the San Francisco board office and " had hoped that the personal differences which seemed to have arisen there had been straightened out . " " If you ever get to Washington , I shall be glad to talk these matters with you , " the letter concluded . From a letter by Mr. Smith to Mr. Eagen , now attached to the Seattle office of the Labor Board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his 1937 visit to Hawaii which had evoked considerable commendation . It is expected that this report will be introduced later in the hearings . After informing Mr. Eagen that his report " may have far-reaching consequences , " Mr. Smith added : " As the workers in the East become conscious of rights which are their due , the whole aspect of national and international affairs in the Orient should take a turn for the better . The stones you have thrown into the pool at Hawaii may cause ripples that will reach to very distant places . Your indications of reactions that have already taken place in the Philippines , Australia and New Zealand are certainly exciting to read about . " Mr. Smith advised the board attorney to dictate " a comprehensive report " on his Hawaii observations because " not only will this be valuable for the board 's information but I know two or three persons in Washington before whom I would like to place it , confidentially , of course , and I think considerable good could be accomplished . " Correspondence was read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " secret " reopening of the case of the Times Publishing Company , publishers of the Detroit Times , after a trial examiner had found the company guilty of violating the Labor Act . Secrecy was denied by Louis Newman , the review attorney on the case , who was on the stand . From the correspondence it was disclosed that Nathan Witt , NLRB secretary , sent instructions to Frank H. Bowen , Detroit Regional Director , to reopen the case without having consulted the Detroit office . Later the trial examiner was reversed and the case was dismissed . In a nine-page letter to Mr. Witt , Harold A. Cranefield , Detroit regional attorney , castigated the board for reopening the case on its own motion although it had denied such a motion when made by the company which had asked for further hearing for a specific purpose , according to the correspondence . " Thus we have the picture of the board refusing to reopen for a properly specifed and limited purpose and later , without any explanation , on its own motion , reopening without limitation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embarrassing feature of this procedure is your private communication advising us of four specific points on which additional evidence is desired . Apparently no copies of this memorandum went to the parties and it is not a limitation of the order . Counsel for respondent and for the union have both inquired as to what subjects are to be developed on the reopened hearing . " We have had the choice of ( 1 ) falsely stating that we do n't know , ( 2 ) admitting that we are in on the board 's secret and will let them in on it in due course , i. e. , when the hearing is convened , or ( 3 ) evading . Thus far we have managed to adhere to the third course . "
