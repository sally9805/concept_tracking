Last week a dove of peace shuttled hopefully between the Israeli and Arab capitals . It was a white Dakota plane , with red crosses painted on the wings and body . The wings also bore , in bold , black letters , the words " United Nations " in English and French . The plane 's principal passenger was 53-year-old Count Folke Bernadotte of Sweden , president of the Swedish Red Cross and U.N . mediator for Palestine . His mission was to win Jewish and Arab acceptance of a cease-fire agreement . <P> Bernadotte had transmitted some of his courtly manners to the plane ; when he left Athens , he told the Dutch crew to buzz the royal palace and dip the wings in salute to Queen Frederika . He had brought clothes for every occasion ; in Cairo he wore a white tropical suit , in Tel Aviv a grey bemedaled uniform . He also brought considerable Red Cross experience as an intermediary between belligerents . In World War II he had arranged an exchange of disabled German and British prisoners of war , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Danish hostages to Sweden . <P> Bernadotte would need all his diplomatic skill . Israel and the Arab governments said that they had " unconditionally " accepted the Security Council 's call for a four-week truce . But there were conditions to the unconditional : the Israelis had attached " assumptions , " the Arabs " explanations . " One of the chief obstacles to agreement was the question of immigration . Jews insisted that the Security Council resolution allowed unlimited immigration , even of men of military age . The Arabs claimed that Jewish immigrants were potential soldiers and should be barred during the truce period . By week 's end Bernadotte said that this quarrel was " alone obstructing agreement . " He submitted a confidential truce proposal to Tel Aviv and the Arab capitals . <P> Both sides were still talking belligerently and boasting of famous victories-by-communiqu . The sober facts were that fighting so far had been on a small scale , * that ( except for Arab raids into Galilee ) all of it had taken place outside Israel 's borders as fixed by U.N. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Palestine , that the Egyptians were hard-pressed south of Tel Aviv , and that the Jews had not been able to open the road to Jerusalem . Mediator Bernadotte might be helped by the fact that both Jews and Arabs seemed reluctant to throw their full strength into the fight . " Being by nature an optimist , " said Bernadotte , " I have n't become a pessimist . " <P> <P> * Outside Tel Aviv harbor last week , in the war 's first naval engagement , an Israeli corvette and planes gave battle to an Egyptian corvette and some small transports . The Egyptian force withdrew .
