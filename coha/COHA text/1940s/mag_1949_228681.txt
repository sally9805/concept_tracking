Dean Liston Pope of Yale Divinity School believes strongly in the " study of society as it is in relation to what it ought to be . " This spring and summer , slim , spectacled Liston Pope ( TIME , Jan. 24 ) made a study in Africa , under the auspices of the Phelps-Stokes Fund and the Julius Rosenwald Fund . Last week he delivered a somber report of what he saw on his 25,000-mile air tour . <P> A Vague Appeal . In Liberia , British West Africa , the Belgian Congo , the Union of South Africa and the Rhodesias , Dean Pope conferred with 125 native leaders , as well as missionaries and government officials . " As a whole , " he said , " the African leaders are as embittered , confused and without hope as any group of men on earth ... Grievances vary , but there is almost universal bitterness against white men-a small minority in every country who have arrogated to themselves all the most important political prerogatives , economic resources and cultural opportunities . " The leaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement has little influence- " though among the native peoples there is a vague appeal in the use of the word as a symbol of racial equality . " <P> Under Africa 's threatening skies , Pope sees the Christian missions as facing many critical decisions . Foremost is the question of the schools . " The situation in Southern Rhodesia illustrates it . There the government pays most of the bill of those Protestant and Catholic mission schools which meet government standards , instead of providing universal free education . Under this system , about a third of the children are in school . If the missions turn education.over to the government , it would have to be provided for everyone , and it would cost three times as much . But the missionaries are worried about doing this because they know that most new church members now come from the schools , rather than the oldtime evangelism . And they are also well aware of the dangers of secularization and government propaganda if they turn their schools over to the state . " <P> New Missionary . Pope concluded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missions on the road to equality . " In fact , they often look upon the missions as in the camp of the opposition , due to the white control of the mission program and arrangements whereby governments support mission schools . " <P> A new kind of missionary is needed in Africa today , according to Dr. Pope . " The oldtime missionary sat down in a hut with a dozen natives . Today the missionary has largely become the chief of staff of an institution doing work much of which could be and should be done by government agencies . Perhaps missionaries need to get back to the day-to-day life of the African again ... The new kind of missionary Africa needs is a moral and spiritual technician who will not preach the Gospel vaguely , but relate Christian philosophy to the needs and aspirations of the people where they are .
