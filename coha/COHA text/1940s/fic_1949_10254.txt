red legend warned everyone above the dealer 's head . Strung from that same taut wire that held the poolroom marker , it would waver a bit and darken as the smoke grew heavier . On the other side of the marker hung a meaningless little green invitation as dated as last year 's calendar : SHORT CARDS60c per hourNo one had played short cards here since Pearl Harbor . Schwiefka , and Schwiefka 's shills , killed the hours before the suckers ' hours with call-rummy and no-peek between themselves while listening to each other 's boasts and complaints . " I went to five taverns ' n a guy bought me a drink in every one , " Sparrow reported with real pride . " The same guy ? " Frankie asked , riffling the deck . " Differ'nt guys , " Sparrow explained indulgently . " Now I ai n't even got for a bottle wine  --  ' n you sayin ' I ai n't really broke . " " You 're always broke , " Nifty Louie observed , " I think when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " If yours 'd ever had a steady job you never would of been borned at all , " Sparrow retorted . " Trouble with both you guys is you spend your dough on foolish things , " Frankie counseled them both in all seriousness and Louie , who had followed Frankie in tonight , asked too casually , " What you spend yours on , Dealer ? " Frankie dealt around for reply , skipping Sparrow , who professed to be too broke to play . When Drunkie John came up with an unlabeled half pint off the hip and offered it to the punk for consolation , Sparrow eyed it sadly and mourned , " Boy oh boy , the bottle wit'out a name . " In a tone so melancholy it sounded like , " Boy oh boy , the Christ wit'out a cross . " Drank without pleasure , handed it back to Drunkie John and sat back unhappily . " Borrow me a dirty sawbuck , I wan na play too , " he asked the players on either side of him , twice each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dealer 's eyeshade , " Never play against my own money . " " Then borrow me a dirty deuce . " Sparrow was always careful to identify any money he was able to borrow as dirty , suspecting that he thus reduced the obligation slightly . It troubled him to see the cards going around , skipping only himself.  |p101Yet  he did n't like to ask money of Frankie , it seemed like Frankie never had a dime any more . And looked so pale , so pale . " Let me deal , " he begged Frankie , " let me relieve you two bucks wort '  --  go pertend you got a date wit ' a movie actress ' n do n't come back till the marks start knockin ' . " The dealer made no reply and did n't look as though he cared one way or another . If Schwiefka wanted to let the punk fool around for half an hour it was all right with Frankie . But Schwiefka paid no heed and Sparrow waited miserably . " Well , should I start washin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know after a minute . " Yell , " Schweifka deigned to answer at last . " ' N wash yer face too . " " Let him deal , " Nifty Louie urged , " he ca n't steal no more than Machine . " Nifty Louie 's roll carried weight with Schwiefka . He shrugged uncertainly . Sparrow nudged Frankie out of the slot and the players tossed in a nickel ante each . " Look at the Jewish deal , " Louie marveled , for the punk dealt lefthanded . Sparrow dealt swiftly , sometimes with the right hand and sometimes with the left , sometimes beginning with the player to his right and the next time to his left , it was all one to Sparrow . But all the while watchingthat pot like a mangy chicken hawk . There was four ' dollars and twenty cents in it for the winner  --  the player he 'd just asked for the loan of a two-spot . The punk knew when he had a good thing . He shoved seventy-five cents of the four-twenty to the winner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bag and got the rest in his own shirt pocket all in a single scoop of those ragged little claws . The winner looked down in cold horror : he 'd spent over two dollars to win a four-dollar pot and had six bits of it in front of him . " Back off if you do n't like how we deal here , " Sparrow anticipated his protest . " Should I deal you out ? " The others cheered wildly , they had n't lost a dime on the deal . " Ataboy , Sparrow , you 're in the driver 's seat now . " Theydid n't cheer for long . The next pot held three dollars , of which the dealer got a dollar-forty for his trouble , the house earned thirty rents and the winner the crumbs . Oddly , there were n't many players for the next hand . Only forty-five cents lay in the kitty and Sparrow got two bits of that before Schwiefkap102had him by the neck . Before the punk could squawk so much as once he was sitting on the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only this time with nearly five dollars before him and there would n't be any getting him out of the game till it was gone . " I 'm supposed to be dead in 1921 , " Louie began confiding in Drunkie John . " Here it is almost ' 47 ' n I 'm still pumpin ' water . " Louie could never quite get over his feat of having pumped water so long . " The guys who were lookin ' for me in the old days ' r gone : dead ' r drunk ' r dyin ' . Them was the ones rubbed garlic on the shells  --  I 'm suppose to have a garlic slug in my head twenny-six years ' n all I got was a toenail yanked off with a red-hot pintsers . " Under the light , perspirationhad dried the violet talc into the corners of his lips and the lips barely moved when he spoke . " Doin ' time ' r lushin ' , dead ' r drunk ' r dyin ' . " " I remember Frank the Enforcer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he was the kind who 'd blow half a hundred over the bar but would n't spend for a pack cigarettes . He 'd smoke yours . " And drank . From the bottle without a name . " Them was the good old days , when a guy got thirteen years for a misdemeanor . When you done somethin ' then you paid for it , " he mourned . " It ai n't like now . It 's too cheap now . " The marks of debauchery were seamed across his face like a chronic disease . The only one here who seemed to have no memories of torture , murder and grand larceny was Umbrella Man , who walked about the streets smiling gently , day after day , tinkling an old-fashioned school bell and bearing a battered umbrella strapped to his back . He could not look on violence without panic , so it was always told of him with surprise : " That fool with the umbrellas  --  you know who he is ? He 's the brother by the smartest cop on the street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? He 's everybody 's cousin  --  for a double saw that is . He 's over there shakin ' down the greenhorns ' n the biggest greener on his beat is his own brother . The mutt is suppose to fix umbrellas but he ai n't gon na fix mine . He do n't act like he could heat water for a scab barber . " Beside Umbrellas , the one called Meter Reader had once played sandlot baseball and now coached his employers ' team , the Endless Belt &; Leather Invincibles , an aggregation that had n't won a game since Meter Reader had taken it over . " Next time you come up here after raidin ' the five-'n-ten I 'm gonnap103turn you in to Record Head myself , " Louie warned Sparrow just to start the evening rolling . " The day you turn him in I 'll have you deported , " Frankie put in quietly . " The dealer has got hold of hisself real fine , " Louie thought just as softly . " You ca n't do that to him , Frankie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a country . " Yet no one had to be a Pinkerton to tell that Sparrow had been raidingthe five-and-ten again . He was wearing half a dozen **27;4344;TOOLONG pencils , each containing a tiny battery and having a tiny bulb at the point commonly occupied by an eraser . He had seen the one Sophie toyed with and had decided he needed a handful of them himself . " What the hell good is a pencil with a flashlight on it ? " Louie wanted to know . As Frankie 's grip on himself tightened Louie felt increasingly restless . " They 're good for writin ' in blackouts , brother , " the punk explained . " You hit him from this side , I 'll hit him from this , " Louie exclaimed in disgust at Sparrow 's argument . " The war 's over  --  ' n do n't call me ' brother . ' " " Still , they 're good on dark nights to save ' lectricity , " Sparrow persisted . " You could write all night ' n it 's easier on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the punk , received one of the pencils and warned him , " You got to replace the battery when it burns out , for free . " " For a quarter ? " Sparrow was indignant . " Do n't you figure I got labor costs ? Replacements is free just wit ' the fifty-cent deal . You want another one ' n get free batt'ries the rest of yer life ? " " When the battery wears out you 'll replace it  --  or eat the pencil , " he advised Sparrow matter-of-factly . " How can I refill it if the five-'n-dime puts somethin ' else on the batt'ry counter ? " Sparrow pleaded . " Do n't ask me how to run your business . This thing is guaranteed for life so far as I 'm concerned . " " Here 's yer two bits back , " Sparrow offered to return the coin . " Keep your money , Solly , " Frankie suggested , " if that battery lasts three days it 'll prob'ly outlive Louie . " As though secretly convinced of Frankie 's prophecy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his very own life being held , just out of reach , in a stranger 's hand . Sparrowp104thrust it deep into his watch pocket . " I just realized how right Dealer could be , " he told Louie , and saw the pallor of Louie 's flesh under the violet talc . " You look like if the batt'ry lasts the night it 's a lifetime guarantee in yer case . " " I 'll die like Machine deals , " Louie conceded , abandoning the argumentin a surge of weariness  --  last . " " It 's how you 've lived , " Schwiefka told him . " It 's how we 've all lived , " Drunkie John reminded them all , speaking as if it were over and done with for everyone . Everyone 's chickens would be coming home to roost soon enough , John felt . Sparrow , studying Louie 's ravaged face in the greenish light , suddenlyrelented . " I 'll refill it any time it goes dead , even if I have to sneak in the warehouse to do it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark you 'll end up on a slab before he will , " Frankie put in nervously . But Sparrow shook off the warning . " I 'm a businessman , " the punk explained with dignity . " I filfull my obligations even if I have to rob a warehouse to do it . You think I want my credit to lakse ? That 's the difference between a businessman like me ' n a cheap hustler like you  --  you hustlers got no credit . " Frankie shuffled the deck slowly , staffing in the hope that the suckers might start knocking to get the night over and ( lone and forgotten . " That 's the trouble with the whole country , all you businessmen cheatin ' the peoples so fast ' n hard there 's nothin ' left for an honest hustler to steal . " " I 'll tell you what I think for true , " Sparrow offered seriously , " I do n't think there 's any difference : a businessman is a hustler with the dough to hustle on the legit ' n @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or never had it . Back me up with five grand tonight ' n tomorrowmornin ' I get a invitation to join the Chamber of Commerce ' n no questions asked . " " Record Head 'll get you first , " Louie repeated his warning to Sparrow . " Yeh , " everyone agreed at once , their spirits improved by the punk 's prospects for a long-term jacket , " by the time he gets out Kvorka 's kid 'll be wearin ' the old man 's badge . " " It 's too cheap now , " John renewed his ancient complaint , " when you done somethin ' in the old days you paid for it . " " The hell with the old days , " Sparrow protested , looking resentfully at John . " I hope your batt'ry goes dead too . "  | " His battery 's been dead for twenty years , " Frankie had to put in . " That 's all right , " John pointed out , " the batt'ry may be dead but the brain is still workin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leakin ' ? Look at this punk  --  his tubes is boilin ' over but his connections is spillin ' like a secondhand Essex . " " I 'm still on the legit , " Sparrow answered without glancing at Louie , " compared to some people anyhow . There ai n't no joy-poppers waitin ' for me down by the Safari . " It was the first time Frankie realized that the punk was on to Louie 's racket and he felt an unreasoning resentment of that knowledge . How much did the punk know ? It must be just some word he 'd overheard and was tossing around with no real knowledge of the accusation he was making , Frankie decided uneasily . Sparrow had pressed the game too far . With the ace of clubs in his hand Louie asked , " You want to die in an alley ? " With all the jesting gone out of his voice . Sparrow did n't have the courage to defy Louie when Louie talked business  --  but he had an ace in the hole himself . He could throw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , broken in some childhoodantic , bending it into a series of unnatural ridges which he could point at an opponent silently , thus avenging himself without risking provocative language . " I 'll make the juju sign on you , " he threatened Louie softly , and Louie overheard . " You point that freakin ' finger at me ' n you 're one ( lead pointer . " It was a challenge . Everyone had seen him challenged . So the momentLouie 's eyes returned to his cards Sparrow pointed , swiftly and damningly  --  Louie heard the knuckles crack . Somebody laughed and Frankie felt his innards tighten with this night 's first intimation that Cod 's medicine might not choose to hold him together till morning . " Was you pointin ' that freakin ' finger at me ? " Louie just had to know . " I do n't point nobody but enemies , " Sparrow appeased him hurriedly , " ' n you ' n me ' r old buddies . " And went lightly into some little nostalgic tune or other of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big department store . " " The telephone 's goin ' to ring , " Blind Pig suddenly shushed everybody , and before he 'd finished his warning it rang . A trick which , likep106his other rare assets , did n't mean much . Yet not even the punk could outguess a telephone . " Specially a phone wit'out a number , " Pig boasted as if the fact that the phone had a blind number somehow made the trick tougher . Its number was known only to the one who called , at the same hour , every Saturday night . Schwiefka would answer and his voice , slavish and greasy , had the politeness he reserved only for women of means . " Hold on good , " he would be heard saying eagerly , " I 'll call him . " Louie would take the phone while Schwiefka returned to his seat beside Frankie . " You look like a cat eatin ' hot horse manure on a frosty morning , " Frankie would tell him then . " I oney wisht I could get on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone is gon na ring , " Pig lamented . " I hear it comin ' over the wires . I hear things before a dog could hear ' em . " The allusion to a dog returned Frankie 's mind to the room where the hound cowered beneath the dresser , waiting for his return . Rumdum had feared Sophie from the first . And after Louie 's return to the table all things began weighing namelesslyupon the dealer till even the deck seemed heavy in his hand . For one moment that nerveless wrist trembled , then steadied for the rest of the night . Yet in that brief trembling Frankie knew what was wrong . He had n't expected to need another fix this soon . As the cards went around and around , as if being dealt out of a machine , he saw again the narrow , uncarpeted stair that climbed two flights to a single room where a scarred practice board stood jammed under a sink full of dirty dishes and an older deck lay on the shelf above ; the shelf that never got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Still , whenever I leave a bottle up there , there 's always a couple good nips gone out of it , " he mused . " She can reach up high enough to get a bottle but not high enough to clean the shelf it 's standin ' on . She must use the pillow . " " Look at the mope  --  he 's dreamin ' he 's marryin ' a movie actress , " Schwiefka said , and tossed the green silk bag to the dealer . The fun was over for the evening . Now the suckers would start dropping in , look absently at the dayoldRacing Forms for a minute pretending they 'd just dropped in to get the results ; then each would sit in for " just half an hour , to kill the time  --  this is the night I take the old lady out steppin ' . " It was a commonp107device , calculated to leave an opening by which one might , in event of unusual early luck , go south gracefully with a small , but tidy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was forgotten , the bets were up to a dollar and two , the cut was five per cent up to fifteen dollars and at the door Sparrow was letting the first live ones in . The five per cent went into the green silk bag and when one of the winners tossed the dealer a quarter for himself , Frankie rang it on the metal shade of the light above his head to indicate  --  whether Schwiefka was there to see or not  --  that it was his and not the house 's . If the punk was dubious of some stranger 's face he opened the door only wide enough to say , " Nothin ' like that goin ' on in here , Mister . This is Endless Belt ' n Leat'er Specialties  --  you want to buy a endless belt ? " Thus to the man who sometimes called himself a " traveling dealer , " whom others called Frankie Machine , life was pretty much of an allnightstud session . With himself in the dealer 's slot and Zero Schwiefka getting the take . Steps on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's a sucker , I can tell how he knocks , so light , " Sparrow said , rising to let the mark in . The only time Frankie saw Drunkie John of late was at Schwiefka 's table . For the Jailer had gotten rid of him at last and Molly-O lived on alone in the room they once had shared . Dark-haired Molly 's little nest lay in the darkness of the first floor front , its only window opening out onto the unpaved tunnel below the cross-steeled El . Yet she kept the window 's single curtain fresh , to hang as white and limply as a curtain overlooking a country lawn . It never hung limply for long . When the Loopbound express was still a quarter of a mile away the curtain would stir uneasily with the rumor of its approach , flutter and billow tensely while the room shook a little and then a little more till the curtain bulged out in a rigid and frenzied whiteness , straining and beating furiously at the sill as the cars hurtled overhead ; to flutter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had left her for his first and truest love : the bottle without a name . He would return when the bottle went dry , and if he came when the Jailer was n't by to protect her she would give him a dollar or two . She drew a percentage of every forty-cent drink she hustled , there were nights when she made as much as ten dollars ; and nights when she wound up without a dime and owing the house five dollars to boot.  | " I 'd be cheaper off livin ' somewheres where you could n't find me , " she had complained to John the last time he 'd called . " I 'd find you all the same , " he 'd assured her . She was happy to be rid of him at any cost . Now in the mornings she would waken , her head on the small red pillow , to see the curtain 's whiteness veiling the room . Behind it the dresser would seem strangely unreal , as it might appear to a waking infant : veiled by light flowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in waking without John beside her ; a contentment forever tinged by dread of his return . Two lamps stood on the dresser , one with a red bulb and one with a blue . Between them , for some reason , a magazine cover had been thumbtacked to the wall bearing the momentous query : Is Jazz Going Hibrow ? The blue bulb burned , the red bulb burned : the curtain stirred and slow steps passed . It did n't look like much of a Christmas in dark-haired Molly 's nest . Nor any season for merrymaking in Frankie Machine 's heart . On the night following the great dish-breaking on the second floor front he stood outside her door looking quietly down at Humdum 's equally quiet mug . About the dog 's throat Sparrow had tied a blue ribbon bearing a red , heart-shaped tag with the simplest sort of appeal : Have a Heart . " I 'll take him here , " Frankie told the punk . " Zosh is sleepin ' . I 'll see you at the joint around ten . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sparrow explained , moving toward the stairs , " Stash is hittin ' the hay early these nights . " Without turning his head Frankie said , " Do n't knock on my door . Zosh is sleepin ' too . " " You told me that twice awready , " Sparrow reminded Frankie . " She can sleep all night if she wants , I got nuttin ' to bother your Zosh about . " He sensed that Frankie was trying to tell himn that no one had seen Frankie outside the door of the first floor front . What kind of bull was Frankie feeding Zosh now that she was n't even supposed to know he was in the building ? " Frankie 's in the switches , " the punk brooded , " it 's like he wants to run somewheres ' n ca n't make up his mind which way to head . " As he passed the second flight he heard Sophie wheeling across the room . If it was just a matter of giving that Molly Novotny a play , Frankie ought to know by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away yet . " You 'd think it was a big deal , tryin ' to make a chick , the way he 's goin ' about it , " Sparrow decided with something of scorn ; he 'd always been a swifter and surer operator with women than Frankie . Frankie waited till he heard Sparrow 's steps fade out on the third floor , then touched the bottle on his hip and knocked lightly at the first floor front . He had to knock twice , he knocked so lightly , before she replied . And managed to look just a little surprised when she did . " You knocked so light , " she told him , and through his mind went Sparrow 's warning : " It sounds like a sucker , he knocks so light . " " I was n't sure it was anybody . " She looked from the tired-looking man to the demented-looking hound . This time she was protected against the light , standing in her fresh white dress and the little bloodredearrings against the sallow olive of her cheeks and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down over her shoulders as if touched by the wind that drove the curtains aside when the long Els stormed overhead . She was looking less careworn since John had left her . " I just thought you 'd like to see a dog that drinks beer , " Frankie apologized , " you told me to get one of my own to kick . " " I did n't say nothin ' about a beer-drinkin ' one , Frankie , " she protestedas gravely as a child . " But if you want we 'll try him out . " Rumdum , at first listening only listlessly , picked up suddenly and hauled Frankie forward into the room . " The smell of Budweiser makes him powerful , " Frankie explained . Before she could get the saucer filled Rumdum had licked the saucer dry and Frankie had to clamp his snout with both hands , the great hound whimpering brokenheartedly , till she could get it filled again without losing a finger . " He ai n't had a drink all day , " Frankie sympathized with all dry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He pulled the bottle off his hip with feigned surprise at finding it there . " Look what some guy stuck in my pocket ! " " I 'll stick to beer , " Molly told him cautiously . " I been on the wagon since John 's gone . " She turned to the little combination record player on the dresser while he drank . " Everythin ' is movin ' too fast , " the record complained drowsily.  | " I got Girlie tied up in the pantry , " Molly reported . " I really do n't have room for her in here but I ca n't find nobody to take her off my hands . " " I know a party might be some help that way , " Frankie offered , while Rumdum 's tongue lolled at the half-empty bottle on the table . Molly poured him another saucer and herself a glass  --  before the foam had settled he was lolling up at her for a refill . While from the pantry , muted and miserable , Girlie moaned a melancholy protest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't let her loose , " Frankie counseled Molly . " She might remember me ' n take a bite . " " Slow-ow down Slow-ow down , " the singer counseled both Frankie and Rumdum , " ' Cause everythin ' is movin ' too fast . " " I just bought this one , " Frankie indicated the half-perked ear with the point of his shoe , " to give Zosh somethin ' to do beside stone me . " " I remember Zosh from the old days , Frankie . Remember the time you took me to the dance by St. Wenceslaus ' n she come right across the floor ' n slapped me a good one , right in front of everybody  --  you was n't supposed to go dancin ' with nobody but Zosh ? ' N look at her now . Such a shame . " But could n't keep the small note of triumph out of her tone . Frankie did n't have to have Molly Novotny remind him that Zosh did n't talk to just anybody in those years . " She 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and picked up some song or other in her hoarse , wise , taunting voice , letting her eyes remember the one night they had danced together . " This is a great big city , There 's a million things to see , But the one I love is missing . Ai n't no town big enough for me . " Rumdum barked weakly , more like a dream than a dog , scratched himself feebly and folded up onto his forepaws to sleep the sleep of the just . " A dog should have fleas once in a while , " Molly told Frankie seriously . " He ai n't a real dog if he do n't . I do n't know why . "  | " Them little fox terrors is good , " Frankie informed her . " Out West they carry them on a saddle ' n when they see the fox the little terror leads all the other hounds to it . " Rumdum 's paws waggled in sleep . He was a dream terrier running down a dream fox , leading all the other hounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merry-go-round steed , loping with infinite mechanical ease to some old merry-go-round tune and the dog scrambled , slipping and falling and barking , upon its terrible hooves ; all down the weary merry-go-round of old-dog dreams . " Dogs dream too , " Molly added , from some authentic source she did not care to reveal , " they dream they 're doin ' what they like to do best . Just like people . " " That one do n't , " Frankie assured her , " or he 'd be dreamin ' he was drownin ' in a beer barrel ' n wake up yipin ' . " " I do n't sleep good myself  --  I guess I 'm just not used to sleepin ' alone . I dream that John is back ' n wake up . Some nights I ca n't sleep at all , like my vitality is rennin ' away with me . I 'm too high-strung . You know what I am ? " And before he could ask what  --  " Polish , Bohemian ' n Magyar . " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do on rainy days here is play classical music , " she informed him with a primness he thought she had long lost . " I try to stay out of the whisky taverns now that John 's gone . You like classical music ? " " No . " " I do . Sometimes I hear a new word . Then I find a word to rhyme with it ' n make up classical music to go with it . You read books ? " " No . " " I do . Sex books . Intellectual sex books like that Strange Woman . She has this guy , that 's the sex . Then they get married , so that makes it in-tellectual . " Since he had nothing to add to that , and still did n't reach for her or move , she fell into one of her little singsong taunts : " Let me be your little sweetheart , I 'll be much obliged to you . " Then , with a gesture Frankie never forgot , touched two fingertips lightly to her tongue , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how the girls do at the Safari , " she apologized  --  and actually blushed . " But all I do is get the suckers to drink . "  | " If people dream what they want to dream "  --  he came awake at last  --  " then I 'll dream I 'm gettin ' a new girl on the first floor front  --  I think you 're a nice girl , Molly-O . " " I know , " she acknowledged readily , " I 'm a real nice girl . ' N the bathroom'sto the right . " " I mean it , Molly-O . You got the good kind of heart , the kind that melts a guy . " She studied him to see just what made him tick . Something had gone wrong with him , she sensed without being able to put a finger on it while her eyes moved from the shaggy tousle of his hair to the battered army brogans . " You do n't keep yourself sharp like you used to , " she decided . " When you gon na @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleeve that had been ripped in the accident , Sophie had n't yet gotten around to patching it . Some days it was hooked together with a safety pin and some days was n't hooked at all . " I remember you when your pants was so sharp they was jealous of your shoes , " she teased him in a voice ready to break into laughter or tears without knowing which it wanted most to do . He came to her . " Yeh . ' N I remember you when you had that profile that went all the way down . " " I do get lonely , " she had to confess then , and her voice broke on his name . " Frankie . " A quarter of a mile away the Loopbound El sent the curtain stirring and as the cars clattered overhead it bloomed , passionately and white . Then slowly fell and went limp . With his face buried between her breasts he heard the city beyond the window stir like a sleeper with the first rumors of evening . When evening came taxiing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still slept , and sewed his sleeve with love . " I 'm patchin ' his heart , " she told herself quietly . She did n't sew well . By the time she was through , and pleased with her handiwork , it still looked as if it were hooked with a pin . She had been loved , before the world went wrong , and now was loved again . All through that night , long after he had left for work , she remembered how he had been before and how he was now . And a tenderness mixed of pity and love shook her like the wind off the tracks at midnight . Till tenderness turned into sleep ; as night turned into morning . Later on that Sunday forenoon Frankie lay again on his own bed up on the second floor front trying to believe that , if there had been no warp113at all , if he had n't volunteered , if there had been no accident , if there had n't been this and there had n't been that , then everything would certainly have turned out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Mass  --  if he could only believe that going to Mass might help undo what he had done he might even go himself . If only it might make a little bit of the might-have-been still come true perhaps it would be worth while to go sometime again . Maybe if he went along some Sunday , suddenly right there by the altar rail Sophie would get up on her feet and tell him , " Nobody 'll have to wheel me here no more , Frankie . Let 's go dancin ' by Guyman 's Paradise t'night . " But Sunday morning was always pretty rugged for anything but sleep . All the miracles were performed on Saturday night , it seemed . Down on the first floor front . " I 'll say one Hail Mary , one Our Father , ' n one Act of Contrition , " he compromised with himself , " just as soon as Vi ' n Zosh get back . " So the first thing he did when they returned was to reach for the bottle on the shelf above the bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to sleep . Yet there was a difference now to the dealer 's nights . He had found that , with Molly Novotny 's arms around him , he could resist the sickness and the loneliness that drove him to the room above the Safari . He had confessed the whole business to her , she had half guessed the truth before he had told it . " I could tell somethin ' was wrong the minute you put your head in that door the other evening , Frankie . I said to myself , This guy got somethin ' eatin ' on him , he got that beat look them Safari junkies got . ' Frankie  --  the next time you start gettin ' sick you come to me instead of to Louie . I 'm better for you . And I 'll lock you in here if I have to but I 'll get you off that dirty stuff . " If I just knew you a couple days I would n't care , it would n't be none of my business . But I knew you when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want you to be the best guy again . " He had fought off the sickness four nights running and on the fifth it was no worse than being hungry all night . " I got one of that monkey 's paws off my back , " he bragged to Molly . In the dealer 's slot his old confidence ebbed back a bit , until he could again assure himself , " It 's all in the wrist ' n I got the touch . "  |p114Only  the blurred image of a woman in a wheelchair remained to darken his moods : that was the monkey 's other paw . Each night he slipped singles and fives and deuces into the green silk bag . Frankie dealt the fastest game in the Near Northwest Side when he was right , and he was more right now with every night ; at moments it seemed to him he was faster and steadier than he had ever been . At any second , through all the hours , he knew to a nickel how the pot stood and controlled the players like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they too were at his fingertips once more . For like the deuces and aces they all came home to him toward closingtime . Turned face up at last , their night-long secret bluffing was exposedat last : the fat florid kings , the lean and menacing black jacks and those sneaky little gray deuces , all betrayed the sucker by morning . In the early light Schwiefka , with his fry-cook 's complexion , called " Change it up ! " to the steerer for the last time . And went south with the bundle . There had been only one serious argument at Schwiefka 's while Frankie was in the slot , for Frankie had the knack of anticipating funny business . He sensed the sort of desperation which would tempt a man to slip a single exposed ace around the hole card , flashing it so fast it gave the impression of a pair . It had been that one pulled , for the sake of caution , on the slow-witted umbrella man , in which Frankie had trapped Louie cold . Everyone knew immediately what had happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louie had said " bullets " and reached for the pot . Frankie had flipped Louie 's cards open before the fixer had had time to get them back into the deck . " I swear I seen bullets , " Louie had pretended casually , and nobody told him he lied . But Umbrellas had gotten the pot and Louie had never quite forgiven the dealer for exposing him . " You 'd think it was comin ' out of his own pocket , " he complained later of Frankie . Since that time there came a moment every night , before the first suckers started knocking , when Frankie would look uneasily at Louie and say , " I call the hands . What I say goes . That 's how it 's always been ' n that 's how it 's gon na stay ' n nobody 's gon na change it . " He told Louie that exactly as some sergeant had once told it to him when he 'd questionedan order . It had worked on Private Majcinek . So ex-Private Majcinek assumed it had an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each fresh sucker with a practiced eye . Schwiefka sentp115occasional stooges into the game to keep his dealer straight  --  usually one wearing a loudly flowered tie and sideburns ; with a habit of finding the dealer 's toe under the table to indicate that a bit of co-operation with that deck would n't go unappreciated . Good-time Charlies with the usual whisky glass in the middle of the forehead and that certain farawaylook which never troubled to count a winning pot to see whether it was right . " We trust each other , Dealer , " was the implication of that look . The dealer trusted no man on the other side of the slot . He had outlastedforty such touts . They did n't call him Machine just because he was fast . They called him Machine because he was regular . He could n't risk being anything else ; dealing was the sole skill he owned . " The day I get my musician 's union card is the day I 'll steal Schwiefka blind , " he planned in his tough-skinned larcenous little heart . Until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Widow Wieczorek 's ivory-tipped cues . One by one Schwiefka 's shills would give place , as the winter night wore on , the stakes would grow higher as the air grew heavier and the marks grew lighter ; to be replaced , one by one , like so many sausages into the same sure grinder . While at the door Sparrow urged losers and winners alike : " Tell ' em where you got it ' n how easy it was . " " Till Frankie would sit back wearily , sick of seeing them come on begging to be hustled , wondering where in the world they all came from and how in the world they all earned it and what in the world they told their wives and what , especially , they told themselves and why in the world they always , always , always , always came back for more . " More , more , I keep cryin ' for more more  --  " Some tattered walkathon tune of the early thirties went banging like a one-wheeled Good Humor cart of those same years through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his fingers went lightly dividing change in the middle , taking the house 's percentage without making the winner too sharply aware of the cut . It was one thing for a player to understand he was bucking a percentage and quite another to see it taken before his eyes . To the mark it always seemed , vaguely , that the dealer might have overlooked the cut , just this once , out of sportsmanship . For when the sucker held a hot hand five per cent did n't trouble him  --  he 'd be feeling too smug about having the case acep116concealed while that chump across the board was pitching in his last desperate dollar in the hope of hooking that same ace . And when he was n't involved in the pot the sucker did n't care if the dealer took ninety per cent . It was n't any skin off his hide then , the sucker figured . " I hope I break even tonight , " was the sucker 's philosophy , " I need the money so bad . " And always the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , past familiar yet nameless stops , through the besieged city of the dealer 's brain . " More , more , I keep cryin ' for more more more --  " A tune he 'd heard some afternoon when he and Sophie were first engaged and he 'd liked taking her down Division because she dressed so sharp and had that haughty , hard-to-get stride that had had everyone fooled but himself : he 'd solved it before she 'd had a chance to develop adult defenses . A stride somewhere between a henwalk shuffle and a Cuban grind , one of the boys had once described it . A walk as provocative as a strip teaser zipping down one black glove on the runway just to give the boys an idea of how much there was to zip before taking it all away again . And those silk-sheathed legs as proud-looking as a fawn 's . Once , when both were still in their teens , he 'd ignored Sophie for a month just to show her he did n't care one way or another . Until she 'd asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saturday nights or not . He 'd fished a nickel out of his pocket and slipped it into her palm . " Here 's a nickel , kid . Call me up when you 're eighteen . Right now I got to do some shoppin ' around . " She 'd gone off in such a high-wheeled huff he 'd thought that that was surely the end of that . But two days later she 'd slipped him a note in front of the corner apteka . " I have to talk to you . " But in her own living room there really had n't been anything to talk about after all . She 'd come down off that high horse onto her knees . He 'd brought her down till she 'd never have her full height again . He 'd broken her pride for keeps that afternoon . Now for ten years she had held him in the hope of recovering that lost pride ; till it had grown too late to loosen her grip upon him . If she let go of him now she let go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Frankie thought nostalgically . Whenp117every other door was a tavern and you had as much on the next guy as he had on you . When the worst thing the neighborhood bucks got pinched for was strongarming and no one fooled with anything deadlier than whisky . When there were n't any fixers strolling through the Safari with more dough tied up in a single brown drugstore bottle than in a case of the best bonded scotch behind the bar . And the old days before the old days , when burlesque was still burlesque , Kenny Brenna was the funniest man in town and the streetcarmen got salt out of the box down on Augusta Boulevard to melt the ice in the switches . Down on Augusta where they 'd played the same games other children played in less crowded neighborhoods  --  but bad played them with little vicious twists unknown to luckier stubs . They 'd played Let Her Fly simply by wrapping up garbage from the nearest can and sneaking up on a privately selected opponent with it : one who never knew he was anyone 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeth . For the game 's single rule had been that the player at bat was anyone with garbage in his hand who had voice enough to call out , " Let her fly ! " before pitching it . The kid who did n't duck fast enough lost right there . Rules had been added and the game extended but you still had to be ready to duck every second . " Jacks check , the bullets say a buck , " he intoned unemphatically , hearing his own voice going on and on like a voice belonging to somebody else . " King sees , a buck to you Jacks , Jacks bump a buck , Big Ace sees ' n here we go , down ' n dirty , when you get a hunch bet a bunch , nothin ' to it if you know how to do it  --  turn ' em over when you 're down  --  man with the hammer bumps a buck , Jacks call  --  one bucket of paint all red  --  a winner every hand , hooked it in the dark he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make me laugh , thank you , the more you bet the more you get --  " " More , more , I keep cryin ' for more more more  --  " The old days , the old ways , before all the stoplights turned to red and there was still time between deals for a laugh or two over a nickel beer . " IIe ai n't even got his first papers ' n he got a City Hall job , " somebodycomplained of somebody else and the night was long , so long , and all night long the derisive little diamonds mocked the fat and happylookinghearts . And the sour spades , that had seen too much of everything and had been disappointed in it all for so long , stood aside withp118cynical indifference while the murderous black clubs ambushed the hopeful four flushes and the foolishly faithful four-card straights ; while the little old gray deuces died , heartbroken , by the way . Till the green silk bag was filled and emptied , half secretly , half guiltily , as a thousandgreen silk bags had been filled and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more more " I keep cryin ' for more more Give me more more moreAs this night followed a thousand nights and these men followed a thousand hopers who had sat here before them to go down to their graves holding a four-card straight in one hand and would never be remembered at all . Their mouths were stuffed with race-track dust ; and no one to remember at all . Their sons had taken their places , passing the time , while waiting for death to deal one from the bottom , by drawing to aces and eights . Their hell was a full house that never won and their last hope of heaven a royal flush . " He got a loaf of bread under his arm ' n he 's cryin ' , " somebody said of somebody else . While the biggest sucker of them all sat in the dealer'sslot till morning , getting relieved fifteen minutes every two hours , and thought and thought and thought . For every time he was relieved his newly recovered confidence slipped an inch . And the old regret , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kindle fresh flames of guilt . Guilt that burned like so many small strange flowers putting out petals of fire in place of leaves . " I told her in the hospital I was gon na make it all up to her . I 'm makin ' it up to her awright . Just one flight down . Through a different door . " " What 's it mean when a dealer 's hand gets shaky ? " Louie asked Schwiefka without looking at any dealer at all . " That 's the first sign of insanity , " Schwiefka decided . " Hell , it 's the last sign , " Frankie threw them both , out of sheer irritability . " I blew my stack a long time ago settin ' right here watchin ' tinhorn West Side gamblers tryin ' to make a pair of bullets out of one little acey . " " Do n't give me that old kapustka , " Louie ordered him . " You ai n't the guy to be rememberin ' anythin ' . " " Okay , " Frankie conceded with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time we both started forgettin ' , Louie. "  |p119Louie  nodded and held his peace . " The price just went up on you , Dealer , " he told himself confidently . " That stuff is gon na be awful hard to get around the middle of next week . " " Deal , deal , " Schwiefka demanded uneasily , sensing something old , unspoken and violent in the air , and the players all began wheedling the dealer at once . " Give us somethin ' to remember you by , Dealer  --  we 're gettin ' quartered to death here . " " Toward morning the farmer gets lucky , " Frankie assured every farmer present . And the cards went around and around . Thus in the narrowing hours of night the play became faster and steeper and an air of despair , like a sickroom odor where one lies who never can be well again , moved across the light green baize , touched each player ever so lightly and settled down in a tiny whiff of cigar smoke about the dealer 's hands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stave off morning forever . Each bet as if the loss of a hand meant death in prison or disease and when it was lost hurried the dealer on . " Cards , cards . " For the cards kept the everlasting darkness off , the cards lent everlasting hope . The cards meant any man in the world might win back his long-lost life , gone somewhere far away . " Do n't take it hard , your life do n't go with it , " was the philosophy of the suckers ' hour . But each knew in , his heart , when he said that , that he lied : each knew that his life was reshuffled here with every hand . Till the last fat red ten had been dealt , the final black jack had fallen , the case deuce had n't helped after all and the queen of spades had been hooked , by somebody , just one hand too late . " If it had n't been for me  --  if it had n't been for me --  " And the last discouraged sucker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . " What 's right is right , " Frankie decided as the last hand was dealt around , " you ca n't go smashin ' up a woman ' n then make a fool of her on top of it with another woman . A guy got to draw the line somewheres on how bad he can treat somebody who ca n't help herself no more just account of him . " Walking home with Sparrow where the long arc-lamp shadows slanted across the snow-wet walk , as on any lost corner at 4 A.M. , they heard a switch engine 's burdened coughing . " Trying to get up steam , " Sparrow whispered as confidentially as if he had just had it straight from the engineer.  |p120But  to Frankie Machine it sounded more like a man trying to cough with a thirty-five-pound monkey on his back . One breath to the second , no more and no less , as the hairy little paws tightened about his shouldersto get set for just one more ride . Under the shoulders , deep in the stomach 's pit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward his heart , did n't quite reach it and contracted again , leaving the heart fluttering with anxiety for the whole stomach to turn over : he retched , wanted to vomit and had nothing to vomit at all . That small cold claw would reach again , in its own good time , as mechanically as he himself could shuffle a cold deck at will . It would reach . It would get there and he 'd fight it down . It was just so damned hard to fight alone , that was all , with so little to fight for . A half pint of good whisky would keep it down until he could get to sleep ; but only for an hour . Then he 'd waken and no whisky would do him good in that hour . He 'd need Molly-O to hold him then . It would be Molly-0 or a quarter-grain fix , he 'd never make it alone . Every time he got sick lately it seemed the damned punk was on his heels , staring at him through those foggy glasses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he saw one . Why did n't the little chiseler speak out ? At the corner of Damen and Division he turned abruptly on Sparrow . " Which way you goin ' ? " Just like that . " Why  --  home , Frankie . Same as you . " " You tellin ' me where I 'm suppose to go now ? " Sparrow saw Frankie 's face then , peaked with suffering in the arc lamp 's feeble glow , and wanted to help and did n't know how and did n't want to understand . " I got business . " Frankie let him have the edge of the knife turning in his breast . " Case out . " Twice now within the week Frankie had turned on him like this , he was beginning almost to expect these sudden changes , meaningless and swift . With no further word the punk turned , feeling there was no place for him in any joint on Division Street , nor in the whole wide world , without Frankie Machine . Shuffling down the shadowed street , Sparrow hoped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could feel , for ten minutes , that he was going somewhere . He wanted to feel walls and safety about him , needed to be inside something . Frankie had been his wall and the wallp121was gone , leaving him as defenseless as he had been in the years before he 'd hooked up with the dealer . When he reached Paulina he realized Frankie must be kidding , wanting to teach him a lesson for something , making him walk just to see how far he 'd go before looking back  --  Frankie would be standing there waving to him to come back and get shoved around , pretending he was mad about something  --  Sparrow turned with swift hope . But no one waved in the arc lamp 's feeble glow for any punk 's returning . No one stood waiting under any arc lamp for any lost sparrow at all . Something tugged just hard enough at her foot to waken her ; the army blanket ha d fallen across her toes . Yet she sensed a secret message in being awakened so : someone was trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both sides of Division Street the occasional arc lamps burned and it was late , so late , there should be a light step on the long dark stair and someone to cry out that the night was too long . And come up to wheel her a little while . Whatever time it was , he was long past due . Unless there were two kinds of time in the world these days : Gamblers ' Time and Cripples Time and cripples must now set their watches by gamblers . All her life , it seemed in this winter hour , he 'd been standing her up somewhere . This time would count against him like the others , not one One would be forgotten . He 'd go to purgatory with what he had done to her on his soul and she 'd sit there then just as she sat here now . He would n't be getting rid of her in the hereafter , if there were any sort of justice at all , any easier than he could get rid of her on West Division . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It would be shipped right along with her best clothes , she supposed , and the Special Dispensation showing she really did n't belong in purgatory herself , she was just there to make sure that that Frankie Majcinek paid off . " He 's fixed me so 's I ca n't have no kid , " she pitied herself for the thousandth time , " that counts against him just as much as if he 'd killed somebody . He got to be fait'ful now ' r he wo n't even get as high as purgatory , " she assured herself confidently , and a twinge of perverse pleasure took her , twisting her lips into a loose and sensual line . " A man just got to stick by a wife who ca n't stand on her own two feet fivep122minutes at a time , " she felt with the same sense of a long-stale triumph . For if she 'd made a secret bargain with herself , in that darkened corner of the mind where all such bargains are made , she would stand by the deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frankie was bound to her and she was bound to the chair : she would not now return to that corner except in dreams . Not to that curtained hide-out , not to that secret place . She had gone to that bookie in the brain where hustlers ' hearts pay off to win , place or show . She had bet her health on a long one and waited each night to be paid off in her turn . A door slammed downstairs and the Jailer 's voice , heavy with sleep , called down irritably , " No rooms ! Too early ! Go by Wieczorek and sleep on pool table ! " But still no hand on the door below . No step on the long dark stair . Nor ever yet had wondered why she dreamed , so often with the same deep dream , of a distant cousin , a girl of nineteen who had died in Sophie 's childhood . She saw Olga in a nun 's habit walking down a long white corridor . It was night , the whole great hospital was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound of the nun 's slippered tread . Sophie saw the girl , all in white and immeasurably far away , as though looking through a minifying lens . The lens turned in her dreamingbrain , a narrow dark door opened and her own face , like a face seen under water , the eyes wide and brimming with joy : " Olga ! Honey ! Look ! I 'm on my feet again ! " She was crying for happiness in that dark door and wakened with a sob breaking like a small bone in her throat . Then the sense of loss that deepened as wakefulness widened , till the whole world seemed one great room wherein she had lost something long ago , something so dear , so dear . " Why should I worry ? " she asked herself suddenly , with a certain self-derision . " I got mine . " That was , seemingly , true enough . She had got exactly what she had wanted more than anything else in the world . Frankie Majcinek . Had him forever and for keeps and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place in the world for him , since the accident , save this one small furnished room . So now it was time to feel her victory in her heart , sweeter than all the dances she had missed through that perverted victory . Then why did it feel as though the all-night movies had all been emptied , why did it feel they must be showing broken reels to empty rows and that the all-night bakery fires had gone out : that the loaves would grow cold and mold slowly to dust in ten thousand rusting stoves ?  |p123Why  did it feel so late , so late that she would never get there in time after all ? " It 's just the way things would be if that Nifty Louie was God ' n Blind Pig was Jesus Christ , " she decided feverishly , " it 's just about the way them two 'd run things . " A trolley yammered past like a dog pursuing a rabbit and pulled up with a startled little yelp . And heard his step on the long dark stair at last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cries of morning . Until the night of the Great Sandwich Battle old Stash had only once given Violet concrete grounds for divorce . That had been the night he 'd gone on what she still referred to as his " tandem . " She had never let him forget that sorry occasion . It was bad enough that a man of his years should come wheeling in at 2 A.M. of a summer night with his shirt ripped half off his back  --  but before she could rip the rest of it off him her breath was cut off by the spectacle of somebody 's grandmother in nothing but a suit of long underwear , the high-heeled shoes once called " baby dolls " and one earringdangling like the final symbol of a misspent youth . When Vi had recovered her breath all she could gasp was , " Lady , whoever you are , they 're lookin ' for you  --  but they ai n't gon na find you here "  --  and rushed Grandma , drunk as a coot , down the hall and down the steps and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get her going in somebody else 's direction  --  then two steps at a time all the way back up to see what Old Husband was up to in that unusual condition . A good thing she 'd taken two at a time . He was tottering half out the window , trying to read the temperature on the thermometer nailed to the outside wall with his shoeless toes barely touching the floor . She hauled him back so hard he landed flat on his back in the middle of the bedroom floor , creaked over upon his side and went into a snoring sleep . But who wants to sleep with a drunk beside the bed ? She had rolled him , like a half-filled laundry bag , right under the springs . But he 'd tossed and mumbled so restlessly there that at last she had hauled him out of it by the ankles , supported him down the hall with his head dangling like a Christmas rooster 's , into the broom closet . Putting a pillow under his head , she 'd locked him in with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lesson , Old Man . " After that the hall broom closet had been his punishment for almostp124any misdemeanor . The last stretch he 'd spent in there had been for doingnothing worse than bringing home a loaf of day-old pumpernickel . She 'd warned him that she would n't eat day-old food but yet he fancied , after fifteen months of married life , that she rejoiced secretly in all his bargains . He had a sneaking senile conviction that she 'd married him because he knew where all the best bargains were to be had for just a little wheedling and the wearing of a tattered sweater . " Makin ' poor mouth , " Violet called it . And for this reason kept his bargain-store addressesa secret from her , for fear that when she found them out she would leave him . What other reason could she have had for marrying him ? he had asked himself in the cold white light of day . Old Husband was n't just anybody 's fool . He was everybody 's in general and Violet 's in particular . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all his day'r spoils into the container at the end of the hall . When he 'd seen her do that he had retired to the closet voluntarily . Perched upon a bucket there , a frayed blanket clutched closely about him as the night wore on and the hall grew chill , he had worried most of all about whatever would the neighbors think . Neighbors could think what they damned well pleased in Violet 's book . Every hour on the hour she 'd sallied forth to denounce him through the closet keyhole . " Doopa ! Come out ! I got to slug you ! " Old Stash was too sly for that . He 'd stayed where he was . He never understood why such little things made her so hopping mad and it looked like he never would catch on this side of purgatory . Yet it was all for the best that he remain in the fog of cut-rate prices in which he wandered numbly between broom closet and icehouse and his own warm bed . For even though he did wise up there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be done about it . Sometimes she punished him by not letting him pull the date off the calendar for three or four days . Then , when he would hand her the Saturday night pay envelope , she 'd reward him by letting him tear off all three days in a row  --  she would have to watch him to see that he did n't go over into the coming week . Old Husband literally chortled with glee when he 'd gotten all three off and in his hand , if those three had finished the month . She had even caught him sneaking into the calendar at night to tear off a page while she slept . And once , in a panic of frustration , he had ruined an almost virginal calendar by ripping off sixteen weeks in ap125row ; as though he could no longer wait for the endless weeks to pass . She had put him to bed with a fever , soothing him with a hot-water bag across his stomach . It was n't simply bad luck that the bag had leaked a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night of the Great Sandwich Baffle Stash gave her , she felt , even further cause for separate maintenance . Although , if the sausage had n't slipped out of the sandwich , everythingwould have been fine and dandy , like sugar candy . That was one accident that Violet could n't blame the punk for . It was one time it was truly all her fault , for bringing him upstairs when she knew Old Husband was likely to wake up . Still , it 's not easy to blame Violet either . Maybe it was really Stash 's fault for going to bed too early . Unless it was Stash 's boss 's fault for working the old man so hard he could n't stay awake after supper , just when Violet would start taking out the pin curls and getting ready to go places and see things . " I used to cry sometimes when I first married Stash , " she confessed to Sophie , " I did n't have no place to go . I used to shave him with a ' lectric razor then . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sound it makes . That 's the oney pleasure that old man ever give me . " On the night of the Great Sandwich Battle she fixed him a glass of warm tomato juice with a raw egg floating in it  --  Widow Wieczorek had confided in her that it had worked wonders with the late Emil W. when he 'd first started slipping . But Stash turned in half an hour earlier than usual ; all it had done was to make him limper than ever . " Next time I 'll try goat 's milk , " Violet planned wistfully , watchingm shuffling off toward the bedroom with the left-hand flap of his winter underwear dangling . " If that do n't work I might as well be a widow too . Wonder if there 's such a thing as a pension for icehouse widows . Them big ice blocks could be dangerous , all sorts of things could happen . " She just was n't tired a bit . She had n't done a thing all day except towheel Sophie to the Pulaski , return to sweep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snored on the bed , sluice the stairs forChwabatski and sweep the water down four flights into the gutter , thenikon up her own rooms and heat up some restaurant leftovers she'ddecided were ripe enough for Old Husband 's supper . He 'd hauled themess half a mile the evening before and had weighed it before leavingp126for work to be sure she did n't eat more than her share before he returned . Vi did n't mind heating the moldy stuff so much as long as she was n't expected to share it . " He do n't care what he scoffs up , " she marveled nightly , " so long as it 's a big bargain is all that counts  --  ' n both sides of the sandwich to match . Do n't ask me why , he do n't like it when one side of the sandwich is bigger than the other . " " Is all dirty , too t'in , " Stash described an uneven sandwich . It affrontedsome deep and childish hope still living within him that everything in the world  --  even sandwiches  --  be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The same sort of hope , perhaps , which led him to stop at the same currency exchange regularly to change dirty dollars for nice new clean crisp ones . " Cott this opp ! " he would demand of the cashier , handing her a soiled ten-spot  --  when she had humored him and he was tucking away ten crisp new singles he would feel he 'd driven the cleverest sort of bargain . Even the weather must come out even for Old Husband . Hardly anythingpleased him more than a nice even-numbered temperature , like 60 or 80 or 100 . Just as the best days of the month seemed to him to be the 10th , the 20th and the 30th . Yet now that it was time for him to go to bed , Violet was one wife who knew her duty . Stash sometimes could n't get to sleep unless she was lying beside him . And you never could tell for sure , maybe that egg would have a delayed kick . But tonight he was drowsing by the time she had her skirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brides . Particularly since she was wearing , for the very first time , a pair of lacy black Suspants the punk had stolen for her from Nieboldt 's . Who is supposed to appreciate a glamorous thing like that , a thing an actress might be wearing  --  skintight with garter tabs  --  if not a girl 's husband ? She sat admiring her legs , pointing the tinted toenails delicatelyto emphasize the long slimness of her calves and the full womanly bow of her thighs . Violet was a good girl at heart . But even a nun needs the appreciation of others . For the tinted toenails and the fancy garter tabs there was no man near to so much as say " Wow ! " She looked at her watch . Ten o'clock and right on the hour the old man began snoring up a row that made her wonder what in the world had been in that egg after all . From below , between snores , rose thep127pre-Christmas revelry of the Tug &; Maul . She pulled the shade like lowering a curtain upon temptation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canyon all the way through , she was that bored . Then just sat looking down at Stash 's toothless maw , open and drooling a little , comparing it with the square and virile set of Canyon 's jawbone . Even the punk had more jaw than old Stash  --  in some ways , she remembered with real warmth , the punk did n't have to give an inch to Canyon . She turned out the bed light and lay for a while remembering past laughter and wondering what she 'd been thinking of in marrying the old man anyhow . Because she 'd wanted to take care of somebody  --  or for his fifty a week ? A bit of both , she compromised anxiously . Then making no particular effort to keep from waking him , crawled over him , teasing the hairs sticking out of his nostrils with the nipple of her breast just for the hell of it , shoved her feet into slippers and tightened her winter coat modestlyover her sheer nightdress . " Go to sleep , Stash , " she told him gently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a turkey raffle . " Locked the door behind her and stepped softly down the stairwell into the murmurous corridors of night guarded so constantly , as on all winter nights , by Prager beer signs and the great Milwaukee Avenue moon . Prager beer signs down one side and High-Life down the other , all the way down Milwaukee to the streets where the dark people live , drinking cheaper beer . And who should be sitting at the bar , goofy and gay as always , but Sully Saltskin . " D. ' n D. ' do n't mean drunk ' n disorderly ' in my case , " he was explaining to Antek the Owner . " In my case it means Damen ' n Division , ' ' cause that 's where I always wait when I want to get picked up . " " Just do n't get picked up for anythin ' worse'n D. ' n D. , " Owner counseled him . " That 's where I got them , " Sparrow whispered confidentially . " That K vorka ai n't got the heart to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too long . If he did Bednar 'd fire him , Bednar likes me too . " In fact all our most ignorant people were there and the juke played on and on . " Oh , my man he 's six foot three , He knows just what to do for me. "  |p128Well  , little Solly S. was n't any six foot three , but he knew how to treat a girl till she felt he must be five-ten at least . They had quite a few together , he 'd taken the night off just to show Schwiefka how much the joint needed him at the door and had been waiting here in the hope she might come downstairs for a small beer after Old Husband was safely tucked in the sack . They teased each other and drank till closing time , when Sparrow said he was " hungry enough to eat little ginny pigs . " " I 'm so hungry if I ca n't have a sandrich I got to have a pint , " was just how the punk put it . " So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your house . " " Stash would n't like , " Vi explained sorrowfully , ordering that closingtimeshot with which one defies all sorrowing . " It 'll be okay , " Sparrow fixed everything , " we 'll give him half the bottle . Then we 'll turn on the radio ' n dance . " " Stash would n't like . " " Why not  --  the radio broke ? " " The radio 's all right . " Violet was weakening so fast that when he hooked her arm and said , " Let 's go , " she finished the shot that made everything seem just the way everything ought to have been long before this night . Owner was putting the chairs up on the back bar and the lights in the big brass juke were running down like a rain-washed sunset . They steered each other outside and up the first flight to home in a weaving progress , each urging the other to walk more soberly . " Watch how I do it , " Violet commanded , going up four cautious steps and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Sparrow made it fine , clear to the top of the first flight all by himself ; and stood trying to focus his eyes behind the shell-rimmed glasses until she 'd made it all the way too . " Poor old Stash , " she giggled , " he works too hard . " That set them both to tittering as if it had been the funniest thing they 'd heard in a month . " You know what ? " she asked . " What ? " " Works too hard . " This time it was even funnier , she had to hold the banister to keep from falling back downstairs . As they wove past the second-floor desk Poor Peter Schwabatski looked upon them reverently from beneath half-lowered lids : he saw strange angels passing all night long . These two seemed holier , somehow , than any that yet had passed . The Jailer planted his horse-facedp129dimwit behind the desk each night in the hope he might be mistaken for a watchman ; the boy passed the creaking midnight hours by planting paper daisies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the desk to embroiderthe dusty old legend , Quiet or Out You Go Too . To which no guest had as yet offered the slightest deference . Poor Peter 's pious regard subdued Violet and on the final flight she shushed Sparrow though he was making no sound at all . " Hard-workin ' people . Must n't wake up hard-workin ' people . " So both felt very sad , all the way down the hall to her door , for hard-working people everywherethat must n't be waked up in the middle of the night . They stood together one moment in the threatening dimness , like the dimness in which all their lives had been lived  --  and decided to laugh together like that just once more . He threw back his head like a demented spaniel and howled , " Whaaaat ? " " Works too hard . " Only this time it was n't funny at all . For all the doors belonged to hard-working people . All the doors 9f both their lives and nobody laughs at a thing very long when he 's drunk out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crouched beneath a single-faucet sink : they were lined up there like a scoreboard recording the emptiness of her hours . For in the room beside the sink an old man slept her sweetest hours away . " Open the door , Richard , " she giggled unhappily , handing him the key . He took it without putting it in the lock while she studied him . " Honey , " she asked solemnly , " how come you never met Stash f form'lly " " How come I 'm s'pposed to  --  form'lly ? " " How come you ai n't s'ppose to , what I want to know , " she insisted , feeling the whisky move . When she put it that way Sparrow realized he was supposed to meet Old Husband all along . It seemed then that Old Husband had been waiting politely to meet Solly Saltskin a long tune and now was his big chance to give the old man the break he deserved . Old Man worked too hard , he deserved something to happen t o him in his declining years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deserved something nice in their declining years . He ought to do more for the people , they had such a hard way to go . " That 's right , " he agreed at length , " form'l obligation . " " Shamed myself , you never met Old Man , " Vi confessed , taking the key and opening the door herself.  |p130Inside  she threw off her coat , unmindful that she wore only a sheer nightgown underneath ; but then it was so warm and everyone was such old friends . From the bedroom came a low warning rumbling as if the Garfield Park Express were running straight through the house . " Change cars in there ! " she called good-naturedly . Yet something about Old Husband sleeping in there like a child , so alone , filled her with such a rush of tenderness for him as she had never before felt . As soon as she had finished making a sandwich for Sparrow she made one for Stash out of the crusts , so that it would look like a big bargain . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to meet Sparrow . " Look , it 's Christmas awready ! " she cheered Old Husband awake . " We got Sparrow for comp'ny ' stead of Santa Claus  --  ai n't that won-derful ? " He was n't yet sufficiently wide awake to tell how wonderful it all was . Just poked his frightened old eyes about the room , so suddenly filled with light and harsh cries that had been so dark and still with sleep but one moment before . " Where you gone ? " he asked at last . " Ai n't gone , been awready , " she saw him start at something over her shoulder , then droop one eyelid to see the apparition better . " What is ? " Old Husband wanted to know . " That 's him , that 's Sparrow , honey  --  did n't I ever tell you about Sparrow ? Sparrow ! I never even to-old him a thingg . " Her giggle alone would have betrayed more than whisky to anyone but Old Creep Stash . While Sparrow , with the light from the night-bulb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying something real nice , anyone could see . It was n't clear just what because his mug was stuffed with Polish sausage and its string was dangling from the corner of his mouth . A fellow could choke that way , just saying something nice . " Shall I make you another , lover ? " Violet wanted to know . Under the night light 's pale green glow Lover nodded . " Yup . Two more . Wit ' little ginny pigs ' n ketchup all togedder . " " Dronk t'ings , " Old Creep disapproved , scraping his toes about the carpet in a vague hope of finding slippers there . " Is bad , not drassed , " he added , reddening at the spectacle of his own wife cavorting about before a stranger in nothing but a sheer nightgown . What kind of big bargain was that ?  | " You boys talk over old times together , " Violet suggested lightly , making another dash for the kitchen . Sparrow sat on the bed 's edge beside this Stash , feeling remotely troubled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bread off the sandwich , wiped the mustard off carefully upon Stash 's sheet , gave the opposing slice the same treatment and resumed chewing . " Do n't like mustard , " he explained . " I got hard day , " Stash asserted , eying the string dangling so unevenlyfrom the corner of the punk 's mouth ; as if that held some solution for the peculiar way in which things were being run by Stash Koskozka 's house this night . " You like mustard ? " Sparrow asked , to keep the conversation sprightly . " Do n't like mustard , do n't like sandrich , do n't like comp'ny , " Stash challenged him boldly , " all too t'in . " Sparrow shifted the string a bit to show he was thinking that over . Then let it down and rolled it neatly back up to show he was shrugging , sustaining this yo-yo-like indifference until Violet returned with his second sandwich . " Do n't want sandrich , " Stash persisted , growing petulant  --  then saw it had n't ever been intended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep Sparrow from having it , grabbed at it so abruptly that the sausage slid out and slipped down his winter underwear to lodge loosely into the top of his heavy winter socks , making a bulge there the size of an ankle and leaving a light trail , like an insect 's trail , down the underwear . " Goofy t'ing , you make clomsy by me , " Stash scolded the spot Sparrowhad left on the sheet . It was , he perceived , Polish sausage that was to blame for everything tonight . " You should n't wear your underwear to bed anyhow , " Violet reproachedthe old man , " you 'd sleep better in pajamas . " " After all , " Sparrow mocked him , " he ai n't so young you should wake him four o'clock by morning , he should make glad for you because pretty soon is Christmas , ai n't it ? " Stash chose to overlook the mockery . With unruffled poise he fitted his upper plate into place and shuffled it loosely about a moment to make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it into place Irritated Violet like fingernails screeching down a blackboard . " After all the work I went to , " she mourned her marriage tardily now , " gettin ' out of bed in the middle of the night to make my husband ap132snack ' n what does he do but slap it out of my hand ' n call me goofy t'ing '  --  I got a good Polish education ' n I married the biggest dummy ever walked in shoeleather "  --  she turned on Stash  --  " get up ' n wash the peanuts off ! Get up ' n take last mont 's bat ' ! " Yes , it had been just about the finest sandwich a loyal little wife could make her man but instead of thanking a person he just sat sucking his teeth in front of the first real company she 'd had in days . " No-good t'ing , " Stash insisted , distressed by the mild itching of the mustard drying between his toes , and brought his knee up to investigate that itch at the precise moment that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her over the eye . That did it . That was all she had , subconsciously , been waiting for since her unconsummated honeymoon . " You done that a-purpose ! " she gasped , and cracked him across the upper plate with the flat of the carpet slipper . " Let 's see who 's the clumsy t'ing , " she challenged him , feeling the whisky rise in her throat with her rage , and Sparrow shifted a bit to give Stash room enough to fling the retrieved sandwich , mustard , ketchup , pickles and all straight into Violet 's face and down the shadowed hollow of her gown . Sparrow looked so sorry . He did n't like to see food wasted that way . Before he could recover even a small section of the sausage Vi gave the old man the slipper again , the upper plate popped out and he yelped like a lashed pup expecting more . You could sec Stash 's lip beginning to swell , he put a hand to it tentatively but she slapped the hand down . He clasped the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hard-working man this way . " Work all day , seven days , no days off , buy nize t'ings by howz , " he sobbed brokenly , " pay grocernia , pay buczernia , pay mens I do n't even know what 's for , comes time to sleep everyting all paid ' n nize clean howz so ever'body sleep  --  who comes by howz from whisky tavern ? " A drop of blood mixed with sweat and tears dropped down the point of his tiny chin . " Mrs. No-good wit ' dronk pocket-picker ! Should be in bed by hoosband , hits by hoosband instead on head ' n makes funny : Is Christmas , now we fight all night ! ' Is somethin ' got to happen , is all . " He dropped the pillow , reached for the dresser drawer , came up with his .38 and banged Violet across her new permanent with the butt . Sparrow watched the sausage slide at last out of the depths of the gown and saw , with a melancholy regard , a fine round piece roll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mustard or indignation where the sock was torn . Sparrow felt a twinge of disgust at the way everything in the joint , bedclothes , underwear , curtains and walls , was daubed with fresh mustard . One hell of a way to run a house . " Rein ' unsanit'ry is worse'n bein ' goofy , " he philosophized softly while recovering the remains . " Funny I done like mustard "  --  wiping the bread clean on a handy corner of the dresser scarf . Heard the bathroom door slam and glanced up to see why all these people were so excited . Stash was in a neutral corner , breathing hard and looking beat to the floor . Sparrow saw him lay the .38 back in the drawer , put his head between his hands and whimper . Must be crying because he was so hungry , Sparrow reasoned . " You want a bite , Old Man ? " he asked consolingly . " Anybody could have a appetite after all the exercise you just done . How come you do n't take it easy nights after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the handle at bot ' ends ? You like a nice piece sandrich ? " Stash shook his head ; he was too miserable to raise it . " You do n't relax enough , " Sparrow counseled him . " You 're not so young like you think no more . If you do n't take things a little easier you 'll lose your stre n't , you wo n't be able to do your fancily duty . You might even lose your job . After all you got responsibilities , Old Man . " " How can sleep ? " Stash pleaded with a ptomaine eye . " Is too much gone on . I 'm tellin ' ! Pretty soon hoosband gone by brooms closet . " " Do n't bother , " Sparrow reassured him , " we still got two flutes from Old McCall left . " " Is not for drinkin ' , by brooms closet  --  is for some place sleepin ' ! Sleepin ' ! " His voice rose in a plaintive wail for peace and understanding , trying to make someone on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need sleep any more on Division but poor old Stash Koskozka . Sparrow studied him calmly , with a steerer 's clammy eye . " What you liollerin ' at me like I was a unnerground dog ? You tryin ' to make trouble for me ? " " All he is to me is trouble , " Violet affirmed loudly from the bathroom . " You must be siko-static , Old Man , " Sparrow decided with his best bedside manner , " you should go by a siko-stat . He 'll take yer ternper'ture . He 'll patch yer dirty roof where it 's leakin ' a little . You look like somethin ' the cat never buried . " I n the bathroom Violet studied her image with a rising dismay : ap134thin streak of drying blood soiled her ten-dollar one-day-old permanent . Her hair would have to be shampooed and hennaed and there went the sawbuck she 'd been a full month chiseling off Old Husband . She strode back into the bedroom and jerked the old man 's head up with a neat rap under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You rurned my perm'nent . You gon na give me a tenner for another . " She began hauling him by brute strength as if to the nearest cashier 's window ; at the bathroom door he broke free . " I 'm gone ! " he shrieked , breaking blindly for cover down the hall , bumping from doorway to wall all the way down to the broom closet , pausing there to fumble down the sides of his long underwear . The closet key was in his pants , the pants were hanging on the bedpost and he could n't understand why he could n't find any pockets now . For the closet was his sanctuary , where a chair and an army blanket , kept in reserve for storms like this , would lend him a brief security , if not sleep , before morning lighted the way toward his icehouse refuge . But something about his feeble fumbling at the closet door enraged her anew . " You ai n't even man enough to get into a closet , " she taunted him brutally . Stash turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his long drawers and told her , like a saucy child , " Who wants ? I 'm not tell Mrs. No-good where at is chippest restaurant-bakeree on Division . Ha ! Ha ! " " Go on ! " Violet commanded . " Get in there ! Who wants you ' n your secondhand pumpernickel ? You 're bot ' dried up ! Lock the door after you , go croak under the scrub pail , it 's where you was born ! You ' n the rest of the brooms ! " Abruptly , inflamed by a memory of day-old beef stew , she bore down upon him . Stash wheeled and made for the fire escape , one side of the hall to the other like a rider on a trick bicycle , trying to ward off her blows with his thin little elbows . Down the hall a woman with her hair in crimpers opened her door just the tiniest crack . " Do n't excite yourself , honey , " she advised Violet . Immediately Vi raced back  --  for what she was n't certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tossed it so wearily . Sparrow stepped lightly to one side to let her pass on the return trip . " Where 'd that motherless animal go ? " she wanted to know . Just like that : " Where 's that motherless animal hiding ? " " Hoosband went that way , " Sparrow informed her , pointing helpfully toward the fire escape , " only he got no pants . Ai n't you gon na give yer old man his pants , honey ? "  | " What for ? He ai n't gon na have nothin ' left to put into ' em . I 'm gon na shoot it off . " " Wait , " Sparrow cautioned her . " Do n't plug him till I get the pants . I do n't like seein ' a man get shot wit'out pants on . " His sausage string wandered up and down while he picked the pants off the bedpost , brushed them down with the butt of the sausage and wandered back down the passage , casually inspecting the names on the doors to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' nest . Poked his nose onto the fire escape to see if anything worth watching awhile was going on out there : not much doing there either . Just the white bottom of an old man 's underwear shuddering wretchedly through the frost-covered crisscrossed ironwork in the winter dawn . Just an old man holding his head in his hands trying , somehow , sometime , to get to sleep for a little while . It looked pretty cold to Sparrow , trying to sleep all scraunched up like that with Violet sneaking up underneath and the alley arc lamp 's light shimmering down the barrel of the .38 . " I like to get up close to accidents , " Sparrow recalled , switching the string in mild anticipation , and just as he switched it Violet pointed the barrel toward the arc lamp : in the shattering of the lamp the old man went forward with the blast as though catapulted by the Hindquarters of Destruction . To come up with his knees on the ironwork and his fingers clutching Violet 's fluttering gown . " Stash give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready to cry , he was that crushed by fear . " Then get your dirty wallet ' n start makin ' good , " she gave him his terms . " ' N while you 're gettin ' it put water on the stove for dishes . You 'll have just time to clean them up before you go by job . **26;4373;TOOLONG , Old Man , I got to get some sleep sometime tonight . " She herded him down the hall before her . In the dimness Stash paused to plead over his shoulder , " You not shoot Old Man in ess , hoa-ney ? " " I just ai n't made up my damned mind . " Then saw someone else in the hall and made her damned mind up in a hurry . Sparrow was leaning confidently against the wall , advising a shadow wearing a badge , " Here 's your man , Sergeant , here 's your man . " Stash felt the .38 returned gently to his hand and held it in dull surprise . It was just like one of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's business when they ought to be in bed . Sparrow chewed on while the officer relieved Stash of the .38 and all three eyedp136Old Husband suspiciously while he struggled , first on one foot and then upon the other , into his greasy work pants . Nobody offered him an arm to lean upon , even when he went face forward and caught himself , by sheer luck , against the wall . " Looks like one of them Berkshire cases to me , " the law surmised . " If I had n't happened along you 'd be up on a murder rap  --  how many people you slaughtered with this thing lately , Old Man ? " " He sure has been terrerizin ' us t'night , " Sparrow put in . Stash gaped and looked to Violet for help . An odd place to look for it . " How about my ten bucks ? " was what Violet wanted to know . Stash turned hopefully to Sparrow . " He buries his dead under his fingernails is what they tell me , " Sparrow felt it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head in vague assent , sensing he had somebody on his side at last . " You good boy , " he thanked Sparrow for everything . He could tell that Sparrow was going to make something nice happen for everybody now . So everyonecould have secondhand twist bread and go back to bed . " Maybe he oney fired to scare her , " Sparrow suggested , not wanting to take any chances on having to sleep with Old Man rather than Violet . Over the officer 's shoulder he saw Poor Peter 's face , as white and long as the face of an Aberdeen rabbit , come peering . Sparrow waved once and the docile , dolorous mug disappeared once again into the dimness . The jailer would n't be able to make much sense out of what Poor Peter would be trying to tell him , the things he had seen in the night , that was certain . While all down the hall neighbors peeked out of darkened cracks just long enough to see what was going on without becoming involved . Every time the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ever so softly ; as though only the morning wind were shutting it . " You ever confined to an institution ? " the officer turned on Stash professionally . " He means where you work , Old Man , " Violet translated loosely . " Sure , sure , worrrk ever ' day , sixteen-eighteen hour , I 'm not gone by yoo-nyun . " Stash put a timid hand on Vi 's broad shoulder . " My hoa-ney , " he explained , feeling that the gesture would clear everything up . And shivered in the bitter tenement wind . " My hoa-ney , I 'm still love her . " Someone , he felt uneasily with that uneasy wind , was trying to take his hoa-ney away . " You got a damned funny way of showing affection , " the ace ob/served , playing a flashlight onto one of the slightly ajar doors . " I 'll have to book this old sot for drunk ' n disorderly , creatin ' a nuisance of hisself , malicious mischief ' n attemp ' to do great bodily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that arc lamp , cowboy ? " He flashed the light briefly to surprise anyone reaching for a five-spot . But caught no one reaching for a thing . " The courts are very severe on these cases of late , " the ace went on regretfully , " it might be assault wit ' attemp ' to tap a gas main for immoral purposes for all I know . Seems to me you answer the descriptionof Firebox Phil , the fiend who 's pullin ' boxes for the purpose of pickin ' the fire chief 's pocket when he hangs his coat on the hook-'n-ladder . " The wind searched curiously all the way down to the end of the hall ; yet no one reached for a fiver at all . It turned and jostled back between them , nudging each suggestively . Yet no one came up with a crying dime . " You better look out or he 'll try to buy you off , " Sparrow warned the law . " Where you work ? You look awful familiar to me , " the ace turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye-dintification . " Sparrow 's wallet was in apple-pie order . It was n't his , but it was all there : the photostated discharge stolen off a sleeping drunk on a Humboldt Park local and the Social Security card with the carelessly forged signature . He let the ace see there was n't so much as a single loose deuce in the package . " Now let 's see yours , Scarface , " he turned back to Stash , sensing easier game . He did n't want to fool with the one in glasses , he looked like some kind of crook . " Worrrk by izehowz , " Stash insisted , feeling the net beginning to close . " He did n't even register for the Spanish-Americun War , I bet , " Violet scoffed , while Old Husband hauled out his icehouse badge and his Christmas bonus check . " ' N you told me you were broke just last night ! " Violet whooped in indignation . " Gim me that ! A fine pervider you turned out to be , holdin ' out on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pumpernickel with a uncashed check in your poke ! I guess you figure you could take it with you ' r somethin ' . "  | " If he ca n't he wo n't go , " Sparrow put in , and apologized immediately , " I heard that on the radio . " The ace craned his neck , inwardly cursing his slowness in failing to grab the check first  --  not a loose fin among the three of them . Maybe he ought to make them take off their shoes ; if he could just think of one good reason for the pair still wearing them . Well , he could always get a fin for the gun from any Division Street hood . " Now I go by worrrk , " Stash announced , hugging himself to keep warm while Violet , relenting at last , buttoned his fly . When the whisky ebbed she 'd be half sorry for him . " Now you go by station howz ' n get good lawyer , " the officer correctedStash . " Maybe you 'll talk better English after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep Stash looked homesick for bed . Anybody 's bed . Was there such a place left in the world where no one woke you up at a quarter to four , plastered you with mustard and ran you onto a fire escape in your underwear for neighbors to make bad scandals ? " We got a nice dry cell for you  --  or do n't you think it 's time for your fam'ly to get a little rest ? You ought to be ashamed , a man of your age , ' n holdin ' out on your kids on top of it . " Apparently he 'd concluded that Sparrow and Violet were brother and sister . Old Husband hung his unhappy old head . he just had n't known you could be arrested for holding out a pay check on your wife . Down the stairwell and by the ace 's firm hand on the back of his belt , all the way down , he realized now it was a real bad thing he had done . " Could sleep by station howz ? " He wriggled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffee ' n a sausage sandrich for you too . " Stash slid his dim eyes sidewise like a condemned rooster 's . " Please  --  no sandrich . " Violet and Sparrow , standing with arms hooked about each other 's waists as the first light began carpeting the ironwork of the fire escape and started down the hall , watched from the alley window while the law helped Stash into a squad car . They saw the little red taillight wink up at them once . To warn them to be good children so they 'd never have to go to jail . " That old man is certainly a lot of trouble to me , " Violet sighed as the car pulled east out of the alley and wheeled south toward the station . " I hope they take him to Racine Street better'n by Saloon Street  --  byp139Racine they got mattresses , " Sparrow hoped wanly in the wan city dawn . While the light of Chicago 's vast West Side , like the light of nowhere else in the world , crept softly , with its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls . " What makes that old man so mean in the first place ? " Sparrow wondered . " Do n't you treat him nice ? " The light filtered down from a hundred thousand roofs and across the floor just as it had filtered across the Humboldt Park lagoon on their first mornings together , when the lagoon was the thrill of a clandestine honeymoon month , before the whole world started acting clandestinely . Violet shrugged . " They all get that way when they get old , " she advised him like a grandmother . " I 'm not so hungry no more , " Sparrow decided , " one more sandrich is all I could eat . " " Just the same , it was mighty sweet of you to pick up the sandrich when he slugged me wit ' it  --  did you see him hit me ? " For one moment he felt she was going to get mad all over again . Then she added : " The poor old man , " and Sparrow knew she was almost sober . " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " spendin ' on hair like yours is just tarnishin ' the lily . With hair like yours you could be a model ' n pose . " " Yeh , " she laughed off his praise , " under the arms maybe . " She raised her arms elegantly , like a real lady in a deodorant ad , high over her head . " Anyhow it ai n't red , it 's just awe-burn . Would you like me wit ' red hair all over ? " " I like redheads of any color  --  oney first fix the sandrich ' n get some clean sheets on the bed . Old men ' r kind of moldy , you know . ' N leave the dirty mustard off . Off the sandrich , I mean . It got on the sheet awready , somehow . You know what I mean ? " " I know what you mean , " she replied , and went to the bedroom to change the sheets and stash Stash 's upper plate in the drawer on top of the .38 , wondering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever going to eat without his plate . There was a daub of blood on her slip and she was examining it when the punk shambled in and said , " Let 's see . " " No , " she told him firmly , " there 's blood on it . I do n't think a man should look at blood on a woman . I do n't like the sort of man that would . "  |p140So  Sparrow ignored the slip , he was accustomed to her superstitions . " I hope Old Man gets a good lawyer , " he hoped . " Yeh , " Violet repented , " I 'd hate to see him lose that job . But maybe this 'll teach him to quit dictatin ' everybody . Honey , that string is ticklin ' me . " Sparrow generously switched the string to the other corner . It was better than no love at all . He had n't stopped by Molly Novotny 's door for three nights and three days . But for the second time in the week he had had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was through and meant it . So he wanted to tell Molly how she had helped him to beat the stuff just in time . He came down the stairs with Rumdum plowing on a leash before him and his mind went down the stairs one bound ahead of the hound . Frankie had dark-haired Molly on his mind as well as the needle and he could n't get either off . His eyes had a curtained look ; to hide the need of both from himself . But Rumdum 's were hotly eager for everything . For Rumdum had good beer and Girlie on his mind and he and Frankie were going calling together . Within Frankie heard the phonograph 's sleepy murmur , but he did not knock . Some aversion to knocking at this door still held him , it must always be somehow accidental and nobody 's responsibility ; he kicked Rumdum in an oblique hope that the dog might protest loudly enough to get Molly 's attention . But the hound only slid one cold eye sidewise . When the murmuring paused Frankie stepped , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rumdum put it between his legs and sat down heavily upon it , looking as wronged as a hound could look : he did n't want to take responsibility either . Frankie stood looking down at the ravenous-looking freak at his feet and saw a shiver , as of returning life , run through that mangy and bloated form : the beer-clogged nostrils had picked up , faintly , Girlie 's special scent . A scent , for Rumdum , like that of no other bitch the whole endless length of Division Street . He bristled and forgot himself long enough to give forth with a low , menacing , masculine growl , reservedstrictly for occasions when no opponent was in sight . Molly heard that boastful rumble and opened the door just a crack . " He stopped dead here ' n I could n't get him a step farther , " Frankie explained casually . " I think he got a crush on Girlie . "  | " He sounds mad at somebody . " " He 's just puffin ' that on . All he is is thirsty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care of . Say , I 'm sort of dry myself . How about a little Christmas cheer ? You dry ? " And fetched Rumdum a sharp kick to make him leave off growling long enough so a person could make himself heard . " I guess he 's likely to go on like that till he gets some beer in him . " She opened the door just wide enough so that he could brush past , if he pleased to , or stay where he was . Yet gave him the benefit of both breasts against his arm as he passed . He sat down in the big red upholstered chair in the corner , looking shabbier than ever in his stained field jacket . While Rumdum swished about his legs , suddenly coy after all his growling threats about what was going to happen to her if he ever got within paws ' reach of her lovely flanks . Girlie , snarling defensively down at the oversized mongrel from her sanctuary in Molly 's arms , seemed to share some of those reservations about Rumdum which Molly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lately ? " I 'll tie her up , " Molly announced , and when she returned to her guests : " I left her a saucer of milk . She is n't old enough for beer . " " If she hangs around this one she wo n't drink nothin ' else , " Frankie bragged when Molly came to sit beside him on the chair 's broad arm . To study him with her direct child 's gaze . " You did n't come back , " she reminded him . " You went ' n got fixed again ' n was too ashamed to come back . " Her directness shook him , he had n't had time to lie . " It was the last one , Molly-O . " She 'd been planning for three days to give him the sharpest dressing down she 'd ever given anyone . Yet now that he was here , with the tired look under his eyes , all she could think of was , " I threw myself away on a man worth nothing at all . I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth something . " And took his head to her breast . " You do n't know what it 's like , " he told her without raising his head from the clean milk-and-fur odor of her . " All I hear up there is how I smashed her up a-purpose . If just she did n't think that . " " She 's got you thinkin ' you done it a-purpose , is that it ? " " All I know is she got me stonin ' myself . How does a guy know what he was really thinkin ' when he was stewed ? "  | " You ca n't take what she says now like it 's somethin ' real , Frankie  --  Sophie ai n't been right in the head since the accident , everybody knows that . " " But it was me made her wrong in the head then , ' n everythin ' I do since makes it worse for her , I do n't know why . What if one of them pin-curl biddies upstairs seen me come in here ? " Molly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own . He read an ancient anger there . " I ai n't forgot the time I was just a kid ' n she cracked me in front of everybody  --  ' n you backed off ' n let me go bawlin ' home by myself . You was that scared of her even then . ' Cause you did n't want to go home with her that night . You wanted to go home with me . It was how I wanted it too  --  things would have been better for me since then if you 'd done like you felt instead of like other people told you you got to . " He pressed her hands to his shoulders and turned his eyes away ; but she brought him back . " You know why Zosh slapped me that night ? ' Cause she was wrong in the head awready , that was why . She was evenin ' up on you way back then . You would n't fall in love with her the way she wanted you to , the way she was in love , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She never got another chance till the accident . That was her one big chance ' n she took it without even carin ' what she was doin ' to herself . It 's all she ever tried to do for you was to get even . ' N you 're lettin ' her do it every time you knock on that Fomorowski 's door or sneak up to see Blind Pig . You know it in your heart ' n you 're backin ' down from admittin ' it to yourself just like you backed down that other night . " Rumdum , jealous of Molly 's arms about Frankie , padded up and put his head on Frankie 's knee and Frankie caressed the big ugly muzzle absent-mindedly . Molly would n't let him go . " If you want that girl to get well you ai n't going to do it by gettin ' as sick in the head as she is . It 's what you 're doin ' every single time you pay off Louie to use that dirty hypo on you --  " " It ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got in my gut , it still hurts sometimes . " She shoved him away from her . " Do n't give me that Purple Heart romance . It 's nothin ' of the kind ' n you know it . If things were right with you you would n't be runnin ' to Louie because you got a pain in the belly . You 're runnin ' over there because you get to thinkin ' thep143whole thing is all your fault , that you smashed her up on purpose . She 's got you lyin ' to yourself , Frankie . You got to believe that that girl was wrong before the accident and the accident was just somethin ' that could have happened to anybody who 'd had one too many . " It happens every day , there was n't anythin ' special about yours  --  you think your accident was like made in heaven ? Can that bull . It was made right down at the Tug &; Maul at the bottom of a whisky glass ' n you better start pickin ' up the pieces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over . If she do n't want to put the pieces together for herself you got to do it for yourself . " Her hand , with its wrist as thin as a child 's , lay firmly upon his own . " Things have sure went to hell on a handcar since the accident , " he acknowledged . " Were they ever the way they should be between you ' n Zosh ? Beforethe accident , Frankie . That 's somethin ' I got to know . " He shook his head . No . It never had been . It had n't ever been right . " She never trusted me . " He 'd brought it out at last , avoiding Molly 's eyes . " Look at me . You think I can ? " It had been a long time since Frankie had looked at anyone steadily . How could he expect anyone to trust him who could not trust himself ? " I always trusted you , Frankie , from way back . I trust you now . " " I trust you too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let his eyes go at last . She unbuttoned his field jacket , he looked so warm , and tripped the knot of the little blue jazzbow about his throat like tripping the knot which held his innards so tightly of late . He felt the knot within loosen with the realization that he could talk straight to somebody at last . For how does any man keep straight with himself if he has no one with whom to be straight ? He had never fully trusted Sparrow , the punk thought too fast for him . In their world of petty cheats , phony braggarts , double clockers , elbow sneaks , small-time chiselers , touts and stooges and gladhand-shakers , one had always to be on guard . He had been on his guard since the day he 'd been chiseled out of two steel aggies back of the McAndrew School , when he was nine . He had been on guard with everyone since and with Sophie most of all . He had a blurred , reasonless conviction now that , somehow , it had been she who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replaced . She 'd never given his aggies back . He lost them anew to her everyp144day . Well , let her keep them then , let her keep everything . Let it be as she said , all his fault , and let him go at last . He felt an almost animal-like yearning to let his guard down and take all the blows there were in the world till there were no blows left : to sink under them in utter weariness into sleep and wake up being the real Frankie Majcinek . The Frankie who was straight with himself as he was with the world . The Frankie he had never been . To sleep a bit in this small room and waken to see the curtain flutter and feel a trust of all things near . To sleep so long , on this small woman 's olive breast , feeling her trust of him binding him like her arms , that he would waken to become what Molly once had glimpsed in him . What she knew he yet might be . He had never been trusted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being trusted hit him like a double shot on an empty stomach . He was n't ready for anyone 's trust . he had been too long trained in wariness to drop his guard that low . That low , and that fast . Wary of all straight answers . On all the backstreets of home he had learned how a straight answer could land a man in the lockup while the boy with the quickest lie stayed on the street . Yet  --  if there were just one person to whom one 's answers were always straight , just that might make the whole twisted world come straight  --  he looked up to see Molly reading him like reading yesterday 's race results . " All we done , from the first time we went roller skatin ' together , was fight , " he told her . " We battled all the time we went steady , we battled the weddin ' night till 4 A.M. , we started in again when we woke up ' n kept it up till I went in the army ' n started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it up till the night of the accident ' n we ai n't quit yet . " The naked bulb that burned overhead , by night , by noon , by twilit hours , hung like a little bald yellow skull on a chain like a twisted rope . Below it she had a candle burning , a candle red as wine . It 's tiny flame pointed , upon the yellow wall , to the skull burning overhead : it glinted a bit on the bottle of cheap cologne and in the depths of dark-haired Molly 's eyes . On the other side of the window a prairie snow fell across backstreet and tenement , looking for dry leaves upon which to rest and finding only concrete and steel . " I know , " Molly laughed with that laugh so soft one hardly heard the small rasp in it . " I heard you two goin ' at it one night , it soundedp145like all the dishes in the place gettin ' bust . I had to hold my ears . What went on ? " " ' What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went on : all the dishes in the joint gettin ' bust . She started it just to show me she did n't care one way or another , for dishes ' r me ' r anythin ' no more . So I helped her out to show her I did n't neither . I do n't . " " You just think you do n't , " Molly decided . " So now you 're eatin ' out of paper plates ? " " I ai n't eatin ' up there at all . Vi brings her soup in a bowl ' n I eat by Messinger 's on Milwaukee , it 's where you can lay your dirty head right down on the table ' n go to sleep ' n they do n't bother you if they seen you spent for coffee . " " I like Violet , " Molly told him as if thinking of something else , then said what she was trying to say . " Do n't go by Messinger 's no more when you want to put your dirty head down somewheres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to buy coffee to put it there . I 'm settin ' here three days now waitin ' for you , listenin ' to the Els go by , countin ' how many cars it sounds like . You do n't know how lonely it gets , waitin ' for El cars . Frankie , let 's both quit stonin ' ourselves . " He did n't know she was crying till her tears touched his lips . " I know how lonely it gets waitin ' for Els , " Frankie Machine told dark-haired Molly . Frankie sat in the dealer 's slot but he did not see the players . He saw only their shadows along the pale green baize and he dealt only to shadows . For each sat in the same seat every night and he knew each shadow well . The heavily crouching one to his left was Schwiefka 's , the trembling , pinheaded one was Sparrow 's ; the humble , headless and hunched-up one was Umbrellas ' , bent as though still carrying his daytimeburden . And the ever-shifting , wavering one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a shadow pocket for the shadow of a single cigarette , was the tallest , leanest shadow of all . " Louie 's all dressed up tonight , " Sparrow feigned admiration of Louie 's soft green fedora with the red feather in the brim and his poloponyshirt . " You goin ' cabaretin ' for Christmas Eve , Louie ? " " No , I just got tired of winnin ' in my old clothes , " Louie explained confidently , and shifted the fedora onto the back of his head so that everyone might see he had just had two bits worth of Division Streetp146sun tan and a Paradise Ballroom haircut . The man would never see fifty again , yet dandied about as if he were twenty-two , whistling at the girls and fingering his American Legion button  --  a habit derived after six months spent in Stateside army camps in 1918 . " I could of got ten to one in 1924 , " he announced . But no one asked him ten to one on what . Everyone knew . They 'd heard it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the year ' n that was only May , " he answered himself as though someone had asked , as if anyone cared . " Standin ' right there by the Four-Corner Tap I told Red Laflin he 'd be dead before I was ' n he lived twenny years ' n his best rod man is buyin ' me a shot every time I stop by the Four-Corner just to say hello , just for old time 's sake . You was Red 's best friend , ' he tells me , ' n puts the bottle on the bar . " " ' N you 're just the schleck to kill the bottle wit'out layin ' out a dime , too , " Sparrow observed . " Red must be turnin ' over when he sees his best rod man settin ' that big free bottle down . " " I mix it wit ' lemon , " Louie explained smugly , " it do n't burn up your insides that way . " " I always wondered who burned down Laflin 's joint , " Sparrow wonderedidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't no guy from aroundhere . " " Back off , Jewboy , " Louie told him , sounding bored , " your job is by the door . " " Zero 'll tell the steerer when to get by the door , " Frankie put in quietly . And the cards went around and around . " He 's just afraid I 'll win his dollar-twenny before the suckers start comin ' , " Sparrow explained of Louie . " Quit waspin ' him , " Frankie ordered . But Louie opened his wallet and started counting just to show how many " dollar-twennies " he was holding . There was a c-note right on top , then a couple fifties , then so many twenties and tens that Sparrow figured it , just offhand , at better than half a grand . " Thanks , Louie , " he offered , " I was just wonderin ' what you were holdin '  --  which alley you go home by ? I 'll walk you down . " " I could buy a hundred Jewboys , " Louie told no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poke . " We know where you get it , too , " Frankie said boldly , seeing nobody 's shadow at all.  | " We give the public what it asks for , " Louie smirked . " Be careful the public do n't give you what you 're askin ' for , " Frankie told him . And thought to himself , " This joker thinks he still got me on the hook , he 'll find out nobody needs him . " And the cards went around and around . There came a scratching like a cat 's scratching at the metal door , but Sparrow did not rise . " It 's just that blind hyena again , " he said , " let him wait . " " Let him in , " Frankie asked , " I need coffee . " Sparrow rose , and a moment later the greasy white cane and the gamy odor of the peddler moved across the table like a cloud off the canal . " Sit next to me , prosiak , " Nifty Louie ordered , pulling the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You want a hand of no-peek ? I heard you was pretty good at it . " " Ca n't deal no blind guy , " Frankie protested , " I 'll do everythin ' but that . " " Blind guys are the betht to deal , " Pig himself pointed out politely , " they ca n't tell what they 're holdin ' . " " I 'll read his hand , " Louie explained . " Blind , bummy ' r beggars , " Frankie insisted , " no two guys holdin ' one hand . " " I 'm goin ' to Stickney to play , " Louie announced , " this is Clark Street poker  --  hobo gamblers , hobo steerer , hobo dealer . " " If he stands behind Pig it 's awright , Frankie , " Schwiefka compromisedanxiously , " it 'll be Louie 's hand , only Piggy-O holdin ' it . Be sociable . " " Why ca n't he play it hisself ? " " I believe in blind man 's luck is why , " Louie told everyone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollar in front of Pig . Frankie reached over , tested the dollar against the metal shade of the night light , then peered more closely at its stain . " I seen that dirty buck somewheres before , " he decided , returning it to begin boxing the cards . " Somewheres before . That 's bloodstains on that dirty buck . " " The bank 'll cash it , " Schwiefka put in , " deal us a round of blackjack , make everybody happy . " " It 's my good-luck piece , " Louie told them all , " I 'm always superstitiousas a whorehouse rat toward Christmas . "  |p148Umbrella  Man rose uneasily and shuffled , still half crouching , into his coat , fearing the air of challenge going around the board . When Sparrowreturned , after letting him out , the soiled dollar lay in front of Frankie : he had dealt himself a winner . " Gim me back the silver . " Louie was laying down a crisp new single in exchange . " I was n't bettin ' the silver one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " It 's my good-luck piece now , " Frankie said , with a low , soft malice in his voice , " I get superstitious myself around New Year 's . " " Change it for him , " Schwiefka ordered his dealer . " Keep your muscles in your pockets , bakebrain , " Frankie answered , " I make the change around here . " Louie rose . " If I once quit a joint I never come back in it ' n neither do my friends , " he threatened Schwiefka 's purse . " Nobody sent for you in the first place , " Frankie assured him . " I sent for him , " Schwiefka decided , and reached for the bloodstainedbuck . Sparrow 's narrow hand got it first and had it pocketed by the time Frankie had pushed back his chair . " If you sent for him you deal to him , " and sent the deck flying across the board , aces and kings and deuces scattering across the floor . Schwiefka , bending heavily , went in pursuit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steep stairwell to the street . " He 's gettin ' too big for his britches , " Schwiefka complained peevishly to Louie when he 'd gotten his deck together again . " In the old days for a dealer to walk out on me like that , he would n't be dealin ' no place for life . He 'd be spottin ' pins in a bowlin ' alley ' n lucky to get that , it 'd be just ' cause I was sorry for him . " Louie was n't hearing Schwiefka . He was hearing only the dealer 's footsteps walking away with Louie 's special luck . With the dealer 's every step Louie felt one step unluckier . He had never felt so unlucky so fast in all his life . It was the sort of night he went to a dance or stuck close to the bars and would n't let himself glance at a deck or a pair of dice or a cue . Just like that , only worse . All his luck stepping down a staircase inside of the luckiest buck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' him wit ' that dirty buck , " he realized with a strange despair . Then slapped his fedora forward onto his skull and hurried after his dollar.  |p149At  the top of the stairs Schwiefka heard him call down ; they all heard him call down . " Dealer ! I want to talk to you ! " Everyone there heard Louie ask that . But not one heard the dealer reply . Then the upstairs door closed behind Louie ; and none had heard the door downstairs open at all . All heard a long , steep , waiting silence there , where the dealer and the steerer waited within the stairwell 's high-walled pit , for someone coming down to them from above . The dealer and the steerer heard the upstairs door open and close ; like a door shutting upon some long-lost argument . Both watched Louie 's lean dark figure coming down , the sparkler in his tie glinting like a one-eyed cat , one step down and one step down . He was a long dark time coming down . Laughing nervously to himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a buck fer a buck , " he repeated his offer , sticking a folded single into Frankie 's jacket pocket . " No more ' n no less . " " Do n't buckle , Frankie , " Sparrow encouraged him . If Frankie buckled now he 'd buckle for keeps , he 'd buckle in everything , the punk sensed . " I do n't want trouble , I got enough , " Frankie mumbled his apologies with all his defiance swept under . " Give him his dirty buck back , Solly . He worked for it . " Sparrow stalled , fishing for it in all the wrong pockets at once . Frankie unfolded the single just to be sure it was n't a phony . " It 's good awright , " Louie laughed , " it come from the same place as the silver buck . You give it to me yerself last week  --  remember ? " " I remember  --  ' cause it was the last one you 're gettin ' that way off me . " Wrong again , Dealer . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' N on yer knees to beg me to take your money too . " " What way , Frankie ? " Sparrow put in innocently , pretending to forget all about the silver in his watch pocket . " None of yer sheenie business , " Louie told him . " Come up , Jewboythebuck , the lucky buck . " Sparrow offered it to Louie 's reaching hand , then let it slip through his fingers deliberately and stepped back just in time to let the back of Louie 's hand whizz past his lips . " A Jew trick , " Louie laughed derisively , and the odor of violet talc touched the air . Sparrow opened the door to the alley so that he couldp150kick the coin out into the alley 's darkness if he spotted it first ; and retrieveit in the morning . Through the open door the arc lamp 's light fell across Louie 's face . Frankie felt his own back pressed hard against the hallway wall knowing neither God nor Molly-O could save him from going to Louie on his knees with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be knocked on the head , " he told Louie without hearing his own voice at all . " I want people like you knocked on the head . " " You could n't knock nobody 's head , " Louie laughed at him , " all you can knock around is that beat-out hustler John brushed off , the piece of trade with the pinned-up skirt . " Then spotted the buck , trapped upright under the door 's lower hinge , and bent swiftly for it . Frankie locked his fingers to stop their shaking . If the shaking did n't stop he was going to cry in front of the punk and a flame of cold shame for having lain in a cold and secret sweat begging for morphine charged the fingers with a pride of their own . He rose on the balls of his toes and came down with all his weight full upon that white defenseless nape . The throat made a single startled gurgle . Then the neck flopped forward like a hen 's with the ax half through it . An irregular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes till he felt Sparrow 's hand on his arm and Sparrow 's inside-info voice near at hand . " Take it easy , Frankie , we 're in the clear . " The irregular thunder became a bowling alley 's harmless roar and the lightningsteadied to the alley 's unquestioning glare . " I did n't even hear him fall , " he heard his own voice returning . " You keep sayin ' that , Frankie . Quit sayin ' that . We got to be upstairs before the aces pick him up . " " Did you run too ? " Frankie asked , feeling the first recession of the shock that had blacked him out . " Sure I run , " Sparrow reported with pride , " after I hauled him out of the hall . He 's behind Schwiefka 's woodshed , it 'll be morning before anybody spots him  --  can you handle the deck ? " " I can do anythin ' , " Frankie decided firmly . " All I need is one quick one . You think maybe it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give out awright "  --  Sparrow gave a little chortle of hoarse glee  --  " whose ticker would n't give out when a boxcar lands on the back of his neck ? "  |p151At  the bowling-alley bar Sparrow surveyed the dealer from behind his great glasses , trying to hurry him without rushing him back into panic . " He hit the floor like Levinsky , " Sparrow told him , covering Frankie 's glass with his palm . " You got to get back to the slot , Dealer . " At the prospect of returning Frankie felt something that had been holding him together open and let his stomach slip through . Sparrow saw him pale , yet kept the glass covered . " You got to make it , Frankie . " " I can make it . One more and I make it . " " One more and you 'll never make it . " Sparrow was firm . He saw Frankie 's hand tremble as he lifted the empty glass to his lips in the hope of finding one last small drop . " Steady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But what was it Louie had told Frankie ? " You 'll come beggin ' on your knees . " That was it then . The fast shuffle-off on Damen and Division and the sudden turn of mood in the back booth at Antek 's . A guy as right as Frankie letting himself get hooked on a kick as wrong as that . It was Sparrow 's turn to feel a little sick . " Stick by me , Solly , " Frankie pleaded exactly as if Sparrow had spoken aloud . " I 'm stickin ' , Frankie . " Neither looked toward the woodshed shadowed by the wall of the Endless Belt &; Leather Works as they returned down the alley through which they 'd fled . A couple of Schwiefka 's dated racing forms scurried down the alley before them , pursued by a bitter wind ; whipped past the woodshed 's corner and banked against the wood as though sent by the wind to cover something there . Neither spoke till they came to the darkened alley hall . " I hope you had sense enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly with a real sense of loss . " There was n't time for that , Frankie  --  it was pitch him by his ankles ' n run , you ought to be glad I did n't just let him lay . You were n't easy to catch . I still do n't know where you were headin ' . " " I had a place all right , do n't worry , " Frankie lied firmly . " Where the hell was I goin ' ? " he had to ask himself . Then , begrudgingly : " You done awright for once . " Outside the alley door Sparrow whispered pointedly . " I 'm glad we were havin ' coffee when that guy Fomorowski Whatever His Name Isp152got slugged next door . " He stooped , picked up a handful of Christmas Eve snow . When they walked in on the shills he shambled to the table , goggling dizzily , extending the snow and asking , " Who wants ice cream ? Awready it 's t'ree inches deep ! " " If Louie do n't come back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while Frankie , pale but steady , slid into the dealer 's slot . " You two guys gon na find yourselfs out of a good job one of these nights , treatin ' the customers like they was underground dogs . " " We 'd be cheaper off wit'out this one , " Sparrow told him . " Yeh , " Frankie backed up the punk , " this is gettin ' to be a good place to hang away from , there 's too many arguments goin ' on . " He looked around for Blind Pig as he riffled the deck . But the peddler had left in the wind and the snow . As the cards went around and around . Stash was out of the bucket and all was forgiven . There would be a dance in the hall that stood in the shadow of Endless Belt &; Leather and everyone would be there . But right from his first hour back home he began giving Violet trouble again . Something had happened to the old man in his five days at Twenty-eighth and California , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . First thing he shakes his head , No , to washing dishes after Violet had finished eating . So she cleaned them up herself and sent him down for a half gallon of beer  --  and here he comes back upstairs with nothing in his hand but five two-bit cigars and a dollar-fifty lighter . " Where 's my beer , Old Man ? " she wanted to know . But all Stash does is look about dreamily , like he thinks maybe he heard somebody ask him something , and lights up a fresh cigar . " No more day-old pompernickel , " he gave her a reply at last and before she could realize just what he meant by that there was a taptappingat the door and there was Sparrow with a blue-and-white pencil-striped mattress on his back . " Got it in the section next to the ' lectric eye-rons , " Sparrow boasted , dumping the mattress right in the middle of the floor , " just picked out the prettiest one , hauled it off the pile , told the girl I was from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away to ship to the South Side store , special order , they got up here by mistake . She 's still waitin ' for me to come back ' n get the other five . "  | " Do n't tell Zosh how you got it , " was Violet 's thought , " she 'd be so ashamed . " " Yeh . But think how proud Frankie 's gon na be , " Sparrow pointed out and turned to Old Husband . " I bought it for you , Old Man , it 's your comin ' - home present to sleep on when I got to sleep in the bedroom . I do n't want you bein ' uncomfortable on the front-room couch . " " Do n't want . " Stash kicked at the mattress petulantly . " What do n't you want , Old Man ? " Sparrow demanded to know . " You 'd rather sleep on the couch wit'out no mattress , you mean ? " " You pay board , what I want . " So that was it . Just like somebody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt he thought of walking right out and leaving Stash to try to handle Violet himself awhile . It took more than a new mattress for that . He himself was being extended beyond his own powers , he knew . " You talk like a bolt from the blue , Stash , " he counseled Old Husband , " you do n't get the idea at all . Times have changed . I live here now . You 're the boarder these days . It 's why you got to pay the rent . " Stash grappled with his truss over the heavy , bleached-out underwear , got it straight all around at last and announced firmly : " Am hoosband . You pay rent . " Violet , sprawled out on the mattress , her hands beneath her hennaed head and her legs spread a bit to explore its possibilities , rolled over and buried her face in her hands , laughter shaking her shoulders . " He says he 's my husband , " she managed to gasp , then dried tears of laughter out of her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the bedroom with a low word to the punk : " I 'll be waiting , lover . " In a minute she was back : " It 's too small for a double bed so I put it on your side  --  I got so much meat on me I could sleep on the floor ' n it 'd feel like plush  --  but your poor little bones , the way they stick out --  " " Ess , " Old Man agreed with a malicious glee , " is good enough for Mrs. No-good , on floor . " He pointed commandingly to the sports section wadded into a hole in the battered couch . " Mr. No-good there . " He got a good grip on the truss and stood right up to Sparrow . " Stash boss by liowz now . Stash sleep on bed . " " If you do n't stop tryin ' to make trouble around here you ca n't tear no more days off my calendar , " Violet told him , and went into the kitchen to see to the one small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass against the icebox door and followed . " We ca n't afford to have you drinkin ' up our good beer on us , the way you 're actin ' , " he warned Stash , " you stay out . " When Sparrow passed the bedroom door on the way downstairs for more beer he saw Stash stretched comfortably on the new mattress , working on a fresh cigar and with a half gallon all his own beside the bed . There was something wrong , Sparrow sensed , in the old man 's very posture . If he felt that relaxed today how could anyone be sure he 'd feel like getting up at 5 A.M. to go to work tomorrow ? Stash got up in time to go to work the next morning  --  but Vi had to roll out first and get the coffee perking before he did it . " We ca n't go on this way , " Violet told him in the cold little kitchen , afraid to return to bed lest he return there too . " There got to be some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Man agreed . " You go by job instead . " Sure enough , he returned that same afternoon with his rusted ice tongs over his shoulder . " Did you quit or was you fired ? " she wanted to know before he had hung up his coat . Stash made no reply . But he stayed home drinking beer the whole afternoon and in the evening Violet and Sparrow held an anxious conference in the kitchen . " He says he ai n't gon na do nothin ' but set around ' n read the temper ' - ture the rest of his life . Then he looks at the calendar like he wishes it was time awready to pull the date off for tomorrow . " " He 'll get tired of settin " n settin ' . He 'll go back to work just to have somethin ' to do , " Sparrow hoped vaguely . Old Man never wore pants or shoes or shirt about the house . ' When ready to eat he simply thrust knife and fork into the truss and sat wiggling his toes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . He broke in upon the conference , shuffled his upper plate into position and said , " Ready . " " Ready for what ? " Violet wanted to know in alarm . She had set plates for only two . Stash reached over and placed Sparrow 's plate in front of himself . " This stuff ai n't for you , Old Man , " Sparrow pointed out , " this is fresh stuff . You could n't digest it . It 'll be ripe for you tomorrow , there 'll be lots left over . " " I digest awright , " Stash assured him . " Now I 'm eat . Ever'tin ' frash . Tomorrow you eat , little bits left all over . "  |p155S|parrow  and Violet watched the old man spreading creamery butter upon fresh rolls with something akin to horror . He helped himself to her dollar-twenty-a-pound ham . " Pick the strorberries , " she commanded Sparrow , " I got to see how far this thing is going to go . " But her voice faltered . It went as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pint of whippingcream over them and lit a tailor-made cigarette out of Sparrow 's pack , left lying carelessly beside the sugar bowl . " Why do n't you finish the cream , Old Man ? " Sparrow asked . " It might go sour . " " Is for coffee , " Stash explained regally , shoving his cup toward the perking Silex . Violet filled it with a strange docility . " Now Stash gone by bed some more  --  ever'tin ' be nice , quiet , " he warned them both after the very last of the cream had gone into his coffee and the last of the coffee had gone down his throat . The fact that the right-hand button of the underwear 's trap had now loosened did n't in the least detract from the dignity of the old man 's exit . They heard the closing of the bedroom door , the sighing of the new mattress giving surcease to his brittle old bones and the first gentle snore before either dared to speak . " It looks like our move , " Violet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had returned to the front-room couch ; there was scarcely room for both of them to lie comfortably on its worn springs . " Do n't say our , " ' Sparrow reminded her , " say yours . ' You married him . " " Yeh , but I would n't have had to hang onto him this long if you went out ' n got a steady job , " she pointed out . " You could make it on the legit if you really wanted . " " Sure . I could get a Number Two shovel ' n get on a blast-furnace shift in Indiana Harbor ' n come home nights in the same shape as Stash is now ' n be snorin ' here on the front-room couch while you 're  --  " He stopped himself . " Go ahead  --  finish what you started to say . " Her eyes had darkened dangerously . " I s'ppose I 'm in heat every time I see a pair of pants hangin ' on the line ? All I think about , I guess , is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , " Sparrow thought discreetly . But all he said aloud was , " All I meant was if I had a full-time job I could n't do my fam'ly duty so good . "  | " You 're riot breakin ' no records as it is , " she assured him , " ' n anyhow I 'm not tellin ' you to start swingin ' no shovel . You could be a Western Union messenger ' n drop in to see me between messages . " " I 'd never get back to the office on time , " he predicted , " I 'd be fallin ' off the bike . Why do n't you go by Western Union yourself ? " And added silently , " Then I could rest up between messages . " " Fat chance I got of goin ' to work , " Violet complained as might any one unjustly deprived of the inalienable right to work for a living . " Who 'd take care of Zosh ' n that oversize fart hound you palmed off on Frankie ? If I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottles 'd be overflowin ' , they 'd be up to the sink . " " So long as they do n't go no higher , " Sparrow philosophized , " if they did they 'd get in the way of the dishes . " " Frankie 's got her so spoiled she wo n't even put the dishes on the sink , she waits for me to pick them up now , just like she 's tryin ' to see how much I can take off her . I 'm glad they only got one room ' cause she eats all over the place . I find dishes in the drawer , they must of been there since Frankie was in the army . " " It do n't look like you 'll have time to be cleanin ' up down there any more , " Sparrow reminded her , " the way Old Man is actin ' you 'll have to start in up here first . " " He 'll come to his senses when I wo n't let him tear the days off the calendar ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ na stop him ? " " I 'll put the calendar up where he ca n't reach it ' n lock the window so he ca n't lean out . He ca n't open it by hisself , the lock gets stuck . He has to holler for me to come unlock it . " " Do n't let him lean out too far . " " That 's what scares me , he leans out too damned far . " " Hold his legs . " " That 's the part that scares me , it 's when I 'm holdin ' his legs . What if I let go ? " " You wo n't let go . " " I know I wo n't . " " But you might forget to lock the window  --  well , I 'm glad tearin ' days off the calendar is all he wants to tear off . " Sparrow spoke with an uneasy gratitude . He was n't as certain , as he once had been , that Violet was an unmixed blessing . " Hurry up , honey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get dressed prettyp157soon ' n get down to the hall . I got to get Old Man dressed ' n shaved ' n clean socks on him . After all , the New Year 's party is for him . " " This one ai n't , " Sparrow commanded her , " quit quackin " n get to to work . " That was as far as Violet and the punk ever did get in resolving the problem of having a husband in the home . Had it not been for chance and an icy pane , old Stash might in time have driven them both to carryingmessages for Western Union . The first guest to arrive at the New Year 's Eve ball was Umbrella Man and as soon as he came in it was apparent that the occasion had been misunderstood . He carried a rebuilt umbrella " for bride-lady " under his arm , his pants were pressed and no one could convince him that it was just a coming-out party for Old Husband because Old Husband had just come out . Then Meter Reader the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Stanley Hack autographed into the leather for Sparrow ; and a book on how to throw your voice for Violet . I le pretended never to have heard of anyone called Old Husband at all and had just dropped in to kiss the bride . So all he 'd do when they tried to explain things to him was to say , " Do n't thank me , thank my boys . " So they guessed somebody had been going around saying Violet had finally divorced Old Husband at last and was getting hitched to the punk . Which , with all the presents the rumor had brought in , did n't do any particular harm . So everyone had a long pull of wisniowa on it while Stash went about showing his clean socks to everyone and pointing with pride toward Violet , to show it was Mrs. Him had given them to him . Then Antek the Owner arrived with a bruised cheek . He 'd been drinking his own whisky all day , till Mrs. Owner had locked him out in order to have something left for Monday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Married fourteen years ' n never a harsh word  --  now she bats me with the mattress board ' n locks me out of my own home . I got no home no more , fellas . I got nothin ' , it 's all in her name . Owner 's out in the cold world all alone , ca n't even get in to see his own little girl  --  is n't that a shame , fellas ? " He did n't draw a tear . Everyone knew he got maudlin as regularly as he had a good week and was locked out till he sobered up . Locking him out , after a good week , was the only thing that sobered him . Hep158had a crying need for pity and could never understand why no one sympathized with a man robbed , overnight , of wife , home , family , honor and his lifetime savings . When Owner wanted to cry , he cried , and anything at all did for an excuse . What really mattered with Owner was n't on the tongue but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his heart , he wept . " I 'm not cryin ' for my own trouble , " he confided in Frankie , leaning so heavily across the wheelchair 's arm that Frankie had to brace it with his foot to keep it from being rolled backward , " I 'm cryin ' for everybody 's . " He took off his glasses to cry the better for everyone ; for the lenses were so splashed with tears they were indistinguishable from the beads of sweat about his round bald brow . " You 're cryin ' from the skull now , Owner , " Frankie informed him . " When it starts comin ' out of your ears it 's time to use the handkerchief . " And assured Sophie from where he stood behind her , " He 'll be back behind his bar Monday morning . " They wandered in from all over the ward , the invited and the uninvited , the wary and the seeking , the strayed , the frayed , the happy and the hapless , the lost , the luckless , the lucky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if anyone were getting out of jail it must be the punk again , to congratulate Sparrow ; only to find all the more reason for celebration when they learned that , just for this once , it was n't the punk at all . Everyone got congratulated for something or other whether he deserved it or not . Everyone but Old Man , who could n't even get congratulatedon his new socks . So he tried going about announcing " Stash boss by howz " while clutching a week 's worth of calendar dates ; and still no one paid him any mind . And some came just to celebrate the season with Frankie Machine . Yes , and one blind peddler so drunk he merely sat in a corner and called out , from time to time , that he , alone of all good hustlers , had come to mourn a hustler . To mourn for Fomorowski , Blind Pig defied them all . While the whole long hall rejoiced . And Violet , finding pity at the bottom of a whisky glass , began makingevery stewbum , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old Husband first and admire his socks . Till the old man , clutching his calendar dates like so many retrieved hours , felt the party must really be for him after all.  |p159Meter  Reader kept running back and forth in the center of the floor scooping up an imaginary grounder he 'd missed in some long-gone summer 's double header . For Meter Reader did n't know a meter from an egg beater : it was only that long ago he had come into a meter reader 's cap . It had lost the insignia above the peak , but still served when he coached the Endless Belt &; Leather Invincibles . He was still trying to explain Endless Belt 's 19  --  1 loss to Lefkowicz Fast Freight and the boys were egging him on . " I 'm proud of my boys , " Meter Reader insisted , " proud of every man of them . " He still lived over that overwhelming defeat though it had been achieved on the Fourth of July and the year was running out with the hour . He still had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When Meter Reader grew excited he could n't see he was being jived a bit . The phone rang and someone said it was Owner Budzban of Endless Belt wanting to talk to his coach about spring training . Of course it was only Sparrow phoning from across the street , but the hall grew quiet so Meter Reader could hear the message better . Out of the corner of the eye everyone watched him listening so humbly , head sinking slowly in despair while the punk told him he was through at Endless Belt  --  his check would be mailed to him Monday morning . No , there was nothing wrong with his work at Endless Belt , it was just that the company could n't afford to back a losing team any longer . Feeling was running pretty strong , the boys wanted a winner this year so it had been decided to let Coach go with the best of New Year 's wishes . Meter Reader came out of the booth looking brokenhearted . Losing the job was nothing , he had held onto it only because it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " One hell of a New Year 's resolution they made there , it 's all I got to say , " he mourned . " But I seen it coming since July . Well , I 'll find something else "  --  then as if suddenly jolted by the full truth of what had happened to him he seized Frankie by the sleeve and shouted right in his ear , " I 'm proud of my boys ! Every fool man of them ! " " Meter Reader ! " someone called , " there 's a Mexican out here wants you to coach for Vera Cruz next season  --  can you talk Mex ? What should we tell him ? " ! Meter Reader , to whom all things were possible , waddled out to see what kind of offer Vera Cruz had for him . Before he reached the door the phone rang for him once more and the same voice came on again :  | " Is Owner Budzban . You could have job back but we got to get new coach . Is okay ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the booth this time refusing to talk to anyone . He got a good hold of the bar and would n't let go . It took Meter Reader some time to grow suspicious  --  but once he became so he overdid it . When the phone rang and he was told his girl was on the line he refused unconditionally to answer . For a week now he would n't be believing the simplest sort of neighborhood gossip . While Sophie sat so flushed with excitement that she looked ready to get up and start dancing herself any minute . Sparrow wheeled her under the mistletoe and kissed her , and all the boys kissed her , till it hardly felt that she was just somebody in a wheelchair at all . High atop the Christmas tree a single tinsel star looked down and Old Husband , weaving a little in the middle of the floor , pointed the neck of an empty whisky bottle at it and shouted , " Al Za start ' jestem popatrz yc na gwiazdyck . " He had grown too old to look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting arms . With Blind Pig looking up at the great load of silver icicles and artificial snow borne by the tree just as if he could see it all ; and his eyes still red from weeping . For everyone who really mattered had come by now . Chester from Conveyor , Chester from Viaduct , Oseltski from Post Office , Shudefski from Poolroom , Shudefski from Marines , Szalapski from Dairy , Widow Wieczorek and Umbrella Man 's brother , Kvorka from Saloon Street . And Sophie 's own bright little grandmother with a bottle all her very own . Everybody who counted , a few who just imagined they counted , and a couple dozen more who knew well they never had , never would , never could and had never been intended to count at all . Now began the midnight uproar to welcome the new year in . In the middle of the Swiateczyna Polka the younger couples began jitterbugging , and Sophie 's grandmother shook her wise old head to see . She liked all things young people did , so long as it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money . She liked it so well that she shook Umbrella Man awake , where he slept a drunken sleep in the chair beside her own , till he sat up and asked , " How far are we ? " And promptly returned to sleep . Violet , pickled to the point of elegance , strolled like a lady in her fancy , fancy gown , dragging cigarette butts in her train , gesturing artistically and asking everyone , " I do carry myself nice  --  do n't youp161really think ? " Right up to Sparrow to take him dancing around , singing hoarsely into his ear at every turn . " Let me tell you , laddy , Though I think you 're perfectly swell My heart belongs to Daddy , Da-a-dee , Da-a-dee , Da-a-dee  --  " At the bar there was such a crush that the liquor ran out three times and emergency rations had to be rushed in by a squad of four flying lushes . It was one of those nights when everyone felt , for some reason , he really never had to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to have a drink on everyone else . Men who would n't loan their mothers three dollars without an I.O.U . heard themselves telling ancestral foes , " Keep your money , Emil . Spend mine . I got too much . " The orchestra got tight to a man so that the drummer stood up on his traps , alleged he was Gene Krupa and wanted to buy some cigarettes , then toppled into the sax man 's lap . Immediately the sax man began taking a collection for the drummer and turned it over to the pianist . Who promptly rose to spend every dime of it back on the dancers . Frankie took over the drums . For half an hour , while everyone was helping to bring the drummer around , the dealer was a man in a dream : he was Dave Tough , he was Krupa , then he was Dave Tough again without missing a beat . " The kid can do it when he feels like it , " somebodysaid , and everyone shook his hand to tell him he was as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a deck . Cousin Kvorka held his hand last and longer than anyone . " You can do it when you want to , Dealer , " Cousin told him . " Do n't call me Dealer , ' call me Drummer , " ' Frankie asked : he never had it in him to answer Cousin in a really friendly way at all . He turned toward the bar . Cousin turned him back . " Before you start hittin ' the bottle over there I want to do you a small favor , if you 'll let me , " the leathery little man asked Frankie with real humility , " for the way you 've kept the wolves off Umbrellas at Schwiefkas , " he explained with the embarrassment of a man more accustomed to denying a favor than to be asking the privilege of doing one . " You do n't owe me no favors , Cousin , " Frankie told him with a sullennesshe could not keep out of his voice , " it 's my job to keep the gamep162straight , it 's what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal as everyone else . " Cousin had maneuvered him into the corner of the men 's wardrobe within a few steps of a couple bucks trying to start a crap game . " I would n't sleep tonight if I did n't tip you , Frankie . " Frankie had the feeling , cold and swift , that the party was over and the new year well begun . Through the hubbub and the laughter , the smoke , the music and the stomp of dancing feet , he sensed , for one moment , that 1947 was going to be a long , long year for Frankie Majcinek . " Spill it , " he told Cousin Kvorka . " When we picked up Fomorowski he been layin ' there two days ' n if some potato peddler had n't stopped by the shed to pee he might be layin ' there yet . The guy was covered up . " " You should of buried him deeper then , " Frankie suggested without troubling to feign surprise . " Why you tellin ' me ? " Kvorka bridled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dealer . " Frankie waited . " I ai n't tryin ' to make no pinch , Frankie , " Cousin assured him earnestly . " I ai n't even tryin ' to give you advice . But it would do you some good to know what the score is on Louie now . " " Sounds like the game 's over for Louie , " was all Frankie had to say . " He 's at the morgue ' n there 'll be a coroner 's inquest . I can tell you the verdict now ' cause I tossed him in the wagon myself . " It was Kvorka 's turn to wait . Either the dealer needed to know or he did n't . " What 's the story , Cousin ? " " ' Death due to assault , assailant unknown . ' His neck was broke , Frankie . " " It you ask me that 's a damned good thing ' n I 'm happy to hear it , " Frankie told him steadily . The crap game was getting well started . " Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " What do I need favors for ? " Frankie turned on his heel . What did the guy take him for ? Some high school stub who 'd break down ' n say , " Please do n't arrest me , Mister , I wo n't do it again " ? It would be a cold day in hell before Bednar would pin a rap like that on Frankie Machine . He stood watching the crapshooters until he saw Kvorka get his hat and overcoat out of the wardrobe and leave . " He could save his favors , "  |p163Frankie  repeated . Machine did n't scare as easy as some aces might think , he told himself . But when somebody offered him the dice he shook his head , No , and wandered off looking for Sparrow . He went around the hall twice and could n't spot him . Wandered without noticing that everything everyone was doing around him was the funniest sort of thing anyone had ever yet done . The hall was jumping with comical fellows wearing their girls ' best hats and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the stage . Best of all , no one seemed to mind being outdone in anything . Though each tried to outsing , outdrink and outdance the next fellow , yet between the singing and the dancing and the drinking each concededreadily he did n't do nearly as well as anyone else in the place might have . Each exhibited his humility and trust by offering his whisky , his counsel and his girl to whoever stood nearest . " Just everybody is feelin ' good tonight , " Sophie laughed , and felt just as good as anybody . Following Frankie 's circuit of the floor , she wondered who he was looking for . If it was for whom she suspected , she determined , someone would learn that it was as easy to slap a face from a wheelchair as from a standing position . Her suspicion trailed along behind Frankie as she watched him , hatless , leave the hall . For he knew where dark-haired Molly sat by herself , in the nest on the first floor front , and it was n't Sparrow he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat counting the Els that passed in the night . It was New Year 's Eve on the El , it was New Year 's Eve down DivisionStreet , it was Happy New Year 's Eve for the boys from the Tug &; Maul and the girls hustling drinks at the Safari . It was Happy New Year in Junkie Row at Twenty-sixth and California and Happy New Year for the Endless Belt &; Leather Invincibles . It was Happy New Year everywhere except in Molly Novotny 's heart ; neither her heart nor her nest gave sign of the season . The stove was smoking again and she thought carelessly , " We get the ones the landlordsbuy up for old iron , " of both the stove and her heart . The day comes when both feel past throwing heat . It 's like that for all hustlers ' hearts : to pay the most and get the worst . The only thing a hustling girl has that does n't get stopped up is her purse . And that 's as full of holes as a married man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it drew the curtain up in that same passionate fluttering that had touched her heart so strangely the firstp164night he 'd come by  --  then died , as she felt her heart had died ; and dwindled like any dying heart away . He would not be by again . She tried to rouse herself , saying it would never do , letting herself feel so useless again . She had never understood why she had lived with a man like Drunkie John , for whom she had cared nothing at all , and found the answer now : when a woman feels useless she does n't think anything of throwing herself away . One way of doing it , with one man or another , was as good a way as any other then . She ought to be hustling drinks across the street this minute instead of letting herself feel that , unless one certain clown knocked soon , she would be useless all her life . It seemed to her now that all she had ever wanted , with one man or another , one street or another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this : a man to care for , and a child of her own . To nurse in the silver evening light and tend in the gilded morning . That was all she had ever wanted . Or ever could want again . As the party down the street grew gayer and the revelry in all the bars increased , she sank into a pleasant sleep and dreamed she held somebody else 's baby to her naked breast while someone knocked and knocked at some far door and she could not answer without letting the baby go . " John is drunk and back at the door , " she counseled herself in sleep , " come to take my baby away . " She wakened in a dead-cold fright , the fire had gone out and yet the knocker rapped on through her dream . " It 's me , Molly-O , " Frankie 's unemphatic voice . " I know you 're there . I asked at the club and they said you had n't showed up . You sick , Molly ? You mad at me ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see whether it had been locked against him . Then rose at last and let him in . " He 's scared , " she thought the second she saw his face . " I 'm the girl he comes to when he 's scared . " He stood with his back against the door and he was sweating across the hair line , there were flakes of snow on the hair . " Who 's chasin ' you , Frankie ? " " The aces . They 're goin ' to pin the sluggin ' on me . " " Are you clean ? " she asked and before he had time to fashion the lie , " Do n't tell me you were n't in on sluggin ' Louie . It 'd spoil just everythin ' if you did . We been straight with each other so far  --  let 's keep it straight . The way it is with you ' n me , when it ai n't straight no morep164it 's over . There ai n't six barflies between Antek 's and the Safari who ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It ai n't that hard to guess with your buddy spendin ' like crazy . " " The punk ai n't had two bucks all his own to spend in a month , " Frankie reproved her . " What you tryin ' to hand me ? " " Just what the people are sayin ' . Buyin ' drinks by Antek like he owns the joint all yesterday afternoon . " Frankie laughed uneasily . " You did n't see no cash go over the bar , did you ? " " I was n't there , Frankie , I just heard . They do n't like it at the Safari if I hang around Antek 's too much . Where I make my livin ' is where I should spend , they think . " " Then I 'll tell you this : either the punk is spendin ' Stash 's Christmas bonus money or he 's runnin ' up a tab on Antek . Stop worryin ' . " " I ai n't worryin ' about the punk , " Molly told him gravely , " it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to the window . Between the girders of the El the snow was freezing fast . " No , I ai n't clean , " he answered with an ice-cold bitterness . " I ai n't got enough blood on my hands , I got to pull somethin ' like that . " It was n't till he 'd told her that she came to him , to link one arm into his own . " Do n't torture yourself . It 's a good thing he 's gone . I seen the way he hooked a couple of them Safari kids onto the needle . " " I do n't feel proud , like I done somethin ' so great , " Frankie told her with a grin at once both grateful and heartsore . Seeing the defeat in that smile , Molly thought , He 's going to have to run for it all right . " When you 're ready to take off I 'll take off with you , " she told him matter-of-factly . " But let 's not start runnin ' till we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game away . Let 's tough it out till it blows over a little . If we run we split it wide . Give it a chance to heal . Let them pick you up ' n haul you down to Record Head , there 's nobody around here who 'll testify up against you ' n nobody who can prove anythin ' if they did . Tough it out , Frankie . I 'll tough it with you . We 'll tough it together . " And took his tough little mug in her hands , gave him one small tough kiss and held it for luck . When she released him he grinned in the way she remembered best , with something of the old hope in his eyes . " I took over the traps for the drummer tonight , " he told her as proudly as a boy , " I did n't miss a beat the whole time . "  | " Where 'd you disappear to ? " Sophie was parked in the dance hall 's vestibule and the party was over for her too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game was over , losers and winners alike had left , the orchestra was packing its instruments and a janitor was pushing a broom down one side of the floor . All that remained of the night 's many dancers were the shadows of two drunks on the walls , clinging to each other in a freakish caricature of a dance like a couple drunken bears : Meter Reader hauling Umbrella Man around and around the hall for no reason anyone could see at all . Their shadows fell across the wheelchair 's arm like a derisive memory of all the boys she had danced with and now would dance with no more . He had n't thought she 'd noticed him slip away . " I had to see a clocker . He give me a good thing for Tropical tomorrow . An anxious wind hurried past them like the old year 's last latecomer , Umbrella Man fell to his knees within as though to beg or pray and Meter Reader hauled him across the floor by the collar with the janitor nudging both playfully at the heels across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone in all the littered corners . " It was n't so good as the dances we used to go to , was it , Frankie ? " she asked , hoping for some reason it had n't been . He tucked the blanket in about her feet without reply and wheeled her out onto the street , the chair making a tiny trail in the light new snow all the way down to Division . To be blown , as soon as they passed , into the footsteps of the night 's thousand revelers . And into their own dim hall . He shoved the chair into the alcove below the staircase and she leaned her full weight upon him for the climb . He had to hold to the railing , she had never leaned so heavily upon him . The steps rose , into a wan yellow light , more steeply for him than ever before . " Do n't lean so hard , Zosh . I ca n't hardly make it . " She lightened her weight a bit up to the second flight . There , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signal tower stood out clearly and abruptly , its red and green ornamentation glowing down the tracks like an iron caricature of the Christmas tree they had left behind in a half-lighted hall . With his arm about her they paused to see the snow falling aslant the crosslights as far as the night would let them see . To Frankie that quarter-moon sky looked darker and all the iron apparatus of the El taller then ever . The artificial tenement light seepingp167across the tracks made even the snow seem artificial , like snow off a dime-store counter . Only the rails seemed real and to move a bit with some terrible intent . " Your hands ' r so cold I can feel the ice t'rough my mittens , " Sophie told him , thrusting her damp , mittened hand out of his in a child 's sudden displeasure . So cold , so cold , hands , wrists and hearts : the old quarter-moon of the tenements shone no colder tonight than the blood crying for warmth in his wrists . And though her eyes were still bloodshot from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " You 're gon na miss your big fat mamma one of these days  --  you know why I like that song ? ' Cause it reminds me of one I really like . " In the icy dark the street lamp 's frosty glow lay like hoar across dresser and wheelchair and bed . The clock was beating out its heart on the wall in a freezing pain and the luminous Christ gleamed all around with an icy , creaking mystery . Below the crucifix Rumdum whimpered , shaking in all his limbs and pounding the floor with his whiskbroom tail in hope of some ultimate warmth . " That sneak of a hound been curlin ' up on the chair again , " she snitched on Rumdum , he had so often been warned against shedding hair anywhere in the room except on the floor . The floor was all right because there Violet would sweep it up sooner or later . " He was just tryin ' to get warm , " Frankie told her in the darkness , fumbling about the gas plate in the corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , jumpin ' off ' n pertendin ' he been under the dresser the whole time we was gone ? " " ' Cause he 's scared he 'll get rapped in the snout with the hair curler like the other time he tried it , " he reminded her . " I 'll rap him wit ' somethin ' more than a hair curler , " she warned them both , " if he got rapped wit ' a little rat poison in his dirty beer we 'd see how much sneakin ' he 'd do then . " A little blue flame spurted upward in the dark beneath Frankie 's hand . " You wanted a dog , " he told her , " you got one . " He sat on the bed 's edge and smoked a cigarette while Rumdum nuzzled between his knees . Once the latch rattled suddenly and he wondered why he could never get used to the way the El rattled it . " Wheel me a little , Frankie . " That meant she would sleep in the chair tonight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a light doze . Beside the gas plate 's feeble warmth she napped lightly , with the little blue flames playing on her nodding head ; beneath the chair Rumdum shivered . The overhanging blankets kept the cold off his hide a bit down there . From under the heaped army blankets on the bed  --  blankets stolen from army camps all the way from Fort Bragg to Camp Maxey  --  Frankie peered out , with one limp eye , upon the new year 's calendar : January 1 , 1947 . Outside the pane the year 's first snow turned into the year 's first rain . Time , Frankie saw by that calendar , was some old man with a scythe . Time was always an old man with a scythe , for some reason . Yet as he drifted toward sleep it seemed that Time was really Antek the Owner 's great gray deaf-and-dumb cat , that simply sat all day on the bar and studied the barflies with such unwavering tolerance . Everyone said the cat was dumb , all insisted he had never even been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone had heard the old cat purr . " ' N when you hear that one purr you 're through , " Antek was convinced . " That one keeps track of how many shots you put down every day . So long as you 're just a sociable drinker he do n't purr . But when you take the one that puts you on the lush for keeps , then he knows you 'll never get off the bottle all your life , ' n he purrs once at you . He purred at me ' n he 'll purr at you ' n with my own ears I heard him purr at Rumdum . " The old cat knew , Frankie realized dreamily , only the old cat knew . Watching and waiting for the finishing shot that each hustler came to with the cat-gray stroke of the years . Dreamed he heard Molly-O cry out only one flight down ; in a voice made remote by many walls . And muffled by a slow slant rain . By walls , by rain and by years to be when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slow slant rain of a night he would never know . Some rain that beat , like forgotten tears , against some other room 's single pane : the rain of that far-off night when his name would be the name of nobody at all , as the name of one who had never lived . Save in the memory of Molly-O , grown too old to remember . Caught between the dealer 's slot and the cat-gray stroke of the years , Frankie saw a line of endless girders wet with the rain of those years to be . Where all night long , in that far time , the same all-night salamanders burned . Burned just as they had so long ago . Before the world went wrong . And any gray cat had purred at all.  |p169The  cold rain ran with the red-lit rain . Like years beating by on the wheels of an empty Loopbound El . Till his heart , that cried for a greater rest even in sleep , felt tattooed by that long rain 's beating . Why was it that within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an infant 's gasping cry ? As the first light began enfolding the signal towers with tourniquets of fog , a sounder sleep finally folded a tourniquet about the fever in Frankie 's brain . The slow heart stanched itself at last ; though the rain ran on forever . And Molly-O , so far below , had yet such a long hard way to go . " Sophie knows , " he mumbled in sleep , " she knows about Molly-O , but she do n't know about everything . ' Cause the cat wo n't purr , the cat wo n't tell . Nobody can tell which way the old cat 'll jump . " And a dream cat leaped , in a slow and stiff-legged tableau , down a steep dark stair where paper daisies bloomed in an unabating rain . Two hours later he felt himself being shaken awake by Record Head Bednar 's hand on his shoulder . He opened his eyes to see only Sophie shaking him . " What 's the matter ? What 's up ? " he wanted to know irritably ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Nuttin ' , dummy , " she scolded him . " You just look too lonesome when you sleep . I do n't like it when you look so lonesome , it makes me feel lonesome too  --  I 'm here , ai n't I ? If you got to sleep lookin ' like that get u p ' n get dressed , it means you need a drink . " Then , curiously , almost gently : " Why you look like that when you sleep , Frankie ? " " Some cats just sleep like that , " he told her without hearing his own voice . He was already purring , back in dreams , among all manner of other strange lost strays . Time may well redeem the forger while leaving the bad checks unredeemedwas how Antek Witwicki looked at it . And just to show how little trust he had in Time had had a fresh challenge painted above his register for all Tug &; Maul employees to heed : I 'll cash the checks here  --  OwnerThen , reminding himself that the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ softened the alarm with a gentler admonition : He who drinks and drinks with grace Is ever welcome to this placeBut he who drinks and starts to swear Is never welcome anywhere.  |p170Antek  also expressed his faith in the high art of graceful drinking by sternly forbidding all strong-arming upon the immediate premises . " Take him out on the street , " Owner would insist , " and I do n't mean in front of my doorway neither . The city put up a billboard for that purposearound the corner . " His sense of justice was as decided as his love of graceful living . He backed up law and order with a wooden-handled plunger originally designed for the flushing of basement sewers . By reaching over the bar with the business end , to conk guilty and innocent alike , whichever happened to be nearest , he accounted for all sorts of unpaid sins . Although not so damaging as a blackjack or a rubber-handled gearshift , it was certainly more humiliating to be conked out of a tavern with a plumber 's plunger : there is scarcely more dignity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gum wrapper or a cigar band , in front of a janitor 's broom . For the more serious brawls he went for a half-filled water bucket kept below the bar with a bottle of ammonia waiting beside it . A dash of ammonia in the water and a heave of the bucket over the bar would break up anything from bulldogs to men . He had used it with savage success on cats , bulldogs , torpedoes , ex-pugs , drunken paratroopers and cuckolds demanding satisfaction from their wives ' consorts . It had worked every time . " The only thing it ai n't worth a damn on is a woman under sixty or a girl over twelve , " he conceded with some bewilderment . " We had a pair of biddies go after each other here one Easter morning  --  the one on top had her slipper off and was trying to get the other one 's eye out with the heel  --  but that one got her teeth through the cheek ' n both ' em with their Easter dresses half ripped off . The toot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her but the shoe 's boy friend hollered somethin ' so she started rammin ' the slipper up between the toot ' - holt 's legs  --  you ought to have heard the bloody screamin ' then  --  I figured it had gone far enough ' n went for the bucket ' n ammonia but it did n't help a thing . I had to cold-caulk that one wit ' the slipper . What would you have done , you was me ? " The Tug &; Maul , this winter noon , looked much as it had that Easter dawn . Frost had gathered on the windows and by night there would be neon rainbows in the snow . But , behind the piled beer cases , the same old mural took up the wall to the roof : a great spread-winged hawk painted there in descent upon one stuffed and helpless Christmas duck . The stuffing had been packed into the poor bird to the bursting point , itp171hung upon invisible wires . How it had ever gotten off the ground in that shape the artist had not so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fowl 's head hung , forever , the great obscene claws of the descending killer . It too seemed suspended upon invisible wires . Frankie Machine sat on a beer case listening to Meter Reader trying to establish credit with Antek without first settling his Christmas-week tab . " I never let the same guy hook me twice , " Antek explained . " I 'll take it once . That 's all . " " You 're a better man then than Jesus Christ , to hear you talk , " Meter Reader reproved Antek irritably . " He turned the other cheek , but that ai n't good enough for you . " " He did n't turn it , that 's where you 're wrong , " Antek informed Meter Reader . " He run the bankers out of the temple with a whip  --  you call that turnin ' the other cheek ? " " That was different , they was Jews . " Meter Reader was growing excitedwith his need of a double shot . " ' N I 'm the guy who can tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once ? He told me , Your best friend is the dollar . ' What do you think of that ? " " It was a Polak told me that , " Antek differed calmly . " My old lady , in fact . ' N she did n't turn the other cheek neither . " Frankie Machine witnessed Meter Reader 's defeat without interest : he was feeling like the duck on the wall overhead . A half gallon of Schlitz stood between his knees , it was nearly noon and he 'd been waiting for the punk almost an hour and no sign of him yet . The punk was getting too independent , for some reason . Antek ambled over to where a girl , with a bottle of cream soda on the table before her and a shopping bag in her hand , sat waiting for some drunk with his head on the table . Husband , brother , father or friend , she was waiting for him to come to his senses and it looked like a long , long wait . Antek shook the fellow but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grin for reply ; the fellow seemed hopelessly drunk . " Get him out of here , " Owner ordered the girl . " Why pick on us all the time ? " she wanted to know . For there were equally hopeless drunks sleeping it off on either side of her . " Because he did n't get it in here is why , " Antek explained . " I take care of my own customers . They could sleep here all day ' n half the night if they want . But I ai n't in the samarathon business , takin ' care of stiffs who get it somewheres else . Leave him sleep it off where he bought it . "  |p172Recognizing  the essential morality of this point of view , she bent forward and with a single finger tapped her companion below the elbow . Though he had hardly sensed Owner 's heavy-handed treatment at all , he rose automatically at that light touch , wiped his nose on his sleeve and told himself thoughtfully aloud : " The question got to be settled this Sunday . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valve caps on me again . Why do they keep playing the same record all the time ? " And went for the door like a sleepwalker without even pausing to see whether the girl , whatever she was to him , was still with him or not . How any man could find any door in such a stupor there was no way of telling  --  but he made it with the girl on his heels and right there she turned , stuck out her tongue at Antek and told him obscurely : " That 's for short measurement , " and was gone , shopping bag , cream soda , zombie and all , to the very first bar that would let the pair of them sit around out of the cold and the wind and the wet for a little half hour or two . Frankie watched Antek 's second triumph in as many minutes with an eye turned inward upon a sea of faces , like faces borne on a shoreward tide . Cousin Kvorka 's moonlike mug , full of a clumsy yet gentle anxiety , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Record Head Bednar 's harassed face , brooding under its shaggy brows , looking like that of a man who has acted so heroically all the days of his life that he no longer has enough courage left to get him through the nights ; Sophie 's eyes , full of a pale suspicion ; Sparrow 's intense , peaked and eager look wanting to tell him something and being somehow afraid to say it and then smiling with Nifty Louie 's thin , disdainful smile as though to say , " You do n't have the whole story yet , Dealer . " Molly Novotny 's face , full of a dark and steady appeal , upthrust trustingly to his own . There was something had to be straightened out with the punk before he could take off with Molly . That punk was n't helping matters much , if what Molly said was true , buying people drinks and everyone knowing the kind of wad Louie had carried . How many people had Louie counted out his money for before he 'd counted it out for the punk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's money that night . " How come I 'm never around when he 's doin ' the buyin ' ? " Frankie asked himself broodingly . The punk was going to have to be straight/ened out all right , this business about Louie looked like it might not blow over for three weeks yet . So first of all he 'd have to get straight himself . He motioned to Antek for a double shot to start getting straight on right away . For way down there , in a shot glass 's false bottom , everything was bound to turn out fine after all . Bednar was certain to find that death at the hands of person or persons unknown actually meant death due to causes unknown ; so that it did n't really matter after all . Any more than it would matter after he and Molly Novotny had gone away together . Vi would take good care of Zosh then , till Zosh was back on her feet again and married to some fellow , some sort of doctor , who 'd take better care of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while there 'd be hardly any hard feelings left at all and he and Molly would go to visit Soph and this real good guy she 'd married and they 'd all wish each other good luck and really mean it . He finished the shot and tried to remember : What was it he had had to worry about ? He had the situation beat and it had n't been as tough as he 'd thought it was going to be . He motioned to Antek with the shot glass and Antek brought over the bottle to save shoe leather . Sparrow shuffled in and stood in the doorway trying to locate someone in the dimness . Frankie could see him clearly against the light from the street but did not call out . He sat and studied , one minute , this alley nomad with the forehead so high it looked capable of holding everythingwhile all that ever actually sank into it were blows . It was time to check up on the punk . As he came toward the back Sparrow 's eyes searched furtively along the bar rail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think you 're still in the junkin ' stage , " Frankie greeted him with a calculated scorn , " spyin ' for dimes along the bar rail , you must be down to your last nickel . " " Who wants to be rich ? " the punk evaded him . " You think I want to be the richest guy in the cemetery ? " " How come when you 're with me you 're always broke ' n the other times you 're buyin ' the drinks ? " Frankie put it bluntly . " It ai n't just when I 'm wit ' you I 'm broke , " the punk assured him lightly , squatting down across the table from the dealer , " it 's all the Itine . " " That ai n't the way I heard it . They tell me you 're spendin ' awfulp174easy these last couple days . Did one of them easy bucks have a little blood on it , Solly ? " For one moment Sparrow did n't really seem to get it : his jaw hung slack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he answered in a mumble without meeting Frankie 's eyes at all . " I had a couple bills Wednesday night but you was n't around . It was Stash 's Christmas bonus check ' n me ' n Vi was lookin ' for you to help us tear a hole in it . We come in here lookin ' for you ' n we drank half of it up waitin ' for you . You think I 'd be drinkin ' Louie 's bloody bucks up in here ? " His eyes met Frankie 's at last . And demanded an answer in turn . " I 'm just askin ' whose dough you 're spendin ' , " Frankie heard himself apologizing and felt dismayed : he 'd backtracked to everybody for years but never before to the punk . " Whose dough you think I was spendin ' ? " Sparrow had the offensive at last . Everyone else made Frankie buckle  --  why should n't he ? Sparrow thought excitedly . " I thought maybe Antek was givin ' you credit again , " Frankie said weakly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tab on Owner these days , " Sparrow pursued his victory . " You want to start a new one wit ' him now ? I 'll call him over . " It looked like Frankie had not only been outmaneuvered but was goingto buy the drinks to boot . He pushed the bottle toward Sparrow and while the punk drank alone the dull drums of suspicion began beating another tune . Between the fumes of whisky there he began probing into darkened corners , like a man looking for a lost coin in an unlit steam room with the heat on full . Yet could n't quite touch anything that felt real for all his probing . " I 'll tell you somethin ' now , " Sparrow decided after finishing a secondshot , apparently not even noticing that he was drinking alone . " Pig is settin ' by the Safari in a new suit ' n really buyin '  --  how come he could n't even get in there by the front door before ' n now it 's like he owns the joint ? " " What good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked foggily . " Who 'd give him a square count ? He would n't know if he had forty bucks ' r four hundred . " " Owner 'd give him some kind of count , Frankie , " Sparrow decided . " You want to ask Owner if he give Pig a square count ? " " Do n't pertend to be that dizzy , " Frankie scolded him hotly . " Don'tp175think that dizzy act can get you out of everythin ' . I know you better than you know yourself . " " All I want to know is this , " Sparrow asked quietly , with no further dizziness at all . " Who 's wearin ' the new suit  --  me or Piggy-O ? " " That does n't prove much , " Frankie grumbled ; but this time he filled both glasses . Then shifted his cigarette to the corner of his mouth till it dangled and Sparrow realized swiftly , " Now he 's gettin ' set to pull one of his corny movie acts on me . " Frankie passed his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it when they were hunting him down and he needed a shave . Somebody had squealed , that was it , it was between himself and Edward G. Robinson now . " We could go look for Pig in the Coney Island Diner , " Sparrow suggested , for he dearly loved this movie game . Like the reading of serial numbers on streetcar transfers , it was one game he played faster than Frankie . " What 's the use of goin ' to the Coney ? You said he was at the Safari . " " That 's just why we should go to the Coney , ' cause he wo n't be there . We just come in ' n look around at the menu ' n when the counter guy asks what do we want we tell him somethin ' that 's crossed out . " " I do n't get it . " " You just do n't see the right movies then . We ask the counter guy what people do in this town ' n then you say , They come in here to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smart boy ? ' " " Does Pig eat there now ? " Frankie was at sea and not even drifting . " Forget it , " Sparrow told him , " I 'm just too educated for you . We can pick up Pig at the Safari if there 's somethin ' you want to see him about . You sure you want me along ? " " You 're just the guy I want along , " Frankie assured him . " I 'd like to have a cam'ra ' n just go around gettin ' pictures when Nomethin ' big happens , " Sparrow began daydreaming innocently as they came out on the street , but Frankie dismissed his innocence . " You may Ix the richest guy in the cemetery yet , " he warned Sparrow . They found Pig at the Safari with his face shaved and washed , a new haircut and wearing a new suit and new shoes . The suit was already crumpled about the thighs and the shoes were two-tone jobs such as Louie once had worn ; but it was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoking a cigarette through a holder.  | " Waitin ' for a live one , Pig ? " Pig smiled straight ahead with nothing abject in his smile at all . " Yeh . Who you guys waitin ' for ? A dead one ? " His humility was gone with his half lisp . He talked like a man in the driver 's seat with one foot on the brake . " Bring it to the table , " Sparrow told the bartender , preceding the peddler to the rear with Frankie following . In the corner , beneath a frosted bulb , Pig sat looking out upon that dark and wavering shore which only the eyeless may see and only the dead may wander . " They tell me you 're in the bucks these days , Peddler , " Frankie attackedhim directly . " I know who you guys are , " Pig informed them in a dead-level tone . " Of course you do , " Sparrow agreed . " I 'm the steerer ' n my buddy 's the dealer , he got somethin ' he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guys awright , " Pig told them both in that same flat knowingvoice . Now it was time to say : " You heard Louie get slugged . Heard us run and tapped down the alley till the odor of violet after-shave talc hit you . You touched him where he lay , bent above him and found the heavy roll you 'd heard him bragging about half an hour before . Then pushed a few papers above him and tapped away to someone who 'd give you a square count . " But there was no way of asking a thing , it dawned on Frankie at last , without betraying himself . As if sensing Frankie 's thought the blind man told him , " I believe in live ' n let live , Dealer . Nobody asks me questions , I do n't ask nobody questions . I got to live too . " His fingers found Frankie 's knuckles and touched a ring , of heavy German gold , that Frankie had worn since returning from overseas . " I ai n't no big snitch , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't put no finger on me . It 's just live ' n let live , how I look at it . " " I think you got a good sense of direction some nights all the same , " Frankie told him , but Pig did n't seem to hear . " I 'm just one more poor blind bummy peddlin ' pencils , " he mourned , " just a poor old down-'noutbummy ' n you two guys muscle me back in some corner ' n talk like I got to watch my step , like I 'm some guy killed some guy ' r somethin ' . A blind guy could n't even rob nobody , he would n't know who was a-watchin ' . " Suddenly he lolled his tongue at them both : he 'd been laughing at them the whole time he 'd been pleading.  |p177Noiseless  laughter . Yet he laughed long . While Frankie watched , unable to move . Spittle flecked Pig 's lips . And still he had not finished . " You guys , " he regained his breath at last , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fool me , I 'm too ignorant . You gon na break my neck too , you guys ? It hurts my feelin 's , how you talk to me . Why do n't you buy me a drink ' n talk nice  --  a good drink  --  ' n then let me alone . Ai n't I lettin ' you guys alone ? Okay , you guys ? " He thrust one hand before him , knowing it would not be shaken . That was like him : to seek some humiliation that flicked the long-dying membrane of his eyes and so pleased the twisted spirit . To feel that inner vindication , as of insult upon injury . Sparrow tapped Frankie 's shoulder and nodded toward the door . " We ca n't set here all day wit'out buyin ' the bummy a drink , Frankie . " Pig heard them leaving and called out eagerly , knowing his voice would be ignored as surely as his hand , " You guys ! Buy a drink ! I 'm waitin ' for that live one ! " At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward them across the street a well-dressed matron minced through the sunlit traffic 's wintry bustle . " I 'd like to be a tradewind ' n blow clown there . " Sparrow watched her with his lewd little eyes while a lewd wind whipped her skirt . " You see her give me the eye ? I bet if a guy had a Lincoln Park yacht ' n a captain 's outfit he 'd get all he wanted . " Frankie spun him about with both hands . " If I was sure it was n't Pig that rolled Louie you 'd get all you wanted awright . If it was n't him it was you ' n that 's a lead-pipe cinch . " He shoved Sparrow away from him . " God help you , punk , if it was . " " I 'd be the richest guy in the cemetery then for sure , eh , Frankie ? " Sparrow goggled up at Frankie dizzily . That was the last sad afternoon that the dealer and the steerer sat togetherto pretend things were as they once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wavered , then slanted and darkened across the floor and right outside the ice creaked once , for the puddles were freezing over in alley and street again and Frankie himself felt half frozen . He always felt half frozen of late . Sparrow leaned across the same table at which they 'd begun the afternoon , trying to beguile Frankie away from his concern for a dead man 's bankroll.  | " Wolfin ' is just like dog stealin ' , Frankie , " he confided earnestly the minute they had returned to the Tug &; Maul . " You find out where they live ' n wait till they 're on the loose in the back yard . " " I like a dame with them glasses with the string on , " Frankie concededreluctantly , " it 's dainty-like . " " You know the kind I like , Frankie ? The Bette Davis kind  --  you know , with them real poppy eyes . " " What 's so hot about poppy eyes ? " Frankie felt irritable . " I know one with poppy eyes ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one with a goiter the size of this bottle ? " " I do n't mind poppy-eye goiters , Frankie . " Sparrow 's enthusiasm picked up a phony momentum . " I 'd like a poppy-eye on that Lincoln Park yacht  --  it do n't even have to have no engine , just have it settin ' there to point out to the chicks we 're walkin ' through the park , accidental-like  --  Oh , there 's our yacht , the crew must of brought her in from Belmont Harbor '  --  ' n when they do n't believe it we walk ' em right on board . " " You take the one with the goiter , " Frankie decided firmly , going up the gangplank without looking back . " Once they 're on board they got to stay all night , " Sparrow revealed . So Frankie drifted with him , borne by Old Forester , out of the Lincoln Park lagoon onto shoreless waters while Sparrow gestured unobtrusively for two more beers . " We 'll drift right out into the lake , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waves ' dreaming motion ; for one moment , behind that curtain , his eyes surveyed Frankie with the hard cold gleam of understanding . Only to soften as the glasses were refilled . " Maybe we better stay in the lagoon , " Frankie cautioned himself in a faraway voice , " account of havin ' no motor we might not get back to shore in time . " " In time for what , Frankie ? " " In time for everythin '  --  I do n't know  --  some-thin ' might be goin ' on on land , events might be happenin " n we 'd be elsewhere . " " We could tell the chicks we 're offshore anyhow , Frankie . " " That 's right . ' Cause it 's dark ' n they got to take our word . I point to the lights along the drive ' n tell ' em : Now we 're passin ' Michigan City . " N when we pull past the pier I say , Look , you  --  Duloot ! " N all the while we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's just the little waves lappin ' , we 're only two blocks away from the zoo so 's we can always get back in time . "  | " In time for what , Frankie ? " " I do n't know . In time to see ' em feed the lions , I guess . " He had drifted so far out Sparrow saw it was time to tow him in . " What if they hear them lions roarin ' for their breakfast ? " he asked . " Do n't they know it ai n't Duloot we 're passin ' then ? " " Tell ' em they 're sea lions . It 's time for breakfast anyhow , so we got to get rid of ' em . We say we 're back in port ' n got to turn the boat over to the crew to get it remodeled right away , the engine 's missin ' . We cluck the chicks through the underpass . " " How many chicks , Frankie ? " The punk felt reluctant to duck so fast . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  one a blondie ' n one kind of redheaded . " " Who 's the blondie for , Frankie ? " " For you . One more redhead 'd kill you . ' R maybe she 's dark , one of them with one of them real nice protudering Hottentot behinds . " " Not all them dark ones got protudering behinds , " Sparrow put in cunningly , " look at that little Molly-O , she 's trim as a policeman 's whistle . " Frankie pushed his glass away for reply . He wanted that same Molly so badly his throat felt parched . But if the punk thought he was getting anybody 's goat he 'd find Frankie did n't bite that easy . " I 'm through lushin ' for today , " he announced . " You want to go by Thompson 's ' n get two meals on one ticket , Frankie ? " " I ai n't hungry . " " How about a show then ? We got to do somethin ' if we ai n't gon na It here ' n @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pilsudski ? " " The Pilsudski smells of sheenies ' n the Pulaski smells of Polaks , " Frankie complained , trying not to see the terrible emptiness of the glass in front of him . " Excuse me , " Frankie begged the punk 's pardon , I did n't know there was a sheenie in the house . " " Excuse me , " Sparrow begged politely in turn , " I did n't know there was a Polak . You want to go dog-stealin ' , Frankie ? " " You that broke ? " " Just to do somethin ' , Frankie . Just to pacify the time . If we do n't we 'll get stiff , it would n't be no good if Kvork had to pick us up when we were stiff . By the time we got sober we 'd be puttin ' the finger on ourselves . " " That 's all blowed over , " Frankie decided . " The cops pick up stiffsp180like Louie every day . Their tickers go bad is what happens . A guy like Louie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He just clunked out . It 's all in the day 's work for Record Head . " " He did n't have a relative to claim him is right , Frankie , " Sparrow counseled Frankie , " but he owed more guys money than there are bottles on that bar . ' N every one of ' em plays ball with the super . " Sparrow looked disconsolately into his glass and whimpered , " I wisht you had n't slugged nobody , Frankie . " " ' N I wish you 'd of had the brains to grab the roll when I did ' stead of leavin ' it to Pig to tap out . " Keeping his eyes on the punk . The punk 's eyes never wavered . " If I had we 'd both we wearin ' new suits now , Frankie . " He was n't being caught off base that easily . The punk was getting too smart these days , that was all there was to it . Another week and he 'd be as smart as Frankie Machine . " Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Just for the old fun . " Frankie was firm . " No percentage . I do n't want no janitor takin ' potshotsat me . Where 's the payoff ? " " Then let 's put on our ties ' n go down to the Rye-awlto . " " Frankie tapped his glass . He could n't get it filled at the Rye-awlto . " You want to go plain-stealin ' then , Frankie ? " " Why you always so hungry to latch onto somebody else 's gold ? Stealin ' what ? " " ' Lectric eye-rons by Nieboldt 's , it 's where they 're makin ' profits to galore these days , they 'll never miss a couple eye-rons more ' r less . ' N there 's nobody around on the third floor , it 's what they call the honor system so they do n't have to hire no help . That 's the beauty part , you just help yourself , it 's better'n boozin " r wolfin ' in hallways even . " " I 'd do better to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Frankie murmured , with no intention of working off his beer paunch at all . " What you get for them eye-rons ? " " A fin apiece anywheres . It 'll kill the old monotony . After all , God hates a coward . " " Well , " Frankie conceded , " God hates a coward awright  --  but empty your pockets all the same . The only way I go boostin ' is empty-handed . " And thought , " If God hates a coward that much he must be workin ' up one terrible grudge against me  --  I 'm gettin ' so I 'm afraid to be alone with a bottle . " He finished the beer before him , wavered one moment on the Nieboldt plan  --  then the booze left in the bottle felt riskier to him than electric irons . " Let 's go , punk . "  |p181He  was mildly surprised to see that , out of nowhere , the punk was suddenly carrying a shopping bag ; it had n't been in view the whole afternoon . " What makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scolded him . " I always carry a shoppin ' bag , " Sparrow assured him brazenly , " in case I run into some guy who wants to go ' lectric-eye-ron-stealin ' by Nieboldt 's . " The after-Christmas remnants had been piled in disarray upon every counter . The tidy little beribboned gift packages were all gone and in their places were hastily stamped placards : Marked Down for January Clearance . And in the aisles half the women of the Near Northwest Side jostled one another just to see how much they would have saved if they had n't done their Christmas shopping till now . Slips , bras and pajamas were heaped as if ready to be swept into the alley if not sold before closing time . Frankie and Sparrow took the faintly murmuring escalator up to the third floor , where the punk became diverted by some marked-down toy automobiles . Frankie hauled him forward . " Let 's pick up them eye-tons . " The punk led the way a few yards , pausing only to inspect a vegetablebin at the base of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchenware , crockery and paints ; till they came to an oasis of fluorescent light wherein , it appeared , the store had forbiddenall its help to enter . Not a salesgirl in sight . " It 's Everybody 's on His Honor System , ' Frankie , " the punk felt obliged to explain the miracle , " even me ' n you . " Frankie covered , holding the handle of the bag , while Sparrow loweredhalf a dozen irons into it . When Frankie felt their weight pull on the handle he turned away , leaving the punk standing with an iron in each hand  --  he got rid of them as suddenly as though they were heated . ' Vt ' ll take the elevator down , " Sparrow urged him , " it looks so inno-cent-like . " " Escalator is the best , " Frankie decided , and Frankie always decided right . You could n't get out of an elevator fast . Ile looked around and saw Sparrow back at the refrigerator , examining the vegetable bin ; the punk caught up with him at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaks a little faster in January , " he apolo/gized , before Frankie could start scolding , " that 's the time of year I first started gettin ' dizzy when I was a sprout . " At the top of the second flight the bottom dropped out of the bag . Frankie watched them tumbling down the narrow escalator stairs as if they were on rollers and wanted to laugh when one barely missed a salesgirl 's ankle  --  the bag slipped from his hand , he shouldered the girl to one side , saw her mouth widen with indignation and then knew it was no use running , no use at all : two floorwalkers , a house dick and a dozen bosomy saleswomen clamored around , pecking at him like overfedhens . " They had an ace hidin ' in the drapes , " Frankie realized wryly , " the punk caught somebody 's eye foolin ' wit ' that vegetable bin . " And told the house dick quietly , " Let 's go where we 're goin ' . " They came down that littered aisle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his belt from behind and a floorwalker on either side holding his arms and the bosomy biddies following behind , cackling as they came . Under their feigned horror Frankie heard their easy laughter . He caught a glimpse of a butcher holding a broken-necked rooster , both butcher and rooster sliding one limp dark eye sidewise at him as he passed . He felt the patrol car wheel out from the curb and saw the wan early January sun lying in a checkered pattern across the car 's scarred floor . It was evening , the snow was drifting a bit toward the curbs and when the car stopped for the lights he heard the wind getting up all down the trolley tracks trying to hurry the patrol along a bit : it would be long melted before he saw any trolley run again . " The punk saw that ace ' n ducked without givin ' me the word , " Frankie decided bitterly . " If I ever find out for sure it was him rolled Louie  --  " He touched his left hand to his shoulder : in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . The young men had engraved their bitterest disappointments upon the walls beside their fondest hopes . They had exposed their betrayers there , mocked their lawyers and doubted their wives . One had assured his sainted mother he was going straight the moment he could make bail and with the same stub end planned straight mayhem , the moment bail was made , upon one Crash Kolkowski . No reason was offered ; yet the emergency stood plain : If it was n't for Crash Kolkowski I would n't be in here and where he should be is in hell with his back broke . Every time he comesp183around shooting off that big flannel mouth us good guys should get together and break his back five or six times . Nobody should even buy him a shot . The prospect of Kolkowski sweating out an eternity with his spine in a cast while all the good guys in purgatory stood around refusing him just one small snort was sufficiently dismal . Yet even sadder , it seemed to Frankie Machine , was another second guesser 's plea : Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary prepared the sodium amytal the night before ? Or was it only that the coils had n't been cleaned ? A deed premeditated by midnight and executed with deadpan deliberation in the dangerous noon ? Or some casual midweek evening 's error achieved in innocent merriment ? Upon the gray confessional of the walls Frankie Machine found no answer at all . With tedious attention to detail someone had illustrated precisely how a certain aging judge would look , gavel in hand , wearing nothing lout high-button shoes and a flowered cravat , while sentencing a sensibly clothed civilian to the electric chair for indecent exposure : a single button had been found loose upon the offender 's fly . To leave nothing to the imagination the chair , sizzling invitingly , had been sketched in beside his honor . To show how no time was lost , locally , in appeals for pardon , parole or probation , the judge had his hand in reaching distance of the switch and was sweating with impatience to fry this miserable joker personally . There would be no commitation of sentence here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One could see that at a glance : not a single finger of scorn was pointed at the judge for his own nakedness . Indeed the Irony of It All had inspired another amateur to scratch a second portrait : a beat-out , tattered , crooked-limbed wreck , groping in two directions at once and captioned Chicago Justice Deaf Dumb Blind and Falling Apart . In for a bum rap , one hand explained , I never rolled a drunk in mylife . While another commented knowingly : In for a bum rap too I never rolled a sober one . That 's how it is , another had confided , when you hit some lousy bum the dough falls out of his pocket and you get the blame.  |p184By  the yellow night light 's glow Frankie saw how the four walls , as well as the floor  --  and by some frenzied acrobatics the very ceiling  --  recorded with equal fame the damned and the saved : those who would surely ascend the golden escalator reserved for good guys and their truebluepals , the real sports and square johns capable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rusty freight elevator clanking miserablydownward forever would go all copper johns , double clockers , lush workers and mush workers , deadpickers and turncoats , rats , pigeons , stooges , short faders and crap catchers , deadheads and deadbeats who had ever stood drinks for Kolkowski , loaned him a dollar or applauded that big flannel mouth . Frankie could smell the walls . They were closer now than they had ever been ; they bent together above him till the door seemed a part of the walls . Walls which revealed that , by and large , the young men preferred the simple , **26;4401;TOOLONG take-it-or-leave-it sort of warn-ing : All cops are stoogesNever rat on a palGet a steady job and stay home nights and keep off N. Clark . While at the very bottom of the cell some latter-day Moses had written off all preceding commandments : Everybody shut up . If you were any good you would n't be in here . In the growing light the wall legends continued like the continuation of a dream begun in another place : the legends that follow upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cell to cell and jail to jail , linking seas to cities and cities to plains , down the streets of all the world wherever a thief stands waiting behind steel bars and a turnkey waits by the wall . In one corner some repentant bravo had inscribed a prayer for the salvation of all such sinners as himself , recommending them to John 3:7 , P185and adding piously that he 'd leave his body to the Board of Health and his ivory-tipped cue , locked in the middle rack at Spongy Kaplan 's Snooker Palace and Pool Parlor , to Hines Memorial Hospital , providing such sacrifice would bring just a bit more sunshine into the lives of his fellow men . Have Doc Bunson call for my body personlly , this soldier of the Lord had directed in a testament above the water bucket , He is a personl friend of mine and no autotopsy is necessry . While dated in the same week some revived will to live and still to do great deeds had come into the same wavering hand . Couched there in formidable obscenities the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old man 's house to the ground within the hour he made the street and found the matches ; adding an invitation to all rogue males within the city limits to enjoy his wife 's favors on their first night out of the clink . My wife only sleeps with her friends and she do n't have a enmy in the world . Call her at Madison 1-6971 and have yourselfs one hell of a time . The tramp married me for my alotment and my old man and her played the horses on my cash 19 months while I got scabies for my country overseas . Now I 'm headed for almoney row my old man &; that tramp still playing them on my dough I cant even get a winner off her she just gives them to the old man I can go scratch my dirty scabies and she says thats my todays hot tip for you soldier  --  How you like them onions ? Whether anyone like them onions or not , there they were , all ready for peeling . Frankie rolled over onto his side to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be some drawings of women there . But any one side of any jailhouse wall is never much different than any other side . There are only the same old threadbare variations on the same age-old warnings against all the well-tried ancestral foes : whisky and women , sin and cigarettes , marijuana and morphine , marked cards and capped cocaine , dirty laughter and easy tears , engineered dice and casual disease , bad luck and adultery , old age and shyster lawyers , quack doctors and ambitious cops , crooked priests and honest burglars , lack of money and hard work . Girls who would and girls who would n't . If they did they were no good and if they did n't what good were they ? One biographer wanted to know and another replied smugly : All women are deseasedYet went on to offer consolation for this blow : We 're all victims of circumstanceAnd for further consolation to all of Circumstances ' victims : Drink Dr. Jesse Blue 's bay rum and get six monthsP186While another hand countermanded all preceding instructions by commanding everyone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a jailbird , one bird of passage mourned , Give me wings ' n I 'll fly out . The only bird that flies out of here is a pigeon , another pointed out . Held Fri. 9 pm to Tuesday showup 96 hours , some green youth protested . This place gives me the baloney blues , yet another complained . America the Anti-Christ Nation , one announced obscurely . Never again , one promised forever . Frankie examined the myriad dates , initials , and hearts pierced by a hundred unkept vows . Melancholy memories of men who had since gone down the city 's thousand ways like sparks off a State Street trolley , leaving only these few poor scribblings to prove it had not been , after all , but a nightmare within a nightmare . Frankie searched carefully , hoping to find the name or initials of someone he knew or fancied he once had known . But the single arrestingdetail he discovered was a woman 's scratching , accomplished with a hairpin or barrette and almost obliterated with time , from years when the tier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is always hell She 's always living in a cellSigned , one could see through the grime , painstakingly ; certain that this inscription was all she would ever have to bequeath to all good hustlers who were to follow : Lucille just a hard-luck bitchWhat had become of sweet Lucille ? Frankie wondered wistfully . And what was to become of Frankie Machine ? Had unbearable bad luck taken her , as it seemed by way of taking him , for a long slow walk down a short and downhill pier ? Or had it changed strangely , as his own was bound soon to change , just in the nick of time , on the night she 'd met the Salvation Army drummer whose old man owned a Florida dog track ? Had they truly reformed each other then ? Had they , too , found , like Mr. and Mrs. Francis Majcinek would someday find , that everythingturns out right after all ? As everything always does ? Had thep187dream man found his dream woman had n't , somehow , been soiled by a thousand and one nights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a million dollars really made a difference in the end ? Had it really ended like all good double features ought ? Good luck or bad , faithless or true , Lucille was gone with the Pulaski 's tenderest close-ups , accompanied only by last night 's slenderest shadows . And the dead-cold fog of North Clark Street through which she tapped on through the mists of nights no man remembered . Along the tier a hundred thieves argued in sleep with unseen turnkeys : the unseen pokies of all thieves ' dreams who stride , jangling the special keys to each thief 's private nightmare , down all the lonely corridors of despair . There was no delivery from the dead end of lost chance . No escape from the blue steel bars of guilt . Somewhere far above a steel moon shone , with equal grandeur , upon boulevard , alley and park ; flophouse and penthouse , apartment hotel and tenement . Shone with that sort of wintry light that makes every city chimney , standing out against it in the cold , seem a sort of altar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadow played ceaselessly , as it had played beneath so many long-set moons , for so many that had lain here before Frankie : the carefree and the careful ones , the crippled and the maimed , the foolhardy phonies and the bitter rebels ; each to go his separate way , under his own private moon . Against a driving sky . Upon the walls , as morning moved from the women 's tiers down to where he lay , Frankie fancied many shadows : of Blind Pig with his cane stuck under his armpit ; of Sparrow shuffling along with a shoppingbag in his hand ; of Sophie wheeling toward him and Nifty Louie , ! lead hanging loosely , walking in sorrow away from everyone . Antek the Owner bent over his bar as if in prayer ; Zygmunt the Prospector countingall his money ; and Record Head Bednar studying two strays across his desk as if to say : " I figured you two 'd be back . " Saw again the green baize table as it had been the night of the argumentover the soiled silver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silk bag in one hand and the other extended toward Frankie for his take . Yes , and behind Schwiefka , Bednar 's shadow waiting foreverfor his take of Schwiefka 's take . Frankie Machine was n't happy ; yet Frankie was n't too sad . He felt oddly relieved now that , for a while at least , all things would be solved for him . There was nothing he could do now about Sophie , nothing hep188could do about Molly , nothing he could do about boozing . Not a thing he could do about hitching up the reindeers for a sleigh ride through drifting snow . " It 'll be my chance to kick the habit for keeps , " he realized . Caught between the wheelchair and the first floor front , between Old Crow and a little brown drugstore bottle , between his need for Molly Novotny and his need for the man with the thirty-five-pound monkey on his back , the dealer had found an iron sanctuary . " When I get out I 'll be straight as a cue , ' n Molly-O ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our lives ' n everythin ' on the legit , " Frankie assured himself . And meant every word of it , too . It was during that loneliest of all jailhouse hours , the hour between chow time and Lights-On , when empty pie plates stand in a double row , one or two before each cell waiting for a trusty to return them to the kitchen . Those within the cells slept the uneasy evening sleep till a buzzer sounded a measured warning and the sleepers wakened . Then all said at once that there , out there , just the other side of the green steel door , the snickerers were coming in . To accuse someone of everything and almost everyone of something and snicker at everyone in between . A holiday air seemed suddenly to festoon the tier , as if a play for which all had rehearsed many times was to have an audience on the other side of the footlights at last . No one seemed worried about catching a finger out there . Everybody was in on a bad rap so how could anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in darkened rows , to identify the man who 'd slugged the night watchman and the one who 'd snatched the purse through the window of the moving El ; for he who 'd chased somebody 's virgin daughter down a blind alley or forged her daddy 's signature ; tapped a gas main or pulled a firebox ; slit the janitor 's throat in the coalbin or performed a casual abortion on the landlord 's wife in lieu of paying the rent . All the things that had to be done to help someone else out of a jam . The little things done in simple fun and the big things done for love . The snickerers were really too serious-minded . They suspected everybodyand helped no one ; they were afraid of one another and had almostno fun at all . P189Frankie , offstage among other bit players , heard the voice of the evening'sstar and caught glimpses of that noble brow whenever the door opened and shut : Record Head Bednar lowering the mike to question a cap the color of any district-station corridor above a shirt broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Record Head longed to know . " Took a cab home was all , " Frankie heard Blood-Spots explain . " That 's no crime . Did you pay the driver ? " " I could n't . " " Why not ? " " He was n't in the cab . " " That 's the chances you take . Next man . " The mike was moved before an old hallroom boy who stepped forward as proudly as a newly appointed ward committeeman at a politician'sbanquet , quavering importantly . " Now I realize the true wort ' of friendship  --  if a man has friends that 's all he needs . " " You were n't looking for friends with a nine-inch file in a dentist 's office . You were prospecting . " " I 'm a maintenance engineer at Thompson 's . " As if that explained the file . " You mean you have charge of the doughnuts ? " " I got a good record there . " " You got a good one here too . " The captain waved the charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funny fellow . " Back so soon , Julius ? " " Back ? I ai n't even been gone . " " Silly Willie here hustles schoolboys out of their lunch money with phony dice , " Record Head explained and returned his attention to Julius . " What were you carrying a pistol for ? " " For pertection . " " Protection from who ? Those seventh-graders ? " " I brought it back from the service . " " How long were you in ? " " Thirty-eight days . " " How many times were you wounded ? " Julius permitted himself a derisive little one-sided smile , faintly contemptuousof all non-combatants , and let the listeners wait .   " Okay , " Record Head forgave him impulsively , " we 'll lock up the officer who pinched you . Okay ? " " Okay . " " Then we 'll give you back the gun and an extra box of shells if you promise not to sue the city . Promise ? " " Suits me fine . " It suited Julius fine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the green steel door inched up a few feet and Frankie stood with a backstage view of the rows where , here and there among the listeners , a police badge glistened and all faces were dark and featureless . While upon the stage all faces were lined up under a glare that brought out every wrinkle , pimple and scar . A girl in plaid slacks was being urged forward by a police matron . Castingher eyes downward , the black arrows of the girl 's lashes became dipped in two great tears . " Save it for the jury , Betty Lou , " the captain counseled her and turned to the listeners . " This is the slickest little knockout broad in seventeen states . How come you always pick on married men , Betty Lou ? " Betty Lou lifted the long damp lashes : the eyes held a wry and mockinglight . " They 're the ones who do n't sign complaints , " she explained softly . And gave the audience a hard profile . So the men came on again : the ragged , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nameless , useless supermen from nowhere . " For climbin ' a telephone pole at tree A.M. wit ' a peanuts machine on my back . " " For makin ' anon'mous phone calls to call my wife dirty names . " " Twice as big a crowd as here ' n a woman picked on me . " " Went upstairs with a girl ' n came down with a cop . " A shock-haired razorback with a bright Bull Durham string hanging over his shirt pocket 's edge : " Just throwed a rock at a wall ' n it happened to go through a window instead . So I followed through . But I did n't have no intent of stealing . " " You never have . But you 're in and out like a fiddler 's elbow all the Fame . What was the stretch in the Brushy Mountain pen for ? " " I got the wrong number was all . " " I think you did . The wrong house number . " " That 's right . The people were home . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you 're drinking light ? " " Mind my own business . "   " You have n't got any business . For a quarter you 'd steal the straw out of your mother 's kennel . " The razorback tossed his tawny shock and his face in that light looked tawny too . " What I 'd do for a quarter you 'd do for a dime . " And held the captain 's gaze to prove it . Record Head 's heart felt suddenly as if it were beating without love for any man at all . The finger of accusation leveled at him so steadily by a shock-haired boy revived in him the dream in which he was the pursued . " How 'd you like it in the pen ? " he asked in old routine . " I did n't . " " Why not ? Would n't the warden give you his job ? " That was always the answer to that one . They always stepped into it the same way . Yet the light titter of lip laughter that followed , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fill the emptiness down the dry well of the captain'sheart . He listened to the next youth , an epileptic in a dark green wool sweater and a stocking cap , without really hearing the boy 's words at all . " Just havin ' fun with a little girl  --  I was in Dixon but my old man got me out , I was gettin ' worse . When I fool around a little I get better . " " Well , " the captain thought absently , " we all feel better if we fool around a little "  --  and caught himself up sharply . " I need a rest is all , " he decided , and forgave himself uneasily . As he could not forgive one of those up there under the lights . " A friend of mine went to sleep and I took his money before somebody else did . " " For unbecoming words to a lady , I think it 's called . " Tor tryin ' to talk a friend out of trouble  --  he was settin ' in a patrol wagon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so they put me in with him . " " Went down to the West Side to round up bums for a labor gang ' n got picked up for one myself . " " Picked up at an unreasonable hour . " Of late all hours to the captain seemed unreasonable . " I know you , " he thought cunningly of all outlaws . " I know you . I know you all . " Till the next line 's shadows came on , and the outlaws followed their shadows . Followed their shadows into the glare ; and left the glare once more to shadows . It made the captain want to shield his own eyes ; for a moment he looked ready to cup his head in his hands . " The old boy is drivin ' him-P192self as hard as he 's drivin ' the bums , " Frankie thought with a certain malice . Then the glare hit his own eyes . A glare that made any man look like a plastic job with a prefabricatedexpression grafted on , according to some criminologist 's graph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captain 's charge sheet had him accused : here was a pickpocket 's deadpan mask and here a shoplifter 's measured manner . Here the brutal lines of the paid-in-full premeditatedmurderer and there the coneroo 's cynical leer . Yet the man behind the murderer 's mask was under the lights for stealing a bushel of mustard greens and the coneroo 's leer had been picked up for oversleeping in a Halsted Street hallway . " Why you living on Skid Row ? " " ' Cause I 'm on the skids . That 's plain enough . " And the black and bitter orange of the brownskin buck 's sweater standing out so strongly and strangely against the fluffy white and pale blue of the aging white beside him . The listeners watched the captain survey the next man , up and down , head to toe and back again , to ask at last : " Where 's your shoes , boy ? " " Left ' ern in the tavern . " " Had n't there been a fight in there ? " " Lord , there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know the place . " " Sure . I hang in there . " " Where ? On a hook ? " " No . By the bar . I preach salvation there . " " Where were you ordained ? " " I just have a local preacher 's license . " " How do you get one of those ? " " You have to see the pastor and the deacon . " " How about the precinct captain ? " " He 's in jail . " " I think that 's where you get most of your philosophy yourself . " " That 's where I took up the ministry all right . " " Ca n't you preach salvation with your shoes on ? Is that some Hindu cult out there says you have to take off your shoes ? " " No , sir . I was collectin ' . " " But could n't you collect with your shoes on ? " The captain sounded determined . " It was my shoes I was trying to collect . "  |p193The  captain leaned forward , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already fearing the reply : " Just tell me one thing  --  who had your shoes ? " " Why , the precinct captain , of course . That 's what I been tryin ' to tell you . " The captain shook his head with the melancholy manner of any man who knows he ca n't win and motioned wearily for the mike to be moved on . " Next man , what for ? " " For standin ' by watchin ' . " " Watchin ' what ? " " The officers linin ' up the boys on Thirty-first Street . " Bednar took a moment to raise himself slowly onto his toes to make certain that this one was wearing sandals or any sort of footwear at all . " I do n't want to go through that again , " he cautioned himself aloud . " They lined you up too ? " " One of the officers called me boy ' and I told him I was a man so I had to come along . " " The milk 's still wet behind your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll be Joliet-bound before they 're dry ' n they 'll make a man of you there . Next . " " " I 'm accused of rape . " How old was that child ? " " Thirty-seven . She volunteered her services . " " She volunteer her ring and watch too ? " " Yes , sir . " " What a man . Were n't you the one who was in here last August for assaulting your baby ? " " That 's some misidentity . All that happened was I dropped the lid when the Mrs. slugged me with the fuel-oil can . " " What about that gun charge in 1944 ? Was that some misidentity ' ? " " I was a janitor then ' n had to protect myself from tenants . " " Making you a janitor is like putting an automobile thief in charge ofIt parking lot . You 're the biggest misidentity ever walked in shoekdther . " The captain 's eyes went down the line . The masks were managing to change , slowly and ever so slyly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some plastic zoo : animals stuffed for some State Street Toylandthe week before Christmas . Here was the toothless tiger and hereP194the timid lion , here the bull that loved flowers and there some lovelorn moose . The toothless tiger stood in a faded yellow hat from some long-faded summer , his stripes blurred by the city jungle 's dust and sprayed blood dried on the hat 's stiff brim : but still trying to look like a tiger . It always seemed some long-faded summer for those who lived in that feral glare under one hard straw kelly or another ; or any old hat at all . " My buddy hit me wit ' a Coca-Cola bottle , " the toothless tiger explained , " so I bust his plate-glass window . " " You 're mixed up with so many busted windows you ought to join the fire department . Ever do time ? " " Just a week once , for robbery . " " Only a week ? " Frankie had to crane his head to get a glimpse of this one . For every time the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rememberall the things these fools said to tell Molly-O some day . " It was just a small robbery . " The captain 's eyes besought the darkened rows for help but the rows only looked back at him bleakly . Till the next odd fish stood forth . " Officers do n't like my looks is all . I sell strictly American merchandise and do n't have no complaints . " " If they do n't complain it 's because they 're ashamed to admit buying the stuff . You sneak up and offer them phony jewelry as if it were hot stuff , " the captain accused him . " It ai n't phony , it 's American-made , " the coneroo begged off . " Well , " the captain pondered , " you been acting funny since 1919 and most of the cops who used to arrest you are dead . How 'd you beat that federal rap ? You must have had a good lawyer . " " No lawyer at all . " " Who prepared the writ ? " " Another con . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nerve tugged suddenly at the captain 's left wrist as if someone unseen were trying to cuff it to the mike . " You another one of them window smashers ? " he asked the boy in the black-and-white lumberjack . " No , sir . I 'm a seaman . " " Then how 'd the window get broken ? " " Knocked my old man through it . " " You 're a seaman all right . On the Humboldt Park lagoon . " P195The Humboldt Park salt snickered . " Very funny , " he observed . " Captain , you 're killing me . " The flat-nosed , square-faced , tousled blond with the dark lines under the eyes was next . With his left sleeve slit to the shoulder . As if his life , like his knife , had been turned upon himself at last . " Francis Majcinek , Division Arms Hotel , " and added indulgently : " That 's on Division . " " Thank you . I always thought it was on Eighth and Wabash  --  where 's the punk ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Talk into the mike , not at me . And get off that back rail . What were you up to with the shopping bag at Nieboldt 's , Dealer ? " " Went to buy an eye-ron . " " With a shopping bag ? " " Had to stop by the butcher 's on the first floor . " " You should of stayed on the first floor . Those were n't lamb chops fell out of the bag . " Frankie grinned . He could still see those damned irons bouncing . " Get that grin off your puss  --  what else did you boost over the holi-days ? " Frankie managed a look of blandest innocence . " You got me wrong , Captain . I was lookin ' around for the cashier --  " " When the bag broke , " the captain finished for him . And eyed him rrroodingly . " I like liars , " he decided at last , " but you suit me too well . What did you need six irons for ? I do n't suppose you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that , Captain , " Frankie assured Bednar earnestly , I needed one for the wife ' n the others were for when that one wore out . They make things so cheap these days . " " I do n't know who you think you 're kidding or whether you 're trying to be funny , " Bednar told him , studying him to find out what was really the matter . There was something wrong all right , the dealer really was n't trying to be funny at all ; his face had somehow altered in the past month . At the moment it looked both pious and weak . " Come down off that cross ' n give me a straight story , " the captain pleaded  --  and as he asked it he got it  --  in one moment he knew beyond any doubt at all . " How long you been on the stuff , Frankie ? " Frankie heard the small , reluctant note of surprised sympathy under Record Head 's voice .   " Not too long , " he acknowledged easily , coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note . " I 've kicked it . " " Where you 're going you 'll have to kick it . You think you can straighten up out there ? " " I 'm straight now . " " And you wo n't go right back on it when you make the street again ? " " I 've learned my lesson , Captain . " " I hope to God you have . " The captain took off his glasses and covered his eyes , to rest them from the light a moment . When he replaced them he studied Frankie 's charge sheet a long minute , while Frankie shifted restlessly in the glare and wished they 'd move the damned mike away from his chin . When he heard the captain 's voice again he turned his head attentively toward the shadow out of which the voice came at him . " Here 's a man with thirty-six months service and the Purple Heart , " he heard Bednar telling the listeners , " he was a fast hustler with a deck when he went in the service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Kippel 's torpedoes now , Frankie ? " " All I do is deal , Captain . " " How long you been out of the army ? " " Over a year . " " And Louie Fomorowski been dead how long ? " " I did n't even know the fellow was sick , Captain . " " Then you did know the man ? " " Heard of him . " " Seen him on your bedpost lately ? " " I sleep pretty sound . " " You do n't look it . Frankie , you do n't look like you slept in a month . " And never took his eyes off Frankie all the while the mike was being moved . While Frankie looked straight ahead . " Not a nerve in his body , " the wondering listeners heard the captain murmur at last . In the brief interval between the departure of one line and the arrival of the next the captain leaned forward on his elbows and spread his fingers gently across his temples ; the light kept hurting his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to face one more man manacled by steel or circumstance until his own heart should stop hurting . Yet they come on and come on , and where they come from no captainknows and where they go no captain goes : mush workers and lushP197workers , catamites and sodomites , bucket workers and bail jumpers , till tappers and assistant pickpockets , square johns and copper johns ; Ministers and ballroom boys , ancient pious perverts and old blown parolees , rapoes and record-men ; the damned and the undaunted , the jaunty and condemned . Heartbroken bummies and the bitter rebels : afternoon prowlers and midnight creepers . Peeping Toms and firebox pullers . The old cold-deckers and the young torpedoes coming on faster than the law can pick them up . The unlucky brothers with the hustlers ' hearts . " It says here you were annoying a ten-year-old girl . " " I beg your pardon . " " Beg my pardon for what ? " " It was a ten-year-old boy . " The captain crossed himself . " I beg your pardon , " he apologized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vein . " The captain felt ready for almost anything tonight , in the weariest sort of way . For knowing the answers to every alibi and having a tailor-made quip ready for every answer only seemed to make him wearier than ever of late . " Snatched a purse where Sinatra was singing . " " Do you swoon too ? " The captain was weary tonight all right . Worst of all were the witnesses who snickered after every questioning . If only , just once , one of them would laugh out from the heart . And felt the finger of guilt again tap his forehead and the need of confession touch his heart like touching a stranger 's heart . A voice like his own voice , confident and accusing : " That 's your man , Captain . That 's your man . " A voice like his own voice . Yet a heart like a hustler 's heart . " I 'm affiliated with two bolts of poster paper , " the odd fish near the end of the line announced before he was asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the captain wanted to know . " Put a cigar in my pocket ' n set my coat on fire , " the next youth offered cheerfully . " Why did n't you pull the firebox ? " " What do you think I 'm here for ? " " I picked up a drunk , " a South State Street strongarmer explained . " I 'll say you did . By the pockets . " " I got a perforated eardrum , " the next pointed out as though that condition justified all felonies under ten thousand dollars .   " You must have got it crawling in ' n out of transoms , " the captain diagnosed him , " you can still hear a squad car coming , ca n't you ? " " If I could I would n't be here . " " How long were you in Leavenworth ? " " Five years eight months twenny-eight days . " " How many minutes ? " " Next time I 'll take a watch . " " Next time you wo n't need one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his mind jumped to a conviction as automatic as it was without basis in the charge sheet : the dealer had had the punk with him . Out of the file he kept in his head Bednar slipped a certain arrest slip . Then slipped it back feeling pleased with Mr. Schnackenberg 's bill that made two felonies , of the same nature , add up to recidivism . The punk must have had a quicker eye for that ace in the draperies . " Not off one conviction I ai n't no habitual , " the ex-con on the platformanswered the captain 's accusation at last . " You 'll have your day in court , " the captain assured him . " Tell the court that Belgian .22 was to pick your teeth with . Maybe they 'll believe you . I do n't . " The man with the Southern Comfort accent and the true assassin 's mug complained sullenly , " I ai n't been in trouble in eleven years . They made a believer of me on Governor 's Island . When I got out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a transparent one so the officers can see what 's in it . " The captain had an answer for everything tonight . He had n't been listening to their lies for twenty-odd years for nothing . " I cook on the Santa Fe . " " Glad to know it . After this I 'll ride the Southern Pacific . " He dismissed the cook for some gaunt wreck in a smudged clerical collar . " Are you a preacher ? " The captain sounded puzzled . " I 've been defrocked . " " You still preach pretty good when it comes to cashing phony checks . What were you defrocked for ? " " Because I believe we are all members of one another . " That one stopped the captain cold . He studied the wreck as if suddenlyso uncertain of himself that he was afraid to ask him what he had meant by that . " I do n't get it , " he acknowledged at last , and passed on , with greater confidence , to a little heroin-head batting his eyes and coughing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @   " I ai n't used the stuff for fourteen years , " he lied right into the mike the moment it was moved to his lips . " Then how come you were shooting that girl in the arm when the cops come in ? You were putting her on it too , you Fagin . " " How could I ? She been on it longer than I have . " " Tell that to a mule and he 'll kick your head off . The girl is nineteen and you 're forty-four and on top of that you had her so drunk she did n't even know her own name . " " Well , she acts older . ' N I ai n't forty-four . I 'm thirty-nine ' n that chick is twenty if she 's a month . " The heroin head smiled virtuously at having established his innocenceso irreproachably . As the final line shuffled off the listeners rose in the rows as though to wish all such irreproachable innocents long life and good health on the way . Under the dimming lights the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkness . But the listeners straightened their trousers and smoothed their dresses down and one by one , by twos and threes , by smiling threes and laughing fours , all left through a well-lighted door onto a clean well-lighted street . With nothing , it seemed , to fear in the world at all . Only the captain , trapped between the hunters and the hunted , looked mournfully through that green steel door as though yearning to follow Isis innocents there . To follow each man to a cell all his own , there to confess the thousand sins he had committed in his heart . For he seemed to see them still , each with the left hand manacled and the right thrown protectively across the eyes . As his own left hand , in dreams , seemed cuffed , of late , to smooth cold steel . As he had one morning wakened to find his own right hand flung across his eyes . " I 'll get dark shades for the bedroom , " Record I lead decided restlessly , " the light is wakin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priest to wash clean the guilt of the captain 's darkeningspirit nor any judge to hear his accusing heart . The court forbade him entrance to that narrow green steel door . Justice had been done ; his case was closed . He could not even tell the names of those who 'd taken the rap for him . To leave him , of all men most alone , of all men most guilty of all the . lusts he had ever condemned in others . P200What was it that the defrocked priest had said ? " We are all members of one another . " What had the holy-sounding fraud meant by that ? Why had several snickered then and not one had laughed out from the heart ? Bednar had n't understood then and could not let himself understand now . It had been too long since he himself had laughed from the heart . Yet the words had left him with a secret and wishful envy of every man with a sentence hanging over his head like the very promise of salvation . Leaving him with no recourse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece of spoiled meat in the throat , and turn out the chargesheetlamp . " Come down off that cross yourself , " he counseled himself sternly , like warning another . But the captain could n't come down . The captain was impaled . P200In the real dark night of the soul it is alwaysthree o'clock in the morning , day after day . Frankie lived by day beside the ceaseless , dumping shuffle of the threeleggedelephant which was the laundry 's sheet-rolling machine . When he piled onto his narrow pad in the long dim-lit dorm at night and turned his face to the whitewashed wall , the three-legged elephant of the mangle roller followed , galumphing , through dreams wherein he dealt Record Head Bednar hand after hand while Louie Fomorowski watched from behind the captain 's chair . Night after night . When the lights were down all voices were subdued . Down the long and low-roofed hall the good boys slept : the laundry and the bakery workers , the printshop typesetters and the boys who sat in classroomsand accepted their sentences with the dry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones who had convinced the chaplain that they were really going straight this time . Frankie too had convinced the chaplain . It had been harder to convince a certain ex-army major . " That vein been injured , " he 'd told Frankie in the infirmary on Frankie 's very first morning . " How long you been punchin ' holes in it ? " " I been on the sleeve since I got out of the army , Doc , " Frankie told hint. " flow big a habit you got , son ? " " Not too big . I go for a quarter grain a day . " " Big enough . But I 've seen them come in here hooked worse than that ' n still kick it . In here you got to kick it . When you get sick I 'll taper you off and if you behave yourself you 'll be out for Thanksgiving , al1 have it kicked for keeps . Still , there 's boys in here who 'll tell youP204they can get you anything from heroin to gage for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price . But if you get out of line any time you 're in here  --  remember that you 're on the books as a user . I 'll get you shipped to Lexington ' n that wo n't be for a week end the way it used to be . That 'll be six months added . I tell you now for your own good and I wo n't tell you again . " Frankie gave him the grin . " I 'll tough it out , Doc . " After that Frankie slipped into a life like the life of the barracks he had known for three years . Orders were given matter-of-factly without threats ; and were obeyed complacently . Most of the men kept themselves as clean as if preparing for retreat each evening and most , out of sheer boredom , attended services in the pink-and-white chapel on Sunday morning . And each good soldier counted his two days off a month , for good behavior , like money in the bank and well earned . All but Applejack Katz , with a long-term lease on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daily risked his good-conduct time for the sake of a certain jar fermenting under the ventilator . He 'd bought cider from one of the kitchen workers and , at every meal where boiled potatoes were served , stole the skins and made Frankie steal them too . He added the potato skins to the cider after lights out anas only waiting for a chance to snatch a few white-bread crusts . " W en we get them crusts it 'll only take a week after that , " he promised Frankie . He leaned across the cot to add a low warning word : " I seen you come out of the infirmary your first morning , Dealer . My advice to you is look out for the major . He 's a psycho . What he 'll do to you is to get you so square you 'll never have another day 's pleasure in your life . " Katz glanced about the dormitory with a look so swift and furtive Frankie was reminded , with a troubling pang , of Sparrow Saltskin . " Listen . They sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forty-five then ' n if I 'd worked two full weeks in my life I do n't remember where . If anyone had told me , eight years ago , I 'd go to work for eight hours a day six days a week and stick at it over two years I would of give him hundred to one against it . ' N I would of lost . ' Cause that 's just how square I got . " For two years I was off the booze , off the women , off the horses , off the dice . I even got engaged to get married in a church . All I done that whole time was run a freight elevator up ' n down , up ' n down . It scares me when I think of it now : I come near losin ' everything . " P205Applejack lay back in the very real relief of one snatched from the eternal fires , at the last possible moment , straight up into Salvation Everlasting . He gave a low laugh , mocking and wise . " Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psycho . He done me so much good that other time , ' they try to tell me , he almost cured my new-rosis . ' Sure the fool almost cured my new-rosis . ' If I went back he might cure it altogether  --  and what would I have left ? All the good times I ever had in my life was what my little old new-rosis made me have . Them whole two years on the square I did n't have one good time . I like my little old new-rosis . It 's all I got ' n I 'm holdin ' onto it hard . My advice to you is hold onto yours : lay off them psychos . Look out for the major . When guys like you ' n me get square we 're dead . " Katz had a record that read like a Southern Pacific Railroad schedule . He 'd made every stop between Jeff City and Fort Worth and had fashioned applejack out of white-bread crusts and potato skins in every one . Of his fifty-odd years fifteen had been spent between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sometimes it had been hard to make and had turned out badly , in other places it had been easy and had turned out fine : his life was the definitive work on the science of making applejack under the eyes of prison guards . He remembered certain jugs as if remembering certain people : the El Paso County Jug , recalled with joy and a certain tenderness , that he had kept filled , through a kitchen connection , night and day for six blissful months . The Grant 's Pass Jug , recalled with bitterness and doubt , that had been spirited out of his cell in the night and never seen again . But applejack was n't Katz 's only interest . He had half a dozen minor projects going , involving the bartering of nutmeg for Bull Durham , of Bull Durham for nutmeg and of emory for the manufacture of something he called a " glin wheel , " a sort of homemade cigarette Iighter . It was also his daily concern , while working beside Frankie on the mangle roller , to steal the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which he sold clandestinely to the harder cons upstairs . The cons up there were either in bug cells or deadlock . They were the privates who went for stronger brew than applejack . These no longer cared : these were the truly unsaved . Over the hump for redemption and the hour for turning back lost forever : too late , forever too late . So they hurried forward all the faster into the darkness . They talked in terms of police administrations and remembered inP206terms of police cars . " That was the year the aces had black Cadillacs with a bell on the side  --  or was that the year they had them speedy orange Fords ? " One night some pale castoff , a twenty-year-old so far gone in narcoticism that nothing but the one big bitter fix of death could cure him , was placed among the good soldiers either by error or just to see how long he could stand it there . It did n't take long for the panic to start . One look at the stolid faces about him , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook him like an icy wind . " Bond me out ! Do n't touch meI " The junkie wants a bondsman though he does n't own a dime . His life is down to a tight pin point and the pupils of his eyes drawn evil tighter : nothing is reflected in them except a capsule of light the size of a single quarter grain of morphine . He has mounted the walls of all his troubles with no other help than that offered by the snow-white caps in the brown drugstore bottle . A self-made man . But all the drugstores are closed tonight . " Bond me out ! Bond me out ! " And the flood of shameless tears . By the time the major shuffled in , yawning , with the hypo , the junkie was throwing a regular circus for the boys , tossing himself about on the floor . It took four men to hold him down to give him his charge at last . " I think he ate somethin ' did n't agree with him , " Applejack observed after the youth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cold sort of mirth . The only laughter that broke the monotony here was that same hard-bitten glee : " The service is gettin ' pretty bad when a man has to knock his skull on the floor to get a charge of M. I remember a time when all you had to do was hold your breath for half an hour . " Yet such pale youths felt as devout about their addiction as others might of some crotchety religious conviction or other . " I 'm just the type got to have it , that 's all . It 's how I 'm built . Do n't ask me why  --  how do I know ? It 's just something , cousin . It 's there . " Frankie Machine understood too well . Standing at the sheet roller on his eleventh morning , it hit him so hard and so fast he went down beside the machine while the sheets , unguided , twisted and tore themselves to shreds at the very moment that his own entrails were tearing at his throat and his very bones were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wounded tomcat 's down the icy corridors of his anguish . He lay eight hours in a 104 fever before the major pulled him out of it with dolaphine . " If you get sick on me like that again you wo n't even get paregoric off me , " were the first words he could distinguish , and blinked the sweat out of his eyes to see the major studying him . " Next time I 'm lettin ' you sweat it out , soldier . " Back at the sheet roller two mornings later , Frankie felt he 'd already sweated it out . All that remained of his sickness was a couple days of the chuck horrors , of which Nifty Louie once had told . " It feels like I got a tape snake or somethin ' , " he complained to Applejack Katz , " every two hours the bottom falls out of my gut ' n I feel like I could eat myself through a cow on the hoof . " Katz traded off his " glin wheel " to a kitchen connection for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Frankie consumed it in a single day . " Wait till the applejack is ready , " Applejack immediately promised him , " that 'll kill the chucks every time . " " Ai n't it ready yet ? " Frankie pleaded a little , he still felt so weak . " Give it just one more day , " Applejack promised . Katz could give anything he owned to anyone but the warden . Except that applejack . He was no more able to give that away than to give away his blood . When the horrors had passed at last Frankie felt himself beginning to want Molly-O again . He had n't had one visitor , not so much as a letter or a card , in all those hard first two weeks . But he 'd gotten to know some of the boys who were neither trying to be good soldiers , like himself , nor bad ones like those upstairs . These were the ones who just would n't work . Yardbirds who could n't quite be trusted in a bakery or a laundry . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . But time off for good conduct means little to men with no place to go and nothing in particular to do when they get there . They were men and youths who had never picked up any sort of craft  --  though most of them could learn anything requiring a mechanical turn with ease . It was n't so much lack of aptitude as it was simply the feeling that no work had any point to it . They lived in prison much as they had lived out of it , vaguely contented most of the time , neither hoping nor despairing , wanting nothing but a place to sleep and a tin pie plate with some sortP208of slop or other on it a couple times a day . They neither worried about the future , regretted the past nor felt concern for the present . They were the ones who had never learned to want . For they were secretly afraid of being alive and the less they desired the closer they came to death . They had never been given one good reason for applyingtheir strength . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-deceptions . They gave nothing because nothing had been given them . If they lost their privileges they shrugged it off , they had lost certain privileges before ; one way or another they had had always to forfeit any small advantage gained by luck , chance or stealth . Some slept at the race-track barns all summer and crashed County in the winter , year after year . Getting back to the barns a week sooner or later did n't mean much , it would probably be raining that week anyhow . So why get all steamed up in a laundry all winter for nothing ? Where was the payoff ? They did n't even read comic books . They had been bored to death by all that the day before they were born . The whole business between birth and death was a sort of inverted comic strip , too dull to read even if set right . So what was the difference whether a man slept on wood or hay ? " Rubber heels ' n fisheyes again " was the word on the meatloaf and tapioca , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  warless soldiers as indifferent to Sunday mutton as the walls were indifferent to themselves ; yet feigning to look forward to a Sunday dinner as tasteless in the mouth as life was in their hearts . Sometimes something wakened and flared feebly in one of these : he talked back and got to think it over in deadlock . Deadlock was any cell with a red metal tag locked onto the bars to indicate the man was either a junkie or just out of line . As long as the tag stayed there it meant no yard privileges , no cigarettes , no newspapersand no mail ; no candy , no card playing and the next time maybe you 'll keep that big trap buttoned . Deadlock meant a monotony more deadly even than the regular abnormal monotony of jailhouse days and nights . For no one can sleep all the time and deadlock brought hours when memory caught up with a man at last . Hours in which to sit and remember that willing long-ago lovely who 'd married some square after all ; or a family thatp209cared less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one blue-andgoldEaster Sunday a dozen blue-gold Easters ago . Thinking of release only slowed the hours down to the deadliest crawl of all  --  yet of what else was there to think ? And what could freedom mean except a chance to get out of the state with one clean shirt on your back and jump back on the con the day it got dirty ? You had to get across the state line to promote some decent clothes and enough change in the poke to take a woman to a movie or a bar . So the deadlockers walked up and down till they grew weak at the knees , slept and rose to walk again till night and day and the weariness in the knees and the weariness of the mind all rolled together into one big cell-sized , life-sized weariness . " The day after I come out of deadlock the first time , " Applejack Katz told Frankie , " I seen how they got all the clocks stopped at twelve o'clock ' n I realized I was in deadlock whether I was in a cell with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night and day were one and the heart itself felt like a clock stopped cold on a dead-cold hour . The very hour that life was to begin ; and would not tick again . Yet even a stopped clock can be right for a while . If time moves slowly enough . And Frankie lived in a deadlock only somewhat darker and narrower than that deadlock in which all his days had been spent . Just one bit lighter than the deadlock of the cells with the red metal tag . To the tune of some old frayed song , offered over and over again by Applejack Katz in his horrible fifty-four-year-old squawk . " I 'm a ding-dong daddy from Duma ' N you ought a see me do my stuff . " Till all the other cots would howl him down . " That stuff ought to be about ready , " Frankie hinted . Applejack felt it was n't yet sufficiently fermented . Though Frankie would hear him rise in the night , fumble about under the ventilator , hear the secret gulping in the dark and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once , long after lights out , that querulous , quavering squawk . " I 'd feel bad if you 'd kissed too manyBut I 'd feel worse if you had n't kissed any . " P210All the next day , working beside Frankie at the mangle roller , Katz murmured songs as frayed as his voice . There was a certain sly merrimentabout old Applejack . One felt that , secretly , he was convinced he 'd already beaten the state on so many charges that there was no chance at all of the state getting it back in terms of timeserving . He could be in the rest of his life , he knew , and still end up far ahead of the game . Down in the G-H blocks the punks from eighteen to twenty lived in shifts more sullen than that which Frankie shared with Katz . G was for the black punks and H for the whites . The whites went to school in the mornings and blacks in the afternoons . The sign in the mess-hall library said : THINKRead a good bookWhich did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading a good book at the same time as a white punk ; and did n't say just what book . Each went to think separately , for the thinking of separate thoughts . For the black con 's brain , it appeared , was darker than the white con 's and therefore required the afternoon sunlight to assist the thinking of certain scheduled thoughts . Yet , strangely enough , the chair in the basement accepted any color at all . Indeed , it was painted black just to show how little race feeling there was down there in the basement where the afternoon sunlight did n't shine at all . Nor did the big black sheriff 's wagon that pulled up for the haul to Stateville , St. Charles , Dixon and Menard draw any particular color line . The punks piled in it , leaping over each other as if going on a picnic , filled with a sudden brainless , coltish joy to be out of the cells and riding in the open air for the hour that took them down Route 66 . One hour . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the immediate sun . Screwy punks and tough punks , wise punks and dumb punks , dirty punks and clean punks , little punks and big punks , skinny punks and fat punks : here comes the wagon and we 'll all take a ride . Here comes the sheriff 's wagon , punks , and you 'll be a long time gone . While all clocks will remain forever , however long you serve , precisely at twelve o'clock .   " A.M. or P.M. ? " Frankie Machine wondered idly , as if it really madesome difference . If you wanted to know the time you asked the screw and were told , inevitably : " Forget it . You ai n't goin ' nowheres . " The time the clockmakers had locked into the stopped clocks of these corridors was a different kind of time , Frankie felt , than that they had put into the clocks outside . Just as there was a different sort of time for cripples than for junkies , and a different kind of time than either for dealers , there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he went to Mass , in the pink-and-white chapel lined with portrayals of the Stations of the Cross , fashioned by some forgottenfelon . He always knelt beneath one labeled Jesus Falls the First Time , he did n't know why . Yet that one touched him most . He would cross himself , genuflect and assure himself mystically , " Zosh 'll be so much better when I get out I 'll be able to tell her about me ' n Molly-O myself , I wo n't have to let Vi do the dirty job for me . " On some Sunday morning dream train with the incense in his nose . When his next ten days had passed without any recurrence of the sickness he began drawing fresh courage with the passing of each new clay . " The hell with Nifty Louie ' n Private McGantic , too , " he told himself one night , refusing either to see Louie " on his bedpost " as 1lednar had put it or to worry about McGantic 's terrible monkey . " Louie was a long time livin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's more people better off for his bein ' out of the way than not . " And the memory of that hallway blow returned to him like the memory of a blow by which he had freed himself from McGantic 's monkey . He felt not the faintest flutter of remorse for his part in the passing of Louie F. Remorse touched his memory of the fixer only when he recalled that , by losing his head , he had lost the fixer 's big fat roll . From the passage of the nights now he gained more strength than he had ever gained from a hypo . He felt himself getting over the roughestpoint of the hump without so much as a quarter grain to help him over . And knowing how proud Molly-O was going to be for him , felt proud of himself . The pride he 'd abandoned in the ward tent on the narrow Meuse . Through the open laundry window the first cold hint of spring touched him as had that other spring on that cold and alien river . " I got the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a man who 'd seen a festering wound in his flesh dry before his eyes and slowly start to heal . P212For now all things healed strangely well within him , as though by grace of his punishment . He was paying off for smashing up Sophie , the irons had only been God 's means to let him , a priest told him ; so that when he was released everything he 'd done would be paid for and he 'd be truly free at last . " I feel like , someday , I 'm gon na shine again , " he told old Applejack . And heard , through walls as high as tenement walls , a long , slow , dull whirr-whirr . As of a heavy sewing machine being pedaled by some lame and sweating con . Ten o'clock in the morning . Above the visitors ' cage burned one small dull red bulb and right below it , peering through the glass with the prison pallor on his face but the shadows gone from under his eyes , Frankie Machine waited for his first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was . Certainly the punk would n't have the nerve to come around after the way he 'd pulled out of the deal with the irons , ducking without a warning word so that Frankie might have gotten rid of that damned bag . Then spotted Molly Novotny far down the line , trying to see over the heads of the other visitors like a child trying to see the animals in the zoo over the heads of the adults and saw him at last . She took his breath away with her pertness : a neat dark suit and little silver-heeled slippers that tap-tapped right on up to him just as she 'd tapped into his arms on the first floor front . They had only fifteen minutes and he did n't know what to ask first . There was so much he had to know and she had so much to tell . " That poor old man of Vi 's is gone , " was the first thing she reported . " He leaned out the window too far . " " So long as he was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vi just forgot to lock the window . " And they passed over Poor Old Husband as indifferently as life itself had passed Poor Husband by . " How 's Zosh ? " he wanted to know . " Gettin ' fatter than ever , Frankie , " and heard the ancient malice in her voice . " How are things going at the Safari ? " As soon as he asked that he knew he should n't have . For she did n't lower her eyes , she simply curtained them from him and he 'd never seen her look so hard.  | " I ai n't there no more , Frankie , " she told him defensively . " I do n't live downstairs no more . " " Where you livin ' , Molly ? " A leaden fear had him . He had to ask her twice before she could hear through the glass . Or just did n't want to hear . " Just around , Frankie . I 'm just livin ' around . You know . " The red bulb winked , the whistle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his bones she would n't return on any Visitors ' Day to come . " Little Lester , " he called himself . " Little Lester the Money Waster and Woman Chaser " and he lived up there in the bug cells with all appeals but the last one gone . Down where Frankie lived below rumors came each night of Little Lester 's latest piece of arrogance in the very face of the big black chair . But Frankie never got to lay eye on the fellow till , on the Saturday afternoon of Frankie 's sixth week , he caught a detail with Katz . " You two get the Susie-Q wagon ' n get up there to the fourth floor , " Screw told them , " there 's a ticket on both of you for talkin ' in line . " There was n't much to the detail . The Susie-Q wagon was the little white cart on which mops and buckets were borne . The fourth-floor boys themselves could n't be trusted with buckets and mops . Half of them were in deadlock and those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following . They were the sullen jug-heavies and the loudmouthed torpedoes , the gaunt jungle buzzards and the true assassins . " Me ' n you ' r just punks up against some of these birds , " Applejack reminded Frankie in secret admiration of all assassins and Frankie was glad , in that moment , to be on the books as only one more jerk who 'd tried to cop a piece of tin out of a West Side department store . He felt a clandestine thrill at recalling the thinness of the hair which had kept him out of the bug cells . " I almost made it up here myself , " he boasted to Applejack , " when I was on the junk I pulled lots of jobs . " And hastened to add , " I got it kicked for keeps now . " " It 's what they all say , " Applejack answered skeptically , and Frankie was too superstitious to boast further . " The smarter a guy is the harder he gets hooked , " Katz observed , " I 've seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ em hittin ' M , I 've seen ' em hittin ' the H ' n I 've seen ' em shootin ' speedballs  --  half a cap of C ' n half a cap of H together . C is the fastest , it 's whatP214they start on when they 're after a gentleman 's kick . M is slower ' n H is the slowest ' n cheapest of all , it 's what they wind up on when they 're just bummies tryin ' to knock theirselves out without no kick at all . But I 'll tell you one kick to lay off ' n that 's nembutal . If you miss the vein you get an abscess ' n the shade comes down . Lay off the nembie is my advice to you , Polak . " Just as if he had n't heard Frankie tell him he 'd kicked all that stuff . " Another thing works funny is gage , " Applejack resumed his report while dragging the little white wagon behind him . " One day you 'll pay two bucks for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Gim me twelve cents ' n a pack of butts for a stick , " n you pass him up . It do n't make sense to me neither the way they always say a guy gets high ' on it . My cell buddy at Grant 's Pass worked twenty years in mines around Scranton before he threw his shovel away ' n started eatin ' a little higher up on the hog . The gage never lifted him up , it sent him down . When it was hittin ' real good he 'd get to thinkin ' he was twelve miles underground . He never said he was coastin ' in . ' He always said , I think I 'm comin ' up . ' Say , if you get detailed down to the kitchen sneak me a fistful of nutmeg , I know a fool who 'll give a pack of butts for a sack of that stuff . I wonder what he does with it . " " Maybe he puts it in applejack , " Frankie hazarded a guess . " You guys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " but a guy got to do somethin ' to keep his mind occupied . Otherwise I 'd be thinkin ' how it used to be outside . " " When will you make the street again ? " Frankie asked him . " Never , soldier , " Katz told him without regret , almost with contentment . " When I finish here the feds pick me ' n I start a twenty-year rap  --  when I finish that one they can come ' n cremate me : I been caged up all my life , I do n't want even my bones to be cooped up in some hole in the ground , " he confided cheerfully to Frankie . " What can a guy like me do on the outside anyhow ? I 'm so used to holdin ' up my hand when I want another piece of bread ' n dumpin ' the silver in the wire basket on the way out from chow I would n't know how to do for myself on the outside no more . " A guard , eating off one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an empty cell with the door ajar , looked up at the pair as they passed and motioned them silently down the half-lit corridor toward the cell where Little Lester leered lewdly through the bars . All day Little Lester stood waiting for someone to pass whom heP215could bait for a moment . He liked to be looked upon pityingly in order that he might catch the pity coming at him on the fly and hurl it back between the eyes  --  to see pity replaced there first by shock , then by real hatred . Little Lester had long suspected that everyone in the world hated him , on sight and from the heart ; that all , without exception , had wished him to be dead since the morning he 'd been born . So it pleased him to prove to himself that he 'd been right in this suspicion all along , that everything the priests had told him since he 'd been so high had been wrong . Pity was the thing people used to conceal their hatred , Lester had decided , for the chaplain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lester had had trouble turning the chaplain against him but he had done it at last and now the chaplain hated him as cordially as did the screws , the warden , the sheriff , his attorney , his mother and sisters , his father and his old girl friend . " You guys want a pack of Bull Durham wit ' two papers for thirty-five cents ? " he began on them hurriedly , the moment he heard the cart roll up . Though he knew every con was forbidden to talk to him while he was in the cell . " You guys want to change jobs ? Look , you two firstfloormarks , all I do is play solitary ' n chew the fat with the screws all day . How 'd you like that awhile , marks ? " The marks did n't care to switch jobs at the moment , they had to keep the mops moving down the tier . " Hey ! " he called after them . " You the guys gon na split my pants ' n shave my little pointy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a rise out of us , " Katz cautioned Frankie , " he wants to see if he can get us in a little trouble , arguin ' with him about somethin ' . One of the screws asked his lawyer to make the guy lay off him , he kept askin ' things like is them fuses all screwed in good ' n tight , he do n't want no slip-ups ' cause he 's invited his folks as witnesses  --  it 's how he gets people 's nerves jumpin ' . If you ask me the guy is suck-silly . " " If you ask me it 's his nerves is jumpin ' the highest , " Frankie surmised . Applejack and Frankie stalled around at the far end of the block , for two soft-clothes men were coming up on either side of a little man with a bandaged eye and all three tagged by some joker in a spring topcoat , wearing the coat with the sleeves hanging emptily , like a woman 's cape . " That 's a newspaper joker , " Applejack assured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but only newspaper guys drape a coat on them like that . You know why ? " Frankie did n't have the faintest idea . " He ai n't got time to button it ' cause he got ta keep his hands free of his sleeves to take notes , in case somethin ' big happens real fast . If he takes time to get his hands out of his sleeves some other guy ' 11 beat him to the phone ' n get a scoop on him . I saw all about it in a movie at Jeff City . " Old Katz was proud of his knowledge . Frankie understood . " You 're right . I seen one come into the Victory on North Clark one night ' n set down with one bottle of beer ' n wrote in a little book-like , everythin ' that was goin ' on , what the people said . Then he picked up ' n did n't even touch his beer . He did n't touch his beer was how I knew there was somethin ' wrong with him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Applejack explained , " they all get together ' n write a book . " Though neither he nor Frankie could hear what either the bandage or the draped topcoat said to Little Lester , there was no difficulty at all in hearing the punk 's jeering reply . " Sure , ya stinkin ' squeala , I 'm the guy shot out ya eye . It was easy as eatin ' a ice-cream comb . So what ? Prove I 'm nuts I go to the buggy bin  --  they feed you there , do n't they ? ' N if I ai n't nuts I get the seat  --  so what ? Then I do n't have to bother with stinkin ' squealas no more . It do n't make me no difference . " Naw , I do n't feel nuttin ' good ' r bad . Good ' n bad is strictly for stinkin ' squealas . You know what ? I chew t'ree packs of gum a day but I do n't smoke . I do n't even eat much . I do n't even play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But what I really like is mechanics . I do n't like readin ' about crime stuff , they do n't put it down how it really is . What I really like is readin ' about takin ' t'ings apart ' n puttin " em togedder so they stay , like in airplanes . I used to go out to the airport just to watch , I seen them fancy squares all come down the gangplank like in them square movie pictures . " But what I really like is gym-a-nastics . That 's for me , it 's what I took up in the neighborhood . I crooked four days a week from school  --  you know what I was doin ' ? I was workin ' on the parallela bars . " Abruptly his mind returned to the point of the interview . " You know what made me sore ? " Nodding toward the bandaged eye . " It was n't when that pig of his scratched me , what really got me was when I shoot his dirty eye out ' n he says , Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comesP217on wit ' a pitch like that . " He imitated a high-pitched squeal : " ' Do n't shoot me , please do n't shoot me '  --  boy , I would of let the stinkin ' squeala have it for real then only the dirty gun jammed on me , I should of cleaned it wit ' somethin ' good first . " Naw , I never went for playin ' wit ' other kids , all they do is jump up ' n down . Girls ' r poison . Once though I had one of ' em I-got-to-get-intonight ' romantic deals , we went down to Hubbard Street ' n got a free blood test . She was on one side of the screen ' n I was on the other ' n we hollered over to each other . A real romantic deal . " My old man ? His one big trouble is he 's always a pallbearer ' n never a corpse . He 'd look better to me wit ' his dirty head off five inches beneat ' the shoulders . You know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on me for sellin ' the icebox while he was out stiffen ' some piece of trade ? I told him , Daddy darlin ' , you been workin ' for me for twennytwoyears . Now go out ' n get a job fer yourself . ' It 's what I told him , he 's a stinkin ' squeala too . " Applejack Katz looked at Frankie Machine and Frankie Machine looked at Applejack Katz . " Let 's get the detail done , " Applejack urged , " I got a deal on with a guy who got his hands on six bennies . " " What a loudmouth , " Frankie whispered of Little Lester . That was the name by which the screws knew Lester too . Yet , when on the last Saturday afternoon in April Frankie sat for an hour at the same dayroom table where Little Lester sat , the punk spoke softly all the while . This was an assigned group permitted to write letters or play cards under the eyes of two screws , between four and five o'clock . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care for cards you went all the same . Neither Frankie nor Lester wrote letters . They sat across from each other with a soiled deck between them while Frankie showed him some of the tricks which had once seemingly confoundedSparrow . " It took me ten years to learn this one , " Frankie explained , " pick a card . " " Show me one that do n't take so long , " Lester reminded him humbly . Once away from his cell bars , he abandoned his tough-guy act ; exactly as if he needed it only when locked behind steel for others to stare at and question. lie was only days from the chair if his last appeal were denied , yet slept and ate much as Frankie slept and ate . Therein lay a horror and a marvel for Frankie . Each saw the same gray corridors all night , eachp218night , with the same yellowish fog wadded about the night lights . Each wakened from dreams of lifelong deadlock to the same muffled sounds : down the tier the long day was beginning . Something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noticed how neatly combed and oiled Lester 's dark hair looked , and Lester caught Frankie 's glance . " I 'll have to wash the oil out the night before , " he explained earnestly , not even in the same voice he had used for the reporters at all . " Oil leaves a burn ' n they do n't like to leave a man burned even from sweat . " He spoke without any challenge to the world beyond the bars . " Here , " Frankie insisted , wanting to do something for Lester , " here 's one it only takes two weeks to learn . Pick a card . " But Little Lester had lost interest in cards and without a word picked up a book in which he sat immersed , not once raising his eyes till their hour was done . A book called How to Write Better Business Letters . Frankie did n't see Lester again for several weeks , though he once or twice saw the boy 's lawyer swinging down the corridor on that business of the last appeal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came out of the laundry with Applejack Katz to see two guards bringing Lester , uncufed , to some unknown destination . He turned cheerfully toward Frankie as he passed . " Hi , Dealer ! " he greeted Frankie . " Take a look at a man on his way to the chair ! " and sounded really deeply relieved . A face like any stranger 's face , slightly slant-eyed in the Slavic way . A face at once as old as the moons of Genghis Khan and as youthful as a child 's playground in May . He seemed smaller than Frankie had remembered him . It had seemed , in the weeks since , that he was a big man . Small but rugged and built all in one piece , with a heavy-legged stride , a little bowlegged as if he had learned to walk too early about the West Side 's broken walks . Frankie noticed that he was wearing bowling shoes with both laces neatly tied . " They ai n't takin ' him no place but the dentist 's chair , " Applejack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to recall with awe , months later , those neatly tied bowling-league shoes still faintly touched with chalk . " A guy got somethin ' like that on his mind ' n he jokes about goin ' toP219the chair ' n ties his laces like he had a big-league bowlin ' match comin ' up , " Frankie complained to Katz . " He has , " Applejack decided dryly , " he got to bowl over six thousand volts from a settin ' position . They 're puffin ' him down in the deadhouse Monday week . " Little Lester 's last appeal had been denied . When , two days later , Lester was taken into the prison yard for a workout Frankie and Applejack watched , from the ground-level laundry window . Lester and three others were being marched out there like stock . It was strange that the other three , though only small-time thieves , would draw a certain prestige about the prison for having been exercised beside the condemned youth . It was three o'clock of a May afternoon , the hour when school doors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand walks with books and crayons under their arms and their shoelaces tied into small , neat bows . A few more days till summer vacation and out in the prison yard a great crane , straining skyward to see the first sign of summer , caught only a glint of rusted iron sunlight instead . These were days of clouds swollen gray with promise of rain  --  only to burst emptily and reveal the deepest sort of blue drifting there all the time . Against the concrete wall Frankie saw a single con sitting on an upturned orange crate looking , under his winter pallor , like someone who 'd seen all there was to see of grief , in prison or out . That yard is laid out like somebody 's country garden ; there 's a duck pond and a chicken house and a pale blue birdhouse . Beyond the wall rises a two-story-high legend : BUDINTZ COALOne Price to AllWhile directly across the way from Budintz that company 's chief competitor offers its own appeal : RUSHMOORE COALFastest DeliveryCheapest in YearsAlong rows where , in summer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes of four guards . Behind them a machine gun 's ryes peered from the sentry 's tower . P220Without uniformity the cons touched their toes with their fingertips , bending awkwardly from the waist . Three of them had to stand spreadleggedto do so . Lester , Frankie saw with an odd pride , touched the toes without either bending the knees or spread-legging . Touched the tips of the shoes ' neat bows with the condemned tips of condemned wrists . A man no taller , not so old , neither uglier nor handsomer than himself . A man like any man , with a bit less luck than most . A punk like any punk . Clean-shaven , vain of his heavy head of hair . A youth much like any youth who has seen night games at Comiskey Park , shot six-nocountpool , applauded a strip tease on South State , played nickel-anddimepoker in the back of a neighborhood bar , crapped out on an eight-dollar pass or carried a girl 's photograph in his wallet one whole spring . Who perhaps had had a drink on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swimming trunks to the Oak Street Beach some summer afternoon when he 'd owned lake , water , sky , beach , sand , sun , the bright blue weather and every girl of all the girls that had passed so yearningly by . " He just does caliskonectics is all , " Applejack informed Frankie . " Do n't worry , they ai n't gon na let him climb the horizontal bars . He might get too good at it . " " If it was me I 'd tell ' em to let me skip the rope , " Frankie said , because he wanted to say something funny too . Only Applejack did n't see anything funny . " What good would that do ? " he demanded to know . " You 'd still have to beat the chair . Nobody gets the rope in Illinois any more . " Yet Frankie was n't quite as wrong as Applejack Katz thought . There was still one fugitive on Illinois 's books that would die by the rope when he was caught . Down in the sheriff 's basement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and roulette wheels that once had whirled for Guzik , Nitti and Three-Fingered White , stood the gallows that waited , year in and year out , for Terrible Tommy O'Connor 's return . Not many knew that still , behind the Board of Health Building , where once the County Jail had stood , the death house from which Terrible Tommy had escaped remained . Though the building about it had long been demolished , the little brick room waited , in the middle of a parking lot , for Tommy to come back . The law forbade the room , as it forbade the gallows , to be demolished until O'Connor was hanged . It looked like a long wait . P221For it well might be that the little room would be the great city 's most immemorial monument , more lasting than the Art Institute lions on the boulevard , Bushman in his cage near the Lincoln Park Lagoon or Colonel McCormick in his bomb shelter below the river . " Just tryin ' to make a little joke , " Frankie apologized for his reference to skipping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with an unwavering wonder , along the laundered walls . " I think the stuff is almost done , " Applejack confided that night to Frankie after a long visit to the ventilator . " Give it one more day . " With the pungent reek of the stuff on his breath as he spoke . Each man knew the hour . Each man knew the day . Lester had not slept well the night before , the word was going about . He had wakened and played casino with the night screw through the bars . The night screw had taught him the game , the punk had grown to like it . Somebodywho had it right from the night screw himself said that Lester had had one good last laugh at some misplay the guard had made . He 'd been happy because he 'd beaten the guard at the guard 's own game . Yet when the warden had gone to the death cell , the word went around , to read the death warrant , Lester had looked at him without fear and said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this cup of coffee . " Such calmness seemed somehow more terrible to Frankie than if they 'd said Lester was lying on his bunk in a dead-cold nightmare sweating out the hours . Instead he was sitting there killing the hours with cards just as Frankie had killed so many ; while a clock had ticked away below a luminous crucifix . There were no luminous Christs for Lester . Neither Christs nor clocks nor calendars . Yet each man knew the hour . As each man knew the day . But what if the laces broke on the way ? Would he stop to tie them  --  or demand a new pair before he took another step ? It seemed so wrong to trouble tying laces at such an hour , to comb and oil your hair and make corny jokes about going to the dentist 's chair . It seemed so wrong to laugh because you caught a winning deuce against one of the men who was going to help strip you for the cold white slab . To brush your teeth or write a letter to your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tonight , " Frankie reckoned , " he 'll be buried by the time his old lady reads it ' n he knows that when he 's writin ' it P222when he tells the screw to send it air mail ' n seal it good  --  it 's somethin ' personal ! " Would he have to add that same old crack , used twice already in that same cell , " This is certainly going to be a good lesson to me " ? " One more white shirt is all you 'll wear , " Frankie told Lester , though Lester lay many cells away . " Shine your shoes like you 're goin ' to get married . Five 'll get you ten you forget your act when they fit you into them tight black tights . " Frankie lay on his cot half fevered with the idea of Lester 's trip to the chair , suddenly uncertain that he himself had really missed it after all . In his mind Little Lester and himself had merged . " Let 's see you trot through the little white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps to the right ' n now take a load off your feet and do n't let the smell of vinegar bother you either . That 's only a couple drops on your own good you know . Now just put your nose through the little black helmet . That 's right  --  now let 's hear you wisecrack , wise guy . " The wise guy of Frankie 's fantasy had no word that one could hear through that dead-black hood . Some other con , with his own private burden of guilt , cried out , in sleep or waking , and the lights in the corridor seemed to flicker a moment . The sleepers wakened , a long murmur went like a wave from wall to wall . It was that hour when men cried out in voices not their own . For each man knew the hour . As each man knew the day . They said , between the bakery , the laundry and the mess , between the printshop , the library and the little white infirmary , they said he 'd come out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tights shimmering under the lights , that final white shirt buttoned over one shoulder like a fencing master 's , he had stepped forth into that hooded hour . They said it had taken a full minute and a half , from the moment he 'd stepped into the big glass cage to the moment the switch had been pulled . Some said it had taken nearer two . The voltage clamp had required adjustment after he was in the chair and there had been no smell of vinegar after all . They told just how it had been . Between the darkened infirmary and the clean , well-lighted mess , between the sweating boiler room and the cool dry dorm  --  " the leftP223knee kicked up , just once , after the switch was thrown . " The voltage clamp behind the neck had fitted nicely on the very first try  --  only the one on the pale right ankle had seemed a trifle loose  --  but the laces , the laces  --  Frankie had to know  --  had he tied them up first or had he just let them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him so that he would n't trip and skin his knee ? The laces , the laces -- But no one had noticed if the laces were tied at all . The single shoulder button had been stripped off when the shirt had been ripped down to expose the flesh above the poor seared heart . Five doctors  --  which one had pulled the button off ? No  --  it certainly had been six  --  had pronounced the heart as dead as any hustler 's heart can get : a charred lump of ashy flesh that sagged where the living heart had burned . There had been one hundred and twenty men and two women on the witness benches , they said . It had all been spick and span behind the glass , everything had gone off in tiptop order , there had been not even the telltale flickering of the lights throughout the building . Four buttons had been pushed by four unnamed men . They said . Yet only one of these had pushed the live one . None would ever have to think it was himself had sparked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used an amperage of eight , everyone knew , because that was the usual amperage for a white man . Everyone said . Just as the usual amperage for a Negro was seven and a half . Everyone knew . Then they 'd thrown him nine hundred extra volts just to make certain . Everyone knew about that too . Everyone told everyone else just how it had gone off . Everyone but Frankie had been there it seemed . But the laces -- What laces ? You think they let him walk in there with shoes on ? Those tights cover your feet like an acrobat 's tights , there are n't any shoes to it . Just a strip of black cloth sheared neatly halfway around the right ankle . It was n't until weeks after he 'd been released that Frankie learned Little Lester had died on his bunk with eleven hours yet to live . A heart attack , the warden had concluded . Arsenic , the coroner 's physician had insisted . His heart had stopped beating too soon , the afternoon papers had reported . P224And neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prove a thing , one way or another , under any old buffalo of a moon , by flat-nosed , buffalo-eyed Frankie Machine . Now , as the moon of other nights mounted the arch of June , he felt the touch of other Junes along the bars . Remembered how the orange Blatz signs of Wolcott Street would be glowing now each night more softly as the brief month passed trailing smoke , and July came on in a haze . And every arc lamp 's reflection along the rain-wet , moon-wet , sun-wet , and summer-dusted walks would burn more deeply as the days burned longer . Frankie could tell himself at last that he had buried his monkey as deeply as the county had buried Little Lester . Each Saturday afternoon now the good soldiers were led into the yard for a game of softball . Whenever he found himself out there in the open , after the long week in the laundry , he was seized with the need of hearing Molly Novotny 's teasing voice and a longing for the dark appeal of her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another hand of stud in his life or not . Playing first base on the last Saturday in August , he took off his shirt in the fading West Side sunlight and a swift squall , as if waiting all the bright afternoon behind the sentry box for some fool to do just that , swept the field in chilling gusts . By the time they 'd played out the inning he was sneezing and by the time he got back to his cot he was in a wringing sweat . The laundry had weakened his resistance more than he 'd known . By chow time he was rocking down Fever Street in a sidecar attached to some Good Humor vendor 's bicycle , racing east down Division with little pennants whirling in the white-walled wheels and the vendor , wearing a meter reader 's cap and waggling a finger at Frankie to sentencehim to life imprisonment in a broom closet for stealing Captain Bednar 's only electric iron . Sitting upright there among the brooms was good old McGantic wearing a sergeant 's stripes on his sleeve , dead as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The face had withered to a monkey 's face , one dead brown paw pointed to where , upon an empty beer case , lay the same old hypo and two new quarter grains . " If he wants water give him water , " the major was telling Applejack , " and water is all he gets . He 's still tryin ' to kick the habit . Let him sweat it out . If his ticker ai n't bad he 'll make it . "  |p225Intern  Katz understood . He knew how to get a half a cap of morphine out of the infirmary as well as how to fashion a needle out of a common pin . But he believed in Frankie Machine as he believed in his own applejack . " It wo n't be me to put him back on , Major , " he promised . Then he was left to watch alone beside the narrow cot in the narrow little infirmary . Because its looseness seemed to be causing Frankie distress , Katz rolled up the nightshirt 's sleeve . Frankie felt McGantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would fix him forever and for keeps . With all his remaining strength he pried at those fingers to get them off his precious arm . But the fingers had no strength left at all , something that was surely a hypo glinted in the light and in an access of hopeless dread Frankie cried like a sick baby for help : " Molly ! Molly ! " But no Molly was near to reply . Only the sheet roller rumbling down the tier to punish him for what he 'd done to Zosh . He ducked down Schwiefka 's alley and around the shed to pick up an armful of kindling for Jailer . Deep under the wood lay a soft green hat with a small red feather in its brim . Strong hands held him down while others fastened the voltage clamp to the back of his neck but he was too smart for all of them  --  he rested one moment to make them think he had really given in at last and then shouted out of his very bones , " A Polak never gives in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once . But it was all up with Frankie  --  the sponge was pressing his forehead and a voice was warning him through glass  --  " Do n't let your life go with it , Dealer . " He opened his eyes and through the sweat saw Applejack Katz 's good tough mug studying him gravely . And Applejack 's long , hard hand drying the tears , fears and sweat away . " You 're toughin ' it through the hardest sort of way , Dealer , " he heard Katz telling him . " Quit stonin ' yourself . You ai n't that sick . How many guys you fightin ' anyhow ? Be yourself , Dealer . Be yourself . " " That 's not so easy , " Frankie whispered weakly . " I got to get straight first . " " It 's the same thing , " Katz told him quietly . At Applejack 's feet Frankie saw the infirmary 's gray cat sitting upon its haunches . It purred , just once , to affirm Applejack 's counsel . As the fever lowered Frankie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his cot and forced himself awake to see who it was this time.  |p226Only  the old woman of the wind , there on the other side of the pane , wrapping the great sheets of the rain . Indian summer came and September drew toward its close . It closed in a green half-twilight , like the half-twilight of the heart . In this greengraylate September light the Prager beer signs gleamed redly as soon as the arc lamps gleamed yellow . Then the arrows of all the Old Style Lager signs began working anxiously back and forth till the yellow arc lamps dimmed and died , the scarlet Prager bulbs signed off and the overworked Lager arrows went to bed . Only the green-gray light was left , like a light left burning in a hallway entrance all night long . To light the morning 's earliest peddler waking the tenements with one clear call : " Kartofflee ! Karto fflee ! " Then the trolleys , like mild-tempered elephants , approached each other slowly and paused , with a primitive graciousness , to let each other pass ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though the pause had lent each a greater understanding of all things . Frankie came down Division Street , where only arc lamps and fire hydrants grow , wearing the same woolen army trousers and the combat jacket  --  its sleeve patched so neatly , by a county sewing machine , the old tear was scarcely detectable . With a new checkered cap on his head and feeling as if some tightly wound spring within himself had slackened , never to stand taut winding again . Back in the city 's littered bivouac he walked among the tenements of home like an awol private returning to barracks from which his old outfit had long ago convoyed and scattered for keeps . He felt both weakened and strengthened by his stretch . His hands hung heavily , the fingers felt like thumbs for lack of use with deck , cue , dice or drum . But he 'd beaten McGantic and McGantic 's terrible monkey . He 'd paid in full . He did n't have to punish the blood and bone any longer . Molly-O had shown him what was gnawing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the fight . " Once you got the touch it 's always with you , " he remembered , and passed the Safari without looking in . There was no longer anyone there he needed to see . " When a cripple leads a cripple it does n't amount to much , " he recalledsomeone telling him as he turned into his own dark hall . In the dimness someone was shouting threats to someone far above . P227Halfway up the first flight he made out the hulking raincoated figure of Poor Peter Schwabatski pushing an artificial daisy into a crack of the stair . How long was it now he 'd been trying to make them grow there ? Since before that middle tread had come loose , Frankie remembered . When the dimwit had once asked his papa why his flowers never grew , Frankie remembered the Jailer saying , " Because it never rains indoors . " That was a hard thing for Peter to understand . It seemed to him it rained all day indoors . All day it rained in Poor Peter 's mind upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a paper rain . It was the reason he always wore a raincoat , sun or rain ; dust storm , blizzard or summer hail . It was of this same Poor Peter Frankie had heard the Jailer speak mournfully once , after the Jailer had been openly boasting to Violet , " I know how to hit them ovalries : the right one makes a boy , the left one a girl , right square in the middle is what we call a murphydyke . " Where 'd you hit it ? " Violet had asked . " I missed altogether , I guess , " Jailer had acknowledged then with a smile so wan Frankie had wished Vi had n't asked that that time . For the boy had been sitting then where he sat now , moving humbly aside as always for traffic , too absorbed in his dusty flowers to lift his half-bald head . He was not more than twenty but had been losing his hair since he 'd been twelve . As he stepped past Peter Frankie heard Violet and the Jailer really going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Violet was demanding . " Go to sleep , drunk ! Get a wife and hammer in bed ! " " One I had said no hammering on Sunday too , " the Jailer reproved Violet , " she said I hammered enough all week ! " " You 've hammered enough around here too  --  and you ai n't hit a nail yet , " she chided him . " Two years fixing one board ! " " You want to come down and try my board for size now ? " he invited her . " You wo n't mind my hammering after that ! " He sounded a trifle tight all right . " Shame , Schwabatski , " Vi teased him softly , " drinkin ' up that boy 's milk at the bars . " " Leave the helpless children out of this ! " He waved the hammer , pretending to be ready to come up after her . Frankie leaned heavily on the rail , waiting for he did n't know what . For some reason the twenty-watt bulb of the hallway had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visitors ' cage . As he passed the Jailer the old man 's hammer caught him by the claw and hauled him back . " It served that one right , Dealer  --  he went into that business in the wrong neighborhood  --  Polaks do n't need what he was selling . You see : it did n't help him after all to have the devil for a father . " Frankie freed himself and went on up the stairs , but the old man shambled right on up behind him , babbling away till Frankie had to turn on him to get him back to his stairs , his son and his whisky . " You 'll never finish that step runnin ' off at the mouth all day , Jailer , " he urged without anger . The old man took him by the jacket 's sleeve and Frankie looked down into the grizzled , grayish , boozed and wrinkled mug , always so intent on giving fresh heart to all those who seemed to be in need of it . " People like that ought to be knocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd overheard Frankie 's threat to Louie one night . " Do n't torture yourself ! Myself would of give you this hammer ! Myself would have done it ! Do n't torture ! Do n't suffer ! " The old man was pleading so , two steps there below , he seemed to be pleading on his knees . Frankie took the big veined hand and felt his own fingers ' weakness in the old man 's grip . " All I done was a little stealin ' , Jailer , " he told the old man softly . " Now I done my time for that , so let 's forget what ca n't be helped no more . All sorts of things happen and then it 's done and the less we talk about it now the better for me ' n everybody . " It was the assurance the old man needed , he sensed Frankie had found some degree of peace and let him go at last . Frankie saw him return , with a pencil behind his ear and a ruler sticking out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daisies . Overhead he heard Violet return back down the hall without a greeting . That was n't like Vi at all . " She 's gone to tell the punk I 'm back , " he guessed . " You heard what I said all the same , " the old man mumbled , through two nails clenched in his teeth as he squatted on the step . " Knocked on the head ! With this same hammer ! " Then the hammer 's rapid tapping , light and sane and calm , a good carpenter 's hammering , like the beat of a lightened heart . The Jailer felt better for having unburdened himself . Frankie could tell . But how long it had been since the old man had first wished to speak out Frankie could only surmise .   " The old man got good heart , " Frankie told himself . Everyone , even those who left doors ajar just to bait him a bit , knew the old man had the truest sort of heart . It was only that there was so little demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaped like valentines are n't at all the fashion . What is more in demand are hearts with a bit of iron  --  and a twist to the iron at that . A streamlined heart , say , with a claw like a hammer 's claw , better used for ripping than for tapping at old repairs  --  that 's what 's needed to get by these days . It 's the new style in hearts . The non-corrugated kind do n't wear well any longer . Hearts with a twist to the iron  --  that 's what makes a good hustler 's heart . Behind the narrow yellow door bearing the red tin 29 he himself had nailed there , Frankie heard the old clock below the crucifix tick once  --  warningly  --  and pushed in without knocking . Sophie sat with her head thrown back and eyes closed , looking debauchedin the dim tenement light . Apparently assuming it was only that nosy Violet again , she said tonelessly , " You come in yourself this morning , did you ? You only sent things yesterday . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days . It did n't look as if it had been swept in a month ; cigarette butts , Kleenex , bottles and hairpins littered the floor . The walls had grown darker . Her scrapbook lay on her lap . " You pastin ' pictures , Zosh ? " he asked . She opened her eyes , smiled wanly and lifted her hands listlessly toward him . The gesture told him she had known it was himself in the doorway all the time , that she had been playing some strange game with herself alter hearing his voice on the stairs , pretending she had not heard anyoneat all . Yet he held both her hands in his . He had seen so many weary homecomings at the Pulaski . Till her fingers began to work like small claws upon his palms . " You 're stronger than you were , " he told her . For her hands seemed to have gained a chilly ferocity all their own . They felt so cold , so cold . He dropped them gently and went behind her chair to rock her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she told him thinly , " you learned your lesson . God punished you . Always be nice after this fer what you done . " P230Violet 's voice at the open door : " When did that sonofabitch break out ? " Frankie saluted her from where he stood . " Hi , Sergeant  --  come on in  --  but do n't bring your army . " For the punk 's shadow fell behind her . " He did n't mean no harm , Frankie , " Violet pleaded for him like a mother for a wayward child , " he just got scared ' n run . " " Then he can keep on running  --  right back up them steps . He 's got somebody 's nice fat bankroll up there to count and he 's gon na get plenty of time to count it . I 'm goin ' back to work by Schwiefka tonight ' n that mocky ai n't workin ' no door where I 'm dealin ' . I 'm the guy who got him the job ' n I 'm the guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first thing I 'm doin ' t'night , it:ll be my first good deed for society . " He heard Sparrow retreat as softly as he had come . As though knowingfor months that that would be Frankie 's answer . He 'd run like a scalded dog all right , no two ways about it . " What makes him so brave ? " Frankie asked Vi with heavy irony . " He ai n't got a bad conscience about anythin ' , has he ? " But Violet was gone , to console or upbraid her sparrow , and Zosh was waiting for him to turn toward her so that everything could begin again , just like it used to be . " Your bonus dough is gone , Frankie , " was her opening shot . " I tried to make it last . The last two monts I been livin ' off yer disability dough  --  ' n even then I had to borrow a double sawbuck off Vi I ai n't been able to pay back . " " " You do n't have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it come from where I think it come from . " " She said it was Old Man 's insurance dough , " Zosh told him , " but the way she 's actin ' I do n't care if I pay her back either . You really goin ' back to work so soon , Frankie ? " " Just till I get back on my feet , " he assured her . " I 'm out for a real job , Zosh . Beatin ' them tubs . I 'm gon na be a drummer just like I always said . " Then he noticed that no Rumdum crouched beneath the dresser . " Where 's the hound ? " he wanted to know . " Vi took him , she got more room . How could I take care of him all day here by myself ? He did n't like me anyhow . Why do n't you get me a nice little puppy-pup , Frankie ? You said you would . You promised . " So nothing had really changed after all . She would own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He would practice every night . P231But she 'd seen spurts of golden hope in him before . It would wear off now as it always had . He 'd be back dealing where he ought to be and she 'd be sitting where she ought to be and everything would be just the way it had been , just as it ought always to be . He was pulling the practice board out from under the sink and brushing the months of dust off its scars and dents and picking up the sticks to get the feel of them again . Then put them down gently , for he saw she was nodding where she sat , the brief half sleep of invalidism . " Let 's do like regular people now , " she murmured , as though in sleep . " Like regular people ' n go by the Aragon . " He stood behind her chair with his hands on the wood , ready to wheel her if she wakened . Then , as her head nodded , told her softly : " Have a good dream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' again . " He could not see the trace of a smile that strayed so knowingly across her lips . Neither the Tug &; Maul nor the Safari saw Molly Novotny any more . She had drifted into the vast web of backstreet and alleyway , crosslightand traffic warning , of the overnight hotels and those little namelessrestaurants that bum all night under the single sign : GOOD EATS . " She 's workin ' in some boog honky-tonk , " Antek told Frankie . " Ask Meter Reader , he 's the guy who goes out scoutin ' . " Frankie waited half a day for Meter Reader to show up , and got only the vaguest sort of information for his patience . " All I remember is a cat settin ' on a piano . I was so boiled I do n't know where I was . But I remember talkin ' to Drunk John 's girl . She was a little boiled herself . " So all nights ended for Frankie now with a firm resolution , renewed each morning , to scout around Lake and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found him in the dealer 's slot and he could n't afford to miss a single night : he had to get a small stake together . He could n't come to Molly broke and begging . Yet the week ran out on Saturday night and he was no richer than he 'd been on Monday morning . The old merry-go-round was rolling again and he had to ride as hard as any . Once more the yellow arc lamps bloomed in the shadow of the El . Pumpkin-colored posters appeared in the bakers ' windows among the round brown loaves of morning , announcing that Mickey Michaels ' Melody Masters would play at St. Wenceslaus Kostka Saturday evening for the Endless Belt Invincibles S.A.C.P232In front of Piechota 's Poultry &; Fresh Eggs Market a single gander stood gawking between its legs at a cord that forever held it fast . Umbrella Man came in to Schwiefka 's every noon with the Times morning line crumpled in his pocket , the daily double checked off and fifty cents in his hand . He never won and never complained . He came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bets like a man paying a bill , and left with the relieved air of one who has settled a long-overdue debt . The only return he seemed to expect was the privilege of climbing the same stairs and trying again another day . He was n't permitted to climb those stairs after the last race had been run . Since Frankie had been gone Cousin Kvorka had forbade him to sit in any poker game . So that , after his fifty-cent bet was made , UmbrellaMan spent the evening drinking instead of playing poker . By the next noon , as often as not , he would still be weaving a bit . It was said that he had taken to begging secretly for drinks at Widow Wieczorek 's . That though he never begged anywhere with his lips , for fear of Cousin Kvorka , he managed to pick up a beer or two at the Widow 's simply by using his eyes to express his need . " The gray cat 's purred for Umbrellas , " Frankie heard Antek say . All things remained the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the short-card sign waiting to bring up coffee and cigarettes for the players . Blind Pig spent his nights in the Safari now and lived in the room where Louie had lived , among Louie 's abandoned possessions . " I 'm takin ' all I can get , " Pig reassured the troubled ghost of Louie Fomorowski . For Louie 's old customers still found their way : they came now with cold , hard silver . Pig would n't touch folding money . " I ca n't get nobody to give me a square count , " he complained of everybody . The Prager legend above the Tug &; Maul still came on at the same moment every night . Above the bar mirror , and all down Owner 's wall , hung fresh ads for Budweiser , Chevalier , Nectar and Schlitz . As if in honor of Frankie 's return . And why was it , Frankie wondered , getting his own little beer paunch back , that the faces in Owner 's ads were always so clean and healthy and wholesome and glad ? There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own cleverness in having kept two bottles of some green offgrade brew in the icebox in event of company : evidently she was one of the few women in Cook County who had heard of beer . For her husband 's enthusiasm over such foresight scarcely knew bounds.  |p233Beside  her was some usurer togged out in woodsman 's gear , preparing an enormous t-bone  --  where had that come from ?  --  over a smokeless fire in a clean green land of night-blue lakes and birch trees so straight and tall they looked like ivory-tipped cues . " He must of gone up there ' n shot it hisself , " Frankie decided , missing the entire point of the ad , which was simply to take note of the cold beer mug waiting in the blanket-roll by that smokeless fire . Down the line a pink-cheeked , overstuffed illiterate with a shot glass at his side looked benignly down , over volumes heaped by a cynical photographer , upon the barflies of the Tug &; Maul who actually drank the stuff . The barflies returned his gaze , from time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their sight that they thought , as often as not , that the man in the private library was Errol Flynn . This freshly blooded race bred by the better advertising agencies looked down upon the barflies of the Tug &; Maul , trying to understand how it was that these battered wrecks could look as though not one of them had ever seen a land of night-blue lakes with poolroom cues for trees . Nor any man 's private library at all . They appeared not even to have discovered the public ones . ' There were only boys with bad teeth , wives with faces still dented from last night 's blows and girls whose hair was set so stiffly it looked metallic . There were only old drooling lushbums with faces like emptied goboons . There was only a long line of faces that had passed straight from the noseless embryo into the running nose of senility . And had seen no birch tree at all . " I got to get a lib'ry card myself , " Frankie determined . That was only one of several matters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the business of getting a job on the legit so that he could break clean with Zosh instead of running off like some sneaking punk . He was going to start on that the minute he finished his shot  --  he finished it . And was right on the verge of getting up to look up a certain name in the telephone directory five feet from where he sat  --  a name that had been told to him once , right in here , of a party who could put a man to work on the drums with or without a union card . But just at that moment he noticed that Antek 's glasses had been broken while he 'd been gone . " What happened to the goggles , Owner ? " he asked urgently , needing to know the answer right away . Antek made no reply . He felt he was being razzed and walked off with the string tied over one ear and knotted to the stump of the glasses '  |p234frame  . Antek suffered occasional defeats , and these humiliated him more deeply than blows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come under fire . She came gimping across the floor on three legs and somebody 's hound , on a leash , made a run for her . Antek 's wife , holding the leash , let the hound go just far enough to make the old cat scramble for it on all threes . " The old cat 's no good , " Mrs. Owner explained herself righteously , " she 's the one what trampled her young ones to deaf  --  somebody ought to give it to her good for that . " A dull compassion for all old cats hit Frankie . " She did it to make room for her next litter , " he told the woman . So just to show everyone how she felt she hollered , " Get her , Bummy ! " and let the leash go altogether . The old cat barely made it , half crawling and half slipping up the piled beer cases to safety . And the old bums drooled and drooled . Frankie turned away . It seemed that everything that ever happened to him had begun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the traffic warnings flashed from red to green and back again . In the bar mirror he saw the door open and Sparrow wander in pretendinghe was n't looking for anyone in particular . Then just happen to spot an old buddy who had n't been around for a while . " Hi , Dealer , " he sounded Frankie out from the front of the bar , signaling to Antek for two shots . Frankie let his shot stand before him without even acknowledging that he 'd seen anyone come in . But out of the corner of his eye , turned toward the mirror , he studied the punk as never before . So this was the joker for whom he 'd done nine months in County . " He left me holdin ' the bag for sure that time , " Frankie reminded himself firmly ; so that he 'd never , never weaken . Sparrow leaned over the bar to Antek , whispered confidentially , and a minute later Antek ambled down toward Frankie with a far too casual air . " He wants to talk to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gettin ' back on the door by Schwiefka . Says you got him awfully wrong about somethin ' . " " If a guy wants a job by Schwiefka , " Frankie said loudly enough for the punk to hear , " let him go by Schwiefka . I do n't run no joint , I 'm just dealin ' . " P235Antek , duty done , reported back to Sparrow and the punk picked up his courage at last . Catching Frankie 's eye in the mirror , he asked , in a small peaked voice , " You still got them hard feelin 's , Dealer ? " " I got no kind of feelin 's . " " It was n't no sense bot ' of us gettin ' busted , Frankie . " " No sense at all , " Frankie agreed readily . " Who 's arguin ' ? " Frankie certainly was n't . It was all over and done so far as Dealer was concerned . He turned on the stool , leaving the shot the punk had bought him with his last two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sparrow plucked pleadingly at Frankie 's sleeve . " Let me talk to you , Frankie . " Frankie looked down at him . The punk was looking shabby all right . And a bad time of year for dog stealing . " There 's lots of things I got wrong awright , " he told the punk , " but you ai n't one of ' em . You 're the one thing I 'm real right about . " He turned up his jacket against the evening cold and left without looking back . Each morning now the tide of his loneliness rose , to ebb only when he took his evening place in the slot . To rise a bit higher , by the following morning , than it had the morning before . If it had n't been for the punk , it somehow seemed , he 'd be on the legit now somewhere with Molly instead of still hustling suckers all night long . His eyes , under the nightlight , no longer reflected the light . It 's all in the wrist , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the touch . The feel of the deck was n't there any more . And it had all been better before . He practiced squeezing a sponge ball one evening . " Tunney stren'thened his hands like this , " he explained to Sophie . And fancied the fingers felt stronger . He gave the sports a shaky deal three nights running . On the fourth he settled down . Till , toward morning , one sport sat with a low straight and three others drew to two pairs . The second player 's final card slipped face upward , matching the pair of sixes already showing on the board . Frankie reddened and gave the others theirs face upward too , with a mumbled " sorry " to the one whose hand he had so clumsily betrayed , a youth known to him only as Bird Dog . Four players turned up their cards with real relief ; the dealer hadP236saved them money from home . But Bird Dog shoved the pot toward Frankie . " You won this one , Dealer , " Bird Dog assured him , slapping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicate he was casing out , and tossed two bits of his own into the pot . " You win that too . " " Take your money , Bird Dog , " Frankie begged off , " it 's yours . " " No hard feelings , " the boy assured him with a flat little laugh . Everyone watched him leave while Frankie boxed the deck , pretending it had all been the fault of the cards , and opened a fresh deck . The pot stayed in the middle for the next hand 's winner . His palms were sweating and the deck , that had always slipped so lightly , seemed half glued to them . On the very first go-round with the fresh deck he dealt a card to the missing player 's empty seat and the cards had to be shifted all around the board . Schwiefka put his hand on Frankie 's arm with a meaningful touch . " Go down ' n get a drink , Dealer . You 're dealin ' like you got hairs in your teet ' . I fired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frankie shoved back the chair , slapped on his cap , and all the way to the door fancied small laughter behind him . And right in the downstairs doorway , just as though he did n't know he 'd ever been fired , the punk was waiting again . " How long you been waitin ' for nothin ' ? " Frankie wanted to know . A cold wind came down the alley and the punk blew on his hands . " A long time , Frankie . Get me my job back . I 'm broke . " " You always were , " Frankie reminded him . When he reached the Tug &; Maul Sparrow hustled in right behind him and stood watching while Frankie ordered a double shot for himself . His right hand was shaking so that he had to lift the glass with his left . Anybody 's hand would shake , having a punk shadow him all night . The punk must be practicing to be a Pinkie again . He kept the hand in his pocket . He had two doubles before it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there tonight , Frankie ? " The punk sounded homesick all right . " You got to get back up there right away ? " " I do n't got to go nowheres right away . " When Frankie ordered a third double shot Sparrow sensed that something had gone wrong in the slot . Frankie stuck to coffee between shifts when things were going as they should . " Ai n't you goin ' back upstairs all night , Frankie ? " And felt a faint little twinge of hope that , just maybe , Frankie had been fired too .   " Not tonight ' r any night . Nobody 's stairs . I 'm gon na try downstairs awhile . " The hand was fine now , steady as a die . " I 'm gon na find out what 's doin ' in the basement . " " You still got rent to pay , " Sparrow reminded him meekly . Frankie turned on him . " It looks to me like you 're fallin ' behind in yours , " he accused the punk , looking him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so thin at the knees to the coat that had once been old Stash 's : it still bore the marks of an ice tongs faintly visible across the left shoulder . " You look like Vi has fired you too , " he threw in . " I 'll get my own racket . " Sparrow tried , at the last possible moment , to salvage something of his pride . " It 's pretty cold for rollin ' stiffs , " Frankie observed . Sparrow saw then it was no use ; no use at all . He was n't even good for a shot with Frankie any more . " What 's yours ? " Sparrow really wanted to know . " What 's yours ? " And did n't stay for an answer . Frankie saw his tattered coat catch in the door as it closed behind him , then the punk extricated himself and was gone into the November night . " It was toward this time of year I first hooked up with him , " Frankie remembered with a heart homesick for many Novembers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house , " he told Frankie , and poured evenly for both the dealer and himself . Frankie shoved a half dollar toward Antek . He was n't so hard up as some people seemed to think . " See that sign of yours ? " he asked , pointing to one of the bar legends ; Our cow is deadWe do n't need your bull " Well , " Frankie told Owner , " my cow 's dead too . So do n't gim me none of your bull . Just give me a square count on my change . " And spat , slowly and provocatively , making a great show of the act , between his knees and down to the floor at his feet . Antek was hurt . He 'd only been trying to patch things up between a couple old buddies and this was what he got . He withdrew the bottle and his own glass , returned with change for the half dollar and said , " Suit yourself , Dealer . " Then spat , just as slowly , just as provocatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spittin ' ? " Frankie laughed with a huge contempt , hawked once and blew a beautiful round gob straight over the bar top238splash across the mirror where the photographs of Antek 's wife and daughter hung in gilt-edged frames . Antek picked up a sodden bar towel and slung it straight into Frankie 's face . Frankie wiped his face absent-mindedly with the rag precisely as though it had been handed to him politely for just that purpose . " After all , Frankie , " Antek apologized in all humility , " a bartender got feelin 's too . " Then saw that Frankie was crying . Antek watched this spectacle a minute , figuring something slowly to himself . Frankie handed him back the towel . " I 'll say this much about somethin ' that 's none of my business at all , " Antek told him , measuring each word as though fearing to say one word too many . " I think you 're dead wrong about the punk . That 's all . " And turned away . So it really had been Pig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had been Owner who 'd given Pig " some kind of count " on Louie 's roll . Then his pride came up to deny flatly what all his senses had told him at last . If he 'd been wrong this long he 'd just stay wrong . If the punk had gone , let him go . Let everyone , let all of them go . It was too hard to get slapped in the teeth with a wet bar towel twice in a row . He did n't tell Sophie of his determination to quit Schwiefka . Why hang on ? He did n't even tell Schwiefka . The whole day following the night of the shaky deal he lay on the bed waiting for the old strength to return , in a single jump , to his wrists . He lay fully clothed , with his cap in easy reach of his hand ; as though in order to be ready to go back to work the moment the touch returned . But the feel of the deck had died with the light that had died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a loneliness for more than any lost skill . More than a loneliness for careless nights when he and the punk had first gone on drunks together . More even than the gnawing need for Molly-O . A loneliness that took on substance and form , like a crouching man wearing some sort of faded , outworn uniform . He was lonely all right . He was lonely for his old buddy with the thirty-five-pound monkey on his back . Neither Sophie nor Sergeant McGantic wanted him to practice at the board any more . She sat by the window and McGantic roamed theP239long , cold hall . It had been some hours since she had spoken . It had been some time since McGantic had called . But toward the end of the afternoon she began telling him of all the things he had missed when he 'd been gone . She had seen a movie about " Jack London in the Klondikes " and another wherein Joan Crawford had changed hats without a change of scene . " I 'm gon na write to Screenlandabout that , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bucks for movie boners they call them . " She never wrote . But had added several morbid memories to the fiveand-dimeloose-leaf volume , her Scrapbook of Fatal Accidence . Yet there were long hours between them now when the book lay open on her lap and she had no word to say . As if realizing at last that there was really nothing for her to do in the world . No true place of her own at all . Nothing to do but to wait . For what ? For the booby hatch or a miracle , she did n't much care which . " Why do n't Vi come to see me no more , just to say , How you feelin ' ? ' like she used ? " she suddenly demanded to know . " She 's havin ' trouble with the punk is why , " he answered , not knowinghimself just what he meant . " Vi is up to somethin ' , " he guessed indifferentlyand let it go at that . Thus Sophie knew , more clearly with each hour , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in secret league against her . Violet and Frankie , Owner and Jailer , just the same as they 'd been before Frankie had gone away ; the overnight guests and creaky old Pin Curls down the fourth floor rear who played , over and over , just to get Sophie 's goat , the same old creaking tune : " Painted lips , painted eyes , Wearing a Bird-of-Paradise . . . " " You only make the same mistake once , " she advised him abruptly . " Whatever that means , " he answered mechanically . " Oh , do n't always pertend you do n't know what I 'm talkin ' about , " she persisted , " a woman is the downfall of every man ' n a man is the downfall of every woman . You 're my downfall ' n I 'm yours . " " Quit fallin ' down ' n say what you 're tryin ' to say , " he urged her irritably , " quit beatin ' around the bushes . " " What I mean is there 's nuttin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sternly , " nuttin ' deader . "   " Sure there is , " he assured her lightly , " dead people . They 're deader'n anybody . " IIer reply was simply to weave her hands in front of her face like a Hawaiian dancer and to sing saucily : " Hello , Aloha , how are you ? I 'm bringin ' you kisses From over the sea . " She watched him slyly while they ate a cold-cut supper out of paper plates . There was n't enough strength left in her wrists , she claimed , to slice bread or cut sausage . She watched while he cut everything into small cubes for her and then sat weaving her hands instead of eating . " Others you 've metMay call you coquette . . . " " Quit yawpin " n scoff , " he told her , " you sound like a lost orphan in a rain barrel . " For now she fancied herself a vocalist with an all-girl band . Over the sausage she smiled faintly at the unseen players , encouraging one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was something really distracted about her smile . " What the hell are you  --  a bird ? " But his eyes were clouded with concern for her . " Evelyn ' n her magic violin , " Sophie explained easily . " I can do magic too . " Well , " he sighed , realizing he was in for a long , long night , " here we go again . " . . . mean to me " she sang , " Why must you be mean to me ? " and broke off abruptly to ask directly , " What do you think of the A. F. of L. ? " Frankie looked up , genuinely startled . " What the hell  --  you do n't even know what the A. F. of L. is . I think you 're tryin ' to act crazier just ' cause I 'm back . If nobody was here you 'd have more sense . Quit disguisin ' your eyes . Quit showin ' off . " But whether she was just showing off or not he could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was dozing and wakened to see her tracing , with one forefinger upon the dust of the unwashed pane , the single word : Perdition . Just as she finished tracing it the sirens sounded , the hook-and-ladder pulled past and patrol cars , insurance cars and all the frantic traffic of a 4-11 alarm came crashing by with a sense of imminent doom . She wheeled to the door and shrieked up the stairwell to Violet , " It 's goin ' up ! Loop ' n all ! It 's all goin ' up ! " Violet came down the stairs at a gallop ; she had to phone the papers to learn what was burning , how far it was spreading , and a kind of elationseized Sophie while Vi was at the phone behind Jailer 's desk . " It 's just a short circuit by Fish Furniture 's basement , " Vi reported dryly from the doorway . " All under control . " But Sophie herself stayed out of control the rest of the evening . Neither magazines nor scrapbook nor the promise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that that was all it had come to , that that was all anything could ever come to . Just the way Vi had said that  --  it made a person want to cry , that was all . " The whole fire was in my head , " she mourned . He left for Schwiefka 's toward eleven o'clock . There was no other way to make the long night pass . And wondering , the minute he sat down in the slot , how in the name of sweet Jesus Christ he was going to make it without a charge till morning . Solly Saltskin was n't as happy , sleeping in the late Stash Koskozka 's bed , as he 'd once thought he 'd be . If he could , occasionally , have slept there alone it might have been endurable . Sneaking in for an hour of fast woo a couple times a week when Old Husband had still been paddingabout had been one thing : being tied down to these same four bedposts all night long , night after night , was strictly something else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a faintly disapprovingair . They 'd seen them come and they 'd seen them go : this one would n't last as long as some of the others , they calculated , the reckless way he was going about things . A cooler head was what was needed ; a cooler head , an older hand , a bit more restraint and snatches of sleep between rounds . But Vi was so hothanded he did n't get a chance either to sleep or even to cool off between rounds . Once he evaded her senseless stroking with some such thin excuse as , " I 'm just gon na have a fast cup of coffeep242in the kitchen  --  you go to sleep , you need your rest , you 're gettin ' to look like a wornout movie actor . " But just as he was putting the cup to his lips her fingers encompassed his throat from behind and he squawked like a strangling duck . " Do n't do that when you see I 'm swallerin ' , " he protested . " That 's when it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you did n't even hear me creepin ' up , did you , Goosey ? Still love me , Goosey-Goo ? " And crushed down upon his lap to feed him coffee from a Pixley &; Ehlers spoon , howling with joy at his every wretched gulp . " You look so unhappy , Goosey . " She never ran out of new nicknames for him , each more revolting than the last . " Ai n't there enough sugar in it ? Now tell me I 'm sweet enough for you , you do n't need sugar with me settin ' here . " All Sparrow had heart enough left to say was , " Let me up , Vi . I do n't know what 's gettin ' into you lately , you did n't use to be like this all the time . " She did n't give him time to figure out a thing . She chirped kisses upon him instead . In time to the coffee 's steady perking . " The coffee 's perkin ' over , Vi . " He never remembered for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for leaving her door a bit ajar . She let him up at last and , as he turned , shaken , to the percolator , goosed him with a single loonlike warning  --  whoop ! He went clean off the floor on the point of her thumb , half a foot into the air , staggered hysterically into the wall and wheeled like a wounded rabbit to get his back up against something solid and looked at her in a panting despair , awaiting some final blow . " Never do that , " he warned her weakly , hysteria darkening his eyes . " Never do that ' n never call me that . " " Wait 'll I get you in bed , " she consoled him . " I 'll make it all up to you , Goosey-joosey . " And followed him mercilessly all the way back to the bedroom , breathing on his neck and tossing her flaming henna helmet about like a conquering lion 's mane . He had been an entertainingtoy in his time  --  but how could a girl afford a toy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stray nickel left lying loosely about ? He was n't weakening nearly as fast as had Old Husband , who 'd given out entirely at the end of the first week . Sparrow only seemed to be a bit frayed around the edges . And the rent three weeks overdue . Somebody had to go . P243And she did n't mean Rumdum . " You do n't know how I miss Old Man , now he 's gone , " she tried for some reason to convince the punk , " you do n't have no idea how sweet that old man could be when he wanted . " " Do n't come on with the cheap romance , " the punk scolded her . " You married him for his fifty a week ' n all you miss is that fifty . " " Well , " she admitted , " he was n't as much fun as you . You 're the most fun I ever had with pants on , " she flattered him with a knowing nudge . " You ' n your bedroom eyes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had with ' em off , " he agreed dismally . " ' N just to think , " she went on breathlessly , " I 'm all yours , Goosey Lover . " " Do n't call me that , it sounds like goosey liver . " But what he really felt was that she was n't all his so much as he was all hers and that there was no rest for the weary . It was n't just coincidence that her favorite tune about the house , day after day , began to be : " All of me , Why not take all of me ? " He devised a more subtle means of evading her than that of the midnightsnack . It was too easy for her to seduce him right there on the kitchen floor to the tune of the percolator 's perking . He took to heading for the bathroom . " Do n't , Vi , " he 'd plead , as she 'd drag him off the bed 's edge down into the sweaty sheets . " Do n't  --  I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed Rumdum listened with sympathy ; and a dull foreboding . She 'd relent then . For five minutes . Then he 'd hear her making for the bathroom door ; he 'd grasp the knob firmly  --  there was no lock  --  and haul back like a crazed paralytic while she 'd pull , shrieking at her discovery of this new game , on the other side of the knob . Once , drowsing contentedly on the can beside the little five-watt bulb glimmering above the paper holder in the tiny darkened cavern , he understood , dreamily , Old Husband 's love of the broom closet and failed to hear her tiptoed approach  --  when she rattled the board above his head he almost went into shock . " Go back to bed , " he begged , " for God 's sake , " but she fetched him in an iron grip , pants dragging and the plumbing 's antique roar in his ears , flat down upon the cold linoleum . P244While Rumdum galloped excitedly about them , nipping their heels . Ten minutes later he rolled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head . " Pull up the shade , Goosey , " she ordered him , " let 's see if it 's gettin ' light . " " If I pull up the shade I 'll go up with it , " he recalled the ancestral burlesque retort without humor . " I know now what they mean by mortal coil , ' " he decided to himself , " ' cause I got one I got to shuffle off before they haul me out of here with my toes turned up . " Twelve weeks of their hot-breathed union and the mornings were finding him faint . The punk woke to his ninetieth common-law dawn , on the first day of December , feeling he 'd never make the ninety-first . He rose like a haunted ghost , washed in cold water and took one last fond look at the friendly percolator : that had revived him many an ardent midnight and now would revive him no more . Beneath the sink Rumdum slept with one ear alert for the coffeepot 's first perk . Vi was trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the chance , even now , of putting the pot on the stove . She wakened to its contented perking as to some slow aphrodisiac and the time was come to go . He found three halves , wrapped in a ten-dollar bill , in her apron . The last of Old Husband 's insurance money , and a pang of conscience flicked him . " So long as she do n't shoot herself when she finds out I ducked on her , " he hoped anxiously . " Maybe she 'll get over the shock some day . " And left as if it had been the percolator he had loved here so long and so well ; it was all he truly regretted leaving . He could not know that even then Violet lay wide awake and listening to his every secret move , scarcely daring to breathe for fear he might change his mind . " If he decides to hang on any longer I 'll have to hurt his feelin 's , that 's all , " she determined firmly . " I 'll have to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She heard the door shut ever so softly and turned over on her side with the sighing relief of a job well done . " I always wanted to get out of this crummy neighborhood anyhow , " Sparrow rationalized going downstairs . " One more winter with Vi ' n I 'd be tearin ' all my pieces off the calendar too . " He went past Frankie 's door noiselessly these days ; there was no use trying to talk to the dealer any more . " When a Polak gets an idea in his head you ca n't get it out wit ' a crowbar , " Sparrow decided ruefully . P245And so returned , with the city a golden roar in his ears , to the horseand-wagonalleys of his childhood ; with a rueful renascence in his heart . For the alleys never changed . It was as though no time had passed since he had first escaped down them : playing hooky from that first truant officer as he was on the hook from Violet now . It seemed the same morning of golden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had been kinder to him than the streets . He had spent those long-ago days searching the ashcans for the tinfoil in discarded cigarette packs . Though the boulevardgutters had been better for tinfoil prospecting , the alleys had always been safer . The tinfoil racket had been abandoned for the pursuit of beer corks . A still on Blackhawk Street had paid a dime a hundred for them in those days . Beer corks were money : they were lagged , in lieu of pennies , along the sidewalk cracks . One red beer cork was worth five of the common brown-and-white rootbeer variety , and once Sparrow had hoarded a pearl beyond price : an orange-and-green job with an owl engraved upon it . No one in the neighborhood had ever seen one like it , he was offered as high as a hundred to one , in rootbeer tops , for it . Then he 'd lost it out of a hole in his pocket and it had left a ragged little hole in his heart . " Five up ! " He recalled how the lagger 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lagger nearest the line had gotten first toss  --  five from each player  --  and could keep all that turned up heads . He could then toss them one at a time or all at once just as the whim took him . Then the runner-up got second toss and by the time tossings came around to Solly Saltskin there was usually only one left anyhow and that his by default , there were no other tossers . But he 'd toss it anyhow , just because the others had ; it was n't often there was anyone farther off the line than Solly . Even then he had always been last . The decisive crack in the sidewalkhad always , somehow , seemed farther away to him than it had to the other alley stubs . Even then he had blinked and goggled and furrowedhis forehead and bit his tongue in tossing while those who lagged easily did the winning . Twenty years  --  and he still put his face too close to others when he spoke , still peered hopefully through double-lensedlasses as if trying to see whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Solly . P246Still sauntered down the one-way alleys between Division Street and the Armitage Avenue carbarns with some forgotten eye of childhood alert for anything that might be turned into a spot of cash . The sights and sounds of the alleyways by morning were different for Sparrow than those of the boulevards and the car lines . He heard them as familiarly as a nature lover hears murmurs of a forest morning . The clomp-clomp of Western Dairy steeds and the clatter of tardy milkmen up back stairs and down two steps at a time , the newsboy wheeling down a gangway on a bicycle and the morning greeting of the rolled paper thudding neatly and accurately against the wrong door , the odor of fresh rolls off the bakery truck  --  home sights , home sounds and home smells for Solly Saltskin . He stole a copy of the Tribune off some newsboy 's two-wheeled cart and two chocolate-covered bismarcks off a bakery truck , just to feel freedom returning to his shaken spirit . " I may die poor , " he felt with his returning strength , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not for me , the common-law life . " And fed the second doughnutto Bogacz the Milkman 's horse . " You married , horse ? " Sparrow asked in his rasping whisper . The old stallion rolled one white , derisive eye : he saw so many of this aimless order of alley wanderers , forever emerging out of the shadows to feed him stolen restaurant sugar or doughnuts or salt he did n't really want . He took them only because he sometimes got lonely himself over the week ends . Though knowing there are worse things than loneliness along the long hard road to the glue works . Sparrow heard the milkman 's container tinkling somewhere behind him and a hangover of guilt , from some half-forgotten caper among some other milkie 's quarts and pints , caught him and he crossed the avenue to scurry down the opposite alley . Toward noon he spotted a likely-looking terrier frolicking by itself in a yard behind a chili parlor . He had it wagging its stump of a tail , his hand on its collar  --  worth a dollar-fifty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an overweight gorilla in an apron stained with chili like freshly spattered blood and a meat cleaver in one paw , surveying him silently from behind the screened doorway . Sparrow cooed swift love words at the pup and fed it an invisible dog biscuit  --  the screen door opened and again he ran for it . When he glanced back the cook was leaning over the fence , cleaver dangling and the whole man measuring him for future decapitation.  |p247S|parrow  did n't linger : the incident had proven to him that the heydayof dog stealing was gone with the miniature golf courses and Star and Garter burlesque . There was no sort of living left in the alleys , it seemed . It was all on the streets nowadays . He had been dependent upon Frankie and Violet too long . Where would he go when the sawbuck out of Vi 's apron was gone ? he wondereduneasily . It looked like a long cold winter for Solly Saltskin . He caught up on his sleep curled up on the Widow Wieczorek 's pool table , curtained off from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a pillow . The Widow had been widowed so long she 'd cut her hair short and grown a mustache . She did n't mind one of the boys sleeping on the table if he lifted a couple with her first . She shook him awake toward two o'clock and he idled the rest of that bright afternoon away watching Gringo Guns in the roaring darkness of the Pulaski . When he came out the evening light lay like a dreamer with sunburnedflanks across the dreaming city : water towers , steeples and rooftops , all lay adrift in an amber sea ; till the wind below began to search , in hallway and alley and yard , for the place where pale night was hiding . A wind that stirred nothing else than a kite caught on a telephone wire . A kite of such a darkling red , with that lowering orange sun behind it flooding the heart-shaped wound where the wires ran it through , that it looked to be bleeding . The merciless city wires , upon which it tried to turn a bit , first this way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that enormous wound . Sparrow watched it flutter up there with the first rumors of evening , and his own heart pinked with the wind . The frail cross of the kite 's frame hung as piteously as his own heart had hung , since Frankie had gone to jail , to the taut and insulated steel . Goggling upward at it , shivering a bit in the shabby coat , he felt for a moment as if he too were something impaled on city wires for only tenement winds to touch . He had nine dollars left in his pocket and knew just the place to build it up to forty . All you needed to sit in on a stud session at Kippers was a five-dollar bill on the board before you . " I could lick them rag sheenies every day ' n twice on Yom Kippur , " he decided , taking the alleys toward Damen and Division . He took a seat at the corner table , folding his nine singles to look like eighteen and declared himself casually  --  " from the pocket "  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wallet . It was sevencard , two down , four open and the last one closed and he did n't glance at the closed pair till the first open card hit him : two blood-red jacks hiding just as the third jack slid in face up to meet its relations . Three J-boys wired , this was Solly Saltskin 's night . He glanced one suspicious second at the dealer , saw he was just some run-of-the-mill houseman and that three jacks were just luck for one punk whose luck , God knew , was long overdue for a change . All he had to do was to suck the mockies in softly . The mockies were wary of the new hand : he looked too simple to be quite true . Each felt he had seen the punk around before ; but none could give him a name or place him . Kippel 's players were Jews and this was a Jew  --  yet one who did n't somehow belong . They sensed a renegade . They sensed it in the first-generation Polish inflection which association with Frankie Machine had lent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tilted at the jaunty Polish angle , instead of a conservative felt pulled down a bit over the ears . Kippel 's customers wore white shirts and dark jazzbows and not one tie in that whole circle gave promise of lighting up even for a moment . " What 's the matter  --  no gamblers in the house ? " Sparrow asked with real resentment as , one by one , they dropped off from the challenge of the hidden jacks . For , like the Jewish fighters , the Jewish gamblers were counterpunchers . They could wait on the defensive forever , hoarding their strength , their cunning and their cards for the single opening as though one openingwere all that were granted a man in one lifetime . They had learned that the one blow , the one ace , the single chance had to be the decisive one . They knew that for them there would be no consolation honors and no second chance . There was the knowledge of the long-hunted : to turn swiftly , with open claws at the very moment of disaster , upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another day . When the hunted lost they lost for keeps . Therefore they had to win every day , they had to win tonight , tomorrow and forever . The long chance was the pursuer 's luxury , the short one the necessity of the pursued . The pursued had to be certain beforehand , make no mistake in timing and do it all within rules laid down long ago by the hunter . " If this was a Polak game nobody 'd drop , " Sparrow decided . P249For the Poles shoved the law of averages off the table and chased the longest possible chance down fantastic myriad ways . With three kings face up about the board and not enough in the pot to warrant a 5  --  1 risk , they took the 52  --  1 chance without hesitation and went for the case king as if it were a hope of heaven . If they did hit it the very idea of having had the brassbound nerve to play a chance that long was as exciting a reward to them as the money it had won . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they played like men who never lost a round ; though they might have been losing steadily for a month . The Jews recalled last year 's losses and forgot this hand 's winnings . The Poles played the game for its own sake , to kill the monotony of their lives . The Jews played to make the hours return to them of what other hours , in other cities , had robbed their fathers ; their lives were less boring away from the board than at it . The Pole , even when playing on borrowed money and the rent overdue , still felt , somehow , that he could afford to lose all night because he was so sure to win everything in the end . The Jew knew that the moment he felt he could afford to lose he would begin losing till the bottom of the world fell through and he himself went through the hole . It was more fun being a Polish gambler ; it was safer to be a Jewish one . Now , after he had raised the bet to a dollar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Sparrow . He had n't yet filled but had an open six and an open deuce to draw to and on the sixth card the player to his left suddenly bet into him . Sparrow raised it a dollar without faltering and the third hand dropped . The final card was down and the man who 'd taken over the driver 's seat checked . Sparrow sensed him to be hiding . With only a single left in front of him he said , " Two in the dark  --  one buck light . " He was that certain his card was there . It had to Ix , there . " Owes the pot a buck , " the dealer announced and Sparrow caught Higli Man 's eyes measuring him as if he were a badly marinated herring and shoved two singles and a silver trail of quarters into the pot . " Two and two better . " The dealer counted swiftly  --  " but not so fast as Frankie "  --  Sparrow thought loyally . Then lost courage and said , " I see . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the punk 's greedy Ilttle heart fluttered weakly . " Turn ' em over . " High Man flipped his hand : two little deucies and three little treys . He 'd caught . Sparrow revealed his three jacks wired . Beside a six , aP250deuce and a queen . All the closed card had to be was a deuce  --  but the deuces were dead  --  a trey  --  but the treys were dead  --  a queen then or the case jack  --  the dealer flipped the card for him . Nine of clubs . " That nine of clubs is the devil card every time , " somebody sympathized . " I owe you free , friend , " Sparrow assured High Man . " Be right back with the bundle  --  save my seat , Dealer . " " It 's a long night till morning , " someone surmised dryly . But Sparrow was almost to the door before the bouncer collared him . " You owe the gentmuns some money over there . " " Holy Jumped-up Jesus , " Sparrow protested with real indignation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him myself  --  it 's where I 'm goin ' now , to get it . Where the hell you think I 'm goin ' ? " " Out to steal it for all I know  --  but the gentmuns ca n't wait . " " If he ca n't wait let the house pay him off . " Sparrow faltered then and he whispered in strict confidence , " I 'm a steerer myself , friend . Us steerersgot to stick together . " " Let him go , Ju-ju , " someone said behind the bouncer . It was old man Kippel , looking as professionally tolerant as a Southern senator . Old man Kippel did n't go for rough stuff for sums under five c 's . " Just see the lad do n't sit in the dollar game no more . " " I 'll remember you all the same , sheenie , " Ju-ju told Sparrow , to le+-his boss know that his heart was in his work . But the punk had fled . pockets empty and feelings wounded savagely . " Callin ' me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  he could n't get no job except in a rag-sheenie joint . " And wondered whether that kite was still caught up there , so high on the city wires . That was how Sparrow was still feeling when he wandered back into the Tug &; Maul hoping that his credit might still somehow rate a shot and a beer . His rating had slipped badly with Antek since Old Husband had checked out . A new sign above the register apprised him that it was lower than ever today : I think you think you think you know what I 'm thinking but I 'm not thinking what I think you think I think : Credit . While in the place of the Our cow is dead legend a more forceful one expressed Owner 's current attitude toward everyone : Once a rat always a ratP251And who , standing up to be counted , can say that not once has he played the rat ? So there was n't any use reminding Owner how freely he had spent Old Husband 's Christmas bonus and then had gone right on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frankie was sitting in the bucket . Owner had a bad memory for long-spent rolls . It had n't even been a good idea to spend it with Owner , Sparrow realized regretfully now . It seemed like I was buildin ' up my credit then . But I was oney tearin ' it down , " he was forced to conclude these many months after . " All the good I done was to get Frankie saltyback at me . " While the big bass juke mocked his present poverty . " Wrap your troubles in dreamsAnd dream your troubles away . . . In the back booth , where he and Frankie had so often drunk together , Umbrella Man sat with his great unskilled hands folded gently over his bell and his head lying sidewise upon his hands , so that the bell 's rainrustedhandle made a long crease in his unshaven cheek . The bottom had pretty well fallen out of things for Umbrellas when Frankie had taken the ride to Twenty-sixth and California . He had been drunk most of the time since . His credit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Once Cousin Kvorka had had him locked up overnight to keep him from gambling and had then told him he was only out on parole . Umbrellas had believed , ever since , that if he should ever be caught gambling , at any table where anyone but Frankie Machine was dealing , he too would be sent out to Twenty-sixth and California . Now he raised his battered brow , called to some dealer of his dreams for the one card that could save his life and waited , with a dull glaze over his eyes , till it seemed to fall right in front of him . He studied the hypothetical card , turning it over and over with fingers that seemed to fee it and read with heavy lids : " Fulled up . Aces . " Then boggled his eyes about at the hypothetical players with whom he played so often of late : now one of them would have to buy him a drink . And fell forwardacross his bell as though he 'd been struck from behind with the handle of his own umbrella @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needle in a haystack . Sometimes Its even harder to find five dollars in a city of four million people , most of them millionaires . So that when Sparrow heard a familiar shuffle be-P252hind him he turned on the stool and said , " I want to talk to you , Piggy-O . " Pig , wearing his everlasting smirk with that same air of fresh prosperityhe 'd worn ever since Nifty Louie had checked out , tapped on toward the eyeless juke without hearing a word , leaving behind the same old smell of unwashed underwear . Tapped on more softly than before . Sparrow looked down . The big flat feet had been squeezed into a pair of long , narrow , two-tone jobs more fit for a race track in August than a bar in December . Nifty Louie 's very shoes : Sparrow could still see them coming down that long dark stair . " My God , " he thought with something of awe , " I do n't think he even left Louie his socks . " At the juke Pig turned his black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box by smell ; the very hairs within the nostrils seemed to quiver . And though his hands were as grimy as ever Sparrow saw that the nails had been manicured ; to go with the suit that fitted him like a hide . He lifted the cane 's begrimed tip till it touched the lowest of the box 's numbers , then moved upward , exactly like a nervous spider , in little leaps from one number to that above till it attained the top row and punched his favorite number at last. " 0 tidings of comfort and joy , Comfort and joy . . . Sparrow waited till the juke had finished , then moved swiftly up to Pig 's ear : " Borrow me a dirty sawbuck , Piggy-O . " Pig looked down at his hand , lying flat on the bar , just as though he could see the soot imbedded in the wrinkles there . Slowly it began to crawl with desires all its own , one manicured finger at a time , one inch at a time , to rest till the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a miniature burlesque , till the bar 's very edge was reached , and returned to the exact spot from which they 'd begun that neurotic carnival . " You made me dance to your music , brother  --  now you dance to mine , " he told the punk at last . " I was just a guilty culprit them days , Piggy-O . Times is different now . I 'm not takin ' no more gas off the dealer . Account of him I got the gate by Schwiefka . Hinges ' n all . What you think of a buddy who 'll turn on a fellow like that ? " Pig looked over Sparrow 's shoulder with a certain pursued look.  | " Schwiefka 's is a good place to hang away from these days anyhow , " he confided in Sparrow . " You do n't look like you need to shag coffee ' n cigarettes for him no more . " Sparrow admired Pig 's new look . " You look like you 're doin ' awright , Piggy-O . " " Even a blind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boasted a bit . Louie must have left an opening big enough to shove a suitcase full of little brown drugstore bottles through , Sparrow decided to himself . " Blind guys can hear real good sometimes too , " he ventured , studying Pig 's fat face . And saw the faintest sort of flattered smile stray a momentover those bloodless lips . " The dealer off you ? " Pig asked at last . " Like a filthy shirt , " Sparrow assured him . " He makes me feel like a heel . Not even a heavy heel . Just a light heel . " " Why do n't you try steerin ' by Kippers , Steerer ? " " By Kippers ? " Sparrow felt shocked at the idea . " Not for me , Piggy-O . That 's the sheenie cheaters ' joint . I 'll go on the legit before I go to work for sheenie cheaters . " " A guy workin ' for me gets his dough in advance  --  he ca n't get cheated that way , can he ? " Sparrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Could n't you just borrow me a sawbuck ? It ai n't my line of work , what you got in mind . " " It 's up to you , Steerer , " Pig told him coldly and turned to go . Sparrowcaught the cane with real despair . " I got no place to sleep tonight , Piggy . " And sensed , even as he held the cane and would not let it go , that Pig had come into the Tug &; Maul looking for him . That he 'd simply let the talk run on until it had been Sparrow doing the seeking . He should never have talked that hard about Frankie . " It 's two bucks a delivery , Steerer . All I can afford . " Then hearing no reply other than that despairing grasp on his cane , brought out a tiny package , wrapped by cleaner hands , out of an unclean vest . " I got friends who get sick . It 's a good deed , deliverin ' medicine to sick people . " " Bringing tidings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sparrow needed a shot and a beer . But Pig let him sit feeling that his tongue was drying onto the roof of his mouth .   " This one needs it real bad , and a hot little piece , I heard  --  if she wants to show you she 's grateful it 's awright  --  but get the sawbuck first  --  bring it back ' n you get the deuce for delivery  --  Antek 'll break the ten for me awright , he gives a guy a square count ' n do n't ask questions neither . Yeh , ' n I 'll buy you a double shot too . You stick with me you 'll have your own sawbuck by twelve o'clock . " " Is it real far , Piggy-O ? " It felt very far indeed . And yet  --  how unlucky could one punk get in just one night ? He 'd had all the bad luck there was already and enough left over for a month to come . The image of the kite caught on the wires returned . " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the corner for a guy with eyes . Kosciusko Hotel . I 'll wait in the back boot ' . " And the little drugstore package lay on the scarred bar between them . Pig moved it with the cane 's curved handle toward Sparrow . If that Frankie was n't so stubborn , it was all that Frankie 's fault . As it moved toward him Sparrow saw , irrelevantly , that for some reason Pig had wrapped the cane 's handle in tinfoil . When Frankie found out how mean he 'd been he 'd be real sorry . The cane 's bright silver luster had been stained , by those same hot blind hands , into a gutter-colored gray . " The dealer was laughin ' in here today , " Pig reminisced , " he was tellin ' Owner how you could n't pick up a dime no more ' cause you lost his backin ' . He said it was gon na get pretty rough for you when the Jailer moved in by Violet . He said --  " " Do n't tell me what nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the dirty bottle . " " T'ree-fifteen B , " Blind Pig directed . " Go around the side door ' n use the elevator . " Sparrow yanked the baseball cap down over his eyes  --  it would be just his hundred-to-one luck to have Cousin Kvorka pick him up on general principles at the corner . But at the corner there was only the amputee who sold papers there , his cap wrapped in the Daily News and folded into his crutch 's handle to rest his armpit while he whooped , " Graziano suspended ! " Somebody was always suspending somebody , the punk reflected moodily . And the way the arc lamp swung one moment over newsstand and car line and curb gave a lilt of fear to his heart . The lights were against him crossing Ashland but he wove in and out till he gained the opposite curb , keeping close to the store windowsP255down to Cortez , and turned down a gangway where half-soled poverty has so long sought hotel side doors that Sparrow could feel , beneath his own thin uppers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He rememberedit was the hotel at which he had first registered with Violet as man and wife and no more luggage between them than that carried by the pigeons drowsing in the eaves . Now the first full moon of December burned with a steady yellow fury , the way a night light once had burned above the dealer 's head . A pang of regret caught the punk unaware : that such nights could not come again . Pausing to light a cigarette , the pang clung to his heart like the mist about the bulb at the gangway 's end . " I must be cheatin ' on somebody , " he told himself uneasily , " I got that guilty-culprit feelin ' , like somethin'sgoin ' to happen . " As he stepped inside the side door of the bright little lobby the elevatorstarter beckoned to him . Sparrow did n't name the floor : he simply stood eying that starter mail the cage paused on the third level and the fellow slammed the door open with confidence that it was the third floor the shabby little man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a voice . " Go back , Solly . Go back or you 'll never get back . " But there was no place to go but out of the cage and into the long red-carpeted lobby . IIe walked slowly , pretending to look for a certain door but only listening for the shutting of the cage behind him so that he could get rid of the bottle in his pocket anywhere at all . When he turned to see what was keeping the cage on the third-floor level that fishy-eyed starterminted to 315B and called out in a soft-clothes man 's command : Knock ! " In a kind of paralysis , afraid to knock and afraid not to , fearing the ones who 'd open the door when he did and fearing fast footsteps down the carpet behind him and the flash of a badge , he raised his ragged little claws to the indifferent wood . And never knocked at all . The door opened to him . Frankie . With a line of sweat under his hair line and looking so sick Sparrow could only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comin ' to . " Frankie yanked him inside , slammed the door , took the bottle out of the punk 's pocket and unwrapped it with fumbling fingers while Sparrow protestedhis innocence . " Honest to Jesus , Frankie , I did n't know it was fer you ' n it begun to feel like a dirty frame ' n I got scared . "  | " You always get scared too soon . You got the bull horrors . Hand me the hypo , I 'm hitchin ' up the reindeers . " The needle lay in a cigar box above the radiator and Sparrow brought it over box and all as if fearing to touch the needle itself . Frankie was swinging his arm to get the blood moving , but his legs went weak and he had to sit on the bed 's very edge . His fingers faltered on his sleeve and then pointed . " Roll it up , Solly . I 'm in a deadly spin . " Sparrow rolled the sleeve neatly and backed off . He wanted to go now . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frankie smelled green . And he did n't want to see Frankie using that dirty stuff . " I do n't know if I can make it by myself , " Frankie pleaded . " Do n't chill on me . Stick with me just this one time . " But somehow had still enough toughness left to grin weakly at the fright in Sparrow 's eyes . " You look as sick I feel , " he teased Sparrow . " Maybe you need a charge yourself . There 's enough for us both  --  we 'll jump together . " " I ai n't jumpin ' nowheres but home , Frankie , " Sparrow told him just as if he had one . Frankie sucked the air out of the medicine dropper , then held a match to the morphine in the tiny glass tube . But his hand shook so that he could n't steady the flame . " Melt it , " he pleaded with the punk , " melt me God 's medicine , " and lay back with the one bared arm upflung and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His whole broad forehead glistened whitely with sweat and the throat so stretched with suffering that it shone bloodlessly . A dead man 's throat . When the cap had melted Sparrow asked , " What do I do now , Frankie ? " Frankie put a hand to his mouth , coughed the little dry addict 's cough and pointed to his arm . " Tie it . " Sparrow took the tie off the bedpost and bound it about the naked biceps . " Tighter , " Frankie begged . " Tight as you can pull it . " When it was tight as a vise Sparrow took the tie 's dangling end and , involuntarily , daubed the tears out of Frankie 's eyes . " You 're sweatin ' awful hard , " he pretended . Frankie sniffled . Sweat or tears , it made no difference , all that matteredwas to make the sickness stop . " It kills me in the heart , how you are now , " Sparrow could n't keep from saying . " It just ai n't like bein ' Frankie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing of all for me to be , Solly , " Frankie told him with a strange gentleness . " I 'm gettin ' farther away from myself all the time . It 's why I have to have a charge so bad , so I can come back ' n be myself a little while again . But it 's a longer way to go every time . It keeps gettin ' harder ' n harder . It 's gettin ' so hard I ca n't hardly afford it . " He laughed thinly . " I ca n't hardly afford to be myself no more , Solly , with the way Piggy-O is peggin ' the price up on me . I got to economize ' n be just Mr. Nobody , I guess . " He looked at Sparrow curiously . " Who am I anyhow , Solly ? " He really did n't know any longer . From one day to the next , he no longer knew . For he answered himself in an oddly altered little voice , a voice Sparrow had never before heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they give the stripes to ' cause he got the golden arm . It 's all in the wrist ' n he got the touch , it 's why they had to give him the stripes . See them little red pinholes , Solly  --  it 's the new kind of stripes us sergeants are pinnin ' on the arm these days . The new way of doin ' things we got , you might call it . You know who I am ? You know who you are ? You know who anybody is any more ? " " I do n't know , Frankie . " " Tell me just one thing you do know then . " Sparrow watched closely to see whether Frankie were putting on a bit of an act , to get at something he still wanted to find out . It was hard to tell . " I 'll tell you if I know , Frankie , " he offered . " Then tell me just this  --  why do some cats swing like this ? " Solly did n't know that either . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any more than he 'd known what to make of the question . Yet F ' rankie was laughing , weakly on and on , just as if he 'd said something funny . While that naked arm looked far too white to have any gold left in its veins . " You know the heartaches , Solly , I 'll say that for you , " Frankie took breath long enough to say . " You always knew the heartaches . Why do n't you learn the good kicks too ? " Then the weak laughter began again , with something almost convulsive in it now , as though he lacked the strength to laugh but somehow felt he had to  --  till it ran into tears of such a barbed despair that Sparrow called to him like calling to IHUneone far away , " Be yourself , Frankie ! " For a second he thought he was going to have to slap him to bring him back . Frankie came back to himself , brushed the sweat off his forehead with the back of his arm and began flattering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It ai n't just knowin ' the heartaches you 're good for , Solly . You know how to do a thing , too . I 'll say that much for a kid like you . ' Cause you 're the one kid knows how to fix the old junkie when Old Junkie needs a little fix . " He shook his head like a drunk . " Whoof ! Old Junkie 's spinnin ' like never before . Hit the main stem ' n make me right . " Across the disheveled bed a new deck lay scattered . " He must of been shufflin ' a few hands to hisself just to keep in shape , " Sparrow deducedand told Frankie , " I do n't know if I can find it , Frankie , it ai n't my line of work . " But felt Frankie 's hand , cold as a surgeon 's glove , guiding his fingers . " There . Press . Slow . Now . " Frankie clenched his fist tightly to bring out the vein . Above the elbow a little inflamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OperationMcGantic , " Sparrow heard him murmur . Sparrow saw the blood spray faintly , tingeing the morphine pink  --  and pressed while his own eyes went blind . " It feels like I 'm puffin ' it right into your poor heart , " he thought . As the needle came out a slow trickle of blood followed halfway to the elbow . Frankie lay sprawled loosely with his eyes shuttered ; but with the first faint flush touching the pallor of his cheeks . As the pale morphine had been tinged by the suffering blood . " How 's my complexion ? " he asked teasingly , without opening his eyes at all . " Your complexion 's awright , Frankie . But you ca n't deal on that stuff . Remember Steady hand ' n steady eye . It 's all in the wrist ' n you got the touch ' ? Remember , Frankie ? " " It 's all above the elbow now , " Frankie answered , scratching his calf indolently . " I 'm out of the slot , " he assured Sparrow with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starting to hit , his eyes were dew-bright and the glow of health was on his cheeks . " Did n't I tell you I got a chance to start beatin ' the tubs at a hundred-fifty a week ? Krupa been askin ' around at the Musicians ' Club where can he get in touch with me , I guess some guys told him about that night at St. Wenceslaus when I got everybody goin ' like fools the way I was in the groove . I may take it , I 'll have to see what he got . " He went right into some little old tune or other , rapping his knees with his knuckles , tongue between his teeth and his neck waggling an imagined rhythm . " You got to gim me whatcha got , You got to gim me whatcha got ... "   " ' That 's the best way to do , Frankie , " Sparrow agreed earnestly . " Don  --  t let them get you cheap . " After all it 's quite a trick to lose your strength and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you could get me somethin ' to do with one of them orchester leaders , " Sparrow offered his services as innocently as he was able . " It sort of looks like I 'm in that line now anyhow . " Frankie yawned hugely . " Come here ' n scratch my back . " And while Sparrow scratched his back he turned and twisted , with an animal 's icecoldjoy . " I 've said it a hundred times , " he told Sparrow after the punk had been permitted to leave off scratching at last , " this one time and I 'll kick it for keeps . " He bent over to scratch his ankles and toes right to the nails . " And ? " Sparrow wanted to know . Frankie looked up at him from where he bent his head over his shoelessfeet . " I 'm hooked , ai n't I ? " He sat up then , making a deck of the scattered cards in complete absent-mindedness , his hands straying blindly for the cards while his eyes searched , on the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shoreless waters of the night . " I ca n't do much for you in that line , Solly , " he decided , still riffling the deck idly . " About the only thing I have open is a watcher 's job . " " A lookout , you mean , Frankie ? " It was time to start taking Frankie seriously again , he was coming down out of the clouds . " I 'd sure like steerin ' better'n what I 'm doin ' tonight . I 'd rather have a square job than what I 'm doin ' tonight . " " It 's not steerin ' exactly . It 's watchin ' . Indian-watchin ' , I think they call it . A little different but you 'll pick it up . It 's a new angle that 's just comin on . " " I 'll take anythin ' , Frankie . Me ' n Vi ' r quits . Who 'll tell me what to do ? " " Nothin ' to it , Solly . All you do is , first thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have out there ' n when you see the Indians comin ' you run right back down ' n tell the settlers . Nothin ' to it so long as you do n't fall asleep on the job . " The light broke over Sparrow as the cheap gag was driven home . " I know , " he admitted forlornly , " I listen to the radio sometimes myself . " His face was peaked with disappointment as he waited now only for Frankie to pay him off for the delivery . " It 's your chance to tell him who rolled Louie that night , " he toldP260himself  --  and let the chance pass . What was the difference what Frankie thought any more ? He rose to go . " Do n't go , " Frankie begged him . " I got to , " Sparrow realized , " I 'm gettin ' that guilty feelin ' again , like the aces ' r gon na bust down the door . " Without a warning Frankie leaned forward and slapped the punk squarely across the nose with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What the hell is gettin ' into you , Frankie ? I do n't have to take that off you . " " You got that comin ' for a long time , Solly . " " I tried to tell you once you got me wrong about Louie , Frankie . You would n't listen . I was n't the guy got his roll . If I had we would of split like always . You can believe me ' r not . " " I know who got the roll now awright . But you still had it comin ' . " " Awright  --  I ran ' n you got busted . I know I done bad then  --  but ca n't you figure I got scared just like you done the night by Schwiefka 's hall ? Ca n't you figure what another department-store rap 'd do to me , Frankie ? I could n't even get paroled . Do n't that give me the right to get scared too ? " Frankie listened with his head moving a bit from side to side , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just to use the deck again . It had felt pretty good for a minute there . " It ai n't for that neither , " he cut Sparrow short . Sparrow watched the hand on the deck . " I wo n't take another crack off you , " he told Frankie quietly . The hand drummed the deck a moment , thinking that over , then moved off the cards . " You want to know what for ? " Frankie demanded . And answered himself , " I 'll tell you what for . " Sparrow waited . He wanted to know all right . " I do n't know why you done that to me , Frankie . " " ' Cause you double-crossed me on the streetcar the time Cousin Kvork picked us up on Damen ' n Division for nothin " n Schwiefka sprung us the next day . You did n't have no two pair on that transfer . So I owe you nineteen more . " Sparrow goggled , he was really stunned . He could n't remember the game played in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trolley . " Do n't give me the goof act , " Frankie threatened him , " hearts for noses  --  ' n you losed both games . " Sparrow got it then all right . " I do n't remember what I had ' r whatP261you had , Frankie , " he answered honestly . " But if you think I 'm settin ' here while you try knockin ' my nose off you 're gon na get your own bust in a brand-new place . " His hand touched the glass ash tray on the arm of his chair . And felt hardly afraid at all . For the first time in his life he looked nt Frankie with the knowledge that it was n't himself who would have to back down . " It 's the new way of doin ' things , you might call it , " he explained . Frankie tried to grin but the grin was weak . He scattered the deck across the bed in a gesture of surrender . " Maybe you won anyhow , I do n't know , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in my head . All kinds of things go through my head these days , how they get in there there 's no tellin ' any more . It 's just the way everythin ' is , I guess  --  you know how everythin ' is , Solly ? Let me tell you hew everythin ' is . " He sounded like a man talking on and on for dread of something that will move through his brain the moment the tongue ceases its babble . " I can see how everythin ' is awright , " Sparrow assured him . " No , you ca n't see . Nobody can . Nobody knows , just junkies . Just Junkies know how everythin ' is . Sit down , Solly  --  please . " The light was fading in his eyes now , they were sinking into his head and the freshness the drug had brought to his cheeks had turned into a dull putty-gray . He said " please " like a man begging for a dime and just the way he said it left Sparrow feeling that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If it 'll do you good to talk , " he thought with the taste of dust on his tongue , " I 'll listen this one time . Because I knew you when you were the best sport I knew my whole life . What 's your story , cousin ? " he offered aloud . Frankie coughed into his palm . " It 's like this , Solly . You put it down for months ' n months , you work yourself down from monkey to zero . You beat it . You got it beat at last . " He was talking low and breathlessly , like one who fears that , if he does n't get his story told quickly it will never be told at all ; like one who believes he is the only one who knows . Really knows . " You know you got it beat . You got it beat so stiff when the fixer says , It ai n't gon na cost you a dime this time , I got some new stuff I just want to try , ' you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him the huigh . When he tells you , innocent-like , The hypo is in the top drawer over there , help yourself any time , ' just to put it in your head how easy it 'd be , you turn him down flat . Because gettin ' fixed is the one thing you 'll never need again all your life .   " Three weeks later you wake up , it 's dark out but not like night ' n it ai n't morning neither  --  it 's just Fix Time . It 's comin ' on like a wave way out there , bigger ' n bigger ' n comin ' right at you till it 's big as this hotel , it hits you ' n you 're gone . You 're so sick you 're just turnin ' around down there under that wave not carin ' who knows , your mother ' r your sister ' r your buddy ' r your wife  --  anythin ' just so 's you can stop drownin ' for a minute . " Nobody can stand gettin ' that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puke ' n you ca n't . You just heave ' n heave ' n sweat ' n heave ' n still nothin ' happens  --  then somebody turns on the faucet in the sink or the bathtub down the hall ' n just the sound of water runnin ' rolls your whole stomach over on top of itself ' n you got to puke ' r die . " Then you do n't even know no more where you 're sick  --  if you think just for one second , It 's my poor gut '  --  it starts bustin ' your brains out the back of your head just to show you . So you think it 's your head ' n it slams you a dirty one in the stones  --  it 's here ' n it 's there ' n you 're shaggin ' it in a dream , tryin ' to pin it down to some place you can feel it so you can fight it . " But it wo n't stay still ' n you ca n't get hold ' n if you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  he brushed the buffalo-colored shag of hair out of his eyes  --  " that 's all . There ai n't no will power ' to it like squares like to say . There ai n't that much will power on God 's green earth . If you had that much will power you would n't be a man , you 'd be Jesus Christ . " He began drying the sweat out of his armpits with the pillowcase . " You know what you brought me in that little bottle , Solly ? " Sparrow did n't know . Frankie knew he did n't know . He wanted to tell Sparrow so that the punk would never forget . So that everyone in the world who did n't know would know forever and always what Solly had brought him in the little brown bottle . " I knew , Frankie , " Solly admitted . " I knew what was in the dirty bottle awright . I guessed when Pig asked me --  " " You did n't know a thing . You did n't have no idea at all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . You think you know everything . " Sparrow wanted to go now , he could scarcely sit still for restlessness . And yet it was so hard , it was just too damned hard , to leave Frankie talking to himself all alone up here like this . " What was in it , Frankie ? " he humored the man on the bed while watching him hopefully for signs of sleepiness . He could get Frankie 's shoes off if he 'd just drowse a bit , then turn off the light and by morning they 'd both feel better . P263But Frankie did n't look sleepy at all . A smile both benign and wan wandered across his lips and a look of childlike wisdom entered his eyes . " I 'll tell you what was in the bottle , Solly . " He looked demure , he looked so sly , his eyes sought the floor in a womanish sort of coyness completely strange to Sparrow . " A itty-bittsy little old monkey , Solly , that 's what you brought me in the bottle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . You know where my itsy-monkey is now , Solly ? " These changes in mood , so swift and strange in one always so slow in all moods , brought a cold tug of fear to Sparrow 's heart . " I guess he was just too little for me to see then , " he humored Frankie again . " It 's just what I thought you 'd say "  --  Frankie looked triumphantcause he ai n't little at all no more . He 's growed up into a real great big feller just since you been settin ' there , Solly . He weighs thirty-five pounds ' n he 's settin ' right here on my back usin ' all his weight ' cause he knows I got to carry him around wherever I go so 's I do n't get lonesomefor nobody no more . Can you see him , Solly ? " " Why do n't you try to sleep awhile , Frankie ? " But Frankie was wound up like a clock and there was nothing to do but listen to him till he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pounds , that 's when I cut him down a little . Once I cut him down to zero , I starved the poor little feller to death . They buried him out at Twenty-sixth ' n Cal . ' N that 's n funny thing right there . " " It do n't seem so funny to me , Frankie . " " What I mean is so funny is when he come back to me last week he weighed forty-four pounds  --  where 'd he put on all that weight , Solly ? " " It must of been another monkey , Frankie . " " Can you see him yet , Solly ? " " I think I can see him a little now , Frankie . " Frankie grew cunning . " Want to take him a little walk yourself , Solly ? There 's still two quarter grains in the bottle  --  you fixed me so I 'll fix you ' n then we 'll be buddies again like we used , helpin ' each other out ' n Iuistlin ' some mark so fast he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n then we get together afters in the back booth by Antek ' n nobody knows what we 're laughin ' about , just you ' n me , the good old buddies again ' cause bygones is bygones . What you say , Solly ? A free pop on me ? JustP264to see what it really feels like ? Then you 'll know , you 'll be more broadmindedlike . " " I got enough worries without that , Frankie . " " That 's just the point , buddy . " His voice began drifting somewhere the other side of the room , the other side of the curtained window , the other side of the street and the other side of the world . " There 's so many little worries floatin ' around ' n floatin ' around , why not roll ' em all up into one big worry ? Just like goin ' by the loan shark ' n gettin ' enough to pay off all the little debts with one big one ? That 's where I 'm bein ' smarter than you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's what you ought to do too so 's we can be buddies again : roll ' em all up into one big one like me , Solly . " " I do n't have that many , Frankie . " Frankie laughed derisively , with a sort of loose contempt for himself and Sparrow and everyone . The only man Sparrow had ever heard laugh like that had been Louie Fomorowski . " You got more worries than you think , punk , " Frankie told him . " You got more worries than Dick Tracy . Compared to you I 'm little Orphan Annie . ' Cause my little worries ' r almost over but yours ' r just beginnin ' . " His voice returned from the other side of the world to stir the curtain a moment and came right up to Sparrow . " Why you think Pig sent you ? " Frankie pressed both hands to his temples as if trying to hold his mind onto a single big idea . " Get out of here , punk . I had it figured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been tryin ' to hold you to see if I was right . Now I do n't care if I 'm wrong ' r right no more --  " Sparrow did n't figure it  --  he only felt it . He was at the door and the knob was in his hand  --  it was turned for him from the other side and he had to step back to keep from getting banged by the door , they came in that fast , and he had n't even heard a house key in the lock . Bednar behind Kvorka . Both in citizen dress and their hats on their heads . With nothing in their hands . Bednar put his back to the door . " Get the hypo , Sergeant , " he told Kvorka . " Now you know why Pig sent you ? " Frankie taunted everyone . " This time you 're comin ' with me , punk . " " ' N we hope you 'll stay longer this time than the last , " Bednar assuredSparrow with one hand in the punk 's narrow belt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the bedclothes . " Holy Mother , look at that cop go , " he laughed shrilly .   " They still payin ' sixteen bucks for turnin ' in a hypo , Cousin ? Make the cap split it with you  --  it 's in the cigar box on the radiator , right there under your nose , it ai n't even dry yet . " " On your feet , Dealer , " Bednar scolded him . " We 're takin ' a little ride . " Some poolroom sharpie lounging in the lobby came to a sitting positionwhen he spotted two hustlers being pulled in by a couple sof tclothesdicks and looked like he wanted to help get them to the station . But Bednar guided his little caravan unobtrusively out the side entrance and into the panel wagon waiting in the alley and wheeled away without a witness . It was n't the sort of pinch to which Bednar wanted a witness . As the wagon wheeled around the corner newsstand Sparrow heard the amputee , still pushing his papers there , call into him confidentially : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And all the way to the station listened to Frankie , still jabbering away , catching at all sorts of ragtags as if the stuff had given him some kind of delayed kick or other . Ile was going to beat the tubs with a big-time band , he was on his way now to the LaSalle Street Station to catch " the fastest flier they got there , I ride it lots of times , they call it the Twentieth-Century Note , somethin " r other . " Then he had just bought out Schwiefka and was adding four tables and a line direct from the track  --  " Now 's your chance to talk payoff , " he told Bednar and when Cousin Kvorka urged him , " Take it easy , Dealer , we 're still for you , " he answered Cousin quickly : " Ilow 'd you like to transfer up to Evanston , Cousin ? Just say the word . " " He was buying a new Nash , he was getting divorced , he was sending Sophie to " Myer brothers , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dough I got outstandin ' starts comin ' in . " " Outstandin ' is right , " Sparrow put in . " Standin ' out in the alley , you mean . " " Yeh , " Frankie agreed strangely , " ' n then I wonder why I feel so cold the next day . " Whatever he meant by that , his tongue had ceased to rattle . The rest of the way to the station he diverted himself simply by rapping the bench between his knees with his knuckles and humming idly . " I 'm a ding-dong daddy from Duma'N you ought a see me do my stuff --  "
