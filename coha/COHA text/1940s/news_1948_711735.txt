" A Wall Street Journal survey of 17 cities confirms that sonic lay-offs are developing in most areas . The majority of these towns are absorbing manpower in one industry about as fast as it becomes surplus in another . But this " good " national average is rather icy comfort in parts of the country where some real unemployment nas developed . Oregon 's state unemployment compensation commission now reports more than 45,000 at e jobless , compared with 21,000 two months ago . Silas Geiser , administrator , says .

At this time a year ago there were 1,705 job openings , two years ago . 9.707 . Only 21 openings were listed by lumber and logging firms this month , while two years ago there were 2,028 on file .

There have been lay-offs in various industries  --  tool and die making . foundries , electrical appliances , truck manufacturing . stove making . Where both employment and unemployment rise there has , of course , been an increase in what manpower authorities refer to as the " labor force .

Cle  --  elantl'e Contradiction This mixture of high employment and a worried quest for jobs is demonstrated also in Cleveland . Estimated employment in greater Cleveland on December 1 was 586,000 . Ij - 1,000 from October 1 and up 2.000 from December 1 . 1947 . And a state survey of 173 manufacturing firms indicates they 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers , more than enough to offset employment losses of about 100 in non-mantitacluring enterprises Yet union officers say they 're feeling the softening of employment as lay-offs occur in appliance , machine tool and other industries .

This card index has increased about 1007 in the last six months and now st.s entries number more than 1,500 men  --  skilled workers . And Mr. de More emphasizes that most recent lay-offs have hit harder at unskilled workers , who do n't show on his file . Pittsburgh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steel companies are doing scene hiring . Unemploy- ment is lower than in the fall . But demand for labor has decreased sharply in the past few weeks , according to the state employment service . New job orders are slow coming in and job openings on hand are at a low ebb . Laborers , for instance , were in great demand until recently . " Then , suddenly , the need for laborers was reduced to turnover replacements only ? ' The service considers this situation temporary . Atlanta has achieved , a record employment of 242,000 in its metropolitan area , but there is a surplus now of truck drivers , painters and unskilled laborers . Some decline is expected in metal fabricating , machinery and appliance industries . In Georgia as a whole there has been some cut in textile and hosierymill employment .

Weyier , veteran secretary-treasurer of the A.F.L. Kentucky Federation of L.abor , representing about 100.000 members : " Building trades are experiencing considerable unemployment at . the present time in the Louisville area . In addition . I find that factory employment is being reduced and overtime is being cut out entirely in numerous cases . We know that on every round of wags increases we have taken a whipping . Prices run up faster than the wage increases or takehome pay . We must secure a fourth round with the hope the next Congress will stabilize prices so a fifth round will not be necessary .

Detioff , secretary of the machinists union , said : " Unemployment now is the worst I 've seen in nine .. ? pars . Metal work in this area is shot to pieces . He gave his own personal opinion that " most of the men will go easy , with people looking m at the door for their jobs . I do n't think they 're going to kick the boss in the face . Of course , there will be demands for improved working conditions and more paid holidays . " Spec , ot to Tits I.V.Lt ... STKEsr Jouss.i .
