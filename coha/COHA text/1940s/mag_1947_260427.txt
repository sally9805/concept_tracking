The Indonesian mess was almost providential in its timing . Joyfully , the Security Council dropped the Greek situation to cope with a situation cut more to the U.N . size . With unprecedented speed the Council voted ( 8-0 ) a stern resolution : the Council " calls upon " The Netherlands and the Indonesian Republic " to cease hostilities forthwith . " It further called upon the combatants to settle their disputes by arbitration . <P> Such swift action was something new in U.N . Newest and strangest was the line-up on the vote . The U.S. and Russia voted " yes " together . Britain , France and Belgium abstained . <P> The discussion was coolly legalistic , for there was some question whether U.N . had any right to interfere in the Indonesian dispute . Britain , France and Belgium , all colonial powers , had listened sympathetically to The Netherlands ' Eelco van Kleffens : he argued that the Indonesian trouble was a domestic quarrel in the Dutch household , that the Indonesian Republic will not be an independent government until Jan. 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no business to butt in . <P> Russia wanted to order the Dutch to withdraw immediately from all territory seized in the current hostilities . For his proposal Gromyko rallied only one other vote : predictable Poland 's . So Gromyko strung along with the milder U.S. view . <P> The U.S. , too , had doubts about U.N . interference . But on the side , Washington had tendered its " good offices " to bring the Dutch and Indonesians together . The Dutch promptly accepted . The dispute might still be settled before U.N . had to decide on drastic action . <P> Meanwhile , action in the Indies on the U.N . demand was as swift as at Lake Success . Although Acting Governor General Hubertus van Mook denied that U.N . had any right to intervene , he promised to halt Dutch troops . <P> Republican leaders also agreed on a cease-fire order . Indirectly , they turned down the U.S. " good offices . " They said they would accept arbitration by " several countries " under U.N . supervision . <P> Before the cease-fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of most of the Indies . Last week , with an amphibious stroke , they chopped big Sumatra in two , seized oilfields and rich rubber and coffee plantations . Republicans still held south central Java . With all major Javanese ports in Dutch hands it was an isolated stronghold .
