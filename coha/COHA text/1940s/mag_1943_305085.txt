For flavors of sweat , the human body is a regular soda fountain-the sweat of the brow is strong in uric acid , the sweat of the hands is strong in chloride ( salt ) , the sweat of the thigh is strong in lactic acid . These pungent facts are disclosed in a report by Drs . Olaf Mickelson and Ancel Keys of the University of Minnesota in the Journal of Biological Chemistry . <P> The chief purpose of their research was to find out whether enough vitamins are lost in sweat to warrant feeding U.S. soldiers in the tropics extra vitamins . The soldiers tested were all healthy young men who were set to work on treadmills in warm rooms . Sweat from the arm was collected by dripping into a bottle . Sweat from other parts was collected on clean gauze or by scraping with a beaker . For a sample of sweat from the whole body , the subject wore long , heavy underwear , then , after he got hot , was stood in a basin , had his underwear peeled off , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : few vitamins are lost in sweat , despite its variety . The only vitamin lost in any quantity is nicotinic acid , the antipellagra factor .
