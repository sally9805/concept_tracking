txt Landlords won two unexpected decisions yesterday on the rent front . The first was a long awaited action by the Cook county rent advisory board setting June- 1 as the opening date for public hearings on whether Cook county landlords are entitled to a rent increase . The second was a decision by Federal Judge William J. Campbell that he had no jurisdiction over tenant-landlord treble damage suits where the amount asked is less than $3,000 . Campbell 's action applied particularly to nine cases , but will affeet several hundred similar cases pending before him and other federal judges . He based his action on a decision ' by the United States Court of Appeals in Philadelphia April 1 . Status Of Suits Confused To tenants ' attorneys it raised the problems , first , of where they should file such suits ; and second , whether they still could sue in any court now that the statute of limitations had expired . In this type of suit it is one year , and most of the suits pending are at least a year old . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been burning for six months and especially since the new rent law was passed guaranteeing landlords a : reasonable return on their investment . The board voted instead to conduct a survey first and this job began two months ago under a committee headed by Charles . A. Wayman Jr . Landlords , on the board and off it , accused the board of stalling . Yesterdays &; action was on a motion by Wayman . He said that , within two or three weeks , his committee will have digested reports from more than 5,000 landlords giving costs and other figures pertinent to the adequacy of their rents . He said 4,467 reports had been found acceptable . Name Panel For Hearing On the suggestion of Chairman Marion G. Kudlick , Wayman 's mot ion was changed so as to provide that the hearings be held before a five man panel headed by Alfred R. Quirk , Chicago chairman of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen . Quirk is a public interest member of the board . Other members of the panel ate Wayman and Walter J. Swanwick , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Chicago Real Estate board , for the landlords , and Meyer J. Myer , advisor to the North Side Tenants ' league , for the tenants . Kudlick asked this panel to report to a special meeting May 10 on how best to limit or regulate the persons appearing to testify before the hearing , which , under law , must be completed in 30 days . Some 50 landlords who thronged the small meeting room went into an uproar when Michael Mann , regional director of the CIO , introduced a successful resolution which , in effect , censured Henry Spaulding , a landlord board member , for supporting in a public statement the so-called landlords ' tax strike . spanlding Defends Stand " I make no apologies and I take no retroactive position , " Spaulding fired back . " It is not un-American for landlords to fight back when they are wronged . " Spectators cheered and Kudlick attempted to drop the matter , but Myer quickly seconded Mann 's motion . Kudlick then remarked that such a resolution might do more harm than good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he observed . " Let 's have another , " shouted a spectator . But the motion car ried . Finally , Kudlick appointed a ' three man committee to study the removal of controls from large apartments occupied alotle by widows or other single tenants .
