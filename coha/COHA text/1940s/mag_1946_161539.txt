One hundred and one years ago , as the U.S. approached the Mexican War of 1846 , a Democratic editor found a defiant and memorable phrase : " Manifest Destiny . " The phrase fitted the temper of the times , and salved the country 's conscience : the U.S. was not really hijacking California from Mexico . It was destiny . <P> Destiny went west . It gathered in Alaska by peaceful purchase , and Hawaii by annexation . But the real diamond of the Pacific , the Philippine Archipelago , was not for sale . It belonged to Spain , a backward oppressor . With a deep breath and a fierce face , Manifest Destiny hitched up its pants and went to war-for " Cuba libre " and a free Philippines . <P> This week , after a disappointing , 48-year adventure in tempered colonialism 6,965 miles from home , Destiny vacated its western terminus . The U.S. was the first great power in its right mind which had ever kept a promise to free a colony . But the power was happy to do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promise of freedom had been freely and publicly made-and the U.S. had always intended to keep it . There were also economic reasons . The " illimitable " China market , to which the Philippines were to be the " open door , " had fizzled . In 1920 , the best year of the China trade , it totaled less than $150 million-about two-thirds of Macy 's 1945 sales . Philippine trade had climbed to sixth in the U.S. books , but duty-free Philippine products , such as sugar , had duplicated U.S. products to their hurt . <P> Spiritually , the U.S. seemed to have added little but jazz , a love of fast cars , slang and zoot suits upon the Spanish , Malayan , Chinese , Mohammedan and native cultures already oppressing the passive and indolent Filipinos . Politically , Destiny had been more successful . The Philippine Government was a textbook democracy . <P> In its practical works , the U.S. had shone . Before the war , the Philippines had over 3,500 miles of first-class roads , a modern educational program , and the largest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the best in the Orient : in 35 years , cholera , smallpox and bubonic plague had been wiped out ; the population had increased from seven to 16 million , and the average height of the " tao " ( John Doe ) from 4 ft. 11 in. to 5 ft. 4 in . <P> These entries in the ledger gave the U.S. a warm sense of benevolence as it closed the books on July 4 , 1946 . <P> Renunciation . Europe and Asia , more interested than ever in what the U.S. was up to , would watch the renunciation ceremonies in Manila with sidelong intensity . In a temporary grandstand just outside the old , grey Intramuros , in a welter of tropic steam and emotion , there would be excitement which many a straw-hatted Filipino could feel to his heels .
