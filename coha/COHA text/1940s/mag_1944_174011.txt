Nothing that Joseph Stalin said on Red Square last week made such a stir as was caused in Tokyo by his remark that Japan is " an aggressor nation . " Said the official Japanese Domei agency : The Japanese people were " surprised and offended . " It added : " The Soviet Nation is a realistic country , so in all probability her foreign policy vis -- vis her neighbor is not wholly immutable . . . . Consequently , it is the firm belief of the Japanese general public that Japan must also adopt a realistic policy that will conform with any new situation created by the Russians . " What Japan feared was that Russia would sooner or later make war on her . <P> There was other disturbing Russian news for Japan . Paper-short Moscow had allowed 700 pages for a novel by Alexander Stepanov called Port Arthur . Not only Japanese eyebrows might be raised by the book 's description of Port Arthur ( which is in Manchuria , and hence claimed by China ) as a leading Russian port on the Pacific . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
