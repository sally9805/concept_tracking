Longer than any ruddy Briton likes to talk about , there has been no authentic Scotch whiskey on sale in Britain ; practically all bottled stock was shipped to the U.S. in exchange for war material . Last week a news item parched British tongues more than ever . <P> Liberal Lord Rosebery , Regional Commissioner for Scotland , announced that some 17,000,000 gallons of aging Scotch whiskey have now been buried in " abandoned caves and other remote and inaccessible places . " Lord Rosebery , who has a tasteful appreciation for good art , good horses and good whiskey , ruefully added : " A single enemy plane . . . with no idea of specific target , dropped a single bomb which fell plumb on . . . 70,000 gallons . That shows what we 're up against . "
