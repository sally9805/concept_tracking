txt Within a period of less than a week President Truman will address three messages to the incoming Eightyfirst Congress , repeating for the most part requests for legislation that the outgoing Eightieth Congress failed to heed . The President 's program will be outlined in his State of the Union Message , which he will deliver in person before a joint session of the House and Senate Wednesday ; the economic report , to be submitted Friday , and the budget message for fiscal 1950 , due the following Monday . These messages will be the first by Mr. Truman as a President elected in his own right . They will go to a Congress back in control of the Democratic party after two years of Republican rule . To a large degree the President will be asking the Democratic majority to act on the platform and campaign pledges which carried the party to smashing victory last fall . Repeal of the Taft-Hartley Act , Federal aid to education , a national health program , a long-range farm program , extension of Social Security coverage ; inauguration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights are among the certainties in the program to be put forward by the President . They ' are the bulwark of what many have called the Truman Deal . Among the uncertainties are the amount of the budget , which is generally expected to be higher and , in the view of some , may reach a peacetime peak of $43 , - 000,000,000 , and the tax program to support this spending : Uncertain also are whether the President will ask controls to curb inflation and what he will ask in foreign aid to go to ' the Far East , notably China . The State of the Union message will give a first clue on all of these subjects , both domestic and foreign , for the President himself has said that this document will " cover the waterfront . " Informed sources say that Mr. Truman may be able to indicate a budget for fiscal 1950 , ending June 30 , more nearly in balance than he had anticipated In August . At that time he estimated a deficit of $1,500,000,000 and , while spending will exceed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward to the fiscal year 1950 , the President must consider the increasing cost of defense measures , here and abroad , which will drive up the budget figure . The budget total , it is said , would be about two billions higher were it not for a budget innovation . Tax refunds will not be counted as expenditures , nor will the corresponding amount of tax collections be counted as revenue . During the recent Presidential campaign the indications were that , if additional revenue was needed to balance the budget , it would be provided by reimposition of the excess profits tax , scaled down from wartime levels . The President had asked for such a levy twice during the year . But in the late fall prices leveled off somewhat and some Presidential advisers have argued that resort to the excess profits tax at this time might not be economically healthy . With an eye to keep , ing production high , new enter1 prise capital free , many have recommended an increased corpora , tion tax as preferable . With the price drop which came late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House reportedly is divided on whether Mr. Truman should renew in full the requests he made last year for standby controls . It is believed that he will ask power to allocate steel and other scarce industrial materials to back up voluntary rationing , should that fail ; extension of rent control , with tighter provisions for enforcement ; stronger authority to regulate bank credit strengthened anti-monopoly laws and renewed controls over exports , imports and installment buying . In calling for the repeal . of the Taft-Hartley Act , the President is expected to ' recommend that it be replaced with a labor law framed largely around the old Wagner Act , but containing some of the proposals he made a year ago . He called then for a substitute that would provide regulation of jurisdictional - disputes , a ban on secondary boycotts and means to control " national emergency " strikes . Other proposals probably will be increase in the minimum wage from 40 to 75 cents and Social Security coverage for 20,000,000 additional persons , including farm ; domestic and government employes . The Truman long-range farm program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contain provision for storage fcilities to make it possifile  --  for the farmer to get the full benefit of the support program . Failure of the Republican-controlled Eightieth Congress to supply emergency storage facilities weighed heavily against the party in the national election . Ratification of the international wheat agreement and repeal of Federal oleomargarine taxes also are likely proposals . Normal extension of the European Recovery Program , including a $4,500,000,000 appropriation for the coming fiscal year and $1,125 , - 000,000 for the three months from April 1 to June 30 , also is an expected ' recommendation . Military lend-lease to Western Europe is a question which may await further development . Extension of the Reciprocal Trade Agreements . Act for three years and ratification of the St. Lawrence Seaway and ' power treaty are other likely international proposals . Because of the large number of southerners in the Democratic majorities in the Congress much interest will attach to the manner in Ohich the President renews his request for civil rights legislation . When originally presented Feb. 2 it was a detailed ten-point program . Limitations of time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only thirty minutes , will prevent such detail .
