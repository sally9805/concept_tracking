Three years ago , Lucy Mouledous ( pronounced Molly-do ) all but dragged her two young sons on to a tennis court , to have someone to practice with . She is a four-time New Orleans women 's champion . Son Alfred Jr . would have none of it , hustled back to his six-hours-a-day piano practicing , and became at 16 the youngest musician ever to solo with the New Orleans Symphony . But son Dick liked the game , soon learned all his mother 's tricks , and a few besides . <P> Last week , 15-year-old Dick and his mother ( who is 34 ) wished each other luck , then began play in the New Orleans Mid-Winter Open Tournament . Dick won the men 's singles , paired to win the men 's doubles , teamed with his mother to cop the mixed doubles . Lucy won the women 's singles ( there was no women 's doubles ) . <P> The Mouledous grand slam was no surprise to the experts . Dick , a confident but not cocky youngster , began to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in straight sets , won the National Outdoor Boys ' Singles championship without trouble . Besides a powerful forehand , he has an exceptional change of pace , a tantalizing drop shot . A big fellow for his age , Dick Mouledous ( whose father runs a butcher shop ) is over 6 ft. , weighs 160 lb . <P> As one of the brightest young postwar net stars the U.S. has developed , Mouledous is a good bet to shine in future Davis Cup competition , unless Hollywood gets there first . Last week , a talent scout who saw Dick 's picture in a New Orleans paper signed him up for 20th Century-Fox . Said the scout : " He 's got a face that will appeal to women . "
