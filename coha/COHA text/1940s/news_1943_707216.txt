txt Sherbet Also Costs Money THE TIMES announced that Dr. Stebbins , Health Commissioner , cautions the public to be alert to the fact that sherbet , instead of ice cream , may be served to them by retailers . He is quite right , of course , but if he wants to be fair to the small shopkeepers he should not leave the inference , which his quoted remarks certainly do , that the shopkeeper gains financially by substituting sherbet for ice cream . A little investigation on his part would show him that the dealer pays exactly as much for sherbet as for ice cream . The retail dealer does n't want to give the public sherbet instead of ice cream When he ca n't get anything else , which is so often true , he has to sell the former . Certainly the dealer should inform his customers , but he should not be laid open to the charge that he is making money by the substitution . E. 0 . FIELD .
