A Walk in the Sun ( Lewis Milestone-20th Century-Fox ) is an accurate transposition to the screen of Harry Brown 's slight , highly polished war novel . The story of an all but leaderless platoon of U.S. infantrymen , marching the few miles from an Italian beachhead to their objective , a Nazi-infested farmhouse , has fine dramatic unity and enough signs of life to hold the eye . The dialogue is 200-proof literary corn ; the background music , a synthetic folk-song sung like a lullaby , is deplorable . But the story 's lack of pretension and a number of good unactorish performances make A Walk in the Sun one of the best in the current spate of war films . <P> All the characters in A Walk are almost too easy to identify : each personality wears a simple , colorful , unmistakable tag . Rivera is always bumming a cigarette ; Windy is composing an unwritten letter to his sister ; Archimbeau is forever grumbling about the coming Battle of Tibet ; two other privates are always discussing Satevepost art . This rigid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single-faceted . The conversations never get beyond the starting line and the story of the marching men becomes an interlocking series of running gags . <P> Dana Andrews , as a sergeant who finds himself in command of the platoon , is notable for a quiet , forceful performance . In spite of the artiness of its presentation , the film has excitement and some feeling of reality . But for all its brave effort , A Walk never succeeds in being much more than a chamber-music arrangement of All Quiet on the Western Front . <P> <P> Snafu ( Columbia ) is a comedy about a boy who lied to the recruiting office to get into the Army and then became a problem-veteran at the age of 15 . His return from the wars throws his family into a farcical uproar . Snafu may well be the first in a long line of comedies about returning soldiers . The fact that this film 's hero is extraordinarily young makes most of the humor fresh and innocent , and the occasional pathos effective . Actor Conrad Janis , a 17-year-old screen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late Robert Benchley is affable as the harassed father . <P> Ronnie returns from the South Pacific with a bagful of gruesome trophies , a disenchanted view of marriage and highly developed skill at judo . When a jovial Legionnaire slaps him on the back , Ronnie , with an automatic judo reflex , tosses him over one shoulder . When a plane passes over the house during a scene of young love , Ronnie grabs his girl and ducks for shelter . The film finally degenerates into a routine addition to , the Henry Aldrich plot . <P> Originally a stage play , Snafu tends to be cramped and stagey in its action . Most of the difficulties take place inside Ronnie 's house , in a typical stage living room with a French door back center , leading to a patio and thence to oblivion . One good stage trick is kept : a hypochondriac grandmother , never seen by the audience , raps fiercely on the floor of her bedroom whenever she wants attention . <P> San Antonio ( Warner ) is a cow-country version of Robin Hood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
