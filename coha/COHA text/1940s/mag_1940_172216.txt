For centuries fishermen on little ( one square mile ) Lake Nemi , 20 miles from Rome in the Alban Hills , reported mysterious fouling of their nets and shadowy hulks beneath the blue-grey water on clear days , told tall tales of two legendary floating palaces once belonging to monstrous Emperor Caligula , now rotting in the mud . In 1446 curious Cardinal Prospero Colonna made the first attempt to raise the pleasure barges , succeeded only in irreparably damaging their superstructures with the iron grappling hooks . <P> Ninety years later a military engineer in a primitive diving apparatus descended to the lake floor , described what he had seen in glowing terms : " There were pegs veined so darkly they seemed of ebony ... a pavement of bricks three palms each way , red as carmine , and also enameling . . . . " Still other grapplings yielded slabs of terra cotta , mosaics and porphyry , but the vessels themselves remained stuck in the ooze . In 1928 Mussolini , interested as always in reviving the spirit of the ancient Roman conquerors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used and imperiously ordered the lake drained . <P> Through a Roman-style aqueduct tunneled under the surrounding mountains , electric pumps began sluicing 4,500,000 cu . ft. of water per day . Nearly three years later , the level of the lake lowered some 60 feet , two crumbling skeleton frameworks lay exposed . Made of oak , pine and fir , covered with woolen cloth and sheathed outside with lead studded with bronze , the saucer-bottomed ships were 220 and 235 feet long . To facilitate navigation on the tiny lake , a pair of rudders could be fixed to either end of each barge . Lead piping indicated that fountains and gardens had once decorated the broad decks , but all this grandeur had fallen through into the mud which filled the holds . <P> Purpose of these oversized pleasure craft on the tiny lake remained largely a matter of speculation . Best bet was that tyrannical Caligula used them to escape political or physical heat in Rome , taking with him his debauched court for protracted binges . Legend had it that from just such a party the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ships sunk with all on board . More probable , in view of the paucity of precious metals found on them , was the contention that succeeding rulers , sick of anything remotely pertaining to the hated Caligula , stripped the ships and allowed them to rot . <P> Last week on April 21 , 2,695th anniversary of the birth of Rome , the ships , beached and mounted on concrete , housed in a specially constructed museum on the shores of the lake in which they had lain for 1,900 years , were placed on exhibition by Benito Mussolini .
