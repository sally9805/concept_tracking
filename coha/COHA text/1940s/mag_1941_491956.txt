14 TWENTY years after Lincoln 's death no vestige remained of the Illinois village where he spent six of his formative years . Yet if Lincoln were to return to New Salem in 1941 he would see that frontier settlement almost as he left it in 1837 . As in Henry Ford 's Greenfield Village , the visitors ' automobiles are halted at the gates and the tourists themselves are the only modern note . Lincoln would find the stumps of the newly logged  --  in the 1830 's  --  original forest just as he remembered them . Stumps have been dug carefully out of neighboring woods and resunk in the townsite . Some of them are mere shells concealing the hydrants installed to protect the restored cabins from fire , but you would not know this if you were not told , nor would he . When William Randolph Hearst still was young and running for office , he lectured often on the Chautauqua circuits . In 1906 he spoke at a Chautauqua meeting in Petersburg , Illinois . The local directors took him , on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pasture overgrown with brush . This , they told him , was the site of the vanished New Salem . The only indications of the lost town of Lincoln 's young manhood were a few sunken spots evidently marking former cellars . The last cabin had collapsed about 1880 . In his interest in Lincoln , Mr. Hearst bought the sixty acres of the townsite that fall of 1906 for $11,000 , deeding the land in trust to the Old Salem Chautauqua Association of Petersburg . Little happened for eleven years until , in 1917 , a group of enthusiasts in Petersburg incorporated the Old Salem-Lincoln League and set out to restore the village as it had been when Lincoln left it for Springfield . Though Petersburg is a small county-seat town , the League put up reproductions of five or six cabins . Then , the money giving out , the Chautauqua Association deeded the property , in 1919 , to the State of Illinois on the condition that the state finish the work . Two years later , on the completion of a stone museum , the tract was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1933 thirteen cabins had been built and furnished , parking facilities and a water supply provided . and landscaping done , but it was nut until the advent of the CCC and Federal funds , in 1934 , that the restoration began to move rapidly toward completion . When the 1941 tourist season opens , the pilgrim will find twenty-two of old New Salem 's twenty-five buildings , at its zenith , faithfully reproduced precisely where they stood , in identical surroundings and with nearly identical furnishings . Here , as of the resurrection MOM , is just such a frontier settlement as was home to the ancestors of some millions of Americans of today . Patient and loving labor and re search have managed it . It was an accident that Lincoln settled in this ill-begotten village . With his employer , Denton ( Rut , his cousin , Dennis Hanks , and his stepbrother , John D. Johnston , he had built a flatboat on the Sangamon River in 1831 and set oft to New Orleans with a load of produce to trade for Spanish dollars . The flatboat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had built on the river three years before , founding the settlement . The flatboat party went on to New Orleans after the settlers had helped them to dislodge their craft . but Oflut , with a sure instinct for failure , came buck to rent the mill and to open a store at Nev . ' Salem , and he hired Lincoln to watch the mill and tend the store . In a few months Offut fled , leaving Lincoln to make such settlement with OtTut 's creditors as he could . Here at New Salem , Lincoln split rails , such rails as you see in the reproduced fences now . Here he outwrestled Jack Armstrong , soldiered briefly in the Black Hawk War , served as postmaster , for which he got in fees about fifty-five dollars u year , bought several stores , failed in business and took on debts he was fifteen hard years in paying off ; studied law from ti stray copy of Blackstone ; learned enough surveying to lay out towns and roads , and was elected to the Illinois legislature .

Two years after Lincoln moved to Springfield , Menard County was set off from Sangamon County , and a county-seat fight followed between New Salem , ( Continued on Pee . 59 ? he knuckler as a mental hazard as much as anything else . Sometimes he throws dozens in a game , sometimes only a few . Ted said he threw only five knucklers when he stopped the Yanks cold in that 1-0 victory last August . " Actually , I do n't think the butterfly is so hard to hit , " Lyons comments . Batters who face him disagree . Lyons is a maniac on condition . In season and out , he imposes the most rigid conditioning regime on himself . Being a bachelor , he has to consult no one on his activities off the field . Teddy admits he almost married his campus sweetheart at Baylor , but that is as far as he goes in discussing his affairs of the heart . In season , the big right-hander plays a little golf on off days and spends his evenings show-going , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basketball during the winter , but cut that out when an elbow injury worried him . Now he spends the fall tearing around the Southwest for football games , sandwiching in all the hunting possible . He likes to hunt all the game down his way . " I once went hunting for quail and came home with an eight-foot alligator , " he relates . Hunting , fishing and golf carry him through January . Then he 's off for California . Long walks and a bit of throwing and running leave him in fine condition by the time his slightly blubbery mates arrive the latter part of February for the beginning of formal spring training . Then our forty-yearold youngster steps up his program to something like this : Three hours of Petersburg and other villages . Petersburg won and the badly located older settlement collapsed almost at once , mostof the townfolk moving theircabins two miles to Petersburg . By the middle 1840 's only two buildings remained , one the Rutledge tavern , the town 's original structure and the one which survived until about 1880 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Hearst bought it from them . While the Old Salem-Lincoln League ran out of money early , it never ran out of enthusiasm , and for many years its members , aided by the Illinois Department of Public Works and Buildings , traced down every possible source of information about the dead village , studying the ground and old plats minutely , interviewing old settlers , reading old letters , biographies , histories , magazine and newspaper files . Test excavations turned up old walls and fireplace foundations , and finally as a result of their efforts the archaeologists knew New Salem as intimately as Lincoln had . Frontier architecture was not so uniform as is commonly supposed . New Salem 's homes varied from the two-story log structure of Samuel Hill to the dogtrot cabin of Jack Kelso and his blacksmith brother-in-law , Josh Miller . Some of the cabins had stone fireplaces , others were of handmade bricks , and many of the chimneys were of mortar and wood of the cat-and-clay type . The Rutledge tavern , built at the junction of the Springfield and the Beardstown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lean-to and a loft in which the traveler ' lent tin. ? t practice with the club in the morning  --  running , batting and throwing  --  lunch , eighteen holes of golf in the afternoon ; then dinner and a movie , card game , prize fight or something else to keep him occupied until midnight . Eight hours of sleep and he 's ready to start all over again . In contrast to most players , who consider spring training drudgery , Ted loves it . But this is n't the sharpest contrast between Ted and other players . Lyons is one ballplayer who actually spends money . Quick on the draw on all occasions , he is known as a soft touch throughout the league . Ballplayers or ex-players in need seek him out wherever he goes . As one White Sox official said , " They usually get five or ten . " And he 's just as generous with his time , always willing to cheer up sick kids in hospitals , attend luncheons , civic meetings , and so on . He figures it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typical incident several years ago . A poker game was breaking up among White Sox players on the train . Lyons was the winner . Frenchy Bordagaray , among the losers , had dropped seven dollars . " Ted , you won . Why do n't you buy me supper ? " asked Frenchy . " Sure , come on . I 'll buy . " Bordagaray ordered a chicken sandwich . He ordered two more . Then , warming to his task , Frenchy devoured a bowl of soup , two club sandwiches , two pieces of pie and two double orders of ice cream . The bill ? Seven dollars and fifty cents . " Frenchy , " said Lyons , " I wonder what I 'd be stuck for if you 'd been a big loser . " of the cabins were of one or two rooms only , usually with a lean-to . The only sheathed building in old New Salem was the store which William G. Greene bought and sold on the same day to Lincoln and Berry , out of which deal Greene was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this store . In the restoration , all logs were saturated with zinc chloride under high pressure . They should last for five hundred years . The wall logs were added on all sides , presenting clean , smooth surfaces . The spaces between the logs are chinked with wedges of wood and plastered with lime for weatherproofing . The corners are fitted into neat notches , usually of the dovetail , saddle-and-flush type . The floors are either of sawn boards or of puncheon logs . Zeal and persuasion were needed to furnish the buildings with the equipment of their times . League members searched the attics , woodsheds , barns and smokehouses of all that region of Illinois , pleading for contributions of old china , kitchen ware , pewter , furniture , spinning wheels , flax wheels , looms or any other object surely of the period . Families do not part eagerly with their heirlooms , but for this cause they surrendered them , often with tears in their eyes . Some of these antiques actually had been used in New Salem a century ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of whom still live in the vicinity . Contributions of equipment came from most of the forty-eight states , and in two or three instances persons asked for and were granted the privilege of furnishing a cabin completely . The only original building in the restoration is Henry Onstot 's cooper shop , where he made tubs , buckets and barrels , in which last the countryside usually shipped its surplus produce down-river . In the exodus this building was moved to Petersburg , weather-boarded and occupied as a home for nearly a century . The League verified its identity , bought it at an estate sale and moved it back to its original site , minus its weatherboards and interior finish . It was before the fireplace in this cabin that Lincoln lay while he studied surveying in order to qualify as deputy surveyor of Sangamon County . Joshua Miller 's blacksmith shop has been re-created with all of its equipment . So with Robert Johnson 's wheelwright shop , where he made spinning wheels , looms and furniture as well ; Peter Lukina ' cobbler shop , the surgeries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Denton Offut store , the Berry &; Lincoln store , the McNeil &; Hill store and the post office . The shop where rabbit and coon skins were shaped into hats has been restored , but not its equipment as yet . Only the John Camron home , the home and tannery of Philemon Morris and the Samuel Hill carding mill are as yet unprovided for . The re-creation of the CamronRutledge mill was a major task . The mill had been razed in the 50 's and replaced by another , vanished in turn . No one living remembered what the first mill had been like , and the Sangamon had shifted its course meanwhile , leaving the site landlocked . Slowly the search turned up the dimensions and details of the original mill . The engineering department of the University of Illinois checked the data and built a working model of the water wheel . The CCC built a large-scale model of the mill . But the problem of the river remained . The obstacles to changing the Sangamon 's course back were prohibitive , yet to reproduce the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set for the restoration . As a compromise , the river wax left in its present banks and a huge millpond dredged behind the original mill site , to be fed by water pumped from the Sangamon . By the summer of 1941 the reproduced mill should be grinding flour and cutting logs into boards . There is an old story in Menard County of the pioneer who , making his first trip to the mill with a load of grist , found it deserted . Hearing a ringing voice in the distance , he followed the sound to the top of the hill and to Offut 's store , where he found Abe Lincoln sprawled in a low chair , his long legs on the counter . Lincoln was singing a hymn in a voice that shook the rafters . The original dam and mill foundations were built of log cribbing , anchored with stones . When the site first was uncovered in 1936 , the cribbing was found in place , the location of the posts determined and the tub floor , main shaft bearings and many metal parte @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the village , and Lincoln and William F. Berry , who had bought out Greene in 1833 , ambitiously bought out Several of their competitors , taking on a debt said to have been 81200 , which Lincoln spoke of as the " national debt . " In 1833 the county commissioners licensed Berry Lincoln to keep a tavern and to sell liquor , though they never used their tavern license . Lincoln , disliking the liquor trade and his partner 's hard drinking , sold out to Berry , taking Berry 's notes . The latter not only were uncollectible , but the store debt descended to Lincoln . Yet a few yards west of where Lincoln failed was a thriving store opened in 1829 by Sam Hill and John " McNeil , " whose real name was McNamar . The first store to be opened in New Salem , it was the last to close when the village died , and it made money for its owners throughout . It was McNamar who had courted Ann Rutledge , and apparently successfully , only to return East and not come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Continued on Page 631 ( Continued from Page 60 ) It was in this store that New Salem 's first post office was opened on Christmas Day , 1829 , with Hill as postmaster . One story is that Hill gave so much attention to the liquor trade and so little to the mail that the women of the settlement petitioned for his discharge and the appointment of Lincoln . In any case , Andrew Jackson , a Democrat , named Lincoln , a Whig , as postmaster , in 1833 , and Lincoln ran the post office in Hill 's store until the office was suspended in 1836 . On Lincoln 's Birthday last year Postmaster General Farley reopened the post office after 104 years , this time as " Lincoln 's New Salem , " which cancellation appears on the tourists ' post cards . Collectors poured 35,000 pieces of mail through the little office that day for first-day cancellations . Lincoln 's fees as postmaster for the fiscal year ending March 31 , 1815 , were $55.70 , but the mail came only once a week . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently , Roy E. Larsen , president of Time , Inc. , said that though Lincoln trudged miles to borrow books , he could n't have borrowed magazines in that day because there were none in the region to be had . New Salem 's Literature Mr. Larsen was wrong in this . In their researches for their forthcoming book , Abe Lincoln and His First Partner , Robert Barton and Zarel Spears were unable to trace the number and kind of periodicals which passed through New Salem 's post office in Lincoln 's time . They did , however , find the records of the Jacksonville post office , only thirty-five mites distant and not then so much larger . No less than 133 periodicals were received on subscription at the Jacksonville post office in 1835 . Fifty-four were religious papers . The Louisville Public Advertiser , a Jacksonian organ , was the most widely read newspaper , with twenty-two subscribers . Among secular magazines , The Saturday Evening the distant patch of buffalo willow that almost hides the immobile Jake . Instantly the little training caravan is galvanized into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead run across the **30;1760;TOOLONG plain . ( " De old badger , he do n't have to dig dem gophers out , " Johnny Hooks says . " He just blow his bref down de gopher hole , and de gopher got to come out . " ) The wagon follows , rocketing and bouncing , with the shaken dogs howling and fighting in the excitement . Farrior 's horse plows to a stop , and the trainer is off and runs to where Crooked Creek Jake stands on a lofty and stylish point . Incidentally , as to bird-dog style , the important thing about a point is intensity ; the ideal point is erect , with head up and the tail above the level of the dog 's back  --  the higher the better . Some people think a cautiously lifted front paw is the sine qua non of bird-dog style , but a good dog is supposed to be bold and positive , not cautious ; you see the raised forepaw on calendars , not often at field trials . Farrior runs in front of the dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five subscribers , Godey 's Lady 's Book two . It is very improbable that there were no magazines to read in New Salem . It is probable that Lincoln distributed The Post to one or two subscribers . CCC labor , Federal grants and the aid of the National Park Service , acting in conjunction with state departments , have made possible the recreation of outbuildings , rail fences , well heads , gardens and such touches as the translated stumps , greatly aiding the illusion of time turned back . They have made possible , too , roads , bridges , parking areas , trails and shelters outside the village but in the state park , now grown to 225 acres . Below the village , at the foot of the hill , is the Wagon Wheel restaurant , designed in 1830 style , built by the park authorities and leased and supervised by the state . The furnishings of the restored village include more than five hundred contemporary books , a far greater library , than Lincoln ever saw until he went to Springfield . Lincoln and Ann @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Samuel Kirkham 's grammar , across the flyleaf of which Lincoln wrote : " Ann M. Rutledge is now learning grammar . " That identical volume now is in the Library of Congress , but a copy of the 1830 edition is preserved at New Salem . From this grammar Lincoln propounded to Ann the Kirkham definition of a phrase as " an assemblage of words not constituting an entire proposition , but performing a distinct office in the structure of a sentenceor of another phrase . " Curiously , New Salem 's copy of the fifth edition of William Cullen Bryant 's poems ( 1839 ) does not contain his The Painted Cup , in which is to lie found the first known mention of the Sangamon in literature . Bryant had seen the river while on a journey to visit his brothers at Jacksonville and Princeton , Illinois ; and he wrote in 1833 : The fresh sarannas of the Sangamon Here rise in gentle swells , and the long grass PRAIRIE DOGS ( Continued from Page I8 ) and eight scattered prairie chickens burst into the air with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Farrior " squalls " at him , and the dog stops and watches the trainer guiltily . Ed Mack makes him stand for a moment , then gives him an encouraging slap on the ribs and Jake is gone again , with flying feet and merry tail . Thirty minutes later , the next dog called from the wagon is Surracho . His name , properly spelled " Sirocco , " means a hot wind , and is somewhat apt , for this rangy goose-necked painter is a fast and fiery bird dog . Last year he was a winner as a derby two-year-old ; he is as deadly on game as any backwoodsman 's meat dog , and no dog makes more stylish , breath-taking points . But for the chicken trials this year Surracho is out with a sore foot . Farrior leaves the lemon pointer down only a few minutes . But even in that time Surracho has reached a bluff ? willow and white poplar patch  --  and pointed .

His first stop in Springfield was at a cabinetmaker 's to order a single bedstead . His second was at Joshua F. Speed 's store . Speed left his own account of their first meeting . Dissipating a $17 Gloom " He came into my store , set his saddlebags on the counter and inquired what the furnishings for a single bedstead would cost , " Speed wrote . " I took a slate and pencil , made a calculation and found the sum for furnishings complete would amount to seventeen dollars . Said he : ' It probably is cheap enough , but I want to say that , cheap as it is , I have not the money to pay ; but if you will credit me until Christmas , and if my experiment here as a lawyer is a success , I will pay you then .

I have a very large room with a very large double bed in it , which you are perfectly welcome to share with me if you choose . ' ' Where is your room ! ' he asked . I pointed . Without saying a word , he took his saddlebags on his arm , went upstairs , set them on the floor , came down again , and with a face beaming with pleasure and smiles exclaimed : ' Well , Speed , I 'm moved .

Surracho 's owner , W. F. Miller , has never seen his dog work , and only through Ed Mack Farrior 's thoroughgoing sense of honor does he happen to own him . His father having been a bird-dog man , Miller wanted to acquire a field-trial dog simply for sentimental reasons , and asked Farrior to sell him the likeliest-looking puppy he had . On the day the check for $300 arrived , Miller 's brand-new dog died . Farrior offered to return the check . " Or , " he wrote , " I have another puppy that may make a good dog . I 'll give you this one for yours that died , if you prefer . " Miller agreed to the second suggestion , and the dog he got is Surracho , now in his first all-age year , one of the class dogs of the major campaigners .
