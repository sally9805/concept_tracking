Above club fights , cooking hints , quiz shows , double-dome discussions , and the other knickknacks of television , TV fans love vaudeville . TV has brought it all back-from trained dogs to baggy-pants comics . Some of it is as drearily old-hat as the Keith circuit in 1912 . But there are glittering exceptions . The hour-long Admiral Broadway Revue ( Fri. 8 p.m. , NBC-TV &; Du Mont ) is an example of good vaudeville . <P> Patter &; Pace . In the brief six weeks of its polished existence , the Revue has climbed to a 50.6 Hooperating ( bettered only by TV 's two top attractions , Milton Berle and Arthur Godfrey ) . Last week , it earned the most solid accolade of all : its sponsor , the Admiral Corp . ( radios , television sets , refrigerators ) , picked up the option for another six months . It was no small tab . The Revue is one of the costliest things of its kind ( $25,000 a week ) on TV . <P> The Admiral show is new to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in bits &; pieces for years- in Greenwich Village nightclubs , fashionable saloons on Manhattan 's East Side , and the Pocono Mountains sector of the straw-hat circuit . Its jokes and patter are brittle , rowdy , funny and full of satirical special reference . A number of its people ( most of them members of a permanent cast ) grew up in show business with such bright youngsters as Danny Kaye and Betty Garrett . By &; large , the costumes , decor and choreography are better than may be found in any nightclub and many theaters . Its smooth pace is interrupted only by a tedious five-minute commercial which not even the " muddle-talk " of old Radio Comedian Roy Atwell can speed up . <P> Bullets &; Strain . Most of the best gags are delivered by Sid Caesar ( Make Mine Manhattan ) , Comedienne Imogene Coca ( who still looks too young to have played in Hey wood Broun 's 1931 Shoot the Works ) , and Singer Mary McCarty ( Small Wonder ) . With his insane leer and try-anything manner , Caesar can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoke signals to bullets ricocheting off a rock . Rubber-faced Imogene Coca is just as funny modeling a moulting fur coat as she is imitating what Broadway columnists sometimes call a " chantootsie . " Bouncy Mary McCarty can tear apart a popular song with fine abandon or imitate a female wine-taster getting drunk on the job . As an extra dividend , man &; wife dance team Marge &; Gower Champion foot their way featly through the hour . <P> The man who pulls all of these acts together is high-strung Max Liebman , 43 , producer , director and owner of the precious package . For 16 years , Liebman has been in &; out of the Poconos , Broadway and Hollywood ( he helped tailor a number of the routines that made Danny Kaye famous ) . He thinks that turning out a highly professional show every week for TV is a " greater strain " than doing it for the stage . He was showing no particular strain last week over the news that he had a contented sponsor .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
