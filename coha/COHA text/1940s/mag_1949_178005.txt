At war 's end , the British aircraft industry gave up any immediate hope of turning out the best conventional airliners in the world . It left that to the U.S. , which in wartime had concentrated on bombers and transports ( easily convertible to commercial use ) while Britain bore down on fighter production . Instead , the British , who had led the world in developing jet engines , put their brains and money to work on jet transports , which they hoped would some day make current U.S. airliners obsolete . <P> Last week , it looked as if the British gamble was ready to pay off . At Farnborough Airfield , in Hampshire , Britain 's aircraft builders showed 180,000 spectators a fleet of sleek new commercial planes that were well ahead of anything the U.S. has in the air or abuilding . Among the 59 new fighter and commercial planes were the world 's first jet transport plane , the first turbo-prop ( turbine-driven propeller ) transport , and other turbo-prop transports ranging from feeder planes to ocean hopping giants . As an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's largest land transport plane , which had been test-hopped only a fortnight ago . Crowed the London Times : " Already America has had to buy British jet engines ; in the not far distant future , it may have to buy air frames as well . " <P> Team Play . Britain 's triumph in aircraft design was due to a combination of free-enterprising plane builders , Labor government financing and good planning . It did much to wipe out the government 's flop with the Tudor planes which had cost British taxpayers an estimated $28 to $40 million . As far back as 1942 , the government had put grizzled Baron Brabazon of Tara ( who holds Britain 's Pilot License No. 1 ) at the head of a committee which mapped out five basic postwar types to go after the world plane market . Last week prototypes of all but one ( which was never started ) were at the order-taking stage . <P> As its biggest exhibit , Britain had the Bristol Brabazon , whose eight reciprocating engines ( later to be replaced by turbo-jets ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speed , in high-altitude ( 25,000 ft. ) comfort with staterooms , bar , and movies in the lounge . For medium-range flights , Britain had the Vickers 4O-passenger Viscount and Armstrong Whitworth 's 31-passenger Apollo , both turboprops . For feeder-lines , it had both De Havilland 's reciprocating engined Dove ( eight to eleven passengers ) and Handley Page 's 22-passenger turboprop , the Mamba Marathon. * But the star of the show at Farnborough was De Havilland 's 36-passenger Comet , the first four-engined jet transport , which took off and then flashed overhead at better than 500 m.p.h . <P> U.S. airmen were not worried about the Brabazon ; they thought it too big , slow ' and expensive . But the Comet was a bird of a different feather and stood an excellent chance to cut into the transport market now dominated by U.S. planemakers . As one U.S. airman said : " America is going to have to produce something within one year . If the jets hold up to expectation , Comet will sweep the board . "       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
