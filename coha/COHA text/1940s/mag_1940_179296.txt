I SAW IT HAPPEN IN NORWAY-Carl J. Hambro-Appleton-Century ( $2.50 ) . <P> J'ACCUSE ! - THE MEN WHO BETRAYED FRANCE- Andr Simone-Dial ( $2.50 ) . <P> TRAGEDY IN FRANCE-Andr Maurois-Harper ( $2 ) . <P> EUROPE IN THE SPRING-Clare Boothe-Knopf ( $2.50 ) . <P> There is no Zola to describe The Debacle of 1940 . But the eyewitness reports have already begun . Four important books now report how Norway was seized , why Holland fell , why France folded . One is by a Norwegian ( Carl J. Hambro ) . Two are by Frenchmen ( Andr Maurois , Andr Simone ) . One is by a U. S. woman ( Clare Boothe ) . <P> Carl J. Hambro is President of the Norwegian Storting ( Parliament ) . At one o'clock in the morning of April 9 , his wife woke him up . There was an air-raid alarm . The Nazis had come . President Hambro ( now in the U. S. ) writes a simple , straightforward , courageous account of the fight of a small neutral ( Norway had no standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reservists against tanks , of the Norwegian air force ( 115 planes ) against the Nazi air armada . He describes defenseless villages bombed out of existence , King Haakon and Crown Prince Olav machine-gunned from the air , incendiary bombs dropped on the red cross on a hospital roof . Much of the book is the story of the Norwegian Government 's retreat to the north , its efforts to establish a front there . Except for the case of Quisling , " a very well-read man with a weakness for German philosophy , " Hambro specifically denies that treason played an important part in Norway 's fall . Such charges , says he , are real fifth calumny . He says all the Norwegians were brave . <P> The writer who hides his identity under the pseudonym Andr Simone may be Pertinax ( Andr Geraud ) , Andr Gide , Andr Malraux , Georges Mandel , Genevive Tabouis . All deny that they wrote J'Accuse ! The book is a lurid charge that most of France 's political and military leaders were traitors-those who were not were dupes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Senators , confidences from Cabinet Ministers , tips from newspapermen . <P> One of Author Simone 's chief complaints is that the French general staff did not rely on the Red Army during the Munich crisis . Forgotten by Author Simone apparently is the fact that a year before Munich the Soviet Government officially announced that it had executed its leading marshal and seven generals for high treason , presumably with the Germans . J'Accuse ! may be an offensive-defense from the left against mouthing charges that the Popular Front was responsible for lowering French plane production to 38 planes a month in 1937 ; that after the signing of the Berlin-Moscow pact French Communists sullenly sabotaged the defense industry ; that the battalion of Communists in General Corap 's Ninth Army caused the German break-through by turning tail as soon as the Nazis appeared .
