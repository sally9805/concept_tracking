Fastest growing business in sleepy , elm-shaded Flemington , N.J. ( pop . 2,700 ) is that of holding annual stockholders ' meetings . Last week business was brisk . In one day , stockholders of the New York Air Brake Co. , American Crystal Sugar Co. and McHutchinson &; Co. ( garden bulbs ) plumped down in chairs in the law office of sedate , greying George Knowles Large , droned through the meetings , caught the first train back to New York , virtuously felt the 50-mile trip well worth the thousands of dollars in taxes they had thus saved their companies . <P> Six years ago , Standard Oil Co . ( N.J. ) , sick of tax-hungry cities which fattened on the intangible property tax , , moved its legal residence to Flemington , the county seat where the Hauptmann trial was held . On personal property of $45,000,000 , Standard paid a tax of $301,500 . This lump sent Flemington 's tax rate of $3.91 per $100 parachuting to 67 . Since then , 135 equally tax-conscious corporations have followed Standard 's trail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax rolls . <P> Registered agent for 122 of these corporations is Lawyer Large , former county judge . Most meetings are held in his mahogany-paneled office on Flemington 's Main Street . Overflow sessions are held in the Women 's Club or in the Grange Hall , where Ladies of the Grange stuff stockholders with country fried chicken . <P> Flemington 's tax rate , now 28 and by far the lowest in New Jersey , is still dropping . By the end of next year , Flemington and Hunterdon County will have paid off $11,000 in bonded debt with city slicker money , will be debt free . What will happen then , Flemingtonians do not know . But they can dream-of a super-velvety municipal golf course , a Hollywoodian town swimming pool , even a Utopian tax holiday .
