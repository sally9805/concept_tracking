In torment Russia lashed out on the Moscow front like a wounded giant beating a beast that gnaws his vitals . Stalingrad 's peril was so great that distraction was necessary . For the desperate offensive , handsome , hard-eyed General Georgy Zhukov chose the Rzhev region , where the German lines bent within 130 miles of Moscow . One morning , early in August , deep-throated Soviet artillery opened up in the birchwood and meadow land around Rzhev . It concentrated first on Nazi battery positions , then on German division headquarters , finally on communications and transport centers . Ground-strafing Stormoviks joined the fray , followed by waves of tanks and infantry . Within a few hours hundreds of square miles were flaming with battle . <P> In one day the Red Army advanced six miles near the confluence of the Gzhat River and the mighty Volga 's headwaters . Bridgeheads were established across the Gzhat . The Russians met terrific resistance from Germans holding a railway line until a simultaneous frontal and flank assault forced a Nazi retreat . Day after day the Russians hammered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . House by house the Germans defended the city which had been their most advanced headquarters on the northern front . Churches and other thick-walled structures had been turned into small fortresses , with mortars and machine guns on the street level , tommy guns poking from every opening in the upper stories . Slowly the Red Army pushed on , clearing out every gun-bristling nest , every German battery station . After 19 days Rzhev was largely in Russian hands , its fall seemed near . <P> Last year the recapture of Rzhev would have filled Russia and her allies with rejoicing , for then Moscow was in deadly danger and it would have signaled relief . This year the danger was even graver because in the south Russia 's industrial guts were being eaten away . As yet the Rzhev offensive had done little to lessen Russia 's agony .
