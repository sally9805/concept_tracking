All U.S. automobiles made after New Year 's Day will be sans nickel , chromium or aluminum brightwork . This was the decision made last week at a three-hour Washington confab between the automakers and civilian supply boss Leon Henderson . <P> The formal order , to be issued very soon , will forbid the use of nickel , chromium , copper or aluminum in nonfunctional automobile parts . These are the principal materials in the huge shiny grilles , glistening hub caps and sparkling trim which garnish the 1942 models . An important exception : bumpers , tagged " functional " after an acrimonious Government-industry semantic fight . <P> Tough as the rule sounds , Detroit was glad to get a specific rule on brightwork . Automotive engineers have stewed over the problem for months without knowing just what goal they were working towards . Furthermore , Leon 's order may not prove so tough . Stainless steel is not-as yet-on the list of verboten materials . Even if that is taken away , the automakers have plenty of substitutes . Ford has perfected an all-glass tail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost all makers have new decorative plastics . These should keep U.S. cars the flashiest in the world .
