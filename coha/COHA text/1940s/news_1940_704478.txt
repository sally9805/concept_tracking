txt James J. Hines , formerly Tammany leader of the Eleventh Assembly District , was properly found guilty of furnishing political protection to policy gangsters headed by the late Arthur ( Dutch Schultz ) Flegenheimer , the Appellate Division decided unanimously yesterday in overruling an appeal from the General Sessions conviction and sentence to four to eight years in State 's prison . At the same time the court ordered the removal of Magistrate Hulon Capshaw from the bench in another unanimous decision . The magistrate was accused at the Hines trial of dismissing policy charges against Schultz associates at the request of Hines . Martin W. Littleton , who represented Hines in the appeal , said he would ask the Court of Appeals to review the findings of the Appellate Division . Pending this appeal , he added , he would seek an order permitting the former leader to continue at liberty in his present bail of $35,000 . The bail was fixed by Supreme Court Justice Peter Schmuck when he granted Hines a certificate of reasonable doubt after he had spent almost two weeks in jail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose conduct of the Hines prosecution first brought him serious mention as a Republican nominee for President this year , made no comment on the decision . Since Hines 's sentencing Mr. Dewey has left the conduct of the case largely to his assistants . Since the Appellate Division 's determination was unanimous , Hines must apply to it for permission to appeal further . Should this permission be refused , he then can ask the Court of Appeals for leave to appeal . Whether Hines will remain at liberty while the question of a further appeal is open had not been determined last night . Soon after the decision was announced Mr. Littleton attempted to reach an agreement with Mr. Dewey to accomplish this result , but was not successful . Under routine procedure Hines would be required to surrender himself to begin his sentence after he is officially notified of the decision . This might take place today . Meantime , Mr. Littleton may get an order continuing the bail either from the Appellate Division or any judge of the Court of Appeals , which would remain in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to appeal is pending . Only Law Issues Involved The decision of the Appellate Division was announced in a per curiam opinion following consideration of the appeal by Presiding Justice Francis Martin and Associate Justices James O'Malley , Alfred H. Townley , Edward S. Dore and Albert Cohn . The opinion noted at the outset that only questions of law were involved since Mr. Littleton had conceded that " unquestionably the testimony was sufficient prima facie to establish that the appellant was a member of the conspiracy to commit the crimes charged . " It would have been futile for him to contend otherwise , the court declared . " The contention that the operation of policy or the ' numbers game ' may not be prosecuted as a felony under the lottery section ( 1,372 Penal Law ) but only as a misdemeanor under the policy section ( 974 Penal Law ) can not be sustained , " the opinion said . " Concededly , policy was originally embraced within the lottery section . Because difficulty in securing convictions for felony was encountered , the Legislature made policy , originally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By so doing there was no intention evidenced to repeal , alter or amend the original lottery section . The new section neither ' explicitly ' referred to the old , nor did it ' directly ' repeal or amend it ( Section 2500 Penal Law ) . " It has been held that ' penal statutes even covering substantially the same offenses may stand to- gether ' ( People v. Dwyer , 215 N. Y. 46 , 52. ) ; and that where there are several sections ' the District Attorney may prosecute for the felony or for the misdemeanor as he chooses , ( People v. Bord , 243 N. Y. 595 , 596 ) . See also People v. Dewey ( 33 N. Y. St. Re . 427 ) . " Lottery is defined as a scheme for the distribution of property by chance , whether called a lottery , raffle or gift enterprise or by some other name ( Section 1370 Penal Law ) . Policy is a species of lottery whereby the chance is determined by numbers . That policy or the ' numbers game ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in other jurisdictions . " Cases such as People ex rel . Lawrence vs . Fallon ( 152 N. Y. 12 ) and Matter of Dwyer ( 14 Misc. 204 ) relied upon by the defendant are not to the contrary . They relate to distinctions between lottery and gaming , which at no time , as in the case of lottery and policy , were part of the same crime . In People vs . Weber ( 245 App . Div. 827 ) the question was not whether policy is a lottery , but whether possession of lottery slips was sufficient to justify a conviction for contriving , proposing or drawing a lottery . " We find no merit in defendant 's contention that his conviction was not supported by sufficient evidence under the provisions of Section 1,372 Penal Law , which relates to one who ' contrives , proposes or draws a lottery or assists in contriving , proposing or drawing ? ? * . ' It has been held it is proper to charge that these words ' are applicable to persons cooperating in the instituting and administering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sustain to it or to each other in rendering such cooperation . ' ( State vs . Wong Took , 147 Wash . 190 . ) Evidence Was Conceded " As already stated , it is here conceded that the evidence sufficiently established defendant was a member of the conspiracy . The People 's evidence tended to show that his contribution to the criminal purpose was the protection from prosecution and punishment for crime committed and to be committed pursuant thereto . Indeed , the People 's proof was to the effect that the ' numbers game ' could not have been carried on without such protection . Certainly , in rendering such service , defendant was lending cooperation . " The opinion held untenable Hines 's contention that the conspiracy count on which he was convicted was outlawed by the statute of limitations . Although the last overt act charged in the indictment had occurred more than two years prior to the indictment , the proof at the trial , it was said , showed that the conspiracy had continued to within two years of the time the indictment was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law raised by The appellant and find nothing which would justify reversal of the judgment , " the court said . Statement by Littleton " Of course the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court , in this case , was an intermediary court , " Mr. Littleton said when informed of the decision . " It did not matter who won ; Mr. Dewey could have appealed from a reversal . We shall immediately apply to a member of the Court of Appeals for a review of the decision and also asks for a certificate which will permit the freedom of Mr. Hines pending determination of the appeal . If the Appellate Division has ruled that policy is a lottery it has established a precedent never before set up in this State . I know of no State where policy is legally accepted as a lottery . This case is of national importance . " He said that Hines could be produced within a few hours to begin his sentence should Mr. Dewey request it .                @ @ @ @ @
