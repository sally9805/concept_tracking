THE GREEN-EYED CAT A STORY BY MARJORIE WORTHINGTON O NE wonders who are living now in those gay villas , large and small , which dot the fringes of the Mediterranean shore between Cannes and Marseilles where we once lived in voluntary exile . Most of us have been gone from them these several years , with the first rumbles of disaster ; some , being English , were ordered home ; others , being American , were " advised " to flee . Whatever the reasons we are there no more  --  with our berets and sandals and pajamas and backless frocks . But the houses , with the purple bougainvillea vines and the yellow mimosa , and the courtyards with fig trees and lemon trees , and the terraces where we gave our cocktail parties and moonlight buffet suppers  --  they are still there , in that Unoccupied Zone . I am thinking of them as they have probably become ; the large ones pensions de famille perhaps ; the smaller ones still boarded up as we left them . Sometimes on nights when I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Villa des Roseaux with its face to the sea and the courtyard with the platane trees at its back . And I know that on the flagstones of the court , come for food but ready to disappear at the first alarm , sits a green-eyed cat . I am as sure of it as I am of the mistral rattling the windows and wiping the terraces clean . Two Americans lived in the Villa des Roseaux , a man and his wife . It was situated by the sea on the small isthmusof La Gorguette , between the fishing villages of Bandol and San ary , Our small white house was on a hill , looking down on the Mediterranean , and when we went swimming each day we had to pass the villa and walk along the wall in front . We had lived on La Gorguette for several years before they came . We owned our house , but they had to rent theirs because the owner was dead and there was some litigation among the heirs . That was their one piece of luck ? that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had heard rumors about the Martins before they came . Ile was a celebrity of some note and she was his new wife . The villa had been empty a long time . It was a large and cumbersome affair , with twenty rooms or so , lavishly furnished and utterly unlivable except for the bedrooms . There was a two-car garage with a studio over it and a dipendance which was the servants ' quarters . There was a garden at the side overrun with weeds and one at the back with a pomegranate tree . But the most outstanding feature of the Villa des Roseaux was the courtyard , paved in stone and laid out like a park with tall platane trees that kept the sun away  --  the beautiful sun of the Midi , its chief attraction . No matter how bright the day , the courtyard was always in shadow . No matter how blue the Mediterranean or how it danced with whitecaps , the view was cut off from the courtyard by id e4iNTOMP the house and the walls . And yet it was here that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had their meals served at a table covered with oilcloth , like a peasant 's table ; and it was here they drank their endless ap6ritifs and received their guests . At night they had candles in bocaux , large glass jars , so the wind would n't blow out the flame . The house seemed used by them only to sleep in . We talked about calling on the Martins but kept putting it off the way all things were put off in the south . We heard from mutual friends that we should find them highly entertaining . What am I saying ? It was always we should find him this or that . Nobody told us anything about her . At any rate my visit was made by accident . I had n't planned the call , but one afternoon as I was passing the villa I looked over the wall and saw her seated in the courtyard alone . " Why not ? " I asked myself and walked in through the gate . She was in a chair by the table , and as I approached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet . There were about five kittens in the basket and a large full-grown mother cat . She rose in some embarrassment when she noticed me but she put out her hand and said , " Oh , how do you do ? " I introduced myself and said a few polite or apologetic words , and all the time of course I was observing her . She might have been twenty-five or six , a slender young woman with a pale oval face , very pale blond hair worn in a coronet braid , a rather pointed nose , and oversized eyes with pupils so large it was almost impossible to tell what color the eyes were . She was dressed in a peasanty sort of thing , with a tight bodice , fitted waist , and full skirt . On her bare feet were white espadrilles with red lacings . The first thing she said after I had introduced myself was : " The people round here have heard I like cats . A little girl brought me three kittens last week . . . . I could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were so sweet . But then somebody else brought me a tomcat that had no home , and now to-day a woman from the village walked all the way out here with this whole little family because she was moving away and could n't take them with her . " " That makes a lot of cats , " I said . " Ten , " she said tragically . I have never seen so sad a face . I wondered what she would look like when she smiled . She seemed lost in contemplation of the mother and kittens . Then suddenly color came into her cheeks , she looked at me as if for the first time , and in a small voice I could barely hear she said : " Oh . I must tell my husband you are calling on him . Please excuse me . Wo n't you sit down ? I 'll just be a moment . " She ran into the house and I passed the time playing with the kittens and complimenting the mother , and wishing I had postponed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on both of the Martins , not on him , as she seemed to take for granted . He came out however and greeted me very cordially , and after that his wife , the cats , and the courtyard all faded , the way things do in a movie when the director wants to focus attention on the principal character . He was , without a doubt , the most fascinating , attractive , and charming man I 've ever met . He was about six feet tall , heavily built , with a clean-shaven face and light-brown hair just beginning to turn gray . He wore the casual clothes most of the men wore ? loose sailor 's trousers of blue denim , a short-sleeved tricot shirt , and capuchin sandals  --  but he wore them with an ease that made them really smart . He made me feel in less than fifteen minutes that I was beautiful and actually a most seductive woman in spite of my years ! ( He was like that , I learned later , with all women , young and old . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women and thrived on their adulation . A few From Giulia I learned that Mr. Mar-tin was tres dzfficile and had a bad temper home , and never came to meals on at Madame , on the other hand , was very gentile . She actually gave Anna her old clothes , instead of selling them to her , as most French women do . And she never complained about anything . When Anna told her that the linen sheets ( " So large , madame , they would make shrouds for a regiment ! " ) were disappearing , she refused to have Madeleine 's room searched , though everyone in Banded knew what a thief that Madeleine was ! And even if the food was scorched she said nothing . Monsieur Martin was close about food , allowing only a few francs a day per person , while he spent fortunes each week on alcohol and wines . And then Giulia said : " And the cats . " " What ? " I asked . The remark seemed irrelevant . " Ten of them , and some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are always hungry because they are allowed only a franc 's worth of mou a day for all of them . . . and one liter of milk , which must do for the household as well . It is formidable ! " Giulia had the Italian 's contempt for any four-legged beast that was neither edible nor able to work for its living . " And each one has a name , such as Adele or Pistaloun , and Madame Martin fusses about them as if they were her own children . But just the same , she loves her husband ; that is obvious . It is always ' Monsieur wishes this , ' or ' Monsieur does not wish that , ' or Monsieur is not to be disturbed . ' Anna , who is a devout Catholic like myself , says sometimes , forgive us , it is like a nun worshipping . That is not healthy . A man should be told what 's what from time to time , for his own good , do n't you think , Madame ? " We invited the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wore the white crepe de chine Mainbocher made for me . Even as I put it on I asked myself whether Mr. Martin would like it . Was n't that funny ? It was a good dinner . I had hired an extra woman to help Giulia , and the service was smooth . The conversation flowed . . . . I had seated Mrs. Martin next to my young son , Tommy , who could talk with animation to a blank wall . Occasionally , from a sense of duty , I glanced down to their end of the table . She was listening , gravely . She wore a black-velvet dinner dress . With her coronet of blond hair and the fair skin , it was very becoming  --  but fancy wearing black velvet to a dinner on the Mediterranean ! I do n't know what started the conversation about bullfights . Perhaps it was apropos of Hemingway . Most of us had attended a bullfight or two in Spain , but Mr. Martin told of one he had seen in the south of France , at Arles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wished , and we listened with absorbed attention , until someone at the far end of the table upset a glass of wine . It was Mrs. Martin . Her husband glanced in that direction , paused , and then , with a laugh , went on : " Marylin is probably remembering the bullfight at Arles . It was the first she had seen and she had n't wanted to go . I persuaded her it was something everyone had to see at least once  --  part of her education . It was a hot day . The bulls were stupid and sluggish . They did n't want to fight and everyone was getting pretty disgusted with them . But Marylin , as usual , took the bulls ' part . She kept saying , ' Why do they force them to fight if they do n't want to ? It 's cruel . . . " But at last things began to get more interesting . There came the featured bullfight , the one everybody had come to see . Unfortunately one of the horses was gored . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't a chance , you know ; but the toreador was good  --  more than that , he was a genius ! It gave me a thrill to watch him because of the expertness of the thing . It was beautiful as a ballet . Everyone in that enormous old ruin of a Roman amphi-theater was spellbound . It lacked only a second or two for the climax  --  the mortal thrust . You could have played a melody on the nerves of the audience , they were so taut . And just at that moment , my little Marylin fainted and had to be carried out . " There were polite murmurs around the table , somebody giggled nervously . I was distracted for a second because Giulia was bringing in the geiteau a la creme and I was anxious for it to be a success . Mr. Martin spoke again . " I guess the word for my wife is zoliphile . " He leaned forward and looked down the table and smiled condescendingly at Mrs. Martin , whose glass was being refilled with wine . " She prefers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She looked back at him and said softly , " Animals are kinder than people . " " Not cats surely ? " someone protested . " Have you ever watched them with smaller animals  --  chipmunks , mice , and birds ? " She gave a slight shudder . Then she said , " It 's unfortunate but not their fault . Those arc the laws of the cat world . It is something we ca n't understand , but it 's all right for cats because it is taught to them and it is the law of their world . . . . " Her voice faded almost to a whisper . Then she drew a deep breath and her voice got stronger : " But people have a different law , made just for them and taught them when they are children and even written in a Book they all read . There is no excuse for people being cruel . Yet they are always torturing one another . . . always . . . . " She unclasped her hands and dropped them . Her glance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it reached her husband . The color left her cheeks but she did not lower her gaze . Then gradually the emotion that had lighted her burned out . She was cold and pale and still again . There was general conversation . The dessert was consumed and we moved into the living room for coffee . MAGAZINE The season passed quickly . I remember only a few incidents , and it 's queer that one of them should be the night we were dining at the Villa des Roseaux when Marylin Martin found the green-eyed cat and fed it . We were having cocktails in the gloomy courtyard . The sun had not yet set and there was a kind of yellowish sunset . Mrs. Martin had passed some little messes round that Madeleine had probably persuaded her would do for canapes . I was sipping my drink when I saw my hostess rise and walk toward the gates . At the entrance to the villa stood a cat , one of the worst specimens of the breed I have ever seen . It was hunched up in the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin as my little finger , and its tail was long and furless , like a rat 's . I followed Mrs. Martin , holding my glass . I saw her bend over the animal and I heard her murmuring strange little sounds to it . She seemed to know I was behind her , because without turning her head she said , " Will you please ask the cook for a little meat ? " I ran back to the kitchen . Over the stove , preparing dinner , was the gypsy cook , her black hair in disorder and her faze flushed . I delivered the message , and with a stream of local oaths she cut a slab of beefsteak from a piece obviously waiting to be cooked for our dinner I accepted it and ran . Mrs. Martin tore off a chunk with her fingers and , kneeling , offered it to the cat . It was then I noticed what extraordinary green eyes the animal had . They gleamed like jewels . They were also the color of the Mediterranean on a clear day , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , aside from the remarkable eyes , that cat was the most unprepossessing creature I 've ever seen in my life . As Mrs. Martin continued coaxing it the cat moved closer to her . Then with a sudden quick movement it tore the meat from her fingers and swallowed it . The next minute it gave a convulsive quiver , its short legs folded up under the distorted body , and the cat lay on its side unable to right itself . " Poor thing ! " Mrs. Martin cried , tears streaming down her cheeks . " It was starving . " She gathered the cat in her arms and entered the house . She appeared at her place for dinner , was completely silent during the meal , and disappeared soon after . It was along about August that the opera singer arrived to visit the Martins at the Villa des Roseaux . She was a dynamic woman in her early thirties , handsome , with dark hair and heavily made-up face . She had a propensity toward fat of course , like most singers ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a beautiful figure which she showed to advantage as far as possible . She was n't a full-fledged Met star  --  just an American singer who had secured an engagement at the opera in Monte Carlo . But her voice was n't bad . It had a certain quality , and what it lacked in tone it made up for in volume . And someone at least had backed her to a wardrobe of marvelous clothes that made even my one Mainbochcr look like a limp rag . She had no false modesty . She liked to sing , and at the flicker of an eyelash she would burst into arias from " Thais " and " Manon " ? showy bits , and as she sang she would strut about , showing off that fine figure of hers and thinking she was acting . Right ! I did n't care much for her , and in fact , none of us did  --  except Peter Martin . She seemed to be exactly what he had always been seeking in women . He reveled in her and tried to force her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had plunged into one of those equatorial affairs that make people totally oblivious to the feelings of anyone about them . Almost before we realized it she had become the actual mistress of Les Roseaux . It was she who gave orders to the servants and made them toe the mark . It was she who did the planning of meals and made Madeleine , the gypsy , clean up her kitchen . Giulia told meall about it . She called it that grand scandal at the villa below , We felt sorry for Mrs. Martin of course and championed her for a time among ourselves , and then , as is usually the case , pity gave way to contempt . None of us would stand for our husbands setting up a mistress in our house ! We continued going to the Martins ' parties though and asking them to ours , because he really was entertaining and , after all , a celebrity . And , besides , it would have been too much trouble to make an open rift . It was none of our business how the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ famous men would bear close inspection . One day Giulia came to me in great excitement . The gardener of the Martins had been up asking to borrow a large gunny sack which he knew was in our garage . Giulia asked why he wanted it and with a broad grin the gardener said , " To drown the cats . " " Kittens ? " Giulia asked . " Cats , " said Wioland . " Cats . All of them . There has been a scene . . oh , la Ia . . . what a one ! " The opera singer liked birds and hated cats . She said they were cruel and wicked . So Mr. Martin drank a lot of liquor and announced he had been sick of cats for a long time . That to have one around was all right , but to have ten cats in one household made them look . . . eccentric . Anna , weeping , told Giulia that night what happened . One by one Wioland trapped the cats and put them in the sack , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , could not be caught . Malformed as it was , the green-eyed cat proved quicker and more agile than the rest , to say nothing of being infinitely warier . At last she found a perch in a branch of a platane tree and sat there licking her paws and staring at him . Wioland , the gardener , shook his fist up at the tree , and went into the house for the master 's shotgun . He fired three times . " And where was Madame Martin during all this ? " I asked Giulia . Ah , there had been a scene of course . She had been really angry , she threatened this and that , then she pleaded and wept , and finally she locked herself in the studio over the garage where she could not hear or see what was going on , " And so the gardener shot the crippled cat and drowned the rest ? " " The rest he drowned , " Giulia said , " and he boasted he had hit the Rebouglie with his first bullet . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his life  --  not even a rabbit . He is a terrible liar . . . and now he who has sworn a pledge and given it to the priest , never to drink anything stronger than wine , is drinking dry all the cafes on the waterfront of Bandol and telling everyone who will listen and buy him more pasta , how he got the better of the cat that the devil spawned . .. so we know he is lying again . " That week-end we had a number of guests , most of whom left Sunday afternoon by car . But there was one who was taking the midnight train to Paris and we went to the station in Bandol to see him off . It was dark on the platform and the train was late . We spent the time walking up and down and talking . Somebody was seated on a bench near the end of the platform , a woman . But it was dark and we could make out no more than her general outline . It was only when the train came rushing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognized the solitary traveler . It was Mrs. Martin , in traveling clothes , carrying a suitcase . " Going to Paris ? " I asked stupidly . She smiled , put out her little gloved hand , and shook mine , then my husband 's , and nodded to our guest . " Good-by , " she said and climbed into a second-class compartment . Our friend had entered one reserved for smokers , and at first I was sorry , because he liked pretty women and might have sat with her during the journey . Butthen I remembered how shy she was and thought she would probably prefer being alone . That was the last any of us ever saw of Mrs. Martin . The next morning the milkman , making his rounds , stopped first , at six o'clock , at the Villa des Roseaux . The weather was fine . Three , days of mistral had blown the clouds and dust away . The Mediterranean was blue , the sky clear . And the milkman , who had just left his bride of a month sleeping contentedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vender , " a song which the loudspeakers along the quai were blasting that season . Although he planned , as usual , to leave something Less than a liter of bluish milk in the covered pan the Martins ' cook put out for him , his conscience did n't trouble him , The smallest order one ought to expect from such a house was three liters . Mean people deserved to be cheated a little . He entered the gates of the Villa des Roseaux , swinging his pail and ladle . But as he saw the table with the oilcloth cover he slowed his steps . Tiens ! This was a pretty state of affairs . The master and his woman guest had obviously fallen asleep last night over their whiskies , and nobody had had the delicacy to put them to bed The milkman walked softly so as not to disturb them . He was looking for Madeleine 's receptacle , but it was n't on the table where he usually found it . There was only a nearly empty bottle and two glasses , and the master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The woman who , people said , was a singer of operas , lay back in her chair with her face upturned . Her eyes , strangely enough , were open . Warily the milkman came closer .. . he was fascinated by something he now saw . The bosom of the singer 's dress was dyed crimson . . . and  --  Mother of God I  --  that was because her throat had been slashed from ear to ear . It was then he became conscious of a strange soft sound and , looking up in the direction in which the woman 's eyes were staring , he swears he saw the green-eyed cat , in the branches of the platane tree . It was a horrible thing to have happened on our lovely shore . We could talk of nothing else for months , and it cast a cloud over all of us . There was something particularly gruesome in the thought of those two out there all night ? in the courtyard where nightingales have been known to sing : the man whose sins we had forgiven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drugged torpor , while the singer sat opposite all night long , with her white throat gashed and her Paris gown stained an ugly red . It was so brutal we hated to believe the coroner 's verdict that accused gentle Mrs. Martin of the deed . " Vengeance , " the inquest decided . " Crime passionel . " I often remember how calm she was when she said good-by to us that night on the Bandol platform . She had seemed in perfect possession of her mind , and somehow , now that I think of it , at peace . Giulia , in the rare letters that come through to me. now from the south of France , has written that the green-eyed cat , whom Wioland swears he shot with the master 's rifle , is seen occasionally in the courtyard of the Villa des Roseaux . I suppose it is starving again , poor thing .
