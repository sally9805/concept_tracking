From the German prison camp designated as Stalag XX a British soldier wrote to his small daughter : <P> In a burrow like a bunny father has his little lair , <P> Sleeps and eats and reads and lazes , sometimes coming tip for air ; <P> Puts his head beneath a trickle when he wants to have a wash , <P> Bumping into other bunnies cause there 's something of a squash , <P> Every morning he is counted , every midday he is fed , <P> And they lock him in his burrow when it 's time to go to bed . <P> If he wants to go out walking , lots of beefy men with guns <P> Say they 'd like to come out with him just , you see , in case he runs . <P> Many , many times I 've wondered what it would be like to go <P> Down dark , damp and draughty tunnels like a bunny-now I know !
