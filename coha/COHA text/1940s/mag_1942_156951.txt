Not since the day of Munich had the British press given such play to any single story . War news was all but pushed from the pages of London 's war-curtailed dail ies . Many of them devoted half their space to news of the document which , in the midst of war , looked forward to a better post-war world . The Beveridge Report , published last week , was the biggest domestic event for Britons in many years . <P> Sir William Henry Beveridge 's report ran to 200,000 words . Work had begun on it 18 months ago , when the white-haired economist was appointed by the then Minister of Reconstruction , Arthur Green wood , to " survey . . . existing national schemes of social insurance and allied services . . . and to make recommendations . " Sir William had written the bulk of his report in longhand . Now it was before the public , and the public was eating it up . <P> Within five hours of publication it had sold 70,000 copies , by the week 's end 90,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposed a comprehensive , compulsory system of social insurance for every man , woman and child in the British Isles , regardless of age , income or class , with premiums to be paid by the individual , his employer and the State ( TIME , Dec. 7 ) . But contrary to general pre-publication expectation there was not a revolutionary idea in the whole report . What Sir William proposed , in the words of Britain 's steady , influential weekly The Economist , was " a plan for the security of incomes up to a minimum level . . . based upon existing schemes and existing methods . " <P> The Enthusiasts . First reaction of press and public was one of almost unanimous approval . Said the London Times , traditionally first newspaper on the break fast tables of Britain 's rulers : " A momentous document which should and must exercise a profound and immediate in fluence on the direction of social change in Britain . " Other comments : Telegraph : " The consummation of the revolution begun by Mr. Lloyd George in 1911 . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the establishment of a national minimum level of subsistence . " Manchester Guardian : " A big and fine thing . " Daily Worker : " A courageous attempt ... to alleviate some of the worst evils of present-day society . . . . The main principles . . . will be endorsed by all progressive opinion . " The man in the street : " A bit of all right . " The Plan . The Beveridge plan foresaw joint contributions by employer and employe of a maximum of 75 6d ( $1.50 ) weekly , of which the employer would pay 33 3d ( 65 ) , the employe 45 3d , which would be deducted automatically from his wages . Remaining cost would be borne by the Treasury . <P> In the first year of application ( 1945 ) the cost would be distributed as follows : 351,000,000 from the Treasury ; 194,000,000 from insurees ; 137,000,000 from employers , and 15,000,000 from interest .
