Ever since it was founded in 1869 , Manhattan 's great American Museum of Natural History has felt self-conscious about a gap in its collection of animal skeletons-the skull of the rare , nearly extinct Java rhinoceros , which has never been shown in any zoo on earth . Since 1920 the museum has sent many expeditions , financed by Trustee Arthur Vernay , to Malaya on fruitless searches for the shy beast . <P> But the museum has its rhino skull at last . It was found amid a heap of dusty bones in the Museum 's attic , where it has lain since 1869 . <P> Trustee Vernay had not yet been notified of the good news last week . Said a curator : " We 're afraid to tell him . "
