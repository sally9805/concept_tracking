txt ? Consumers are turning out on Capitol Hill in fuller force than ever before to push for continuation of price control . They are not all united in just how far they think the Government should go at this time to stabilize the economy of the average American family , but there is no doubt that , in their support of price control now and during the postwar transition period , they are a great comfort to OPA Administrator Chester Bowles . beset as he is by certain manufacturers anxious to see control end . A group of 12 women 's organizations that appeared before the Senate Banking and Currency Committee a few days ago to urge renewal of emergency price con- ' trol after it expires June 30 claimed to represent 12.000,000 members , and to " speak for citizens in general , for the public welfare and the nation 's interest , rather than on behalf of some special groups . " They pointed to " colmtless examples during the past year . of selfish forces attempting to weaken the program of economic stabilization , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advised his clients to " prepare amendments to the OPA act I as a threat and to push with or ' ganized political pressure if found necessary when the OPA seeks another year 's extension . " Only 3,500 Investigators Enough funds for proper enforcement , especially of the recent WPB-OPA clothing order to bring iprices down six to seven per cent , Os one of the consumers ' pleas . ' At present OPA has only about 3,500 investigators , little more than one for each county . Enforcement , the women said , particularly needs to be strengthened for food , clothing , housing , housefurnishings and rents . In some cities as few as two per cent of the prices are above ceilings , but in other cities more than 251 per cent are over ceiling prices , 1 OPA surveys show . Seven out of the 12 consumers groups are till asking Congress to establish quality control so as to prevent hidden price rises through deterioration of comm ) dities . They want grades or specifications to be established and show on labels . This is especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goods , because many strange brands are now appearing on store shelves , with little guide to the housewife as to what is inside the can . In its new campaign to channel cloth into essential clothing , OPA has initiated a type of quality control , but according to at least cne consumer group  --  the C. I. 0 . women 's auxiliaries  --  the method is " time-consuming , taking lots of experts and is n't always too effective . " The new OPA practice is sending its investigators out to plants to fill in charts for each price line sold in 1942 and each sold now . The charts show the kind of cloth , whether it was Sanforized , what kind of stitching was used and so forth . These charts go to experts in the national office to check to see whether the present ; shirt of a certain price is really ' the same as one that sold for the same price in March , 1942 . If the product is obviously cheaper , OPA requires the manufacturer to roll back his price and brings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sales of the shirts he has made above the 1942 price . Bowles ' Appeal Backed Consumer groups also backing up Mr. Bowles ' appeal to Congress to repeal the Bankhead amendment put in last year to raise prices for the cotton grower . " The unfair and needless burdens to purchasing industries and consumers will hang over the stabilization program so long as the amendment stands in its present form , " the women warned . In addition to Capitol Hill activity , the American Home Economics Association has announced a nation-wide campaign through local study groups to find out what women want in a few outstanding essential clothing articles , among them a house dress and a slip . Women all over the country will be asked to make up their minds what priority they would give to wearability and style in various-priced goods . Then national headquarters will take their replies and attempt to draw up " floors of quality " below which manufacturers would be guilty of wasting manpower and materials ,               @ @ @ @ @ @
