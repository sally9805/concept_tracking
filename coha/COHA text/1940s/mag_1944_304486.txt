Japan admitted another execution of U.S. prisoners . A year after the deed , the Imperial Government announced ( through the International Red Cross ) that it had done to death three Navy men captured on Bataan and Corregidor . Japan named them : Marine Sergeant Joe B. Chastain of Waco , Tex. ; Marine Corporal Victor Paliotti of Cranston , R.I. ; Seaman First Class Ferdinand Frank Meringolo of Brooklyn . <P> For the execution of the Doolittle raiders Japan had no explanation within civilized military usage ; this time , if its explanation was to be trusted , it had legal excuse . Japan 's story : the three Americans , confined in a Manchurian prison camp , had broken out , walked for ten days headed toward Russian territory . A police inspector had stopped them , been told they were stranded German flyers . They had led him into the country , ostensibly to examine their wrecked plane , there had killed him with a kitchen knife .                 @ @ @ @
