The story spread across sleepy Lake County like fire in a stand of slash pine . By nightfall all the county knew that Willie Padgett 's 17-year-old wife had been raped by four Negroes ; two of the suspects were already locked up in the county jail at Tavares . <P> Sullen , glint-eyed men collected in murmuring knots in the dusty , farm-town streets . Soon , the small angry knots had . become one 125-man mob pulling up at the Tavares courthouse in a 20-car caravan . Most of the mob stayed behind while its leaders walked up the steps to talk with big , easygoing Sheriff Willis McCall . " Willis , " said one , " we want them niggers . " <P> Buckshot for a Juke Joint . The sheriff let himself down on the steps and talked softly . " You know that when you elected me , I was sworn to uphold the law , " he said . " And I have to protect my prisoners . " Anyway , he added , the prisoners had been rushed off to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the jail at the time , but was sneaked off later . ) <P> Grumbling , the mob rode off , and almost broke up . Just for the hell of it , though , in the little fanning town of Groveland , 65 miles from Tampa and not far from Willie and Norma Padgett 's house , the men with shotguns pumped 15 loads of buckshot into a Negro-owned juke joint . Then they looked around for more Negroes-but the 400 residents of Groveland 's Negro district had been carted to safety by white citizens who feared what was coming . <P> Calm , determined Sheriff McCall put in a hurry call to Governor Fuller Warren that brought 78 National Guardsmen to the scene . Off and on for three days , small mobs , sprinkled now with strangers from other counties , cruised menacingly in cars , or shuffled through the small-town streets , but did no damage . Then , all of a sudden , they were roused again . A hundred shouting whites with rifles and pistols roared into tiny Mascotte in trucks , forced Guardsmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night . <P> At Stuckey 's Still , a bedraggled Negro home site three miles from Groveland , the band poured shots into one house ( someone thought it belonged to the father of one of the rape suspects ) and started after more . Sheriff 's men and highway police stopped them with tear-gas grenades . A few miles away , whites tossing kerosene-filled bottles burned three Negro homes to the ground . <P> <P> Uneasy Order . By midweek , National Guardsmen , swollen to 300 and mounting .50-caliber machine guns , had brought uneasy order to Lake County . A hastily summoned grand jury indicted the three jailed Negroes for rape . Scared Negroes began trickling back to their homes . It looked as if the terror had run its course , without injury to any Negro . <P> But many Lake County white men still muttered darkly . The next time , said one of their leaders , husky , brash Flowers Cockcroft , " We 'll clean out every Negro section in south Lake County . "         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
