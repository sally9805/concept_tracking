txt Treasury officials were reported authoritatively today to have discussed a modified pay-as-you-go income tax collection plan with Congressional tax experts . Under the tentative plan , taxpayers in the lowest bracket , those paying 6 per cent normal tax and 13 per cent surtax , would be put on a current basis , with last year 's tax liabilities wiped out . High-bracket individuals would escape part of last year 's liabilities and be permitted to pay the remainder in installments and achieve full current-payment status in two or three years . The lowest bracket would include taxpayers with not more than $2,000 of surtax net income . The plan would provide forgiveness of the first 19 or 20 per cent of , the rates on 1942 incomes , at least the 6 per cent normal tax and the 13 1 per cent first-bracket surtax . For simplicity , it was reported , the Treasury was inclined to favor a 20 per cent withholding tax at the source , which would be applied against the taxes on 1943 incomes . About three-fourths of all income taxpayers come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surtax is 19 per cent of income above personal exemptions and other authorized deductions . The normal tax and first bracket surtax on 1942 income would be forgiven in the higher brackets , but the taxpayers would have to arrange to pay the remainder of their 1942 tax in installments , with perhaps 2 per cent interest on the unpaid amount . The plan , still in the discussion stage , does not go as far as the system advocated by Beardsley Ruml , New York banker and merchant , who proposed forgiving all 1942 taxes to get the average citizen abreast of his financial obligations to the Government . Representative Car/son of Kansas and Senator Capper of Kansas have introduced bills based on the Ruml principle . Senator Clark of Missouri is the author of another measure which would forgive taxes on 1942 income , put a total withholding tax of 10 per cent including Victory Tax , on all incomes from $624 to $1248 a year , and 24 per cent on incomes above $1248 .
