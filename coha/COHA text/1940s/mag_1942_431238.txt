TWO years ago the German hosts , drunk with victory , stood on the English Channel and prepared exultantly for the conquest of Britain . The Nazis had swept everything before them ? Poland , Denmark , Norway , the Low ( ' ountries , France . There remained only a duster of islands nearly the size of the State of Oregon to complete the subjugation of western Europe . It looked like an easy job . The British had been thrown out of Norway . They had been sent reeling back from the front in France and Belgium , their fighting strength nearly exterminated on the beach at Dunkirk . Italy had come into the fray and japan hovered expectantly in the background . Perhaps the British , seeing what had happened to their allies , would adopt the course of wisdom and sue for peace . If they did n't , if they persisted in being stubborn ? well , the Fuehrer had had an answer for everything so far and he probably had an answer for Britain . When Blitz Met Bulldog The weeks went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hitler got ready to administer the coup de grace . Long-range guns were mounted on the French coast ; invasion barges were assembled ; troops were moved into position ; supplies were brought up ; airfields were made ready for a kind of assault unknown to the Spaniards in the days of the Armada and unknown to Napoleon . With binoculars one could see from Dover the German preparations . Britain braced herself for the blow . There was no thought of surrender , regardless of what the odds might be . Machine guns were mounted by the sea . Coastal areas were closed , barricades erected , tank traps installed . The great weakness , of course , was the lack of equipment . Nearly a thousand cannon had been lost in France . Tanks were few . There were not even enough rifles to go around . The outlook was n't very bright in Britain that summer , and we who were privileged to be there felt like mourners at the bier of a friend . I met Vincent Sheean one evening in Berkeley Square . " What chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hear the reply . " Less than 50 percent , " he said , lugubriously . Some set the odds much lower . The Germans massed for the kill . But something happened . The kill did n't come off . The German guns were answered , shell for shell . The invasion barges were dispersed . The Luftwaffe was sent scuttling back to its lair . Britain stood . It was no accident that Hitler failed to take the British Isles . He tried hard enough . He failed because he underestimated the British will to resist and the British capacity to take punishment . Above all , he failed because he underestimated the scope of the British war effort . Hitler is not the only one to err in the latter regard . Again and again , since returning to America , I have been surprised at the lack of understanding here concerning the resources of Britain and the manner in which those resources have been massed to build up the country 's military strength . This , in my opinion , is one of the great stories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salient facts is the purpose of this narrative . Modest R.A.F. Beat Vaunted Luftwaffe One explanation for our failure to grasp the magnitude of Britain 's war effort is the British habit of understatement . The Luftwaffe was publicized to the point where it was generally regarded as invincible . We heard very little about the Royal Air Force ; yet , when the showdown came , it was the R.A.F. which came out on top . I saw thirty or forty air battles in Great Britain . I never saw one in which the R.A.F. boys were n't tearing the Nazis to pieces . The simple fact is that the Nazis are n't nearly so good as they said they were , while the British are a whale of a lot better . Another explanation for our lack of understanding stems from the emphasis placed " life as usual " during the blitz . In an effort to minimize the effect of German bombs , the British ? and their friends awell ? got into the habit of portraying a country where everything went on as before , including activities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that everyone is working hard , and  | that soldiers , sailors , and airmen are at their posts , does not make much of a story . It is much more romantic to picture lovers strolling in the bomb-bruised night , and London cabbies threading scenes of devastation and death to deliver a dinner guest . It is human nature to thrill to such tales , but unfortunately in so doing we miss the real story the fact that Britain , even under fire , was forging the greatest military machine in the history of the Empire and one of the mightiest striking forces in battle history . Some nations are strong in the air , some on the sea , some on the land . Britain manages to be strong in all three branches . The United States may displace her in the air , on the sea , and on the land , but I do not believe that it is any exaggeration to rate Britain , as of June 1 , 1942 , as the greatest all-round military force on earth . The Colonies and Dominions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bulk of this incredible job has been done by a little country with a third the population of the United States , a fourth of the industrial capacity , and about a thirty-third of the area . The  | all-out assault of the Axis enemy has been met by an all-out response . The foundation upon which the British war effort rests is a simple obligation known as National Service . Everybody in Britain is expected to contribute to the common cause . Nelson 's famous dictum , " England expects every man to do his duty , " has been enlarged to include women and children ( pages 145 , 152 , 154 , 156 , 160 , 162 , 166 ) . The National Service Act decrees that " All persons of either sex for the time being in Great Britain are liable to national service , whether under the Crown or not , and whether in the armed forces of the Crown , in civil defense , in industry , or otherwise . " Nine million men are registered for service in the armed forces or employed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching . Every two weeks a new age group is called upon to register . Men are liable for military service between the ages of 18% and 51 . So many men have been taken into the Army that there has been a clamor for the release of coal miners , agricultural workers , and others considered necessary to keep up production of munitions and food . The military has yielded little . Women Help with Antiaircraft Guns More than five million women have registered for work in the uniformed services , in civil defense , in armament factories , or in some other branch of the war effort . Like men , women are liable to compulsory service up to the age of 51 , although only unmarried women between 20 and 30 are now being recruited . Married women between those ages may volunteer ( pages 162 , 163 ) . Women even serve with combatant units ? with antiaircraft batteries , for example but such service is voluntary . The three branches of military service ? air , sea , and land -- all have women 's auxiliaries . Women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done much to release men for combatant service. * Married women who possibly can do so are expected to serve in one of the auxiliaries , in civil defense , or in industry . Wives with husbands in the armed forces , or women required at home , are not asked to work in another part of the country . Moreover , no woman with a child under 14 living with her is expected to work away from home . Outside of these exceptions , and a few others , the women of England , like the men , are expected to do their part . The children are also registering for National Service . A million and a half boys and girls from 16 to 18 years old have signed up . That puts everyone from 16 to 51 in the front line of the fight against Hitler . The British system of National Service , if applied to the United States , would result in the enrollment of 60,000,000 persons . R.A.F. Turns from Defense to Attack The exploits of the R.A.F. are by now a familiar saga . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time when they might well have overrun the British Isles and those remaining portions of western Europe still undespoiled by virtue of the existence of a free Britain . The achievements of the R.A.F. came as a thrilling surprise to many of us who were abroad at the time ; we had heard so many stories of the size of the German Air Force , of the Reich 's great research facilities , and the superiority of Nazi planes . The first inkling we had that the R.A.F. might be able to take care of itself came during the evacuation from Dunkirk , when the British put an umbrella of planes over the French coast and kept it there for three days while some 335,000 men were saved from death or capture . Later I met a plane builder who did not seem to be at all worried about the prospects in the air , and still later I talked with an airman who said : " We have air superiority over these islands . Eventually we shall gain air superiority over the Continent . That will be the beginning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Battle of Britain . The airman 's assertion proved to be true . The Germans were never able to gain mastery over more than a fringe of British coast and they were soon forced to relinquish that . When they lost 185 planes in a single day , they stopped coming in the daytime . For eight months they came over at night , but eventually they decided that these raids , too , were not worth the expense of putting them on . The British concentrated on fighting quality rather than quantity in the production of planes . There is no doubt that Great Britain is first in the air . The R.A.F. may or may not be the biggest air force in the world , but it is certainly the strongest . Eventually the United States , with its larger population and superior industrial capacity , should rule the skies . As this is written , Britain enjoys that distinction .  | From the beginning of the war to date , the British and Dominion and Allied squadrons operating with them ? have brought down 10,000 German and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The most deadly months for the Axis were August and September of 1940 , when some 2,400 planes were lost over Britain compared to less than 800 lost by the R.A.F. The British were knocking them down so fast during the summer and fall of 1940 that people began to joke about which was the greater menace , falling bombs or falling bombers ! A year ago the people of Britain were cleaning up the wreckage caused by German bombers . Today bombers are going in the other direction . More than a thousand planes in a single night now roar over Germany and the occupied areas , strewing countless incendiaries and dropping high-explosive bombs of a size and destructiveness never before achieved . Raids are planned with the cooperation of the Ministry of Economic Warfare to insure maximum destruction of plants and supplies necessary to the enemy war effort . Railway centers come in for special attention . The British deny any intention to punish the civilian population , but one would have to be extremely naive to deny that civilian casualties are bound to result from such raids . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon such German war industry and supply centers as Lubeck , Rostock , Cologne , and Essen , tremendous " airmadas " gave the Nazis a bitter taste of the pulverizing power of the R.A.F. Thundering night assaults completely knocked out the Baltic war-supply ports of Lubeck and Rostock . Then came the attack on Cologne by more than a thousand planes , featuring Britain 's mighty four-engined bombers . In 90 minutes on the night of May 30 eight square miles of Cologne were laid waste , with armament and engine factories smashed or burned . Essen , site of the huge Krupp armament works , soon was hit almost as hard as Cologne . The R.A.F. is aided in its work , both offense and defense , by the Fleet Air Arm . Many nations are represented in the R.A.F. , especially the occupied nations , such as the Netherlands , Poland , Belgium , Norway . Thousands of men are now becoming available through the Empire Training Scheme , which is for men of the British Dominions . The additional thousands being trained in the United States are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Britain and plenty of space in the United States . Americans now as a rule join the U. S. Army Air Forces . The backbone of British defense has hitherto been the Royal Navy . If we accept Admiral Mahan 's classic hypothesis that seapower consists of fighting ships plus merchant vessels plus bases , then Britain is first at sea . We may outbuild her in merchant ships from now on , but at this point the British merchant marine is equal to that of the rest of the free world put together . Britain has bases everywhere . At the outbreak of war , the Royal Navy included 15 battleships , seven aircraft carriers . 58 cruisers , 205 destroyers , and 57 submarines . Many ships have been lost , of course , including such famous vessels as the Hood , Repulse. and the new Prince of Wales . British shipyards , however , have turned out a substantial amount of new tonnage , and 50 overage destroyers were secured from the United States . As a result , the Navy today is stronger than it was at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Royal Navy are colossal . The Admiralty 's primary responsibility , of course , is to prevent a sea-borne invasion of the homeland . The Navy must also maintain communications with the rest of the Empire and with military outposts wherever they may be , and ensure the delivery of foodstuffs and war materials necessary for a munitions output nearly as great as our own . Convoying of merchant vessels puts a terrible strain on the Navy . German submarineare much more numerous than in the last war and are able to operate from vastly superior bases . The British , meanwhile , are deprived of the use of bases in southern Eire . The Navy , finally , must keep close watch on the German Fleet to make sure that it does not escape into the Atlantic and do irreparable damage to convoys taking munitions to the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union . In keeping with the best traditions of the Royal Navy , commanders have never hesitated to attack and on occasion have defeated superior forces . The famed encounter between the German pocket battleship Graf Spec and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point . The Graf Spee was theoretically safe from the cruisers which forced her to end her career . Epic of " H.M.S. Pepperpot " /h How the British tar keeps his sense of humor in the face of danger and death is well illustrated by the story of the 5,270-ton cruiser Penelope . Drydocked at Malta with a bad hole in her side , she fought off repeated air attacks but was so heavily sprayed  | with shrapnel that four men were killed and fifty wounded . Because her plates were now riddled with a thousand holes , the Penelope 's men dubbed her " H.M.S. Pepperpot . " When they stopped the holes with wooden plugs , they took to calling her " H.M.S. Porcupine . " The ship 's guns were nearly worn out and the captain had " picked up a bit of a splinter , " but he put to sea , anyway , and the crippled cruiser dodged heavy bomb attacks to reach Gibraltar . She crossed the Atlantic " quite uneventfully " for repairs in the United States , and there reporters pried from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Side by side with the Royal Navy go the vessels of the Merchant Navy . British shipping has suffered grievously in this war as in the last . Hundreds of ships have been sent to the bottom and thousands of sailors have lost their lives . It takes a special kind of courage to go to sea today . Death by drowning or by torpedo blast is about the best fate to which a seaman may look forward . The experiences of men in lifeboats have become so commonplace that many are hardly reported in the newspapers ; yet some of them make the epic of Bligh of the Bounty look like a Sunday-school picnic . There are men who have spent a month in a lifeboat in the North Atlantic in the middle of winter . Literally hundreds have died in a sea of blazing oil . A shipping friend recently offered me an opportunity to cross on one of his freighters . I asked him what cargo the ship was carrying . He said she had on board , among other things , 600 tons of dynamite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addition to naval vessels , have also been pushing ahead with all possible speed on the construction of merchant ships . Even bombs do not silence the roar of the riveters . Work goes on day and night , and it now appears that , with the aid of America 's huge building program , British seapower will once more be able to weather the strain of a major conflict . Army of 2,250,000 , Plus Home Guard Britain has never gone in for a large standing army . One reason is the fear dating from  | Oliver Cromwell that a large army might be used for the suppression of civil liberties . This feeling also finds expression in the adverse British attitude toward creation of a special officer class . The British Army , with the possible exception of the Russian , is by far the most democratic in Europe . A large proportion of its officers , including its generals , have , for a century past , risen from the ranks . Today every officer must pass through the ranks . Another reason for the lack of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense of the country for centuries was entrusted to the Navy and during recent years has been split between the Navy and the R.A.F. About one half the Army at any time is employed on garrison service abroad . The Regular Army consisted of approximately 250,000 men in time of peace . Today it embraces 2,250,000 , to which must be added some 1,750,000 members of the Home Guard . The Home Guard is a unique force . It sprang into being in May , 1940 , when operations of Nazi parachute troops in France , Norway , Belgium , and the Netherlands made the British realize their own danger from such attacks . After the fall of France , when everyone expected that the Germans would immediately try to invade the British Isles , the force increased enormously . The men of Britain just seized whatever weapons they could get their hands on and went into the fields to watch for parachutists . Those who could not get rifles used shotguns ; those who could not get shotguns used pitchforks : those who could not get pitchforks used clubs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years of age officially . Actually , I have seen boys under 17 in the fields , and many below that age are now enrolled in a cadet force and other juvenile organizations . As for the older men , many a village patriarch who can not remember when he was 65 is pre- pared to resist invaders with whatever weapon may come to hand . Since December , 1941 , membership in the Home Guard has been compulsory for men between 18 and 51 not called for the Army ( page 161 ) . Every effort is made , however , to preserve its volunteer character . Members of the Home Guard serve in their spare time and without pay . They patrol roads , guard strategic points , and meanwhile prepare to impede the enemy in every possible way . They have received special training in guerrilla warfare , and if an enemy should succeed in setting foot on the soil of Britain he would find himself opposed by thousands of guerrillas skilled in the art of individual combat and animated by a fierce determination to die rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their islands is a fanaticism with the British . It has been in their blood for a thousand years , and it is a factor which prospective invaders would do well not to ignore . Invasion Plans Smashed by R.A.F. There has been much speculation as to whether or not the Germans actually attempted to invade England in the summer of 1940 . To us in London the first intimation that something was afoot came when a group of German prisoners passed through . We were used to seeing German airmen in the railway stations . These men , however , were not airmen ; they were infantrymen , and immediately the country began to seethe with rumors that the Germans had attempted an invasion and had been repulsed with heavy losses . The British have never settled the matter officially . The only evidence I encountered of an attempted invasion was the report of a friend on the southeast coast who said that splintered barges and some bodies were being washed ashore . Hotelkeepers in the vicinity were said to have secured enough wood for the winter from the barge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian Science Monitor , later told me he had seen trainloads of wounded soldiers passing through Berlin at the time of the rumored invasion attempt . William Shirer , in Berlin Diary , mentions these same trains . My personal opinion , verified unofficially by a British military man , is that the Germans were all set to invade , but that the R.A.F. succeeded in smashing up the invasion fleet before it was able to get under way . The British Army is the third strongest in existence . The great land powers of the moment are Germany and the Soviet Union . The question of which is the greater is now being resolved . On the land , as on the sea and in the air , the United States is growing rapidly in power . But today Britain is supreme , after Germany and Russia . The British , realizing that with their limited population they can not hope to compete with Germany on a quantity basis , are attempting to train a force of unexcelled striking power . Churchill describes his men as " hardened , nimble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen them in action , this is another understatement . The men are getting the hardest kind of battle training ( page 157 ) . Commando Raids a Prelude to Invasion Specially trained to raid the enemy coast are the famed Commandos . These tough troopers , under the brilliant leadership of Lord Louis Mountbatten , have made daring raids into enemy territory and no doubt will make many more ( page 143 ) . An individual Commando raid may not be important , but this type of warfare has great possibilities for confusing and harassing the enemy . English raids were highly successful in the Napoleonic Wars , and they have begun auspiciously in this war . The enemy never knows where the Commandos will strike next , and he never knows when a raid may develop into an invasion . When the United Nations invade as they eventually will ? the disconcerting attacks of the Commandos undoubtedly will play an important part in the operation . Much has been said and written , but little is actually known about the Commandos . The men must be good physical specimens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they must be extremely resourceful . They have some unique weapons , including a combination knif eknuckle duster which is said to be very useful at close quarters . One of the most spectacular Commando attacks was the raid on St. Nazaire on March 28 of this year . The objective was destruction of a lock gate in the harbor . A former American destroyer , the U.S.S. Buchanan , renamed the Campbeltown , was rammed into the gate and exploded . Landing in the face of enemy fire is one of the most difficult of all military operations . The fact that Hitler could n't do it when he had everything on his side shows what the United Nations are going to be up against when it is their turn to invade .  | The defeats suffered by Britain thus far in the war have led some to question her ability ever to challenge Germany on land . There are two explanations for these defeats : One is the fact that such landings as the one in Greece were lost causes from the beginning , undertaken only as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be disregarded . A second explanation involves what must inevitably be the pattern of Britain 's land strategy until she gets substantial assistance from her allies ? the hit-and-run attack as distinguished from pitched battles in the classic sense . Britain has neither the arms nor the men to slug it out with Germany . She must pursue a different kind of strategy , one that will permit her to make use of her overwhelming superiority in sea power and her developing superiority in air power . Britain , with Germany , is like a pack of dogs harrying a bull . The bull is stronger than any one of the dogs , and he can break out of the ring at will . He ca n't escape . though , and eventually the dogs bring him down . The R.A.F. , the Royal Navy , and the armies of the British Commonwealth are the dog pack which has been harassing the Nazi bull for nearly three years . With the Russians holding the front on the east , and with our help on the other sides , the pack eventually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an end . Britain 's " Fourth Arm " ? Civilian Defense The development of aerial warfare has brought into being a new type of service ? Civilian Defense . Civilian Defense is known in Britain as the " Fourth Arm . " During a period when the Army was immobilized because of its inability to get at the enemy , the  | Fourth Arm held the fort and by so doing probably saved the day for all of us . In their methodical , unspectacular way , the British laid the foundation for an excellent service prior to the outbreak of war . I remember vividly the day war was declared . The siren sounded 15 minutes after Prime Minister Chamberlain told the Nation that a state of war existed with Germany . Instantly , as if by magic , air-raid wardens appeared in the streets . People were quickly shepherded into places of shelter . The fire houses were thrown open and little gray pumps drawn by taxicabs went scooting about the city . Civil defense was very much on the job . It has remained on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large share of the credit for enabling Britain to resist the fury of Nazi bombs . A rigid blackout has been enforced since the first night of the war . Buildings have been sandbagged . Thousands of persons ? principally old people and children have been evacuated to places of safety in the country . The British have paid a great deal of attention to gas . The entire population has been supplied with gas masks and is constantly exhorted to carry them . The greatest hazard with which the British have had to contend is fire . There were 6,000 firemen in England at the beginning of the war . Almost overnight the service was expanded to include 80,000 full-time firemen and 150,000 part-time firemen . Hundreds of thousands of fire watchers , in addition , were recruited . The Germans probably dropped as many as 100,000 incendiary bombs on British cities in a single night . That British cities still stand is a tribute to the work of the National Fire Service . The Medical Services have also been drastically expanded . The British were prepared to handle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Casualties were never that high , but there were times when medical facilities were stretched to the breaking point . The ambulances are driven by women , usually mere slips of girls , and they function with the utmost precision regardless of what is coming down from the skies . The social services , already before the war probably the most advanced in the world , likewise have skyrocketed in scope . Scores of new services have been evolved to look after evacuees , to take care of bombed-out people , to feed men whose families have been sent to the country , to maintain the Nation 's health . These services have contributed mightily to the well-being of wartime Britain . They have helped to maintain morale , and it is no doubt partly because of their efforts that the Nation 's health is in many respects actually better than it was in time of peace . There are innumerable other branches of the civil defense services ? the squads who demolish wrecked buildings , the men who dig out trapped victims , the emergency-repair squads , the camouflage experts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so on . The repair squads are an interesting feature of the air-raid setup . There are hundreds of these squads in British cities . Each unit is complete with carpenters , bricklayers , electricians , plumbers , glaziers , roofers , and their helpers . They are on the job almost before the last enemy plane has disappeared , and emergency repairs on damaged properties often are finished by the time the occupants sit down to breakfast . German Planes Yield Tons of Scrap Salvage is another important activity . Everything that possibly can be used in the war effort is collected rags , bones , metal , paper , rubber . Crashed British planes are repaired so that they may fly again . German planes , shot down in the Battle of Britain , have contributed miles of wire and many tons of alloys and steel to British industry ( p. 164 ) . Lord Beaverbrook told the people last October that if they would turn in 100,000 tons of waste paper , he could divert 25,000 tons of shipping to the carriage of war supplies to Russia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal papers and secret documents . In the first two years of the war the amount of waste paper salvaged exceeded 500,000 tons , and the amount of scrap metal was approximately the same . Even the minute round disks of paper produced in the perforating of postage stamps have been salvaged to the extent of some scores of tons . Railway lines , streetcar lines , barges , old boatbuilding yards , and abandoned factories are providing a good source of metal . Printing shops are scoured for type and old plates . Even blitzed buildings are made to yield their quota of salvaged material . Four million dollars ' worth of material has come from debris during the past year . Bricks are used for building shelters , emergency water tanks , and the like . The R.A.F. uses large quantities for runways . Even the valueless rubble is made to serve , principally as fill for low areas or for ballast in ships sailing to America and  | ultimately to make road surfaces in New York City . Swords , Armor , Love Letters Salvaged As part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being torn down ( page 146 ) . Only those of definite historical interest , or those required for safety , are being spared . Old castles are being denuded of swords , pikes , and suits of armor . The extent of the salvage effort is indicated by a letter received at the Salvage Office of the London , Midland , and Scottish Railway . The letter was accompanied by a key . The sender wrote : " The house belonging to this key has been bombed . Please accept for salvage . " There is also the story of an old lady who was worried about her love letters . " If I bring in a lot of old letters , " she asked , " will anyone read them ? " The attendant at the salvage station assured her that the letters would not be read , but suggested that if it would add to her peace of mind she could tear them into small pieces . " Perhaps I will , " said the old lady , " but if I ca n't part with them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Intensive bombing of Britain ended in May . 1941 . Since then there have been only sporadic raids . If the Luftwaffe comes back in force , as it may well do , the civil defense workers of Britain are ready to meet ? and to take ? whatever the Germans have to offer . Seven miles of ambulance trains were drawn up outside British cities at the height of the blitz . They are still there . War on the Factory Front This is a mechanical war , and victory will probably be decided by our ability to produce goods . Here , as in the creation of armed forces and as in civilian defense , the British have done a remarkable job . Most of us tend to underestimate the industrial capacity of Britain . We forget that Britain normally produces more ships than the rest of the world put together , that she has a great metallurgical industry , that she is an exporter of locomotives and mining machinery , and that many of the world 's great dams and bridges have , been built by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power . This is where Britain really shines . In marine engines , of course , she is pre-eminent . In the manufacture of automobile engines , she is surpassed only by the United States . The performance of British aircraft engines is a topic of conversation wherever airmen gather . It is , I think , a significant fact that our new Warhawk plane is to be powered by a RollsRoyce engine , made by Packard . The British were slow in converting their factories after the outbreak of war . Apparently they were proceeding on the assumption that this war would follow the pattern of the last and that there was no need for haste . The arrival of German troops on the Channel changed all that . British industry was rapidly converted to war purposes and today is running full blast in the production of munitions . The Government starts with the assumption that machine tools must be employed 168 hours a week wherever possible . Manufacture of luxuries has virtually ceased , and manufacture for export is permitted only where it is required to meet the needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchange . The automobile industry has been converted 100 percent to war production . So has the radio industry . Old plants have been modernized and new plants constructed in every section of the country , principally with public funds . Operation is by private management . Manufacturers are allowed to make a small profit which , however , the Government retains until after the war , when it will be utilized for reconverting the business to peace requirements . There have been some cases of profiteering , but these are being stamped out . Raw materials are rationed to make sure that they are utilized in the production of essentials . Up to now , Great Britain has been the principal source of supply for the war against the Axis , although American production is now passing that of Great Britain and will soon be the dominant factor in the war . Plane and Tank Production Soars British arms production today is three times that achieved in the spurt after Dunkirk and ten times what it was at the outbreak of war . Production has increased 40 percent in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and National Service , talks grimly of running ; t up another 40 percent during the coming winter .  | Britain has secured much help from the United States . She has also sent much help abroad . Lord Halifax recently pointed out that , whereas Britain received from us some 2,000 planes in 1941 , she sent abroad approximately 9,000 planes . The ratio for tanks was 200 to 3,000 . Eighty percent of the output of British factories is now being shipped to Russia , the Middle East , and the various other theaters of war . Tank production has increased fivefold since 1940 and twofold since August of last year . Lord Beaverbrook recently revealed that output of two-pounder guns has reached a rate of 30,000 a year . Naval ships are being produced almost four times as rapidly as in the last quarter before the outbreak of war . The rate for merchant tonnage , meanwhile , has doubled . These figures are the more remarkable when it is remembered that British industry was for many months subjected to nightly attacks from the air . Production fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but has increased steadily ever since . Partly as a protection against bombing and partly to spread the work , the manufacture of armaments has been greatly decentralized . A certain tank consisting of 8,000 parts is being manufactured by 6,000 firms . The firms range from big plants to backyard garages . An All-out Conversion Program Every conceivable kind of conversion has been carried out . During the last six months more than 4,000 factories have been shifted to new work . Torpedoes are now being produced in a plant that formerly made boots and shoes ; air engine parts are being made in a hairpin factory ; a manufacturer of tops is now producing airplane parts . Small business is handling a large share of British production . There are about 100,000 firms in Great Britain employing fewer than 25 workers each . The majority of them are now working on war contracts . Small or large , the firms of Britain have rallied to the war effort and , despite blackouts and bombs , are producing goods at a rate never achieved in time of peace . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million acres of new land have been brought into cultivation . This means that the total area under crops is now nearly 50 percent above peacetime figures ( pp. 152 , 154 ) . Land which has not produced since the days of the Spanish Armada is being put under the plow . About three-fourths of the new la id has been planted in cereal grains . Swamps have been reclaimed . Golf courses . sports grounds , city lots , and cemetery extensions are being made to yield food . Famous gardens , once noted for their fragrance , are now given over to cabbages . Britain , in her third year of war , is bringing in the biggest harvest of the century . Non-farmers do their bit to augment the Nation 's food supply . R.A.F. pilots grow radishes beside their machines . Chickens cluck in the fashionable squares of London . A million bees have been turned loose in the heather of Camberley forest . Potatoes are flourishing at Hampton Court and at Sandringham . A field of flax which was planted experimentally by King George V @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crops ? men . women , old people , children . Soldiers are sent to work in the fields . Twenty thousand women have enrolled in the Women 's Land Army . Ten thousand schoolboys have been recruited to help . Flower gardens have been turned into vegetable gardens , of which there are now about three million . Villagers ' and work peoples allotments number nearly two million . About sixty million dollars ' value of vegetables is thus produced by individuals , and land to that extent is released for production of grain . Scientific research has been directed to such matters as means for increasing the number of multiple births of calves so as to aid beef production . A hundred thousand tractors have been mobilized , compared to 5,000 in the last war . They are manned nonstop , in shifts , to make sure that they are always busy . Four thousand schoolboys over 16 have been trained to relieve the regular drivers . Britain is now the most highly mechanized farming country in Europe . The reason for growing food in Britain is to relieve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be brought from abroad . The German submarine warfare makes this expensive and perilous . Robert S. Hudson , Minister of Agriculture , declares that a five percent increase in farm production will save 1,500,000 tons of shipping . Britons fully realize the importance of shipping . They are making their ancient acres produce as never before . Labor Knows Unions ' Fate under Axis Most of the credit for the miracles of production now being achieved in Britain , both in the factory and on the farm , rightfully belongs to labor . The working people of Britain realize that an Axis victory would  | mean the enslavement of workers everywhere , and they have given unstintingly o f time and effort to make sure that this terrible contingency does not come to pass . British labor relations today revolve about a revolutionary piece of legislation known as the Essential Work Order . This measure was inspired by labor itself to make sure that every worker was permitted to make the maximum contribution to the war effort ? and , conversely , to make sure that the worker took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Order guarantees a minimum weekly wage to workers in essential industries and protects them against dismissal . At the same time , the Order prevents the stoppage of work by the workers . In case of dispute , both parties have recourse to special arbitration tribunals . The Order does not freeze either wages or hours . It is , in its simplest form , a device to make sure that industry , on one hand , provides work and that labor , on the other hand , gets the work done . Although the Essential Work Order contains plenty of teeth , compliance has been largely voluntary . Industry has been promised that wartime restrictions will be removed the moment victory is achieved , and labor is assured , by unanimous vote of Parliament , of the restoration of every right and privilege it has relinquished for the sake of the war effort . Britain is the most highly unionized of the great powers . The unions today have more members than at any period in their history ? well over 7,000,000 . If American workers were to organize to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Industrial Organization and the American Federation of Labor would have upwards of 20,000,000 members instead of the 10,000,000 they do have . As a result of the patriotic attitude of British workers , work stoppages have been infinitesimal in this war . There has not been a strike of any consequence in two years . Government officials declare that time lost through labor disputes represents only one day per man each 15 years , or an average of seven seconds a day . In view of the many harassments to which the workers have been subjected ? long hours , rationing , the blackout , travel difficulties , to  | mention a few the achievements of British labor constitute one of the brightest pages being written by Britain in World War II . Britons Work 60- or 65-hour Week Hours of work in Britain have been incredibly long . In the period following Dunkirk , the workers drove themselves 75 and 80 hours a week . Production shot up and the country was saved . Eventually , however , the country found itself in the position of the man who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just when he got the thing settled the horse died . British workers got up to 80 hours a week , but from there on production , instead of increasing , declined . The Government had to call a halt . Hours have now been reduced to an average of 60 to 65 hours for men and 55 to 60 for women . Beyond that , according to the Industrial Health Research Board , there is damage to health , loss of interest , and ? eventually if not immediately ? an actual decrease in output . Wage rates and total earnings have increased considerably during the war . However , the cost of living has gone up more than wages . Skilled workers in certain occupations no doubt have bettered their position , but the workers as a whole have had to accept a reduction in their standard of living , since prices have risen by 30 percent compared to a 27 percent rise in wages . The Government 's policy now is to prevent any further increase in living costs and thus avoid the need of additional wage increases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1939 , to less than 200,000 today . The unemployed are about equally divided between men and women . They consist almost exclusively of unemployables and persons in transition from one job to another . Half of Aircraft Workers Are Women Women have taken their place beside men in the British war effort . A million and a half women are working in the munitions factories and other vital industries . Their number is being increased , as this is written , at the rate of 5,000 a day . Half the workers in aircraft factories are women . Eventually the proportionwill reach 70 percent ( page 145 ) .  | Britain 's women are also repairing automobiles , unloading ships , sweeping chimneys , laying telephone lines , delivering mail . A hundred thousand have transport jobs , including 40,000 on the railways . They carry baggage , collect tickets , and operate signals . Nearly 1,200 are serving as bus conductors in the London area alone . The authorities have begun to worry about what to do with all of these women after the war , since a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working . Many girls are now studying and training in their spare time for definite jobs useful in the postwar world . Important social changes are bound to occur in Britain as a result of the wholesale induction of women into industry . The word " male " in British statutes has been construed to include women unless they are specifically exempted . This is only one small indication of the important part played by women in the British war effort and the equally important part they are destined to play in the peace . The boys and girls of Britain , no less than their parents , have been mobilized for victory . A national youth movement was inaugurated at the beginning of the war . Organizations such as the Boy Scouts and the Girl Guides are fully mobilized . Young people who do not belong to any organization are invited to join the Youth Service Corps , whose members do about 80 different kinds of jobs . Among them are painting curbstones to aid drivers in the blackout , digging gun and searchlight emplacements , carrying messages in air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Britain 's Toll in Blood and Tears The all-out war effort we have been discussing has not been achieved without a harrowing expenditure of blood and suffering . There is a miserable canard to the effect that Britain lets others do her fighting for her . The Nazis employ this canard on every possible occasion , and they change it to appeal to whatever country they happen to be " softening up " at the moment . According to Goebbels , Britain is always fighting to the " last Frenchman , " the " last Dutchman , " the " last Greek . " Now Britain is supposed to be fighting to the " last American . " We had a variant of this canard some  | years ago under the title , England Expects Every American to Do His Duty . I am happy to help spike this kind of propaganda . The British are not angels , nor are they supermen . They are subject to all the frailties and the limitations of others . There is one thing , however , that ca n't truthfully be said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do battle when it is necessary to do battle in defense of their country . A million Britons laid down their lives in the combined effort to win the last war . The British are prepared , if necessary , to do it again . Empire casualties for the first two years of the war , according to Clement R. Attlee , Deputy Prime Minister , aggregated 183,550 . Of these casualties , 48,973 were killed , 46,363 wounded , 58,458 taken prisoner , and 29,756 reported missing . Seventy out of every 100 men killed or wounded in land fighting have been British ; the others are accounted for by the Dominions , the Colonies , and India . The proportion of British casualties to the total for sea and air fighting is much higher ? perhaps as much as 90 percent . Capt . David Margesson , now Lord Margesson , when Secretary of War , told the House of Commons that nearly half the Allied troops in the Middle East came from Britain , that 46 percent of those in Crete came from Britain . and 33 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were sent to Norway . On the Western Front , United Kingdom troops were in the ratio of 70 to 1 in relation to the rest of the Empire . These figures are cited not to minimize the contribution of the Dominions and Colonies . which has been magnificent , but to show that Britain is pulling her weight in the great battle now under way to keep the world safe for the democratic way of life . The ravages of the Battle of Britain , it goes without saying , were borne more or less exclusively by the inhabitants of the islands . Some 43,000 men , women , and children have been killed to date in this ghastly encounter . More than fifty thousand have been seriously injured , many of them maimed for life . High Taxes and Short Rations There are a thousand bomb victims still lying in the hospitals of Britain , and 1,500 war orphans are available for adoption by the kind-hearted people of the world . Property losses of the war bomb damage .  | sunken ships , destroyed or captured installations , lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It takes money to win a war , and the British are spending money to the limit of the national exchequer . More money was spent in the first two and a half years of this war than in the four and a quarter years of the last war . Sixty-eight percent of the national income is being spent on the war , $17,000,000.000 out of an annual income of S25,000,000.000 . Hugh Dalton , President of the Board of Trade , describes Britain 's present system as " fortress economics . " Business goes through the motions of producing at a profit , and labor goes through the motions of working for wages , but the whole thing boils down to a kind of Spartan socialism under which employer and employee alike work for the State and are allowed to retain just enough of the necessities of life to enable them to keep going . It 's the same system used by the Axis , except that this one is voluntary and the producers hope to get rid of it , or at least to ameliorate it , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxation should take a look at Britain . Income taxes begin at $440 . A married man with two dependents and an income of $2.500 a year pays $12 a year in the United States . In Britain he pays $530 . The top rate here is 81 percent : there it is 97.5 percent . Indirect taxes have been heavily increased . Cigarettes cost 30 cents a pack , a fair cigar is 75 cents , gasoline 40 cents a gallon , automobile tax from $50 to $200 , according to size of car : and there is a " purchase tax " varying from 20 percent to 40 percent , according to the class of goods . With a 30 percent rise in the cost of living , Britons have had to tighten their belts to the limit to keep the war machine going . We in the United States are just beginning to experience shortages . Britain has been on short rations for two years . Britain is definitely beginning to look shabby . The people try to keep up appearances , to keep their cities clean and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materials just are n't available . Meanwhile , food is rigorously plain and scarce . The basic sugar ration is half a pound a week per person . The ration for fats is the same , for bacon or ham four ounces , jam four ounces , cheese three ounces , tea two ounces . The fat ration , which includes two ounces of butter a week , is about half the amount per person consumed here . Meat is rationed by price , each person being allowed 24 cents ' worth of meat per week . Milk is rigidly controlled . Expectant and nursing mothers , and children under five , are allowed a pint a day : others get two pints a week , plus one tin of canned milk a month and one tin of dried skimmed milk per family per month . Milk is supplied free to persons in the first group if the family income is below a certain figure . Eggs are like nuggets . The allotment is three a month , but few people are able to average more than two . Rationing Permits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about half the peacetime average . The British man this year gets enough coupons to buy a suit or overcoat , a pair of shoes , a sweater , a couple of shirts , some underwear , and several pairs of socks . The British woman is able to buy one dress , two pairs of shoes , two pairs of , gloves , eight handkerchiefs , nine pairs of hose , and a couple of pieces of underwear . The people of Britain have found that they can do without a lot of things formerly considered necessary to a halfway decent standard of living . Soap is also rationed , each person being allowed about a pound a month . Coal is allocated at a rate of roughly one ton a month . Motoring for pleasure has been abolished . The owner of a medium-sized car considered essential to the war effort is allowed about 12 gallons of gasoline a month . Shortages are rapidly becoming acute . " Please bring your own hairpins , " reads a sign over a hairdressing establishment in Great Yarmouth . Country housewives are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goldfish are starving for want of imported food . Bottles are standardized to save glass . Business executives use kitchen tables in lieu of desks . It is always difficult and sometimes impossible to get anything repaired . Three hundred thousand babies will have to do without new buggies this year . A War by , for , and of the People The British carry on . Their morale is incredible . Out of the thousands of persons I met in Britain , only one was willing to concede the possibility of defeat . They pan the Government and heckle speakers and vote unpopular candidates out of office . They growl at Churchill and Churchill growls back . They criticize the military and clamor loudly for a second front . A Nazi , planked down in their midst , would think that it was all over , that Hitler and Goering and Goebbels and Himmler had only to walk across the Channel and take charge .  | It 's a mistake that has been made before . These people take their democracy seriously . They insist on the exercise of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insist on the right to overthrow , through the exercise of the ballot , any government which does not prosecute the war to their satisfaction . They insist on having books with their bullets , and the stimulation of theaters and art galleries and concerts and lectures . They insist upon the right to go fishing or to walk in the fields or to travel about the country or to bet upon a horse race . They insist upon the preservation of the social services they have been erecting for the past century . They insist , finally , upon the right to worship as they please . There is one thing more : They insist that the sacrifices they are making , and will make , shall not be in vain . Britons in every walk of life envision a land where the lust for power is supplanted by the will to do good , where the evils of the factory system are cured , where the cruelties of the struggle for existence are assuaged , where the inequities of an archaic social system are removed . And the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ envision it as part of a world where nations are able to trade with one another and exchange people and spread culture and grow great without the periodical recourses to arms which have characterized world history up to now . The people of Britain have gone all-out to win the war . I think we may count on their co-operation in the even more difficult job of winning the peace .  |
