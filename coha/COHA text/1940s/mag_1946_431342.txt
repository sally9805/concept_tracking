H OW fast can man fly ? and live ? In the gulf between the 600-m.p.h. speed that is his physical limit today and the 3,000-m.p.h. velocity of the fastest flying machine ( V-2 ) he has devised lies the unexplored region of aeronautical science . Air Force and Navy scientists , assisted by researchers from many universities and laboratories , are rushing the development of safety equipment to keep man in step with the airplanes of tomorrow . Already under test are new flying suits , parachutes , automatic releases , deceleration straps , pressure cabins , and quick-exit devices ? all needed to overcome the extra dangers of supersonic speeds and ultrastratospheric altitudes . Wartime experience with 400-m.p.h. fighters gave forewarning of the difficulties to be expected in bailing out of high-speed , high-altitude aircraft . This important problem has been attacked at Wright Field , Ohio , by the design of an automatic threepiece escape set including a seat ejector that literally shoots the pilot clear of a plane , an aneroid parachute release , and the jerkless , nonswaying ribbon parachute . All are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulls the ejector trigger until he lands on the ground . The seat ejector was developed to meet a need that existed even with airplanes considered slow by present-day standards : pilots jumping from the cockpit did not fall fast enough to escape being hit by tail surfaces or other obstructions . With the new Air Force device , the flier and his seat are shot 60 feet straight up in one second . A second automatic explosion then disconnects the strap holding the man to the seat and opens a small parachute to pull the seat away , leaving the man to fall free . The propelling mechanism is a small  | 37-mm. gun mounted vertically in the cockpit behind the pilot . Instead of the usual projectile , a long tube , attached to the seat , fills the gun barrel . When the pilot pulls the trigger , near his right leg , the explosion of the 37-mm. shell expels tube , seat and pilot with almost instant acceleration to the 60-feet-per-second speed . This rapid acceleration would impose severe strain on the man , pushing him down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his normal weight ? much like the effect felt in an express elevator , but exaggerated hundreds of times . The harm this strain may cause , particularly to the spine , is still being investigated , although the first test with a human being was made without injury . Once clear of airplane and seat , the flier still faces a double hazard . He must drop quickly to an altitude low enough to give him sufficient air ? if he opens his parachute too soon he dies from anoxia ( lack of oxygen ) ; too late , he smashes into the ground . The aneroid parachute release eliminates both dangers by opening the ' chute automatically at a preset altitude . This new release is basically an aneroid barometer , which contracts with increasing atmospheric pressure . When the falling man reaches the predetermined altitude , the atmospheric pressure at that height causes the aneroid unit to contract and fire a small shell ? about the size of a 12-gauge cartridge ? which releases the rip cord . The aneroid unit can be set for a particular altitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air , so the pilot can change the setting to meet the conditions of his flight . An ordinary parachute , opened at extremely high speed and altitude , would jerk the flier hard enough to injure him or even rip the harness away . To prevent such accidents , a unique parachute made of interlaced ribbons is used . The ribbon parachute eliminates opening shock by permitting some of the air trapped under its lattice-like canopy to escape through the spaces between ribbons , so that the jumper slows down gradually to a safe rate of descent . This gradual deceleration also makes the ribbon parachute valuable for high-speed jumps at lower altitudes . It has been tested at velocities as high as 375 m.p.h. with good results . Even this new escape set will offer protection only up to 450 m.p.h. , reports Brig . Gen. Malcolm C. Grow , the Air Surgeon General . Tests indicate that the air pressure at higher speeds would be too great for the human body to withstand safely . For bailouts at extremely great velocities  | and altitudes , Gen. Grow predicts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which can be ejected with the flier inside . A parachute would be attached to the capsule itself . Another method of reducing opening shock in parachute leaps is being developed at the Research Institute of the Naval Medical Center , Bethesda , Md . Workers there , under the direction of Comdr . Howard R. Bierman , have designed a safety harness using a special undrawn nylon , which stretches inelastically ( without recoil ) to safeguard pilots in crashes . The harness could also be used to provide protection against most of the sudden jerk accompanying the opening of a standard parachute . Costing only a few dollars , the new harness has the advantage of economy over the ribbon ' chute , which is more than three times as expensive as the standard equipment . The undrawn nylon harness also promises protection against " ram effect , " or sudden deceleration , a danger which becomes vitally important at very high velocities . Engineers fear that , in the event of engine failure at supersonic speeds , air friction would slow the aircraft so sharply that passengers would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airplane had flown into the side of a mountain . The nylon harness might decelerate the occupants gradually enough to prevent harm . High speeds introduce another unusual danger : blackout , or loss of consciousness in fast turns . In this case , a partial solution was found in special flying suits , called G suits , early enough for them to see combat use . Blackout results from the tremendous centrifugal force acting on a pilot when he makes a tight turn at great velocities . This force pulls the blood downward from his brain , numbing it and causing temporary blindness or unconsciousness . Since the effect of centrifugal force on a pilot is similar to the action of gravity , it is usually measured in Gs , or the apparent increase of a man 's weight over his normal , gravitycaused weight ' , Thus , standing still on the ground a man feels 1 G , while in a 2-G turn his weight-seems to double , in a 3-G turn , triple , and so on .  | To keep the pilot 's blood up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Air Force and Navy researchers , aided by the Mayo Clinic of Rochester , Minn. , and the Berger Brothers Company , New Haven , Conn. , developed special suits containing air-filled bladders that press against the abdomen and thighs to prevent blood from draining away from the upper part of the body . The supply of compressed air to these bladders is regulated by an automatic valve , controlled by centrifugal force . As G increases , the valve admits additional air to the bladders , causing them to expand and press more tightly against the pilot 's body . Decreasing G lets air out of the bladders . The G suit adds about 2 G to the average person 's ability to withstand 5 to 6 G. Safe turns as great as 10 G have been reported , however , by P-80 pilots wearing the suit . Since the faster postwar airplanes will undoubtedly require turns of still higher G , better methods of surmounting this difficult . are being sought . Now in the design stage are prone cabins , in which the pilot lies flat on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled down from his brain , with a resulting increase in G tolerance . Invariably linked to greater speeds are higher altitudes , with the accompanying problems of oxygen supply and low pressure . Oxygen masks now in use furnish merely a partial solution . Pressure cabins , successfully employed in the B-29 , can make up only part of the difference between livable pressure and ultrastratospheric pressure because of the danger of explosive decompression ? sudden accidental loss of pressure that might seriously injure the occupants of the cabin . New pressure suits permitting complete freedom of movement are in work , but are not expected to be available for two years . The speed of sound ? only yesterday an ' apparently impassable limit ? seems sure to be exceeded very soon by piloted aircraft . The Navy has already driven its ram-jet engine to 1,500 m.p.h. , while the V-2 can reach 3,000 m , p.h . Now the No. 1 problem is no longer how fast man can fly , but how fast he can fly ? and live .  |       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
