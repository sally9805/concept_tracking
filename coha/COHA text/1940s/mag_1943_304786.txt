The author of Britain 's famed proposal for " cradle to grave " security through compulsory insurance kept his arrival secret for two days , finally emerged at a press conference in the sumptuous offices of the Rockefeller Foundation . <P> Did Sir William care to discuss the proposal for U.S. postwar relief and employment offered by the National Resources Planning Board ( TIME , March 22 ) -a document sometimes referred to as the American Beveridge Plan ? He did : <P> " A very remarkable and able document . . . but only in showing the facts of insecurity in the United States as an argument for doing something . I would say that the NRPB report is not so detailed , not so practical as mine . It is concerned with principles rather than with details . " <P> Sir William was plainly trying to spare the rod . He continued : " In England it would correspond to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Relief of Distress . But , of course , it is only natural that you in America would be 30 years late in discovering the spread of unemployment and poverty because your standard of living is so much better than ours . The NRPB report simply shows that unemployment and poverty exist . "
