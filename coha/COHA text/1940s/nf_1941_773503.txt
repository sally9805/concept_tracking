In one of these orchard districts there are outlets on the telephone poles into which the " riders " can plug portable telephones for calling the central office . When dangerous temperatures are expected , the Weather Bureau advises telephone officials how many extra operators will be needed and at about what time . All busy airports have leased teletype facilities for reports on sky and weather conditions , made at frequent intervals by the Department of Commerce . As part of its flood control work , the Weather Bureau makes use of robot river-stage reporters . These devices are installed at points where it is extremely difficult to obtain the services of a person to make and report eye-readings of the river stage , or at points where it is important to obtain frequent reports at all hours of the day and night . They consist of a " stilling well " with a float @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with varying signals as it rises and falls , and transmits them by telephone . When the number of any one of these instruments is dialed , telephonic connection is automatically made , and any listener may hear the buzzer signals , the timing of which indicates how high the water is . During a recent flood in the Susquehanna River , the stage was obtained each hour from the robot at Harrisburg , Pennsylvania , and the public was informed of the steps to be taken to protect life and property . Another branch of the Department of Agriculture to which the telephone is very important is the Forest Service . In forest fire control it plays a vital part , for , in this , speed of attack is absolutely essential . With rapidly spreading fires , if the suppression force is to arrive in time to prevent // enormous damage , not over fifteen minutes can be allowed for the functions of detection , report and get-away , after the fire starts . Lookouts are posted in high towers all through our forest regions , whose job it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sees a column rising , the lookout locates its direction from his observatory , in degrees and minutes , and telephones this information to the nearest ranger stations , where fire fighters are ready to rush out with the necessary equipment . ' Telephones are installed at regular intervals along the roads through forested areas with conspicuous signs reading , " Report fires here . " The Forest Service has more than a thousand portable short-wave radio sets for reporting the progress of fire fighters , and communicating their needs in localities where no telephones are available . The United States Coast Guard , which is a branch of the Treasury Department , reports through its public relations officer that " both the wire telephone and the radiotelephone are of inestimable value in maintaining official communication with many of the more important lighthouses and lightships . Telephones have , for years , also been a great comfort to the keepers , particularly at those lighthouses which are remotely located . " The public telephone with its succession of different users has been the subject of much attention and investigation on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ millions of telephones used each day for many more millions of conversations , however , has failed to produce an authenticated case of disease transmission by the use of the telephone . Companies have been formed to visit telephone stations and disinfect them for a monthly fee , and various devices and preparations designed to make tele82 THE TELEPHONE IN A CHANGING WORLD phones " antiseptic " or " sanitary " have been put on the market . Attempts have been made to agitate for legislation requiring the disinfection of phones , but because such measures were not at all necessary they have not received the support of the government agencies which guard our health . Two special studies were made of hundreds of public telephones in Chicago and New York , in the course of which bacteriologists wiped transmitter mouthpieces with moistened sterile swabs , and then made cultures from them to determine the kinds of bacteria present . In both studies , certain disease-causing bacteria were found on some instruments , but nearly ninety per cent of these were of varieties that would be dead within fifteen minutes after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resting place into a talker 's mouth . To the police forces of our nation , the telephone is a particularly indispensable adjunct . Constantly , citizens are urged to report to headquarters without delay , not only crimes which are witnessed but also suspicious-seeming persons or circumstances . " Phone the police , " posters say ; the faster a report gets in to headquarters , the faster the police department can swing into action , thus cutting down " escape time " and making arrest more probable . The forces themselves , of course , use the telephone , local and long distance , for both spreading and collecting information and giving orders . They warn departments in other communities to be on the lookout for a bank robber or a stolen car of such and such description . They call the Motor Vehicle Bureau to find out who is the owner of a certain license . They have even developed a system whereby they can identify fingerprints over the telephone . // The call box for " the cop on the beat , " which used to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part in the service , but with motorized criminals have come vastly improved communication facilities and techniques . The short-wave two-way radio and the teletypewriter , both telephone by-products , have revolutionized police practices . Within limited areas the two-way radios are proving to be of increasingly great value in keeping mobile police units , such as automobiles , in constant touch with headquarters , while over wide areas the teletypewriter with its printed record , its duplicate copies , its ability to receive messages at unattended stations , its secrecy and its power to communicate simultaneously with many points , offers additional features of very great value to law enforcement bodies . Traffic police also use the telephone and radio for advising week-end and holiday motorists of congested highways and alternate routes . The tapping of telephone wires as a means of obtaining incriminating evidence has been the subject of much lively discussion . Diabolically clever devices have been invented for this purpose , but the United States Supreme Court has outlawed the use of such evidence in Federal Courts under existing statutes . Better let a few criminals go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation subject to the possible abuses of official wire tapping . A number of bills have been introduced to legalize wire tapping by regular police , " G-Men , " Customs Officials , Coast Guards and Tax Collectors but so far none has been enacted . This does not mean , however , that the subject has been ignored by responsible authorities . The Federal Bureau of Investigation knows the science of wire tapping thoroughly , the Secret Service goes over the White House and its // grounds regularly for wire tapping devices ; the Signal Corps guards the secrecy of Army communications ; and the Navy Intelligence section , those of the Navy . When calls are made between high ranking officers of our State Department and the heads of other governments the full force of surveillance is always in play . On behalf of national defense in the present state of world affairs , however , Congress is likely to pass a bill to legalize wire tapping by the F.B.I. , where espionage is suspected . In related vein , telephone companies have been subjected to bitter criticism , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ providing illegitimate enterprises with telephone service . A recent Pennsylvania statute set a penalty of from one to three years ' imprisonment , or a fine of from one to five thousand dollars , on companies furnishing telephone wires or services for disseminating racing information . Telephone companies , in a way , welcome this sort of legislation because it simplifies their public relations . They are , of course , aware that a garage which orders a hundred private-wire phones installed on the second floor does not expect to derive its entire income from repairing and storing cars , but telephone companies generally are under duty to provide service without discrimination . According to the current rules of the game they can not pick and choose their customers , or censor the conversations that go over their wires . Until officially proven guilty , the " bookie 's " headquarters receive the same sort of telephone service as the stockbroker 's office . That is part of our American way . In May , 1916 , United States Navy officials made their first tests of telephoning to ships at sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at ArlingTHE // ton , Virginia , and the battleship , New Hampshire , fifty miles off the Virginia coast . Soon after the United States entered the war , in 1917 , Bell System engineers had also devised methods and apparatus for telephoning to airplanes in flight . The first successful two-way communication between a ground station and a plane in flight was established at Langley Field , Virginia , in August of that year . When short-wave radiotelephony was introduced , mobile services began to be developed on a commercial basis . The first of these was the ship-to-shore service initiated on the North Atlantic , in 1929 , by operation between the late S.S. Leviathan and transmitting and receiving stations in New Jersey . This made it possible for anyone to pick up a telephone in his home and , in just a few minutes , be speaking with someone aboard a liner in midocean ; or vice versa , for world travelers to keep in touch with home from wherever they might be . At one time as many as twenty-five liners , on both the Atlantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was discontinued on ships belonging to belligerents , there remain on the Shipto-Shore Operator 's call board only our own S.S. Washington , S.S. Manhattan and S.S. America in the Atlantic and the Kamakura Maru in the Pacific . Radiotelephone service is available , however , not only for luxury liners , but for the tugs and trawlers of our coastal waters as well . Today , more than two thousand different boats in the coastal and harbor waters of this country , as well as on the Great Lakes , can keep in touch with their headquarters or make a call to any telephone on shore . About half of these boats are yachts and pleasure craft and half are tugboats , barges , fishing-boats , steamships , ferryboats , pilot-boats , and other commercial vessels . // Every day , people aboard these boats discuss with other people ashore , by telephone , such commonplace but important matters as are illustrated by the following fragments , fictitious but typical : " Proceed to Pier 18 for immediate tow of barges A and B , which are loaded with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barges in an hour and have you enough coal aboard for a fifteen-mile trip ? " " Our engines have broken down one mile east of Execution Light . Can you send us a tow and also twenty feet of tube to repair fuel line ? " " Hello , Margaret . We had a pleasant trip and expect to land at the yacht club dock about seven o'clock . Please have a car at the dock to meet us . Will it be convenient to wait dinner for us ? " " Mr. Jones , this is your secretary speaking . We have advance information , that there will be considerable weakening in the market today and Mr. Smith has asked me to ascertain what action you wish taken . " " This is the trawler Mary . We have run into a large school of mackerel ten miles south-southeast of Montauk Point . Suggest you notify other company trawlers operating in this vicinity to proceed here . " Companies operating fleets of tugboats , lighters , barges or other vessels can use radiotelephone service to great advantage , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in operation , and help may be summoned when necessary . In this way they cut down on idle tug time and secure economy in operation . This is of vital importance to a towing company , for a more efficient use of tugs means a more profitable business , and fewer delays mean better service to the customer . // One of the yacht owners subscribing to this service , until he turned his yacht over to the Navy , was Major Edward Bowes of " amateur hour " fame . Not so long ago a sudden squall resulted in the crushing of one of the Major 's fingers , by the closing of a heavy door aboard the yacht . The Major used his radiotelephone to call the switchboard operator at the Capitol Theatre in New York , asking her to have his chauffeur and doctor ready at the dock when he arrived . To the thousands of Americans , especially in New England and Alaska , who depend upon fishing for their livelihood the radiotelephone has been a special boon . It means that the captain of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fish Pier office , discussing his catch , market prices and conditions of crew and weather , before deciding to rush in with what he has , or stay out a few days longer . In Alaskan waters , not so much the fishing-boats themselves , but the tenders , which cover widely scattered sections collecting the daily catches of salmon from the fishing-boats , are equipped with radiotelephones . These keep in touch with their cannery superintendent at all times , and their movements are directed by him so that the supply of fish for the cannery is regular and continuous , and the approximate size of the day 's catch is known , and prepared for at the cannery , before it arrives there . The fact that radiotelephoning can be done by a person doing something else at the same time , and does not require a trained operator , makes it particularly adaptable for fliers . The Department of Commerce maintains a radiotelephone service for broadcasting to pilots , at scheduled intervals every hour or so , information concerning existing weather // conditions and forecasts for both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two-way communication is maintained during flight , so that pilots may report their positions directly to dispatchers , and ask for supplementary data on local ceiling heights and conditions in the upper air strata . Most large air liners have , in addition to their facilities for two-way voice communication with landing fields , a little telephone system connecting the pilot , co-pilot , flight engineer and stewardess , so that they need not run back and forth and shout to each other . When the ship lands at an airport , these phones may be plugged into the nation-wide wire network and passengers may make calls to any place desired . New York City now has a police force in the air as well as on land and water . This newly organized arm of the law consists of two high-powered planes , one a land plane and the other a seaplane , both radiotelephone equipped . By their two-way radio voice links , the planes while aloft may keep in close touch with all other divisions of the department . They may talk directly with the two-way radio patrol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patrol boats covering the waters about the city . These sky police are particularly useful in automobile traffic control , and searches for wrecks or persons afloat in need of aid . Their planes are designed for conversion to ambulance use , and may also be used in aerial photographic work for the city 's law-enforcing agencies . Mayor La Guardia of New York City has even his own car equipped with a two-way radiotelephone . En route to the City Hall , he can pick it up and announce , " This is Car N Y C , the Mayor speaking . Connect me with CornTHE // missioner So-and-So of San Francisco , " and soon he 'll be talking with that official . Before the war , a nation-wide audience listened in and heard the Mayor , while driving through Central Park , use his new telephone for a chat with the Lord Mayor of London , riding in his horse-drawn coach . This N.B.C . broadcast was made possible by transatlantic telephone and a special radio hookup with the British gentleman 's vehicle . The New York Mayor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up-to-date communication equipment . It is a part of the local Fire Department 's radiotelephone system , which in addition to connecting the Mayor 's car with the city-wide and nation-wide telephone system , serves the cars of the Fire Commission and the Fire Chief . Officials state that this system is a great aid to supervision in fire fighting , for it enables one to get information even as he rushes to the scene and , if necessary , to give immediate orders for additional men and equipment . Most railroad systems in America , also , have their system of telephone lines . From one station to another or to a group of stations , telephone dispatching systems , because they require less time , less training and less physical and mental strain , have replaced the telegraph as a means for signaling and talking on sixty-five per cent of the railway mileage . Between stations , portable telephones ? which can send a signal over 400 miles of ordinary open wire ? may be connected to the lines . Wrecking trains , handcars , and freight as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may communicate with headquarters whenever desirable . The telephone is especially valuable in cases of emergency // because any member of the train crew can telephone the dispatcher the necessary information . If a cloudburst has washed earth and stone from a steep hill onto the tracks , the engineer can bring the train to a stop , the brakemen raise a long rod to the overhead wires of the railroad 's telephone system , clamp down the contact arms , and hook up the portable phone to report the condition to the next station and ask for further orders . On the great royal-blue and silver train of the Canadian National Railroad which was the home of King George and Queen Elizabeth while they were visiting this country in 1939 , was a complete telephone system . When the King wished to confer with a member of his party nine cars ahead , he simply lifted his gold-finished handset of latest bell-in-base design and talked . Almost every day the Queen talked with the little princesses in London by transatlantic radiotelephone right from the train , when it made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also , telephone men are waiting at every stop to connect his car by special long distance circuits to the White House . In some foreign countries , before the war , radiotelephone service was provided for passengers on extra-fare express trains . Some twenty-five years ago , in this country , telephone facilities were provided , experimentally , for fast-moving trains , but the demand has never seemed to warrant providing them on a commercial basis . Our " crack " trains , however , are equipped with telephones which may be plugged into the nation-wide telephone network as soon as they stop at stations . The very large buildings and the skyscrapers for which American cities are famous would be inoperable without // the telephone . Many hotels , office buildings , large stores and hospitals require telephone systems and staffs comparable to those in fair-sized towns . Some of them present rather interesting features . In large hotels , for example , most of the contacts between the guest and the manage-ment are by telephone ; the guest has come to regard the telephone as a means of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ management is to convey effectively its eagerness to make his stay pleasant and comfortable , good telephone service is essential . This means not only that the voice which answers the guest 's call must " wear a smile , " but also that there must be adequate communication facilities with all service departments , so that orders for the room boy , the restaurant , or the housekeeper , may be promptly fulfilled . It means that all the guests ' incoming and outgoing calls must be quickly and accurately handled , and that the management must be able to make contact with any department at all times . The foreign diplomats , attending an international conference , will require a different type of telephone service from the newsboy 's or woman 's club convention delegates ; the staff must be prepared for all kinds . The Waldorf-Astoria which occupies an entire block in New York City is rather proud of its communication service . A network of teletypewriters throughout the enormous building makes it possible for the room clerk , the bookkeeper , the floor clerk and the housekeeper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you leave the desk ; and when the elevator door opens at your floor , someone is there to greet you and call you by name , while showing you to your room . All members of the staff , who are to assist you or be influenced by your departure , are similarly notified when you are ready to leave , and each // steps up to do his part in proper sequence . A special information service , the " About the City Bureau " is also maintained to answer guests ' questions by telephone . The Stevens in Chicago , said to be the world 's largest hotel , uses the P-A-X Automatic Interior Telephone System for supervising and directing its 1 Soo employees in their daily routine of keeping 3000 rooms spick and span , serving 5000 meals , and creating a favorable impression on its many guests . This system is also used by the management in New York 's " city within a city , " Rockefeller Center . Four hundred P-A-X phones provide its engineers , renting and purchasing agents , operating superintendents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in eleven buildings ? to warehouses , elevators , machine shops , boiler rooms , etc . This system is a product of the company started by the Kansas City undertaker , Strowger , whose automatic system was mentioned in Chapter II ; it may be used for any number of private phones from five to ten thousand . The instruments and necessary operating equipment are bought outright ; they are not subscribed for like the city and nation-wide telephone service which they supplement , and they do not require the attendance of an operator . The fact that connections are made automatically and are locked against intrusion , appeals to many executives who like to feel sure that their conversations and orders can not be divulged and discussed by subordinates . The way it makes possible the carrying on of internal business without tying up outside calls appeals to others . The hospitals ' facilities are somewhat similar to those of the hotels in the matter of telephones . One distinctive feature about their service is the " soft speaker " system // which links every ward , so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the attendant 's call for him may go simultaneously to all sections of the building without causing any disturbance to patients . In becoming a great American institution , the telephone has developed two aspects which the average subscriber is apt to think little about , the legal and the esthetic . With relatively little fanfare , there have grown up , through the years , a monumental number of regulations and rulings , by various state commissions and courts , to determine the responsibilities and liabilities which the telephone companies have to the public in the operation of their properties . These vary in different states and are subject to constant revision . The American Telephone and Telegraph Company retains what has been called the most able legal department in the country for keeping itself and its operating companies straight with respect to existing law and for warding off possible difficulties . Skipping through an alphabetical list of rulings pertaining to the telephone , one finds such headings as " Abandonment of Territory .. . Coin Box Service , Right of Company to Require Use of .. . Depots , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eminent Domain . . . Fraudulent Use of Service . . . Gambling , Refusal of Service . . . Highways , Poles along . . . Liability for Highway Accidents . . . Moving Underground Plant . . . Pay Station Theft . . . Profanity . . . Rates , Discrimination in . . . Right of Way . . . Taxation . . . Toll Overcharges . . . Tree Trimming . . . Wire Tapping . " While the big rate cases against the telephone companies are the ones the public hears most about , minor suits of various sorts are also brought from time to time ; a business // subscriber 's name is listed incorrectly and he sues for the losses he claims to have suffered as a result ; an advertiser sues because a binder is put over the back page advertisement he paid for ; an operator sues a subscriber for using foul language to her ; a storekeeper thinks it was because of the telephone wires that his shop was struck by lightning , and brings suit . A prize case was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmer whose mule had been standing near a telephone pole and got his tail twisted around a guy wire . The mule became excited and pulled away minus the tail . Since a tailless mule can not swish flies , he is good for nothing , and the owner sued the telephone company for a replacement . Incidentally , for the sake of their public relations , they gave him a new , fully equipped mule . The training in safe practices and first aid , which tens of thousands of telephone employees have received , is also important in connection with the companies ' public relations . Not only does this develop habits of working and everyday conduct that prevent linemen and installers from making themselves a nuisance or a hazard , but it guards against the occurrence of accidents , too , and puts into active circulation a great number of men and women capable of rendering vital assistance in the places where accidents happen . In memory of Theodore N. Vail , who played such a prominent role in putting the telephone into the big business class , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was established in 1920 . Over a thousand men and women of Independent as well as of Bell companies , have been cited for the rescues which they have accomplished individually or in part by their alertness and // intelligent " service beyond the line of duty . " Here are a few of their stories : As two telephone men of Independence , Kansas , were preparing for a toll line inspection trip early one morning , the roar of an airplane motor , unusually close , attracted their attention . They saw a large tri-motor plane flying very low over the town , at a rate of speed well below normal and with a very definite list . After covering only a few miles of their trip , they spied the wreckage of the plane in a freshly plowed field , left their car , and hurried to the wreck . The pilot was dead , the remaining thirteen people aboard the plane all seriously injured . One telephone man asked his fellow worker to call ambulances and doctors , and himself organized a rescue squad , and directed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop smoking , since the wreck , the passengers , even the rescuers were soaked with gasoline . When the only ambulance available could carry but three of the injured , he quickly arranged for the others to be taken to the hospital in private cars , and assisted in placing them in the cars . He aided the small hospital staff in caring for the injured , and telephoned for a physician and nurses from neighboring towns . His treatment of the injured was so efficient that he was credited with a substantial part in the saving of many lives . In a mine near Miami , Oklahoma , a cage dropped sixty feet , killing one man and injuring two others . Because of his known competence in first aid work , a telephone repairman working near by was asked to go down another shaft with two miners to care for the injured . He made a perilous journey along an abandoned underground route to reach them , controlled their bleeding with materials available , cared for their other serious injuries , and supervised their removal on improvised stretchers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and effective work , one of the injured miners recovered . An operator , who had been informed of a bank holdup , checked the path of the gangsters ' escape by telephoning farmers along various roads ; and , by keeping the police cars in96 THE TELEPHONE IN A CHANGING WORLD formed , helped to bring about the capture of several public enemies . Some children were playing with the electric trains under a Christmas tree in the lobby of a hotel in Jersey City , New Jersey . A short circuit caused a spark which ignited the artificial snow and the fire spread to the dry branches . In a flash , flames and smoke filled the room . The private switchboard operator , just as quickly began calling all the guests , one after another , to warn them of the danger . Not until she thought she had covered every occupied room , and was almost overcome by the heat and smoke , did she leave her position , and then it was too late . All the guests , except one of the children , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The average subscriber may not have thought very much about the esthetic aspects of the telephone in the United States today , but recollection of the older types of instruments , booths and buildings in comparison with those of current design , indicates clearly a trend of respect for appearances and a developing taste . Though not ornamental by any means , the new handsets are honest and functional in design , and by special arrangement may be had in any one of twelve colors . Booths and public telephone stations , as well as telephone company buildings , are designed to conform to their function and surroundings . They look neat , efficient and not too conspicuous . In residential districts and small towns , the telephone exchange is housed in a residence type of structure set back from the street with a lawn . In business sections , the telephone building is usually one to which citizens point with pride . Directory covers are being designed more and more with an eye to appearance instead of advertising revenues . Poles , where possible , are set with regard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree-trimming , so that they may // make overhead wires safe , without marring natural surroundings any more than is absolutely necessary . All of this , and more , is involved in our telephone service , and yet we take it so much for granted , that no one ever thinks as he lifts the receiver and asks for a number on the other side of town , " I am asking in effect , Give me the use of several miles of wire in a cable under the street , a section of switchboard and all the other equipment needed in the central office . Give me one kind of current to carry my voice and another to ring the bells that signal the other party . I may need the services of an operator or two . I want all your equipment to be in perfect working order so that my call goes through instantly , clearly and without interruption . And ? oh , yes , do n't charge me any more than a nickel . ' " CHAPTER V TELEPHONE OPERATORS THE FIRST TELEPHONE OPERATORS , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a carry-over from the telegraph . ' They were boys , some not more than thirteen years old . While many undoubtedly took their duties seriously and tried to do their best , not a few of them , it seems , had the job thrust upon them by distraught mothers who hoped that it might keep them out of mischief . From some reminiscent accounts , however , it would appear that the telephone office only afforded greater facilities for causing annoyance ; several of these boy operators , who grew up with the telephone business , recall how they yelled at each other , whittled on the boards , leaped pell-mell between switches ? not , of course , with the idea of expediting service , but for the sheer fun of it , and if they could knock over a couple of fellow operators in the process , so much the funnier . When some other diversion held their attention , they would leave a call unanswered for any length of time , and then return the impatient subscriber 's profanity with a few original oaths . Though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the first operators were " not old enough to be talked to like men , and not young enough to be spanked like children , " and , until better methods were devised for the operation of telephone exchanges , they were kept on , and performed a variety of functions . Often , in 98 // addition to finding which one of many close-set like-sounding bells was ringing , and to making the desired connections , the job consisted of sweeping the office , keeping coal on the fire and carrying out the ashes , running errands , collecting bills , throwing wagon spokes at line wires when they became " crossed " by the wind , and shouting through the window to the hackman on the street that Mr. Soand-So had called for him to meet the eleven-thirty train ? all for five dollars a week . The idea of trying girls as operators seems to have dawned on two managers almost simultaneously . The New England Bell Telephone Company claims the title , First Female Telephone Operator , for Miss Emma Nutt , while the New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kennedy . In the late ' seventies , many people thought that it was not quite decent for young girls to go outside of their homes for employment ; it jeopardized their chances of marriage . Though the typewriter , with the same essential features as today 's , appeared at about the same time as the telephone , it did not come into general use until the ' nineties when the touch system began to be taught , and even then " respectable " parents did not approve of their daughters becoming typists and spending their days in offices with men . Some thought it less compromising to serve as clerks in shops or dry goods stores ( there were no department stores in those days ) , but this , on the other hand , thrust a girl into contact with people of all sorts , and one could make no secret of the fact that she was working . The desire to earn some money which she could call her own and spend as she pleased , however , lured many a girl to seek remunerative employment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many who found it necessary to earn their own living or to help with their family 's finances . For these , telephone operating was an interesting alternative to clerking , factory work , dressmaking and millinery , or nursing , a profession which had only recently become dignified and popular , thanks to Florence Nightingale and Clara Barton , and their application of the newly recognized principles of hygiene and sanitation . Among the early telephone operators were girls who had had experience also as cashiers , copyists , bookkeepers and clerical workers . The usual grammar school education appears to have been sufficient for any of these jobs . Little thought was given to educational qualifications . Public high schools had developed rapidly in the United States after the Civil War , but it was by no means customary for girls to continue their education this far , unless they meant to become teachers or to enter one of the professions newly opened to them . It was difficult at first to get girls for telephone operators . Office managers occasionally went into the home of a gentle soft-voiced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy operator , and pleaded with the parents to let their daughter take the job . Friends quickly recommended friends , however , and since the work they offered was steady , under more pleasant conditions and for shorter hours than the factory , less fatiguing and more secluded than the store , and fascinating because of its novelty and possible future , telephone companies soon found themselves with long waiting lists of girl applicants . On such a list , " one might remain for one or two years , " a pioneer operator wrote , " unless powerful aldermanic influence intervened . " Employment offices or departments , as separate entities , TELEPHONE OPERATORS IOI did not come into being much before 1900 , and there was no uniformity or formality in the steps to be taken in applying for a job or being hired . Some employers would not take a girl unless her father was dead and she had to support herself . Others would hire no widows , grass widows , sisters , married women , or women from out of town . Some required the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true among telephone office managers as well as elsewhere . One young girl from Bayonne , New Jersey , journeyed by horsecar and ferry across the Hudson River , and arrived at a New York telephone office before nine o'clock in the morning , to tell the Traffic Superintendent how much she wanted to be an operator , how her friend was an operator , and how sure she was that she would like operating too . The Traffic Superintendent told her he would send for her if she were needed . " You wo n't forget , will you ? " she inquired eagerly . " No , I wo n't forget , " he replied . Organized training or instruction for new operators was unheard-of in those days . They received some help from more experienced hands , and the rest came with time and practice . In a small office , the new operator sometimes stopped by on Saturday evening to have a friend show her how to work the board at which she was to start on Monday morning . In busy offices , it was rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls , and let them learn by watching . After a day or two of looking on , supplemented by such verbal instructions as the older operators could give them , the novices were allowed to handle calls themselves , during slack periods , until they became proficient enough for full-time operating . IO2 THE TELEPHONE IN A CHANGING WORLD With such hit or miss preparation , girls often got misconceived notions ; not infrequently they referred to a " tone test " as a " tongue test , " a " trunk " as a " trump , " or to a " circuit key " as a " circus key . " Calls were usually made by name , until an office had about a thousand subscribers , then numbers were introduced . This usually met with violent protest on the part of subscribers who disliked bothering to look up numbers . " It seemed as if the public went suddenly blind , " one operator said . For this reason , many especially conscientious and obliging operators spent their spare time studying the new directories , and memorizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ' nineties . An operator might answer a subscriber 's signal with " Hello . Number ? What is it please ? What number do you want ? or even What ? " depending on her mood . Sometimes she would say " thank you " or repeat the number , sometimes she made the desired connection without saying anything . " Our training , " narrates an operator who began work at a switchboard in Chicago , in 1883 , " was brief , and was about as follows : This is the switchboard ; this is a plug ; and this is a jack . When a drop falls , you will plug into the jack directly under the drop and speak into this part of the telephone ? it is called the transmitter . You will put this part to your ear ? it is called the receiver . You will give your number , which is thirty-six , and the subscriber will give you either the name or number of the party he wants . If he gives you the name , look the number up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these tickets , and pass it to the operator directly behind you , who will complete the connection . ' Unfortunately for me , the tone of voice to use was not mentioned , and // there was no doubt a startled subscriber when , thinking to facilitate his hearing at such a distance , I yelled my number loudly . Promptly the manager advised me to hang my head out of the window : the subscriber will hear you better , and it will be more quiet in the office . ' " The routine of operators answering with their own number is said to have been introduced for the purpose of discouraging " date-makers . " " A good manner and a soothing voice , " one of them related , " was our only protection against irate and profane customers who had become accustomed to swearing both at and with the boy operators . " When a doctor subscriber dropped into a New England office , and explained to the operator that he was apt to swear occasionally but that he would not mean it , she promptly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Though many of these pioneer girl operators were still in their teens , and most of them had neither seen nor used a telephone before , it was soon generally conceded that their service was much superior to that of the boys . True , they were often fond of " airing their voices , " and wasted some time talking with subscribers , but on the average they handled their ca11s more promptly and pleasantly than the boys and it was said , " are steadier , do not drink beer and are always on hand . " They did not , however , replace the boy operators at once . The transition took place slowly . Since most girls were allowed by their parents to work only during the daytime , boys were kept on the night shift , generally , in the United States , until after 1900 . For several years , after girls were introduced as operators to preside over the boards where calling subscribers ' signals dropped , boys continued I04 THE TELEPHONE IN A CHANGING WORLD to be employed to connect the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These switch-boys usually gave the most attention to the girls whom they liked , or the ones who yelled the loudest . If a boy liked an operator , he put up her connection right away ; if not , he might stand and grin at her , and she could shout until she was hoarse and then resort to the manager . The manager sometimes disciplined an especially obstreperous switchboy by making him stand in a corner until he was ready to apologize ; but the corner often seemed preferable to the switchboard , and the spirit of repentance , overcome with inertia . Years later , however , when men , who in their youth had been boy operators , were asked what they had thought , at the time , about the girls taking their places , they replied , with perhaps better manners than memories , " We liked them ; it was the best step the company ever took . " Sunday work was another problem , ' fifty years ago . Sadie Means , for example , an operator at Columbia , South Carolina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attendant at church services , until her job demanded that she work on the Sabbath . Fellow members of the congregation with which Sadie had worshipped were thoroughly incensed by her unorthodox conduct and carried the case to a General Assembly of the denomination . After long and serious debate by the brethren , and a vote of fortyeight to fifteen , Sadie was finally vindicated , on the ground that maintaining telephone service on Sunday , in the event of accidents , illness or other disasters , was really an act of mercy . Since the telephones were still used almost entirely for business rather than social purposes , very few calls went // through an exchange on Sunday , and , for that reason , it was thought no more than fair that operators should work a much longer shift ( or in telephone parlance " tour " or " trick " ) on Sundays than on business days . There was no general practice , in these early days , concerning pay for Sunday work ? sometimes extra pay was given , sometimes the operators were given another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not allow their daughters to work on Sundays at all . In such cases the manager himself tended the exchange on the Sabbath , or the girl hired another , of less devout descent , to substitute for her . The operator 's costume in the majority of offices was an entirely personal matter , but a few managers insisted on uniforms , of black skirts and white shirtwaists in warm weather , replaced by black shirtwaists in winter . Later , in some offices , black dresses with white collars and cuffs and white aprons were uniform . It is recorded that in the days of high black buttoned shoes , one operator was reprimanded for appearing for work in a modish new pair of tan slippers . Bracelets and excess furbelows , which interfered with operating , frequently were forbidden ; in one office bows in the hair were forbidden also . A pioneer operator in Paterson , New Jersey , recalls how in bad snowstorms she used to wrap her legs in newspapers tied on with twine and carry a broom to make her way to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company buildings ; a switchboard and an operator were tucked away in the corner of an office , the back room of a general store , an attic , loft , or railroad station , and there was a telephone exchange . ' A manager 's desk equipped with listening-in apparatus , and a couple of chairs for visitors , t o6 THE TELEPHONE IN A CHANGING WORLD sometimes accompanied the switchboard at a discreet distance . A public telephone was often there too . Oil lamps , or gas burners supplied the illumination , and small wood or coal stoves , the heat in winter . Operators , as often as not , hung their wraps and washed their hands " somewhere behind the switchboard , " and ate the lunch which they brought from home " over by the window . " If any " fixing up " was done , the girls usually did it themselves ; some of them put up hanging ferns and curtains for their own satisfaction ; dusting and cleaning was part of their job , and they also had to devote some time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from interfering with the working of the switchboard . During thunderstorms the switchboards would be alive with sparks ; then , as one operator recalled , " we would go out in the hall and sing . " One by one in some offices were introduced : gas plates , where water could be heated for a cup of tea ; some dishes , brought from home ; a cot , to be used by the night operator ; and an arm or rocking chair , in which one could sit and do fancywork or read during dull periods . Employers generally had not yet come to think it their duty , or to their interest , to provide for the comfort and health of their employees ; that was , in telephone offices as everywhere else , the employees ' own concern . Operators ' wages varied from one company to another , according to the section of the country , and even within a single company . In general , they were higher in the larger offices and in the North , lower in small communities and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they did , and where they did it , and the number of years of service they had to their credit , girl operators earned anywhere from six to forty dollars a month . The salaries // of telephone employees have usually been considered rather good for the given time and place . ' In addition to the wages paid them by the companies , girl operators used to receive substantial presents from subscribers , in the days before multiple switchboards were introduced . Then it was customary for each operator to attend regularly to the group of subscribers on her particular board , and she came to know their voices and telephone habits well . Mr. Waters , who ran the coal and ice business and stuttered , cranked his bell to signal his operator regularly every morning and asked , " A-a-a-Annie , g-g-get me tu-tutwo wa-wa-one fu-fu-four . " And Annie would reply , " Yes , Mr. Waters , and shall I call the others too ? " Then , one by one , without his asking for the numbers , she connected him with the butcher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . Mrs. Smith often called about eleven o'clock and said Bill had gone up to So-andSo 's place , and would Annie please find him and ask him to bring some hamburg steak home for dinner . Lawyer Brown called Annie whenever he was leaving his office for an hour or so and asked her to make a note of any calls for him . Operators also gave their subscribers news of fires and accidents , sporting events and elections ; they rang a subscriber 's bell to waken him at the time he requested , or listened for the cry of the baby , left sleeping by the telephone with the receiver dangling , while its mother ran over to a neighbor 's . Personal services such as these were rewarded by Mr. Waters with a daily delivery of ice during the summer , an occasional cake or pie from Mrs. Smith , a gift of money at Christmas from Lawyer Brown , and 1o8 THE TELEPHONE IN A CHANGING WORLD such other miscellaneous gifts as a bunch of bananas from the fruit dealer , free tickets from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Thanksgiving , cases of " tonic , " and ice cream , in hot weather , from prominent businessmen , a sleigh ride from the liveryman , or ? rare privilege indeed ? a ride in one of the very first " horseless carriages . " One especially favored operator reported having received , one Christmas , a hundred and twenty dollars , with candy , fruit and handkerchiefs besides . In many small communities and rural sections of the United States , the years have made very few changes in the telephone operator 's life . In many places , still , her switchboard is set up in back of the general store , or in a corner of the farmhouse parlor , and from there she continues to render the same sort of personal service . She is not on duty at night , for farmers retire early , but an emergency signal may summon someone if help is urgently needed to care for a sick person or to fight a fire . Independent telephone companies often contract with one woman to have operators on hand as needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmer 's house , it is usually with the stipulation that whichever member of the family happens to be nearest when a bell rings , will perform the functions of operator . ' Where such conditions prevail , there are several , sometimes many , subscribers on a line , and more than likely their telephone sets are of the old hand-ringing type . Some lines of this sort in rural districts are so arranged that no operator is needed ; when Mrs. Smith wants to talk with her neighbor , she simply rings twice and Mrs. Jones answers . Mrs. Brown , whose ring is three , may also pick up her receiver and listen to their conversation . If it is near the hour , the metallic strike of // mantel clocks often proclaims a number of receivers off the hook . As technical improvements were made in the telephone , and it became more convenient to use , its popularity increased greatly . Making a call no longer took a heavy toll of nervous energy , but was actually a comfortable and efficient means of communication . People @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have . In the cities , lists of subscribers grew to several hundred pages , and the average number of calls per day soared . More complex apparatus became necessary to handle the growing business . New buildings began to appear ? two or three stories high , with stores on the street floor , and , above , specially designed accommodations for telephone offices and headquarters . " Goo-goo eyes " switchboards were introduced with blinking lights instead of metal drops for signals . Automatic time recording devices , called calculagraphs , began to replace the wall clocks and the Waltham watches for timing messages and toll calls . Information desks were established . Business methods and operating practices began to be systematized . Operators no longer had to make test calls every morning to every subscriber to say , " Good morning , this is the daily test . How do you hear me this morning ? " There was little opportunity now for exchange of gossip and pleasantries between operator and subscriber ; their relations became more formal and impersonal . " Operating Rules " were issued which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chief operators and supervisors were introduced to assist them in their work and to continue their training . In 1902 , the first operators ' training school was established in New York and was soon II0 THE TELEPHONE IN A CHANGING WORLD followed by others in large cities , where various training courses were given and practice switchboards were used , so that the girls might gain some confidence and facility in operation , before they began to handle calls on central office switchboards e Along with these other innovations came greatly improved working conditions for the operators . Around 1900 , the management of many companies began to show more consideration for the well-being and comfort of their employees . At first , free lunches or bread and butter , fruit and hot tea , coffee or cocoa were provided ; then special lunch rooms began to appear . A decade later , cafeterias became popular . The individual telephone set , with receiver fitted over the operator 's head and the transmitter , into which she could speak directly , suspended on her chest replaced the old type , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rooms and dressing rooms were set aside for the operators . These were often supplied with tubs , hot water and fresh towels . A New England company permitted its operators to take half an hour every Saturday evening for upholding the tradition of the bath . Matrons or , in some places , trained nurses , were employed to look after the girls ' comfort , and in their spare time to hem towels , make chair covers , black sateen aprons and half sleeves to protect the cuffs of the operators ' dresses . Physical examinations began to be required for employees , but for many years no fixed policy in regard to illness was established . Sometimes the days of absence for illness were deducted from vacation allowances , and sometimes salary deductions were made . Other operators usually assumed extra work to make up for one who was ill . In 1913 , throughout the Bell System , a uniform Benefit Plan was TELEPHONE OPERATORS III introduced which granted each employee full salary for a certain period of illness , dependent to some extent on his or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death benefits were also provided for in this plan , because it was felt that employees could and would work better if they were afforded a sense of security by their employers . Soon after the Benefit Plan became effective , medical departments were also established in the larger offices , where employees could obtain remedies for minor ailments , and prompt attention in case of sudden illness or accident . The moral health of employees was also guarded by the management of some companies ; rules were published prohibiting the use of profanity or intoxicating drinks . Furthermore , according to one of these rules : " Cigarette smoking is strictly forbidden . No man or boy is to be permitted to remain on the company 's payroll who uses cigarettes . The only exception to this rule is the negro employees . " It seems that the possibility of girl operators smoking did not even enter the minds of these early telephone company Solons . Gradually , through more than half a century , telephone operators , by their courteous and faithful service , won the respect of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " in accord with the dignity of useful occupation due those employed in this industry , " had to be addressed as " comrade " or " citizeness . " Two Japanese operators , for their remarkable proficiency at the switchboard during a period of over thirty years , were honored with The Order of the Sacred Treasure , conferred on them by the Emperor . Several American operators had shown real heroism in various emergencies . But as the use of the telephone continued to increase , II2 THE TELEPHONE IN A CHANGING WORLD it began to be apparent that the manually operated switchboards would someday have to be replaced by automatic equipment . Because it was the latest and most efficient kind when telephone facilities began to be expanded abroad , much automatic equipment had been installed in various foreign cities , and its superiority in both speed and accuracy , as well as economy , had already been demonstrated . When our period of unprecedented prosperity in the ' twenties , therefore , created a demand for telephone service that it was almost humanly impossible to meet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the operators ' work . Dials , of course , could never replace the girl operators entirely , because they could not complete complicated long distance calls , supply new or changed numbers at information bureaus , or assist customers who needed personal help , but they did make it possible for the same number of operators to handle greatly increased calling traffic , and they did preclude the large scale recruiting of new operators which was previously necessary in boom times . On this technological development , Miss Frances Perkins , President Roosevelt 's Secretary of Labor , wrote in her People at Work : Of the hundreds of occupations in which women are listed in the Census of Occupations , only about a dozen employ more women than do the telephone companies . The human problem of the displaced worker when the cut-over was made from the manual to the dial system telephone exchanges is an almost perfect example of technological change made with a minimum of disaster . It was accomplished through human as well as technical planning . The company had owned the patent for automatic signalling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ central duty , for many years , but it did not put // this technological improvement into operation until we were in the height of our prosperity and telephone extension was going on at a rate which had not been anticipated . So many more telephones were being installed , that they could put the automatic device into effect at the same time that they were hiring more people than they had ever hired before . The change to the dial system was begun in 1920 , and the conversion was carried on gradually through several years . Hardship resulting to the worker through technological changes can almost be measured by the suddenness with which the changes are made . There was no serious dislocation when the labor-saving equipment of the telephone company was installed . ' The hiring of operators nowadays is a more formal procedure than it was in the early days of the telephone business . Throughout the Bell System , there are standard forms for applications and visitor 's reports which have to be filled in with information concerning the educational and home background of the job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar routines are followed . In New York City for example , to be eligible for employment as an operator , a girl must have satisfactorily passed a physical examination ? she should preferably live with her family and within one hour of traveling time from her office . She should have no major causes of friction or strain in her private life , and her family should realize that she is to render a public service and , therefore , is subject to duty at any time . She need not be a high school graduate but her penmanship , spelling and arithmetic must be good . She must also be amicable , sociable and have a pleasant voice , with no outstanding peculiarities of dialect or pronunciation . Curiously enough , for a vocation which employs more II4 THE TELEPHONE IN A CHANGING WORLD than 150,000 women , no aptitude test has been adopted for applicants . Chief operators seem to be able to tell a good prospect better by talking with her across a desk than by adding up her score on a formal psychological basis . Intelligence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highest I.Q. hired ? but it was soon found that these did not make the best operators ; they found it difficult and disagreeable to concentrate continually , and conform consistently to such a completely prescribed and highly systematized job . Left-handed girls may become long distance , but not local , operators . Though the spelling requirements for long distance operators , are more rigid than for local operators , strange as it seems , a long distance operator does not have to know anything about geography ; she looks up places in alphabetical lists , not on maps . The formal training of a Bell System telephone operator takes from three to six weeks . In addition to the handling of a switchboard , the new operator has to learn many other things ; how to give positive satisfaction to customers , ' good voice habits , how to keep well , the importance of regarding all conversations as confidential , and how to " carry on " in time of emergency . Since she is the representative of the company most frequently in contact with the public , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employers ' ideals of service , courtesy , accuracy and speed , and it is with her voice , chiefly , that she must do this . The operator 's voice training is therefore considered very important ; it is directed toward three objectives : improved public relations , increased accuracy and efficiency , and increased ease in speaking . By the way in which she says things , the sucTELEPHONE // cessful operator is supposed to convey to the customer her readiness to do everything possible to give pleasing service . Rising inflection and emphasis on the third syllable of " Number please " is supposed to convey some such impression as , " Good morning , sir , what can I do for you today ? " Falling inflection is supposed to be used for , " They do not answer , " to convey regret . A good operator 's voice must never sound cross or abrupt , nor should it lose its ring of sincerity , enthusiasm and perseverance . Girls with flat , tinny or nasal voices are not usually hired , for subscribers are apt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered to be somewhat slipshod in speech ; inclined to omit sounds and run words together , like , " VVhadjadoolasni ? " or " Imeetinertemorre . " Since habitual speech of this sort does not carry well over the phone and , also , since it gives the impression that a person is careless and lazy , it is not to be tolerated in a telephone operator . Beginning with the vowels , she is taught good clear diction by practising in front of a mirror the correct use of tongue , jaws and lips . She is also taught to direct her tones toward her upper front teeth , where they have more resonance than do tones down in the throat . Proper breathing habits are also taught in an American operator 's training course , because proper breathing is essential to increase the carrying power of her voice , with a minimum of strain and fatigue . It is suggested she walk around , inhaling for six steps , exhaling for six steps , repeatedly , so that it becomes natural for her to take full , deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horn-shaped transmitter supported on her chest , with a voice that can readily be heard over the phone , and yet is scarcely audible I16 THE TELEPHONE IN A CHANGING WORLD one step behind her back . If she were to speak too loudly , her good clear diction would be blurred by the volume of voice going through the phone , and she would find after an hour or so of work that her throat was beginning to get tired . Several years ago it was customary for operators to use a standard vocabulary . Approved phrases were designed to cover almost every question or response that they might be required to make , but after these phrases were repeated many times , they began to sound mechanical , like " telephonese . " When an exasperated subscriber finally blurted , " Are you crazy or am I ? " he certainly did not feel very much better to be informed , " I 'm sorry , sir , we do not have that information . " It is now considered much better practice to emphasize the friendly voice and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the use of " uh-huh , O. K. , I see , " etc. , and then let her find her own words . Skits have been presented to groups of both old and new operators , showing the customers ' reaction to the bored voice , the haughty voice , the curt or stilted voice and the exaggerated pronunciation of numerals such as " nyonne , fyuv , " and " thurree . " In switchboard technique , each new operator is trained for a particular job , such as local " A " operator , who answers the subscriber , local " B " operator who answers operators calling from other exchanges , or long distance operators . Later , she may receive additional training and do one of many other kinds of operating . The local list includes sender monitoring , information , time and weather operators , intercepting , verifying , trouble and special service ( the last for dial exchanges ) . For long distance work , inward , outward , through , rate and route , and ticket disTELEPHONE // tributing operators are required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the completion of long distance calls . In normal times , most telephone companies welcome the opportunity of showing interested visitors through an exchange where they can see for themselves what the operators have to do . The map on page 196 will give some idea of how long distance connections are handled . Eight of the largest cities of our nation , cities which are centers of important business activity and of natural geographical regions , have been selected as " regional centers " to expedite service on our coast-to-coast telephone network . These regional centers are : New York , Chicago , Atlanta , St. Louis , Dallas , Denver , San Francisco and Los Angeles . New York and Chicago are connected by one hundred direct lines over four different routes . Rarely are so many lines needed , but instead of as few as possible , enough are provided to take care of emergencies . New York and Chicago , also , have several direct connections to each of the other six regional centers , as well as to the important cities in their own respective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connections to six hundred cities ; they can plug in directly on Boston , Buffalo or Philadelphia etc. , as well as on Atlanta or Dallas . The longest long distance call which it is possible to make in the United States is between Eastport , Maine , and Bay , California . Eastport has a population of 3400 with 548 telephones . Now if , perchance , someone from Eastport should have an acquaintance in Bay , with whom he wished to speak by telephone , the procedure would be like this : The Eastport operator would connect him with a direct circuit to Bangor where , as in all other long distance I18 THE TELEPHONE IN A CHANGING WORLD centers , there is an alphabetical guide showing how to reach by telephone any one of 70,000 places in the United States . In Bangor , a long distance operator would look up the route and toll rate for handling a call to Bay and , with this information , ring the " inward " operator at her regional center , New York . The New York inward operator would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who , with a single flick of the wrist , would extend the connection 3000 miles across the continent , from New York to San Francisco . Inward and through operators in San Francisco , and a long distance operator in Santa Rosa , would pass the call on to Bay , which is a beautifully situated vacation spot whose year-round population of eighty people is served by five telephones . Altogether at least eight operators would have a hand in the completion of such a call . ' In addition to the eight regional centers , the traffic circles on our nation-wide telephone super-highways , there are more than one hundred and fifty " primary outlets , " each a crossroad for traffic in a more limited surrounding area . Chief among these primary outlets is our capital city , Washington . Long distance operators in Washington can make connections directly over more than 775 long distance circuits to cities east of the Mississippi . On a typical busy day they handle as many as 17,000 long distance calls . For every toll call she handles , an operator must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to accurate billing . When your connection is made , she inserts your ticket in the calculagraph and pulls a lever which stamps on the back of the ticket a sort of clock face , with an arrow pointing to the time when you begin talking . // Before taking another call , the operator also stamps on the ticket , separate minute and second dials , and sticks it in a wire rack to await the signal that you have finished speaking . Then , immediately , she inserts it in the calculagraph again and pulls another lever , which by an ingenious device indicates the exact number of minutes and seconds elapsed since your connection was made . These tickets are gathered up and sorted into piles according to exchange and number . If you ask on the same day you make the call , the ticket distributing operator will tell you , then , how many minutes elapsed and what the toll charge is ; otherwise your monthly bill will convey this news . Since an operator answers call after call ? sometimes as many as a hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her work requires considerable concentration . Operators in New York and other large cities , therefore , have a fifteen minute rest period in the middle of both morning and afternoon , and an hour for lunch in between . healthful working conditions and wholesome recreation facilities are also provided for them , and in some large cities , courses in Health , First Aid , and Nutrition and Menu Planning have been made available for operators at no personal expense . If you let your imagination play for a few minutes on all the romantic and history-making calls that long distance and especially overseas operators handle , you may think that these girls have just about the most interesting and exciting jobs in all the world . Anytime she plugs in , you think , she may be answering a Hollywood bright light , a Washington celebrity , or some other front page figure , making a call that any newspaper man would give his shirt I20 THE TELEPHONE IN A CHANGING WORLD to know about ; but whatever it is , the most thrilling , the most tragic or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it started , another light is flashing for her attention , and she can not take time to eavesdrop . Company regulations , also , not only forbid her monitoring messages unnecessarily or any longer than is required , but stipulate further that she must never reveal outside , nor as a rule discuss within the office , any conversation which she overhears . Since the war started in Europe , overseas operators have been handling a large number of calls between President Roosevelt and his diplomatic agents across the Atlantic ? calls of tremendous importance to a great many people ? the strict privacy of which must be guarded with the utmost care . Not only overseas calls but also many that are made within our own country , have a vital bearing on our national defense , and the Government regards any violation of their secrecy as criminal . In normal times , a Federal Communication Act puts a penalty of not more than $ i o , 000 or two years imprisonment , or both , on persons who willfully violate the secrecy of communications , but in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affecting national defense is regarded as treason and punishable by death , or by imprisonment for not more than thirty years . Probably because she does it every day , and is kept busy with the mechanics of it , the operator is rather rare who fully realizes how dramatic her job is . The only city in the United States where operators are required to speak other than English is San Francisco 's Chinatown . Here the operators speak , in addition to English , three different Chinese dialects : San Yup , See TELEPHONE OPERATORS I 2 I Yup , Heong San . In other large cities there are usually operators from homes where Italian , Spanish , German or French are spoken , who can help piece together broken English when the need arises . The operators at public telephone stations , especially in railroad terminals , are often appealed to by travelers who speak practically no English , and have not been met by their relatives or friends as they expected to be . The thirty-seven foreign communities represented at the New York World 's Fair also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the telephone company for operators speaking their language , and their requests were granted . Forty operators were brought along from their native lands and retrained in New York telephone practices and terminology after they got here . The overseas operators in Miami , San Francisco and New York use English entirely in talking with foreign operators but they have to know how to use the foreign directories to look up numbers . They must know , for example , that Vienna is Wien to the Austrian ; Leghorn is Livorno to the Italian ; and Munich , Munchen to the German . They must know the names of the principal central offices in large foreign cities , the way street addresses are given in different countries , and the meaning of postal district letters such as S. W. 2 or W. C. I in London and arrondissement numbers in Paris . European operators have a much more strenuous time with respect to language . British " telephonists " in peace times , in order to qualify for handling international service were required to be proficient in French , German , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cities of Cairo and Bombay also , operators had to be able to handle calls in any one of six languages : English , French , // and Arabic were required in both cities ; in Cairo , to qualify for a job , a girl had to know in addition Syrian , Greek and Italian ; and in Bombay , Hindu , Japanese and Chinese . In Shanghai , which has the dial system , the special service operators are required to speak the Mandarin and Cantonese forms of the Chinese language as well as the Shanghai dialect . A luxury hotel in Switzerland was reported , ante bellum , to have made operating even more complicated for its switchboard girls , by requiring them to slip a colored transparent guide , indicating his native language , over the extension number of each guest as he was assigned a room , and to be prepared to respond in the language indicated , whenever a signal lamp flashed . Imagine having to come out quick as a flash with J'ecoute for the lady from Paris , Ik luister for the Belgian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Prosim for the Czechoslovakian emigre , Per servilcr for the diplomat from Rome , Moshi moshi for the Japanese banker , and then be able to follow up with the proper responses . The qualifications for American operators are such that as a rule they are attractive , marriageable young women , many of whom leave their switchboards to make homes . Those who remain , married or not , as most of them do for about twelve years , may become supervisors or even chief operators . From the pictures of them in telephone company advertisements one might think that any operator could model for the typical American girl , but a visit to an exchange , where a large number of them are working , reveals tall ones , thin ones , short ones , fat ones , the young and not-so-young , the stylish and not-so-stylish , as in any other group . // As there are many types of individuals so there are many types of jobs among operators . Telephone companies employ local , long distance and overseas , weather , time and information , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are police and stock exchange operators , and private branch exchange operators employed by private concerns . The most important thing about the local operator , as far as most of us are concerned , is her presence and readiness , at all hours of day or night , week day , holiday or Sunday , to serve us . She and our telephone ( or for some of us city folks , the pay station in the store on the corner ) give us a comfortable sense of security , and the assurance that a call for help of any kind will meet with immediate and effective response . If we are feeling lonesome , she will bring us the voice of a friend . She will get us a doctor , ambulance , policeman or fire apparatus , in an urgent moment ; and just as promptly and pleasantly , she makes all the humdrum connections with grocers , butchers and drug stores , with relatives and friends and business associates that save so much time and energy in our daily routine . It is also the local operator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building , and boats , uprooted trees , and the debris of houses , go rushing by . During the hurricane which ravaged Long Island and New England , in September , 1938 , local operators stayed at their boards answering frantic calls for help , assuring marooned persons that their plight was known and reported to the proper agencies , and that help was on the way . Not until their boards were almost entirely out of I24 THE TELEPHONE IN A CHANGING WORLD service , and firemen in oilskins and sou'westers came to take them out in row boats , did some of the operators in the storm 's path consent to leave their places . Several refugees from Europe , notwithstanding their strangeness and foreign accents , have found American operators so uniformly kind and helpful that they have gone to various telephone business offices to express their appreciation . The gist of what they wish to say is this : " In spite of my being a refugee , far from home , and speaking your language very badly , whenever I drop a nickel in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a symbol of the American spirit . " Locating the person called for , is the forte of the long distance operator . Damon Runyon in his widely syndicated column " The Brighter Side " wrote recently : We will back the long distance telephone operators of the United States in the matter of finding a desired party against the post office people , the telegraph companies , or even J. Edgar Hoover 's redoubtable Sams . As a matter of fact , if we were J. Edgar Hoover , we would save ourself a lot of running around at times by just picking up the phone and requesting the long distance operator to locate the person we wanted ? say some fellow like Mr. Lepke Bucholtz , who is an absentee from justice . " Get Mr. Bucholtz on the wire " we would say to the operator . " B , as in baffling . U , for useless . C , for cunning . H , for hiding ? yes , that 's right . Bucholtz . He used to hang out in Pete 's place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Inside of half an hour the operator would probably be back on the line saying in that sweet tone of voice characteristic of all telephone operators : " Mr. Bucholtz has gone to Palestine . Do you wish me to call him there ? " // Many stories are told of the ingenuity and persistence of long distance telephone operators in " getting their man . " There is one about an operator who was asked to locate a man driving to Florida ; his mother had become suddenly ill and he was wanted at home . The operator asked if he made a habit of always using one kind of gasoline . " Yes , he has a credit card for Standard , " she was told . The next time he stopped to fill his tank , the man received the message about his mother . " Long Distance " had asked more than fifty service stations to look out for him . Overseas operators have a similar reputation . One of them recently traced an American traveling in Europe through three countries and connected him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Charleston , West Virginia . When overseas service was first opened , and relatively little used , a Long Island society matron called her daughter in London . The rate was than seventy-five dollars for three minutes . The two ladies chatted with animation , but ? so far as the operator whose job it was to monitor the connection could discern ? to no particular purpose , about bridge and clothes and a polo game . Three minutes elapsed . The conversation continued about a luncheon at the Plaza and a new family car . Another three minutes elapsed . The operator was getting worried . Did these ladies know what a bill they were talking up ? At the end of ten minutes the latest trick Sandy 's puppy had learned was being described . The operator 's sense of economy was touched to the quick . " Pardon me , " she said , " but I wonder if you know that you have been talking ten minutes and that the charge is two hundred and fifty dollars ? " " Yes , thank you , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm planning to talk twenty minutes . " Being an overseas operator develops an intimate feeling toward the world . From their several years of daily conversation with operators in Tokyo , the overseas operators in San Francisco find it hard to believe that it takes twelve or fourteen days to cross the Pacific by boat . The girls in New York feel as if they had many friends in Rio and Buenos Aires . And when the London overseas operators , with whom they had spoken daily since transatlantic service began , announced on September I , 1939 , that they were having to sign off on account of the war , some of the New York operators , for a few minutes had difficulty in fitting plugs into jack sockets . Weather reports are a rather new feature for the telephone . In the days of personal relationship between subscriber and operator , weather forecasts were frequently asked for and supplied ; in some communities they have continued to be supplied by " information , " but in large cities services which usurped an unusual amount of operators ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When the number of calls for the U. S. Weather Bureau in New York City , however , resulted in the busy signal on as many as ten thousand calls a day , something had to be done about it ; people who really needed particularized and technical weather data were unable to get in communication with the Bureau , and the telephone company was losing many nickels from people who wanted to know whether they ought to carry an umbrella , or leave their topcoats at home . And so it was arranged to have four government weather reports daily , at 7 and 10 : 15 a.m. , and 4 : 30 and 7 p.m. , supplemented by hourly changes in temperature and huTELEPHONE // midity , teletyped into a small soundproof room in the Telephone Building on West Fiftieth Street . There , an operator reads the forecast into a telephone transmitter that is connected with an instrument which records what she says on a narrow strip of metal tape forty feet long . When a change is to be made in the announcement , the previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new recording is made on the same tape . Weather operators are chosen for voices distinct and audible but as gentle and soft as possible . There are twenty-two of them who take turns , alternating with regular switchboard work . Many callers do not know that the dulcet tones they hear are really a disembodied voice ; some of them ask questions and a few say " thank you ! " An average of 20,000 calls a day come in to WEather 6-1212 , and half a dozen other cities in the country are now offering weather announcing service similar to New York 's . The number of calls is greater on Fridays with people making week-end plans , and during the summer vacation months . The majority of the calls , however , come from people whose business is affected by the weather . The fruit merchant wants a forecast to help him determine just how much to stock in highly perishable commodities , and the air-conditioning man needs frequent readings of humidity . So it is also with the superintendents of huge office buildings , who can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must worry about available storage space . If rain is coming , the restaurant man knows he must get in extra supplies of food and hire extra , temporary help , for rain drives customers into his place . Baseball fans from out of town also use this service to be sure the game is being played . During the World 's Series games in New York // a special announcement was added to cover this point . Subscribers called all the way from Boston , Milwaukee and Dallas , probably deciding whether they should go to the office or stay at home and listen to the game on the radio . It seems strange that the weather report , which is more complicated , should be recorded and that an operator should actually have to sit in front of a telephone , watching a clock and repeating every fifteen seconds , " When you hear the signal , the time will be four twenty and a quarter . When you hear the signal , the time will be four twenty and a half , " etc. , but it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report is exactly the same for at least an hour while the time report is always changing . Regular operators are designated in half-hour shifts for this monotonous job . If during some quarter of a minute no light appears on her board to indicate that some one is listening , an operator can skip her refrain but this seldom happens . In New York City , an average of 6o,000 calls a day are made for the correct time . In some places where the telephone company does not do it , enterprising individuals make a business of time service by getting local merchants to sponsor them . They advertise their time service in the telephone directory and in the shops of their sponsors , and between time announcements they tell about Springers ' sale of grass seed , Brown Brothers ' special on percale sheets , and so forth . " Information " in a large city is hundreds of operators in several exchange centers . Each operator sits in a threesided compartment , almost surrounded by directories which are very much more up-to-date than ordinary ones . Local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ installed within the last twenty-four hours , // and in many cities there are two , one the alphabetical name directory and the other an address directory , with the streets listed alphabetically and the numbers under them in regular sequence . From this address directory it is a simple enough task to find " the shop that sells stockings and lingerie on Broadway near 29th Street . I ca n't remember the name . " In fact the ideal call from the information operator 's point of view is one in which the caller first gives the address . The majority of calls to Information are by people who say they have forgotten their glasses , or are in a place where there is no light . Operators sometimes suspect that callers are just too lazy to look up what they want to know , or else that they are very poor readers . The " silk-stocking district , " where " society " lives , some say , provides the worst offenders in asking for help on things they could perfectly well find for themselves and then forgetting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the nicest to deal with , Information thinks , but they are not always the most interesting . It is from the housewives that the long story calls come : " Can you tell me the names and addresses of some kennels near such and such a highway ? You see we were bringing our dog home from the country and he got excited and jumped out of the rumble seat and some kennel called us and said he had been brought in there . We had our name and address on his collar , but I was so excited when they called ? I thought I could remember the name and place so I did n't write it down ? and then it slipped my mind ? but if you could tell me the names and addresses of some along such and such a highway I 'm sure I 'd recognize it . " Calls like this , of course , slow down a speed record , but // even so the average rate is about fifty seconds per call , fifty-four calls an hour . Visitors from Shanghai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because in China , they said , it takes at least a minute to get through with the polite formalities and satisfy the operator 's curiosity about yourself , where you are , the person you wish to call , why you wish to call , etc . The regular rush season for information is Christmas , when shoppers are calling for information about stores , and many people are trying to find the addresses of friends and relatives with whom they communicate once a year by greeting card . Where rural operators in Virginia , West Virginia , Maryland and Delaware have been replaced by community dials , which require no more attention than an occasional visit from a repair man , in order to keep up a little personal touch with its subscribers the telephone company operating in that area has introduced a rather special information service . Here in addition to questions concerning the time and the weather , you can ask whether the snow plow has opened the road between Doswell and Gum Tavern , whether the bus from Washington is expected to be on time at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's playing at the local movie house , when and where church fairs , sporting and social events are being held and Information will do her best to get the correct answer for you . She has even supplied recipes for this or that dish . Where she has to draw the line is on news flashes which might interfere with subscriptions to the local paper . Similar service is reported from Calcutta , India , where the Bengal Telephone Company opened a bureau , very popular with British subscribers , which answers such questions as , " Will you please tell me the Hindustani equivalents // of indolent and disobedient so that I may scold my servant ? " and " What is the variation in the boiling point of water per thousand feet above sea level ? My tea does not taste right up here in the mountains . " In Sweden , before the war , they had " speaking machines " like New York 's weather reporter to give out information on skiing conditions in various places , and on how the wind and water were for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type of information service is not looked upon with favor by telephone administrations , because it consumes a great deal of time without bringing in revenue . They also discourage the asking of questions which can be answered by the books which they supply to every subscriber . In many places abroad a fee is charged for even supplying telephone numbers . Operators in attendance at the public telephone stations are the only ones employed by the telephone company who see and are seen by their customers . These girls are outfitted in very smart-looking uniforms and sometimes have headsets in matching color , brown and green perhaps to go with their winter costume , navy blue and white for the summer . Being decorative , however , is by no means the biggest part of their job . Unofficially they constitute a sort of Travelers ' Aid Society . Strangers in town feel that these operators are especially human and likely to be helpful . The aged Polish woman who can not find the daughter she came to visit for Christmas , the negro man with two small children from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls looking for a decent place to spend the night , all appeal to the public telephone station operator . Maybe they had a friend or knew a girl who was an operator back home ; it 's very likely , because the // telephone operator belongs to a very large and world-wide sisterhood . Not all telephone operators are employed by the telephone company ? not all by any means . As a matter of statistics , in New York City for example , private branch exchange attendants , alone , that is girls who operate the switchboards in hotels , large offices , hospitals , stores , and other busy establishments , outnumber the telephone company operators three to one . Then there are the forces of special operators at the Stock Exchange and the Curb Exchange . There are also the " switchboard cops " who play a vital role in police work , and are usually trained for switchboard operation by telephone company instruction classes . The busiest hours of the operator 's day in a typical city exchange are : between nine and ten in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and offices are opening and housewives are placing their orders with the butcher , grocer and vegetable man ; and between four and five in the afternoon , when last minute arrangements for the next day 's business or the evening 's social engagements are being made . A stormy day that makes people stay under shelter , or an interruption of subway , train , or street transportation service , increases telephone traffic very noticeably . A serious accident , also , generally sends an unusual number of anxious friends and relatives to the phone and makes a hectic time for the operators . Figuring out how many operators will be required each hour of each day at each office is a complicated problem . Thousands of observations have been made to determine the time required by an operator of average experience and ability to handle the several different types of calls . About a hundred and twenty to a hundred and fifty local calls // per hour are what the average operator is expected to handle . To accommodate fluctuations in traffic with the operators ' five-day , forty-hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " trick " is the day 's work of any one operator ; it is composed of two sessions . It may be morning and afternoon ? morning and evening ? afternoon and evening , or night . Operators continually are their days off , but it is very important that they let their supervisors know when they are not going to be on the job , so that someone else can be called in , for Mr. John Q. Public must not be keep waiting . CHAPTER VI TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES WHEN THE TELEPHONE BUSINESS WAS FIRST BEING DEVELoped , lists of subscribers were printed on long narrow strips of paper , which served to show who were the progressive citizens already using the new instrument of communication . These were intended to encourage increasing use of the telephone and to stimulate others to become subscribers . They were the forerunners of the present-day telephone directory . Since the telephone was used almost exclusively for business purposes in those days , the subscribers ' names were grouped under headings indicating their professions or the sort of merchandise they sold . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " The following firms have already subscribed : " begins with , Amos Plow Company , continues with the headings , Banks , Boots and Shoes ( under neither of which are any subscribers listed ) , China , Glass and Earthenware ( four subscribers ) , Druggists , eight ; Grocers , four ; the headings Lawyers , Iron and Steel , Leather , Millinery , Publishers ? all are followed by blank spaces . The list of subscribers of the National Telephone Exchange in Washington , D. C. , as of April 8 , 1879 , among others , included : Adams Express ; Associated Press Office ; Bell , Prof. A. G. ; Capitol , U. S. ( Senate corridor near Secretary 's office ) ; Executive Mansion ; Hubbard , Gardiner ; Institute for Deaf and Dumb ; N. Y. Herald , N. Y. 134 // Sun , N. Y. Times , N. Y. Tribune , Treasury Department ( office of the Captain of the Watch ) . New York City 's first telephone directory was also a single sheet of paper and contained no numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in two columns arranged alphabetically under such headings as Banks , Bankers and Brokers , Tea and Coffee , Fish and Meats , Produce , Cotton Oil and Commission Merchants which now seem hodge-podge , but were probably logical enough in their day . The sheet , about two and a half feet by nine inches , was usually fastened on the wall beside the subscriber 's telephone . In 188o , fifteen hundred phones were in use in New York , but though the list of subscribers was printed up in a book of forty-eight pages , it was still by names without numbers . When the telephone business had grown to this point , however , it was complicated and inconvenient to handle by the original system . Early in 1881 , therefore , it was announced : " Subscribers will , in future , be known to our operators only by Central Office name and subscriber 's number and not by subscriber 's name . " The new book of a hundred and fifty pages , as an aid to patrons in identifying the new numbers , included @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the alphabetically listed names and numbers . Many objections to the bother of looking up numbers were emphatically voiced then , just as they were to dialing numbers fifty years later . In those days , it was possible to include the listings of all subscribers in the United States in a single book . With the development of toll lines , an effort was made to cont inuc to do this and , for several years , a national telephone directory was published , which listed all Bell System subI36 THE TELEPHONE IN A CHANGING WORLD scribers between whom communication was possible . The last of these directories was issued in 1897 . Its pages were a trifle larger than those of current directories , but it was not as thick as the Manhattan volume of the New York City directory today . Its total circulation was a hundred and fifty thousand copies . To combine in a single volume the listings of the fifteen million or more subscribers in the United States today , would require a book a yard and a quarter thick , with almost forty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , there are some thirty-six hundred directories of American telephone subscribers , ranging from two-page cards for some of the smaller exchanges to the fifteen hundred page Chicago directory , the thickest one in the United States . For all of these a total of over thirtyfive million copies are distributed free to subscribers , at an annual cost to operating companies of about twenty-five million dollars . So large a job and so integral and important a part of Bell System telephone service has the directory become , that the American Telephone and Telegraph Company has a special group of " engineers , " whose function it is to furnish advice on all aspects of directory publishing , including production , sale of advertising space and special services . Paper , type , type metal , printing , proofreading methods , alphabetizing , regulations with respect to listings , delivery , what to do with old copies , all of these and many more are their problems . Clearly , when telephone directories began to expand so prodigiously , they could no longer be printed on heavy book paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it also had to be durable and it had to be cheap . RegTELEPHONE // ular newspaper stock was tried for a while , but newspapers are usually read once or twice and thrown away , while telephone directories may be referred to and handled continually for six months or more ; furthermore , dirt specks or glossy spots which do ? not take ink well , do not prevent a reader from arriving at the sense of a newspaper article , and even if several words are blurred it makes little difference ; but if in a telephone directory , a single number fails to be perfectly clear , a host of subscribers may be greatly inconvenienced . These two essential differences between newspapers and telephone directories made the use of regular newsprint very unsatisfactory . The principal paper mills of the country in New York , Maine , Wisconsin and Minnesota were visited and their practices studied . Then paper-testing technicians were set the task of developing a newsprint suitable for directory use , whiter and cleaner than ordinary newsprint with a better finish and surface texture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through , strong enough to withstand high speed printing and frequent handling , and yet of practicable bulk and weight . The durable " bluewhite " catalog paper in current usage is the result . Over thirty thousand tons of it go into Bell System directories every year . If this were all joined together in a strip eleven inches wide ( the height of the usual phone book ) there would be enough paper to wrap around the earth 's equator more than fifty-five times . Attention was also given to making the type of letters and numbers as small and close together , and yet as legible , as possible . By dispensing with serifs and shaving some of the thickness from the inside of enclosing lines , so that more white space could show through and around letters and I 3 8 THE TELEPHONE IN A CHANGING WORLD figures , a special open type face known as " Bell Gothic " was designed . It was so much more clear and legible than other type of the same size that it was adopted by the Shanghai and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With the thinnest paper and smallest type practicable , however , the New York City directory by 1923 had grown to 855,000 listings and 1726 pages . This made a volume over two inches thick and a discouraging number of columns of Smiths and Cohens to look through . A separate directory for each of the five boroughs of New York City then came into being . Moving day for the American city dweller is more than likely to be around the first of May or the first of October . The number of changes in address and telephone number , which occur at these times , make the information and intercept operators very busy indeed and cause subscribers some inconvenience . It would be desirable to get out new directories on moving day , but directory printing and distribution is such an enormous job that this is hardly possible . The size of the job in metropolitan areas , and the speed with which it must be done , have necessitated a high degree of standardization in equipment and techniques . Not many printing establishments can handle . it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which do practically all the bulk of the nation 's larger telephone directories , and a schedule is worked out so that the large directories which are issued semiannually and those which are done only every nine months or so ( depending on the number of new customers who are eager to have their names appear ) can be handled successively . This schedule keeps the special perTELEPHONE // sonnel and machinery busy fairly regularly , instead of in tremendous spurts . The largest job in telephone directory printing is done by the Jersey City Printing Company . From its presses twice a year come over three and a half billion pages of telephone directories for the New York metropolitan area , several counties in New York and New Jersey , Baltimore , Maryland , Washington , D. C. , Philadelphia and a dozen or more other cities and towns in Pennsylvania . This company , like the others , prints both " traffic records " and directories . Every afternoon they receive , by special messenger or by teletypewriter , lists of that day 's new installations and changes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and each night , soon after midnight , a new traffic record is printed and ready to be delivered to the various information bureaus . It is fairly general practice to cumulate these records daily for about two weeks , adding the new names each day in alphabetical order to the printed list for the several preceding days . Every two weeks each New York information operator receives two complete new up-to-date directories , one arranged according to subscriber 's name , and one according to address . Information in Detroit receives complete new local directories every morning ; in Los Angeles , every other morning . Since about two thirds of the listings remain unchanged from one issue to another , and since accuracy is so important to a telephone directory , the type for the unchanged listings is used over and over again in order to save proofreading and to lessen the possibility of errors . In the larger cities , where traffic records are printed from the // type , regular type metal was found to be too soft ; its sharp edges soon wore off and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , therefore , was developed which can not be scratched with the finger nail like ordinary type metal ; it is hard and brittle like glass . This type , which is kept set up for traffic records , is practically ready for use when the time rolls around to issue a new directory for subscribers . After slight rearrangement , the type is formed into pages . Plates are then made of many pages at a time and clamped fast to the large rollers of a hundred or more horsepower printing press . From the presses with the largest capacity , signatures of seventy-two pages each , all folded in the proper sequence , roll off at the rate of fifteen thousand signatures , or about twenty miles of paper , an hour . The assembling and binding of these signatures into complete directories is all done by a most remarkable and fascinating machine , or rather series of machines ( stretching for fifty feet or more ) all geared together and each performing a distinct operation . First , there is the part that picks up in numerical order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for example , are added behind page 72 , then 145-216 , and so on . When these are all assembled with their edges even , and the folds all together , they pass a very sharp knife , which comes down and cuts off the folded portions . Next , the assembled signatures , all tightly held together , have to pass two wire brushes , which roughen up the smooth cut edge just made . Then a coat of latex cement or glue is applied to this roughened surface while it keeps moving , on past a device that slaps a strip of cheesecloth of exactly the right size over the sticky back of the book , and others that add the heavy paper cover , // fold it snugly over the printed pages , and stack the completely bound volumes in neat piles to wait for the glue to dry . The final trimming and packaging is done on separate machines , before the finished directories are loaded on trucks or freight cars to be sent to their respective distribution centers . For the hundred and seventy-five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days from the date when the listings are closed , until they are delivered to subscribers . Six hundred thousand copies of the Manhattan ( New York City ) directory alone are distributed every summer ; the winter issue is still larger . Into the smaller of these have gone something like moo tons of paper , 26 tons of cover stock , 13 tons of ink , 6 tons of glue and 23 miles of cheesecloth . Some one has figured that it would take fourteen and a half miles of shelves to stand them on if they were all to be kept in one place . A unique directory , from the point of view of production , is the one for San Francisco 's Chinatown , probably the only foreign language telephone directory in the United States . ' It lists approximately 2100 phones for the Chinese who live together in a fourteen square block section of the city . With a pencil-shaped brush dipped in sepia ink made from cuttlefish caught in the ocean near Monterey , California , a young Chinese writes out the original copy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directory . This is reproduced in quantity by a lithographic process . The distribution of directories in small communities to widely scattered subscribers is sometimes done by mail , but in general it is contracted for by concerns that make a business of distributing samples . At new directory time , I42 THE TELEPHONE IN A CHANGING WORLD regular armies of men invade a city , arriving with their heavily laden trucks and following prescribed routes . While private residences usually receive one copy for each telephone on the premises , several tons of directories are delivered to some large apartment houses and office buildings . The tenants of Rockefeller Center , alone , receive over seven thousand copies , or about twelve tons , of each Manhattan issue . To tell them where to go , and how many copies to leave , the delivery men have lists or a card for each subscriber . It costs , on the average , about four cents a copy to deliver the directories . As a rule , when new ones are delivered , the old directories are collected , so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed . Most of the old directories are sold as raw material to boxboard manufacturers . A large paper manufacturer in Wisconsin , however , has been experimenting with a non-carbon ink for printing the directories , so that the paper in the old ones can be cleaned and used , instead of wood pulp , as raw material for making up again into rolls of newspaper stock . Since the earliest lists of telephone subscribers were , after a fashion , classified , the classified directory is as old as the telephone business itself . From the beginning , it has served as a " buying guide , " for in it local merchants and purveyors of services have been listed under classifications generally descriptive of types of business , commodities or services . This feature in itself proved to be so useful to consumers and so profitable to suppliers that classified listings of subscribers to business phones have continued to be included , as a supplement , in most sizable directories . In four cities , the classified sections grew to such proportions that they were printed in separate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hattan , and Brooklyn , New York , and Chicago , and the " Yellow Book " of Los Angeles . ' There is one special business directory also which includes five of the New England States . It is interesting to compare some of the older classified directories with current ones , not only for the picture it gives of ever-changing business life and social usages , but also for the changes which have taken place in the organization and make-up of the directories themselves . The horse collar makers , carriages and wagons , oyster saloons and automobile goggles have vanished ; the miniature golf links came and went ; and many new headings appear each year , recent among which are air line companies , blood donor agencies , television apparatus , and trailers ? house . The passing of the dry goods store and hairdresser , and the rise of the department store , beauty parlor and delicatessen are clearly shown by successive classified directories . Forty years ago , who would have looked for air conditioning , cash registers , dog and cat hospitals , radios @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes in things themselves have also come changes in names . The old undertaker has become a funeral director or a member of an association called morticians ; an association of real estate agents , are realtors . Because of its exclusive nature , however , this association terminology is not used for classified directory headings . And although exterminators now aim to be known as pest control companies the Bell System will use this new designation only as a cross-reference until the public has been made familiar with it in other forms of advertising . Whereas , in the old days , little need existed for the control of headings , and they seem to have been made up some144 THE TELEPHONE IN A CHANGING WORLD times with little regard for reason , the Bell System , aiming to make the " yellow pages " of its directories of the greatest value and convenience to its customers , has recently distributed to all its general commercial managers a forty-five page memorandum , entitled " Classified Heading Practices and Illustrative List of Headings . " The idea is to introduce greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the end that fewer , more appropriate and serviceable headings will be provided which will catalog , without duplication , the business activities in the community . Complications are created by the fact that people from different sections of the country call things differently . While a New Yorker , when in need of legal advice , will look for a lawyer , a Southerner is more apt to look for an attorney or a counsellor . What to the Easterner is a trailer camp , to the Westerner is known as an automobile court . When a person contracts for the installation of a business phone , he is automatically given one listing under a regular heading in the Classified Directory . If he wishes his name to appear several times under various headings which apply to his business , he must pay for the extra listings . This type of advertising does not create a want for something as other forms of advertising aim to do , however ; it is not promotional . But if a want exists , it points out where the want may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made in the Middle West , to determine the most important factors in the making of a new customer , indicated that the greatest influence was personal recommendation ; a man 's friend says , " This suit I got at Schwarz Brothers surely has worn fine , " and he is inclined to buy his next suit from Schwarz Brothers . Second in // the list of influencing factors was the classified telephone directory . When telephone directories first appeared , little was made of trademarks or national advertising , but as the nation expanded industrially , the distribution and advertising of branded or trade-marked goods and services , on a nationwide scale , greatly increased . Until recent years , however , there was no sure and ready means whereby a prospective purchaser could find the local dealer , agent or representative of a particular product or service by its advertised or brand name , or trade-mark . In most cases , a person who wanted to buy something of this description had either to " write for booklet and name of nearest dealer , " or " shop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for . There were two serious disadvantages in this situation . In the first place , it was a real inconvenience to individuals who , having made up their minds that they needed or wanted certain specifically identified things , had difficulty in finding where to get them . Second , it was a weak spot in the nation 's economic life , since dollars spent for national advertising , having created a desire for the purchase of the advertised product or service , could not in most cases follow through by directing purchasers to the point where that desire might be gratified . The classified telephone directory has been able , fairly well , to fill this gap . While many telephone companies sell their own directory advertising , some prefer to engage the services of a regular advertising selling agency . The Reuben H. Donnelley Corporation , of Chicago , is the best known of these , because it handles the three separate Red Books , but there are several similar organizations that solicit the advertisements and extra listings for the yellow pages in the // back of other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business of the publication of directories . One of them does the whole job of providing directories for about seventeen hundred communities in the United States and Canada . It sends representatives into small places which may perhaps have only a mimeographed list of subscribers and , for a percentage of the advertising revenues , provides them with a printed book , bound and delivered . People have become so accustomed , through the years , to using the telephone directory that some of them have forgotten , if indeed they ever knew , the existence of the city directory . There was a time when city directories could be consulted in corner drug stores , railroad stations and post offices but in places where they are still kept up , today , they are less accessible and less often referred to . The telephone directory is so ubiquitous and convenient to use that we never stop to think what we should do without it.4 We use it not only when we want to make a phone call , but for locating places to which we are going or sending mail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whereabouts of long-lost friends and sending out our Christmas cards . Many people also seem to use it as a safe depository for paper money and documents of various kinds ; despite the admonitions of telephone executives , stories continue to appear about twenty-dollar bills and insurance policies which were hidden in the phone book just a few days before it was collected . Visitors in Honolulu have a way of taking phone books from there as souvenirs ; they 're not very thick and they have such an interesting collection of Chinese , Japanese , Hawaiian and // American names . Some people use the phone book , too , for amusement , making up various kinds of games of solitaire . They look for queer names like Carroll Bird , C. Hawkes and Johnie Wrenn , all connected with the Audubon exchange , or for such ones as " Angel Garment Corporation , manufacturers of the finest dresses exclusively for the funeral trade . " They also look for numbers that repeat street addresses or have some association with the subscriber which makes them easy to remember , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American Revolution . A somewhat more stimulating pastime is trying to make words out of telephone numbers by substituting corresponding dial letters for the numerals , thus MU4-9867 becomes MUGWUMP and CO5-6639 , BOLONEY . A few of us perhaps assume that we know all about the telephone directory , take for granted that it contains telephone numbers , and do not notice the new features that are being introduced from time to time . In some progressive schools , a study of the telephone book , and practice in using it as a source of valuable information , is part of the regular curriculum ; but grown-ups are expected simply to keep their own eyes open . The new policy of keeping the stiff cover free from advertising , of course , makes for a much more pleasing and dignified looking book , and several western communities have tried to make their directories more attractive by putting pictures of local historic or scenic interest on the covers . Many Bell System directories have on the front cover the Spirit of Communication , a figure drawn from the statue that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 195 Broadway in New I48 THE TELEPHONE IN A CHANGING WORLD York City , and several of the independent companies have adopted another similar figure , symbolic of a swift messenger . The most interesting new feature is the Civic Section . This consists of from one to ten pages of useful and interesting , current information concerning such things as : local post office substations , postage rates and air mail ; transportation facilities , local points of interest , traffic rules and regulations ; city maps showing streets , highways , parks , and public buildings ; the addresses and telephone numbers of principal buildings , etc . An index to the location of streets and facts about the history , industries , educational facilities , population , hotels , etc. may also be presented . In Cleveland and one or two other cities , the new Civic Section was found to be a very real help in promoting safety campaigns which , at the time it was issued , were being given special attention by local authorities , newspapers and civic organizations . In the old days , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hello , central . " Though they connected it with the operator , this " central " was really an abbreviation for central office . Nowadays we hear more about exchanges . Technically speaking , a telephone exchange is a unit for administering telephone service in a specified area . A central office is an operating office in which all the lines of a certain area terminate , and where calling parties ' connections are made . In places where there are only a few thousand subscribers , the exchange may consist of only one central office , which may be called by the place name . Allentown , Pennsylvania , for example , is an exchange area and it has only one central office , which is called Allentown . Miami , Florida , has several central offices but they are desTELEPHONE // ignated simply by one-digit numbers . Milwaukee has sixteen central offices , designated by as many different names . Before 1900 , it was customary in large cities to call a central office by the name of the street or neighborhood in which it was located @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ central offices were needed , this method often resulted in names which sounded so much alike that they were easily confused ; others , therefore , had to be selected . Many lengthy lists of what seemed like possible names were compiled from dictionaries , encyclopedias , postal guides , atlases , mythologies and other sources , but when all those that were not easy to read and say and hear and remember were sifted out , it always seemed that about two hundred and fifty suitable names were all that remained . Several cities were already rapidly using up this meager supply . Introduction of the dial system introduced additional problems . With dials the sound of the central office name was not so important as its first three letters ; these could not come in the same finger-hole , for any two central offices in the same exchange area . Abingdon and Cairo could not both be used because , though they sound nothing alike , they are identical when dialed . The plan finally adopted involved only a simple change from the one with which the public was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ' expansion . It retained as many of the neighborhood and historic names as met the technical requirements of calling , either by voice or dial , and greatly enlarged their usefulness by merely adding a distinguishing numeral to each central office name . PLAza , for example , became PLaza 3 . PLaza 5 could be added when another central office was needed for that neighborhood . ( New offices are added when the number TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES I5I there are over fifty directories for Canada ; one for Juneau and Douglas , Alaska ; one for Algeria ; fifteen for Argentina ; eight for Australia ; one annual for Iceland ; a biennial one for Italy and Possessions which sells for eleven dollars . One volume for Mombasa and Nairobi , Kenya Colony , lies between five for Japan and one for Latvia , in a steel file cabinet drawer . Java , Bali and Madura are all in one annual directory . The list concludes with Tunisia , Union of South Africa , Uruguay , Venezuela and Yugoslavia . There are twenty-one drawers full , in all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars . One of these collections is available at the New York Public Library ; the other is in a private office . Homesick strangers , it is said , often seem to find consolation just turning the pages that bear the names of their friends and erstwhile neighbors . Several people , who have been entreated to serve as sponsors by European acquaintances wishing to enter this country , have had to consult foreign phone books to refresh their memories about the would-be proteges . Property men from Hollywood and Broadway occasionally order a foreign directory as an authentic detail for a realistic set . More than for anything else , however , these collections are consulted in the preparation of mailing lists by all sorts of businesses , institutions and philanthropic organizations . Collections of phone books for various cities , from the earliest to the most recent , are sometimes consulted by lawyers and others to establish the identity or residence of a client , heir or long-lost mate . Several of these directories have been subpoenaed and presented as court evidence . The telephone directory , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " CHAPTER VII TELEPHONE BY-PRODUCTS AND SIDE LINES WHEN TRANSCONTINENTAL TELEPHONE SERVICE WAS AN accomplished fact , American telephone engineers did not sit back and feel that they had finished everything to be done . They continued to improve the quality of speech transmission ; to devise apparatus for handling an increasing number of calls , both local and long distance ; and to make further improvements and economies throughout the plant . Their aim was " a telephone service for the nation , free , so far as humanly possible , from imperfections , errors or delays , and enabling anyone , anywhere , to pick up a telephone and talk to anyone else , anywhere else , clearly , quickly , and at a reasonable cost . " In addition to this , there were the challenging possibilities of heretofore undeveloped radiotelephony . Both the Bell System and independent manufacturers continue to spend millions of dollars annually for research and development . The most outstanding telephone research organization in the world is the Bell Telephone Laboratories , in New York City . ' Many hundreds of physicists , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the manifold problems of providing " satisfactory , adequate , dependable and economic " telephone apparatus and equipment . Their experiments , on a large scale and in a wide range of subjects , pertaining primarily to the transmission // of speech , have incidentally resulted in a quantity of ideas , devices , techniques and apparatus which may be called by-products . Broadly classified , the more important and interesting of these are : contributions to the theory of modern physics , mathematics and the science of metals ; a science of speech ; the world 's most accurate clocks ; and aids to health , safe flying , education and entertainment . Because the telephone is a common carrier for what is perhaps man 's most delicate commodity , namely , speech , the forces which it employs are almost infinitely minute , and among them the electron is of tremendous importance . From the research of telephone engineers in electronics have come results of revolutionary significance to modern physics . Dr. C. J. Davisson , one of the leaders in this field , worked for years , trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the free and discrete electron of measurable charge and mass was essentially a group of waves limited in all directions . The experimental evidence which he finally succeeded in obtaining was considered so important as to win for him the Nobel Prize , in 1937.2 Dr. Herbert E. Ives , who has for many years been responsible for the Bell Laboratories electro-optical research and its development of telephoto and television apparatus , has also made a notable contribution to theoretical physics . The crucial experiment upon which Einstein 's Special Theory of Relativity depended , although recognized as of fundamental importance , had commonly been described as beyond experimental feasibility . Dr. Ives , however , devised a method and apparatus for performing this experiment and won the acknowledgement of Professor Einstein . Though carrying on no laboratory work himself , Dr. // Karl K. Darrow has made a most valuable contribution to physicists and their students , as well as to telephone engineers , by his lucid and carefully evaluated presentations of " advances in contemporary physics , " made during a long term of years . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T. C. Fry and Dr. W. A. Shewhart are well-known ; Fry , for his development of the mathematical theory of probability , and Shewhart for his development of concepts and techniques for the application of mathematical statistics to the " economic control of quality of manufactured products . " To metallurgy , telephone research has contributed several new magnetic alloys of remarkable properties . Permalloy and perminvar have come to be quite generally used in the communication field , in radio and telegraphy as well as telephony , for cable sheaths , relays and electromagnets , wherever it is desirable to have high magnetic permeability with very small currents of electricity . Vicalloy , a still newer contribution , can be made to hold more permanent magnetism than any commercial material . In addition it can be drawn and rolled , a property of decided advantage in many applications , which is not possessed by other important permanent magnet materials . Vicalloy has been rolled into tape one five-hundredth of an inch thick and one twentieth of an inch wide , several thousand feet of which were used for sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lengths are running constantly as endless loops in telephone weather announcing systems . It is thought that the properties of vicalloy mark it for a wide range of usefulness . A method for sealing copper to glass , first devised by a // Bell Laboratories engineer , W. G. Housekeeper , facilitated the development of huge , water-cooled vacuum tubes such as are used in high-power radio transmission . The most unique work in this field , however , is the metallography of Dr. Francis F. Lucas , who designed and had made for his telephone research , the most powerful microscope in the world , which magnifies up to sixty-nine hundred diameters ? about twice as much as any standard equipment . With this microscope and almost superhuman patience , Dr. Lucas has become known to Oriental as well as to European specialists for his photomicrographs of the crystal structure of metals . His methods and results have been studied by industrial engineers the world over , and various United States government agencies have called upon Dr. Lucas to contribute , to their studies , the benefits of his apparatus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metals , but also gun metal , and ship 's hull plates , have come under his microscopic scrutiny ; not only the fungus diseases of telephone poles , but also the social diseases of American citizens . ' Though Dr. Lucas did not invent the ultraviolet microscope , which is especially valuable in the study of living cells , until he invented techniques for working with it , it was practically useless . This type of microscope which depends for its operation on a source of light having a single , very short wave length beyond the visible range , is of advantage because this light can be focused on various planes within a living cell without sectioning and staining , and in the process destroying the life of the cell , as is necessary with other types of microscopes . Since the transmission of speech is affected by the peculiarities of the human voice , members of the Bell Telephone // Laboratories have , for a number of years , been investigating the properties of speech : the frequency of occurrence , for instance , of various sounds ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voices ; the distribution of energy due to accent and inflection ; and the importance of these and other characteristics to intelligibility . More recently , the study has been extended to include the mechanism of speech production , especially the action of the vocal cords in the generation of voiced sounds . By means of a mirror held at the back of the throat , and suitable lighting arrangements , it is easy to view the vocal cords in action ; but as the motion of the cords is exceedingly rapid , little can be learned by simply viewing them . A very high speed motion picture camera was therefore used , which made it possible to take as many as four thousand photographs per second of rapidly vibrating vocal cords . When these pictures were viewed at about sixteen frames per second , the normal rate of motion picture projection , they made the cords ' two hundred and fifty vibrations per second appear like only one , and the details of the motion could be clearly seen . These " speech " photos suggest that , contrary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vocal cords would probably never be recognized as a vowel by a listener , if it were possible for him to hear it directly ; it is the modification of this basic sound radiated into the air from the mouth , which is what we know as speech . This is a subject of special interest to the medical profession and vocal teachers , as well as to telephone engineers . Because in their problems of electrical communication , telephone engineers are concerned with frequencies ranging from less than one cycle to a hundred million or more // cycles per second , and with measuring frequencies with an accuracy approaching one part in a million , they have had to devise means for generating and checking such currents . Little wafers of quartz , it was known , have piezoelectric properties which make them vibrate when an alternating current is applied across their face . Though of electric origin , this vibration is mechanical and its fundamental frequency depends upon the size , density and elasticity of the piece of quartz . Such crystal wafers may , therefore , be inserted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequency of current fluctuations in the circuit with extreme accuracy . The crystal 's vibrations are so precise that they can be harnessed to provide the accurate time intervals for clocks and other electrical mechanisms that have to be operated at a fixed rate . As a matter of fact , if your electric clock is " plugged-in " on current generated in one of the huge power plants of New York State , it is probably controlled by the vibrations of one of these thin wafers of quartz crystal kept at the Bell Telephone Laboratories . Not only yours and millions of other clocks , but also millions of pounds of giant generators and motors in power plants , factories , office buildings , hotels and apartment houses , obey the beat of this tiny marshal , when they work on an alternating current of exactly sixty cycles a second . And this is not all the little quartz wafer does . Beside setting the pace for electrical machinery , and making the cheapest electric clocks keep time as accurately as the finest chronometers of former days , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequencies of radio broadcasting stations are checked , to make sure that a selected station will " stay put " in its place on your dial . 1 // To symbolize the importance of time measurement in the engineering and operation of the telephone plant , the American Telephone and Telegraph Company features a " telephone clock " in one of the large windows of its headquarters at 195 Broadway , New York . The clock 's accuracy is emphasized by a seconds dial , nearly three feet in diameter , outside , instead of inside , the minute and hour dial . The movement of the long red second hand is what attracts the eye , for the minute and hour hands are short and move slowly in smaller orbits . The element which takes the place of the pendulum in the usual precision clock , is again the little vibrating quartz crystal . Its performance is checked frequently and precisely with time signals from the naval radio station , Arlington , and has been found to be accurate to a hundredth of a second a day . Eight companion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time in various other cities throughout the world . In the early nineteen twenties , when vacuum tube amplifiers were beginning to prove their possibilities , people tried to use them for all sorts of things . Several doctors and telephone engineers got together and developed an electrical stethoscope for magnifying the sound of heart beats . This was found to be very useful in teaching medical students to recognize the peculiarities of sound associated with various heart diseases , and to distinguish the faint ticking of fetal hearts . It was even used by a doctor in Chicago to diagnose the ailment of a patient in New York , over the telephone , but this was only for demonstration purposes ; so many other factors enter into a diagnosis that this method would not be acceptable as general practice . Following the development of the electrical stethoscope , the doctors and telephone engineers who had worked on it , it 16o THE TELEPHONE IN A CHANGING WORLD enlisted the cooperation of the Columbia Phonograph Company , for making records of the heart and chest sounds , typical of various stages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used as a sort of reference library by students and practitioners anywhere in the world , and to serve also as standards with which to compare the heart sounds of patients . More recently an " industrial stethoscope " has been developed . This device measures the intensity of sound at any preselected pitch and turns a deaf ear to all other factory noises . It is used for detecting flaws in running machinery , such as electrical refrigerator units , roller bearings and automobile generators ; and also for detecting pellets of lead solder in canned goods moving along the production line . Telephone engineers used their science of speech , also , for manufacturing a by-product , which happily the world has little use for . In the United States there are only several hundred people who , because of malignant disease , have had their larynx , or " voice box , " removed by surgical operation . For these few unfortunates , however , an artificial larynx was developed so that they might still be able to speak , and we suppose , incidentally , telephone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stream from the lungs to the mouth . To convert this steady current of air into a pulsating sound wave , in place of the vocal cords , which no longer vibrate , there is a thin metal reed which is free to vibrate inside a spool-like box . One end of an artificial larynx is connected , by means of a rubber tube and pad , to the windpipe opening , made by the operating surgeon on the front of the user 's neck ; the outlet tube at the other end of the artificial larynx is introduced into the mouth of the speaker who must go through the ordinary motions of speaking , with his tongue , lips and jaw so as to manufacture , out of the basic sound produced by the artificial larynx , the voiced speech sounds . An adjustment is provided for changing the pitch of the larynx , so that it can be used by either men or women . By continual practice , people can become very proficient at speaking with an artificial larynx , and so be restored to the happiness and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since telephones must have receivers as well as transmitters , the characteristics of hearing have also been of vital concern to telephone engineers . One of the first problems they encountered was that of accurately measuring hearing . The tuning fork and watch-tick methods employed by doctors , were quite unsatisfactory for testing people with normal hearing . Another method was therefore worked out whereby a person listened with a telephone receiver for a tone that was just audible to him . As the pitch and intensity of the sound coming through the receiver could be controlled and measured , the hearing of an individual could thus be measured in an absolute sense as well as with respect to normal . As the results of this work became generally known , a demand for methods and equipment began coming from hospitals , otologists and others interested in hearing . Dr. Harvey Fletcher , director of this research , showed marked public spirit in his readiness to cooperate . Audiometers , for measuring hearing , were devised and put on the market , and chart forms , called audiograms , were worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These came to be used very generally by doc162 THE TELEPHONE IN A CHANGING WORLD tors , in clinics and hospitals , and in research on hearing . For diagnostic purposes , two kinds of receivers were developed , one of the usual air conduction kind to direct sound through the outer ear to the drum and ossicles , and another to communicate sound vibrations via the skull bone in back of the ear . Shortly after the research work was initiated , considerable interest was awakened in the hearing of school children . From national surveys it was estimated that almost two million school children were partially deaf . It was harder for them to learn and , later on , it would be harder for them to earn . If it were only possible to pick out all the children with defective hearing , and give them the special attention which they needed , much social and economic waste might be avoided . This time it was with the American Federation of Leagues for the Hard of Hearing that telephone engineers worked . Methods , equipment and record sheets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forty children from any school grade . The procedure was something like this . The children went to a classroom where everything was in readiness for the test . Each was given a telephone receiver and got it properly adjusted to his head . Then someone told them that they were about to hear numbers called , " first by a woman , and then by a man , who seems to be moving farther and farther away , so that the sounds grow weaker and weaker . " They were asked to write as many of these numbers as they could hear . A phonograph was then started and the children heard : " You are going to have your hearing tested . Write the numbers which you hear in column one . " Then the numbers were played by the phonograph , in gradually decreasing loudness. // About ten per cent of the children thus tested , it was found , were acoustically handicapped ; examination of school records disclosed the fact that such children repeated three times as many courses as children with normal hearing . The League @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest the nation in making the detection , care and education of deafened children , a matter of school routine . This movement spread very rapidly , especially in cities , and as far away as Honolulu and Capetown . It has been found that by medical treatment , lip reading instruction , the use of hearing aids and more favorable seatings , these repetitions can be cut at least in half . This represents a financial saving estimated at between S3600 and $12,600 per woo children , no mean consideration from the taxpayer 's point of view . Better than that , however , the hearing of probably more than a million children is now tested annually , and case reports abound in instances of incipient infections discovered in time to correct them , and " dull " children turning out to be " bright . " Work of this sort being done in Muskogee , Oklahoma , New Rochelle , New York , and the Iowa State University is especially notable . From tests made on our adult population , it has been estimated that every tenth grown-up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ordinary pursuits . For such persons , many kinds of hearing aids , based on telephone principles , have been made available , and continually improved . Whereas some fifteen or twenty years ago , such devices usually weighed upwards of ten pounds and were very bulky to carry around , more recent models weigh no more than a pound and a half , and many persons can conceal completely the fact that one is being I64 THE TELEPHONE IN A CHANGING WORLD worn . ' A program of public education is now going on which is aimed to make the hearing aid as acceptable and as socially inconspicuous as eye-glasses have become . Special telephone facilities are also available for subscribers whose hearing is impaired ; lower pitched , more powerful bells and gongs or visual signals , and a special amplifier for controlling the volume of sound received . Many churches , theatres and public halls are also provided with special aids for those who have difficulty in hearing . When it was found that the background noise in an average city office was responsible for considerable impairment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficiency , telephone engineers developed meters and methods for gathering scientific evidence against the city 's noise makers . Noise Abatement Commissions , the National Electric Light Association and the American Telephone and Telegraph Company all made surveys in buildings and out-of-doors , to determine which were the worst offenders , which were unavoidable and which could be soft-pedalled , by an informed public . Various local ordinances against noise , resulted from these surveys . Action was directed chiefly against motorists who used their horns more than was necessary . Many such offenders were arrested and fined , but in general the police found it too bothersome to enforce the antinoise laws rigidly . A reporter from a big city daily , in need of feature story material , decided , after several thousand dollars in fines for this offense had been collected , to go and remeasure the noise at a corner included in the official survey , to see how effective noise abatement efforts had been . " Good for the city 's coffers , but no help to the citizens ' nerves , " he reTELEPHONE // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noisier than it was before . " From the time during World War I , when they developed the system of two-way radiotelephony for communication between ground stations and planes in the air , telephone engineers have been interested in aids to safe flying . The Bell Telephone Laboratories , for several years , maintained a " flying laboratory " for experimenting with various aeronautical instruments of their invention . One of these was the terrain clearance indicator , developed in response to a consistent demand from flying personnel for a positive type of altitude indication above ground . Since the early days of aviation , the altimeter on board all aircraft has been of the aneroid barometer type , actuated by pressure of the atmosphere , and for obvious reasons , unless carefully calibrated and set for both the ground elevation and atmospheric pressure at a particular point , would not be accurate for that point . The terrain clearance indicator , as the name suggests , by the movement of a needle across the meter dial , gives the height of the plane over what is immediately below , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operating principle of the terrain clearance indicator is the measurement of time , of transit of radio waves of changing frequencies " bounced " from the plane to the ground and back again . The instrument has been demonstrated to many groups interested in air navigation and the principle of operation has been accepted and proved . It is expected that as larger airplanes become available the present objections to the current requirements of the instrument and to its weight ( it weighs as much as half a passenger ) will be largely eliminated , and it will be put into general use . // Another aid to safe flying , developed as a by-product of telephone research , was a device for guiding lost planes . This direction finder makes it possible for the pilot of a sky liner completely wrapped in a blanket of fog , if he has lost his bearings , to send out a call by radiotelephone , to the nearest ground stations . Operators at these points , on receiving the call , simultaneously , read bearings as given by a spot of light on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These bearings are then relayed by radiotelephone to a central point where the actual position of the plane is quickly calculated and radioed back to the pilot , so that he may head for a landing field and be guided in , if he wishes , by the operator . who knows his position from watching the tiny speck of light moving on the frosted glass . Since this new direction finder is still in the developmental stage , the Civil Aeronautics Authority has made only experimental installations in a limited area , and , at the moment , calls are received only at New York , Washington and Pittsburgh airports . At intervals of about a hundred miles along our regular air routes , the Civil Aeronautics Authority and transport companies have established radio stations , each with its own characteristic wave length , which planes may tune in on as the need arises . To save busy pilots the added task of retuning their receivers every time they pass from the operating area of one wave length to that of another , the Bell Telephone Laboratories developed still another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pilot 's receiver to any one of thirty ground stations . This device is just coming into general use . Their years of studying and transporting such a delicate intangible thing as sound , the intensive concentration they // have devoted to it , the patient , oft-repeated and exact analysis , far from filling telephone engineers with the contempt which is said to attend familiarity , have , rather , inspired them with the highest esteem . They have spent almost incredible intellectual energy on converting sound waves to electrical ones without weakening or distortion , conveying these through varying distances , and reconverting them to sound again with perfect fidelity . Their greatest achievements in this are enjoyed not so much in commercial communication as in art and entertainment . When telephone engineers directed their efforts to storing up treasures of music , so that anyone , at any time , might enjoy them in all their natural beauty , they made perhaps their most heart-warming contribution to mankind . Before telephone engineers tackled the problems of recording and reproducing music , Thomas Edison had developed the phonograph . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handled only a limited portion of the component tones of speech , and these it reproduced with raucous distortion . Since the phonograph method of recording and reproducing depended on the power of sound waves themselves , its possibilities for improvement were limited ; it could not respond to the more delicate tones of speech or music . By 1920 , the mechanical phonograph was about as good as it could ever be . Though its best efforts still sounded rasping and unnatural , people had grown more or less accustomed and tolerant ; its popularity was soon to be superseded , however , by that of radio broadcasting . By this time , of course , the telephone transmitter had been carefully cultivated into a special variety called the microphone ; the receiver into the loudspeaker . If a micro168 THE TELEPHONE IN A CHANGING WORLD phone were set to pick up sound , it converted into waves of electricity in wires , what a one-eared listener at the same spot would have heard . For phonographic purposes , this electrical current could be amplified to drive a graver , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A needle following the wavy lines of such a record , could create electrical vibrations , which in turn could be converted to sound again by a high-quality loudspeaker . The first public showing of this application of telephonic technique to the phonograph art was made in New Haven , Connecticut , in 1922 . The phonograph , with its electric amplifier and loudspeaker , reproduced from electrically cut records a lecture made to accompany a silent motion picture . The enthusiastic response which this demonstration aroused , indicated some of the future possibilities for sound motion pictures and encouraged development of them . Though a feeling then prevailed that the public would be unwilling to buy electric reproducing equipment , the process for making electrically cut records commercially was licensed , early in 1925 , to the Columbia Phonograph Company and to the Victor Talking Machine Company for production here and in England , and a much improved telephone by-product called the " orthophonic " phonograph was put on the market by the Victor Company . No longer was it necessary to group artists in unusual positions close to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pipes to violins . A microphone , out in front of an orchestra with its usual seating and instruments , could pick up the natural quality of the music . It was quite the thing in those days to give concerts with both the artist , in person , and a reproducing system on the platform , and then ask the audience to close their eyes and try to tell when // they were hearing the artist 's voice directly , and when via the machine . The fine quality of orthophonic reproduction brought great joy to music lovers and added to their number many new and appreciative listeners who had not been privileged to become familiar with good music before . As a result of the sound motion picture demonstration , synchronizing equipment was developed for playing electrically cut records of speech in exact time with moving pictures . This was licensed to Warner Brothers who brought out the Vitaphone version of Don Juan in 1926 , and relegated silent movies to the realm of the past . When film broke and had to be patched , however , difficulties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer in perfect synchronization ; the heroine was apt to be opening her mouth in the pictures while a booming bass came from the record ; still worse the villain might fall before the hero 's shot was heard . Almost simultaneously with this method , a photographic method of recording was also being developed . By this photographic method , speech-bearing electric currents were made to operate a shutter , or light-valve . This controlled the amount of light falling on a moving film , and in this way recorded on the film , in variations of photographic density , the variations in the speech-bearing current . For reproduction , the film was run between a lamp and a photoelectric cell , which originated a current to be converted into sound again by a loudspeaker . By the summer , of 1928 , most of the large producers of motion pictures in the United States were producing " talkies " by one of these methods . The film method was developed commercially as the ' Western Electric Noiseless // Recording System , which is now used all over the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movies . So quickly and fully accustomed to the talking feature have movie-goers become , that they do n't even mention " talkies " any more ; they simply take it for granted . But telephone engineers carried on their research in sound reproduction still further . Their most recent and remarkable achievement is stereophonic recording . Though this method , at the moment , is more suitable for concert hall than for domestic use , music recorded in this ' way is to enter the home by way of frequency modulation broadcasts . Stereophonic recording was introduced to the world with the cooperation of Leopold Stokowski and the Philadelphia Orchestra , of the Tabernacle Choir and organists in Salt Lake City , and of Paul Robeson and other artists . After their music or drama was recorded , these artists were allowed to hear it reproduced as it had been played originally . If he was not entirely satisfied , the conductor or artist was then able to vary the recorded volume and to change the tonal color to suit his taste ; he could soften it to the faintest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times that of any orchestra without at all altering its tone quality ; or he might choose to augment or reduce the high or low pitches independently . While he was thus enhancing the music or drama , which he had himself directed or performed , his interpretation was being re-recorded on film as a permanent record . A demonstration to show the full capabilities of this system was given at Carnegie Hall in New York . Choral numbers , vocal solos , organ , drama and grand opera , all were reproduced . What critics thought of this performance , is expressed in a quotation from the New York World Telegram of April 10 , 1940 :
