Shipbuilders , carbuilders , oil-pipeline layers , WPB and countless others are bemoaning the impossibility of getting as much steel as they want when they want it , but : <P> &gt; Between 5,000,000 and 6,000,000 additional tons could be produced this year by just utilizing the full 91,00,000-ton capacity revealed by last year 's Gano Dunn steel report and recognized by both the steel industry and the Government . Production last week was at the rate of 88,200,000 tons , but WPB 's Bill Batt is only hopeful that the year 's total " may go as high as 85,000,000 tons . " <P> No. 1 reason for this failure to get full production is the shortage of scrap , and No. 1 reason ascribed for the scrap shortage is the low ceiling price . Some engineers say an increase of only $1 a ton would bring in enough added scrap to keep the mills running full blast . The question now is whether it is more important to get the steel or more important to hold down the scrap dealers ' profits . If by any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shortage , then an $80-billion war effort might be held up to save $25 millions , just as a billion-dollar rubber shortage is being made worse to keep the profit motive out of rubber scrap collection . <P> Nearly 20% of Bessemer steel capacity was idle last week . Bessemer converters use almost no scrap , but they are indirectly affected , since the scrap shortage has put such a load on pig iron that pig iron is now a bottleneck too . <P> &gt; Despite the pressing need of steel for immediate use , more than 17,000,000 tons have been salted away in inventories , according to estimates in the Journal of Commerce , compared with only 4,000,000 tons in 1939 . This 13,000,000-ton hoarding has made the shortage much worse than it needed to be . WPB finally took steps last week to reduce this forward buying by setting up a new " End Use Code , " whereby they hope to be able to follow every ton of steel to its ultimate destination . Under the system now being abandoned , the Government admittedly had no way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priorities . Some plants are believed to have stockpiled steel they will not need until 1943 . Hereafter manufacturers with high priority ratings will no longer have a blank check for as much steel as they can grab . <P> &gt; Strip mills designed to make sheets ? thick for Detroit have been converted to make 1-in. plate . This has upped plate capacity by more than half , from 8,400,000 tons to 13,200,000 tons . Plate has been and still is the worst bottleneck in the industry , for nearly 75% of the steel needed for ships is plate . &gt; But many a layman overestimates the amount of steel needed in shipbuilding . A 10,000-ton vessel actually weighs about 4,000 tons-the 10,000-ton figure is its carrying capacity . The 8,000,000 tons of merchant shipping the U.S. hopes to build this year will take up less than 3,500,000 tons of ingot capacity . <P> &gt; Ingot production of 85,000,000 tons this year will mean only 60,000,000 tons of finished steel . WPB launched a drive last week to narrow the gap by requiring , for example , closer figuring on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desired product .
