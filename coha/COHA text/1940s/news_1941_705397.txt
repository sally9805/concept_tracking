txt No Time to Wait To the Screen Editor : As a constant moviegoer I should like to protest against a practice that is becoming increasingly prevalent at the large Broadway houses ? selling tickets when no seats are available inside the auditorium . Naturally , theatres have a. perfect right to sell the tickets , even under such circumstances , as long as the public is willing to put up with this inconvenience , but in the interests of good-will it would seem that an effort could be made to inform the public as to the length of the waiting period . Doormen brush off inquirers with " a short wait , " which is often misleading . On a recent Sunday afternoon , for instance , I waited in the lobby of one theatre for about an hour . before being seated . Does n't the customer deserve some consideration ? MATTHEW 0 ' DOWD .
