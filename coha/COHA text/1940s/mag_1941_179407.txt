Italy had amassed all the necessary ingredients for a first-class revolution . The war effort continued apathetic , ineffectual and , to many Italians , completely senseless . Favored Fascist bigwigs prospered from wartime grafts . Benito Mussolini lost additional face as Nazi officials took over key posts in vital ministries . Inflation increased . The tightened food-rationing system reeled along under the weight of flagrant violations . Military morale , ever feeble , ebbed to a new low as the British Army pushed into Libya ( see p. 19 ) . <P> The ingredients were there , but the will to combine and ignite them was pathetically lacking last week . The people watched the country 's slow disintegration , its gradual absorption by its Axis ally , and did not move . After 16 months in Rome for the New York Herald Tribune , Correspondent Allen Raymond , writing from " somewhere in Europe , " thought he knew why : <P> " The Italian people have lost faith in Mussolini , faith in their King , and sometimes it seems ... as though they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work hard , to breed , to endure hard standards of living and to survive . <P> " . . . Apathy and pessimism grip the people . . . . They pray for some miracle that may bring them peace early . Large sections of the people do n't care what kind of a peace it is , and many are far more afraid of a German victory than a British . . . . The people seem now a people peculiarly devoid of a capacity for hatred of anyone . <P> " They are an individualistic people which a generation of Fascism has been unable to regiment . . . . They know they are in the grip of a tyranny . Some few like it and get fat on it . Most of them seem to accept it with a grumbling resignation , and the capacity for revolt does not appear to be , at present , in them . " <P> Pungent facts and estimates documented Allen Raymond 's sympathetic diagnosis of an ailing people he describes as " one of the kindest , warmest-hearted and most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's vaunted military strength ( Benito Mussolini boasted that 8,000,000 bayonets would prosecute Italian claims ) : at no time have there been more than 2,500,000 men in the armed forces , and more than that number could not be equipped . <P> &gt; Of the Air Force : of 6,000 planes at the war 's outbreak , " not many more than 2.000 still exist . " New plane production is not likely to go over 400 units a month . <P> &gt; Of the Navy : " Probably one-fourth of the famous submarine fleet has been sunk . Surface vessels hug the harbors because of lack of oil , disrepair and a healthy respect for British gun power . " <P> Reporter Raymond found food in plenty in Italy-for those who could pay bootleg prices . A continuing stream of money-laden German " observers " bought everything in sight . In September alone 7,554 charges of bootlegging , hoarding and similar offenses resulted in 6,592 convictions . The Government 's reaction was to broaden the food-rationing system to include all types of meats , including entrails .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
