At St. Petersburg , the tarpon boats lay idle at their piers . Down the coast at Sarasota , merchants glumly watched the summer vacationists pack their bags and leave . The beach hot-dog stands were deserted at Indian Rocks and Pass-a-Grille ; many beach cottages were empty . Under the hot summer sun , the stench of rotting fish seeped into houses , clung to clothes . The strange phenomenon which Floridians called the " Red Tide " had come back to the Gulf Coast . <P> The Red Tide had appeared off the west coast of Florida last January ( TIME , Feb. 10 ) . Fishermen first noticed long , wavering streaks of reddish-amber smudging the blue Gulf waters . Floating in the streaks , bellies up , were thousands of dead fish . <P> By the thousands , the carcasses had washed ashore on the beaches between Boca Grande and Naples . <P> Mottled Death . The amber streaks disappeared . Then , in the middle of July , the Red Tide reappeared off Gasparilla Island . Slowly , it worked northward , dissipating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Petersburg , the Red Tide stretched in mottled patches over an area 60 miles long and 25 miles wide . As it spread , fish flopped crazily on the edges and died . Flies buzzed over their rotting carcasses on the beaches . Shore residents suffered headaches , burning throats and coughs . <P> Those who tried swimming in the infected water complained of breaking out in a rash . Strangely , no sea birds wheeled and screamed over the decaying mass . They had disappeared . <P> 60 Million to a Quart . At first , fishermen made big hauls of redfish , mullet , and grouper , which fled into the shallow bays and inlets to escape the plague . But their catches stayed in the fish houses . People did not feel like eating fish . <P> No one knew for certain what had caused the phenomenon . Dr. F. G. Walton Smith , director of the University of Miami 's Marine Laboratory , was sure it was a sudden multiplication of a new species of tiny , one-celled organisms called gymnodinium . He had found as many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red " water . The fish were killed either by a poison secreted by these organisms or as a result of their death and decay , he thought . Their sudden appearance might be explained by an increase in the phosphate content of Gulf water from phosphate plants near Tampa . <P> Property-owners manned shovels and wheelbarrows , held their noses and tried to bury the fish . Beaches were drenched with DDT . At week 's end , the Red Tide still mottled the Gulf . The only hope for suffering Floridians was that a storm would break up the amber plague or carry it somewhere else .
