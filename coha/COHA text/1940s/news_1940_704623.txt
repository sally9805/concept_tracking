txt A FINN MEETS MAKI New York Compatriot of Runner Gives Report on Interview To Sports Editor of The New York Times : Usually when an athlete rises to prominence the sports writers dig up every last fact of his past : life , but Taisto Maki , the soldier who is running for his country , is almost unknown here because the writers and Maki do n't speak the same language and his interpreters have been of the monosyllabic variety . This curious compatriot could n't find out all he wanted to know about the runner from the newspapers so he interviewed Taisto himself in Finnish . What he learned is hereby passed along to those who might be similarly curious . Taisto became an orphan when a child and had to shift for himself , which he has been doing ever since . There were no cloistered halls or formal athletic coaching for the lad who was to do some fancy stepping in later life . A Man of Many Jobs Instead he got a job tending cattle when still a child in his native village @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work as a carpenter , then drifted from one job to another until the Russian wilr found him in the office of a liquor concern in Helsinki . In his early twenties , about the time college athletes are ready ' to call it a career , Taisto decided to become a runner . He joined a group of village boys and trained in the- early morning before his working day began and again in the evening . Taisto never had a coach or any formal training until Paavo Nurmi took him in hand for the present tour . Maki was no ball of fire at the start , but in the eight or nine years he has been running he has come along nicely , as his formidable crop of world records last Summer attests . He 's 29 now and is a family man with a wife and daughter back home . He did n't make Finland 's 1936 Olympic team because he was overtrained . Not One for Heroics When the war came , Taisto went into the army immediately and was stationed in the Mannerheim Line . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about his war experiences , he shrugged and said he saw some fighting and men dying and " you . know how war is . " As far as he himself was concerned , he got fat on battles . " There . was no *chance to train at the front , " he said , adding that when General Mannerheim gave him leave to come here he weighed 162 pounds , twenty over his best running weight . He boiled off the extra poundage in a few weeks , which undoubtedly left him below his best for the competition here . Maki is getting into real condition only now , and no wonder . In the opinion of this writer , even Greg Rice is n't going to beat him if they get together outdoors . VICTOR RAUTNEN . New York , April 3 , 1940 . Streamlined Track Meets To Sports Editor of The Neto York Times : The Finnish Relief Fund track meet at Madison Square Garden Sunday night clearly demonstrated that quality , rather than quantity , of competition is the secret of a successful athletic show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with events that have no significance in themselves and serve only to dull the interest in the main attractions . I hope that next Winter we will have more track meets that are short and sweet . Mrs. JoHN SIMPSON . New York , April 4 , 1940 . Putting Teeth Into the Law To Sports Editor of The New York Times : Now that the Pari-Mutuel bill finally has become law in New York State , I hope it will be backed up by a vigorous campaign against illegal betting . Unless they are carefully watched , the bookmakers who used to operate openly . in their stalls at the track will continue . to take bets orally . But an even greater menace to the revenue-producing effect of the Pari-Mutuel bill is contained in the numerous undercover handbooks and poolrooms . These must be controlled if the full benefit of pari-mutuel betting is to be realized in New York . Perhaps some accredited agency for off-the-track betting could be established . JAMES L. SEAMAN . New York , April 2 , 1940 . LONGEVITY IN SPORTS Hoppe , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marvel ' by Reader My nomination as the sports marvel of the age is Willie Hoppe , who has been making billiard history every time he has been stepping up to the table lately in that world three-cushion championship tournament in Chicago . What competing athlete ? if a billiard player can be classed as such ? can match Hoppe 's longevity as a topnotcher ? It was way back in 1906 that Willie first came into the spotlight by winning the world 18.1 balkline title from Maurice Vignaux in Paris . He was only 18 years old then and so , of course , he became known as the " boy wonder . " Today , at 52 , he still is a " wonder . " In fact , most experts believe he is better than ever . Just think of the sports heroes who have come and gone in Hoppe 's time ! Babe Ruth , Bobby Jones , Bill Tilden , Red Grange , Jack Dempsey and Paavo Nurmi are just a few who could be mentioned . Hoppe apparently is ageless in his art . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't surprise me a bit to see him still going strong at 77 . ROBERT CAVENT . New York , April 3 , 1940 . More on " Cupid " Childs To Sports Editor of The New York Times : I dislike to plead guilty of being an old-timer and I also am not prone to engage in newspaper controversies , but recently I noticed a letter in THE TIMES from Philip Goodman referring to " Cupid " Childs and more recently one from James J. Ryan holding that Mr. Goodman was 100 per cent wrong in describing Childs as a left-handed second baseman . ? I would like to add my version , which I know is correct , by saying that each of those gentlemen was 50 per cent correct . I remember Childs very well , having seen him play numerous games in Louisville . While he was a right-handed thrower , he certainly batted from the port side . If there are any old-timers who do not agree with me , I would like to hear from them . I hope Mr. Ryan will agree that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , - I will admit that Mr. Ryan was ram per cent correct in describing Billy Greenwood as an all left-handed second baseman . FRANK H. BASSETT . M. D. Hopkinsville , Ky. , March 30 , 1940 . Baseball 's Two Periods To Sports Editor of The New York Times : I have a suggestion which I believe would be pleasing to ail baseball fans . It is that the records be divided into two separate periods ? that of the regulation ball as I and other old-timers knew it and that of the present day " rabbit " ball . In my opinion , the " rabbit " ball has spoiled baseball . Furthermore , I would like to see full credit given to the players of the pre- " rabbit " era for their feats , which were unaided by the lively ball . GEORGE A. KERRIGAN . Hudson , Mass. , March 31 , 1940 . Editorial Note : The manufacturers of the official major league baseballs still insist that no " lively ball " was inserted in the modern game and that any change , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improvement of manufacture or materials . Left Out in the Cold To Sports Editor of The New York Times : As one - of the many hockey fans in New York who gives loyal support to the local teams all Winter long , I would like to protest against our being left out in the cold for the final play-offs because Madison Square Garden is unavailable . What would the baseball fans say if the Yankees were to play the whole world series in , say , Chicago ? R. WESLEY . New York , April 3 , 1940 . Editorial Note : Or , say , Brooklyn , for the fun of it . IN PLACE OF BASEBALL Softball Held More Practical as a College Spring Sport To Sports Editor of The New York Times : This suggestion probably will be hooted unmercifully by Old Guarders , but I am undaunted by the anticipated opposition and defend my thesis on the grounds of practicality . It is very evident that baseball is a tremendous headache to the dwindling number of colleges that sponsor intercollegiate nines . The overhead expense of baseball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the college game has little gate ' appeal , so , except in a few rare cases , the sport is wholly a losing proposition . In the second place , weather conditions are such in these parts that it is a positive hardship to play baseball in April and a very uncertain proposition at best even in May . In June , when real baseball weather arrives , the colleges close . It seems rather silly for them to continue to buck the double handicap of predestined financial failure and adverse weather , so why do n't they adopt softball as their official Spring sport instead ? The cost of supporting a softball team is comparatively small and weather conditions are not so great a factor in playing it as in playing regulation baseball . Furthermore , softball has become a leading campus recreational activity and a really representative team , as distinguished from the highly selective and very often subsidized baseball ' nine , could be organized at any college . I would be very interested in getting the reaction of college people to this suggestion . PAUL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1940 . Calling All Jersey Boys To Sports Editor of The New York Times : More than 1,500 boys in Northern New Jersey alone will take to the diamonds this April to try out for various teams in the American Legion 's junior basemall program for 1940 . South Jersey 's number of applicants has not been reported as yet , but we know the total is large . This year promises to be the most active in the history of the program . If your mper sees fit to give us a little publicity in this connection we will be very grateful . We want to reach boys who are interested in our American national pastime . I would welcome a postcard or letter from any boy who wishes to learn more about the program . In towns where American Legion posts are sponsoring teams it is very likely that the program will receive publicity ; but sometimes the campaign does not get started until late in the month . Therefore , if there are any boys who wish to ' get all the necessary information in advance so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be very glad to furnish it . G. BUDD MEAD Jr .

Attention Mr. To Sports Editor of The New York Times : Here is one for the genial Mr.  --  innovator par excellence . The enjoyment of every baseball fan would be immeasurably increased if he knew exactly the distance of drives to the outfield . The custom of marking fences with the distance from home plate should be extended to marking the outfield itself , similar in a way to a gridiron , with concentric lines drawn equidistant ' from home plate . These lines need not be white , like foul lines . It would be sufficient to have merely strips of clover or dyed grass or anything distinguishable to the eye . They could be spaced at 50-foot intervals after a first or inner circle had been drawn 200 feet from home plate . Then we would learn the truth about those drives that " would have been in the stands " if they only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BEATON Jr , New York , April 2 , 1940 . Editorial Note : Putting such lines in the outfield would be another way of getting a line on the hitters.
