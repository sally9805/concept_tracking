Manhattan 's one-year-old Music Critics ' Circle last week set out to pick the winners among the year 's new U.S. compositions heard by its members . Between them , the 28 press critics in the Circle attend some 1,200 concerts a year , but obviously no one of them can get to all of Manhattan 's overlapping musical events . So Circle members first polled one another to select a program of the most promising chamber music , another program of the best orchestral works . Then , last week , they played host to themselves at two concerts , where like winetasters they sipped the new vintage and came to their verdict . <P> When the critics got together for a final vote , they ruefully agreed to hand out no prizes for new chamber music , none for any opera , ballet or choral work . Their one award was orchestral : it went to boyish William Schuman ( TIME , April 20 ) for his Third Symphony , brimful of rugged counterpoint .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
