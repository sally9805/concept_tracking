TUBERCULOSIS AND GENIUS-Lewis J. <P> Moorman - University of Chicago Press ( $2.50 ) . <P> Despite the mountain air of Parnassus , the nine Muses probably have hacking coughs . Genius and tuberculosis , as critics and physicians have long noted , occur together oftener than coincidence accounts for . Dr. Lewis Jefferson Moorman , onetime dean of the University of Oklahoma School of Medicine , takes this thesis for granted , illustrates and defines it in Tuberculosis and Genius this week . <P> Long-distance autopsies are risky . French Scholar Denis Saurat enraged the high-minded by " demonstrating " that blind John Milton ( like deaf Ludwig van Beethoven ) suffered from hereditary syphilis . Diagnostician Moorman finds Milton tuberculous . Other famous consumptives : Pope , Dr. Johnson , Shelley , Goethe , Schiller , Descartes , Balzac , Rousseau , Spinoza , Kant , Emerson , Thoreau , Whitman , Chekhov , Dostoevski , a brow-wrinkling list of other writers and thinkers . Doctors suspect that tuberculosis develops genius because 1 ) apprehension of death inspires a burning awareness of life 's beauty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an intoxicated hypersensitiveness . <P> Dr. Moorman discusses notable cases of consumptive genius-or as consumptive Katherine Mansfield called it , " the faint glitter on the plant that the frost has laid a finger on . " A year before his death in 1894 Robert Louis Stevenson wrote : " For 14 years I have not had a day 's real health ; I have wakened sick and gone to bed weary ; and I have done my work unflinchingly . I have written in bed , and written out of it , written in hemorrhages , written in sickness , written torn by coughing , written when my head swam for weakness . . . . " Yet always his work grew better , for mental activity and creative power often increase with the disease . Stevenson 's travels through Provence , U. S. mountains , the South Seas to his Samoan grave suggest not only a search for healthful air but the consumptive 's itch for vagabondage . <P> Jean Baptiste Poquelin , son of respectable parents , assumed the name " Mliere " when he joined an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mimed through the provinces , died at 51 , coughing and spitting blood , less than an hour after playing the title role in his Le Malade Imaginaire . Concludes Dr. Moorman : " Mliere rendered a great service to humanity through his satirical arraignment of the medical profession . The antiquated and extravagant practices of the Paris Faculty . . . inflamed his genius for reform . . . . Soon after Moliere 's death , Paris was leading the world in medical thought .
