txt The bill to increase the lending authority of the Export-Import Bank , now passed by the House of Representatives , is being rushed through Congress with far less clarification of its purposes than the American public is entitled to have . The report of the House committee explaining the bill , for example , filled less than a single page of type . We still do not know the exact purposes for which the new lending power is to be used . A few weeks ago it was announced that the Roosevelt Administration had " definitely and completely abandoned " the idea of creating a huge cartel to buy surplus commodities of the Western Hemisphere . As an unnamed high official rightly declared , it would be " ridiculous to thin ' - of buying up South American surpluses , because that would only encourage increased production of the same surplus commodities . " He added that this would further depress our own markets . Jesse Jones , Federal Loan Administrator , also testified on Aug. 6 : " There is no association between this plan to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take surpluses off the South American market . " These declarations , however , do not give assurance that the increased lending power of the Export-Import Bank would not be used to hold South American agricultural surpluses off the world market . There is , first of all , no restriction against this in the bill itself . The House bill does not merely increase the lending power of the bank from $200,000,000 to $700,000,000 , but it removes the previous restriction of S20,000,000 in loans to any one country . In fact it removes any restriction on loans to any one country ; so that the whole added $500,000,000 could , so far as the bill is concerned , be lent to Paraguay . And one of its explicit purposes , declared in the bill itself , is " to assist in * * the orderly marketing of the products of the countries of the Western Hemisphere by supplying funds . " Now the phrase " orderly marketing " has been used at home in recent years to justify holding an entire year 's American cotton crop off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry-overs of corn . We have no assurance that it will not be used for making possible similar efforts to peg market prices or hold off supplies of South American products . The statements of Mr. Jones with respect to this are ambiguous . In a letter made public this week he declares : While it is not contemplated that loans would be made on surplus agricultural commodities , appropriate consideration would be given to applications from some of the Governments or their central banks for loans in reasonable amounts that might enable the Government or its banks to assist their nationals in the carrying and orderly marketing of some of their agricultural surpluses , with a view to avoiding demoralized prices that would affect our own farmers . In other words , while it is not contemplated that loans would be made on surplus agricultural commodities , it is contemplated that loans would be made on surplus agricultural commodities . Such a policy , once embarked upon , could lead to limitless commitments . There is no reason why explicit limitations and safeguards can not be written into the bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense problems is essential . But there is no reason why such cooperation on our part can not be realistic . Let us not forget , for example , as the annual report of the Foreign Bondholders Protective Council has just reminded us , that of $1,610 , - 000,000 Latin-American dollar bonds outstanding , issued or guaranteed by Governments or their non-political subdivisions , 77 per cent were in default at the end of last year . Further , as some of the critics of the Export-Import Bank Bill in Congress have remarked , we can not " buy " Central and South American friendship . Great Britain tried that method of winning allies in the Balkans and it failed miserably . Such friendships last only as long as new funds continue to be poured in . Enlarged funds for the Export-Import Bank may serve a useful purpose in allowing American exporters to extend better credit terms to Latin-American buyers and in other ways . But there ought to be definite restrictions on the purposes and volume of these loans ; and greater clarification than we have yet had of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in them .
