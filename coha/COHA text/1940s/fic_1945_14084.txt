As the curtain rises on a dark stage , a deep-toned , distant bell is striking the hour of eight . On the eighth stroke an alarm clock begins its incessant clamor , and as the lights go up , slowly and dimly at center , a bed glides into view . Beside it is a night table on which are a lamp , the alarm clock , and a small radio . In the bed a girl , struggling against the rude awakening , turns and twists , then sits bolt upright . She is GEORGINA ALLERTON , young , slender , and pretty . She shakes her head and rubs her closed eyes with her fists . The alarm clock is still ringing . GEORGINA ALLERTON yawning heavily.Ohhhh ! Then , angrily , to the alarm clock . For heaven 's sake , will you please shut up ? She shuts off the alarm clock , then leans over and pulls up an imaginary window shade . The bed is flooded with morning sunlight . GEORGINA moans , shakes her head , and stretches her arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Who was it that said , " Must we have another day ? " Dorothy Parker , I suppose . I wonder if she really says all those things . With a sigh . Well , time to get up , I guess . She plumps herself down again and snuggles her head in the pillow. p. 3 LUCY ALLERTON off right. Georgina ! It 's time to get up ! GEORGINA ALLERTON calling.Yes , I know . I 've been up for hours ! Indignantly . Goodness , you 'd think sleep was some sort of a crime . Gloomily , as she looks toward the window . Yes , another day . And what a day ! Beautiful sunshine . Not a cloud in the sky . How wonderful it must be to be able to enjoy it . She sighs , then says firmly . Well , come on , Georgina , snap out of it , and get yourself up out of bed ! She switches on the radio and an orchestra is heard softly playing " Paris in the Spring . " I wonder how long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychosis or something . For all I know , I may have a psychosis already . Good grief , what a thought ! I wish I could remember that awful nightmare I had last night . Still , they say it 's awfully hard to make anything out of your own dreams . That damned little psychic censor gets in your way . And besides , I really do n't know very much about dream symbols . Just the obvious ones , like Maypoles and church steeples  --  and I never seem to dream about them . Oh , well , to hell with it ! She throws back the covers , swings her legs out of bed , and gets into her slippers and negligee . The music stops , and the voice of a radio announcer is heard. p. 4 ANNOUNCER 'S VOICE And so we bring to a close our half-hour of recorded music . And friends , do n't forget your date tonight at eight-thirty , with your counselor on human relations , Dr. J. Gilmore Percival , brought to you through the courtesy of Kellogg 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are worried about some emotional problem , come and tell your troubles to Dr. Percival , whose wise and kindly counsel has helped hundreds to solve  --   --  GEORGINA ALLERTON switching off the radio indignantly.How ridiculous ! As though that little quack could really solve people 's emotional problems for them ! Still , I suppose the poor deluded people who go to him get a kind of relief just from spilling their troubles to somebody . After all , that 's what psychiatry is  --  only on a scientific basis , of course . She sits musing on the bed , her chin in her palm . Maybe I should try psychiatry . Only what 's the use when I know so well what 's the matter with me ? Except that the right psychiatrist might help me to forget Jim . But do I want to forget Jim ? And suppose it is n't just Jim that 's the matter with me ! What if it all goes back to something that 's lurking deep in my unconscious , quietly festering away ? Sharply . How absurd ! In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ besides , what do I need a psychiatrist for ? I 'm a perfectly healthy , normal person . All that 's the matter with me is that I 'm in love with the wrong man . But that 's plenty ! Anyhow , how do I know I 'm really normal ? Is anybody ? Angrily . Honestly , it 's disgraceful that they allow charlatans like that Dr. Percival on the air ! Imagine standing up in front of a microphone and revealing the things that  --   --  As she sits musing , the radio lights up again and the vioce of the ANNOUNCER is heard. p. 5 ANNOUNCER 'S VOICE And remember , folks , it 's the kidneys that are the key to your health . And now here is Dr. Percival . PERCIVAL 'S VOICE Good evening , friends . Tonight we begin with the problem of Miss G. A. Now , miss , just step right up to the microphone and tell me what is troubling you . GEORGINA ALLERTON picking up the bedside lamp and speaking low into it , as though it were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ louder , please , so that we can all hear you . There 's nothing to be nervous about . GEORGINA ALLERTON I 'm not nervous . It 's just  --  well , it 's just that it 's a little hard to discuss your personal problems with several million people listening in . PERCIVAL 'S VOICE I ca n't help you , unless you  --  GEORGINA ALLERTON I know . Well , you see , I 'm in love with a man named Jim  --  PERCIVAL 'S VOICE No names , please ! No one 's identity is ever revealed on this program . GEORGINA ALLERTON Oh , I 'm sorry ! I  --  PERCIVAL 'S VOICE Go on , please . You are in love with a man named J. And he does not reciprocate your feeling for him , is that it ? p. 6 GEORGINA ALLERTON Oh , that 's not the point ! It 's that he  --   --  he  --  PERCIVAL 'S VOICE Well , what ? GEORGINA ALLERTON Well , he happens to be my brother-in-law . PERCIVAL 'S VOICE One moment , please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in love with your brother-in-law ? GEORGINA ALLERTON Yes . Yes , I am . I have been , for years and years . PERCIVAL 'S VOICE This is really quite an extraordinary case . And , if I understand you correctly , he is not in love with you . GEORGINA ALLERTON Well , I used to think he was . And then suddenly he married Miriam and  --   --  PERCIVAL 'S VOICE No names , please ! GEORGINA ALLERTON Sorry ! He married my sister , two years ago , and that was just about the end of everything for me . PERCIVAL 'S VOICE And is he aware of your feeling for him ? GEORGINA ALLERTON indignantly.Certainly not ! What kind of a girl do you think I am ? Why , I 'd die rather than let him know . Nobody knows or even suspects . Weepily . But I just ca n't keep it bottled up any longer . That 's why I thought I 'd  --   --  p. 7 PERCIVAL 'S VOICE Yes . You have a feeling of guilt about it , have n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Being in love with your own brother-in-law  --  well , it seems just a little  --  a little incestuous . PERCIVAL 'S VOICE hastily.One moment , Miss A. That is not a word that is acceptable on the air . GEORGINA ALLERTON I 'm terribly sorry , I  --   --  PERCIVAL 'S VOICE Well , young woman , if you want my advice , you 'll put this brother-in-law completely out of your mind and  --   --  GEORGINA ALLERTON Yes , that 's easy to say . I 've tried and tried . In fact , there 's a man I 'm having lunch with , a Mr.  --   --  PERCIVAL 'S VOICE Careful ! GEORGINA ALLERTON Well , I 've been careful , up to now . Oh , you mean about his name . Well , he 's a Mr. H. PERCIVAL 'S VOICE And this Mr. H. is interested in you ? GEORGINA ALLERTON Well , when a man keeps asking a girl out all the time  --  especially a married man  --   --  PERCIVAL 'S VOICE Your involvements seem to be exclusively with married men . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss A. , I think your situation is a very serious one , indeed . It is hard for me  --   --  LUCY ALLERTON off right. Georgina ! Are you daydreaming again in there ? It 's almost nine ! GEORGINA ALLERTON leaping up.All right , Mother . I 'm practically dressed . The lights fade on the scene and come up , at the left , on GEORGINA 's bathroom , which she enters , talking all the while . Maybe your mother is right , Georgina . Maybe it 's time you cut out the daydreaming  --  time you stopped mooning around and imagining yourself to be this extraordinary creature with a strange and fascinating psychological life . She has removed her negligee and donned a bathing cap ; and she now goes around behind the bathroom , invisible but still audible . The sound of a shower is heard . Oh , damn it ! Cold as ice ! There , that 's better ! She sings " Night and Day " lustily . Then the shower is turned off , and she reappears wrapped in a large bath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubbing herself vigorously . Still , to be honest , I must admit that , compared to the average girl you meet , I 'm really quite complex . Intelligent and well informed too ; and a good conversationalist . Indignantly , as over her shoulder , she sees someone looking in at her . Well , for heaven 's sake ! Honestly , some people ! She pulls down an imaginary window shade and the scene is blacked out , her voice coming out of the darkness . And my looks are nothing to be ashamed of either . I have a neat little figure and my legs are really very nice . Of course , my nose is sort of funny , but my face definitely has character  --  not just one of those magazine-cover deadpans . With a yawn . Oh , I never seem to get enough sleep ! The lights come up as she raises the imaginary shade . She is dressed now in her shoes , stockings , and slip . She seats herself at her dressing table , facing the audience , and brushes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for hours , dreaming up all the exciting things that could happen but never do . Well , maybe this is the day when things really will begin to happen to me . Maybe Wentworth and Jones will accept my novel . They 've had it over a month now , and all the other publishers turned it down in less than two weeks . It certainly looks promising . And especially with Jim 's recommendation . Would n't that be wonderful ! With a published novel , I 'd really be somebody . Reviews in all the book sections ; royalty checks coming in ; women nudging each other at Schrafft 's and whispering , " Do n't look now , but that girl over there  --  the one with the smart hat  --  that 's Georgina Allerton , the novelist . " Going to the washbasin . Gee , that would be thrilling ! To feel that I 'd accomplished something . To feel that I had a purpose in life . To feel that  --   --  She busies herself with a toothbrush , becoming momentarily unintelligible . Ubble-ba-glub-ab-lub-mum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Going back to the dressing table . Fifty novels would n't make up for Jim . If Miriam only appreciated him . But she does n't . She does n't understand him . All his fine sensitive qualities  --  they 're completely lost on her . It 's really ironic . Baring her teeth . Gosh , my teeth could certainly stand a good cleaning . It 's awful the way I put off going to the dentist . Maybe that 's psychopathic too . What to do ? What to do ? Here I am twenty-three years old  --  no , let 's face it , twenty-four next month ! And that 's practically thirty . Thirty years old  --  and nothing to show for it . Suppose nothing ever does happen to me . That 's a frightening thought ! Just to go on and on like this , on through middle age , on to senility , never experiencing anything  --  what a prospect ! Putting on her make-up . Of course I suppose that up to a certain point there 's nothing abnormal about virginity . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have n't passed that point ? Heavens , is that a gray hair ? No , thank goodness . What a scare ! Still , there must be a lot of women who go right on being virgins until the very day they die . It can be done , I guess . Does n't sound like much fun though . She rises and gets into her dress . Well , that brings me right smack back to George Hand . Maybe I should n't have accepted his invitation for today . He really is rushing me . Of course , he may not have any intentions at all . No , he 's too busy a man to keep on dating up a girl , without having something on his mind . So that puts it squarely up to me . Well , anyhow , if I 'm going to play with fire , I may as well look my best . So here goes . p. 9 LUCY ALLERTON off right. Georgina , I 'm getting tired of keeping the coffee hot . GEORGINA ALLERTON Coming ! Coming ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the bathroom and comes up at the right on a breakfast table at which her parents are seated . MRS . ALLERTON is a stoutish , good-looking woman in a negligee ; MR . ALLERTON is a pleasant round-faced man in a business suit . He is busy with the morning 's mail . Briskly , as she takes her place at the table . Morning , Mother . Morning , Dad . GEORGE ALLERTON looking up from the letter he is reading.Oh , good morning , Georgie . LUCY ALLERTON Do n't tell me you 're wearing that new dress to work . GEORGINA ALLERTON I have a lunch date . LUCY ALLERTON with lively interest.Oh ? GEORGINA ALLERTON No , Mother , he is not a matrimonial prospect.We just happen to be going to a swanky place so  --   --  LUCY ALLERTON I did n't say  --  I did n't say  --  suppressing a sneeze.  --  a single  --  solitary  --  word . The sneeze bursts forth . Excuse me ! p. 10 GEORGINA ALLERTON Goodness , Mother , have you got a cold ? LUCY ALLERTON Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ALLERTON I told you not to put your fur coat in storage yet . LUCY ALLERTON sharply.That has nothing  --  nothing whatever  --  nothing whatever to do with it . Another sneeze . Oh , damn it ! I hate colds . GEORGINA ALLERTON Some aspirin might do it good . LUCY ALLERTON Nothing does a cold any good . And if you want to know how I got it , I got it from sleeping next to an open window . Your father , after consulting the calendar , decided that spring is here , so of course up went the window all the way . GEORGE ALLERTON mildly.I offered to change beds with you , Lucy . LUCY ALLERTON That would have only meant your getting a cold , and I 'd have not only had to nurse you but would have caught it myself . It was much simpler to catch my own cold in the first place . GEORGINA ALLERTON pouring herself some coffee.But why did n't you close the window ? p. 11 LUCY ALLERTON Well , we discussed the pros and cons of that at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father 's second rebuttal , I fell asleep , with the result that  --   --  A sneeze . GEORGE ALLERTON Some butter , Georgie ? GEORGINA ALLERTON Dad , are n't you ever going to learn that I do n't take butter ? LUCY ALLERTON How can you swallow that dry toast ? GEORGINA ALLERTON You get used to it . LUCY ALLERTON I would never get used to it . Has it ever occurred to you that if nature had intended our skeletons to be visible it would have put them  --  on the outside  --  on the outside of our bodies ? A sneeze . GEORGE ALLERTON Oh , there 's a letter for you , Georgie . He hands it to her . GEORGINA ALLERTON From Wentworth and Jones ! She tears it open eagerly , then registers deep disappointment . Oh , damn ! They 've turned down my novel . GEORGE ALLERTON Too bad ! But you must n't be discouraged . GEORGINA ALLERTON Well , I am ! I was sure they were going to accept it . Especially after Jim recommended it for publication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason for turning it down . GEORGINA ALLERTON I do n't see why you 're always picking on poor Jim . LUCY ALLERTON Well , I 'm fed up with poor Jim . I think a fellow his age should n't just be sitting around reading manuscripts at thirty-five dollars a week . GEORGE ALLERTON Oh , give the boy a chance , my dear . He has n't found himself yet . GEORGINA ALLERTON That 's exactly it ! LUCY ALLERTON Well , I 'm sick and tired of financing the search . First , I had to see him through law school . Then  --   --  GEORGINA ALLERTON Do n't go all over that again , Mother . Just because he 's too sensitive to bring himself  --  GEORGE ALLERTON Yes . Law , as it 's practiced today , is hardly the profession for an idealist . LUCY ALLERTON Well , you should know ! What is this case you 're going to Washington on ? GEORGE ALLERTON It 's the Sons of Solomon case . GEORGINA ALLERTON Who are they , Dad ? GEORGE ALLERTON A religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 've lost all along the line , but I 'm very hopeful of winning in the Supreme Court . p. 13 LUCY ALLERTON And that will mean a whopping fee , I 'm sure . GEORGE ALLERTON rising . No fee at all , win or lose . I 'm handling the case as a matter of principle . Free speech , freedom of religion . GEORGINA ALLERTON But , Dad , do you believe in polygamy ? GEORGE ALLERTON Personally speaking , no . LUCY ALLERTON And a lot of good it would do him if he did ! GEORGE ALLERTON But I can say with Voltaire : I disapprove of what you say , but I will defend to the death your right to say it . GEORGINA ALLERTON Oh , did Voltaire say that ? LUCY ALLERTON interrupting.George , does n't anybody ever walk into your office who 's been run over by a millionaire 's limousine or who 's robbed a bank and is willing to give you  --  to give you half  --  to get him  --  get him out of it ? A sneeze . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambulancechasers and police-court shysters without Dad becoming one ? GEORGE ALLERTON Thank you , Georgie . He kisses her . Good-by , dear . About to kiss MRS . ALLERTON . Good-by , Lucy . p. 14 LUCY ALLERTON drawing back.Do n't kiss me , or you 'll have the entire Supreme Court sneezing their heads off . GEORGE ALLERTON solicitously.I 'm worried about you . Maybe a little aspirin  --   --  LUCY ALLERTON If aspirin is mentioned again  --  I 'll  --  I 'll  --  I 'll  --  A sneeze . Sometimes I think that even monogamy is going too far . GEORGE ALLERTON I 'll be back late tonight . Do n't be downcast about the novel , Georgie . These things take time . GEORGINA ALLERTON Yes , it certainly looks that way . ALLERTON exits . LUCY ALLERTON Do you have to encourage him ? GEORGINA ALLERTON Well , I admire him for sticking unselfishly to his principles , instead of just practicing law on a sordid , commercial basis . LUCY ALLERTON Yes , there is certainly no taint of commercialism upon this family , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coincidence that I am able to foot the bills on the income from Grandpa 's sordid commercial estate . GEORGINA ALLERTON Well , I have every intention of contributing my share , just as soon as  --   --  MRS . ALLERTON sneezes. p. 15 LUCY ALLERTON Excuse me . How much did the bookshop lose last month ? GEORGINA ALLERTON Only a hundred and eighteen dollars . Claire says it 's the best month we 've had yet . LUCY ALLERTON rising.Why , you 're right on the highroad to success . She sneezes . Well , I 'm going to go and suffer in solitude . GEORGINA ALLERTON Good-by , Mother . I do hope  --   --  MRS . ALLERTON has gone off right . GEORGINA sighs as MIRIAM LUCAS , a young attractive woman , enters at left . MIRIAM ALLERTON LUCAS ' Lo , Sis . GEORGINA ALLERTON Why , Miriam ! MIRIAM ALLERTON LUCAS Why , look at you , all dressed up to kill . GEORGINA ALLERTON Well , I 'm lunching at the Canard Rouge , so I thought I 'd  --   --  MIRIAM ALLERTON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somebody who 's in the book trade . Since when do you get up at daybreak ? MIRIAM ALLERTON LUCAS I had a date with a doctor . Where are Mother and Dad ? p. 16 GEORGINA ALLERTON Dad 's gone to Washington , and Mother 's got an awful cold . MIRIAM ALLERTON LUCAS That 's good . I mean , I 'd rather not spring this on the whole family at once . I hate collective reactions . GEORGINA ALLERTON Is anything wrong ? MIRIAM ALLERTON LUCAS That 's a matter of opinion . It seems that the old medico went into a huddle with some mouse or rabbit that he keeps around and they 've decided that you 're about to become an aunt . GEORGINA ALLERTON But , Miriam , how exciting ! When 's it going to be ? MIRIAM ALLERTON LUCAS Oh , not for a hell of a while  --  a good five or six months . All those engineers , with their blueprints , knocking hours off the transcontinental flying time , but not one day do they save us mothers . Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mother . GEORGINA ALLERTON I 'll bet Jim is happy about it . MIRIAM ALLERTON LUCAS He does n't know it yet . I saw no point in getting him into an interesting condition until I was really sure myself . Vehemently . And to come right out with it , I do n't care a hoot whether he 's happy about it or not . GEORGINA ALLERTON greatly embarrassed.Well , I know it 's going to make all the difference in the world for you both . Gee , I certainly envy you . p. 17 MIRIAM ALLERTON LUCAS And may I say that I certainly envy you . Here am I , a seething mass of unpleasant symptoms , and there are you , fit as a fiddle , and positively suffused with the soft glow of vicarious maternity . GEORGINA ALLERTON I just wish I could change places with you , that 's all . MIRIAM ALLERTON LUCAS It 's a deal . I 'll send my agent around after lunch . And I hope you have a boy . GEORGINA ALLERTON Maybe it 'll be twins . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You never know who 's listening . She exits at right . GEORGINA sits looking dreamily after MIRIAM . Then , as the light fades on the scene , a chorus of female voices sings " Sleep , Baby , Sleep . " The stage is in darkness for a few moments , then the singing dies out and merges into a chorus of wailing infants . The lights come up slowly at the center , revealing a hospital bed , completely surrounded by flowers , in which GEORGINA sits propped up . She wears a silk jacket and holds a large doll in each arm , one wrapped in a blue blanket , the other in pink . At one side of the bed stands an OBSTETRICIAN , who looks like ALLERTON ; at the other side , a NURSE , who looks like MRS . ALLERTON . OBSTETRICIAN Well , my dear , you 've come through wonderfully . p. 18 GEORGINA ALLERTON All thanks to you , Doctor . You 've been like a father to me . OBSTETRICIAN In all my years , I 've never known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're a plucky little woman . GEORGINA ALLERTON A lucky one , you mean ! Smiling down at the babies . Just look at my little darlings ! OBSTETRICIAN I 've never seen two finer ones . NURSE You 're the envy of every mother in the hospital . GEORGINA ALLERTON beaming.Well , what 's a little suffering compared to that ? Besides , pain is a part of life , and to live fully we must taste every form of human experience . NURSE Oh , that 's beautifully expressed ! GEORGINA ALLERTON And , Doctor , I definitely do n't want them to go on the bottle . It 's such a joy ! OBSTETRICIAN patting her head.Good girl ! As the OBSTETRICIAN exits , JIM LUCAS enters . He is an attractive young man with a face and manner that are almost too sensitive . JIM LUCAS Georgina , darling ! p. 19 GEORGINA ALLERTON Oh , Jim ! NURSE Not too long , Mr. Lucas . We must n't tire her . JIM LUCAS No , no . I understand . As the NURSE exits he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't it wonderful ? JIM LUCAS Yes , wonderful ! Birth , the most universal experience , and yet the greatest of all miracles . Are you happy , darling ? GEORGINA ALLERTON Just look at me ! I 've waited so long for this , afraid it was never going to happen . I 'm a new woman , Jim . JIM LUCAS And I 'm a new man  --  with someone to understand me , someone to have faith in me . GEORGINA ALLERTON And a new world to build for ourselves  --  and for them : Gerald and Geraldine . MIRIAM ALLERTON LUCAS entering at right , smoking a cigarette.Hand them over quick , Georgina . I 'm parked in front of a fire plug . GEORGINA ALLERTON clinging to the babies.No , you sha n't have them ! They 're mine . MIRIAM ALLERTON LUCAS coming to the bed.Yours ? Look , darling , it was n't my idea to have a baby ! But having produced a couple of brats in the customary , antiquated manner , I do n't think I 'm unreasonable in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only in the crudest physiological sense . MIRIAM ALLERTON LUCAS Oh , forgive me ! Is there some other sense ? GEORGINA ALLERTON There is indeed ! JIM LUCAS You would n't have to be told that , Miriam , if you had any feeling for the deeper values of life . There 's no real marriage between you and me  --  no love , no understanding , no spiritual communion . The children of my body may be yours , but the children of my spirit will always be Georgina 's . MIRIAM ALLERTON LUCAS All right . I 'll settle for that . Calling . Nurse ! NURSE Coming ! MIRIAM ALLERTON LUCAS snatching one baby and pointing to the other.Here , you take that one . And hurry up before I get a ticket . The NURSE takes the other baby from GEORGINA and follows MIRIAM off , sneezing into the baby 's face . MIRIAM ALLERTON LUCAS as she exits.And watch that sneezing ! JIM LUCAS taking a step after her.Miriam , I  --   --  GEORGINA ALLERTON as the scene fades out.Jim ! Jim ! Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JIM LUCAS stretching his arms toward the disappearing GEORGINA.I 'm sorry , Georgina ! I know it is n't right ! I know it should n't be this way ! Georgina ! Georgina ! Georgina ! He exits . LUCY ALLERTON off right. Georgina ! Georgina , are you still there ? The lights come up right on GEORGINA as she sits at the breakfast table , as before . GEORGINA ALLERTON startled.What ? Yes . Yes , I am . She hastily wipes her eyes as MRS . ALLERTON enters . LUCY ALLERTON You 'll be late again at the shop . What on earth are you moping about now ? GEORGINA ALLERTON Just happy about Miriam . And a little wistful at the prospect of being a maiden aunt . Do n't you feel sort of  --   --  LUCY ALLERTON I 'm much too furious to feel sort of anything . GEORGINA ALLERTON Why ? What 's the matter ? LUCY ALLERTON Did n't Miriam tell you about Jim ? GEORGINA ALLERTON anxiously.No , what about him ? p. 22 LUCY ALLERTON He 's out of a job again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ALLERTON Well , that 's one way of putting it . In less diplomatic language , they fired him . GEORGINA ALLERTON So that 's why she was so upset . Poor Jim ! LUCY ALLERTON What do you mean , poor Jim ! What about poor Miriam ? GEORGINA ALLERTON It 's much worse for him . He 's just had nothing but hard luck . LUCY ALLERTON Why , the way you stand up for him , anybody would think you were madly in love with him . GEORGINA ALLERTON angrily.Do n't talk such nonsense ! Just because I happen to feel some sympathy for a boy who  --   --  LUCY ALLERTON All right , you can feel all the sympathy you like for him . But , in my opinion , the sooner Miriam gets herself , unattached from that balmy dreamer , the better off she 'll be . GEORGINA ALLERTON Well , I hope you do n't tell her anything like that . LUCY ALLERTON I just this minute  --  just this minute  --  finished telling her ! A sneeze. p. 23 GEORGINA ALLERTON How could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby ? LUCY ALLERTON That 's just exactly it . She 'd be a fool to hang on to him , now that he 's accomplished what will probably be the only affirmative act of his life . GEORGINA ALLERTON But it 's just the time when a woman needs her husband most ! LUCY ALLERTON You read too many serious books . What on earth does she need him for now ? GEORGINA ALLERTON I do n't see how you can be so cynical about your daughter 's happiness . LUCY ALLERTON I 'm not the least bit cynical . If she gets rid of that piece of excess baggage , she has a chance to make a fresh start . Otherwise , she 's just stuck with him . Everybody else seems to fire him . Why should n't she ? GEORGINA ALLERTON Well , I trust and pray that Miriam wo n't pay any attention to you . In fact , I 'm going to call her up and tell her so . LUCY ALLERTON You keep out of this . If Miriam had wanted your advice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unemployed Galahad comes crying to you , I wish you 'd tell him for me that  --   --  that  --   --  that  --  She sneezes . For goodness ' sake , will you run along to work now , before I use language unbecoming a grandmother ? p. 24 GEORGINA ALLERTON All right , good-by , then . And , for heaven 's sake , take care of yourself . LUCY ALLERTON as GEORGINA exits.If you  --  if I  --  if anybody  --   --  The lights fade on the scene and come up , at the left , on a corner of a small bookshop . The telephone is ringing . On the third ring CLAIRE BLAKELY , a brisk young woman about GEORGINA 's age , enters and answers it . CLAIRE BLAKELY Mermaid Bookshop . No , madam , I 'm terribly sorry . This is not the Bide-a-wee Home . You must have the wrong number . A stout woman enters and CLAIRE turns to her . Good morning . Can I help you ? WOMAN I was just wondering if you happen to have a copy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not at the moment . WOMAN Oh , dear . This is about the fifth shop I 've been to . CLAIRE BLAKELY We have a dozen copies but they 're all out . And a waiting list of at least fifty . But here 's something you might like . Mary Myrtle Miven 's latest , My Heart Is Like a Trumpet . It 's a sort of idyllic love story about two horses . Very tender and poetic . p. 25 WOMAN No , I really do n't think  --   --  CLAIRE BLAKELY Well , how about The Dnieper Goes Rolling Along ? It 's that new Soviet novel about the electrification of collective farms . Very stark and powerful . WOMAN No , what I really want is Always Opal . You see , all my friends are reading it , and I feel so out of it . I understand it 's very  --   --  very  --   --  CLAIRE BLAKELY Well , it certainly does n't leave much to the imagination in the way of  --   --  WOMAN Yes , so I understand . As she starts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have a three-cent stamp . CLAIRE BLAKELY Yes , I think so . She opens a tin cashbox. on the desk . WOMAN fumbling in her handbag.Oh , dear , I 'm afraid the smallest I have is a five-dollar bill . Could you possibly  --   --  ? CLAIRE BLAKELY I guess I can make it . One , and four is five . WOMAN Oh , thank you so much . CLAIRE BLAKELY Not a bit . Stop in again . WOMAN Indeed I will ! She goes out at the right as GEORGINA enters p. 26 GEORGINA ALLERTON Hello , Claire . Sorry I 'm late again . Have you had a busy morning ? CLAIRE BLAKELY You betcha . I directed two people to Oppenheim Collins , one gal wanted to look at the phone book , another had to go to the john , and I just made a cash sale of a three-cent stamp . GEORGINA ALLERTON It 's discouraging . CLAIRE BLAKELY Oh , I knew there was something else . Frank McClellan called up to say that that asthma of his has got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Arizona , pronto . GEORGINA ALLERTON Oh , the poor guy ! But what about his bookshop ? CLAIRE BLAKELY Well , he thought we might like to take it over . GEORGINA ALLERTON excitedly.But , Claire , how wonderful ! Why , compared to this dinky little  --   --  CLAIRE BLAKELY You can spare me the comparison . He says he clears five or six hundred a month . GEORGINA ALLERTON Why , we lost nearly that much one month . CLAIRE BLAKELY Yes , dear . GEORGINA ALLERTON Well , let 's tell him yes , before he changes his mind . p. 27 CLAIRE BLAKELY He wants ten thousand dollars for the business . GEORGINA ALLERTON Ten thousand dollars ! For heaven 's sake ! CLAIRE BLAKELY Did you think he wanted to make us a present of it ? You do n't happen to know where we could dig up ten thousand , do you ? GEORGINA ALLERTON Who , me ? CLAIRE BLAKELY No , I guess not . Well , it 's too bad . With firmness . Georgie , I do n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think the best thing for us to do is board up this hole in the wall and call it a day . GEORGINA ALLERTON What , give up the business , when we 've put so much into it ? CLAIRE BLAKELY We could have had sables on what we 've put into it . GEORGINA ALLERTON But we 're not interested in sables . CLAIRE BLAKELY We 're not ? GEORGINA ALLERTON Well , what I mean is , we 're not the frivolous type that 's willing just to gad around and fritter our time away . CLAIRE BLAKELY But what type are we ? And what are we good for ? What can we do ? GEORGINA ALLERTON Well , we could go to secretarial school . p. 28 CLAIRE BLAKELY Back to school at twenty-four ? Listen , darling , beginning with play school at three , I went to school  --  let me see now  --  sixteen , seventeen , eighteen , nineteen  --   --  ! My God , nineteen consecutive years ! Nineteen years , thousands of dollars , and the efforts of hundreds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to do all the useful things we do n't know how to do . GEORGINA ALLERTON And I 'm getting terribly discouraged about my novel too . Wentworth and Jones have just turned it down . And after Jim Lucas recommended it . I 'm beginning to think that maybe I 'm not a novelist . CLAIRE BLAKELY Oh , do n't take that attitude . William DeMorgan had his first novel published at sixty-six . GEORGINA ALLERTON But he must have had something to keep him occupied in the meantime . I still have one teeny hope . Jim Lucas said he 'd give the manuscript to Clark Redfield . You know  --  the book reviewer . CLAIRE BLAKELY Oh , yes . GEORGINA ALLERTON If he turns thumbs down , I 'll just  --   --  ! Oh , well , no use brooding over it . By the way , speaking of Jim Lucas , Miriam is going to have a baby . CLAIRE BLAKELY Congratulations ! Well , that 's something that even we would be capable of , I suppose . p. 29 GEORGINA ALLERTON They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the hell of it . We 're choosy too . Well , let 's not be defeatist about things . Ca n't you think of some way we could raise that ten thousand ? How about your grandfather 's estate ? It 's a perfectly safe investment  --   --  GEORGINA ALLERTON Not a chance of that . It 's all tied up in a trust fund with some bank , as long as my mother lives . CLAIRE BLAKELY And I suppose she 's good for another twenty-five years . GEORGINA ALLERTON Why , what a thing to say ! CLAIRE BLAKELY Oh , I did n't mean it that way . It 's just that  --  oh , you know  --  always some dead hand , holding us back . Oh , well , I 've got to get out this month 's bills . She starts to go . Do n't take any more reservations for Always Opal . Our lease will be up by the time we fill all we have now . She exits behind the bookshelves . GEORGINA sighs , lights a cigarette , gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Suddenly the telephone rings . GEORGINA ALLERTON without going near the telephone.Hello ? Yes , this is she . What ? Oh , no , I ca n't believe it ! Yes ! Yes ! I 'll be right there . As she hurries to the center , the lights come up , revealing a MAN in a surgeon 's uniform with a stethoscope about his neck . Oh , Doctor , Doctor , it ca n't be true about my mother ! p. 30 DOCTOR Yes , my dear , I 'm afraid it is . GEORGINA ALLERTON What was it  --  her heart ? DOCTOR That  --  and other things . It happens that way sometimes . We tried to save her , but it was hopeless . GEORGINA ALLERTON Did you try sodium pentathol ? DOCTOR Yes , my dear . Everything was done that medical science can do . But there are still some things we have n't mastered . And now I shall leave you with your father . He needs you , my dear . He recedes into the darkness as ALLERTON comes forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm all alone now , Georgie  --  except for you ! GEORGINA ALLERTON You have Miriam too , Dad . GEORGE ALLERTON shaking his head.She has Jim to look out for . And a baby coming soon . So there 's only you . GEORGINA ALLERTON You can depend on me , Dad . I 'll never leave you . You 're all I have in the world too . GEORGE ALLERTON You 're a rich girl now , Georgie . Anything that your heart desires  --   --  p. 31 GEORGINA ALLERTON I do n't care about the money , Dad . If I do use any of it , it will only be so that Claire and I  --   --  CLARK REDFIELD , a young man of twenty-eight , enters at the left . He staggers under the load of a double armful of books . He goes to the desk , plumps down the books , looks toward the center , and coughs tentatively . As GEORGINA turns and sees him the lights fade quickly on ALLERTON . CLARK REDFIELD Good morning , Miss Allerton . GEORGINA ALLERTON approaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You seem preoccupied . I hope I have n't derailed some train of cosmic thought . GEORGINA ALLERTON somewhat flustered.Of course not . I was just  --   --  Seeing the books . Goodness ! More review copies ? CLARK REDFIELD You betcha ! I 've got  --   --  GEORGINA ALLERTON preoccupied.Do you mind waiting a minute while I call my mother ? She was n't feeling well this morning and  --   --  CLARK REDFIELD Nothing serious , I hope ! p. 32 GEORGINA ALLERTON Well , I think it 's only a cold , but you know how these respiratory disorders flare up sometimes . She dials a number . A telephone rings at the right and the lights go up on MRS . ALLERTON . She is seated on a chaise longue , dressed as before , and reading a book . The telephone is beside her and she answers it . LUCY ALLERTON Hello ! GEORGINA ALLERTON This is me , Mother . How are you feeling ? LUCY ALLERTON What do you mean , how am I feeling ? I 'm feeling  --  feeling fine . She sneezes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got a cold in the head and every now and then  --  I  --  I  --  I  --  have to sneeze . What are you calling up for ? GEORGINA ALLERTON To find out how you are , of course . I 've been worried about you . LUCY ALLERTON You mean to say you called up just to ask about my sneezes ? You certainly must have very little on your mind . GEORGINA ALLERTON Well , you might at least appreciate my  --   --  LUCY ALLERTON I was appreciating Opal 's hot affair with Monseigneur de Montrouget and you interrupted me just as they were about to  --   --  to  --   --  She sneezes and hangs up. p. 33 GEORGINA ALLERTON as the lights fade on MRS . ALLERTON.All right . I 'm just glad you  --   --  She hangs up . CLARK REDFIELD Is she all right ? GEORGINA ALLERTON She seems all right . Just sneezing and very cranky . CLARK REDFIELD The typical American mother . Rubbing his hands . Well , are you ready to do business now ? GEORGINA ALLERTON What have you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whodunits , a couple of epics of the soil , a survey of the natural resources of Bolivia , and a volume called Fun with a Chafing Dish . And here is the prize of the lot : Professor Oglethorpe 's two-volume Life of Napoleon , with the pages still uncut . GEORGINA ALLERTON You mean you have n't read it ? CLARK REDFIELD Do I look like a boy who , six years out of college , would wade through eleven hundred pages on Napoleon ? GEORGINA ALLERTON But I read your review of it in the Globe . CLARK REDFIELD I did n't say I did n't review it . I said I did n't read it . p. 34 GEORGINA ALLERTON How could you review it without reading it ? CLARK REDFIELD Easy . First I quoted liberally from the introduction and quarreled with the author 's approach . Next , I leafed quickly through and called attention to three typographical errors . Then I praised the illustrations , grumbled about the footnotes , and intimated that the book added little to what had already been written . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty-seven minutes . GEORGINA ALLERTON Is that your idea of literary criticism ? CLARK REDFIELD Look , I 'm a working newspaperman and a member of the Newspaper Guild , whose contract guarantees me a minimum wage for a maximum working week . There 's nothing in it that requires me to ruin my eyesight and addle my brain in the interests of a Corsican upstart . GEORGINA ALLERTON Well , I 've often heard that newspapermen are cynical , but I would n't have believed that a man who is entrusted with reviewing books could have so little sense of responsibility . CLARK REDFIELD You make me feel like a great big brute . GEORGINA ALLERTON I do n't see anything funny about it . I think it 's disgraceful . CLARK REDFIELD Do n't twist the sword , Miss Allerton . Just give me the price of my shame and let me go in peace . Well , what do you say ? How much am I bid for the lot ? p. 35 GEORGINA ALLERTON examining the books.Most of these are n't much use to us . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you drive a hard bargain . But I 'm not going to lug these damned things any further , so they 're yours . GEORGINA ALLERTON Well , I do n't want you to feel I 'm taking advantage of you . I 'll make it six dollars . CLARK REDFIELD holding up his hand.No , no ! Even a cynical newspaperman has his pride . Give ! GEORGINA ALLERTON handing him a bill.You do n't have to be so sarcastic about it . We really do n't need your secondhand books . Maybe , hereafter , you 'd better take them somewhere else . CLARK REDFIELD Unfortunately , I 'm a creature of habit , Miss Allerton . Let me but tuck a review copy under my arm , and immediately there is set in motion a whole series of muscular reflexes that takes me straight to your door . GEORGINA ALLERTON If reviewing books is so distasteful to you , why do you do it ? CLARK REDFIELD Well , you see , I have a periodic rendezvous with my stomach . And I find that reviewing books requires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not to withhold anything from you , I 'm sitting in a very pretty spot for the first opening on the sports page . p. 36 GEORGINA ALLERTON in amazement.You mean you 'd rather be a sportswriter than a literary critic ? CLARK REDFIELD I 'm afraid you do n't grasp the practical realities of journalism . What you euphemistically call a literary critic is only a miserable penny-a-liner , whereas a sportswriter nestles snugly in the upper brackets . GEORGINA ALLERTON I was n't thinking about the money  --   --  CLARK REDFIELD Pardon the indelicacy . So you think that writing about books is on a higher level than writing about sports ? GEORGINA ALLERTON I just think there 's no comparison . CLARK REDFIELD You 're right ; there is n't . Any young squirt , fresh out of college , can write book reviews . Just as any beginner in the theater can play Polonius . In fact , the technique is much the same . You put on false whiskers and spout platitudes in a high , squeaky voice . But to go in there and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that tortured soul ; or , on the other hand , to analyze the strategy of an intricate football formation or judge a fast ten-round bout on points  --  that 's something else again . To do that , you really have to know your stuff . GEORGINA ALLERTON Oh , yes , you 're very clever and paradoxical , are n't you ? p. 37 CLARK REDFIELD Thank you for the compliment , tinged though it is with a certain asperity . But you see , getting on the sports page is only what might be called a primary objective . For to a really good sportswriter , every door is open : literature , movies , radio , politics , anything . Look at Ring Lardner . Look at Heywood Broun . Look at John Kieran . Look  --  if you can bear it  --  at Westbrook Pegler . In my daydreams , I write a story about the deciding game of the World Series that stampedes the Democratic Convention and lands me in the White House . And on my tentative cabinet slate , you 're down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll see you in Washington . GEORGINA ALLERTON as he is about to go.Oh , just a minute . Did Jim Lucas ever give you  --   --  CLARK REDFIELD Did I hear you aright ? Did you mention the name of Jim Lucas ? GEORGINA ALLERTON Have you got something sarcastic to say about him too ? CLARK REDFIELD Not sarcastic , my dear young woman . Sarcasm would be a wholly inadequate instrument for a commentary on that epic character . But perhaps you have n't heard the news about Jim ? GEORGINA ALLERTON I 've heard that he 's parted company with Wentworth and Jones , if that 's what you mean . p. 38 CLARK REDFIELD Parted company , did you say ? Really , Miss Allerton , you have a gift for hyperbolic understatement . The impact of Jim 's violent expulsion has rocked Publisher 's Row to its foundations . Would you mind telling an inquiring reporter , Miss Allerton , how it feels to be the sister-in-law of the man who sent back the manuscript of Always Opal without even turning in a report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did Jim do that ? CLARK REDFIELD Oh , so you have n't heard . An enterprising book peddler like you should get around more . This Lucas is a celebrity , the greatest bonehead player since Fred Merkle forgot to touch second base . GEORGINA ALLERTON Well , that book deserved to be turned down . It 's nothing but a lot of dressed-up smut , atrociously written , and all in very bad taste , if you ask me . CLARK REDFIELD Wait a minute , Carrie Nation . The verdict of history is already in . Do n't try to alibi Jim , or folks will get the impression that you take more than a sisterly-in-law interest in him . GEORGINA ALLERTON flaring up.That 's an uncalled-for and highly impertinent remark . CLARK REDFIELD Or is it just a case of one hand washing the other ? p. 39 GEORGINA ALLERTON And what is that supposed to mean ? CLARK REDFIELD Well , I got the impression that Jim thinks rather highly of that novel of yours that he asked me to read . GEORGINA ALLERTON eager for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? CLARK REDFIELD Yes , he did . GEORGINA ALLERTON And I suppose , following your usual practice , you have n't read it . CLARK REDFIELD No , you 're wrong . I have read it . All of it  --  well , almost all . GEORGINA ALLERTON after a pause.Well ? CLARK REDFIELD You mean you want my opinion of it ? GEORGINA ALLERTON Well , why do you suppose I let Jim give it to you ? CLARK REDFIELD I was n't sure . Well , to put the thing as delicately as possible , I think it stinks . GEORGINA ALLERTON enraged.Oh , you do , do you ? CLARK REDFIELD Yes , I do . Contemplatively . Yes , that really is a malodorous morsel . In the first place  --  p. 40 GEORGINA ALLERTON almost in tears.Never mind ! I 'm not interested in what you have to say . CLARK REDFIELD Oh , then you really did n't want my opinion . That 's what I thought . GEORGINA ALLERTON I do n't call that an opinion . Just a nasty , insulting  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorable opinion . GEORGINA ALLERTON Nobody wants criticism that 's just destructive . I say if a critic ca n't be constructive  --   --  CLARK REDFIELD You mean you want the critic to do the creative job that you failed to do ? If that 's his function , we might as well dispense with the writer in the first place . Now , if you 'll let me give a piece of friendly advice  --   --  GEORGINA ALLERTON I do n't want your advice . I 'd never have let Jim give you the manuscript if I had known that you 're just a hockey fan . CLARK REDFIELD There 's a good hockey match at the Garden Saturday night . Want to go ? GEORGINA ALLERTON No , I do n't ! And if you 'll excuse me now , I have a lot of work to do . CLARK REDFIELD You have n't a damn thing to do . You just sit around this shop all day to give yourself the illusion that you 're doing something . p. 41 GEORGINA ALLERTON Will you please get out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you ? GEORGINA ALLERTON Not in the least . It just happens that I find you very unpleasant . I think you 're not only lazy and dishonest , but sadistic and vulgar . CLARK REDFIELD Well , I 'm glad you 're not sore . And I think that novel of yours is just about the most terrific thing I 've read since War and Peace . GEORGINA ALLERTON And another thing . I wish you would not ever come here again . CLARK REDFIELD I 'll try to remember that . ' By , now . And thanks for the five bucks . He exits right . GEORGINA ALLERTON with tears of anger.You great big ape ! She stands looking after him for a moment , trembling with rage and humiliation . Then she begins threshing about in uncontrollable fury . She strides to the desk and violently pushes CLARK 's books to the floor . Then she stands with clenched fists glaring in the direction that CLARK has gone and with sudden resolution strides center into the darkness . There is a flash of lightning and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and come up at the right . The pitiful meowing of a cat is heard . CLARK , in his shirtsleeves and wearing a green eyeshade , is seated before a typewriter at an untidy table , piled high with books . Beside him on the floor is a stuffed cat whose tail he is twisting . The meowing is heard again . CLARK laughs fiendishly , pours himself a stiff drink of whisky , gulps it down , and begins pecking at the typewriter . Again lightning and thunder , followed by a sharp knocking . p. 42 CLARK REDFIELD Who the hell is that ? He leans over and twists the cat 's tail again . There is a wail of pain as GEORGINA enters , wearing a hooded cloak . Sneeringly . Oh , it 's you , is it ? GEORGINA ALLERTON Yes , it 's me . I mean it 's I. CLARK REDFIELD I 'm just having a little fun with kitty . GEORGINA ALLERTON grimly.And I 'm going to have a little fun with you ! She takes a revolver from beneath her cloak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terror.No ! No ! Not that ! GEORGINA ALLERTON fires two shots . CLARK shrieks and slumps to the floor . A POLICEMAN rushes on at the right and seizes GEORGINA roughly . POLICEMAN Come along , you ! GEORGINA ALLERTON with quiet dignity.All right . You need n't be rough about it . I did it and I 'm willing to take the consequences . As the POLICEMAN takes her off the lights fade . A tumult of voices and the thumping of a gavel is heard . The lights come up at the center . A JUDGE , who resembles ALLERTON , is seated at the bench , beside which , in the witness chair , GEORGINA sits . The DISTRICT ATTORNEY and JIM LUCAS are seated at the counsel table . JUDGE banging his gavel.Order ! Order ! If there are any more demonstrations , I 'll have the courtroom cleared . As quiet is restored . Proceed with your examination , Mr. District Attorney . p. 43 DISTRICT ATTORNEY pointing an accusing finger.Then you admit that you went there with the deliberate intention of killing Clark Redfield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had every justification . He was a savage brute , a man without  --   --  DISTRICT ATTORNEY I object ! JUDGE banging his gavel.Objection sustained ! JIM LUCAS jumping up.Your Honor , I protest . This young woman is on trial for her life . Is she to be railroaded to the chair without even an opportunity to speak in her own defense ? JUDGE The point is well taken . Proceed , Miss Allerton . GEORGINA ALLERTON Well , let me just ask you this . If he had attacked me , would n't you all agree that I had a right  --   --  JUDGE One moment ! Are we to understand that Clark Redfield attempted to  --   --  GEORGINA ALLERTON No , he did n't . But compared to what he did to me , it would have been easy to submit to  --   --  to  --   --  Well , not easy , but almost preferable . He struck at my dignity , humiliated me , trampled my pride in the dust . And if you men think that an injury to a woman 's body is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then you know nothing about feminine nature . That 's all ! That 's my case ! She glares about defiantly. p. 44 DISTRICT ATTORNEY Your Honor , the people of the State of New York demand the death penalty ! JUDGE Counsel for the defense will now address the jury . Proceed , Mr. Lucas . JIM LUCAS rising and addressing the unseen jury.Ladies and gentlemen of the jury . I speak to you not merely as counsel for Georgina Allerton but as her brother . And by that I do not refer to my accidental marital relationship to her sister , but to the deep , spiritual , fraternal bond that has long existed between the defendant and myself . I can say , in all honesty , that no one understands her as I do ; no other living being has plumbed so profoundly the depths of that tender , sensitive soul . And , in the light of my knowledge and understanding , I say to you that when she struck down Clark Redfield it was no act of murder , but a simple , human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yes , ladies and gentlemen , self-defense ! For what was this novel of hers that Clark Redfield sought to annihilate with the cruel strokes of his sharp-edged tongue and stabbing wit ? It was her baby , ladies and gentlemen , the child of her spirit , as real to her and as dear to her as though it had been , indeed , the flesh-and-blood creation of her body . For it was conceived in the beautiful ecstasy of spiritual passion , nurtured for long months in the dark , secret recesses of her soul , brought forth in an agony of travail . And as it lay nestling in her bosom , so to speak , Clark Redfield struck at it with his lethal weapons ! And with the noble , unerring instinct of outraged maternity , she struck back  --  struck back at the would-be assassin of her baby . Could any mother , could any woman , do less ? I leave the answer to you . He sits down amid cheers and applause. p. 45 JUDGE pounding for order.What is your verdict , ladies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not guilty ! The DISTRICT ATTORNEY leaves in a huff . JUDGE The defendant is dismissed . GEORGINA ALLERTON shaking hands with him.Thank you , Your Honor . JUDGE as he leaves the bench.Not at all . But just a word of fatherly advice , Miss Allerton . In the future , try to avoid the use of firearms . GEORGINA ALLERTON earnestly.I will , Your Honor . Turning to JIM , as the JUDGE exits . Oh , Jim , darling , I knew I could depend on you ! She walks toward JIM , but as the telephone rings in the bookshop she ignores his outstretched arms and hurries to answer it . The lights fade on the courtroom and come up , at the left , on the bookshop . Mermaid Bookshop . No , madam , I 'm sorry ; we 're all out of Always Opal . You 're welcome . CLAIRE BLAKELY who has entered.Why , what 's the matter with you ? You look as though you were ready to commit murder . p. 46 GEORGINA ALLERTON Oh , it 's nothing . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CLAIRE BLAKELY Who did what to you ? GEORGINA ALLERTON It 's too trivial to talk about . It 's just that that Clark Redfield was in and began shooting off his face about a lot of  --   --  Honestly , of all the brash , egotistical fools I ever met ! CLAIRE BLAKELY Well , I 've only met him once or twice , but I had an idea he was kind of nice . How did he like your novel ? GEORGINA ALLERTON Oh , I really do n't know . I did n't even bother to ask him . CLAIRE BLAKELY Sorry . Excuse it , please . She exits . As GEORGINA picks up the scattered books JIM LUCAS enters at the right . JIM LUCAS Hello , Georgina . GEORGINA ALLERTON Oh , hello , Jim . JIM LUCAS Are you busy ? GEORGINA ALLERTON Well , I have a lunch date at one-thirty and  --   --  JIM LUCAS Oh , you 've got lots of time . GEORGINA ALLERTON I was going to stop at Colette 's first , to pick up a new hat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter . Sit down . p. 47 JIM LUCAS complying.I have something to tell you . But maybe you heard it already from Miriam . GEORGINA ALLERTON You mean about your leaving Wentworth and Jones ? JIM LUCAS Oh , that , yes ! Trust Miriam to waste no time in spreading it around . GEORGINA ALLERTON It was n't from Miriam I heard it . Clark Redfield was just in  --   --  JIM LUCAS Good old Clark ! Always the reporter . I suppose he told you why they fired me . GEORGINA ALLERTON Well , he did mention something about Always Opal  --  JIM LUCAS You do n't have to be tactful . I 'm not in the least bit sensitive about it . If I had it to do over again , I 'd still turn that book down . It 's just a piece of trash . GEORGINA ALLERTON Well , that 's exactly what I said to Redfield . JIM LUCAS Good for you ! But what I came in to tell you is that Miriam and I are splitting up . GEORGINA ALLERTON Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just because you 've had some silly quarrel about losing your job  --   --  JIM LUCAS It goes much deeper than that . We never were right for each other . She 's much too down to earth for me , and I 'm much too undependable for her . p. 48 GEORGINA ALLERTON It just does n't seem right to me . And when you get to thinking it over  --   --  JIM LUCAS There 's nothing more to think over . It 's all settled , and Miriam is just as relieved about it as I am . I have n't felt so free and so hopeful in years . Well , you 'd better run along to your lunch date . I just wanted to give you my version of the situation , before you heard about it from the other side of the family . GEORGINA ALLERTON Well , I 'm glad you did . JIM LUCAS going to her.So am I ! It 's wonderful to be able to talk to somebody who has some idea of what you 're getting at . One of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and me to get back on our old footing again . I 've felt a kind of restraint in you these past two years and I  --   --  GEORGINA ALLERTON greatly troubled.Well , I  --   --  JIM LUCAS Yes , it was natural enough , I suppose . But it does n't have to be that way any more . Now we can be friends as we used to be . Taking her hand . Good-by , Georgina . I 'll see you soon . GEORGINA ALLERTON Yes , Jim . JIM exits quickly . GEORGINA , on the verge of tears , stands looking after him . CLAIRE BLAKELY entering.Did n't you say something about a lunch date ? p. 49 GEORGINA ALLERTON startled.What ? Oh , yes ! Looking at her watch . Heavens , I 'm going to keep him waiting again ! CLAIRE BLAKELY Somebody interesting ? GEORGINA ALLERTON with attempted nonchalance.Just George Hand . CLAIRE BLAKELY George Hand is taking you to lunch again ? GEORGINA ALLERTON Well , what 's wrong about that ? He 's a book jobber and we run a bookshop  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ? Am I in on this lunch date ? GEORGINA ALLERTON What a mind you have ! Just because Mr. Hand and I happened to discover that we have a few things in common  --   --  CLAIRE BLAKELY Which he hopes will eventually include a bed . GEORGINA ALLERTON Claire , will you please stop ! You 'll make me so self-conscious that I wo n't know what to say to him . CLAIRE BLAKELY Well , if you ca n't think of anything else , you can always say no . GEORGINA ALLERTON Maybe I should phone the Canard Rouge and tell him I 'm not coming . I 'm terribly upset and in no mood for one of those fencing matches . p. 50 CLAIRE BLAKELY Goodness , does a little tiff with Clark Redfield make you  --   --  GEORGINA ALLERTON Certainly not ! I 've even forgotten Clark Redfield 's existence . Jim Lucas was just in to tell me that he and Miriam are divorcing . Is n't that dreadful ? CLAIRE BLAKELY People do it every day , with the greatest of ease . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Jim . GEORGINA ALLERTON That seems to be a general opinion with which I disagree . Oh , well , I may as well have lunch with George Hand and get it over with . I 'll be back as soon as I can . CLAIRE BLAKELY as GEORGINA exits at the right. Do n't hurry ! And do n't say no , until after the liqueurs . The telephone rings . Mermaid Bookshop  --   --  No , madam , I 'm sorry , we 're all out of Always Opal  --   --  Well , we 're expecting  --   --  Her voice and the scene fade out . The lights come up at right on a semicircular upholstered booth in a corner of the Canard Rouge , a chichi midtown restaurant . GEORGINA and GEORGE HAND are seated over their coffee and brandy . HAND is a brisk , good-looking man , getting on to forty . GEORGINA is wearing a gay , plumed hat . GEORGE HAND Think you could manage another brandy ? p. 51 GEORGINA ALLERTON I definitely could not manage one other thing . Except maybe a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her. Oh , sure ! What made you go on the wagon ? GEORGINA ALLERTON Two cocktails and two brandies for lunch ! Is that your idea of being on the wagon ? GEORGE HAND I used to know a girl who took three Cuba libres with breakfast . GEORGINA ALLERTON What interesting people you know ! Did she work ? GEORGE HAND Well , not in the daytime , I guess . She was a night telephone operator . Is that bookshop keeping you busy ? GEORGINA ALLERTON Afraid not . In fact , we 've about decided to close it . GEORGE HAND That 's a good idea . What astrologer advised you to pick that grim location ? GEORGINA ALLERTON I guess we did n't use very good judgment , did we ? GEORGE HAND I do n't think you 're cut out for a business career . GEORGINA ALLERTON That 's what my partner says . But what career am I cut out for ? GEORGE HAND Have you tried love ? p. 52 GEORGINA ALLERTON You wo n't take me seriously , will you ? GEORGE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other way . GEORGINA ALLERTON No , I mean it ! GEORGE HAND Well , what would be the point of both of us taking you seriously ? No sense in overdoing the thing . GEORGINA ALLERTON You think I take myself too seriously ? GEORGE HAND Well , let 's say seriously enough . GEORGINA ALLERTON I suppose I do . And that 's bad , is n't it ? GEORGE HAND Terrible . GEORGINA ALLERTON Why ? GEORGE HAND Think of all the fun you miss . GEORGINA ALLERTON Yes , maybe I do . I 've often wished that I could be just  --  well , just completely reckless and irresponsible , like  --  like  --  oh , I do n't know who . GEORGE HAND Like Opal ? GEORGINA ALLERTON Well , yes , now that you mention it ! Is that why everybody is so mad to read that silly book ? GEORGE HAND What are you being so snooty about ? Why , that book is positively a boon to womankind ! For two-fifty flat or three cents a day any Hausfrau in the land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literature . p. 53 GEORGINA ALLERTON Is that really what every woman wants ? GEORGE HAND All I can go by is the sales figures . GEORGINA ALLERTON So you think we 're all harlots at heart ? GEORGE HAND Well , I would n't want to run for Congress on that platform . GEORGINA ALLERTON Still , even if you 're right , there seems to be an awful lot of women who manage not to  --   --  GEORGE HAND I know . That 's what makes life so difficult for a man . GEORGINA ALLERTON Oh , poor Mr. Hand ! Do we make things difficult for you ? GEORGE HAND Very . But I do n't complain . No victory without labor , my Sunday-school teacher used to say . And , by the way , my name is George . GEORGINA ALLERTON Yes , George . GEORGE HAND That 's better . George and Georgina . We sound like a team of adagio dancers . I consider that very auspicious . GEORGINA ALLERTON I was named after my father . He 's George too . GEORGE HAND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me because I remind you of your father . GEORGINA ALLERTON You do n't remind me in the least of my father . And who told you that I 'm attracted to you ? p. 54 GEORGE HAND You know , I am really beginning to go for you in a big way . Shaking his head . I ca n't figure this out . GEORGINA ALLERTON You mean there 's really something you ca n't figure out ? GEORGE HAND Uh-huh . Just one thing . You ! GEORGINA ALLERTON Oh , so I 'm an enigma ! What fun ! GEORGE HAND No fooling , how does a girl who has all that you have happen to be so unattached ? GEORGINA ALLERTON Maybe my virtues  --  no , that is n't the word ! Maybe my charms are n't as apparent to everyone as they are to you . GEORGE HAND I do n't believe that ! Or are you one of those girls who think they 're only interested in marriage ? GEORGINA ALLERTON I 'm not in the least interested in marriage . GEORGE HAND You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've seen of it , I think the odds are all against you . GEORGE HAND You 're so right ! Well , that makes everything much simpler . GEORGINA ALLERTON For whom ? GEORGE HAND For you , of course . It does n't cramp your style , does n't limit the range of your experiences . p. 55 GEORGINA ALLERTON Why , that 's true , is n't it ? You have a wonderful gift for clarifying things . GEORGE HAND Do n't be coy , Georgina . You 'll never get me to believe that a sophisticated girl like you has never had any experiences . GEORGINA ALLERTON Well , it would be hard to believe that a sophisticated girl could get to be twenty-two without having had some experiences . GEORGE HAND Then what the hell ? Or does your aversion to marriage extend to men who are already married ? GEORGINA ALLERTON I often wonder how I 'd feel if I were the man 's wife . Or is that very unsophisticated ? GEORGE HAND Not a bit . Does credit to your upbringing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get along fine together except when she has a drink too many and then we really go to town . Otherwise , I do n't interfere with her and she does n't interfere with me . GEORGINA ALLERTON That 's what I mean about marriage . GEORGE HAND I agreed with you , did n't I ? But you 'll admit I 'm not one of the lads who comes crying for sympathy because he 's so misunderstood . GEORGINA ALLERTON No , that 's true . I knew there was something about you that was different . p. 56 GEORGE HAND No flattery , please ! Tell me , have you ever been to Mexico ? GEORGINA ALLERTON Thanks for changing the subject . No , I have n't been to Mexico . But I 've always wanted to go . GEORGE HAND Wonderful ! But I have n't changed the subject . I have to go down next month and I 've been thinking what fun it would be if you and I could sort of meet up there . GEORGINA ALLERTON Oh , have you ? GEORGE HAND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before and I know my way around . We 'd take in jai-alai matches and bullfights  --   --  GEORGINA ALLERTON I should say not ! GEORGE HAND All right , we 'll stay away from bullfights . Anyhow , we 'd find some village fiestas , look at the Rivera frescoes , and drift along on the flower boats at Xochimilco . And talk about food ! Have you ever eaten mole ? GEORGINA ALLERTON No , I do n't think I have . GEORGE HAND It 's turkey with a sauce made of chocolate and about fifteen different kinds of pepper . Sounds revolting , does n't it ? GEORGINA ALLERTON It certainly does ! GEORGE HAND I 'm telling you it 's tops . Especially when washed down with a bottle of tequila . You 've heard of Taxco , have n't you ? p. 57 GEORGINA ALLERTON Yes , of course . GEORGE HAND Well , a friend of mine has a house there that he hardly ever uses . Up on a terraced hill , looking down onto the little village plaza . We 'd have dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and serenade us . Why , I can just see you , done up in a rebozo and  --   --  GEORGINA ALLERTON You are a salesman , are n't you ? Before HAND can reply , a MAN enters at the left and goes to the right . MAN as he passes the table.Hi , George ! How are you doing ? He waves and goes out at the right . GEORGE HAND Why , hello , Bert ! Excitedly to GEORGINA . This is really from the gods ! You know who that is ? Bert Glover , the fellow who owns the house in Taxco . Jumping up . Excuse me ! I 'll be right back ! GEORGINA ALLERTON No , wait , please ! GEORGE HAND I wo n't be a minute ! He exits quickly at right . GEORGINA looks after him for a moment , considerably agitated , then sits back dreamily , lost in her imaginings . As the lights fade slowly on the scene the sound of singing is heard , center . The lights come up on a corner of an exotic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are strumming guitars and singing a sentimental Spanish love song . The leader of the trio , a tall , good-looking young man , has the face of CLARK REDFIELD . After a moment GEORGINA and HAND stroll on at the right , GEORGINA wearing a mantilla and a bright shawl and carrying a fan . He has his arm about her . They stand listening to the music . The song ends , and the serenaders cover their hearts with their sombreros and bow low . GEORGINA ALLERTON clapping her hands.Oh , lovely , lovely ! Buena ! Buena ! Muchas gracias ! p. 58 GEORGE HAND That was great ! Reaching into his pocket . Here 's something for you , boys . The LEADER comes forward , holding out his sombrero . HAND drops a fistful of coins into it . LEADER Gracias , seor ! Muchas gracias ! Buenas noches , seor ! Buenas noches , seorita ! He bend over GEORGINA 'S hand , and kisses it . GEORGINA ALLERTON Buenas noches ! Hasta la vista , caballero ! LEADER Hasta la vista , seorita ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exit . GEORGINA ALLERTON Viva M-hi-co ! Oh , this is really heavenly . That wonderful moon , this clear cool air , filled with the scent of flowers , and that charming song  --   --  GEORGE HAND What about that charming singer ? Good thing I 'm broad-minded . That young man seemed to take quite a fancy to you . GEORGINA ALLERTON It 's strange . There 's something so familiar about him . And yet I ca n't think of whom he reminds me . She fans herself throughout . GEORGE HAND Well , do n't bother . You 're supposed to be concentrating on me , you know . By the way , where did you pick up all that Spanish ? Why , you talk it like a native ! p. 59 GEORGINA ALLERTON modestly.Oh , do n't be silly . But I was always good at languages , and seor Gonzales at Berlitz did tell me I have a good accent . GEORGE HAND Next time you see him , you can tell him I said you 're an all-around good girl . GEORGINA ALLERTON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that exquisite food ! Who would have believed that turkey with chocolate sauce could taste like that ! GEORGE HAND I was right about it , was n't I ? GEORGINA ALLERTON Indeed you were ! You were right about lots of things . Only  --  well , I ca n't help thinking that tomorrow all this will end . GEORGE HAND Georgina , there 's something I want to say to you . I knew darned well that when you finally agreed to this it was only because you thought maybe I could help you forget somebody it made you unhappy to think about . It 's true , is n't it ? GEORGINA ALLERTON Yes , it 's true . I was trying to escape , desperately running away from a situation I did n't know how to cope with . GEORGE HAND Then tell me something else . Have I helped you forget ? GEORGINA ALLERTON Yes , George , you have . That 's why it 's so hard  --  No , I wo n't say it ! p. 60 GEORGE HAND You 've said all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Georgina , I thought I had nothing more to learn about women , but I was wrong . I do n't want this to be the end , but just the beginning . GEORGINA ALLERTON Why do you say such things , when you know it 's impossible ? GEORGE HAND No , it 's not impossible . In fact it 's all arranged . While you were at the market this afternoon , I called up my wife . I told her I want a divorce and  --   --  GEORGINA ALLERTON No , I wo n't hear of it ! I 'm not one of those girls that breaks up marriages . That 's one reason I 've said no to every married man who  --   --  GEORGE HAND Wait a minute ! You 're not breaking up any marriage . My wife jumped at the suggestion . It seems she 's interested in some band leader and she had just about made up her mind to ask me for a divorce . GEORGINA ALLERTON Are you telling me the truth ? GEORGE HAND I could n't lie to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know you 're too smart for me to get away with it . Georgina , this is really from the gods ! You ca n't say no ! GEORGINA ALLERTON I  --  I do n't know , George . You 've got to give me time to think  --   --  As they move right and the lights fade on the scene . I must have time to think ! The lights come up slowly at the right . GEORGINA is seated at the table as before , lost in her dreams and fanning herself with the luncheon check . She does not see HAND as he hurries on at the right. p. 61 GEORGE HAND coming up to the table. Well , we 're in great luck . Everything is  --   --  GEORGINA ALLERTON almost jumping out of her seat.Oh ! Goodness , you nearly frightened me out of my wits ! GEORGE HAND Sorry ! You look as though you 'd been a million miles away . Sitting beside her . Listen , Georgina , I 've fixed it all up with Bert . GEORGINA ALLERTON Bert ? GEORGE HAND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was down there and wo n't be going again for months . It 's just sitting there waiting for us . Well , what do you say ? GEORGINA ALLERTON Well , goodness , I ca n't give you an answer just like that ! GEORGE HAND Yes , you can ! Never fight your impulses . Take it from me , the things we really regret in life are not those we do , but those we do n't do . GEORGINA ALLERTON I 've got to have time to make up my mind . GEORGE HAND All right . How much time do you want  --  two days , a week ? GEORGINA ALLERTON Do you have to pin me down like that ? GEORGE HAND Sure I do ! Because when a gay time is lost , it 's lost forever . p. 62 GEORGINA ALLERTON Well , I 'll  --  I 'll think it over . Looking at her watch . Goodness , it 's nearly three o'clock . I 've got to get back to the shop . She rises . GEORGE HAND signing the check.And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drop you ? GEORGINA ALLERTON No , you run along . I want to powder my nose . Extending her hand . Thanks for a marvelous lunch . GEORGE HAND holding her hand.Remember what the voice of experience is saying to you ; Do n't resist your impulses . Good-by ! I wo n't leave you in peace for long ! GEORGINA ALLERTON as he goes off.Well  --   --  ! She stands looking after him , greatly flustered . A WAITER enters , picks up the check , and starts to clear the table . Oh , do you think I could have another brandy ? WAITER Certainly , madam . The imported ? GEORGINA ALLERTON What ? Oh , yes , the imported , by all means . WAITER Yes , madam . He goes . GEORGINA sits at the table. p. 63 GEORGINA ALLERTON gloomily.So now you 're taking to drink , are you ? Just like all the other misfits who ca n't face their problems and try to make alcohol a substitute for character . Oh , Georgina , Georgina , my girl , you 're really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the lights fade and the curtain falls. @x As the curtain rises the lights come up on the bookshop , at the left , as in Act One . CLAIRE is straightening books on the shelves . A moment later GEORGINA enters , considerably exhilarated . GEORGINA ALLERTON I 'm back . CLAIRE BLAKELY I was just about to call the Juvenile Delinquents ' Court . Seeing GEORGINA 's new hat . Well , for heaven 's sake ! She examines it at close range . Colette has really outdone herself . GEORGINA ALLERTON Like it ? CLAIRE BLAKELY I 'm green with envy . How did Mr. Hand react to it ? GEORGINA ALLERTON He was very polite about it . CLAIRE BLAKELY Now , do n't hold out on me . Come on , tell Auntie Claire everything that happened . GEORGINA ALLERTON Well , we ate and ate , and drank and drank , and talked and talked . CLAIRE BLAKELY What did you talk about ? GEORGINA ALLERTON Oh , all sorts of things . You were right about his intentions . He wants me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ? Well , he 's obviously not a man who lets the grass grow under his feet . p. 65 GEORGINA ALLERTON No , he is n't . He 's been to Mexico and knows all the places to go . Besides that , a friend of his has a house in Taxco and we could have the use of it . CLAIRE BLAKELY But how romantic ! GEORGINA ALLERTON It is sort of . And I 've always wanted to go to Mexico . CLAIRE BLAKELY Yes , they say that travel broadens the mind . And he certainly sounds like a broad-minded boy . GEORGINA ALLERTON Well , I must say he was nice and frank about the whole thing . He did n't try to give me any line or pretend a lot of things . He just frankly put it up to me . CLAIRE BLAKELY Uh-huh ! The direct frontal attack or appeal to the intelligence . After all , we 're living in the twentieth century . Let 's be modern about this thing . Very flattering . GEORGINA ALLERTON removing her hat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual line of flattery . If I 'm going into something like this , I 'd rather go in with my eyes open . CLAIRE BLAKELY And are you going into it ? GEORGINA ALLERTON I promised him I 'd think it over . CLAIRE BLAKELY Why , Georgina Allerton ! p. 66 GEORGINA ALLERTON Does that shock you ? CLAIRE BLAKELY Well , it just does n't sound like you . Tell me , are you in love with him ? GEORGINA ALLERTON Well , he 's a clever , successful , good-looking man . And I am attracted to him . He 's not making any demand of me , or pretending he 's in love with me . If it 's all right for him , why is n't it for me ? CLAIRE BLAKELY You 're desperately logical about it . GEORGINA ALLERTON Why do men have to have a monopoly on logic ? CLAIRE BLAKELY I do n't know . But somehow , when a woman falls back on logic  --   --  GEORGINA ALLERTON That 's just a hangover from the days when women led sheltered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fluttery , scatterbrained little ninnies , who have to rely on something called intuition . Why ca n't we work out our own problems , just as men do , by using our intelligence ? CLAIRE BLAKELY It really looks as though Mr. Hand has been using the right technique ! GEORGINA ALLERTON He 's not fooling me with any technique . I 'm thinking very clearly about the whole thing , and entirely from my own point of view . After all , what would be the harm in it ? It 's not so unusual these days for a girl to  --   --  p. 67 CLAIRE BLAKELY Oh , I do n't think it 's likely that you 'd be put in the stocks and branded with a large , scarlet capital A. GEORGINA ALLERTON You mean I might be hurt emotionally ? All right , suppose I did get hurt a little ! It might be the best thing in the world for me  --  just what I need maybe . If I do n't begin to have some experiences soon , when will I begin ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed less eager to go off on a toot with George Hand . GEORGINA ALLERTON He thinks I 'm puritanical , and I 'm afraid he may be right . CLAIRE BLAKELY Afraid ? GEORGINA ALLERTON Well , after all , what is a puritan ? Just somebody with such strong desires that she does n't dare let herself cut loose . CLAIRE BLAKELY Oh , so that 's what you 're afraid of ! You think if you say yes to him it will just be your first step on the road to hell ? GEORGINA ALLERTON That would be pretty awful , would n't it ? CLAIRE BLAKELY It would indeed ! Well , darling , I think I 'll pop out and do some shopping . Think you can look after the trade by yourself ? GEORGINA ALLERTON Oh , damn it ! I wish you 'd be a little helpful . p. 68 CLAIRE BLAKELY No , my pet ! This is between you and your guardian angel  --  and I ca n't wait to see who wins ! GEORGINA ALLERTON as CLAIRE exits.Neither can I ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the scene . To the music of " Poor Butterfly , " the lights come up at the center on a red fire-alarm lamppost . In the background is an illuminated sign bearing the legend " Joyland . " GEORGINA enters and swaggers to the lamppost . She wears a cheap red coat with a ratty fur collar and a gaudy hat perched on a tousled blond wig . GEORGE HAND , accompanied by a girl who resembles MIRIAM , emerges from the darkness , at the right . GEORGE HAND as they cross.Well , Arabella , if you 've never eaten at Antoine 's in New Orleans , you really do n't know what food is . ARABELLA Yes , so I 've heard . GEORGE HAND glancing at GEORGINA as he passes her.We 'd start with oysters Rockefeller , which Ford Madox Ford , who was a great epicure , describes as swimming in a kind of green scum . Stopping at left . Excuse me a moment ! He turns and goes back to GEORGINA , who starts to go as she sees him approaching . Detaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GEORGINA ALLERTON in a rough voice.Hands off , you ! GEORGE HAND turning her around.Why , I ' was right ! It 's Georgina Allerton . GEORGINA ALLERTON Well , what 's it to you ? GEORGE HAND What are you doing here , hanging around a street corner ? GEORGINA ALLERTON Looking after my trade , that 's what ! GEORGE HAND But  --  a girl like you ! What 's brought you to this ? GEORGINA ALLERTON It would give you a kick , would n't it , to hear all about it ? You 're all like that ! GEORGE HAND But in Mexico you were such a gay , proud girl , full of the joy of living ; and dreaming of all the things you were going to do . GEORGINA ALLERTON harshly.I did n't know how easy it would be to say yes , the next time someone asked me . And the next time after that , it was easier still . Then they stopped asking me  --  and I began asking them . Now you know all about it . So , go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's anything I can  --   --  GEORGINA ALLERTON To hell with that ! I do n't want your pity . p. 70 GEORGE HAND Well , let me , at least  --   --  He takes a bill from his pocket and offers it to her . GEORGINA snatches it and tears it up . GEORGINA ALLERTON Go on , now ! Beat it ! Your girl friend is waiting for you ! HAND sighs , shakes his head , and goes left . ARABELLA as he rejoins her.For heaven 's sake , what was that all about ? GEORGE HAND as they exit.It 's tragic . I used to know that girl , years ago . And believe it or not , she was a sweet , modest little  --   --  His voice trails off . The tune changes to " Broadway Rose . " GEORGINA ALLERTON buries her face in her hands and sobs , then as she hears a man whistling off right , she straightens up and resumes her place at the lamppost . CLARK REDFIELD strides on , whistling merrily . He glances quickly at GEORGINA as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tonight , dearie ? CLARK REDFIELD Sorry , baby , but I 've got a little wife waiting for me . He is about to exit , then stops and turns . Say , have n't I seen you somewhere before ? p. 71 GEORGINA ALLERTON brazenly.Have you ? CLARK REDFIELD Why , sure enough ! You 're that girl who used to run that crummy little bookshop on East  --  ! Well , I 'll be dammed ! GEORGINA ALLERTON savagely.What the hell 's so funny about it ? CLARK REDFIELD Why , who 'd have thought it ? Little Miss  --  whatever your name is ! The budding literary genius , the highly cultivated young college grad , who lectured me about my manners and thought sportswriting was vulgar . Well , it looks like you 're doing a little in the sporting line yourself . GEORGINA ALLERTON Shut up , you great big ape ! She slaps his face . CLARK REDFIELD in a rage.Oh , that 's how you feel about it , is it ? Well , I 'll show you ! There 's a place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Officer ! He disappears in the darkness . GEORGINA looks about in terror , then opens her handbag , takes out a small bottle , and drains it . The tune changes to " Hearts and Flowers " JIM LUCAS off right. Georgina ! Stop ! For God 's sake , stop ! He rushes on. p. 72 GEORGINA ALLERTON with a wan smile , as she throws the bottle away.You 're too late , Jim . Nothing can save me , now . JIM LUCAS Why have you done this , Georgina ? Why did n't you come to me ? I would have  --  GEORGINA ALLERTON No , Jim , I could n't do that . You have Miriam and those three lovely children . Once I brought you two together again , there was no place for me in your life . There 's no place for me anywhere . She totters . Hold me , Jim , hold me ! I 'm  --   --  She collapses into his arms . JIM LUCAS Georgina , I  --   --  GEORGINA ALLERTON faintly.Do n't say anything , Jim . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it was n't meant to be . So let me die in them . It 's the only happiness I 'll ever know now . Good-by , Jim . Kiss Mother and Dad for me . And ask them to forgive me . And try not to forget me , Jim . There was never anybody for me but you  --   --  JIM LUCAS I 'll never forget you  --  never ! GEORGINA ALLERTON Thank you , Jim . Good-by , darling . Standing erect for a moment . It is a far , far better thing that I do than I have ever done . It is a far , far better rest I go to than I have ever known . She clasps her abdomen in agony , pivots on her heels , and falls inert. p. 73 JIM LUCAS kneeling beside her.Georgina ! Georgina , my darling ! CLARK reappears at left , accompanied by a POLICEMAN . Policeman . Is that her ? CLARK REDFIELD Yes , she accosted me ! She 's nothing but a common  --   --  My God , what 's happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one can harm her now . CLARK REDFIELD removing his hat.You mean she 's  --   --  ? JIM LUCAS Yes , Clark Redfield , she is . CLARK REDFIELD with an agonized cry.Oh , no ! Oh , why did I do it ? If only I 'd been a little human to her ! Turning to the POLICEMAN . Officer , arrest me ! Take me away ! POLICEMAN What for ? CLARK REDFIELD I 'm a murderer . I killed that girl as surely as though I had stabbed her to the heart . POLICEMAN Then come along ! He snaps handcuffs on CLARK as the light fades on the scene and the clanging of a patrol-wagon bell is heard . The sound merges into that of a ringing telephone . The lights come up left on the bookshop . GEORGINA , seated moodily , is startled by the ringing of the telephone . She hurries to it and answers it . GEORGINA ALLERTON greatly flustered.Hello ! Mermaid Bookshop ! p. 74 As she speaks , the lights come up , stage right , on a telephone booth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Allerton there ? GEORGINA ALLERTON This is she . CLARK REDFIELD Oh , I did n't recognize your voice . You sound scared to death . GEORGINA ALLERTON sharply.Who is this , please ? CLARK REDFIELD Clark Redfield . GEORGINA ALLERTON who knew it all along.Oh , it 's you , is it ? Well , what is it ? CLARK REDFIELD I want to ask you to  --   --  GEORGINA ALLERTON I do n't care to hear any apologies . The whole thing is of no consequence whatever . I was foolish to let my temper get the better of me . And , as far as I 'm concerned , the whole incident is closed . CLARK REDFIELD Yes , you have got a temper , have n't you ? But are you under the impression that I called up to apologize for something ? GEORGINA ALLERTON Well , I guess that 's foolish too  --  to expect you to have that much graciousness . Look , I 'm quite busy and if you do n't mind  --   --  p. 75 CLARK REDFIELD I 'll bet you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll excuse me , Mr. Redfield  --   --  CLARK REDFIELD Whoa ! Wait a minute ! Do n't hang up on me ! I 'm calling to ask you  --   --  GEORGINA ALLERTON Well , what ? Please get to the point , will you ? CLARK REDFIELD I 've got a pair of tickets for a show tonight and I thought you might like to  --   --  GEORGINA ALLERTON Well , of all the unmitigated  --   --  ! You really have got the hide of an elephant . What makes you think I 'd consider  --   --  CLARK REDFIELD Well , it 's the opening of The Merchant of Venice , with James Zerney as Shylock . And I thought that might appeal to a lover of the classics . GEORGINA ALLERTON Well , under ordinary circumstances , it certainly would . Especially with Hilda Vincent playing Portia ; but I 'm afraid  --   --  CLARK REDFIELD Is she a favorite of yours ? GEORGINA ALLERTON It just happens that we went to college together and  --   --  CLARK REDFIELD Good ! Then it 's a date ! p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But thank you all the same , though I ca n't imagine why you  --   --  CLARK REDFIELD I ca n't either . It was just an impulse and I  --   --  GEORGINA ALLERTON You do n't strike me as the impulsive type . I should rather think of you as decidedly calculating . CLARK REDFIELD All right . What do you say we settle for a calculated impulse ? As the operator cuts in . All right , just a minute ! GEORGINA ALLERTON What 's that ? CLARK REDFIELD fishing in his pockets.The operator wants another nickel . GEORGINA ALLERTON Well , there 's no necessity for prolonging  --   --  CLARK REDFIELD No , wait a minute , Georgina ! No , I 'm not talking to you , operator . Listen , I have n't got a nickel , operator . Flourishing a bill . Can you change five dollars for me ? Well , where 's all that service you people do so much advertising about ? Just a second ! Look , Georgina , call me back , will you ? GEORGINA ALLERTON I have nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call me back ! The number is Circle 5-7933 . Hello ! Hello ! Oh , damn it ! He bangs down the receiver , leans back in the booth , and lights a cigarette . GEORGINA ALLERTON I tell you I  --  hello ! She hangs up and slowly jots down the number on a pad . Then she sits staring at the telephone . She raises her forefinger as though to dial , then lowers it again . The phone rings and she jumps . Picking up the phone . I thought you did n't have another  --   --  The lights come up quickly at the center on GEORGE HAND , seated at his desk , and talking into the telephone . Throughout , CLARK keeps looking at his telephone , waiting for it to ring . GEORGE HAND Hello ? Is that you , Georgina ? GEORGINA ALLERTON Yes . Who is this ? Knowing full well . GEORGE HAND This is George . Anything wrong ? You sound jumpy . GEORGINA ALLERTON It must be all those brandies . I 'm not used to  --   --  GEORGE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in training . Look , honey , a business dinner date just blew up on me , so I thought maybe you 'd take pity on a poor guy with an evening on his hands and  --   --  p. 78 GEORGINA ALLERTON nervously.Oh , I really do n't think I can tonight , George  --   --  CLARK is beginning to get impatient . GEORGE HAND We can take our time over a nice dinner somewhere and then go dancing  --  or to a show , if you 'd rather . GEORGINA ALLERTON I only wish I could . If you 'd only called up a half-hour sooner ! I just promised somebody I 'd go to the theater . GEORGE HAND Tough luck ! But I called the minute I knew I 'd be free . Why do n't you get out of it ? GEORGINA ALLERTON I do n't see how , after just saying yes ten minutes ago . GEORGE HAND Well , then , how about cocktails and dinner ? Or a drink after the show ? GEORGINA ALLERTON I 'm afraid that 's all included . GEORGE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sic the Attorney General on him ! GEORGINA ALLERTON It 's nothing like that . Just one of those things that you get into and ca n't get out of . GEORGE HAND Well , try to get out of at least some part of it . I do want to see you . GEORGINA ALLERTON All right , I 'll try my best . p. 79 GEORGE HAND Shall I call you back ? GEORGINA ALLERTON No , I 'm just leaving . If I can fix it , I 'll call you . CLARK leaves the booth and starts to exit , then changes his mind and comes back . GEORGE HAND Well , I 'll keep my fingers crossed . Because I 've got you very much on my mind . And if I do lose tonight , I 'll owe you lunch tomorrow  --  yes ? GEORGINA ALLERTON All right ! Good-by , George . And thanks . GEORGE HAND Good-by , dear . He hangs up and the lights fade out quickly on him . GEORGINA hangs up and leans back with a deep sigh . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment , then starts slowly to dial . CLARK REDFIELD with sudden anger.Oh , to hell with it ! He leaves the booth and strides off right . The phone in the booth rings , then again and once again . GEORGINA , very much annoyed , is about to hang up , but CLARK comes tearing back and picks up the phone in the booth just in time . Hello ! Is that you ? GEORGINA ALLERTON Well , you certainly took your time about answering . CLARK REDFIELD I fell asleep waiting for you to call . What 's the matter , have you got telephone operator 's cramp or something ? p. 80 GEORGINA ALLERTON I happened to have another call . You seem to forget I 'm running a business . CLARK REDFIELD Running conveys an idea of activity . GEORGINA ALLERTON The only reason I called back is that I do n't want you to have the false impression that I 'm sufficiently interested in anything you may have said , this morning or at any other time , to make me feel the slightest bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were never going to get to the end of that one ! Now , to get back to The Merchant of Venice  --   --  GEORGINA ALLERTON Yes , exactly . In the first place , I have no interest whatever in being taken to the theater by you . But I would like to see Hilda Vincent play Portia , so  --   --  CLARK REDFIELD Right ! So you 'll go . GEORGINA ALLERTON Will you please let me finish ? CLARK REDFIELD If you think you can by eight-forty . GEORGINA ALLERTON What I started to say is that I 'll consider it only on a strictly business basis . CLARK REDFIELD I have a feeling that neither of us knows what you 're talking about . p. 81 GEORGINA ALLERTON What I mean is that if you have an extra ticket on your hands , I 'll be glad to buy it from you . CLARK REDFIELD Ca n't be done . These are press seats . GEORGINA ALLERTON interestedly.Oh , are you going to review the play ? CLARK REDFIELD I am not . I got them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tonight and he has to give her away . GEORGINA ALLERTON Do the movie critics get tickets for plays too ? CLARK REDFIELD Look , Georgina , this is one of those phones where you have to stand up . How about meeting me at  --   --  GEORGINA ALLERTON Are you dressing ? CLARK REDFIELD Certainly not ! Nobody dresses for Shakespeare , unless Bea Lillie happens to be in it . GEORGINA ALLERTON Then I 'll meet you in the lobby at eight-thirty . Unless you want to leave the ticket with the ticket-taker . CLARK REDFIELD No , I do n't ! How about dinner ? GEORGINA ALLERTON I 'll have dinner somewhere . CLARK REDFIELD You 're a resourceful girl . I think I 'll do likewise . Maybe we could have it at the same place  --  purely by coincidence , of course . p. 82 GEORGINA ALLERTON Thank you , but I do n't care to  --   --  CLARK REDFIELD Look , one of the things I do n't like to do is eat alone . It makes me feel so unwanted . You do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the talking . And you can read a book or sulk in your beer or whatever you like . GEORGINA ALLERTON Well  --  only if it 's clearly understood that we go Dutch . CLARK REDFIELD I was thinking of going Italian . Do you know Emilio 's ? GEORGINA ALLERTON No , I do n't . CLARK REDFIELD Well , it 's just a spaghetti and red ink joint , but what would be called , in France , a serious house . They have  --   --  GEORGINA ALLERTON There 's no reason why you should take me to dinner and I  --   --  CLARK REDFIELD There are two reasons  --  both valid from my point of view . The first is that that five bucks I got from you is burning a hole in my pocket . And the second is that I have something to celebrate . GEORGINA ALLERTON Well , I 'm afraid I have n't . CLARK REDFIELD All right then , you can watch me celebrate . Listen , I 'm getting acute claustrophobia . Emilio 's at seven . p. 83 GEORGINA ALLERTON I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ REDFIELD Good ! That will give you something to brood over at dinner while I talk . I 'm hanging up now . GEORGINA ALLERTON Just a minute ! Where is this Emilio 's ? CLARK REDFIELD Oh , yes , you may as well know that . Forty-seventh , just west of Eighth . Good-by ! GEORGINA ALLERTON Oh , just one other thing  --   --  Then , hastily , as JIM enters . All right , Emilio 's at seven . She hangs up . The light fades quickly on CLARK . Flustered . Oh , hello , Jim ! JIM LUCAS Yes , here I am , back again . But only to ask you if you can have dinner with me . GEORGINA ALLERTON Oh , I 'm sorry , Jim ! I just this minute made a date . Maybe I can break it  --  only I 'm not sure that I know where to  --   --  JIM LUCAS That 's too bad . I was hoping we could  --  GEORGINA ALLERTON How about lunch tomorrow ? I have a sort of tentative date , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LUCAS I wo n't be here tomorrow . I 'm leaving for Reno tonight . p. 84 GEORGINA ALLERTON You 're going to Reno ? But I thought you said Miriam  --   --  JIM LUCAS Yes , I 've had another session with Miriam . She made a great to-do about being separated from her obstetrician , so I said I 'd go . Georgina , I 've got something very important to say to you , and since I have only these few minutes , you 'll forgive me if I seem blunt about it . GEORGINA ALLERTON Well , what is it ? JIM LUCAS Well , I came here this morning , without knowing why ; it was sheer impulse . But now I do know why . It was because it 's you I 've always wanted , because unconsciously I 've always been reaching out for you . GEORGINA ALLERTON greatly agitated.You 're just imagining all that . It 's the way people always behave when they 're going through an emotional crisis . JIM LUCAS Yes , I knew you 'd say that . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But it is n't so , and I know now that you 're the answer to everything I want and need . Does that make you unhappy ? GEORGINA ALLERTON Oh , no , Jim . Not unhappy . It 's just that this is the last thing in the world I was expecting . JIM LUCAS Well , if it disturbs you so , it must mean that you have some deep feeling for me too . Does it , Georgina ? Please be honest with me. p. 85 GEORGINA ALLERTON All right ! I will be honest ! Yes , I do care for you . I always have , ever since I 've known you . JIM LUCAS Then why are you so troubled about it ? GEORGINA ALLERTON Because I 'm afraid you may feel quite differently about it , sitting out there in Reno for six weeks with plenty of time to think it over . Why do n't we wait and see if you still feel the same way when you come back to New York ? JIM LUCAS I 'm not coming back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the treadmill life you have to lead in them . I want to be able to breathe for once . I 'm going to find myself a place where I can see the stars and smell the earth . GEORGINA ALLERTON Yes , I 've often dreamed of that . Just running off somewhere , anywhere  --  and with you too ! JIM LUCAS Then why do n't you get on that plane with me tonight ? GEORGINA ALLERTON It 's not as simple as all that , Jim . People daydream about all sorts of things . But when you 're faced with actuality , you have to stop and think . If a man and woman are going to spend their lives together , they must have some plan , some way of living . JIM LUCAS Of course they do . But why ca n't it be a simple one ? Why ca n't we get ourselves a little farm , or a ranch ? We 'll work the land together , and work at other things too . I 've always wanted to paint , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , I do n't think I want to go on with that . Clark Redfield says my novel is a piece of tripe . JIM LUCAS Why do you pay any attention to him ? I 'll back my judgment of that book to the limit . It expresses all the things that you and I believe in , and beautifully too . Georgina , if you feel that you 'd rather not go with me now , Promise me at least that you 'll come out and join me when I 've got my decree . GEORGINA ALLERTON It all means too much to me , Jim , to be able to say yes , just like that . First , I want to be absolutely sure that this is right for both of us . JIM LUCAS Well , I 'm completely confident about your decision , because I know that this is meant to be . Well , I 've got to run along now and pick up my ticket . I wish I could see you again , before I leave , if only for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid I wo n't be free until after the theater . JIM LUCAS Well , my plane does n't leave until one . Why do n't you meet me at the air terminal about twelve and ride out to the airport with me ? The telephone rings . GEORGINA ALLERTON going to the telephone.Excuse me , Jim . Mermaid Bookshop . p. 87 As she answers the telephone the lights go up at right on MRS . ALLERTON , seated at the telephone in her negligee , as in Act One . A book is beside her . LUCY ALLERTON I have some news for you , Georgina . GEORGINA ALLERTON Oh , just a minute , please . Covering the transmitter . All right , Jim . I 'll be at the air terminal at twelve . JIM LUCAS Thank you , Georgina . He presses her free hand and exits . GEORGINA ALLERTON I 'm sorry , Mother . I had to get rid of a customer . LUCY ALLERTON That 's right . Do n't encourage them . Tell me , have you heard from Miriam ? GEORGINA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either ? GEORGINA ALLERTON No , why ? Is anything wrong ? LUCY ALLERTON On the contrary . They 're divorcing . Jim is leaving for Reno tonight . Miriam did n't want to go , and since Jim is at leisure again , we decided to ship him out . Of course , I 'm footing the bills ; but this is one expenditure poor old Grandpa would certainly have approved of . GEORGINA ALLERTON Well , I do n't approve . I think it 's awful . p. 88 LUCY ALLERTON I expected you would . That 's why I 'm calling you  --  to warn you not to try to upset things , in case Jim comes crying to you . GEORGINA ALLERTON What makes you think he has any intention of doing that ? LUCY ALLERTON Just a hunch . I suspect that it 's you he 's always been in love with . She sneezes . GEORGINA ALLERTON Why , Mother , how can you say things like that ! LUCY ALLERTON Well , maybe it 's just this irritation of my mucous membrane that makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , be careful not to say anything that will keep him off that plane . I only hope and pray that he 's subject to airsickness . A sneeze . Well , now that everything is settled I can get back to Opal . I certainly do envy that girl . GEORGINA ALLERTON Really , Mother ! LUCY ALLERTON I just do n't understand how she can spend so much time without any clothes on and not catch her death of cold . Well , good-by . GEORGINA ALLERTON Oh , I wo n't be home till late . I 'm having dinner out and going to the opening of The Merchant of Venice  --  and somewhere else afterward . LUCY ALLERTON Oh , I hope there 's a promising male involved . p. 89 GEORGINA ALLERTON No , there is n't . It 's just a boorish , conceited newspaperman in whom nobody could have the slightest interest . LUCY ALLERTON Sounds like a charming evening . GEORGINA ALLERTON Well , I have n't been to a first night in years . Besides , Hilda Vincent is playing Portia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is there in it for the young man ? GEORGINA ALLERTON I do n't know . I have n't any idea why he asked me , except that he 's sadistic and is planning to spend the evening making me feel uncomfortable . LUCY ALLERTON Well , it certainly looks as though Mr. Right had come along at last . Well , have fun . As she hangs up the lights fade on her . GEORGINA hangs up . She sits for a moment , steeped in gloom , then rises and picks up her hat . GEORGINA ALLERTON looking at the hat.No , not for that uncouth person . She replaces the hat on the desk and exits . The lights fade on the scene and come up at the center , on CLARK , seated at a table in Emilio 's , a modest Italian restaurant . He is munching a bread stick and listening to a Caruso record . GEORGINA ALLERTON entering as the record comes to an end.Sorry to be late . p. 90 CLARK REDFIELD half rising.Okay . I was just listening to Caruso and wondering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ALLERTON sitting at the table.That does n't happen to be my way of doing things . CLARK REDFIELD All right . Let 's not start fighting right away . We have the whole evening ahead of us . Calling . Oh , Luigi ! LUIGI entering.Yes , Meester Redfield . CLARK REDFIELD I think we 'll order now . To GEORGINA . How about a drink first ? GEORGINA ALLERTON I 'd like a Martini . CLARK REDFIELD Not with good Italian food . Look , do you mind if I do the ordering ? GEORGINA ALLERTON Of course not ! You know what I want much better than I do . CLARK REDFIELD Now you 're talking sense ! All right , Luigi , we 'll have a mixed Vermouth to start with  --  two parts dry and one part sweet , frapped and with a slice of lemon peel . LUIGI Okay , Meester Redfield . And some antipasto ? CLARK REDFIELD No , not all that miscellaneous stuff . Just those little bitter olives and some prosciutto. p. 91 LUIGI Then a little minestrone ? GEORGINA ALLERTON Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I had a huge lunch . CLARK REDFIELD to LUIGI.Yes , let 's have minestrone . Then some spaghetti . LUIGI Marinara ? CLARK REDFIELD No , Bolognese . And then how about a nice scallopini la Parmigiana ? LUIGI Ees very good ! CLARK REDFIELD No , wait a minute ! Let 's have the scallopini la Marsala . And eggplant Parmigiana with it . LUIGI Okay . GEORGINA ALLERTON I hope you 're not ordering all this for me , because I really  --   --  CLARK REDFIELD ignoring her.And a mixed green salad . Any zuppe Inglese tonight ? LUIGI I think so . CLARK REDFIELD Well , save a couple portions for us . GEORGINA ALLERTON tartly.You already ordered soup ! CLARK REDFIELD Soup ? Oh , you mean zuppe Inglese . Yes , literally English soup , but actually a kind of rum cake . What they call trifle in England . Depend on the English to make any kind of food sound unappetizing. p. 92 LUIGI And about the wine . Some Chianti ? Or maybe Lacrime Cristi ? CLARK REDFIELD Have you got any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few bottles . CLARK REDFIELD Let 's have that . All right , I think that 's all for the present . LUIGI Okay , Meester Redfield . He exits . GEORGINA ALLERTON What are we going to do with all that when it comes ? CLARK REDFIELD Eat it . I 'm not sure that the Falerno is better than the Lacrime Cristi , but it gives me a kick to drink a wine that is a lineal descendant of the Falernian of ancient Rome . Attica nectareum turbatis mella Falernum . Honey of Attica make thick the nectar-like Falernian . I forget who said it . Do you know ? GEORGINA ALLERTON No , I do n't . I went in for modern languages . Spanish and  --   --  CLARK REDFIELD I tried that once , thickening the wine with honey . But maybe I had the wrong formula . Or maybe the Romans had different tastes . So you 're a friend of Hilda Vincent 's ? GEORGINA ALLERTON Well , not a friend , exactly . We just happened to be at college together . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . p. 93 CLARK REDFIELD I know , the old school tie . GEORGINA ALLERTON Besides , I once played Portia . CLARK REDFIELD You what ? GEORGINA ALLERTON It was our high-school graduation play . Of course , it was only an amateur production , but I do n't think I did too badly . I still know the whole thing by heart . At that time I wanted very much to become an actress . CLARK REDFIELD Well , why did n't you ? GEORGINA ALLERTON Oh , I do n't know . My father wanted me to be a lawyer , so I just went along with that for a while . I even tried one semester at law school . Sighing . And now , of course , it 's too late to do anything about acting . CLARK REDFIELD So you turned to literature ? GEORGINA ALLERTON Let 's keep off that subject , if you do n't mind . CLARK REDFIELD Which reminds me that I 've brought back your novel . He produces a large envelope from under the table . GEORGINA ALLERTON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But it might have been a little more practical to have brought it back tomorrow , instead of lugging it all through dinner and theater. p. 94 CLARK REDFIELD Are n't you forgetting that you told me never to enter your shop again ? GEORGINA ALLERTON tight-lipped.You could have mailed it . CLARK REDFIELD weighing the envelope in his hand.A heck of a lot of postage . And suppose some little postal inspector had peeped into it ? Those poor devils have a hard enough life as it is . GEORGINA ALLERTON You said you were celebrating something tonight . Did some friend of yours die ? CLARK REDFIELD Well , it 's almost as good as that . Oliver Quinn is leaving the paper . GEORGINA ALLERTON I suppose I should know who Oliver Quinn is . CLARK REDFIELD Yes , you certainly should . He writes one of the three best sports columns in the country . GEORGINA ALLERTON Excuse my ignorance . But I never read the sports page  --   --  CLARK REDFIELD Yes , so you told me . But several million other people do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but still , as you 'll hear Portia say , later in the evening , God made them , so therefore let them pass for men . Well , anyhow , Oliver is leaving the paper to take the chair of Icelandic literature at the University of Michigan . That means promotions all along the line and an opening at the bottom , which the chief says is for me . As LUIGI enters . And here , opportunely , is Luigi , so we 'll drink to my good luck . He picks up the glass which LUIGI has set before him . LUIGI exits. p. 95 GEORGINA ALLERTON picking up her glass.Well , if you consider it good luck  --   --  CLARK REDFIELD I do indeed , and thanks for the toast . GEORGINA ALLERTON savoring the drink.This is quite good . CLARK REDFIELD Careful ! Do n't commit yourself . These olives go well with it . GEORGINA ALLERTON taking one.Thank you . CLARK REDFIELD And try a little of this raw ham . He helps her to some . GEORGINA ALLERTON I hope it does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ? GEORGINA ALLERTON It 's a horrible intestinal disorder you get from eating undercooked pork . CLARK REDFIELD Really ? Well , if we do get it , it will probably be the only thing we 'll ever have in common , so let 's go to it . He takes a large mouthful . GEORGINA ALLERTON I did n't believe that you were serious , this morning , about wanting to be a sportswriter . CLARK REDFIELD If I have a fault , Georgina , it 's that I incline to the serious side . p. 96 GEORGINA ALLERTON I ca n't understand it . People getting all excited about which team scores the most runs or who knocks out who . CLARK REDFIELD Nothing hard about that . Every time the champ comes up with a haymaker , forty thousand customers are taking a swing at the boss or the traffic cop . And when the King of Swat whams it into the bleachers , a million flatchested runts are right in there , whizzing around the bases . GEORGINA ALLERTON That 's nothing but escapism . CLARK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college who slam the door with Nora , take a nose dive into the brook with Ophelia , or tumble into a lot of Louis Quatorze beds with Opal . GEORGINA ALLERTON We 'll just pass over the personal implications and confine ourselves to the abstract question whether an interest in sports and an interest in literature  --   --  CLARK REDFIELD There is no such thing as an abstract discussion between a man and a woman . GEORGINA ALLERTON Well , that certainly reveals a narrow and conventional mind . CLARK REDFIELD Who 's getting personal now ? You see , every road we take leads right back to that novel of yours . p. 97 GEORGINA ALLERTON Will you stop harping on that ? What 's my novel got to do  --   --  ! I was certainly an idiot ever to show it to you . CLARK REDFIELD But you did ! And the reason you did was that you thought you 'd produced something creative and wanted to show it off . GEORGINA ALLERTON Nothing of the kind ! I mistook you for a literary critic and I wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mamma , showing off her baby and blindly oblivious to the fact that it was just an old rag doll with the straw stuffing coming through . Talk about escapism ! Why , there is n't a genuine moment in it  --  just a rehash of all the lady writers from Jane Austen to Virginia Woolf . GEORGINA ALLERTON All right , I 've heard enough about that ! CLARK REDFIELD That 's what you think ! My God , ca n't girl who 's been around for twenty-three or - four years find  --  GEORGINA ALLERTON Twenty-two , if you do n't mind . CLARK REDFIELD I do n't mind a bit . If you want to write , ca n't you produce something better than a lot of moony daydreaming about an idiotic young couple who ca n't bear escalators and modern plumbing and who go off to the great open spaces to live in simple , unwashed happiness among the mosquitoes and shad flies ? There 's a tasty dish for you  --  Love Among the Heifers : a pastoral in nine cantos , with costumes by Abercrombie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sound silly , if you 're stupid and literal about it . I happened to be writing a fantasy , about two sensitive people who find themselves hemmed in by the steel and stone of the city , and who can find freedom only in  --   --  CLARK REDFIELD Skip it ! Can you imagine any girl in her right mind behaving the way that heroine of yours does ? GEORGINA ALLERTON Yes , I can . If she cared enough about the man , why would n't she be willing to give up a lot of meaningless things for him ? CLARK REDFIELD What ! And go tooting off to some nebulous never-never land with that balmy Jim Lucas of a character . GEORGINA ALLERTON What 's Jim Lucas got to do with it ? CLARK REDFIELD That just slipped out . But it 's not so far off , at that . No wonder he thinks the story is a world-beater . Why , I 'm beginning to think that maybe he sat for that portrait . GEORGINA ALLERTON I hope I 'm not so literal-minded that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know ! Why bother to step outside and look at life , when it 's so cozy indoors and there 's always a shelf full of books handy ? For God 's sake , has n't anything ever happened to you ? Have you never been drunk ? Or socked a guy for making a pass at you ? Or lost your panties on Fifth Avenue ? p. 99 GEORGINA ALLERTON You think you 're going to make me lose my temper , do n't you ? Well , I 'm sorry to disappoint you , but you 're not . However , I do find you even more offensive than I had expected , so , if you 'll excuse me , I think I 'll just leave you to your splendid repast , while I  --   --  She starts to rise . CLARK REDFIELD pushing her back into her seat.You 'll certainly do nothing of the kind ! I told you I do n't like eating alone . And what 's more , I 'm going to protect these friends of mine here . They 're artists : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them . As LUIGI enters . Here 's Luigi now , with the minestrone and a dusty bottle of Falerno . Do you think I 'm going to have his feelings lacerated by having you walk out on the soup course ? No ! It 's time you learned some manners . GEORGINA ALLERTON aghast.I beg your pardon ! And to think that I turned down two other invitations to  --   --  ! CLARK REDFIELD Well , that was your mistake . Just as it was my mistake to pass up the Wilinski-O'Connell fight at the Garden . But since we are here , you 'll just have to see it through . You can say or do whatever you like to me , but I will not allow Emilio 's minestrone to be slighted. p. 100 LUIGI smiling , as he starts to serve the soup.Ees nice and hot . GEORGINA ALLERTON with great self-restraint.Very well , I shall eat the minestrone . LUIGI A leetle cheese , mees ? GEORGINA ALLERTON No , thank you . LUIGI distressed.Oh , ees no good weedout cheese . GEORGINA ALLERTON Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thank you , that 's very nice . CLARK REDFIELD A lot for me , Luigi . LUIGI beaming.Sure ting , Meester Redfield ! He serves CLARK and goes for the wine . CLARK REDFIELD They really do a beautiful minestrone here , do n't they ? GEORGINA eats her soup without replying . You 'd think I owned the joint , would n't you , the way I go on ? You ought to eat here three or four times a week and build yourself up . You 're too damned skinny . She throws him a look but does not reply . Personally , I find the natural curves of the female body quite appealing . As LUIGI approaches with the wine bottle . Ah , here we are ! Luigi , did you know that the ancient Romans drank this wine ? p. 101 LUIGI No , I did n't know . I come from Napoli . He fills the glasses and goes . CLARK REDFIELD sniffing the wine.I want you to taste this . But finish your soup first . I 'm glad to see you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are so busy gabbing that they just pick at their food . GEORGINA ALLERTON throws him a withering look . Apparently oblivious of it , he tears off a morsel of bread and pops it into his mouth . As they go on eating their soup the lights fade slowly on the scene . To the sound of a string quartet playing Elizabethan music , the lights come up dimly at the left on a section of a theater , consisting of eight or ten seats arranged in three rows . The seats face right and the stage of the theater is presumably off right , beyond the proscenium arch . The aisle of the theater runs right and left , downstage of the seats . All the seats are occupied , except the aisle pair in the first and third rows . After a moment an USHER enters at left , followed by CLARK and GEORGINA . CLARK has GEORGINA 'S script tucked under his arm . USHER stopping at the third row.First two on the aisle . She hands CLARK the stubs and programs and exits left . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the aisle . p. 102 GEORGINA ALLERTON Well , I 'm glad we 're not late . I hate to come in after the curtain is up . CLARK REDFIELD I knew a girl who was dropped from the Social Register for admitting that she had seen the first act of a play . She finally put an end to herself , by taking an overdose of caviar . GEORGINA ALLERTON Why do they come to the theater at all ? CLARK REDFIELD It fills that awkward gap between liqueurs and highballs . GEORGINA ALLERTON Please do n't mention food or drink again ! CLARK REDFIELD Good dinner , was n't it ? GEORGINA ALLERTON Oh , yes , the dinner was fine . CLARK REDFIELD There 's some reservation there . GEORGINA ALLERTON looking at her program.That 's lovely music . I wonder what it is . CLARK REDFIELD Sounds like Purcell . GEORGINA ALLERTON finding it in the program.Why it is Purcell ! CLARK REDFIELD Sorry ! I always seem to be saying the wrong thing . GEORGINA ALLERTON It 's certainly a mystery to me  --   --  She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Say it ! GEORGINA ALLERTON Well , it 's just that I do n't understand why a person who knows as much as you do has so little knowledge of human nature . CLARK REDFIELD You mean I have no knowledge of your nature ? GEORGINA ALLERTON I mean anybody 's nature ! Either that or what 's even worse , you take pleasure in making people feel uncomfortable . CLARK REDFIELD What are you uncomfortable about ? GEORGINA ALLERTON How would you like it if I had spent the whole evening harping on your shortcomings ? CLARK REDFIELD I might have found it very instructive . GEORGINA ALLERTON There you go again  --  implying that I am afraid to hear about my deficiencies . That 's not what I meant at all . CLARK REDFIELD Then what did you mean ? GEORGINA ALLERTON I mean that there are ways of saying things . No sensible person objects to having things pointed out in a  --   --  CLARK REDFIELD I see ! We 're back again on destructive versus constructive criticism . GEORGINA ALLERTON Yes , we are . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit , how you might improve yourself in certain respects  --   --  p. 104 CLARK REDFIELD In other words , you like to hear about your faults in a way that highlights your virtues . GEORGINA ALLERTON If I listened to you , I 'd soon believe that I did n't have any virtues . I do n't know anything . I ca n't do anything . I 'm just a total loss . Luckily , I do n't attach any importance to your opinion of me . CLARK REDFIELD Is that why you keep bringing it up ? GEORGINA ALLERTON indignantly.Well , what do you think I am , some kind of a jellyfish that 's just going to sit and let you  --   --  CLARK REDFIELD If you 'd ever tangled with a jellyfish you 'd know they 're anything but submissive creatures . She buries her nose in the program . The USHER comes down the aisle , followed by GEORGE HAND and a YOUNG WOMAN in a spectacular evening gown . The USHER stops beside the unoccupied row . USHER These two . GEORGE HAND as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . Why , hello , Georgina ! Fancy meeting you here ! GEORGINA ALLERTON Why , hello , George ! CLARK rises. p. 105 GEORGE HAND This is Miss Delehanty . Tessie , Miss Allerton . MISS DELEHANTY Hi ! GEORGINA ALLERTON How do you do ? And this is Mr. Redfield . Miss Delehanty , Mr. Hand . MISS DELEHANTY to CLARK.Hi ! GEORGE HAND shaking hands with CLARK.Are you the Redfield who writes those book reviews ? CLARK REDFIELD eying MISS DELEHANTY.Afraid so . GEORGINA ALLERTON But he does n't read the books . GEORGE HAND laughing.Well , thank God for that ! Think of what he 'd say if he did read them . Well , I guess we 'd better settle down , Tessie . MISS DELEHANTY Yeah ! She and HAND sit in the first row . CLARK REDFIELD sotto voce.What 's his name  --  Hand ? GEORGINA ALLERTON George Hand . He 's one of the biggest book jobbers in  --   --  CLARK REDFIELD Oh , yes ! I thought it rang a bell somewhere . p. 106 GEORGINA ALLERTON Something wrong about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books must be sold , there must be people to sell them . I 'll bet he catches hell from Tessie , when she finds out this is n't a musical . Well , I guess that accounts for one of the dinner dates you turned down . GEORGINA ALLERTON Yes , it does . And I almost wish I had n't . CLARK REDFIELD Why did you ? GEORGINA ALLERTON Because I already had accepted your invitation . CLARK REDFIELD You could have called me off . GEORGINA ALLERTON Well , that is certainly a gracious remark ! As a matter of fact , I would have , if I 'd known where to reach you . CLARK REDFIELD Always call the paper . If I 'm not there , somebody 's likely to know where I am . GEORGINA ALLERTON I 'll remember that  --  but I doubt that I 'll ever have any need for the information . CLARK REDFIELD They say this Hand is quite a chaser . GEORGINA ALLERTON Do they ? Well , I would n't know about that . CLARK REDFIELD I thought you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ? CLARK REDFIELD I do n't know . I get hunches like that sometimes . I have Indian blood in me . GEORGINA ALLERTON Well , in the future I wish you would please  --   --  The music comes to an end amid scattered applause . CLARK REDFIELD applauding.Sh ! Curtain going up ! The lights dim , except that GEORGINA 'S and CLARK 'S faces remain brightly lighted . They look off right , where a glow is now visible as the curtain presumably rises . There is scattered applause followed by a flourish of trumpets , and then the voices of the unseen actors of The Merchant of Venice are heard off right . ANTONIO In sooth , I know not why I am so sad:It wearies me ; you say it wearies you ; But how I caught it , found it , or came by it , What stuff ' t is made of , whereof it is born , I am to learn ; And such a want-wit sadness makes of me , That I have much ado to know myself . SALARINO Your mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argosies with portly sail , Like signiors and rich burghers on the flood , Or , as it were , the pageants of the sea , Do overpeer the petty traffickersThat curtsy to them , do them reverence , As they fly by them with their woven wings . p. 108 During the latter part of SALARINO 'S speech , his words grow fainter , as GEORGINA 'S attention wanders from the stage . She sits staring into space , and only a distant murmur of voices is now heard . After a moment the theater MANAGER , wearing a dinner jacket and looking for all the world like MR . ALLERTON , hurries on at the left , downstage of the seats . He makes straight for GEORGINA and leans across CLARK to speak to her . THEATER MANAGER tensely.Excuse me , are you Miss Georgina Allerton ? GEORGINA ALLERTON in surprise.Why , yes , I am . THEATER MANAGER I 'm the manager of the theater . Miss Hilda Vincent , who was to play Portia tonight , has just collapsed in her dressing room and  --   --  GEORGINA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --   --  ? THEATER MANAGER Well , I hope not . But she wo n't be able to go on . And we have no understudy . GEORGINA ALLERTON But what will you do ? THEATER MANAGER That 's what I 've come to see you about . GEORGINA ALLERTON Me ? THEATER MANAGER Yes , Miss Vincet is under the impression that you are familiar with the role of Portia  --  p. 109 GEORGINA ALLERTON Well , I did play it once . But that was in high school , years ago . THEATER MANAGER Are you up in the part ? GEORGINA ALLERTON Oh , I remember every word of it . But I could n't possibly go on and  --  THEATER MANAGER Well , wo n't you please help us out and try it ? GEORGINA ALLERTON hesitantly.Well , I do n't know . Turning to CLARK . Do you think I should , Clark ? CLARK REDFIELD laughing.Are you being funny ? You could n't get up there and act that part for a first-night audience . GEORGINA ALLERTON to the MANAGER.I guess he 's right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! It 's that or refunding thousands of dollars and sending away all these people disappointed . Miss Vincent told me to beg you in the name of your alma mater to  --   --  GEORGINA ALLERTON All right ! I will ! I 'll try it ! CLARK REDFIELD trying to detain her.You 'll make a fool of yourself ! GEORGINA ALLERTON pushing past him. I 'd rather be a fool than a coward . p. 110 THEATER MANAGER That 's the spirit , Miss Allerton ! I know you 'll come through . This way , please . Her head high , she follows him across the stage into the darkness at the right . The light fades out at the left , then there is scattered applause , followed by the voice of the MANAGER , off right . Ladies and gentlemen , I regret to inform you that Miss Hilda Vincent , who was to be seen as Portia tonight , will be unable to appear . Murmurs and exclamations from the unseen audience . However , there happens to be in the audience a young lady , Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is familiar with the role , and has graciously consented to replace Miss Vincent . Scattered applause and murmurs . CLARK REDFIELD loudly.Boo ! THEATER MANAGER I am sure you will show Miss Allerton every indulgence , in view of the fact that she is going on at a moment 's notice , and without even a rehearsal . I thank you Applause , followed by a flourish of music . Then the lights come up at right , on a small section of an elevated stage . GEORGINA , in the dress of a Venetian doctor of laws , stands on the stage , facing the spectators at left , among whom only CLARK can be seen , as a spotlight focuses on his face . He grins sardonically as GEORGINA begins to speak . GEORGINA ALLERTON The quality of mercy is not strain 'd ; It droppeth as the gentle rain from heavenUpon the place beneath . It is twice blest  --  It blesseth him that gives , and him that takes . ' T is mightiest in the mightiest . It becomesThe throned monarch better than his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attribute to awe and majesty , Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings ; But mercy is above this sceptred sway ; It is enthroned in the hearts of kings , It is an attribute to God himself ; And earthly power doth then show likest God'sWhen mercy seasons justice . Therefore , Jew , Though justice be thy plea , consider this  --  That , in the course of justice , none of usShould see salvation : we do pray for mercy , And that same prayer doth teach us all torenderThe deeds of mercy p. 111 As the speech goes on , CLARK 'S expression begins to soften until at the end he is moved almost to tears . When the speech is finished there is an outburst of applause , cheers , and cries of " Bravo ! " CLARK sniffles , then takes out a handkerchief and blows his nose . GEORGINA bows , smiles , and blows kisses to the unseen audience . Two ushers cross quickly from left to right , carrying huge bouquets which they hand up to GEORGINA . Her arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappears . There is another upsurge of applause as the lights fade out at right . Then CLARK springs to his feet as he sees GEORGINA approaching from the right and meets her stage center . CLARK REDFIELD Georgina ! You were magnificent ! GEORGINA ALLERTON as they go toward their seats.Do n't try to flatter me . I know you do n't mean it . CLARK REDFIELD But I do ! I swear to you I do ! You were superb : sincere , moving , eloquent , forceful , charming . GEORGINA ALLERTON That 's a lot , is n't it , for a girl who does n't know anything , a girl who ca n't do anything ? CLARK REDFIELD I take it all back , Georgina  --  every word of it . I 've done you an injustice , completely misunderstood you  --  p. 112 GEORGINA ALLERTON Next time , maybe you 'll be a little more careful . Only I 'm afraid there 'll be no next time for you , as far as I 'm concerned . They are seated by now . CLARK REDFIELD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ? GEORGINA ALLERTON Yes , and a good riddance too . PORTIA off right.A gentle riddance . Draw the curtains , go . Let all of his complexion choose me so . There is applause as the unseen curtain falls . As the lights come up again at the left GEORGINA , startled , begins to applaud . The Elizabethan music is resumed and continues throughout . CLARK REDFIELD to GEORGINA.Well , I 'm glad you 're back with us . The other spectators begin to rise and file out . GEORGINA ALLERTON It 's good , is n't it ? CLARK REDFIELD Why , I do n't believe you heard a word of it . GEORGINA ALLERTON indignantly.Why , I heard every syllable . What do you mean  --   --  ? CLARK REDFIELD Go on ! You were off in some Cloud-Cuckoo-Land. p. 113 GEORGINA ALLERTON I was nothing of the kind ! CLARK REDFIELD looking toward HAND and MISS DELEHANTY.Sh ! We must n't give them the impression that we 're not en rapport . Besides , I 'm dying to know how Tessie interprets the casket plot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and GEORGINA.Say , that Vincent girl is a good Portia , is n't she ? Why , to meet her at a cocktail party , you 'd never think she had it in her . CLARK REDFIELD The world is full of girls like that . You have to live with them to know them . Miss Delehanty , how about a cigarette ? MISS DELEHANTY Yeah , why not ? CLARK REDFIELD as they go left.Well , there might be a number of reasons . Let 's look at it , first , from the purely esthetic angle  --   --  He and MISS DELEHANTY exit . GEORGE HAND So you turned me down for a book reviewer ! GEORGINA ALLERTON I had already said yes to him when you  --   --  GEORGE HAND Never mind , I can take it . But remember , we 're playing a return engagement tomorrow at the Canard Rouge . I 've dug up a lot more dope about Mexico . It seems that  --   --  p. 114 GEORGINA ALLERTON Save it until tomorrow . We really should join the others . GEORGE HAND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of brash , this Redfield , is n't he ? GEORGINA ALLERTON Oh , yes  --  very ! As they exit the lights fade on the scene and the music changes to a jazz rhythm . The lights come up , center , on a table in a night club . A HEADWAITER appears , at left , followed by GEORGINA and CLARK , who still carries the script . HEADWAITER How about this ? CLARK REDFIELD Yes , this 'll do . He and GEORGINA seat themselves at the table . HEADWAITER Can I take your order ? GEORGINA ALLERTON Nothing for me . I 've only got about a half-hour  --  CLARK REDFIELD That 's time enough for a drink . Scotch and soda ? GEORGINA ALLERTON Now , do n't spoil things by beginning to ask me what I want . CLARK REDFIELD to the HEADWAITER.Two Scotches and soda . And two smoked whitefish sandwiches on rye toast . GEORGINA ALLERTON Do you really think you can eat two sandwiches ? p. 115 CLARK REDFIELD to the HEADWAITER.Well , just bring one to start with . HEADWAITER Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an end . CLARK REDFIELD Now we can really relax and talk things over . GEORGINA ALLERTON I could n't relax even if we had anything to talk over . I do n't know why I let you drag me here , when I have to  --   --  CLARK REDFIELD I know ! I 've got my eye glued on the time . Where is it that you have to be at midnight , Cinderella ? GEORGINA ALLERTON My , but you ask a lot of questions , do n't you ? CLARK REDFIELD Newspaperman . Get the story or get another job . GEORGINA ALLERTON Well , if you must know , I 'm going to the airport to see somebody off . CLARK REDFIELD Good ! I 'll go with you ! GEORGINA ALLERTON You 'll do nothing of the sort . CLARK REDFIELD Well , that 's settled ! He suddenly laughs aloud . GEORGINA ALLERTON vexed.Am I missing something again ? p. 116 CLARK REDFIELD I 'm thinking of George Hand . GEORGINA ALLERTON What 's so funny about that ? CLARK REDFIELD On the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were bound for , and I said we were going to the Blue Grotto and why did n't he join us there . I can just see him turning that gloomy joint upside down in search of us , while Miss Delehanty sits wrapped in her thoughts  --  the naked creature ! GEORGINA ALLERTON Well , of all the adolescent  --   --  ! She laughs in spite of herself . I 'm only laughing at the picture of Miss Delehanty  --   --  CLARK REDFIELD It 's all right . Do n't apologize . Is this George Hand trying to seduce you ? GEORGINA ALLERTON Heavens , who 's talking book language now ? CLARK REDFIELD Well , I 've learned that I must n't always use the first word that springs to my lips . Of course , if you 'd rather I asked you if he 's trying to  --   --  GEORGINA ALLERTON hastily.No , I would n't ! He 's asked me to go to Mexico with him . You can put your own interpretation on that . CLARK REDFIELD I have . It does n't worry me. p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ REDFIELD I 've just told you it does n't . I mean it 's not what 's worrying you either . GEORGINA ALLERTON Who said anything was worrying me ? CLARK REDFIELD preoccupied.Nobody . Tell me something , Georgina . Are you a virgin ? GEORGINA ALLERTON Did n't you say that the Newspaper Guild limits your working hours ? CLARK REDFIELD thoughtfully.It really does n't matter much . Well , I 'm glad we went to that play . Because suddenly everything clicked . Do you remember my telling you that you were off in a trance ? GEORGINA ALLERTON I was off in some Cloud-Cuckoo-Land , you said . CLARK REDFIELD Yes . I happened to look at you and I saw that you were no longer Georgina Allerton , that college grad who plays at running a bookshop . You were suddenly being somebody up there on the stage , who was pretending to be Portia of Belmont who was pretending to be a doctor of laws in an imaginary Venetian court of justice . GEORGINA ALLERTON Well , that 's what art is supposed to do for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with  --   --  p. 118 CLARK REDFIELD No ! Art should reveal reality to us . It should n't be something that we use to screen ourselves from reality . GEORGINA ALLERTON Is that what you 're trying to tell me  --  that I hide from reality ? CLARK REDFIELD Yes . Sitting there beside you in the theater and looking at you  --   --  GEORGINA ALLERTON Were n't you interested in the play ? CLARK REDFIELD What 's that got to do with it ? GEORGINA ALLERTON I was wondering what made you look at me . CLARK REDFIELD Let 's stick to the point , please . GEORGINA ALLERTON I 'm sorry ! CLARK REDFIELD The point is that you 're a daydreamer . You live in a world of fantasy instead of the world of reality . GEORGINA ALLERTON What is this reality you keep talking about ? CLARK REDFIELD I was hoping you would n't ask me that because I 'm not sure that I know the answer . But I 'm pretty sure it means living your life out and not dreaming it away . GEORGINA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't it as real as something you do ? p. 119 CLARK REDFIELD Because dreaming is easy and life is hard . Because when you dream you make your own rules , but when you try to do something , the rules are made for you by the limitations of your own nature and the shape of the world you live in . Because no matter how much you win in your dreams , your gains are illusory , and you always come away empty-handed . But in life , whether you win or lose , you 've always got something to show for it  --  even if it 's only a scar or a painful memory . GEORGINA ALLERTON Scars are ugly and pain hurts . CLARK REDFIELD Without ugliness , there would be no beauty . And if you 're afraid to know pain , you 'll never know the value of pleasure . GEORGINA ALLERTON You 're a tough guy , are n't you ? CLARK REDFIELD Well , I 've had to fight my own way through life , ever since I can remember . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GEORGINA ALLERTON It 's not the way I was brought up . I always had people to protect me . CLARK REDFIELD If you bandage a muscle long enough , it withers . And that goes for your emotions too . If you keep smothering them with dreams , they 'll die after a while . GEORGINA ALLERTON Do n't say it . It 's what I 'm afraid of . p. 120 CLARK REDFIELD Then it 's time somebody said it . GEORGINA ALLERTON I know . Push her off the dock and she 'll learn to swim . But suppose I 'm not the one that gets tough . Suppose I 'm that one that goes under . CLARK REDFIELD All right then . If that 's the way you feel about it , go on sitting on the end of the dock for the rest of your life and let the moonbeams turn your blood to water . GEORGINA ALLERTON No , I must n't do that , must I ? Keep on telling me . I must n't do that . Only what do you do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suppose  --  well , suppose you cared very much for someone . Could n't get him out of your thoughts , day or night . And all the while you knew it was hopeless , knew you could never have him . But still you went on , weeping and longing and dreaming . And then , just like that , what you thought could never be suddenly became possible . What you had prayed for was yours for the asking . Only it was all different  --  not a bit the way you dreamed it . And he was different too . But it was reality ; it was no longer a dream . And that 's your recipe  --  reality . So that 's what I go for , according to you . CLARK REDFIELD Not according to me at all . GEORGINA ALLERTON But you said  --   --  p. 121 CLARK REDFIELD I said live your life . Lots of people have a beautiful time , yearning unhappily for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow . But when the rainbow fades , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't have to hug it to their bosoms . They can leave it be and say , " Well , looks like I staked out the wrong claim . " That is , if they have any guts and any sense of humor they can . If you can make a dream come to life , grab hold of it . But if it dies on you , roll up your sleeves and give it a decent burial , instead of trying to haul the corpse around with you . The band begins to play another dance tune . GEORGINA ALLERTON rising.Thank you , teacher . CLARK REDFIELD also rising.Do you have to go already ? GEORGINA ALLERTON Well , the bus to the airport wo n't wait . CLARK REDFIELD Why is it so important that you go ? GEORGINA ALLERTON I told you I 'd promised somebody I 'd see them off . CLARK REDFIELD What would happen if you did n't ? GEORGINA ALLERTON Nothing would happen , I guess . Except that they might be disappointed . CLARK REDFIELD as the waiter appears with the drinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll have to eat and drink alone , and I 've told you I do n't like that . p. 122 GEORGINA ALLERTON hesitantly.Well , if I do n't go , I should at least phone the air terminal and say I 'm not coming . The waiter exits . CLARK REDFIELD Why ? If you do n't show up , they 'll figure out that you 're not there . GEORGINA ALLERTON Yes , I suppose that 's true . CLARK REDFIELD Of course , if you enjoy unnecessary telephone conversations  --  GEORGINA ALLERTON No , I really do n't . CLARK REDFIELD resuming his seat.Then let 's sit down . GEORGINA ALLERTON complying.I wonder why I listen to you . CLARK REDFIELD I have a magnetic personality . Raising his glass . God , I 've talked my throat dry . Here 's to you . GEORGINA ALLERTON raising her glass.And here 's to you . I 'm sorry your throat is dry , but I 'm glad you talked to me . Do you mind telling me why ? CLARK REDFIELD with a shrug.I do n't know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legs walking around in a trance . Taking a bite of the sandwich . Say , this is damned good ! p. 123 GEORGINA ALLERTON Could I have a bite ? CLARK REDFIELD pushing the plate over.Why , sure ! Maybe I 'd better order another one . GEORGINA ALLERTON No , let 's finish this one first . Taking a bite . It is good . You 're always right , are n't you ? CLARK REDFIELD About ninety per cent of the time . Well  --  say , ninety-five . I hope I 'm right about that Wilinski-O'Connell fight . I 'm backing Wilinski on the short end of a two-to-one bet . GEORGINA ALLERTON her mouth full.It 's too bad you did n't go . CLARK REDFIELD Oh , that 's all right . This is fun , for a change . GEORGINA ALLERTON Gee , thanks . CLARK REDFIELD You should eat more . You 're too skinny . GEORGINA ALLERTON You told me that before . CLARK REDFIELD looking at her.Jim Lucas ? GEORGINA ALLERTON startled.What ? CLARK REDFIELD You heard me . I said Jim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? CLARK REDFIELD I have a knack for putting one and one together . GEORGINA ALLERTON He 's going to Reno to get a divorce . CLARK REDFIELD Well , what the hell else would anybody go to Reno for ? GEORGINA ALLERTON He wants me to join him there . CLARK REDFIELD And are you going to ? GEORGINA ALLERTON Maybe . CLARK REDFIELD Say , I 'd like to have a piece of the agency that handles your travel arrangements . And if you do get there , what then ? GEORGINA ALLERTON We 'd get married and get ourselves a ranch . CLARK REDFIELD A ranch . Suddenly . My God , it 's right straight out of that novel of yours . GEORGINA ALLERTON Just pushing the girl off the dock is n't enough for you . You have to kick her off . Rising . Get up ! CLARK REDFIELD Why ? GEORGINA ALLERTON I feel like dancing . CLARK REDFIELD With me ? p. 125 GEORGINA ALLERTON Well , I 'm a shy girl . I 'd feel funny about accosting some stranger . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon with whom . GEORGINA ALLERTON You have a charming way of saying things . Years of experience , I suppose . They dance back and forth across the stage , a spotlight following them . CLARK REDFIELD Well , working on a newspaper , you get around . GEORGINA ALLERTON That 's what I mean . CLARK REDFIELD Your eyes are n't too bad either . GEORGINA ALLERTON Now do n't feel that you have to overdo it . CLARK REDFIELD That 's a sound criticism . Overstatement is one of my worst faults . GEORGINA ALLERTON I 'm sure you have plenty of bad ones . CLARK REDFIELD Well  --  enough . GEORGINA ALLERTON Is that why no girl has ever married you ? CLARK REDFIELD I 've never asked one to . GEORGINA ALLERTON Never met anyone worthy , I suppose . CLARK REDFIELD That 's partly it . But it 's also because I think I 'd make a lousy husband . p. 126 GEORGINA ALLERTON Would you ? Why ? CLARK REDFIELD Well , in the first place  --  Breaking off . Do you really want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something to talk about . CLARK REDFIELD We would n't have to talk . GEORGINA ALLERTON That 's true . Only you do n't seem very happy when you 're not talking . CLARK REDFIELD Well , that 's the first thing . I 'm gabby . GEORGINA ALLERTON Maybe that 's because you really have a lot of things to say . CLARK REDFIELD That does n't follow . The world is full of windbags . Then again , I 'm blunt and caustic . I come right out with things . GEORGINA ALLERTON That might be honesty . CLARK REDFIELD As for egotism  --  that 's my middle name . GEORGINA ALLERTON It 's a quality that a lot of creative people seem to have . CLARK REDFIELD I 'm a hard guy to know . GEORGINA ALLERTON Complex people usually are . CLARK REDFIELD I 'm lacking in reverence p. 127 GEORGINA ALLERTON It could be that you 're too penetrating to be taken in by sham . CLARK REDFIELD It bores me to listen to other people 's troubles . GEORGINA ALLERTON Perhaps you think they should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . CLARK REDFIELD The idea of supporting a wife irks me . GEORGINA ALLERTON A man who is independent himself might not respect an able-bodied woman who was willing to be a dependent . CLARK REDFIELD I 'm an unpredictable bastard . If I have a strong impulse , I 'm as likely as not to follow it . GEORGINA ALLERTON That could denote imagination and courage . The music comes to an end . They stop dancing and applaud mechanically , both transfused with new-found emotion . CLARK REDFIELD You dance all right . GEORGINA ALLERTON Thank you . So do you . CLARK REDFIELD as they go back to the table.Why do n't we order another drink ? GEORGINA ALLERTON seating herself.That 's a wonderful idea . p. 128 CLARK REDFIELD You order it . I want to make some phone calls . Fishing in his pockets . Have you got any nickels ? You know how I always get stuck in phone booths without nickels . GEORGINA ALLERTON opening her handbag.I think I have . How many do you want ? CLARK REDFIELD Oh , three or four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't forget to order the drinks . GEORGINA ALLERTON I wo n't . CLARK REDFIELD Oh , better order another sandwich too . GEORGINA ALLERTON All right , I will . CLARK REDFIELD picking up the remains of his sandwich.I may as well finish this , while I 'm phoning . He takes a bite as he exits . As GEORGINA sits gazing after him the lights fade out on the scene . A persistent knocking is heard offstage right . The lights come up center on the empty stage . A MAN in slippers and an old-fashioned nightshirt comes on at left , carrying a lighted kerosene lamp . He looks like MR . ALLERTON . JUSTICE OF THE PEACE BILLINGS peering off right as the knocking continues.Consarn it all , who 's there ? p. 129 CLARK REDFIELD off.Is Justice of the Peace Billings in ? JUSTICE OF THE PEACE BILLINGS Where in tarnation do you think I 'd be this time of night ? CLARK REDFIELD off.Well , open up and let us in . JUSTICE OF THE PEACE BILLINGS What in thunder for ? CLARK REDFIELD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BILLINGS Well , jiminy crickets , ca n't you wait till mornin ' ? CLARK REDFIELD off.No , we ca n't . It 's an emergency . JUSTICE OF THE PEACE BILLINGS as he goes off right.Some folks ai n't got the sense they was born with . A sound of bolts opening and a door creaking . Then BILLINGS reappears , followed by CLARK and GEORGINA . CLARK REDFIELD producing a paper.Here 's the license , Judge . Now give us the works . JUSTICE OF THE PEACE BILLINGS peering at the license as a cuckoo clock sounds two.Well , I 'll be danged ! Two o'clock . Time you young folks was in bed , ' stead of gallivantin ' around . p. 130 CLARK REDFIELD We know it . But we thought we ought to get married first . JUSTICE OF THE PEACE BILLINGS reading the license.Do you , Georgina Allerton , aim to take this bachelor , Clark Redfield , to be your lawful wedded husband ? GEORGINA ALLERTON I do . JUSTICE OF THE PEACE BILLINGS And do you , Clark Redfield , hanker to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wedded wife ? CLARK REDFIELD That 's what I 'm here for . JUSTICE OF THE PEACE BILLINGS To love and to cherish . To honor and to obey . CLARK REDFIELD No ! GEORGINA ALLERTON simultaneously.No ! JUSTICE OF THE PEACE BILLINGS What 's that ? CLARK REDFIELD Cut out that " obey . " JUSTICE OF THE PEACE BILLINGS grumpily.It 's part o ' the ceremony . Folks ai n't expected to take it serious . GEORGINA ALLERTON We 're very serious people  --  very serious and very honest . JUSTICE OF THE PEACE BILLINGS When I do the marryin ' , I do n't want no back talk . In sickness and in health . In joy and in sorrow . Until death do you part . p. 131 CLARK REDFIELD I do . Georgina . I  --   --  She stops as a clatter of horse 's hoofs is heard off left . JIM LUCAS off.Whoa ! The hoofbeats stop and JIM rushes on , dressed as a cowboy . No ! No ! Stop ! GEORGINA ALLERTON Jim ! CLARK REDFIELD Oh , so you 're here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! And just in the nick of time , it seems . CLARK REDFIELD What do you want ? JIM LUCAS ignoring him.Georgina , do you realize what you 're doing ? GEORGINA ALLERTON Well , not altogether , Jim . But it gives me such a wonderful feeling , as though I were really alive for the first time . JIM LUCAS You 're just yielding to a romantic impulse , just throwing yourself away . CLARK REDFIELD to JIM.You keep out of this , Lucas . You 're all washed up , as far as this girl is concerned ; and I 'm taking over now . JIM LUCAS Answer him , Georgina ! GEORGINA ALLERTON I do n't know what to say . I never met anyone like him before . He 's a tough guy  --  he really is . He scares the daylights out of me. p. 132 JIM LUCAS All right . I 'll answer him then . To CLARK . She 's mine  --  mine ! Do you understand ? CLARK REDFIELD How do you figure that ? JIM LUCAS Because she loves me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's built her whole secret life around me  --  yearning , dreaming , hoping against hope . And now I 'm free and I want her , and I 'm going to make her mine . GEORGINA ALLERTON to CLARK.It 's true what he 's saying . He wants me , and I 've always loved him and  --  CLARK REDFIELD Scuttlebutt ! He does n't know what he wants and never will . And you do n't love him and never did . You 've just been in love with some Romeo of your imagination , that never was on land or sea . GEORGINA ALLERTON Do you think so ? Do you think that 's the way it is ? JIM LUCAS Do n't listen to him , Georgina . GEORGINA ALLERTON I have to listen to him , Jim . He may be right . He is  --  ninety-five per cent of the time . JUSTICE OF THE PEACE BILLINGS impatiently.Well , young lady , I 'm goin ' back to bed . The law do n't require me to stay up all night , waitin ' for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ALLERTON No , wait ! It 's true . I 've got to make up my mind . If I do n't now , I never will . All right , Judge , proceed with the ceremony . JUSTICE OF THE PEACE BILLINGS Well , that 's better . Do you , Georgina Allerton  --   --  JIM LUCAS No , Georgina . You must n't do this . JUSTICE OF THE PEACE BILLINGS You keep out of this , young feller , unless you want to spend the night in the lockup . CLARK REDFIELD Go on , cowboy . Beat it . JIM looks appealingly at GEORGINA , but she averts her head , and he exits dolefully . GEORGINA ALLERTON All right . I 'm ready . In sickness and in health . In joy and in sorrow . Until death  --  She breaks off as the jazz music from the night club blares forth . No , no ! Stop it , Georgina ! You must n't go on like this ! You must n't ! CLARK and BILLINGS have gone , and as the nightclub scene appears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm at it again  --  drugging myself with dreams . And when I come to , all I 'll get from him is a slap in the face . He does n't care a damn for me . He 's just having fun with me  --  just giving me the run-around , that 's all . He 's calling up to find out if he won his bet on Wilinski  --  that means more to him than I do . Springing to her feet . No , I ca n't take it ! I 'll never see him again . I 'll go before he gets back . I 'll  --  I 'll  --  oh , I do n't know . Anything  --  anything not to hear the bitter truth from him . She starts to exit. p. 134 CLARK REDFIELD entering.I won ! Wilinski knocked him out in the  --   --  Looking at her . You look as though you think you 're going somewhere . GEORGINA ALLERTON Yes , I am . Good-by , and congratulate Wilinski for me . CLARK REDFIELD We 'll send him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm going to take a taxi to the airport and get on that plane with Jim . CLARK REDFIELD Why ? GEORGINA ALLERTON Because you 've convinced me that doing something is better than doing nothing . And if I do n't go away with Jim , I have n't anything . CLARK REDFIELD Well , of course , if that 's what you want to do ! Only I wish you 'd told me just a few minutes sooner . GEORGINA ALLERTON What do you mean by that ? CLARK REDFIELD Well , you know those impulses I get . I suddenly decided to round off the evening by blowing in that dough I won on Wilinski . So I ordered one of those rented limousines to come around and pick us up . The guy wears a peaked cap and gauntlets . It 's pretty damned impressive . GEORGINA ALLERTON Where were you planning to go ? p. 135 CLARK REDFIELD Oh , I thought we could decide that as we went along . We could whirl around Central Park a couple of times , and then maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond . It 's a nice night for a ride , and , sitting back in a car , you get a chance to talk .
