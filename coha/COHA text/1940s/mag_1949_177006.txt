Forward the Heart ( by Bernard Reines ; produced by Theatre Enterprises , Inc . &; Leon J. Bronesky ) attempts to treat a compound social fracture-always a ticklish business . Playwright Reines 's double-problem play first shows a young painter who has been blinded in the War and is bitterly unadjusted . Only when he falls in love with his mother 's sympathetic , intelligent young maid does life seem worth living . Then he discovers that the maid is a Negro . <P> Horrified for a moment , he finds that he still loves her and wants to marry her . She , in spite of loving him , knows better about marriage-much better after she overhears his mother 's fierce , shocked remonstrances . He alone refuses to give up , and when the girl goes away , he makes plans to find her . <P> A deeply earnest play , Forward the Heart is now &; then a dramatic one . In the main roles , William Prince ( The Eve of St. Mark , John Loves Mary ) does well enough and Mildred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Free ) very well . Yet Forward the Heart sharply fails . It mingles two such general problems as race and rehabilitation to produce the most special of stories-one that calls less for earnestness than intensity . It is a story to be treated , if at all , in terms of tragic irony rather than realistic protest . As realism , the play can no more achieve an artistic resolution than it can supply a practical answer . As realism , it also suffers a good deal from very seldom seeming real . Author Reines is always too conscious of his social issues , too ready with a speech . What is most disastrous of all , the actual writing is far too often inept .
