txt DeveP opments over the week-end indicate that District Attorr.ey Thomas E. Dewey of New York Is facing formidable opposition for the Republican nomination for President . The out . come is exceedingly droblemai.ical . In the public eye at the moment Dewey is the outstanding Republican candidate . The dashing 38 year old Zang buster , with the musical voice Ind the punch in every paragraph , is the glamor boy of . the G. 0 . P. Defeating Senator . Arthur H. Vandenberg of Michigan In the Wisconsin and Nebraska primaries and polling an impressive vote , unopposed , in Illinois , Dewey stands forth as the champion vote getter of his party in ' het 1940 presidential contest . G. 0 . P. Needs New York . By this performance Dewey has been popularly acclaimed as the Republican candidate ' preeminently qualified to outrun any Democrat , not excepting President Roosevelt , in the November election and the only one who could be depended upon to carry New York against the President . And to win the battle it is essential fog the Republicans to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now that the smoke has cleared away from these primary victories . however , it Is seen that Dewey 's path to tile nomination Is far from a walkaway . Ills speeches and other public appearances in the next month or two may produce a band wagon movement that will carry him to nomination . Backers Consider Defeat . But many Republican leaders , including some of his own partisans . are conxinced that unless he wins on the first or second ballot , Dewey will be defeated  --  at least for first place . As matters now stand , and barring a Dewey band wagon movement , It does not appear likely that any candidates will have a majority of the 1,000 delegates on  --  the first ballot . The 175 delegates presumably won by Dewey in the New York , Wisconsin , Nebraska , and Illinois primaries already have begun to melt away . He apparently was assured of 77 of the 92 New York delegates , but as a resuit of the internal party dissension revolving around the feud of Dewey and National Committeeman Kenneth Simpson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Switch to Vandenberg . A considerable number of Illinois ' 58 , Wisconslr 's ' 24 , and Nebraska 's 14 delegates have made known that , they : will vote for Dewey on one ballot only , going probably to Vandenberg . Senator Robert A. Taft of Ohio predicts that he will lead the first ballot with close to 400 delegates . Unlike Dewey and Vandenberg , Taft has kept out of the presidential primaries ? outside of his own state In which ho Is unopposed . He has specialized on ' proselyting for delegates in the states in which delegates are chosen not by the people directly but by conventions and party leaders . The Taft organization claims to have nailed down 317 votes from about 20 states . It is not unlikely that Dewey and Taft will be the leading contenders on the first ballot . As leaders in the Vandenberg camp view it , Taft and Dewey will kill off each other as Gen. Leonard Wood and Frank Lowden did at Chicago in 1920 , after which the convention will turn to Vandenberg for the nominee . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
