The W  --  rld 's Most Famous Optimists By ERNEST 0 . HAUSER HE story is told of a man who came rushing up to the barrier at Lloyd 's in London and de- manded to see an underwriter , quick . Taking note of the visitor 's great state of alarm , the red-robed attendant stopped one of the insurance brokers who was on his way to lunch . " And what can I do for you ? " queried the broker politely . " An insurance policy , " whispered the visitor . " I want to take out an insurance against twins , " " Twins ? Of course  --  and when do you expect the blessed event ? " " Right away , sir , " exclaimed the man . " Right away . There 's not a minute to losel " Lloyd 's did not oblige  --  the customer should have approached them at least five months sooner . As for the proposition itself  --  Lloyd 's underwriters do issue policies against twins and , over a period of years , have made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't born . Word has got around , in the last two and a half centuries , that Lloyd 's , London , will insure almost anything , and hardly a day goes by in which this center of the world insurance trade is not approached by someone residing in Anchorage , Alaska , or Capetown , South Africa , or New York , New York , with a courteously worded request for an entirely novel form of policy ; and if the applicant has an " insurable interest " and can pay his premium , he 'll receive that policy by return mail . To break new ground , to pioneer where others shunned the risk , has been one of the principal functions of this fabulous institution ; many of the standard forms of insurance now in use all over the world were invented at Lloyd 's . The only reason Lloyd 's did not foot the bill for the destruction of Pompeii by Mount Vesuvius is that this calamity preceded the founding of Lloyd 's . More recently , it is fair to state , few catastrophes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lloyd 's being affected . The San Francisco fire , the sinking of the Titanic , the burning of the airship Hindenburg , the death of Will Rogers , the U-boat sinkings in the Caribbean , the Ringling-circus fire , the flying bombs  --  all these have cost Lloyd 's a pretty penny . And the fact that Lloyd 's has not collapsed under the staggering weight of the world 's accumulated woe proves that there 's money in optimism . Indeed , Lloyd 's , London , is the world 's outstanding example of the triumph of Pandora 's box over the forces of evil . Do n't go looking for your local branch office though . There is only one Lloyd 's . Any London cabby will take you there ; just tell him " Lloyd 's , " and he 'll let you off in front of the narrow , marble-coated facade of No. 12 , Leadenhall Street , just between St. Mary Axe and Beehive Passage , in the midst of the maze of tangled alleys that is the City , and a stone 's throw from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England . Inside , you 'll find an unexpectedly spacious hall , known throughout the world simply as " The Room . " Here , the famous Caller , dressed in his resplendent red robe , stands on his rostrum under the Lutine bell , singing out names and making announcements over the microphone . Around him , some 300 underwriters , seated in boxes , say yes or no to requests for insurance . // As for the insurance-hungry public , it is n't there ; like a high court which lends its ear to specially appointed barristers only , Lloyd 's does business with a select and exclusive group of brokers  --  you can see them as you peer across the barrier , walking back and forth between the boxes and talking turkey with the underwriters . These boxes consist of rough tables and exceedingly uncomfortable , narrow wooden benches  --  a hang-over from the seventeenth century , when Lloyd 's was still a coffeehouse . To this day , the red-robed attendants throughout the building answer to the call " Waiter ! " Endless as the catalogue of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Room today . When the Magna Charts was exhibited at the New York World 's Fair , it was insured at Lloyd 's for ? 100,000 . Until the outbreak of the war , Adolf Hitler himself was among Lloyd 's customers ; a special policy covered each passenger in the Fiihrer 's personal Junkers transport plane against accident or sudden death . Having largely concentrated for two centuries on marine insurance , where the risk was the immediate danger of a specific voyage to ship and cargo , Lloyd 's started going in for other risks on a broad front some fifty years ago ; today , these other risks outweigh Lloyd 's marine policies by a considerable margin . True , the bulk of this business remains routine  --  buildings and goods are insured against fire , railroads are covered against public liability . But no risk is too small or too out of the way for a Lloyd 's man to accept , and there is nothing to stop you from taking out a Lloyd 's policy covering your losses in the event , however remote , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lloyd 's insured the fishmongers of Fish Street Hill against the somewhat remote , but nevertheless conceivable , contingency of the London Monument crashing down upon their houses . Lloyd 's insured a London menagerie keeper , who had promised to pay a large sum of money for the Loch Ness monster , dead or alive , against the slender chance of his having to pay . At present , Lloyd 's is insuring hotelkeepers and owners of buildings in Britain and America against damage resulting from the exuberant reaction of the general public to reports , true or false , of an armistice between the United . Nations and ( a ) Germany , ( b ) Japan , or ( c ) Germany and Japan . What is Lloyd 's ? To begin with , it is not an insurance company ; Lloyd 's and the companies represent opposing camps in the insurance trade  --  although , as we shall see , they often pool their strength for major engagements . To understand Lloyd 's unique organization , one does well to recall its coffeehouse days  --  Lloyd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many caf  --  s in old London , and in its smoke-filled upstairs room , the merchants and traders of the City would meet with the skippers of the sailing ships who came up from the near-by docks for a cup of coffee and a smoke . Yarns were swapped and tall tales of typhoons , sharks and shipwrecks made the rounds . There was danger in the seven seas , and there was cash in the pockets of the London merchants , and between the two , insurance formed a tender bond . Edward Lloyd , owner of the coffeehouse , got only tuppence for a cup of coffee , but he saw his modest establishment grow into a meeting place of some importance , and it appears that he gut quite a kick out of this . He had his waiters read aloud important announcements , such as news of the safe arrival of an overdue clipper ship , and sometimes vessels were auctioned " by the candle " in his caf ? . Little else is known about Edward Lloyd , and when he died , in 1713 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there was no reason in the world why his name should have remained connected with the insurance business . But the name , miraculously , stuck ; the habitues of the coffeehouse did not part with it when they moved over , in 1774. to a suite of rented rooms in the Royal Exchange , nor in 1928 , when they set themselves up in their own building in Leadenhall Street . Today , " Lloyd 's " is probably the most prominent single name in the field of international commerce ; it is known wherever ships ply the perilous seas , wherever men are afraid of disaster . Shipping companies in many countries , having no connection whatever with Lloyd 's , London , have borrowed the name and used it as if it were a common noun : Rotterdamache Lloyd , Nordcleutscher Lloyd , Svenska Lloyd , Lloyd Triestino . It was significant  --  and more , perhaps , than just another quaint manifestation of British conservatism  --  that Lloyd 's underwriters insisted on establishing a physical semblance of the old coffeehouse even in their luxurious new marble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1877 individuals trading under the name of Lloyd 's are as loosely tied together as the visitors to a caf ? . Although they are guided by an elected committee of twelve and a chairman , they do business " each for his own part , and not one for another . " To , be sure , whenever . a large risk is placed at Lloyd 's , it is spread out among many members  --  a single policy , such as the ? 1,000,000 policy that covered the S. S. Titanic , may be signed by most of the 1877 men behind Lloyd 's , but even so , everyone is obligated only to the extent of his specific share . If you have to take your policy to court , you can sue anyone whose name appears on it  --  you can not sue Lloyd 's . This lack of a customary framework often baffles strangers ; American soldiers who sometimes visit the establishment by way of a conducted tour look puzzled when they are told that Lloyd 's is not a company , not even a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask , and the reply is an old one , ascribed to a former Caller in The Room : " Individually , we are underwriters . Collectively , we are Lloyd 's . " War is the greatest insurance risk of them all . Its purpose is destruction , and the underwriter , accustomed to staking his all on the belief that " the worst seldom happens , " has to look where he is going before he faces Mars himself with an insurance policy in his hands . In former days , Lloyd 's used to cover war risks on land and sea cheerfully , but modern war has complicated things  --  in fact , the main ' differences between World Wars No. 1 and No 2 , so far as Lloyd 's is concerned , is that the former was , by and large , an insurable risk , while the latter has been just a bit too hot to handle . Both times , needless to say , Lloyd 's came out on top . During the first World War , Lloyd 's made what underwriters in The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by covering land war risks in the British Isles . With the first German Zeppelin buzzing overhead , the British public , it seems , came rushing up to the barrier at Lloyd 's to insure their homes and belongings against wholesale destruction by aerial bombardment . Brokers were mobbed in their offices and had to hire special clerks who jotted down names and accepted premiums all day  --  a certain broker had paid ? 370,000 in excess-profits taxes before the war was over . AA everyone knows , only a few tiny and innocuous bombs were dropped , and another human fear proved unfounded , with Lloyd 's emerging as the ultimate beneficiary . Today , land war risks as such are no longer accepted at Lloyd 's , or , for that matter , by the insurance companies . Modern weapons of the air , after they had been given a trial in Shanghai , Ethiopia and Spain , drove underwriters into foxholes even before the first German pilot pulled the trigger over London in 1940 . Buildings and property are now insured by the government  --  it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill . However , at the beginning of the blitz , enterprising minds in The Room started to compute figures and tabulate losses , and before long , one group of underwriters had evolved a " 1000-to-1 " monthly insurance scheme , offering a policy covering the assured against death or loss of limbs ? " death and spare parts " in underwriters ' lingo  --  at the moderate cost of one Pound a month for ? 1000 insurance . Somewhat prophetically , the policy mentioned " aircraft missiles , projectiles , mines , explosives , gas " at a time when not I even the Germans were talking about their V weapons . This invention , dovetailing neatly with the government insurance scheme , proved a gold mine ? the group which issued the policies was able , as a gesture to the public , to double the benefits of the policy during the lull of 1942 . The arrival of the flying bomb last summer raised the amount of insurance taken out to as much as $24,000,000 in a single day , and Lloyd 's V-1 total was $120,000,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The war that rides the seas is a different proposition altogether . In Britain , just as in the United States , war-risk insurance on ships themselves is carried by the government  --  a ship that goes down is like a soldier who dies in battle , and the nation takes the loss . Likewise , at the beginning of this war , when it was evident that commercial insurance rates on sea-borne cargoes would have to be so high as to cripple Britain over seas trade , the British government took over war-risk insurance on cargo en route to and from the United Kingdom , at the same time asking commercial underwriters not to compete . On the whole , the scheme has worked out very well . Though unkind observers abroad have referred to the low government insurance rates as expert subsidies in disguise , it is more fair to say that these rates enabled Britain to carry on in the teeth of the U-boat menace , and that ; without them , our British Allies might not have been able to deliver the goods . Lloyd 's underwriters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never grumbled at being excluded from this business . Besides , there were enough " cross voyages " ? not touching United Kingdom ports  --  as well as cargoes being shipped in non-British vessels , to compensate for the loss . Marine underwriters in The Room have had plenty of opportunity to burn their fingers , especially on the hot-oil cargoes plying the Caribbean in the early days of the wider war . Almost every ton of cargo that went down off our shores and on the ticklish South Atlantic run carried , directly or indirectly , some Lloyd 's coverage , and it took an establishment that had survived the losses of eight generations to weather the storms of 1942 . This , incidentally . was one of the leanest years for Lloyd 's underwriters specializing in marine insurance  --  just as 1944 may prove to be one of the best ever . The difference between the two tells the story of the triumphant comeback of the Eagle and the Lion . The curve of Lloyd 's war-risk rates since 1939 , fixed in close co-operation with the marine-insurance companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acute pneumonia or like the barometer readings during a typhoon . Early in May , 1940 , at the first signs of the approaching storm , Lloyd 's suddenly doubled its rates for all voyages to Holland and Belgium . On May tenth , all war-risk policies on shipments to or from the Low Countries were canceled , and , a week or so later , the same was done for France . On June 19 , 1940 , the rate for shipments from the American continent to the United Kingdom went up from 5 per cent to 73 per cent of the value of cargoes insured , and on July tenth it was jumped to 10 per cent . Thereafter , with the U-boats taking a steadily increasing toll , rates skyrocketed and premiums as high as 20 to 30 per cent for perilous voyages were not exceptional  --  meaning that Lloyd 's sometimes received nearly one third of the value of a ship 's cargo if the ship got through . On August 7 , 1941 , precisely four months before Pearl Harbor , Lloyd 's sharply reacted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent on all voyages to and from the Far East . The maximum transatlantic rate charged by the British government , from Pearl Harbor to the North African landings , was 5 per cent . And , then , on November 12 , 1941 , just four weeks before America entered the war , Lloyd 's could announce the first reduction in the transatlantic rate , stating the measure reflected " the improved situation and the strong naval policy of the United States . " It was the first faint rainbow after the deluge . In June , 1943 , rates for the Mediterranean were quoted again , for the first time since the early summer of 1940 , and after the Allied landings in Normandy the transatlantic rate went down to 1t per cent  --  the sun had broken through at last . Obviously , large-scale commercial insurance is possible only in a highly capitalistic society . It requires a large pool of ready cash  --  enough to buy a new ocean liner , a new Empire State Building , a new Golden Gate Bridge . According to Lloyd 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , each underwriter liable down to the last penny of his personal fortune for the fulfillment of his policies . Anyone wishing to become a member of Lloyd 's is closely investigated and must show free assets of at least $100,000 ; besides , he has to deposit some $40,000 in cash with Lloyd 's committee , and an annual audit gives the committee a chance to find out whether he is still on the right road or courting disaster . Lloyd 's is proud of the fact that , as a result of these safety measures , no holder of a Lloyd 's policy has ever lost a cent through a member 's insolvency . Most of the 1877 members , however , never see the inside of The Room . Known as the " names , " these men merely put up capital for the professional underwriters ; they may be merchants , hankers or even Lloyd 's brokers , and all they do to implement their membership , after making their deposits , is to receive their annual checks . They belong to groups , or syndicates , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professional underwriter who may or may not he a " name " himself . " Everything , " a Lloyd 's member will tell you , " depends on the judgment and experience of the man in The Room ; he has to make snap decisions and should be equally familiar with the American oil business , the skill of osteopaths in Brazil and the political situation in Palestine . It is this necessity of being a jack-of-all-trades , as well as the constant need for improvisation , that constitutes the main difference between one of our underwriters and the underwriter for an insurance company whose business is highly specialized and whose rates are often fixed by a tariff . " Accordingly . the underwriter at Lloyd 's is paid like a movie star or a band leader or any other kind of professional genius ; as a rule , he receives a salary of $1000 a year from each of the twenty or thirty " names " whom he represents , in addition to a commission which may amount to as much as one fifth of the syndicate 's profits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while the average nonactive " name " is doing well if he receives a check for $7500 at the end of the year . What kind of people are these underwriters ? Essentially gamblers , they thrive on the unshakable conviction that everything will be all right . With them , optimism is far more than an attitude  --  it is the lifeblood of their profession . For each insurance contract represents a bet in which the underwriter stakes the combined fortunes of his " names " on his confidence and his actuarial knowledge that you John Public , are a fool to be afraid . If you lose  --  that is , if the anticipated calamity does not occur  --  all you 're out of pocket is the insurance premium you have paid ; if he loses , too bad ; his syndicate has to make good your loss . As everything is done on a personal basis at Lloyd 's , much depends on the chitchat that flies back and forth between underwriters and brokers . All gamblers under the skin , they are fond of wisecracks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A continuous emotional updraft breezes through The Room . Setbacks are taken in good humor , and if an underwriter discovers that the joke has been on him , he rarely quibbles . A word must here be said about the famous Lutine bell which hangs over the Caller 's head in the center of The Room at Lloyd 's . The bell was salvaged from the Lutine , a Lloyd's-insured frigate which went down in 1799 off the Dutch coast with some $6,000,000 worth of gold . A week after the news of the sinking had been received , Lloyd 's was able to inform the Admiralty that an equivalent amount of gold to replace that lost was ready for shipment . Much of the gold was salvaged decades later , and among the relics brought back to light from the Lutine wreck was the ship 's bell , which was placed in The Room and rung to obtain silence for important announcements , such as the arrival of an overdue ship  --  once for had news , twice for good news . So well known became the bell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its peals for a gag in a propaganda program announcing the loss of Allied shipping during the height of the U-boat campaign . In recent years . radio and wireless have almost silenced the Lutine bell . The last time it was rung  --  twice  --  was to announce the sinking of the Bismarck , in 1941 . Underwriters have a soft spot for the romance of their trade , with its hazards and surprises and treasure hunts . The Lutine case is meaningful to them , not just because Lloyd 's paid a $6,000,000 loss without batting an eye , but because it glamorizes the insurance business . All that is salvaged from the loss is the underwriter 's . In 1993 , when a plane carry , ing $200,000 worth of Lloyd's-insured jewels had crashed in the African desert near Khartoum , Lloyd 's underwriters dispatched William C. Crocker , one of the smartest lawyers of the City , to the scene of the crash . Crocker located the wreck , and , by computing the speed with which the plane had crashed and the momentum which had forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bags . he was able to put his finger on an 8-carat emerald in the sand precisely where his calculation had placed the treasure . That night , Crocker loaded a substantial part of the desert into sacks ; by washing the sand in his hotel bathroom , in Khartoum , he salvaged most of the " lost " diamonds , rubies and emeralds  --  for Lloyd 's . A case which has become almost too famous to be retold here is that of the Egypt 's gold . The Egypt had left London on May 19 , 1922 , for India with a load of gold and silver insured at Lloyd 's for $5,000,000 . The next day she was rammed in the fog by a French steamer off the coast of Brittany and sank within twenty minutes . Lloyd 's paid the loss . When the wreck was located , eight years later , it was found that she had settled at twice the depth at which divers could operate at that time  --  special gear had to be devised for the salvage operation . It was not until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succeeded in lifting the first of the Egypt 's gold ; the news caused a sensation in the City , and London papers dispatched special correspondents to Brest to flash reports of every new gold bar that was brought to light . All Britain held its breath , and cheered wildly from the side line when Lloyd 's had won its race against the stormy seas . As it happened , the price of gold had gone up considerably by then , and although the underwriters had to pay 62 ? ... i per cent of the salvage to the Italian company . a substantial part of their loss was recovered . " The Egypt 's gold " became a household word . Forty-eight hours after Pearl Harbor , Lloyd 's noted " an encouraging increase in business from the United States , both in marine and nonmarine insurance . " There could have been no more appropriate illustration of the unshakable confidence of American business in Lloyd 's , the London underwriters , than this sudden jump at the time of a great national crisis . This confidence had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the London blitz . " Our Amerleen friends kept right on sending us their orders , " a leading underwriter at Lloyd 's explained recently . " I suppose they figured there would always be a Lloyd 's . " Today , Lloyd 's  --  focal point of international insurance in war and peace  --  handles nearly as much in American orders , mostly reinsurance , as the rest of its business put together . Just how much , no one can tell . AB Lloyd 's is a loosely connected group of individual underwriters , it is under no obligation to tell the world how much it makes . Wild guesses oe to its aggregate premium income are from time to time published in the press , ranging from $150,000,000 to nearly $2,000,000,000 a year . Whatever it is , the American premium income is only slightly below one half of the total insurance sums . The largest single risk handled at Lloyd 's today is the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge , insured for approximately $40,000,000 against collapse or any other hazard . Lloyd 's underwriters share this colossal hazard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actual distribution of the risk is the result of one of the most difficult adjustments ever to be made in the insurance trade . Roughly speaking , the total sum involved was split into two layers , with Lloyd 's accepting a relatively small share of the bottom layer  --  losses resulting from partial destruction of the bridge and involving a settlement up to , say , one half of the total , and a very much larger share of the top layer  --  losses exceeding that sum . If the bridge should disappear one of these days , Lloyd 's would have to pay out an amount which would exceed even the Titanic and LUtine claims , Because Lloyd 's underwriters cooperated to this unusual extent , the American insurance companies , among themselves , accepted a larger volume of the risk than they had originally been prepared to underwrite  --  illustration of the extent to which Lloyd 's may sometimes play its part in the American insurance business . It was only fitting that Lloyd 's largest single risk should be connected with the San Francisco Bay region . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its start . In Lloyd 's spectacular rise from an obscure seventeenth-century coffeehouse to its current position , the San Francisco fire of 1906 stands out as an event of historic importance  --  it broke the ice and , figuratively speaking , warmed the American public up to Lloyd 's . On that tragic occasion , four square mile ; of valuable property burned to cinders ; the total damage , amounting to some $500 , - 000,000 , was divided among 107 insurance companies , with a share of more than $50,000,000 falling upon the British insurance market , including Lloyd 's . Lloyd 's settled San Francisco 's claims without quibbling , in the shortest possible time , More than that , Lloyd 's // ( Continued front Page 86 ) underwriters were prepared to insure the temporary buildings constructed to house the survivors . Such fair dealing paid , not unexpectedly , rich dividends , and if Lloyd 's hitherto had handled only an insignificant fraction of the American insurance business , it now emerged among the leaders . Hollywood , it seems , is more Lloyd's-conscious than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real estate is insured at Lloyd 's against earthquake , and some Hollywood parents let Lloyd 's do the worrying about would-be kidnapers of their children  --  Lloyd 's will insure you up to 90 per cent of the ransom money in the event of such money being actually paid and the insured person returned alive or dead . The movie industry , especially , ie a pet of Lloyd 's  --  or is it the other way around ? Major productions are customarily insured for $750,000 against losses resulting from death , accident or illness of certain artists , mentioned by name in the policy . If a production should be interrupted at a point where the picture is nearly completed , but can be finished off and marketed without detriment to the producer 's or actor 's reputation , Lloyd 's themselves will go into the movie business , have the picture completed at their expense and reimburse themselves out of the first box-office returns . However , Hollywood is merely a driblet in Lloyd 's great American pot o ' gold . The main sources of transatlantic premium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American railroad business , Lloyd 's underwriters complain , has become something of a white elephant of late . " Since the beginning of the war , " one of them explained , " your railroads have been worked to the bone , Exceptionally heavy traffic , especially along the Eastern seaboard , has led to a general deterioration of equipment and a higher accident rate . We 've had to raise our rates three or four times since the beginning of the war , but even so , we just about break even . " In the field of aviation insurance . on the other hand , great satisfaction prevails in The Room . American air lines have to insure their huge passenger liabilities , and a single twenty-seat passenger liner usually carries as much as $2,000,000 worth of insurance per flight . In addition , of course , the planes and engines , as well as ground installations , are insured . " Now , what is happening , " Lloyd 's men admit , " is that the safety factor of your air services keeps going up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accordingly . One might almost any Lhat the increase in safety is proceeding at a faster pace than the decrease in rates ; it has already overtaken it , " Aviation insurance is bound to be cheaper after the war , when our aviation bu.sines may reach the proportions of our marine business . " Much of the fine art of insurance consists of passing the buck . The bulk of Lloyd 's American premium income today is derived from reinsurance  --  the assured being not a private citizen , but an insurance company . Insurance companies the world over , it seems , are in the habit of biting off more than they can comfortably chew , and Lloyd 's helps out with a pair of powerful jaws . You , the public , may thus be insured at Lloyd 's without knowing it . An insurance company which has insured your building against fire , wary of having to pay your total loss if the house burns down , turns around and insures itself at Lloyd 's against having to pay you . It is customary to reinsure a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original risk , and the insurance company pays Lloyd 's a premium like everyone else . A form of reinsurance which has become particularly popular in the United States is one that travels under the ominous name of catastrophe reinsurance . Under such an arrangement , Lloyd 's underwriters promise to reimburse American insurance companies for losses caused by a single catastrophe , such as a flood or hurricane , which run beyond the totals Americana are willing to carry alone . Lloyd 's has thus helped shoulder the final bill for almost all recent American disasters . The Texas storm of July , 1943 , is still remembered in The Room with unmitigated horror ? $5,000,000 is no chicken feed . And that recent New England hurricane blew a cold wind through Leadenhall Street . Of all the standard types of insurance , only life insurance is outside the orbit of Lloyd 's today . This taboo has much to do with the temperamental side of Lloyd 's business ; statistics , the very foundation of company insurance , mean little to a Lloyd 's man  --  there is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " than in the average coffeehouse booth . Besides , a Lloyd 's policy runs for one year only , and long-term responsibilities are definitely frowned upon . " Everybody dies , " one underwriter remarked , " so what 's the fun of writing life insurance ? " However , there is a slight flaw in the standard life-insurance policy : it excludes suicide if it occurs during the first year or two of the policy . Lloyd 's obligingly steps into the breach and will insure the beneficiaries under an existing life-insurance policy if the assured person should end his own life  --  another illustration of the manner in which Lloyd 's and the insurance companies complement one another . Lloyd 's does not advertise -- the sales angle is deliberately neglected . Being something like the granddaddy of insurance , Lloyd 's is jealous of its own respectability . It resents the fact that freak insurance cases are often played up in the press , which gives the public sometimes the impression that Lloyd 's is a fancy betting institution . " As a matter of fact , " Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explains , " we do not do any betting at all . Only people with a definite insurable interest will get Lloyd 's to writo a policy . Besides , the committee imposes certain rules upon the members ; nobody . for example , can insure himself against the death of the reigning monarch , and we will not insure anybody against the end of the war  --  it would be immoral . " Al though straight bets are not accepted at Lloyd 's , Lloyd 's men themselves are notorious betting addicts . Every day , at lunch in the Captain 's Room at No. 12 or at Pimm 's around the corner , private bets are laid on the end of the war , and if a broker approaches an underwriter in The Room with an exciting proposition , the temptation to sign it is great . Thus , a week or so before every American presidential election , Lloyd 's underwriters will carry a few thousand dollars of " insurance " for their American friends  --  the amount of the premium paid represents the odds a particular underwriter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Room 's attitude toward life in general  --  an attitude of stark realism , tempered by a dash of **30;2246;TOOLONG philosophy . No one can insure himsel against poverty ; obviously , it would be a pleasure to go broke and then ask Lloyd 's to indemnify you with a crisp check . It was this rule which saved Lloyd 's from awkward repercussions of the 1929 stock-market crash . No one can insure himself against remaining a bachelor or herself against becoming a spinster . If you are married , Lloyd 's will not insure you against a divorce . The success of a Broadway play , the circulation of a newspaper , the turnover of a department store , are not insurable ; your job is n't insurable either . And Lloyd 's will not insure you against your committing murder . This , however , pretty well concludes the list  --  in most of these cases , common sense would keep you from approaching Lloyd 's anyway . Perhaps the most fascinating aspect of Lloyd 's is the fact that it has developed a definite personality . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two and a half centuries of its growth , is a strange mixture of British conservatism and is faculty for improvisation not ordinarily present in the British temperament . Indeed , a successful operator at Lloyd 's has to be something of a Creative genius , and in many a deal for which there is no precedent in the history of insurance he is guided largely by his intuition . This does not mean , however , that Lloyd 's men are amateurs ; the great Lloyd 's empire owes its spectacular success to the sober , shrewd and hard-bitting manner in which its underwriters , for generations past , have got the better of hazards whose nature was largely un- mown . The future ? Although the uncertain-ties of war may send Lloyd 's premium income to dizzy heights . Lloyd 's men are professional pacifists . Marine insurance , accounting for nearly one half of Lloyd 's over-all business , is based on interna-tional trade ; and the free flow of commerce between nations is the lifeblood of international insurance of every type . Its stake in the reinsurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in in-ternational co-operation . Before the war , for example , the largest risk handled at Lloyd 's was the vast network of chemical plants and laboratories owned by I. G. Farben in Germany ; another large source of premium income , canceled by the war , was the French merchant marine .
