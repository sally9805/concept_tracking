txt As darkness fell last night a waxing moon rose above the smoldering embers of the previous night 's great fires , which threatened for a time to destroy the beautiful St. Paul 's Cathedral and St. Mary-le-Bow Church , whose sweet-toned chimes for generations have lulled the Cockney children to sleep . The German Air Force then returned in force to London to continue the attack that has made life in this capital a nightmare since Saturday . The all clear was sounded at 4:39 this morning , after the raid had been in progress for eight hours and twenty-four minutes . Nazi bombers smashed at London with increasing violence early today , The Associated Press reported . Until early this morning , it was stated , the attack was much less ferocious than the previous three . Then the pace stepped up until four separate squadrons were wheeling about the capital at the same time at opposite points of the compass . The screams of their bombs , the earth-shaking crashes , the blazes that lit the sky , the clangor of fire engines and ambulances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engines droning like a mosquito that does not bite . brought another sleepless and nideous night to 7,000,000 harried persons who are trying to carry on in the face of an attack that spares neither humble workmen 's homes nor the homes of the nobility . Bombing Is at Random For nine hours last night explosive-laden planes roared overhead , dropping high explosive and incendiary bombs apparently whenever the spirit moved the man in charge of the bomb racks to press the button . They released death and destruction upon helpless civilians who shuddered each time the ground shook beneath them . Two hospitals , one filled with ailing children and the other a maternity hospital , suffered heavy damage . It is not accurately known at present , while the raid is still going on , how many homes were wrecked or persons killed , for the rescue workers are still digging among the ruins . It was estimated , however , that Sunday night 's raid caused at least 286 deaths and sent 1,400 persons , including the lame , halt and blind , into hospitals , seriously injured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the injured , or even the extensive proplrty damage that really counts in : his battle for London , which is a nere prelude to the Battle for 3ritain .

Slum ovels , wealthy homes , warehouses ad luxury apartments , all felt " the // LONDON IS HARRIED FOR FOURTH NIGHT // indiscriminate blast of the German bombs . The central business district was scorched , too , by hot blasts from the skies . The City of London , this capital 's East End , West End and Northern environs suffered grievously . It was a general assault and so was last night 's raid , wherein scattered German bombers turned the moonlit hours into a night of horror . Tired folk who had spent wakeful hours below ground during Monday night 's nine-hour attack , straggled wearily to work yesterday , hitchhiking , walking and traveling round-about routes . Red-eyed and worn looking they tried to resume their regular tasks . Recurrent raids made this difficult . Four times before the alarms screamed the night time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treat with respect , the sirens had sounded . Once was at lunchtime , wilich many spent below ground in shelters . The next was at teatime . The third and fourth came in rapid succession at the evening rush hour . Tired and hungry throngs were just preparing to assuage their hunger and thirst and then go home . The all clear after the fourth warning brought an outpouring from the shelters and a rush of homegoers that made most sections of London look like the section around the Yankee Stadium after a World Series game . The lines of waiting travelers still stood waiting for buses and pouring into the Underground when , a little after 8 P. M. , the fifth warning of the day announced that another night of terror had begun and that the paralyzing blight , which stills the city 's life as though it had been abandoned , was upon it . Life after dark has almost ceased , and tonight , even before whistles blew , there was little traffic moving . Most theatres have folded up and the cinemas have been urged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what has happened to their pals who defied the Blitzkrieg , are becoming steadily more eager for shelter and less eager for fares . During one of the daylight raids yesterday a Messerschmitt cannon was heard barking in the skies while machine-gun bullets rattled on the roof-tops . Whether these latter came from raiders who were gunning the populace from high up or from the defending British fighters could not be told because it was impossible to see what was happening overhead among the clouds . Last night , as every other night since the raids of horror began , the main mass of raiders was preceded by an advance guard of highflying planes loaded with incendiary rather than explosive bombs . Their job is to light the fires that guide the night raiders . Danger does not stop for London when the all clear sounds . First there are the constant interruptions of warning whistles , almost equally as disturbing as the all clear , but worst of all , in those periods when life is presumably peaceful , are the delayed-action bombs , planted the night before . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these delayed-action fuses set off explosives left behind by Monday night 's raiders . Bombs had fallen all over London . But even after the all-clear sounded , as dawn broke , there was no surcease from those dull rumbling noises . which shook this steel and concrete building as they shook almost everything else . The people of London are showing a remarkable facility in fitting themselves to the necessity of the moment . If it is necessary to sleep in their clothes underground , well , that is what they will do . From Limehouse to Mayfair last night people were carrying pillows and blankets to the shelters at their normal bedtimes . They had had enough dashing back and forth to shelters each time the siren blew , and they had decided that it was easier to spend those nine hours sleeping on the floor of a shelter than sitting there wakefully awaii. - ing an all-clear signal .

This was no holiday for which the people of this capital were prepa.ing , but a whole Winter in the new way of life that modern warfare had imposed upon them . Three big sections of London were without gas and water last night . Thousands of men and women who had struggled to work after a sleepless night straggled homeward last night on foot . Truckloads of canned food were carried into one East London area to feed those who had no means of preparing their own dinners . Urged to Save Water LONDON , Sept. 10 UP ) ? Tonight the London Metropolitan Water Board urged citizens to " use the utmost economy " until the water supply is " restored to its full quantity , " thus illustrating the damage already done to vital mains . " There must be increasing cooperation from every consumer , " the board warned . Utilities service was restricted over several London areas . The teashops contrived to go on making tea , but they sometimes rationed it , one cup to a customer . Only cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tomatoes , salads and the like . Today 's four daytime visitations were accepted as mere preliminaries , as preparations for another full night of horror . First Casualties Listed LONDON , Sept. 10 ( UP ) ? Still without figures on casualties in the attack of last night and this morning , the government revealed a toll of 592 dead and about 2,740 wounded in the London area from Saturday evening until Monday morning . An official statement said 286 persons were killed and about 1,400 seriously wounded in the Sunday night-Monday morning attack . The Saturday night attack took 306 lives and wounded about 1,340 others . Thus far , it is asserted , the mass attacks on London have not strained Britain 's aerial defense resources but merely prove that a determined armada of bombers with sufficient escort planes and a willingness to accept large losses can not be kept from reaching an objective , either by day or by night . In this connection , British officials said that in the thirty-six hours ending at dusk tonight at least fifty-eight German planes had been shot down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
