Britain is already looking forward to Part II of World War II . Part I will end when Germany is defeated . Scripps-Howard Columnist Raymond Clapper last week cabled from London : <P> " Great Britain is looking at this war in terms of a ' part one , ' to be followed by a quite different ' part two . ' . . . The British expect a considerable change of pace after Germany is defeated . . . . England , which is now the advance base in the fight against Germany , sees herself dropping out of the combat zone and fighting a war remote from her home shores , as we are doing now . . . . For instance , the huge air-raid precaution services , the Home Guard , the anti-aircraft defenses and all other activities connected with the bombing of England and the danger of invasion would have no further purpose and would be rapidly dismantled . A partial demobilization of troops is expected , and a partial conversion of war industry back to peactime work . <P> " There has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would lose interest in the war , once Germany was defeated . But when high Government officials are asked about this they stoutly deny it , saying Britain has too many interests in the Far East to take any such position . . . . "
