Plans for the escape were made on a Thursday : the grim little group of officers had agreed that Singapore could not hold . On the Sunday of Singapore 's collapse , an aide-de-camp swam out to a Chinese sampan and sculled it back to shore . Aboard went the officers , headed by Major General Henry Gordon Bennett , Commander of the Australian Imperial Forces in Malaya . After nightfall the sampan slipped out of the harbor . <P> There had been friction between General Gordon Bennett and the British High Command . The Australian 's dislike for Air Chief Marshal Sir General Robert Brooke-Popham was embarrassingly obvious . But Henry Gordon Bennett was a valuable soldier , and his supposed capture , obligingly confirmed by the Japanese , was a blow to the Allies . <P> But that Sunday night General Gordon Bennett 's sampan had bumped into a seagoing junk carrying six British officers . The General 's party switched to the larger vessel , set an uncertain course for Sumatra . The torn page of an atlas was their only chart . Dawn found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their food and water were nearly gone when an Allied launch picked them up . <P> In Batavia last week , before returning home to Australia to report for further duty , tough , brusque Henry Gordon Bennett told a story that was anything but pretty . He and his men held out " until the last moment , " were no match for " lack of water , incessant bombing and greatly superior numbers . " Two hospitals had only enough water to last another 24 hours . Bombings were so violent that of one group of 400 Australians only 14 men were left after a three-day attack . The enemy 's numerical superiority needed no amplification . No matter how often told , or by whom related , the fall of Singapore could never be anything but an unpretty story . <P> But when General Gordon Bennett flew home , only his family and a few brother officers greeted him in Sydney . In Melbourne the War Cabinet coldly awaited his report . General Gordon Bennett could - and did- sayfor himself that he had endured his men 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until after the surrender . It was still not a pretty story .
