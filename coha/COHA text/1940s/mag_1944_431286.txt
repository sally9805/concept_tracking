Let 's begin by admitting that you do n't like poetry . You respect it , of course ? you even confess you ought to like it ? but you insist you just ca n't read it . I think I know the reason , or some of the contributing causes . Moreover , I think I know how your distaste or apathy can be overcome . To begin with , poetry is deeply embedded in every nature , for literally we all began with poetry . Go back a few million years before man came to this agitated little planet . The earth , the solar system , the whole universe were set in motion with rhythmical power . The stars circled about the sun in measured time ; the moon established its regular rhythm ; the seesons were evenly quartered ; the tides rose and fell with clockwork accuracy . When man finally was evolved , he echoed those rhythms ; the tides rose and fell in the precision of his pulse ; his heart beat to measured time . To emphasize the poetic beat of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been eternally swung to the soothing of a lullaby . Rhythm and rhyme are so natural to the child that he accepts poetry as his first enjoyment . Does the child begin with prose ? On the contrary , a little child ' claps his hands to nursery rhymes , dances to jingles , learns to count by rhyme . " One , two , buckle my shoe ; three , four , open the door . " A child would be abnormal if he preferred " One , two , buckle my slipper ; three , four , close the window . " From Mother Goose we progress easily to A Child 's Garden of Verses , that delectable treasury of happy rhymes . And then one day we discover " The Owl and the Pussy-Cat " and " You Are Old , Father William , " and , a little later perhaps , " Little Boy Blue " and " Hiawatha " and even " Tiger ! Tiger ! burning bright . " We do n't know that these are poems ; we are not yet aware that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out that they were written by people named Stevenson and Lear and Lewis Carroll and Eugene Field and Longfellow and William Blake . Then the trouble begins . The classroom makes a lesson out of what was a luxury . Not at first , but as we worm our way up through high school , we begin to lose the excitement of the words that delighted us . The syllables are chopped up into arbitrary accents , into confusing feet . No longer can we dance to " Christopher Robin goes hoppity , hoppity " without being asked whether the dancing feet are iambic , trochaic , dactylic , or anapestic . We have to learn the mathematical difference between tetrameter and hexameter . We no longer read for the sheer joy of rhythm  | and rhyme ; we must know how to scan a poem . Worse , we must interpret it , or restate in our own halting terms what the poet has said perfectly . ( " Poetry , " said the schoolboy unhappily but accurately , " is something we make prose of . " ) To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research , names , dates , occupations , and other " association items . " We must memorize a poem , whether we like it or not , as an exercise or , all too often , as a punishment . No wonder the youthful love of poetry is killed , replaced by an adult suspicion , which has made poetry the stepchild of the arts . No wonder we are prejudiced against it , telling ourselves that poetry is difficult , obscure , a special language for special people . The most natural and perhaps the most powerful of man 's expressions begins to mean little to us . Yet before men learned to write , they thought in poetry . The primitive " movers and shakers " inspired the entire tribe ? not the cultivated few ? with their chants around the campfire , their prayers for rain , their war , songs and hymns of victory . HOW , then , are we to recover our joy in poetry ? First , by realizing that we have never quite lost it . In moments of stress , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing else answers our need . When we are uplifted by some great love , or racked by some conflict , or torn with sorrow , we need the word that renews and restores : the singing word . To say what we feel most deeply , we need words that , literally , say it with music . It may be a clipping torn from a newspaper , or a scrap pasted in an album , or a verse glimpsed in a magazine ; but we are struck by the thrill of discovery and recognition . Somebody else has felt what we feel ? and has said it better than we ever can hope to say it . The poets are our spokesmen in a literal sense . They have spoken for us . They give strength to our private emotions by transcending them . Everyone , even the least demanding , needs expression . The soul of the most inarticulate person does not differ from the soul of the poet . Both are affected by longing , hope , desire , despair , torture , ecstasy . By the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the poet furnishes an expression for all of us , a healing or a sublimation of our own unsatisfied emotions . But can our hearts quicken and our minds stir so that words leap from the printed page to excite or comfort us ? Yes , if we remember that we think in images , that we talk in metaphors , that we dream in poetry and poetic symbols . We live in terms of poetry ; we are moved to act through its agency . An orator utters a ringing phrase , a flag is unfurled , and our pulses pound . " Some stars , lilies , leopards , a crescent , a lion , " wrote Emerson , " an eagle , or other figure , which came into credit God knows how , an old rag of bunting , blowing in the wind , on a fort , at the ends of the earth , shall make the blood tingle ender the rudest or must conventional exterior . The people fancy they hate poetry , and they are all poets and mystics ! " " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " they are all poets , " responsive to it in everything they say . I have said everyone despises poetry in public and practises it in private . Were we as allergic to poetry as we pretend , we would walk dully through a world , unilluminated by fancy , unresponsive to the music in rhyme or the color in language . But our world is not dull . Every day has its poetry . No holiday passes without being ushered in by verse , from Valentine ditties to Christmas rhymes . How can a commonplace person appreciate the glory of poetry ? Simply by realizing that poetry is the glory of the commonplace . It is the power of making the familiar seem strange , and the strange seem familiar . Poetry lets us look at ordinary objects as though we never before had seen them . To the poet , and so to us , nothing is ignoble , cheap , or even commonplace . Blake looks at a bit of dirt and a weed and sees " a world in a grain of sand , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a heartful of tenderness when his plow upturns the nest of a field mouse . Whitman discovers miracles in the blackberry and universes in a leaf of grass . Sandburg shows us endless wonders in an old pond in a brickyard . Frost unfolds an abiding philosophy as he pictures two neighbors mending a wall . Kipling glorifies a whole catalogue of mechanical objects ? steamships , deepsea cables , bell buoys , express trains ? and turns these practical things to poetry . FORGET all you have had to " learn " about poetry . Forget the devices , the names of the intricate forms , the talk of technique . Try reading poetry casually , as naturally as you would read a short piece of prose . Sample a serious poem , a bit of light verse . A friend of mine who always disdained poetry was persuaded to place a poetry anthology on the table beside his bed . Now , he tells me , he reads a few lines every night before he goes to sleep . Without study or effort , his mind , in tune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enriched . But whether you read for enrichment or relaxation , for healing or for a moment 's happy escape , let poetry bring you its unique combination of observation and imagination . Today more than ever we need to know that beauty still exists , that under the nightmare news and daily terror , even " .. in the mud and scum of things There alway , alway something sings . " " A living poem begins with a lump in the throat , " said Robert Frost , " a homesickness or a love-sickness . It is a reaching out toward expression , an effort to find fulfillment . " And the reader of a living poem is one who , reaching out toward the creative expression of another , is recreated ; for he not only expresses but fulfills himself .  |
