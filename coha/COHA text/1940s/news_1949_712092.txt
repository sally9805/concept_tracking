txt Defendants and their lawyers at I the Commynict trial staged such a violent demonstration against Fed eral Judge Harold R. Medina yesterday that he threatened to remand City Councilman Benjamin J. Davis Jr. , one of the defendants , to jail for the rest of the triaL The judge also charged Harry Sacher of defense counsel with " deliberately contemptuous " conduct in " flagrantly and persistently disobeying " the Court 's instructions . Three defendants and two defense lawyers took part in one of the most abusive and disorderly of the almost daily attacks on the judge in the nineteen-week trial . The defense started yesterday 's attack after Judge Medina ruled irrelevant an article written in 1938 by John Gates , editor of The Daily Worker , official party organ , on the civil war in Spain . Mr. Gates is one of the eleven members of the , party 's American Politburo or national board being tried for conspiracy to teach and advocate violent overthrow of the United States Government . In the four days Mr. Gates has been on the stand as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort to meet the Government 's evidence that the defendants , on orders from Moscow in 1945 , reorganized the party on conspiratorial and totalitarian lines and taught party members how to use the 1917 Russian Bolshevik revolution as a blueprint to seize power here and perpetuate themselves in power . Defense counsel have spent most of their time trying to show that the defendants took part in various lawful activities that had nothing to do with the conspiracy charge . Judge Medina , saying he wanted to give the defendants a fair opportunity to try to show that their intent was peaceful instead of violent change , allowed them much leeway in bringing in such evidence , but set limits to avoid repe-. tition and " indefinite " delay of the trial . Therefore the judge sustained an objection by United States Attorney John F. X. to the admission of Mr. Gates ' article . Ignoring the judge 's order against arguments on rulings without the court 's permission , Richard Gladstein of defense counsel angrily insisted that defendant 's ideas on the war in Spain were relevant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the judge explained patiently . " I feel I am drawing the line in the proper place . The war in Spain is out . " If he let such material in , the judge added , it might divert attention from the real issue- : - whether the defendants are guilty of conspiracy as charged . Mr. Gladstein continued to argue in a loud voice , gesturing angrily with his arms , until the judge said quietly : " If I am wrong , the law provides the remedy , but I am doing it very definitely and decisively . " You say no evidence was allowed . What have we been doing here for the last few days ? Mr. Gates has been reading paper after paper of his own documentation showing what he thought and what he was doing and all that . " I try to be liberal ' about it , but I want to ' avoid multiplicity andconfusion of the issues . " Protests By Defendants Robert G. Thompson , the party 's New York State chairman , another defendant , then got up and made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's general secretary , who is acting as his own counsel , asked permission to address the court , which the judge granted . He asked the court to reconsider its ruling and sat down . Then Mr. Davis got up . " Before you say very much , " the judge told him mildly , " I want to make a little observation . You gentlemen have been bobbing up here , saying and doing things I do not consider very proper , This is the first time you have got up . " Now I have determined I am going to have an orderly trial . I do n't think you gentlemen in the early stages thought I meant what I said or that I would succeed . " But it appears I have succeeded rather well and the proceedings are becoming more regular and orderly every day . " I have penalties at my disposal , if the defendants insist upon interrupting the proceedings and holding forth , although they have lawyers to represent them , but I dislike doing some of the things the law places it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rerifenibee that for ycilir own good . " Mr. Davis , who is a graduate of Amherst .. College and . ; Harvard Law School and whOSe ? , ccindnct hitherto had been the most dignified of any of the defendants , then said : " It is pretty hard for the defendants to sit here like a bump on a log , as you say , while a whole lot of rulings are made which are practically cutting the guts out of what our party stands for . This court claims ? " " I consider that an extremely offensive statement , " the judge cut in . " Well , " Mr. Davis replied , " the whole trial is offensive to me and should have been thrown out a long time ago . " " No defendant gets very much pleasure out of a criminal trial , " the judge remarked . " I do n't see what pleasure the Government could get , " Mr. Davis replied , " in bringing this ridiculous and stupid trial in the first place . " " Now , Mr. Davis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you may be forcing me to remand , you during the remainder of the trial ? " " Well , I can not help that , " the defendant replied curtly . " All I want to do is say the truth . " " Oh , you can help it , " the judge said . " You can help it . " " If you wanted the truth , " Mr. Davis went on , " you would let our party say what it teaches and advocates in Spain and elsewhere . " " If you insist upon being disorderly , " the judge warned , " I shall remand you for the remainder of the trial . Let 's go on . " Mr. Davis then sat down and Harry , Sacher of defense . counsel continued questioning Mr. Gates on other matters . Mather in the day , in an- argument on other material that was ruled out of evidence , : ' the judge asked Mr. ' Sather if he realized his conduct was " deliberately- contemptuous . " The judge has made it clear'that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawyers in contempt of . court  --  during the trial  --  because this might delay proecedings while the , cited lawyers withdrew-'and were replaced by others who would need time to familiarize themselves with the case . If a defendant were remanded , his bail would be revoked , he would be taken to jail by a Federal deputy marshal at the end of every court session , and he would be brought back to court every morning . Gates ' Testimony Continues On the witness stand Mr. Gates denied Government evidence that he had taught students in party schools the use of Stalin 's " History of the Communist party in the Soviet Union ( Bolsheviks ) " as a " bible " or " blueprint " for American revolution . He insisted there was no contradiction between a statement in this " History " that Karl Marx taught socialism could not be achieved without force and violence , and a statement in the American Communist party 's constitution calling for expulsion from the party of anyone advocating force and violence . What the " History " meant , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assumed power it was necessary for it to set up a " dictatorship of the proletariat " to " crush any violent resistance on the part of the former ruling class minority trying to overthrow the ' working class government . " He said assumption of power by the " working class " could be peaceful or violent . Historically , he said , it was violent only when " the ruling class attempts to thwart the will of the majority by force and violence , " so that the " workers " used force and violence in self-defense . Mr. Gates also insisted there was no inconsistency between the Communists ' opposition to " all " dictatorship on one hand , and , on the other hand , their support of dictatorship of the proletariat . The reason for this , he said , was that the dictatorship of the proletariat ) was really " the highest form of democracy . " Throughout his testimony , Mr. Gates treated the party constitu- rtion and other party documents at face value . The Government had introduced evidence that these were written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lenin in Russia before the 1917 revolution to conceal from the public the party 's revolutionary aims under " protective windowdressing . " After listening to four days of Marxist cliches , nineteenth-century European double-talk , pseudoscientific jargon and Communist slogans , Judge Medina rubbed his eyes after one particularly involved ' piece of testimony , and saida , " If does n't make much sense , does it ?
