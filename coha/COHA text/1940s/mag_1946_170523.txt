The anti-Communist resolution passed at the C.I.O 's Atlantic City convention was mild enough . But it had given state C.I.O. councils the green light to crack down on local Reds . Within the last fortnight both Massachusetts and New Jersey had done so . Last week it was Wisconsin 's turn . <P> At a state convention in out-of-the-way Wausau , C.I.O. moderates ousted the left-wingers who had run the show since 1937 . Out went party-liner Robert Buse , leader of the bloody , 33-week Allis-Chalmers strike ( TIME , Nov. 11 ) . In a bold sweep , the right-wingers captured all top offices and 15 out of 26 seats on the state council . The new president : Milwaukee 's Herman Steffes , right-wing head of U.A.W. 's Local 75 at the Seaman Body division of Nash-Kelvinator.
