What the free world knows of the nightmarish operation of the Russian police state has been mainly divulged by people who fled the regime because they hated it . U.S.-born Anna Louise Strong , 63 , apparently still loves and admires the Soviet system , although she was roughly tossed out for " spying " ( TIME , Feb. 28 ) . The New York Herald Tribune ( with 20 other U.S. newspapers ) this week published Anna Louise 's own story of her arrest . <P> Said the Trib , in its introductory note : " It is damning because it is authentic ; and it is authentic because its author is a convinced Soviet sympathizer . . . Every present protestation by Miss Strong of her continued devotion to the Kremlin only underlines . . . the fact that friends and enemies alike are only insects under the heel of the vast , impersonal and inhuman despotism which she served . . . " <P> A Bang on the Door . In her first installment , Anna Louise related : <P> " I went to bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . A bang on the door awoke me and the loud word : ' Open ! ' ... I threw on a kimono . . . Three men in uniform strode in . ' Come with us . You are arrested . ' <P> " ' Me ? ' I cried . ' Me ? ' <P> " ' Quickly , ' they said . <P> " ' What for ? ' I gasped . <P> " ' Come at once . ' " <P> Anna grabbed her Chinese padded gown , a box of vitamin pills , three handkerchiefs , and followed her captors . " My mind raced madly . . . What , what , what had I done ? Why , everybody liked me here ! At the last diplomatic reception , Mme. Molotov had shown me a special favor . . . We turned . . . into the inner court of Lyubyanka prison . . . ' How , ' I gasped , ' shall I ever get out of here ? ' " <P> Prisoner Strong was examined by a woman doctor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which guards could watch her . A bright light glared down in her face . " All night between snatches of sleep , I faced my sins . " Why was she there ? Her best guesses : 1 ) she had annoyed somebody by trying to get to China via the " closed " Manchurian frontier ; 2 ) it was a " stupidity of some department eager to make a record . " <P> Next day , a jailer announced : " The commissar wants you . " Across a long table , Anna Louise confronted the commissar : <P> " ' What am I supposed to have done ? ' I demanded . The commissar quelled me with a glance . ' I 'm asking the questions , ' he said . . . thy name , birthplace . . . How many times in the U.S.S.R. ? Over what frontiers ? . . . Why should any American go back &; forth to the U.S.S.R. except for subversive reasons ? He had no concept of the life of a journalist . <P> <P> " I wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to write , to explain it to the world ! ' The words froze . He would n't permit them , nor would he understand them . " The commissar rose to pronounce judgment : Journalist Strong was to be expelled for spying . " I tried once more to protest that I was n't a spy ... He said , ' Dismissed , ' very curtly , and I went . . . "
