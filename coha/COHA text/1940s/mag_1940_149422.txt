THE PRESIDENCY Non-Political Campaign <P> From the crest of gigantic Chickamauga Dam , which backs up the waters of the turbulent Tennessee River eight miles above Chattanooga , President Roosevelt this week made his first major address since he accepted the Democratic nomination for the Third Term . Hatless in the withering sun , he sat in the back seat of an open car that had been run up on a hastily-built slack pine ramp . Sweat poured down the President 's face , soaked through his seersucker suit . <P> The President had said that he would make no political speeches . But he drove to the scene through the streets of Chattanooga , lined for three miles with crowds standing three and four deep on the sidewalks , with Roosevelt and Wallace placards everywhere . And he spoke in the setting where the conflicting philosophies of Wendell Willkie and Franklin Roosevelt had clashed before . <P> In his sonorous and flexible voice , his delivery easy , President Roosevelt dwelt on the meaning of TVA . " When I first passed this place . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useless , sometimes turbulent and in flood , always dark with the soil it had washed from the eroding hills . . . . There were and are those who maintain that the development of the enterprise that lies largely in this State is not a proper activity of Government . As for me , I glory in it as one of the great social and economic achievements of the United States . " <P> His local audience had grown rather too used to the idea of TVA to thrill to it again . It cheered , but the effect was not what he achieved later that day . The eleven-car Presidential special took him and his party to Newfound Gap to dedicate the Great Smoky Mountains National Park , with a speech on a sterner topic . Fascism . <P> " If the spirit of God is not in us , " said he resonantly , " and we are not prepared to give all that we have and all that we are to preserve Christian civilization in our own land , we shall go to destruction . ... I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still belong ... to the people of a free nation . . . will not be in the hands of some strange kind of government puppet subject to an overseas overlord . I hope the use of it will not be confined to people coming hither on government-specified days and on government-directed tours . . . . <P> " We know that in the process of preparing against danger we shall not abandon the great social improvements that have come to the American people in these later years . We need not swap the gain of better living for the gain of better defense . I propose to retain the one and gain the other . . . . What shall we be defending ? The good earth of this land , our homes , our families-and far more . We shall be defending a way of life which has given more freedom to the soul and body of man than has ever been realized in the world before . . .. The winds that blow through the wide sky in these mountains-the winds that sweep from Canada to Mexico , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men . We are free today . If we join together now . . . and face the common menace as a united people , we shall be free tomorrow . "
