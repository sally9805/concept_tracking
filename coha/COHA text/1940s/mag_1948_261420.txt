The body gets 20% to 40% of all its energy by burning up fat . But scientists have not known exactly how-or where-the body burns its fat-fuel . Last week a young ( 31 ) University of Chicago biochemist named Albert Lehninger reported a solution of the puzzle . His report at the American Chemical Society 's meeting in Washington ( see SCIENCE ) won him the $1,000 Paul-Lewis Laboratories Award. + <P> Scientists have known that it is enzymes which burn up fat , and that certain co-enzymes are needed to get the fire started . But the identity of the co-enzymes was unknown . Biochemist Lehninger discovered that the same enzymes which oxidize carbohydrates also oxidize fat . He found out where the burning takes place , too . In the cells of the liver ( where half the body 's fat is oxidized ) are small , granular structures called mitochondria . The mitochondria , Lehninger announced , are the cellular power plants " or stokers or burners " for the combustion of fat . <P> The discovery may lead to a better understanding of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normally : jaundice , hardening of the arteries , a liver disease called infectious hepatitis . There is also tentative evidence that cancer cells use fat abnormally . <P> <P> + Awarded annually to the scientist under 35 who has done the best research in enzymes .
