Charles Linza McNary , 66 , Senator from Oregon for 23 years , is no fire-eater . A soft-spoken legislative expert , he never makes a speech if he can help it , has long been a mystery to effervescent New Dealers , who call him able , shrewd , liberal , weary , lazy , cynical . When he was given the Republican nomination for Vice President they predicted that he would show no enthusiasm in his campaign , if he campaigned at all . They said that since he had voted for TYA , Bonneville Dam , had steadily fought the Hull reciprocal trade agreements , he and Wendell Willkie were on opposite sides of the fence and could never get along . <P> At Salem , Ore . last week , Charlie McNary formally accepted the Republican nomination in a speech ( the first of eight scheduled for the campaign ) that was neither weary nor cynical . <P> Sweat , Blood , Loneliness . Senator McNary warmed up his 12,000 listening Oregonians with a salute to the Oregon Trail . In a country where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheel marks of wagon trails still show near Emigrant Springs Park , that is as necessary as a tribute to Robert E. Lee once was in the South . But the Senator , who still farms land that he worked on as a boy , called it the iron road , the name given it by the people who followed it - " from the Great Bend of the Missouri to the banks of the Willamette , following the valleys of the Kaw , the Platte , the Sweetwater , the Snake and the lordly Columbia ; fording streams . . . suffering hunger , thirst and sickness aggravated by strange diets and exposure - and leaving thousands of un marked graves beside the trail . " Their trek , said McNary , was no Gov ernment project . " Land , if you had to work it , never was free . Men paid for it in sweat and blood and loneliness , if not in dollars . " Their pioneering achievements were possible because " Americans had not then been instructed that they must look to Washington for inspiration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What we can not forgive is that the New Deal , finding itself unable to restore national vitality , fashioned its plan upon the thesis that America is finished , that . . . we must look increasingly to the Government for jobs , for security , and for the oversight of our private lives . " <P> Nominee McNary 's specifications for the reconstruction of the U. S. : <P> Agriculture . Soil-conservation payments , commodity-surplus loans , encouragement of farm purchase by tenants , the food-stamp program , " some such " formula as the two-price system in the twice-vetoed McNary-Haugen Bill . " The platform offers no magic formula . The problem is far too complex . ... It does constitute a promise that the Republican Party genuinely seeks solutions . " <P> Conservation . Regulation of the annual rate of lumbering , expansion of forest reserves , reduction of forest taxation ( since a high tax rate encourages wasteful cutting ) , assumption by the Government of half the cost of abating loss from fire , insects and disease .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
