txt The largest Navy Department appropriation bill ever offered in the country 's history , carrying a total of $29,463,687,198 for the fiscal year beginning July 1 , was reported to the House today by the Appropriations Committee . The next largest was last year 's appropriation measure of $23,738,000,000 . It includes appropriations of $27,463 , - 687,198 and contract authorizations of $2,000,000,000 . The committee noted that while it made minor adjustments in the Budget Bureau 's recommendations , " in no single instance has a reduction been made in funds for ships , airplanes , guns , ammunition or other types of war implementation , or in service personnel numbers either for the Navy , the Marine Corps or the Coast Guard . " " No other safe course can be pursued , " the report added . " The Navy 's job ahead is tremendous and it must be provided with every essential to make its accomplishment less difficult and absolutely sure and decisive . " The committee 's report quoted testimony by Vice Admiral F. J. Home , Vice Chief of Naval Operations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fleet " and indicating that the battleship has been reduced to an inferior position . " Paradoxical as it may seem , " he is quoted as telling the committee in executive session , " the fleet as such no longer exists , that is , as an operational unit . Missions in modern naval warfare are generally accomplished by task forces . I think that the naval battle as such , battleship against battleship , big fleet against big fleet , is out of the picture for the future . " The ideal task force is one built around the aircraft carrier and since the carrier is relatively inferior in armament it is necessary that some one run interference for her . The cruiser is the ideal type for this from the standpoint of flexibility , speed and armament " The committee 's report said that it was " highly elated over the optimism " voiced in testimony of Admiral Ernest J. King , Commander in Chief of the Fleet and Chief of Naval Operations , and of Secretary Knox . The report noted that the bill provides funds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " The airplane production objective , Army and Navy , for which provision heretofore has been made , has been 185,000 airplanes by the end of the calendar year 1943 . Present indications are that there will be six months ' delay in the complete realization of that program , but even so it is a wonderful tribute to American industry and to responsible Army and Navy leadership . " Whether the peak of Navy appropriations has been reached was " purely conjectural , " the report said , adding : " Present indications do not point to much contraction , if any , prior to the fiscal year of 1946 . " Highlights of other testimony in executive sessions follow : The Navy has grown from 907 vessels of all kinds in 1941 to 3,183 this year , and by July 1 , 1944 , it will have about 5,100 ships . Six battleships of 35,000 tons or more are in service and two more are nearly ready . Contracts for 27,642 naval planes will be let in fiscal year 1944 . These include 100 four-engined transports of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Martinbuilt Mars type of flying boat . The Navy 's greatest need is escort vessels for combating submarines because the latter are being built faster than they can be destroyed . The Navy 's personnel will total 2,500,000 enlisted men and 225,000 officers by July 1 , 1944 , including 13,000 Wave officers and 50,000 enlisted Waves .

The Marine Corps will total 285,000 enlisted men and 21,661 officers , plus a women 's reserve of 500 officers and 6,000 enlisted personnel . Cost of training naval aviators is put at $27,000 each . A plane in the air costs $29 per hour ashore and $33 off a carrier at sea . Rear Admiral W. H. P. Blandy , Chief of Navy Ordnance , denied that an attempt has been made to pass off inferior steel on the Navy . There has been " no difficulty whatever , " he said , with the CarnegieIllinois Steel Corporation , which the Senate Truman Committee reported was producing naval steel below specifications .
