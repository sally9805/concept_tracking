He was n't exactly handsome ; he was more like a heavy-duty freight train . A wise horse , he exerted himself no more than necessary . He never bothered to break a record unless it took record time to win ; he was content to win his races by a neck , or a nose . But even a great gelding like Armed , smart in pacing himself , can run down . Five months ago , after winning eleven races and $288,725 in one season , he was pulled off the track and given a rest . <P> His handlers gave him a soft diet of bran mash and hay , and nothing to do all day . Then gradually he was brought up to form with long jogs and short workouts . A fortnight ago , at Florida 's Hialeah Park , the Big Train raced again . He won-by a few inches . Last week , with 130 Ibs. on his back , + the brown gelding did it again . Neither race was an important one , but they were impressive warm-ups for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Hialeah next week and the $100,000 Santa Anita Handicap the following week . Armed 's toughest competitors , Assault and Stymie , are both taking the winter off . <P> If all goes well in Florida 's Widener , Armed 's Millionaire Owner Warren Wright plans to fly the big horse out to California for the Santa Anita race , his first airplane ride . At six , Armed still seemed to have a lot of run left in him-and he was already the sixth biggest money-winner ( $391 , - 575 ) in racing history . <P> <P> + Including 106-lb . Jockey Doug Dodson and a pound and a half of saddle . The rest was lead , in serted in a pad under the saddle , since the track handicapper had given Armed the maximum weight to carry . The added weight slows a horse down , gives lighter-weight lesser lights a chance .
