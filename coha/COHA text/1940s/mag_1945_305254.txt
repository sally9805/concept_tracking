The owner of the Boston Red Sox , big-game-hunting Tom Yawkey , looked up last week at the stuffed head of a bull moose which hangs on his office wall and mused : he might be " playing center field for us before the season is over . . . . <P> But with three weeks of balmy northern training weather under their sliding pads , few big-league clubs were in Yawkey 's state of mind . Fewer irreplaceables had been lost to the services than anyone dared hope last winter . For managers as well as fans , hits and fast balls had cut clean through the gloom , even if there was a little less talent in some spots . <P> In the American League , the St. Louis Browns had to be figured as favorites again-at 8-to-5 with the bookmakers . Their one weak spot , Manager Luke Sewell hoped , would be plugged by Pete Gray ( up from Memphis ) , the most talked-about rookie of the year . Pete , a one-armed outfielding wonder who can hit some and drag bunt to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Browns were stronger than they were a year ago . But at least two clubs seemed certain to give the Browns a real argument : <P> Detroit 's Tigers , still cocky because of their potent pitching pair-Dizzy Trout and Hal Newhouser , who racked up a record of 56 wins last year-still can not pretend it is n't painful to have lost Slugger Dick Wakefield ( .355 ) and Pink ) Higgins ( .297 ) . <P> New York 's Yankees , with Larry MacPhail now calling the front office shots , are praying twice a day that the Navy wo n't call up clouting Johnny Lindell . The Yanks still have the best manager in baseball : square-jawed Joe McCarthy . <P> All the rest are manpower-hungry and struggling to shake off a second division complex . Yawkey 's Red Sox have Batsmen Bob ( .324 ) Johnson and Ervin ( .315 ) Fox , little else . The loss of Third-Sacker Ken Keltner leaves Cleveland with but one top-drawer infielder , Shortstop-Manager Lou Boudreau . Dynamic Jimmy Dykes , Chicago White Sox manager , has high hopes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shoes of Hal Trosky . Weak behind the plate , strong on Cubans again . Washington is minus its only .300 hitter , Stan Spence . Philadelphia 's Athletics hoped ex-Milwaukee Outfielder Harold Peck would give their hot- &-cold; batting order new heat . <P> In the National League , the St. Louis Cardinals ( quoted at odds-on 4-to-5 ) should keep their class if they can keep 1-A Catcher Walker Cooper . Manager Billy Southworth , who must replace Stan Musial ( the league 's No. 2 hitter last year with a .347 average ) , Johnny Hopp ( .336 ) and Danny Litwhiler ( .264 ) , still has the best pitching staff ( Mort Cooper , Max Lanier , Ted Wilks , Harry Brecheen , Blix Donnelly ) in either league , and Shortstop Marty ( " Most Valuable Player " ) Marion . Apparently capable of giving the three-time league champs a run for their money are two western rivals : <P> Chicago 's Cubs again lean heavily on the strong pitching arm of Claude Passeau and the big bat of home-run specialist Bill ( " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have practically the same well-balanced club that finished a far-off second to the Cardinals last season , may find it hard going without the managerial magic of Frankie Frisch , who is sicker with inflammatory arthritis than most people think .
