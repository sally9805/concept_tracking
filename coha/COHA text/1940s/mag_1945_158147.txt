From Moscow last week came a description of Warsaw , as seen by a recent visitor to the Praga ( east ) side of the Vistula , where the Red Army 's advance halted more than three months ago : <P> " Warsaw has a deathly stillness . In the whole panorama from Poniatowski Bridge to Kierbedz Bridge ( both wrecked ) there was not a single sign of human life . The buildings are not all flattened-some walls stand , but they are shells . The Prudential Insurance skyscraper ( twelve stories ) had lost its tower and one could look right through holes from one side of the building to the other . Only one church could be seen standing : the Wizytek on Cracow Street . There was not a trace of St. Alexander Church in the Square of the Three Crosses , or of the famous Holy Cross Church . <P> " North of Kierbedz Bridge there appears to be nothing left at all . There was no vestige of the Royal Palace - just empty space where it was . The Old City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suburb , is entirely destroyed . <P> " Warsaw is dead , and yet it seems that the rubble must be captured some time . Even the ruins seem to be waiting for something . " <P> Last week neither the Russians nor the Germans said anything about some thing happening or about to happen on the Warsaw-Vistula front . The Germans alone told of something happening in the Latvian pocket above Riga . Berlin said the Red Army had " sacrificed tens of thousands of men " to gain one penetration .
