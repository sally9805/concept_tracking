An ultimate in program popularity testing was promised last week by CBS . If its new radar-like spy system lives up to its pressagentry , program directors will be all but able to read listeners ' minds . <P> Instantaneous Audience Measurement Service was invented by Dr. Peter C.

's listening posts will be little black gadget boxes attached to the family radio in " scientifically selected " homes . These boxes , responding to signals from station transmitters , will flash radio messages back at the rate of one a minute . At the station , these thousands of messages will be electronically counted and translated into graphs showing a program 's minute-to-minute popularity . <P> CBS 's gadget is not so new as it sounds ; the U.S. Patent Office has similar inventions on file , dating back to 1931 .
