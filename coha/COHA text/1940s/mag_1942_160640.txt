To a nation which was shaking off its isolationism and turning its eyes toward the outer world , yet could see only dimly the path to the future , Wendell Willkie last week made a pregnant speech : <P> " It will be a new idea to many Americans that the United States may in the future need help from other nations . But we do need help if our ideas of personal liberty , of justice , of equality , of hope and growth and expansion , are to survive . We can keep America to ourselves , though I doubt if the America we keep to ourselves would be free . But we can not keep freedom to ourselves . If we are to have freedom , we must share freedom . . . . <P> " On Bataan the Filipinos and Americans , fighting side by side , learned the real meaning of equality . We know now , in a way that we could never have known before , the real equality between races . We know , too , that in that idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope , of the future . <P> " The day is gone when men and women , of whatever color or creed , can consider themselves the superiors of other creeds or colors . <P> " The day of vast empire is past . The day of equal peoples is at hand . <P> " Let us keep that aim shining before us like a light-a light for the people of Europe , for the people of Africa , for the people of Asia , for the people of South America and for the people of our own beloved land . " <P> Seldom before had any U.S. leader said , in such clean , earthy words , that the freedom on which his nation was founded meant freedom and dignity for all people of all lands .
