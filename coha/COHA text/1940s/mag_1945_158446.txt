In Denver , Rabbi Samuel Rose , 89 , received word that his son , Major General Maurice Rose , had been killed while surrendering to the Germans on March 30 ( TIME , April 9 ) . Rabbi Rose sat down heavily , grasped his cane , spoke from a Scripture-filled heart : <P> " It is well that since this had to be , it happened in the week of Passover . As Jehovah said , ' When I see the blood , I will pass over you . ' He spoke not only to the Jews but to all peoples , to the Gentiles , to Americans , to Germans , to all peoples . . . . And so , may Jehovah accept this sacrifice , and see the blood and pass over all peoples for their sins , at this Passover time , for my son 's sake . "
