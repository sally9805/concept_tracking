FOR ME , as for many others , the reading of detective stories is an addiction like tobacco or alcohol . The symptoms of this are : Firstly , the intensity of the craving ? if I have any work to do , I must be careful not to get hold of a detective story for , once I begin one , I can not work or sleep till I have finished it . Secondly , its specificity ? the story must conform to certain formulas ( I find it very difficult , for example , to read one that is not set in rural England ) . And , thirdly , its immediacy . I forget the story as soon as I have finished it , and have no wish to read it again . If , as sometimes happens , I start reading one and find after a few pages that I have read it before , I can not go on . Such reactions convince me that , in my case at least , detective stories have nothing to do with works of art . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the detective story , i.e. , of the kind of detective story I enjoy , may throw light , not only on its magical function , but also , by contrast , on the function of art . Definition THE vulgar definition , " a Whodunit , " is correct . The basic formula is this : a murder occurs ; many are sus-petted ; all but one suspect , who is the murderer , are eliminated ; the murderer is arrested or dies . This definition excludes : ( 1 ) studies of murderers whose guilt is known , e.g. , Malice Aforethought . There are borderline cases in which the murderer is known and there are no false suspects , but the proof is lacking , e.g. , many of the stories of Freeman Wills Crofts . Most of these are permissible . ( 2 ) thrillers , spy stories , stories of master crooks , etc. , when the identification of the criminal is subordinate to the defeat of his criminal designs . The interest in the thriller is the ethical and eristic conflict between good and evil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study of a murderer is the observation , by the innocent many , of the sufferings of the guilty one . The interest in the detective story is the dialectic of innocence and guilt . As in the Aristotelian description of tragedy , there is Concealment ( the innocent seem guilty and the guilty seem innocent ) and Manifestation ( the real guilt is brought to consciousness ) . There is also peripeteia , in this case not a reversal of fortune but a double reversal from apparent guilt to innocence and from apparent innocence to guilt . The formula may be diagrammed as follows . Peaceful state before False innocence murder Revelation of presence Murder of guilt False clues , secondary False location murder , etc. of guilt Solution Location of real guilt Arrest of murderer Catharsis Peaceful state after True innocence arrest In Greek tragedy the audience knows the truth ; the actors do not , but discover or bring to pass the inevitable . In modern , e.g. , Elizabethan , tragedy the audience knows neither less nor more than the most knowing of the actors . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all ; one of the actors ? the murderer ? does ; and the detective , of his own free will , discovers and reveals what the murderer , of his own free will , tries to conceal . Greek tragedy and the detective story have one characteristic in common , in which they both differ from modern tragedy , namely , the characters are not changed in or by their actions : in Greek tragedy because their actions are fated , in the detective story because the decisive event , the murder , has already occurred . Time and space therefore are simply the when and where of revealing either what has to happen or what has actually happened . In consequence , the detective story probably should , and usually does , obey the classical unities , whereas modern tragedy in which the characters develop with time can only do so by a technical tour de force ; and the thriller , like the picaresque novel , even demands frequent changes of time and place . Why Murder ? T HERE are three classes of crime : ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighbors ; ( b ) offenses against God and society ; ( c ) offenses against God . ( All crimes , of course , are offenses against oneself . ) Murder is a member and the only member of Class B. The character common to all crimes in Class . A is that it is possible , at least theoretically , either that restitution can be made to the injured party ( e.g. , stolen goods can be returned ) , or that the injured party can forgive the criminal ( e.g. , in the case of rape ) . Consequently , society as a whole is only indirectly involved ; directly , its representatives ( the police , etc. ) act in the interests of the injured party . Murder is unique in that it abolishes the party it injures , so that society has to take the place of the victim and on his behalf demand restitution or grant forgiveness ; it is the one crime in which society has a direct interest . Many detective stories begin with a death that appears to be suicide and is later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belonging to Class C in which neither the criminal 's neighbors nor society has any interest , direct or indirect . As long as a death is believed to be suicide , even private curiosity is improper ; as soon as it is proved to be murder , public inquiry becomes a duty . T HE detective story has five elements the milieu , the victim , the murderer , the suspects , the detectives . The Milieu ( Human ) The detective story requires : ( 1 ) A closed society so that the possibility of an outside murderer ( and hence of the society being totally innocent ) is excluded ; and a closely related society so that all its members are potentially suspect ( cf. the thriller , which requires an open society in which any stranger may be a friend or enemy in disguise ) . Such conditions are met by : ( a ) the group of blood relatives ( the Christmas dinner in the country house ) ; ( b ) the closely knit geographical group ( the old world village ) ; ( c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( d ) the group isolated by the neutral place ( the Pullman car ) . In this last type the **25;323;TOOLONG formula applies not only to the murder but also to the relations between the members of the group who first appear to be strangers to each other , but are later found to be related . ( 2 ) It must appear to be an innocent society in a state of grace , i.e. , a society where there is no need of the law , no con-. tradiction between the aesthetic individual and the ethical universal , and where murder , therefore , is the unheard-of act which precipitates a crisis ( for it reveals that some member has fallen and is no longer in a state of grace ) . The law becomes a reality and for a time all must live in its shadow , till the fallen one is identified . With his arrest , innocence is restored , and the law retires forever . The characters in a detective story should , therefore , be eccentric ( aesthetically interesting individuals ) and good ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in appearance , later shown to be false , or in reality , first concealed by an appearance of bad . It is a sound instinct that has made so many detective-story writers choose a college as a setting . The ruling passion of the ideal professor is the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake so that he is related to other human beings only indirectly through their common relation to the truth ; and those passions , like lust and avarice and envy , which relate individuals directly and may lead to murder are , in his case , ideally excluded . If a murder occurs in a college , therefore , it is a sign that some colleague is not only a bad man but also a bad professor . Further , as the basic premise of academic life is that truth is universal and to be shared with all , the gnosis of a concrete crime and the gnosis of abstract ideas nicely parallel and parody each other . ( The even more ideal contradiction of a murder in a monastery is excluded by the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might well not confess his crime , the suspects who are innocent of murder but guilty of lesser sins can not be supposed to conceal them without making the monastery absurd . Incidentally , is it an accident that the detective story has flourished most in predominantly Protestant countries ? ) The detective story writer is also wise to choose a society with an elaborate ritual and to describe this in detail . A ritual is a sign of harmony between the aesthetic and the ethical in which body and mind , individual will and generallaws , are not in conflict . The murderer uses his knowledge of the ritual to commit the crime and can be caught only by someone who acquires an equal or superior familiarity with it . The Milieu ( Natural ) I N THE detective story , as in its mirror image , the Quest for the Grail , maps ( the ritual of space ) and timetables ( the ritual of time ) are desirable . Nature should reflect its human inhabitants , i.e. , it should be the Great Good Place ; for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murder . The country is preferable to the town , a well-to-do neighborhood ( but not too well-to-do ? or there will be a suspicion of ill-gotten gains ) better than a slum . The corpse must shock not only because it is a corpse but also because , even for a corpse , it is shockingly out of place , as when a dog makes a mess on a drawing room carpet . Mr. Raymond Chandler has written that he intends to take the body out of the vicarage garden and give murder back to those who are good at it . If he wishes to write detective stories , i.e. , stories where the reader 's principal interest is to learn who did it , he could not be more mistaken ; for in a society of professional criminals , the only possible motives for desiring to identify the murderer are blackmail or revenge , which both apply to individuals , not to the group as a whole , and can equally well inspire murder . Actually , whatever he may say , I think Mr. Chandler is interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a criminal milieu , the Great Wrong Place , and his powerful but extremely depressing books should be read and judged , not as escape literature , but as works of art . The Victim THE victim has to try to satisfy two contradictory requirements . He has to involve everyone in suspicion , which requires that he be a bad character ; and he has to make everyone feel guilty , which requires that he be a good character . He can not be a criminal because he could then be dealt with by the law and murder would be unnecessary . ( Blackmail is the only exception . ) The more general the temptation to murder he arouses , the better ; e.g. , the desire for freedom is a better motive than money alone or sex alone . On the whole , the best victim is the negative Father or Mother Image . If there is more than one murder , the subsequent victims should be more innocent than the initial victim , i.e. , the murderer should start with a real grievance and , as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to murder against his will where he has no grievance but his own guilt . The Murderer M URDER is negative creation , and every murderer is therefore the rebel who claims the right to be omnipotent . His pathos is his refusal to suffer . The problem for the writer is to conceal his demonic pride from the other characters and from the reader , since , if a person has this pride , it tends to appear in everything he says and does . To surprise the reader when the identity of the murderer is revealed , yet at the same time to convince him that everything he has previously been told about the murderer is consistent with his being a murderer , is the test of a good detective story . As to the murderer 's end , of the three alternatives ? execution , suicide , and madness ? the first is preferable ; for if he commits suicide he refuses to repent , and if he goes mad he can not repent , but if he does not repent society can not forgive . Execution , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by which the murderer is forgiven by society . ( A suggestion for Mr. Chandler : Among a group of efficient professional killers who murder for strictly professional reasons , there is one to whom , like Leopold and Loeb , murder is an acte gratuite . Presently murders begin to occur which have not been commissioned . The group is morally outraged and bewildered ; it has to call in the police to detect the amateur murderer and rescue the professionals from a mutual suspicion which threatens to disrupt their organization and to injure their capacity to murder . ) The Suspects T HE detective-story society is a society consisting of apparently innocent individuals , i.e. , their aesthetic interest as individuals does not conflict with their ethical obligations to the universal . The murder is the act of disruption by which innocence is lost , and the individual and the law become opposed to each other . In the case of the murderer this opposition is completely real ( till he is arrested and consents to be punished ) ; in thee case of the suspects it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exist , there must be some element of reality ; e.g. , it is unsatisfactory if the suspicion is caused by chance or the murderer 's malice alone . The suspects must be guilty of something , because , now that the aesthetic and the ethical are in opposition , if they are completely , innocent ( obedient to the ethical ) they lose their aesthetic interest and the reader will ignore them . For suspects , the principal causes of guilt are : ( 1 ) the wish or even the intention to murder ; ( 2 ) crimes of Class A or vices of Class C ( e.g. , illicit amours ) which the suspect is afraid or ashamed to reveal ( see Why Murder ? ) ; ( 3 ) a hubris of intellect which tries to solve the crime itself and despises the official police ( assertion of the supremacy of the aesthetic over the ethical ) . If great enough , this hubris leads to its subject getting murdered ; ( 4 ) a hubris of innocence which refuses to co-operate with the investigation ; ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which leads its subject to hide or confuse clues . The Detective C OMPLETELY satisfactory detectives are extremely rare . indeed , I only know of three : Sherlock Holmes ( Conan Doyle ) , Inspector French ( Freeman Wills Crofts ) , and Father Brown ( Chesterton ) . The job of the detective is to restore the state of grace in which the aesthetic and the ethical are as one . Since the murderer who caused their disjunction is the aesthetically defiant individual , his opponent , the detective , must be either the official representative of the ethical or the exceptional individual who is himself in a state of grace . If he is the former , he is a professional ; if he is the latter , he is an amateur . In either case , the detective must be the total stranger who can not possibly be involved in the crime ; this excludes the local police and should , I think , exclude the detective who is a friend of one of the suspects . The professional detective has the advantage that , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ethical , he does not need a motive for investigating the crime ; but for the same reason he has the disadvantage of being unable to overlook the minor ethical violations of the suspects , and therefore it is harder for him to gain their confidence . Most amateur detectives , on the other hand , are failures either because they are priggish supermen , like Lord Peter Wimsey and Philo Vance , who have no motive for being detectives except caprice , or because , like the detectives of the hard-boiled school , they are motivated by avarice or ambition and might just as well be murderers . The amateur detective genius may have weaknesses to give him aesthetic interest , but they must not be of a kind which outrage ethics . The most satisfactory weaknesses are the solitary oral vices of eating and drinking or childish boasting . In his sexual life , the detective must be either celibate or happily married . Between the amateur detective and the professional policeman stands the criminal lawyer whose teles is , not to discover who is guilty , but to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that human law is ethically imperfect , i.e. , not an absolute manifestation of the universal and divine , and subject to chance aesthetic limitations , e.g. , the intelligence or stupidity of individual policemen and juries ( in consequence of which an innocent man may sometimes be judged guilty ) . To correct this imperfection , the decision is arrived at through an aesthetic combat , i.e. , the intellectual gifts of the defense versus those of the prosecution , just as in earlier days doubtful cases weresolved by physical combat between the accused and the accuser . The lawyer-detective ( e.g. , Joshua Clunk ) is never quite satisfactory , therefore , because his interest in the truth or in all the innocent is subordinate to his interest in his client , whom he can not desert , even if he should really be the guilty party , without ceasing to be a lawyer . Sherlock Holmes H OLMES is the exceptional individual who is in a state of grace because he is a genius in whom scientific curiosity is raised to the status of a heroic passion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( e.g. , his ignorance of the Copernican system ) ; he is in all matters outside his field as helpless as a child ( e.g. , his untidiness ) , and he pays the price for his scientific detachment ( his neglect of feeling ) by being the victim of melancholia which attacks him whenever he is unoccupied with a case ( e.g. , his violin playing and cocaine taking ) . His motive for being a detective is , positively , a love of the neutral truth ( he has no interest in the feelings of the guilty or the innocent ) , and , negatively , a need to escape from his own feelings of melancholy . His attitude toward people and his technique of observation and deduction are those of the chemist or physicist . If he chooses human beings rather than inanimate matter as his material , it is because investigating the inanimate is unheroically easy since it can not tell lies , which human beings can and do , so that in dealing with them , observation must be twice as sharp and logic twice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the natural ones for a Scotland Yard inspector . ( The old Oxonian Inspector is insufferable . ) His motive is love of duty . Holmes detects for his own sake and shows the maximum indifference to all feelings except a negative fear of his own . French detects for the sake of the innocent members of society , and is indifferent only to his own feelings and those of the murderer . ( He would much rather stay at home with his wife . ) He is exceptional only in his exceptional love of duty which makes him take exceptional pains ; he does only what all could do as well if they had the same patient industry ( his checking of alibis for tiny flaws which careless hurry had missed ) . He outwits the murderer , partly because the latter is not quite so painstaking as he , and partly because the murderer must act alone , while he has the help of all the innocent people in the world who are doing their duty ( e.g. , the postmen , railway clerks , milkmen , etc. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Father Brown ix : Holmes , an amateur ; yet , like French , not an individual genius . His activities as a detective are an incidental part of his activities as a priest who cares for souls . His prime motive is compassion , of which the guilty are in greater need than the innocent , and he investigates murders , not for his own sake , nor even for the sake of the innocent , but for the sake of the murderer who can save his soul if he will confess and repent . He solves his cases , not by approaching them objectively like a scientist or a policeman , but by subjectively imagining himself to be the murderer , a process which is good not only for the murderer but for Father Brown himself because , as he says , " it gives a man his remorse beforehand . " Holmes and French can only help the murderer as teachers , i.e. , they can teach him that murder will out and does not pay . More they can not do since neither is tempted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well trained in the habit of virtue . Father Brown can go further and help the murderer as an example , i.e. , as a man who is also tempted to murder , but is able by faith to resist temptation . The Reader T HE most curious fact about the detective story is that it makes its greatest appeal precisely to those classes of people who are most immune to otherforms of daydream literature . The typical detective story addict is a doctor or clergyman or scientist or artist , i.e. , a fairly successful professional man with intellectual interests and well-read in his own field , who could never stomach the Saturday Evening Post or True Confessions or movie magazines or comics . If I ask myself why I can not enjoy stories about strong silent men and lovely girls who make love in a beautiful landscape and come into millions of dollars , I can not answer that I have no phantasies of being handsome and loved and rich , because of course I have ( though my life is , perhaps , sufficiently fortunate to make me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , I can only say that I am too conscious of the absurdity and evil of such wishes to enjoy seeing them reflected in print . I can , to some degree , resist yielding to these or similar desires which tempt me , but I can not prevent myself from having them to resist ; and it is the fact that I have them which makes me feel guilty , so that instead of dreaming about indulging my desires , I dream about the removal of the guilt which I feel at their existence . This I still do , and must do , because guilt is a subjective feeling where any further step is only a reduplication ? feeling guilty about my guilt . I suspect that the typical reader of detective stories is , like myself , a person who suffers from a sense of sin . From the point of view of ethics , desires and acts are good or bad , and I must choose the good and reject the bad , but the I which makes this choice is ethically neutral ; it only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sense of sin means to feel guilty at there being an ethical choice to make , a guilt which , however " good " I may become , remains unchanged . As St. Paul says : " Except I had known the law , I had not known sin . " I T Is sometimes said that detective stories are read by respectable law-abiding citizens in order to gratify in phantasy the violent or murderous wishes they dare not , or are ashamed to , translate into action . This may be true for the reader of thrillers ( which I rarely enjoy ) , but it is quite false for the reader of detective stories , On the contrary , the magical satisfaction the latter provide ( which makes them escape literature not works of art ) is the illusion of being dissociated from the murderer . The magic formula is an innocence which is discovered to contain guilt ; then a suspicion of being the guilty one ; and finally a real innocence from which the guilty other has been expelled , a cure effected , not by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a genius from outside who removes guilt by giving knowledge of guilt . ( The detective story subscribes , in fact , to the Socratic daydream : " Sin is ignorance . " ) If one thinks of a work of art which deals with murder , Crime and Punishment for example , its effect on the reader is to compel an identification with the murderer which he would prefer not to recognize . The identification of phantasy is always an attempt to avoid one 's own suffering : the identification of art is a compelled sharing in the suffering of another . Kafka 's The Trial is another instructive example of the difference between a work of art and the detective story . In the latter it is certain that a crime has been committed and , temporarily , uncertain towhom the guilt should be attached ; as soon as this is known , the innocence of everyone else is certain . ( Should it turn out that after all no crime has been committed , then all would be innocent . ) In The Trial , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the crime that is uncertain ; the aim of the hero 's investigation is , not to prove his innocence ( which would be impossible for he knows he is guilty ) , but to discover what , if anything , he has done to make himself guilty . K , the hero , is , in fact , a portrait of the kind of person who reads detective stories for escape . THE phantasy , then , which the detective story addict indulges is the phantasy of being restored to the Garden of Eden , to a state of innocence , where he may know love as love and not as the law . The driving force behind this daydream is the feeling of guilt , the cause of which is unknown to the dreamer . The phantasy of escape is the same , whether one explains the guilt in Christian , Freudian , or any other terms . One 's way of trying to face the reality , on the other hand , will , of course , depend very much on one 's creed .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
