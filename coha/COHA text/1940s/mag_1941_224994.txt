This is the first bed little Pamela Hollingworth had slept in for eight nights . Picnicking with her family in the woods near Mt . Chocorua , N.H. , five-year-old Pam , dressed only in light overalls and sneakers , wandered off , got lost . For eight days her father , aided by CCC boys , State police , soldiers from Fort Devens , bloodhounds , airplanes , searched for her . It rained . At night there was frost . Late one afternoon , a searcher heard a weak little voice call " Hi , hi . " There was Pam , sitting on the bank of a brook , a couple of miles from the spot where she had last been seen . Said she : " I have been lost since Sunday and I have drunk from the brook and everything . " <P> Her father carried her back in his arms . Pam did not cry , but she was worried about having lost her blue hair ribbons . She had eaten nothing . At night she had crawled into a hole and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut off her swollen , frostbitten feet . She had lost about eight pounds . But she had survived . The reason she had was that she never got frightened , never exhausted herself , acted as sensibly as a human being could . The New York Daily News dubbed her " Little Miss Courage . "
