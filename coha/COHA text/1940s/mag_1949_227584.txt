When Salvador Dali 's ballet , Mad Tristan , opened in Manhattan in 1944 , it provided one critic with " a 25-minute yawn . " Most other balletgoers yawned , too , if not so long-windedly , and Mad Tristan flopped . Last week , the Grand Ballet de Monte Carlo had given it five performances in London . This time the madness proved catching . <P> Shouts of " Stop it ! " and " Rubbish ! " were raised in the audience . Blurted a visiting conductor : " I think this is a public scandal . " <P> A few critics liked it ; one thought Mad Tristan " beautifully presented . " But the Times spoke for the majority : " Regurgitation is a hygienic , not an artistic , process . Salvador Dali , turning aside from surrealistic painting to drama , has swallowed Wagner 's Tristan and Isolde and spewed it up with much of the murky contents of his unconscious adhering to the gobbets . " <P> The ballet opens in a " forest of idylls , " with Tristan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love symbol : a pair of giant legs topped by a hairy mask . In Scene 2 , on " the Isles of Death , " Tristan first dances with an insectlike apparition , then with something dressed as a sailing ship . In the end , Tristan is destroyed by his love , as in " the tragic nuptial rites of the praying mantis , in which the female devours the male . " <P> For customers who still did not get the pitch , the program notes explained : " Dali sees the whole romantic philosophy of Wagner as an uninterrupted complex of impotence . An exasperating procession of wheelbarrows , heavy with the earth of reality , struggling up toward the inaccessible heaven of the ecstasy of love , at the summit of which there is only a precipice-love in death and death in love . . . " Only the New Statesman and Nation had the wit to smile at such Daliance and say the sanest thing heard in the hubbub : " How odd that people should have taken Mad Tristan ... so seriously ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Music Festival , where Negro Dancer Katherine Dunham &; company last week presented her torrid Caribbean Rhapsody . The Dutch had never seen anything quite like her . Dancer Dunham did not wear a pearl in her navel ( as she did in Tropical Revue ) , but some of the audience were nevertheless overcome by all the pelvic commotion , hesitated in bewilderment before applauding . Most of the audience , however , got the idea : they were seeing precise dancing and brilliant choreography . The Dutch critics were two-minded about her . Wrote one : " Mostly it is sheer vitality , but sometimes sheer corn . "
