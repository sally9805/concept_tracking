On the stage of a raffish Broadway movie house in Manhattan last week , the antics of a 13-piece orchestra made audiences fidget and giggle . The band was going through all the motions : the swart , longish-haired leader led away ; the brasses , the saxophones , the clarinets made a great show of fingering and blowing , but the only sound from the stage was a rhythmic swish-swish from the trap-drummer , a froggy slap-slap from the bull-fiddler , a soft plunk-plunk from the pianist . This , explained Leader Raymond Scott , was silent music . <P> His explanation fell on almost deaf ears . This " silent " music was not altogether silent , and it was just provocative enough to make listeners wonder whether the silence of other bands might sound better than Scott 's . But the stunt showed that Mr. Scott still had his bid in as the most elfin of U. S. bandsters . <P> Raymond Scott-brother of Hit Parader Mark Warnow-began his career with a " Quintet " which contained six players , wrote brittle , sophisticated jazz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hungry Cannibals . In the past year Leader Scott has had a dance band , has toured up &; down the land , is proud that he knows how to pronounce names like Manitowoc , Wis . His tour has also taught him how to drive an automobile blind : to take one look at a parking space , back into it without taking another ; to memorize a turn the first time , drive it shut-eyed thereafter . Raymond Scott still drives his band open-eyed-with results which , when audible , sound neat and crisp . <P> The Chicago Symphony romped through a piano concerto by Rudolph Ganz , Chicago musician . Its scherzo had themes whose notes correspond to numbers on Composer Ganz 's 1940 and 1941 license tags.
