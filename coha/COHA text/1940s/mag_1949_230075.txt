<P> Saturday afternoon , with dusk coming on , Panama 's mild-mannered President Daniel Chanis screwed up his courage to summon Colonel Jos ' ( " Chichi " ) Remn , chief of national police , for a painful interview . The press had been pounding hard with charges of police grafting in the control of slaughterhouse and bus-line operations . After the latest blast in the Panama American , Chanis had made his decision : Remn must go . <P> Just how ailing , uncertain President Chanis expected to bring the trick off was something of a mystery . Remn , the strong man and orderkeeper for every Panama administration since 1946 , was in effect chief of staff of the nation 's only armed force , the highly trained 2,000-man police corps . He and a staff of fanatically loyal aides had absolute control of the modern police headquarters , a combination fortress , arsenal , barracks , radio communications center and model jail ( known locally as the Hotel Remn ) . By contrast , the only force directly at the President 's disposal was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Possibly Chanis felt lucky : he had already prepared to celebrate his 58th birthday at the palace on Sunday . Possibly he counted on the fact that Remn , too , has been seriously ill with liver trouble in recent months . For a little while it seemed that his plan might go off without a hitch . Remn arrived at the palace , and was confronted with a demand for his resignation along with that of his two chief subordinates . The chubby , softspoken chief refused , was placed under arrest . <P> Chanis then appointed a board of four men , headed by the Minister of Government and Justice , and sent them to police headquarters to take command . While they were on the way the President telephoned Lieut . Colonel Bolivar Vallarino , Remn 's second-in-command and ordered him to surrender his authority . Vallarino listened glumly , mumbled a request to speak with Remn , then hung up abruptly and set to work . As matters later turned out , that was the precise moment when Chanis ' hopeful plan began to fly apart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where they were hospitably received-and conducted to cells in the Crcel Modelo . Busloads of armed troopers promptly rolled out of the barracks and surrounded the palace . <P> " Rebellion ! " cried Chanis . " I will retain the presidency until I am killed . " Vallarino sat tight . In some confusion the President asked Remn to reason with his stubborn lieutenant . Chichi Remn indignantly refused to negotiate while under arrest , so he was set free . Vallarino rushed a patrol car for his boss , then Remn took command and moved fast . Police squads were deployed around Panama City , the newspapers were temporarily shut down , the telephone exchange was taken over and ordered to complete calls only to or from police headquarters . Then Chichi Remn sent his ultimatum to Chanis : unless the President resigned by 2 a.m . Sunday , police troops would attack the palace .
