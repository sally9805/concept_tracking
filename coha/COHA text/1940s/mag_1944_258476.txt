In Ed Massey 's barbershop at 3306 Main Street , Kansas City , a big , muscular man , generously daubed with powder and witch hazel , eased himself out of a barber 's chair . He had just had a haircut , shave , shampoo , scalp massage and shoe shine- " the works . " Time was when the big man , a steamfitter by trade , would have thought it mad folly to come to Ed Massey 's for anything but a haircut . But last week his pay envelope held $140 , and he now frankly enjoyed these little male luxuries-everything except a manicure . <P> He handed Ed a $20 bill , got $17.50 in change , gave Ed a 25 tip , and doled out 15 to the shoeshine boy . The Star , with its short , old-fashioned headlines , was on the cashier 's counter . The big man picked up the paper and read aloud : RED SPEED STUNS NAZIS , YANKS STRIKE IN FRANCE . <P> " Well , boys , " the big man said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would n't be surprised to see those Heinies fold up tomorrow . " <P> " Yep , " said the man in the second chair , " I got a $10 bet that this little show will be over by Labor Day . " <P> The laundryman , who had just come in with clean towels , joined in : " If that boy of mine is n't home for Christmas dinner , I 'll do a double somersault right over this chair . " <P> This seemed to settle the matter ; there was no argument . The big man went next door to Ben Brooks 's saloon , for a short one before heading home . <P> In varying forms , this scene was repeated all over the U.S. last week , in other barbershops , in factories , on farms , in the very best clubs ; on street corners and in homes , accompanied always by the radio , whose doom-voiced newscasters now had only an endless procession of good news to read . For the U.S. people , rightly or wrongly , but reading what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the war in Europe is but a matter of months . They knew it was tough ; they were not lying down on their jobs ; their own sons were " out there " fighting , and perhaps dying , but as Americans they figured it this way . <P> The signs were not only in the headlines . <P> This factory here , or that machine shop there , cut down on war production . Whole communities sniffed the new optimism . Despite the best-intentioned Old Testament preachments from Washington , the people reasoned that this would be the last summer for at least the European war . <P> Shelves Full . In some ways it seemed almost like a prewar summer . Talk of rationing and shortages dropped to a whisper : after two and a half years of war , the hardest things to get were kleenex , Camel cigarets , and shirts from the laundry . <P> Of the 14 novels on the New York Times 's best-seller list , only two had a war setting ; of the 16 nonfiction titles , only four concerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novelty for children , Swingin ' on a Star ; the three runners-up were sentimental lyrics , of which two ( I 'll Be Seeing You and I 'll Get By ) were years old . Manhattan , the very citadel of the new , reinforced the trend to the old and romantic : one night 21,000 people , the biggest crowd in two years , crammed Lewisohn Stadium to hear Oscar Levant play George Gershwin 's 1924 smash , the Rhapsody in Blue .
