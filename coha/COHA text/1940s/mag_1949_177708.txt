To find Lucia Ladanca 's name in TIME 'S May 30 issue , you had to read most of the way through a seven-column Foreign News story on Italy . At that point the story said : " The most disturbing economic fact of Premier Alcide de Gasperi 's Italy is the almost hopeless poverty of such people as hunchbacked Lucia Ladanca , a Potenza housewife who lives with her tuberculous husband and eight-year-old son Bruno in a fetid tenement not far from well-stocked stores . " <P> The story went on to say that the Ladancas never had enough money to buy Bruno trousers and shoes at the same time so that he could go to school , where he would at least get one good meal each day . " So he 's growing up ignorant , " Mrs. Ladanca said . " What 's worse , he 's hungry . " <P> Some of you were moved by this incident to write us for Mrs. Ladanca 's address , which our bureau in Rome supplied . Others wanted Bruno 's measurements so they could send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jones , of our Rome bureau , visited Lucia Ladanca , and his cabled account , which follows , may serve as one illustration of the effect of American aid to Europeans : <P> " Potenza is a sunbaked community in southern Italy on a hilltop overlooking the Basento valley near the instep of the Italian boot . During the war , the U.S. Army had a rest center there for its troops . Today few foreigners enter this desolate , impoverished region whose capital is Potenza . <P> " Lucia Ladanca lives in a semi-basement room at No. 3 Via Fratelli Bandieri , a narrow , cobblestoned street swarming with seminaked children . She had first told her story to Correspondent William Rospigliosi of our bureau last spring . When I arrived , she had just received two letters from TIME readers . One , from Mrs. Betty Jane Davidson , of Bluefield , West Virginia , said that a food package was on its way and asked for shoe and clothing sizes for everybody in the family . The other , from Bernice Sherman , of Bolton Landing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lucia does not read or write any language at all , so she went around the corner to a small household supply store owned by brawny Luigi Ottavia , who was born in the States . He read the letters to her and wrote her replies . ' Within the morning , ' he told me , ' everybody had heard about it . ' They called on her one by one , looked at the letters , which they could not read , and talked about them . Some thought nothing would happen . Others , like Luigi Ottavia , who knew something of Americans , reassured Lucia that ' something will come of this . ' <P> " At the time I was there , Lucia , who is a very devout woman , did not know what to think about this strange event that was connected with a ' giornalaio ' somewhere in America . Her husband , who could not afford medicine or hospital care , had not heard from the pensions investigator who had finally arrived to look into his case . Bruno was as bare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting by with a cotton singlet . All of them shared a diet which Lucia described as ' a little pasta , a little greens . '
