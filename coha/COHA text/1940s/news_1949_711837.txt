txt Attorney General Tom C. Clark advised the Senate Labor and Welfare Committee today that even in the absence of specific injunctive relief in the Administration 's labor relations bill the President would have authority to seek an injunction in emergencies affecting national health and . safety . Mr .. Clark 's opinion was ' read at a night ' session of the committee by its chairman , Senator Elbert D. Thomas , who threw it into the midst of a heated debate between Secretary of Labor Maurice J. Tobin and Senator Robert A. Taft , Republican , of Ohio , on the issues of the closed shop , emergencies and injunctions . Its reading stirred up a hornet 's nest in the committee . Senator Forrest C. Donnell , Republican , of Missouri , and Senator Wayne L. Morse , Republican , of Oregon , tried ' to discuss the opinion , but Chairman Thomas tried to squelch them . Clark Challenged by Taft Senator Taft challenged the Attorney General 's view . It was after a long dispute tonight , in which several Democratic Senators went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senator Taft , . that Chairman Thomas drew the . Clark memorandum from his pocket . While the memorandum bore also on other sections of the Administration bill , Senator Thomas confined his public reading to a section covering the power of the President to deal with industrial.emergencies . That excerpt was as follows : . " However , with regard to the question of the power of the Government under Title 3 , I might point out that the inherent power of the President to deal with emergencies that affect the health , safety and welfare of the entire nation is exceedingly great . ( Lewis case of 1947 . ) " Title 3 of the bill addresses it // self affirmatively to solving the underlying labor dispute , and not merely to the sterile maintenance of the status quo through the medium of the courts . " Since these sections of the bill primarily consist of a procedure for resolving the substantive matters in dispute it may be expected that in most instances differences will be settled quickly and that no recourse to the courts will be necessary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mandate of Section 302 ( E ) of the bill and should this result in a national crisis it is my belief that , in appropriate circumstances , the United States would have access to the courts to protect the national health , safety and welfare . " I say this because it is my belief that access to its courts is always available to the United States , in the absence of a specific statutory bar depriving the Government of the right to seek the aid of the Federal courts in such critical situations . " Particularly is this true where as in the proposed legislation a statutory obligation is placed upon the parties requiring them to continue or resume operations during a specific period . This bill , as I read it , does not purport to circumscribe the rights of the . United States in this respect . " The Lewis case referred to by the Attorney General raised the question of the right of the Government to enjoin the mine workers from striking after the Government had seized the mines . The Supreme Court upheld a decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the antiinjunction sections of the NorrisLa Guardia Act . The squelching of Senators Donnell and Morse was attempted by Chairman Tl-omas on the ground that all of the thirteen members of the committee had not seen the opinion . Donnell Hits at Chairman Senator Donnell declared that the chairman had made public the memorandum by reading part of it to the committee and had also given it to the press . Senator Morse heatedly chimed in with a protest that Chairman Thomas would not be permitted to transgress the rights of any member of the committee by stopping discussion of the section of the document already made public . Chairman Thomas retorted that the Republican Senators could call his actions unfair " till doomsday , " but that his only desire was to protect the Clark memorandum until all committee members had perused it . Senator Donnell , insisting that he would take up the Clark opinion tomorrow , ended the verbal altercation as the clock struck 10 , the adjournament hour , by saying that he knew of no power to seek an injunction which the President had by virtue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussion of the Clark opinion , asserted : " I disagree with the Attorney General and think he is certainly wrong . I do n't know of any inherent right of the President to get injunctions in a national emergency . If you want to do that you ought to say so in so many words . You ought to say it in clear law . " Senator Taft , in the series of earlier clashes at the hearing , demanded why Mr. Tobin had testified Monday that the Taft-Hartley Law had interfered with free collective bargaining and had emphasized individual bargaining . Flushed and angry , Mr. Taft charged that there was no basis for the statement . He insisted that the essence of the Taft-Hartley Law , of which he was co-sponsor , was collective , not individual , bargaining . " You have taken away from collective groups the traditional rights they had , " asserted the Secretary of Labor . " I deny that completely , " shot back Senator Taft . " What traditional rights have been taken away ? " " Econornie secondary boycotts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrangle over the Di Giorgio farm strike in California . In that case , Mr. Tobin asserted , while the farm workers were not protected by the eTaftHartley law , teamsters Who sought to aid the farm strikers had been promptly enjoined under it . Senator Taft replied with the case of the teamsters ' union in Cincinnati which , he said , had refused to handle " hot lumber " turned out by a union affiliated with the Congress of Industrial Organizations in Oregon . He called this a secondary boycott which should be prevented by law , but 1Mr . Tobin said he would like to I know more of the facts . The secretary insisted that 90 per cent of the harm done by the 1Taft-Hartley Act in arresting union growth was traceable to the ' ban on secondary boycotts . " If 90 per cent of the harm is done by this one section why repeal the rest of the act ? " asked Mr. Taft . Mr. Tobin said that union members had a right to protect themselves by refusing to work on jobs that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweat shops . Taft 's Father Is Cited Senator Claude Pepper , Democrat , of Florida , interjected that Senator Taft 's father , . when Chief Justice of the Supreme Court , had written a liberal ruling on the secondary boycott . " Father was liberal in his views on labor but he held the secondary boycott to be illegal , " commented Mr. Taft acidly . " Besides , " he added , turning to Mr. Tobin , " that sweat shop stuff . Is n't that just talk ? We have a 40 cents minimum wage and are soon going to 75 cents an hour , I hope . " " You should look at the bids being received by the Government , " responded Mr. Tobin . " But the Government contracts are up to you under the WalshHealey Act , " retorted Senator Taft . Mr. Tobin criticized the testimony yesterday by Cyrus S. Ching , Director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service , who opposed changing the independent status of that agency and turning it back to the Labor Department . It was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employes in conciliation disputes , Mr. Tobin declared . He called such a charge a " myth . " This morning there was a halfhour heated argument among committee members over night sessions which the majority had agreed to hold . Democratic members charged that the Republicans were trying to stage a " filibuster " to prolong the hearings . Senator Taft and Senator Donnell said that the first thing they knew about the decision to hold night sessions was when they read of it in the morning papers . A Donnell motion to suspend night hearings was defeated , 5 to 4 , on a party vote . Before calling Mr. Tobin the committee heard Paul M. Herzog , chairman of the National Labor Relations Board . Mr. Herzog testified that under the Administration bill an injunctive procedure could be taken by his board only after final hearing whereas the present law permits earlier action . Senator Taft asked why employes should not be required to bargain . Mr. Herzog felt that this requirement was " surplusage , " since unions are formed to bargain . Mr. Herzog favored having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
