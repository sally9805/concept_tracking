STEEPLE BUSH ( 62 pp. ) - Robert Frost - Henry Holt ( $2.50 ) . <P> <P> Robert Lee Frost is the dean of living U.S. poets by virtue of both age and achievement . At 72 , the four-time Pulitzer Prizewinner has lost little of his craftsmanship and none of his crackling vigor . But what was once only granitic Yankee individualism in his work has hardened into bitter and often uninspired Tory social commentary . The 43 poems of Steeple Bush do nothing to enlarge his greatness and no one of them could begin to displace the best of his Collected Poems . But devoted Frost readers will recognize an old familiar voice in such occasional , uncluttered lyrics as Bravado : <P> Have I not walked without an upward <P> look <P> Of caution under stars that very well <P> Might not have missed me when they <P> shot and fell ? <P> It was a risk I had to take-and took . <P> <P> For the rest , they will prefer to remember the younger Frost , who wrote : <P> <P> Whose woods these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the village though ; He will not see me stopping here To watch his woods fill up with snow . <P> My little horse must think it queer To stop without a farmhouse near Between the woods and frozen lake The darkest evening of the year . <P> He gives his harness bells a shake To ask if there is some mistake . The only other sound 's the sweep Of easy wind and downy flake . <P> The woods are lovely , dark and deep . But I have promises to keep , And miles to go before I sleep , And miles to go before I sleep .
