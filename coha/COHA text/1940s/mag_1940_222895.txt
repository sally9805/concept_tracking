Admiral Richard Evelyn Byrd 's giant-wheeled , 55-ft. " snow cruiser , " which is expected to straddle crevasses and galumph over the vast white fields of the Antarctic , ran into a peck of trouble in the crowded purlieus of civilization ( TIME , Nov. 6 ) . Last week the North Star was anchored in the Bay of Whales , Little America 's port of entry , and the snow cruiser was in sight of the broad antarctic plains . But its troubles were not yet over . <P> Dr. Thomas Charles Poulter , its designer and driver , was easing the monster down a wooden ramp to the ice . Suddenly the heavy planks crackled , splintered , flew in all directions like straws in a whirlwind . In the vibrant words of the radio message which reached the Navy Department : " Dr. Poulter , faced with almost certain disaster , did the only thing possible and , without hesitating , he applied full power . Throbbing and roaring , the cruiser swayed downward , leaving a wake of splintered debris behind . Expedition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ice , cheered ecstatically . Admiral Byrd , who insisted on sharing the risk of the unloading , warmly congratulated Dr. Poulter . . . . " <P> Once safely away from the ruins of the treacherous ramp , Dr. Poulter kept the cruiser going for a mile over the ice before he stopped .
