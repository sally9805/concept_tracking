txt Looking for long-time customers for engineering services , machinery and industrial supplies ? The Government of India invites your attention . The dominion 's ambitious plans for industrialization are emerging from the blueprint stage . Contracts are being signed . They involve technical surveys , chemical equipment , 543 million of locomotives , and lots of steel And these are only the beginning steps in India 's dreams of a modernized. industrial economy . But one big question will have to be answered before the dreams are translated into reality : Where is the money coming from to finance the new nation 's transformation ? The Indian government , only 14 months old , of course , has no credit rating . It has some persistent problems : Inflation , and a trade balance that 's unfavorable . But Premier Pandit Nehru 's regime has weathered mass migrations , border clashes and a minor war . Compared with some European nations , India 's trade position is relatively good . Her buyers offer U S businessmen a tempting come-on . " We are your long-time customers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished reconstruction , they 'll be out of the market for steel and machinery and farm equipment . We 'll still be buying . " The government of Iran announced yesterday it had concluded an agreement with a group of 11 U. S. engineering and industrial firms to guide a 5650-5700 million industrial and agricultural development program in that country . Funds to finance the projected seven-year scheme would come partly from the Iranian government and partly from the World Bank . See story on page 16 . American businessmen . looking into the Indian market for industrial equipment and technical services , soon find it necessary to deal with the government of India . or the states and cities under its control . Its policies hardly encourage private persons , domestic or foreign , to invest directly in major industries , Last June . the Ministry of of Industry and Supply made itself responsible " for the establishment of new undertakings " in coal , iron and steel , aircraft manufacture , shipbuilding , communications and petroleum . Private companies already engaged in these industries were given assurance for 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in event of war : their status is to be reviewed at the end of that period . Advance plans to expand Tata. major Indian steel company . naturally have been abandoned . The Nehru regime also prea .. nes that the national government should control . though not necessarily own . the following industries : Salt , automobiles and tractors. all heavy machinery , electric engineering , machine tools , heavy chemicals , fertilizers and drugs , non-ferrous metals . rubber , alcohol , cotton and woolen textiles . cement , sugar , paper and newsprint , air and sea transport , minerals and " industries related to defense . " The Indian government has served notice that it intends to expand its own operations in these fields progressively . Excessive private profits are to be taxed away . Foreign investments are to be encouraged " but carefully regulated , " with Indians to own the majority control in all but exceptional companies . Doing Business With India A. R. Palit. chief of the Indian Supply Mission with headquarters in Washington , lists sonic of the companies already doing business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engineering firm , built a fertilizer plant at Travancore . It 's in operation now , Mr. Palit reports , and is expected to produce about 50,000 tons of ammonium sulphate annually . Chemical Construction Corp . also of New York , has a contract to build a 350,000-ton-ayear fertilizer plant at Bihar . The Indians hope to have it going by 1950 . To get expert advice on setting up one to four new steel mills , India signed contracts recently with three companies : Arthur G. Co. , Koppers Co. , and an English outfit , International Engineering Co . India 's Steel Panel , set up to help plan industrial development . wants facilities capable of turning out a million tons of steel a year and so designed that total capacity can be doubled by adding to the same plants . The three engineering companies will help prepare such plans and aid in deciding on locations for the mills . Koppers has another contract to make a survey for a plant designed to extract a xmll*on tons of synthetic petroleum products annually from India 's ample low-grade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development are nothing short of stupendous . They 're outlined in a book two and a half inches thick . Eight major water power projects are planned , calculated to cost about 52 billion , providing world prices do n't go any higher . Mr. Palit believes some of the dams involved are comparable with Russia 's Dnieper dam and the U. S. Shasta dam in California . The Indian supply chief is a lively , enthusiastic man , who gives the impression of liking to get things done in a hurry . But he stresses the long-range time element in India 's plans . If she were to raise the standard of living of her 350 million people to one-tenth of the U. S. ' level , the former British possession would need 18 million tons of steel a year , Mr. Palit estimates . A steel industry able to turn out 18 million tons annually will be long a-building . Private plants in India have a rated capacity between 1.250,000 and 1,500 , - 000 tons but are producing less today because of wartime disrepair and transport bottlenecks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full tilt , India will have only 2.5 million tons , and even If the government plants are doubled ultimately , she will produce only about 3.5 million tons . Meanwhile . India would like 500.000 tons a year of steel plate and shapes from the U. S. , plus 200.000 tons of rail . Most of this material would be used for plant expansion . India-built freight cars , repairing and doubling present railroad track . The Commerce Department here grants only enough export licenses to give India about 100.000 tons of all types of steel per year , and Indiana say it 's easier to place orders for freight cars than for the steel to build them . They 've bought 350 cars from Canada and may be in the market for more . Contingent on War Of course . these plans for mills , power plants and railroads would have to be slowed , if not halted . If the U. S. and western Europe get into a shooting war . Most of the 100,000 tons of steel a year now going to India would be diverted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get better rather than worse , by the time ground is broken for the new steel mills . The engineering companies are expected to turn in their surveys next spring , but deliveries of heavy equipment and structural steel probably wo n't be needed for a couple of years . India 's oil supply is equally precarious . Her domestic wells fill about 7% of her needs . Mr Palit estimates . The rest must come from Malaya . the East Indies . Persia and ArabiaNot too much faith can be put in these ! cuprite. because of uncertain internal politics and Soviet threats . A big synthetic oil plant would help . but P- would n't fill the demand . an long as India pushes her plans for better highway and air transportation and lots of mechanical farm equipment . Where does India expect to get the money for her steel and fertilizer plants , railroads. power projects and the like ? She hopes to meet about 607 of the requirements of these big undertakings by using domestic lanor and materials . To the extent that these can be put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have to worry about raising dollars to pay for imports . Thus , a $300 million chemical plant would involve only about $120 million of spending outside India . India 's Reserve Bank . which the government proposes to nationalize , had $264 million in gold and $3,333 million in foreign exchange as recently as August . according to reports to the International Monetary Fund-India 's balance with U. S. banks , last reported in April . was $42 million . Her gold production is about $6 million a year . Included in India 's credits are a lot of British pounds , accumulated during the war in return for supplies made available to the United Kingdom These are being released slowly and enable India to make sizable purchases in England and other sterling area countries . Unfavorable Trade Balance Over-all , her foreign trade is a liability , for exports are not enough to pay for imports . Last year . India had an unfavorable balance to the tune  --  of 451 million rupees - about $122 million . But her trade with the U. S is in much better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven months of this year , India 's sales to the U. S. fell only about $5 million short of paying for her purchases , which totaled nearly $175 million . The dominion currently has a favorable balance of trade with Canada ? which more than Defects her deficit in U. S. trade . The chief U S exports to the new nation are machinery and vehicles , chemicals , wheat . unmanufactured tobacco . cotton manufactures . petroleum products . and iron and steel mill products . In return . the U S takes jute. tea , hides and skins . mica. manganese , carpet wool , raw cotton , cashew nuts , pepper and ilmenite . India has tapped the Monetary Fund for $44.120,000 in U S. dollars to meet temporary shortages . She 's eligible to draw another $55,860.000. and she 's sounding out the International Bank on the prospects for a loan to cover farm and railway equipment . The Indians feel they 're entitled to a share in the International Bank 's loans , because they are its fifth largest contributor . Their subscription , totaling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $8 million in gold . $72 million in rupees , and $320 million in the firm of an I.O.U . to he made good if the Bank ever runs into trouble . Mr. Palit and his aides insist they would he happier to get their credit from private investors in the U. S. But they doubt that India will be regarded as a good risk for the average bond market customer until her government has had at least five years to demonstrate its ability and stability . With all this development in progress and in prospect , the Indian government is n't overlooking the need for trained people to run its new plants . It 's in the market for scientific instruments for its schools and is currently asking U. S. manufacturers to submit catalogs .
