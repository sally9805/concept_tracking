When the crack New York-Buffalo Lackawanna Limited cracked up one night a fortnight ago in upper New York State , available reporters were as scarce as hen 's teeth . How the United Press got the story of the wreck , in which 28 died in live steam , made a yarn for pressroom spinning . Seldom had improvised telephone coverage , which newspapers and news associations constantly use , turned out so successfully . <P> Hero of the story was Hudson Randall , a 16-year-old , 200-lb. six-footer who plays tackle on the high-school football team at Dansville , N.Y . and in his spare time picks up pocket money working as stock boy in a Murphy 5 &; 10 . <P> About 7 p.m . Hudson Randall was in Milligan 's drug store on Dansville 's Main Street , talking about the wreck over a malted , when the phone rang . Druggist E. T. Milligan answered . The man on the other end of the line was Pete Ellis , night rewrite man for the United Press in New York . <P> U.P . Night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have the story of the wreck , which was at Wayland , seven miles from Dansville . But his nearest staff correspondent was in Rochester , 45 miles away , and could not be immediately reached . Was there anyone who was reasonably intelligent in the store at the moment ? Was there anyone there who wanted a job ? Who , When , Where , What . Druggist Milligan summoned Hudson Randall to the phone . Rewriteman Ellis gave his instructions-try to find out what caused the wreck ; try to learn exactly how many people were killed , and how many injured ; get their names and addresses and be sure to get the spelling straight ; and call back every half hour or so . Hudson said sure , and off he went , in a flivver commandeered from a chum . <P> The only other newsman at Wayland when Hudson arrived was the editor of the Wayland weekly Register . Hudson talked first with a Wayland station employe , got an estimate of the casualties , plus a graphic , first-person eyewitness description of what had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ details . <P> Next he went to the Allen Funeral Home in Wayland , got names and addresses of victims from a list compiled from steam-soaked ration books . He called New York again . <P> At other funeral homes , the Wayland Hospital and Wayland 's Masonic Temple ( where some injured were being treated ) , he got more names . Survivors gave him their versions of the accident . Then , when A. H. McLaughlin , the railroad 's chief dispatcher , arrived from Buffalo , Hudson was an unnoticed bystander while the preliminary investigation of the wreck 's cause got underway . <P> By the time U.P . ' s own correspondent arrived from Rochester , hours later , and other professional newsmen began coming in , Hudson Randall had his story pretty well by the tail , had put U.P . ahead of A.P . on some names of victims , some wreck details . <P> Said Editor Vaughan : " He did a good job and was very accurate . " Said Hudson : " It was fun . But I 'd rather be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
