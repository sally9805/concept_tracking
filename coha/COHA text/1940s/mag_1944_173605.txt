Modest Congressman <P> Sirs : <P> I appreciate very much your compliment ( TIME , Feb. 7 ) , but I am neither 1 ) handsome , nor 2 ) 29 . I am 1 ) unhandsome , and 2 ) 35- ... <P> GENE WORLEY House of Representatives Washington , B.C. <P> &gt; TIME admits that Congressman Worley should know his own age , is not so sure he knows his own face. - ED . <P> Bad Neighbors <P> Sirs : <P> ... In Texas . . , Mexicans do not ride in the so-called Jim Crow cars TIME , Feb. 7 ; they do not use the so-called Jim Crow toilets ; they go to the same schools as all other Texans except Negroes . . . and Mexicans eat wherever they wish . True , one restaurant in one town did at one time put up a sign stating that Mexicans would not be served . Can you , or anyone else , hold that one is the total number of restaurants in the State of Texas ? . . . <P> A. MORTON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every one of the 254 counties in Texas and I have yet to observe any manifestation of conditions such as reported in your article . <P> Texas very definitely does not have " Jim Crow " law as applicable to Mexicans , and what segregation there is in the schools is for the reason of difference of language rather than for any feeling of superiority . There are different social strata among the Mexicans even as among the Texans , which the Texans , with all their recognition of the economic necessity of the various strata , recognize . But as to their lumping all Mexicans together in " extreme intolerable racial discrimination , " that is a pure figment of imagination . <P> I am surprised that TIME , with its zeal for factual . description , should have been so bamboozled . <P> J. D. MOFFATT <P> Little Rock , Ark . <P> Sirs : <P> . . . The Mexican race , in general , is very unclean , untidy and unsanitary as far as personal health and living conditions are concerned . They seldom bathe , seldom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their dogs , cats , chickens . . . under the same roof with them . We Texans are at least half-civilized and have sense enough to desire cleanliness . I guess that is the reason we do n't especially care for them cluttering up our towns and cities . . . . <P> ( 52/c ) MARTIN J. MOXLEY , U.S.N. <P> Bainbridge , Md . <P> Sirs : <P> That 's a good piece in your magazine- " Mexico-Bad Neighbors . " That matter needs some airing , and you did it very well . <P> R. P. MARTINEZ Washington , D.C. <P> Sirs : <P> Difficult as it is for a native Texan to admit anything unfavorable concerning his state , I am afraid that your article relative to the discrimination against Mexicans was a body blow . I blushed with shame after reading it because I knew too well how true it was . A majority of the people of this state feel that the only good Mexicans are dead . . . . <P> After dealing with them as a school principal , coach and Boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were . . . the most obedient , as well as the most appreciative , of any students I have ever dealt with . . . . <P> It is not difficult to conclude that the bitter feeling most Texans have against them is due to what happened over 100 years ago , combined with present-day ignorance and prejudice . <P> GENE HOLLON <P> Kerrville , Tex .
