INSIDE U.S.A. ( 979 pp. ) - John Gunther-Harper ( $5 ) . <P> Sooner or later , it was bound to happen : Journalist John Gunther , who has made a tidy fortune exploring the " insides " of Europe , Asia and Latin America , would some day try to get " inside " the U.S. He has , at last-about as far inside as he ever gets . His conclusion ( in a phrase he picked up from Robert E. Sherwood ) : the U.S. is " lousy with greatness . " <P> To his publishers , who are using all the paper they can find to print it ( they expect Inside U.S.A. to be the biggest-selling $5 book ever published ) , and $40,000 to promote it , Gunther 's book is the event of the year . It is unlikely to outlast the year . Like a large proportion of bestsellers , this is journalism between boards . It will shove neither Bryce 's American Commonwealth nor the WPA State Guides off the shelf ; it is neither as penetrating as the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gunther , the most successful living practitioner of his kind of journalism ( a mixture of Burton Holmes , Drew Pearson , Walter Winchell and the World Almanac ) is highly readable . His writing is brisk and breezy . It is also glib , superficial , exaggerated , full of impressions passing as insights and facts palmed off as truths . This is probably the best of his books , certainly the best since Inside Europe , which had some excellent eyewitness reporting of Austria in the turbulent days of Dollfuss . <P> <P> On the Run . Blond , hefty ( 225 lbs . ) John Gunther has developed a rapid-transit system for writing books . His field trips for Inside Asia ( 1939 ) took a mere eleven months , for Inside Latin America ( 1941 ) only five . Now he has explored the 48 states on a jaunt lasting slightly more than a year . He has written a lot of letters ( including one to every governor ) , interviewed many , and pumped a lot of local newsmen , some of whom are very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highly flattered by such attention from one of journalism 's most renowned panjandrums . <P> Gunther starts his zip-clip saga in California , the Golden State ( " ripe , golden , yeasty " ) , swings a great northeasterly arc across the Middle West to the Atlantic , drops south into the Cotton Belt , winds up down Texas-New Mexico-Arizona way , scattering his judgments as he goes . Samples : <P> Cleanest U.S. city : Phoenix , Ariz . Most romantic cities : San Francisco , New Orleans , Boston , San Antonio . <P> Dirtiest city : Indianapolis , " unkempt . . . unswept . . . a terrific place for basketball . . . auto racing . . . the American Legion . " <P> Most turbulent cities : Chicago , " as full of crooks as a saw with teeth " ; Kansas City , Mo. , " the best boogie-woogie town " in the land , " a kind of middle-western Babylon . " <P> Ugliest city : Knoxville , " intense , concentrated , degrading ugliness , " mixed with a backwoods piety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no Sunday movies . <P> Bawdiest city : Butte ( " with the possible exception of Amarillo , Texas " ) . " Whole neighborhoods in Butte are moldy , whole streets are rotten and decaying . The bars are preposterous and prodigious . I saw grandmothers teaching six-year-old kids to play slot machines .
