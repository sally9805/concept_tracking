Food Administrator Claude Wickard picked a logical but startling time . Right after dinner last Sunday night , when well-stuffed U.S. citizens were ready to tune in on their favorite comedians , he went on a coast-to-coast radio hookup to spread the worst food news yet : hard &; fast rationing of canned , dried and frozen fruits and vegetables . <P> Foodman Wickard hastily explained that there was no real shortage of these foods : supplies are the biggest ever . Big hitch is that the Army , Navy and Lend-Lease will gobble up about half 1943 's production , leave only 33 Ib. for every U.S. citizen against a pre-war consumption of 46 Ib . The only choice was rationing , under a point system to be started when new ration books are ready in February . <P> Painfully aware of the grocery runs started by other rationing announcements , Information Director Elmer Davis prefaced Claude Wickard 's shocker with an explanation and a plea . Everybody knew that it would be better to keep rationing plans secret until they were ready to be enforced , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hundreds of thousands of grocers and to 1,500,000 Office of Price Administration volunteers ; " partial and mistaken stones " of the plans were bound to get around ; " it seemed best to tell the people tonight what is intended and why . " <P> Added Elmer Davis : " It is perfectly true that this interval gives chiselers and hoarders a chance to stock up , if they are so inclined-and if they can get away with it . But I am confident that the over-whelin.ing majority of the American people are patriotic enough , and sensible enough , not to try to do that . . . . " <P> Some would disregard Elmer Davis ' plea . But many citizens already were being rationed unofficially by their grocers . Most Americans greeted the announcement with a shrug of the shoulders-and wondered what comes next .
