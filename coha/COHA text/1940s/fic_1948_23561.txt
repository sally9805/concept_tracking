Meeting Time A Story by John D. Weaver Illustrations by Lou Block T HE men , still drowsy from the long sermon , leaned against the big locust trees in front of the log church , while the women closed in like fox hounds around the Reverend Poplum . The men scratched their backs on the locust trunks , took out snuff and tobacco , making ready for the long wait . They knew the women would n't leave until they found out something about the new wife the preacher had brought home from his summer revival week . " Maybe the heat do n't agree with the new Mrs. Poplum , " Mrs. Mark Cass said , fretting her bluebird breastpin . " Hot , awright , " the preacher said . The women would n't have known about the new wife if one of the Anderson girls had n't gone up to the preacher 's house Friday morning with a basket of hen eggs , and when she spotted a woman 's red head through the window , the preacher told her he 'd gotten married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run straight down the hill to tell the Widow Curtis , because in the three months since the death of the last Mrs. Poplum. all Creek Orchard had expected the Widow and the preacher to make a match of it . The Reverend Poplum was not a man to go through a bleak Blue Ridge winter unmarried . " Late , " the preacher mumbled . " Gitting late . " He glanced helplessly for an opening in the wall of women , then suddenly wheeled and plunged between Mrs. Hawg Waller and Mrs. Senn Fenster . " Ca n't keep Birdie waiting . " he said . The women smiled and rustled their custard-colored fans . At least they knew her name now . They turned and went back to their men , saying the name over to themselves . Birdie . They wondered if that was her baptized name or just a play name , the kind a man makes up for a woman before her newness wears off . A ITER dinner , while Mark Cass was sleeping in the porch swing , Mrs. Cass filled a covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the gray , rutted pike which wound through the Virginia hills between Royalton and Cassville . The Reverend Popham lived in a small yellow frame house tucked like a rabbit box in the hillside just above Cass Creek . There was a broad flower bed , now overgrown , on one side of the house and a rock garden on the other . ( The preacher 's first wife had gone in for flowers , the second for rocks . ) As she half-circled the preacher 's vegetable garden , hidden from the house by a thick fringe of pines , Mrs. Cass could see another woman heading up from the mill ruins across the creek . She could tell it was Mrs. Senn Fenster because of the slight limp ( a flat iron had fallen on her left foot one winter , and the bones had n't healed right ) . Mrs. Cass sat down on a walnut stump to wait . Then Mrs. Hawg Waller came jogging across the plank bridge trying to catch up with Mrs. Fenster . " Just a li'l somepun for the preacher 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , holding up her covered dish . " Now ai n't that right queer ? " Mrs. Waller said . " Lobelia'n me got the same notion . " Mrs Fenster had tomato preserves . Mrs. LValler had ham and cottage cheese . The women filed singly up the path , Mrs. Cass leading , of course . The Cass family was not only the oldest family in Creek Orchard , but they also had a town named after them , and a creek . Mrs. Waller came next ; her husband drew good wages for stone-masoning . Mrs. Fenster limped along behind the other two . Senn Fenster hired out by the day . The preacher met them at the door , thanked them for their covered dishes , then led diem around to the front porch . He invited them to chair a while , but the women said they could n't stay but only just a minute , they had to get back to their men . We want you'n Mrs. Poplum to come take dinner with us next Sunday , " Mrs. Cass said , peering in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " but I 'll have to speak to Birdie . She 's got her own ways of . . . " He broke off abruptly as they all caught a flash of red hair streaking into the kitchen . The door slammed shut . The preacher coughed and walked them to the footpath . He looked tired . " Do n't count on it , " he told Mrs. Cass . " Do n't count on nothing for sure . " Rs . CASS went home , changed into her Sunday house dress , washed the . Mdinner dishes , then sat down in her rocker , watching the late afternoon shadows blanket the glitter of the creek rapids . Mark Cass lay on his back in the swing , the top two buttons of his pants undone . He slept with his farm journal over his face . He made gurgling noises . Suddenly Mrs. Cass stopped rocking . The Widow Curtis was puffing hurriedly up the path . Mrs. Cass walked down to meet her . " I just come from the Rewunt 's , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Her face was red and shiny with sweat . " Whatever she is , " Mrs. Cass said , " she 's the Revrunt 's wife now , and we ought a try'n forget the past in the hope of .... " " No , not that , " the Widow said . Mrs. Cass drew the Widow over to a large flat rock which lay on the ground like a drying board . The Widow sat down . " She 's a preacher , " the Widow said . " A woman preacher . " Mrs. Cass sat down on the rock beside the Widow , who squared around with her hands on her knees , and her face had the pleased look of a woman with a great deal more to report . " She was preaching at the ' rival , " the Widow said . " Thas how the Revrunt come to meet her . " Mrs. Cass nodded . " He married his second at ' rival time , " she said . " He just gits carried away . " " And you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was plain she had been saving this for last . " Next Sunday she 's gon na preach for the Revrunt . " ' When Mrs. Cass said nothing , the Widow turned to study her face . It was pale , but without expression . " You hear me ? She 's gon na preach here . " " I heard you , " Mrs. Cass said . She stared at the ground , her mind a churn of red hair and revivals and thoughts of the days to come . The Reverund Poplum had been with them for twenty years . He had buried the Gasses ' oldest boy , married their two girls , sat up with Mark the night he nearly died of the pneumonia . They were used to the preacher , and he was used to them . His church was the one thing that held them all together ; it was the one place where everybody met , and in the hard winters the preacher was the only person who carried news from one house to the other . A new preacher might change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well ? " the Widow said . Mrs. Cass knew that whatever she said now would within an hour be repeated in every home in the Creek Orchard hills . She trembled under the weight of her responsibility . " I better git back to Mark ' fore he starts calling me , " Mrs. Cass said . It was , within the memory of Mrs. Cass 's generation , the first time she had not expressed an opinion , usually the final word , on a local issue . T fur Monday seemed to most of the Creek Orchard women the longest day of recent years , but Tuesday was twice as long , and by Wednesday even the men were getting restless . They sat on the counter of Gus Falk 's store , talking crops and fishing , then working the conversation around to the new MTS . Popham . Flute Figgins , who had not been to church for twenty years , said he was going to be in the first row next Sunday . " You 'll have to git there early , " Mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll git there early , " he said , and Bettem Curry pulled out a fresh dollar bill . " Dollar says I beat you . " Mark . Cass held the stakes . Friday the Anderson girl got a good look at Mrs. Poplum . After she left the hen eggs with the preacher , the Anderson girl hid inthe bushes back of the springhouse until Mrs. Poplum came outside . Mrs. Anderson rushed the girl up to the store to tell what she 'd seen . and the people bought her penny candy and ice cream sticks and licorice whips . Even Mrs. Cass came to hear how Mrs. Poplum had marched out into the side yard , with " her hair redder than a bresh fire . " She was taller than the preacher , the child said , and when she hollered at him , " he jumped like a snake bit him , lie was that scared . " Mrs. Cass gave the Anderson girl a nickel to spend , and then Tad Sherman came in and the child began the story again . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hysteria . Later she was sick at her stomach . As Sunday drew nearer , the restlessness became more difficult to bear . Saturday was such a disquieting day the men left the fields early and gathered at the store , while the women fussed and fretted around their kitchens , and when Mrs. Hawg Waller called on Mrs. Cass , she told her , " I just could n't set hom'n wait by myself . " Mrs. Cass nodded . " I tell you what I done today , " Mrs. Cass said . " I got all my good china and washed and dried it so hard I almost wore the flowers off . " They fixed a pot of coffee and drank it in the kitchen . The men , crowding into Gus Falk 's store , drank pop until Flute Figgins showed up . Then they drank white whisky , and when that ran out , Luther Mills set up a gallon of apple brandy he 'd been saving against the day of his oldest daughter 's getting married . After that was gone , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where . The men began to throw black walnuts at one another . They went wading in the creek , sang hill songs , did jig dances and listened to old Brick Slater tell stories of the great whisky drinkers of his youth . Luther Mills fell in the creek . Bettem Curry got three terrapins and won fifty cents racing them . Flute Figgins threw rocks at the schoolhouse until he 'd broken every window pane . He said that was what had been the ruin of him , schooling . " They put more in my head than it 'd hold . " Bettem Curry bet Turk Tucketinan and Tad Sherman they could drove it into the creek ; they just sat in the front seat , laughing and drinking and singing until they fell asleep . They slept all night with the creek washing quietly over the floor boards . The younger men picked fights and the older men made bets , with Luther Mills starting new fights when the natural ones gave out , then the younger men went looking- for girls and the older men sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their young days , girls long since married or dead or moved away . Brick Slater spoke for them all when he said , " They was harder to git at , but it was worth the trouble , ' cause when you got one , you got a lot more woman . " HEN the sun came up over the Hogback , Flute Figgins was lying in a ditch , his arms covered with cuts from the schoolhouse glass . His blue shirt had a red front like a dickey . Luther Mills had fallen into a well , and it took four men to haul him out . Gus Falk was sleeping on the front porch of his store . his face bruised purple from . the whacking of his wife 's broom when he 'd tried to stagger to the bed . Mark Cass was sleeping on the ground beside the store , his head on a mossy rock . One shoe was missing . Somebody had lifted Brick Slater 's false teeth and put them in the store window with a tomato stuffed in them . Ted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an argument with Tuck Tuckerman . They fell to fighting and Tuck got his nose broken . Oldtimers , surveying the wreckage and piecing together the broken stories which had begun to sift down from the hills , agreed there had not been another such night since Wilson was elected the second time and old Senator Brundage set up a hogshead of rye whisky for the poll-watchers . The men limped into the church with swollen heads and bruised faces , their eyes red-webbed and heavy with the loss of sleep . They held their heads as though they were loose . Everybody came except Brick Slater , I even if the lady preacher had two heads and who said he would n't set foot inside a church both of them red . The women came in their Sunday finery , their faces pale and strained from the long wait . Mrs. Senn Fenster had sat up all night finishing the new dress she 'd started in June for Mrs. Sill Lawman 's funeral , and had put aside when Mrs. Lawman took a turn for the better . Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lectern , and her face was like carved hickory . An hour before services the church was packed , the overflow spilling out into the yard , crowding around the open windows . Flute Figgins did n't get his front row seat , but he got inside , standing by the sun window , scratching the lobe of his left ear . Bettem Curry was standing behind him , his lips moving as he mumbled to himself ; it was a nervous habit of Bettem 's , making bets with himself . The men pressed against the throbbing in their heads , the women stirred their church fans , the children squirmed and whispered , and then there was a streak of red , a glory shout , and a voice that struck like lightning . Afterward , still shaken , their eyes glazed with shock , they stood in the locust shade outside and stared at one another in disbelief . They tried to remember what it had been like in that log building where the chinked walls had seemed to shake , where men had trembled and women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wonder . They saw the Lattimore twins helping Mrs. Luther Mills to her car , and they remembered how she had fallen to the floor , moaning . and writhing and speaking the unknown tongue . Seeing her now , with the strength drained from her body , and remembering the babble of terror and repentance , they tried to connect what had happened inside with the reality of the familiar churchyard around them . They looked at Flute Figgins and wondered if lie had really thrown a whisky bottle out of the window and vowed never to touch it again . Bettem Curry had thrown a deck of playing cards , Mark Cass a sack of smoking tobacco . Miss Tassie Tuckerman had sobbed out the story of her evil ways with Lard Mansion . " I was studying Mrs. Mark Cass , " Bettem Curry said , pressing against a locust trunk to still the shaking of his body . " She had a fan in her left hand , and I was betting myself I could count to fifty ' fore she started to fan herself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shout , and it felt like the voice was coming right at me . . . . " " It was n't only at you , " Flute Figgins said . " It was straight into you like a knife . Thas when I throwed the whisky and took my vow . " In the telling and retelling they found some measure of comfort and relief , but for final reassurance they needed to see the woman again and hear the strange , terrifying voice in the open , where it might , perhaps , be less frightening . It had always been the custom for the preacher to come outside and speak with them after services , but Birdie had already left . Not , however , so quickly or so quietly as Lard Manston . " I feel better for gitting up and telling it all straight out , " Miss Tassie Tuckerman said . Gus FALK 'S store next morning the fla-T voring set peddler offered to bet two dollars the next car to come over the new cement culvert would have a license plate ending in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The peddler said he 'd bet it was an odd number . Bettem Curry walked out to the porch and slammed the door . Flute Figgins went to town , bought glass and putty , and repaired all the schoolhouse windows . Luther Mills emptied two Mason jars of white whisky into Cass Creek . It killed four perch and a chub . Gus Falk went over his store books and found he 'd overcharged some of his account customers . He gave them credit for the amount of the mistakes . Mrs. Falk flung herself out of the store , wailing , " He 's ruining me ! " Lard Manston married Tassie Tuckerman . By the end of the week the price of mountain whisky had dropped from three dollars a gallon to a dollar and a half , and Gus Falk had moved all of his smoking and chewing tobacco back to the storeroom . He said there was no use wasting shelf space on it . Nobody bought the stuff now except old Brick Slater , then Brick came down with a terrible sickness , and everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Waller 's gone plumb out of his head , " Mrs. Waller told Mrs. Cass . " He wo n't work for wages no more . Spends all his time down at the church masoning ' em a wall for free . I declare he 's gon na land us in the poor farm . " Ad Findlay sold the gold out of his teeth and paid up all his debts . What he had left over he offered the Reverend Poplum for the church . " it 's mighty nice of you , Ad , " the preacher said , " but you got your family to think of . You better keep it for a rainy day . " " Do n't it say in Scripture that money is the root of all evil ? " " No , Ad . It says the love of money . You put your cash somewhere safe against a sudden sickness . " Ad kept the money , but he told it all over Creek Orchard ; he said it was a pity and a shame the Reverend Poplum did n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Cass . She was crying . " The things Mark Cass says to me , it 's awful . Thirty years he ai n't hardly raised his voice to me , nor me to him , except only when he 's sleeping too hard to hear , but now he 's quit smoking and when that ' bacco craving hits ' im , he yells at me like I was a hound dog and deaf to boot . " The preacher shook his head . He said what he could , then he turned to go . He said it was time he got home and fixed supper . " You mean she do n't even cook your meals ? " Mrs. Cass said , and the preacher nodded . Mrs. Cass took the preacher by the arm . " Now you just set down there and read the paper till I git my supper ready . " 1 T hill ways , and she do n't . She 's got her own ideas . " Mrs. Cass snorted . " Ideas ! " She flounced out to the kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helpings of everything , and three of the spoon bread . Then Mrs. Cass made him take off his socks , and he sat in the big easy chair , smoking and wiggling his toes , while Mrs. Cass darned the holes . Then she poured him a little glass of elderberry wine . " Take some more , " she said when he drained the glass . " Mark wo n't touch it no more . " " They 's no harm in it , " the preacher said . " It 's like everything else . You can make it a bad thing by using it wrong , or a good thing by using it right . " Sitting in the easy chair with the red wine glass , the preacher did not look tired any more . He reminded Mrs. Cass of the old days when he had always been first at the apple butter boilings and the wedding suppers , laughing when Bettem Curry waved a five-dollar bill and bet the first child would be a boy , clapping for Flute Figgins to do his sword dance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men together over a Mason jar and told wedding night jokes . Girls were grown and married and had children of their own who had been baptized by the Reverend Poplum , and boys he 'd driven to school in a borrowed hay wagon before the county got the yellow school bus were voting and farming . Graves , where the preacher had stood over the raw clay to speak the parting words . had become overrun with vines and briers. and even the oldest people were hard put to remember what it was like in Creek Orchard before the preacher came there , a young man then , who used to take his turn in the fields . " Whas ' at I smell ? " Mark Cass roared when he came home . He took another whiff of the preacher 's tobacco smoke and glared at the little wine glass , and he said it was a fine example to be setting the people . The preacher smiled and said Mark sounded like Mrs. Poplum . Mark stormed and raged , said he would n't hear nothing said in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks , " Mark said , " she 's uncovered more sin and wrongdoing than you 'd of turned up in a lifetime . " The preacher put on his socks and shoes . He got up slowly , as though pushing against a great weight . There was no bitterness in his voice . " She 's turned up the bad and ai n't seen the good . " ARK CASS was up at Gus Falk 's store first thing next morning , railing against the preacher for his wine-drinking and cigarette-smoking , and Ad Findlay told about his gold-tooth money . The men nodded , and all agreed the preacher 's easy ways were to blame for the backsliding and heavy sinning that used to go on in Creek Orchard before Birdie rescued them . The Reverend Poplurn had for twenty years preached the same four sermons , Salvation , Good Works , Doctrine , and Charity , alternating them from month to month , but Birdie had only one sermon : Sin . When the preacher came to the store , the men seemed busy with their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed the door , and for a long time nobody saw him except Brick Slater . Every night the preacher used to walk up to Brick 's house and sit by the bed , talking about the old days . Birdie took over the baptizings and the prayer meetings and the Sunday services . When Luther Mills 's oldest daughter got married , Birdie performed the ceremony , then carne to the wedding supper . Everybody stood around drinking sweetened water and look lug at his watch . Mark Cross fell asleep talking politics with Ad Findlay . Somebody asked Bettem Curry what he bet the first child would be , and Bettem marched out of the room . Nobody asked Flute Figgins to do his sword dance . It was hardly dark when everybody went home , and on the way Mrs. Cass suddenly smiled and told one of Mark 's old marriage jokes , thinking it might cheer him up . Mark said she ought to cut out her tongue before she made such talk with it . Nobody except Brick Slater ever saw the Reverend Poplum any more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all over the hills , and into everything that went on . The women began to notice her eyes , which always scented to get narrower when she talked . The men said her voice , when she talked natural was n't like her preaching : it had a kind of rusty sound , and Ad Findlay said she did n't have any laugh in it , like the Reverend . Theydiscovered other differences , taa , small things which must have been th-re ail along , although they 'd never taken notice of them . Luther Mills probably put it as well as any when he remarked one day , " I wish I could be as sure of just one thing as she is of everything . " Mrs. Annis took to her bed with the pleurisy , and sent for the preacher , but Birdie came instead , and she did n't read Scripture or talk about what a fine man Mr. Annis had been . She simply said Mrs. Annis looked healthy as a horse and ought to be ashamed of herself , staying in the bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the town doctor and he gave her a sleeping pill , but she was too mad to sleep . " They 's human limits , " Mrs. Mark Cass said . " What she do n't realize , her with that red hair and fire talking , is people got limits . " Then Brick Slater died , and what happened was like all the dynamite in Virginia going off underneath Buck Mountain . B RICK SLATER was an old man , even by hill counting , and he was in many ways a mean , disagreeable man . He 'd always voted against the Organization , even when they put up Brick 's own brother for sheriff . During the fishing season he used to fish in the deep holes in front of his house , and he 'd hold his pole in one hand and his shotgun in the other , just in case anybody tried to fish on his land . Brick Slater was a hard-drinking man , and when he got mad , his language would blister a rock wall , but Brick Slater was kin to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was like the end of something that had been going on for a long time and , although a lot of people had n't liked it , still it had been part of their growing up , and now that it was gone , they felt the loneliness of it , and they tried to remember nice things Brick had done , and , failing that , they tried to forget the mean things . Birdie scat word she would n't preach the funeral . The women said nothing . They went to Brick 's widow and helped in small ways , with food and housecleaning , and in the larger ways of what they said . The widow was sur prised and grateful . She was new to Creel Orchard . Brick had brought her up fron Culpeper only a few years ago . She had no expected such a turnout for Brick . The men went to see Birdie , and she told diem Brick Slater was an evil , unrepenting man , and she 'd have nothing to do with him . Birdie , like the widow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Brick Slater . She could n't know how Brick was linked with the lives of even the oldest people in the hills , and nobody , young or old , expected to live to see quite such another man again . The day of the funeral three men walked up to the preacher 's house , Mark Cass , Ad Findlay , and Senn Fenster . Mark Cass knocked on the door , and nobody answered , so he knocked again , louder , and finally Birdie came to the door , and Mark said he 'd like to speak to the preacher . I " I 'm the preacher , " Birdie said , and Mark pushed past her into the room , where the Reverend Poplum was standing by the heating stove . " Reckon you heard about poor Brick , " Mark said , and the preacher nodded . " It 's time for his funeral , " Mark said , and when the preacher moved back , glancing at Birdie , Mark said , " You'n Brick knowed each other . He 'd want the parting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , " the preacher said , " I knowed Brick right well . " Birdie 's hands squeezed shut and her eyes u-ere strangely bright . " You know how he lived , " she said , " and how he died . " Her voice grew gradually louder and was not pleasant to hear . ' ' They tell me there was the smell of corn whisky on the deathbed . " The preacher hesitated , then he turned to Mark . " I 'll git my hat . " " I 'll wait outside , " Mark said . They buried Brick in a wild plum grove back of his house , on a hill overlooking the creek , and the preacher told about Brick Slater as a man who had lived with them for a long time . He went back over the years ; he spoke of floods and blights , the boom years and the wars and old customs that had died before Brick , and the women wept for vague and unaccountable things that had nothing to do with the old man who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and were moved by the voice which was so closely linked to their Jives . You live with people for twenty years , " the preacher said . " You baptize ' em and marry ' em and set with ' ern in the time of sickness and death . You watch the young ones grow up and the old ones die off , and there ai n't a thing you do n't know about your people , except when it comes down to one man , and you ask yourself , Do I really know this man ? You know so little , and even if you knowed more , it would n't be enough to say for sure that he was a good man or bad . It would n't ever be enough . " Sunday , when the Reverend Poplum came back to his pulpit , Bettem Curry bet Flute - Figgins two dollars he 'd preach Doctrine . Bettem lost . He preached Charity .
