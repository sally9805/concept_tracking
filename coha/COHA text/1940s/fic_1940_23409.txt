40412-6i0 A TICKET TO MEXICO A STORY BY FRANCES CRANE r-r wo hours or so out of Monterrey I Deborah Shannon went into the club car for a lemonade . For half an hour she had been annoyed by the bickering of an elderly couple who occupied the drawing-room in her Pullman . They kept the door open and their voices carried to Deborah 's seat . They seemed to have come to Mexico on some diplomatic visit , but diplomacy with them was exclusively a public condition . Deborah settled herself in one of the two big chairs facing the rear platform and the suave Mexican porter fetched the drink . Beyond the plate-glass windows the desert panorama began unfurling more slowly as the train started its long ascent to the city of Saltillo . " Nothing else , ma'am ? " " Nothing . " The man bowed deeply and went to the other end of the car . Deborah was glad to be alone . She was inclined to attract people and with them their troubles , and she had her own which required all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intended to divorce him . Five years of quarrels , rages , panics , tears , and tender reconciliations had preceded her walking out and buying , entirely of her own sweet will , this ticket to Mexico . A ticket to Mexico ! There was humor in that too . Last year , after months ' planning , Michael in one of his moments had canceled their visit to Mexico . Thus the ticket to Mexico symbolized her regainedindependence . She was free . If she wanted a ticket to Mexico or anywhere else now she could step out and get it . There was some satisfaction in that . " Magazines , ma'am ? " The porter laid them on a low table at her side . " Thank you . " " Is the air comfortable , ma'am ? " " Quite . " " The air-conditioning , ma'am , makes a great improvement on this run . I 've been making it for twenty years and am in a position to know . It 's well over a hundred right out there in the desert . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deborah snapped him off with a twinge of conscience because he so obviously enjoyed talking . Her liking to make people happy amounted to a vice . She meant to correct that too . The man retired softly to his buffet . Deborah opened her bag for a handkerchief . Her wedding ring fell from its folds into her Iap . She restored it to her coin purse . She had been trying for three days to remember to put it in the jewel box locked in her dressing case . The mind , she recalled , forgets what it does n't really want to do . Contrariwise , she argued back , it is the mind 's doing , this removal of the ring , along with the marriage , while there 's any will left for doing it . Yes , she was glad . She rejoiced at having a will which , with one gesture , could sever a union still for the most part happy but bound eventually to flop . " Will you object if I sit back here ? " asked a low interesting voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face and smoky gray hair . She had got on yesterday afternoon at Dallas . She indicated the chair next Deborah 's . " No , of course not , " Deborah said mechanically . She grudged the intrusion but not as much as she should have done . " I 've broken my dark glasses . There 's less glare here at the back . " " Much less . " " Another highball , Manuelo , " the young woman said . After that she was silent . She was not one , Deborah soon realized , who would unnecessarily intrude . Thereupon Deborah decided she 'd like to have her intrude . She began glancing at her with curiosity . The delicate cameo beauty , the too-early gray hair made Deborah regard her own conventional wholesome good looks as rather crude . The young woman seemed to have plenty of bad habits however . She smoked endlessly . She had even had a whiskey with breakfast . Manuelo brought the highball . " I meant to ask last evening about Gita , Manuelo , " the woman said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine , Mrs. Cheney , ma'am . " " And Lupe ? " " The same , ma'am . Very well in-deed . " " I 'm glad to hear it . I can see that you 're still very happy . " " Yes , indeed , ma'am , " Manuelo said , with enthusiasm . " Well , happiness is what matters , Manuelo . " " Oh , yes , ma'am . " " And , if I may say so , Manuelo , you arc one of the few people I 've ever met in all my life who knows the secret . Of happiness , I mean . " " Why , thank you , ma'am . " Manuelo made a deep bow and added , in the best Texan-Mexican style , " I sure thank you , Mrs. Cheney , ma'am . " Mrs. Cheney turned to the desert and Manuelo took himself off . Some time passed . It was Deborah who broke this silence . " What strange cacti ! " she exclaimed , indicating some curious distorted objects with thick trunks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're really awful ! " Mrs. Cheney 's deep blue gaze drifted to Deborah , " This entire landscape is disgusting . I loathe it . I 'm afraid of flying or nothing would induce me to make this trip again . " " You 've done it before ? " " Too often . " There was a silence . That is all , Deborah thought , hungrily , I 'll ever know about her . She is mysteriously interesting , but why I shall never know . Ships that pass in the night . " Cigarette ? " Mrs. Cheney broke in on her thoughts . " Oh . Thanks , I never smoke . " " That is very intelligent . " " I disagree . I dislike tobacco . But I approve of smoking . It 's companionable . " " In that case , " Mrs. Cheney said with a charming crooked smile , " I should never be lonely . " " Are you ? " " Terribly . " Terribly . How gallant she was about it though . Now , Deborah thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to know why she was lonely when so beautiful , and how she carried her loneliness with such grace . But her chances were spoiled for the time by the arrival of the doll-faced woman in polka-dots with the little boy . The child ran to Deborah and laid his face against her knee . " Hello , " he said . Their section was opposite Deborah 's in the Pullman . They had spoken last night . " Hello . How old are you , Debbra ? " " Bascom ! " His mother screwed up her pretty face with appropriate shock at the child 's familiarity with a stranger . He ignored her . He was three , he chattered , going on four . Deborah smiled into his little face . She was twenty-three , she said , going on twenty-four . His mother again reproved him , seating herself behind and across from Deborah . Bascom next gave out the information that he was William Bascom Bradford and his daddy called him Bill . Deborah could call him Bill if she wanted to . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained hastily , that made Bascom act as he did . Mr. Bradford , she said , owned a silver mine up near Guanajuato . They lived in a dump of a town and were the only white people in the place . Deborah ought to see it . A dozen windowless adobe huts and one decent Spanish style house , their own , which was walled in all round . Terrible . Why she returned there she did not know . She did n't know , in fact , why anybody did anything . Life was really awful , did n't Deborah think so ? Mrs. Cheney soon rose quietly and Ieft them . Mrs. Bradford promptly appropriated her chair . " You do n't know that woman , do you ? " she asked , with hardly a break in her doleful tones . " She 's a queer one . Drinks like a fish , if you ask me , but she looks so refined and she 's dressed so nice  --  that suit 's tailored to order by the best house in Dallas , if I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . Manuelo ? " " Yes , ma'am ? " " Do you know that woman ? " " Mrs. Cheney ? Yes , ma'am . She 's a lovely lady . She make this trip several times now . " " Know anything about her , I mean ? " Deborah recoiled spontaneously against any such information from Manuelo ( in spite of hoping privately he would give out something very interesting ) and said , " May I treat your little boy to a lemonade , Mrs. Bradford ? " " I would n't want you to pay for it . " " It would give me pleasure . " " Okay . Next time though the drinks will be on me . " Mrs. Bradford , after an effort to restrain herself , next asked , " Are you married , or are n't you ? I always say you can tell . But you do n't wear a ring . " " It 's a little too large , " Deborah lied . " I often put it in my bag . " " They say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Mrs. Bradford , eyeing her circlet of platinum and diamonds glumly . " Maybe so . Maybe not . I never take mine off and I have only bad luck . " She added , as if in the same sentence , " I expected a wire from Bill at Monterrey . Maybe it 'll be at Saltillo . Maybe he wo n't wire , the way he did once before . It about drove me nuts , waiting all day with no word and thinking I 'd be getting off the train all alone in the night . Lordee ! " Mrs. Bradford 's depression presently drove Deborah back to her Pullman . For the moment the diplomatic pair in the drawing-room were on good terms . The door was open but silence prevailed . She was knitting and he was reading . Deborah now could n't get the Brad-fords out of her mind . The child was gently , finely made ; like , his mother had said , his father . Bascom , she said , was her maiden name . This seemed excuse enough to inflict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her duty . She had revealed in the life expose which resulted from Deborah 's buying the lemonade that when she was a girl she had worked in a shop near San Antonio Station and that one day Bill Bradford walked in after five years in the wilds of Mexico and set down his suitcase . " I was the first white woman he 'd spoken to in all that time , " she had said . " We got married in a week . Bill 's a Harvard graduate , " she went on proudly but had added ruefully , " I was going steady with a boy owning his own grocery . Now he 's got a chain of six and a swell new home in the best suburb of San Antone . Married my girl friend , mind you . You never know what you 're lined up for , do you ? It 's okay saying you 've got a silver mine , but what 's there to owning anything in Mexico these days ? " " You 've got Bascom , " Deborah had said rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with kids than without anyhow . But it 's harder to get away . For good , I mean . You got to think of the children . " Suddenly Mrs. Bradford laughed and whispered , " Manuelo there has fifteen . He 's got two families , you know . Gita 's in San Antone and Lupe 's in Mexico City . He thinks divorce is immoral . " At Saltillo Deborah got off quickly and began walking briskly up and down the platform . There was a stop of twenty minutes . A delegation of local dignitaries in top hats had come to the train to meet the diplomatic pair  --  there had been a similar greeting in Monterrey --  and for the moment they were hiding their chronic annoyance with each other under little public bows and smiles . Mrs. Cheney crossed the tracks and entered the station . Mrs. Bradford , dragging Bascom with her , hurried to the telegraph office . A telegraph boy was ambling back and forth calling out somebody 's name . The air was cool and sweet . Deborah could see the facades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered platform . Lacy pepper and fruit-laden orange trees were visible over low cream-colored walls . Indians in snow-white pajamas and great peaked hats offered shallow baskets , pretty as pictures , with arrangements in high-colored fruit . All the traffic of the place was slow and effortless . A tall well-dressed thin man with smart luggage got on to the train . " Meeshano , " the telegraph boy idly repeated , strolling up and down . " Meeshano . " Deborah passed and repassed him . She saw Mrs. Cheney coming from the station with a new pair of dark glasses in one hand . Mrs. Bradford tripped back across the tracks , pulling Bascom after her . Mrs. Cheney skimmed along the platform , passing Deborah the first time with a friendly nod . How elegantly she carried herself . How self-sufficient she looked . She walked alone and , you could see , liked to That was how oneought to be . A woman should walk alone proudly . " Yoo-hoo ! " Mrs. Bradford caught up with Deborah . " Say , could you keep Bascom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I ought to have a wire . They say there is n't any . I 'm going to look at the messages myself . I think maybe they got the name wrong . You never can tell with Mexicans . " The child 's hand , soft and warm as a tiny bird , slipped into Deborah 's . Now she walked gently , her step attendant on his . She felt the warm little hand nested confidently in her own . She listened to his talk . Did she like Mehicans ? She ought not to . Mehicans were dirty . They did n't wash their feet before they went to bed . She must not buy those mangoes in that Indian 's basket . They were dirty . Oranges were dirty in Mehico till you took the peel off . Must not eat them . No-o . Did she have any little boys ? Whom , then , did she play with ? Mrs. Cheney , passing , smiled her charming crooked smile at the child . " Mee-shano ? " intoned the telegraph boy , over and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picked her high-heeled way over the tracks . " Nothing , " she said , anxiously . " There 's honestly not a thing . " Automatically she linked herself to Bascom by his other hand . " I 'm worried to death . Maybe Bill did n't get my letter saying to meet us to-night . I wired him too . Maybe he did n't get that . Maybe something 's happened to him down there , and maybe we 'll get dumped off all alone at midnight in the desert , eighty miles from nowhere . " " Daddy will meet us , " Bascom said , assuredly . " Meesh-ano ? " the messenger 's voice went on lazily . " I hope that boy finds who he 's looking for , " Mrs. Bradford said . " Well , such is life . I do n't get a message and somebody who 's sent one is n't here to get it . I guess I 'd better get this kid back into the train . We 'll soon be leaving . " Deborah took another turn of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the club car . Mrs. Cheney was there when she entered , drinking another highball . " Will you have a cocktail or something ? " she invited Deborah . " Lunch will be served here now immediately . " " Thank you . " She asked Manuelo for a sidecar . She seldom drank so early in the day and soon regretted it . The drink depressed her further . " Desolate here , " she said , facing Mrs. Cheney across a luncheon table . Immediately out of Saltillo the desert had closed in again , drier , more raddled than ever . " Awful ! " Mrs. Cheney smilingly leveled her eyes on Deborah 's . " But better than later on . Some people like the desert . I hate it . But I have only myself to blame for having to cross this area again . " " Really ? " Deborah said politely . " I hope you do n't mind confidences ? " " Oh , no , " Deborah said , with a thrill , quite forgetful that only three hours before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's good . I 'm about to make one . I always confide in strangers , do n't you ? By the time you regret it they are usually no longer about . " " I never thought about it just that way . " " All right , here goes . I 'm coming down to Mexico for another divorce . " " Oh , " Deborah said casually . " I thought Mexican divorces no good ? " " They 'll do . If there are no children involved or you do n't try to get property or anything . I 've friends in Mexico City . Make them a visit and have a little fun . Might as well make the best of a dismal business . " " I like the way you 're doing it , " Deborah said . " Not bothered , I mean , by sentiment , " " Oh , I have none in this case . So I do n't deserve your compliment . " Deborah was doing her best to maintain the poker face of an ultra-sophisticate . Buther @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her stride , made it difficult to look blank . Nothing could make a woman like that vulgar either . Whatever she did or said had , for some reason , taste . " Naturally , no marriage I make now will be a success . I was too deeply in love with Edward , my first husband . " The smoky-toned voice had a trill in it now . " He will always he the one . And of course they find that out , sooner or later . The others , I mean . " With fire she announced , " But I would n't live with Edward again and his temperish domination for millions . " " Temper is dreadful , " said Deborah , thinking of Michael Shannon . " But this last is the worst . He sets armies of spies on me , every blessed moment . Why , I got so I felt I must go out and do something shady sometimes so he would get his money 's worth . I had a time making this getaway , I can tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on me ! " " It would n't do you any good , " Mrs. Cheney said practically . " In a way though , I 'd rather be spied on than ignored . Dick was the one for that . " " Dick ? " " My second . " Mrs. Cheney had to raise her voice a little . The diplomat 's wife at the table behind her was arguing against her husband 's ordering shrimps . " But drink is the worst , Mrs. Shannon . " " I do n't know anything about that , " Deborah said , but Mrs. Cheney , she could n't help but think , should be an authority . " Be glad of it , my child . If there 's anything gets on your nerves it 's to live on the nineteenth floor with a man who recurrently tries to take an elevator he sees outside the bedroom window . Delusions , of course . That was Henry . It shattered me completely . I wo n't be a grown man 's guardian , never again anyhow , but espionage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth , for one minute , express her agreement . " The worst of it is you get attached to men like that  --  I mean like Henry  --  just because they 're so dependent on you , Mrs. ? I do n't believe we have met . " " Shannon . Mrs. Michael Shannon , " Deborah said , thinking too late that she was now , to all intents and purposes , Deborah Shannon only . Her name before her marriage had been Jones . She did n't think she would bother to resume it . " I 'm Madeleine Cheney . We were speaking of attachments . It is wrong , always , to Iet a man get a hold on your pity . Nothing good ever comes from that . " " The only thing really , " Deborah now proffered , " is to keep out of their clutches entirely . " " Exactly , " Mrs. Cheney said with enthusiasm , " what I 've said to myself a thousand times . This time I mean to stay by it . No more marriages for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being free . " " Marvelous . One can go anywhere , do anything . I 've money of my own and do n't need the support of these creatures I continue to marry . I 'd love to travel extensively , although somehow I never have . I care nothing about a home except for children , and if I want any children I can adopt far better ones than I could ever produce myself and the place wo n't be all cluttered up with their fathers . I 've said all these things before , Mrs. Shannon , but this time I shall not forget . Manuelo . " The man was about to go for an order from the diplomats but he came to her immediately . " A bottle of your special dry Spanish wine , Manuelo . " To Deborah , " We 'll toast our freedom , Mrs. Shannon . Should I say our ? " " Decidedly , " Deborah answered with pride . At this moment , just when their talk was beginning to glow with perfect understanding , the thin man with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't noted as he got on the train at Saltillo entered and sat down at the table across the aisle . In a tone ageography teacher might use to a promising but not brilliant pupil , Mrs. Cheney continued , " We are crossing the national divide . In a few minutes we drop to a desert plateau which is literally endless , Mrs. Shannon . Astonishing how much desert there is in North America , is n't it ? Manuelo " During mealtimes in his car Manuel() was head-waiter , but having only one assistant , he had to do more than merely supervise . He now brought the wine . At the next table the lady diplomat kept up a running complaint about the slow service . Manuelo polished the wine glasses and lifted the iced bottle with the napkin round its throat . " Yes , Mrs. Cheney ? " He paused to beam at her . " This is the national divide , did n't you say ? " Mrs. Cheney murmured , in a confidential voice . " Continental divide it is called , ma'am . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd picked the wrong hill in pointing it out to Mrs. Shannon . Thank you again , Manuelo . " " Is there anything else , ma'am ? " " Nothing . Thanks so much . " " Well , of all things ! And here we sit , Dan . Why do n't you do something ? " the lady diplomat demanded of the husband . " Shut up , Sarah , " said her husband , and with vehemence . Back in her Pullman , Deborah 's conjurings about Mrs. Cheney for a time wedged out Michael Shannon . The woman 's exquisite face seemed chiseled into her imagination . The flat high-boned cheeks . The beautifully set blue eyes . The thrilling , changeable voice . In spite of the deliberate aplomb , Deborah could see that the woman was really shattered . She was undoubtedly drinking to keep up her nerve . Poor thing . Look how nervously she had leaped from husbands to the silly national divide thing . As if it mattered ! A nervous wreck probably ! Marriage , one way or another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with impact . For some reason Deborah fell to recalling his face , feature by feature . His glorious slow smile . The dark eyes which could make a woman feel that she alone in all the world mattered . His crazy wit . His fiendish periods of indifference . His explosive rages . She reviewed their first meeting , their sudden falling in love , their tempestuous honeymoon . Temper matched temper . hers was slow and enduring . His was quick as fire . His charm was stupendous . She would never love anyone else . Well , what of it ? She was free , was n't she ? And how many people had what she had had behind their freedom ? Love ! The real thing . And if she could n't stand living with Michael when loving him , why not live alone and make the best of things ? Courageous women did . Michael would of course marry again . There were plenty of good fish in the sea , Mike would say , and jump right in and geti one . Sure he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would choose with some discretion . Michael needed a background for his wit and charm . Without a wife and home Michael was a masterpiece minus a frame . Yes , Deborah generously hoped her successor would be a woman of taste , intelligence , warmth , and passable good looks , who would give Michael all she had given and more . Though of course she 'd have to be a jellyfish to stand him . Sure . And Mike honestly would n't like a jellyfish , but let him find that out for himself . Let him . Let him discover what he had lost in Deborah . Let him suffer . Suffer . While she lived and lived . Life lay gaily ahead of her , romance forever behind . Indeed it would serve Michael Shannon quite right if under that gelatinous exterior his next wife was a bitch . " Now , really ! " Deborah snapped herself out of it . She looked round the Pullman . Everybody was dozing . The MAGAZINE diplomats had closed their door , hopefully to enclose peace . Bascom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against a pillow , her painted little mouth askew . Mrs. Cheney was in another coach . The sight of people asleep and off guard was a little painful , and Deborah turned to the desert . She had expelled Michael from her mind . She started watching the road which ran alongside the tracks . It was dry and rutted . Occasional byways wandered from it into the brush . Mountains far away edged the parched plain , at their feet mirages of flat lakes . After a while the landscape in some queer way began to absorb Deborah . She found herself out there following one of the tenuous bypaths off into the sagebrush and cactus waste . Oppression weighed over her . She closed her eyes and was rescued from a thorny death by Michael Shannon . Deborah shook him off and stared resolutely at the desert . The road always followed the tracks . All afternoon it would be there rutted and unchanged . The wizened offshoots appeared and vanished . Who made this road or traveled it ? Whence those paths ? Effortlessly Deborah was off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the earth dragged at her feet , the brush tore at her skirts , and up stepped Michael Shannon . She slapped his phantom face . " That wine ! ' Deborah moaned and , meaning to have done with these visions , went to the dressing room , bathed her face and arms and did her hair over . A change of frock freshened her . She had locked her case and was back in her section before she remembered having again forgotten to change the wedding ring from her purse to her jewel box . " Hello , Debbra . " Bascom had awakened and was standing near her . " Hello , darling . " He climbed up beside her and put his head against her arm and went to sleep again . " Bascom ! " Mrs. Bradford cried shrilly . " Do be quiet . My husband is trying to rest , " said Madam Diplomat , just emerging from the drawing-room . " Pardon me , " Mrs. Bradford said humbly . She dropped in the seat facing Deborah and the sleeping child . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought Bascom had got off the train somehow . In the horrible desert ! " " He 's been here just a minute . " " I had a dream . " Deborah quailed at the very thought of hearing it , but its contents surprised her . " I thought I was back in San Antone in a little home of my own on North Alamo and with everything electrical . There was every kind of electrical gadget in that house you could even think of  --  but it was only a dream . It sure was when you consider the place we live ; in . It 's a palace in those parts , but I do n't see myself ever having anything electrical in it . " She rolled her eyes with despondency . " Bill loves it . He 's nuts about the old tiles and the frescoes in the patio , but I hate the whole works like nothing on this earth . Can you manage your husband or ca n't you ? " " Manage him ? " " Get him to do what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " It sure does . I want to live in San Antone . That 's why I kept staying up there this time . I figured eventually Bill would have to come because he 's crazy about Bascom , but he did n't , so here I am . Anyhow he does n't try to force me to stay down here  --  if he did , I 'd stay away . But all the same I 've got just as much right to my life as he has . " " I want a lemonade , " said Bascom , waking up again . " All right , honey . Do n't you think so ? " she inquired of Deborah again . " A right to your life ? Of course you have . " " Mommy , I want a lemonade . " " Say please , Bascom . I wish you would join us , " she urged Deborah . " It 's my turn to stand the drinks , re-member . " " Thank you , " Deborah accepted . Mrs. Bradford stopped with Bascom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ club car ahead of her . Mrs. Cheney was there , very fresh in a different blouse of dusty pink silk . Her skin looked dainty and her hair gleamed like moonlit silver . " I 'm afraid you thought me very odd at lunch , Mrs. Shannon . " Deborah settled herself and looked interrogative . " I mean , my sudden conversational lurch from husbands to the national divide , or whatever it was Manuelo called the thing . You see , I think that thin man is a detective . " " The good-looking one with the limp ? " " That 's the man . It 's the limp which rouses my suspicion . They limp on one case andi next case they do n't limp . I may be wrong , but any time he looms in view I shall be as discreet as possible . Oh , you do look so intelligent , Mrs. Shannon . You 'd never wreck your life on impulse the way I did . " Deborah responded with a faint lift of her shoulders . " Looks are deceiving , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Always . " With the smile of a dainty sphinx , Mrs. Cheney took from a stylish bag a silver circle set with azure turquoises . " My first wedding ring , " she said , putting it on . " How curious ! " " It 's very old . Its first owner was an Indian princess . " " It 's charming . I 've never seen such turquoise . " " I was just back from Paris . Two years in the Beaux Arts made me believe I was going to be a great artist . Edward felt the same  --  about himself , / mean . And Edward happened to be right . We were living in the artist group in Santa F6 when we were married . Edward was quiet and serious , but I loved being spectacular . For instance , I had a white horse and a black riding habit and a great black sombrero and I used to ride round and round the plaza just so people would look at me . It infuriated Edward . " She laughed gaily . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in emerald green for St. Patrick 's and had my hair dyed to match . " Mrs. Cheney 's mobile Iips curved with tender memory . " I was only twenty-two and it was gray even then . Edward spanked me so hard for that stunt I could n't sit for a week . I was a fool to leave him . I did it on a silly impulse and I 've been sorry ever since . " She mused , " A drunk . One that was cold as ice . And another who hounds me with spies . But of course from now on I 'm sensible . No more husbands , Mrs. Shannon . " " You really do think that man 's a sleuth ? " " Definitely . It 's morbid . But I 've got so everybody 's under suspicion until proved otherwise . I did n't feel that way about you though  --  except just at first . " " My goodness , " Deborah said with sympathy . " But of course " ? Mrs. Cheney broke into her own words ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes , " she stated brightly , " but I prefer Texas . " " What 's that ? " A gesture , a mere wiggle of one of Mrs. Cheney 's manicured fingers , directed Deborah 's glance to the thin man settling himself close by . The one scornful glance Deborah allowed him revealed him nosing idly at a magazine . Mrs. Bradford came in with Bascom . Manuelo stood by for orders . Mrs. Bradford waited for several minutes before letting her curiosity about Mrs. Cheney take word . " You down here on a trip or something ? " she asked then , politely . " Yes , " Mrs. Cheney said , very politely too . " It 's not bad , for a trip . " " I think it 's fine . " " You been here before ? " " Yes . " Mrs. Cheney 's smile was very punctilious . " Mexico City , I suppose ? It 's not bad . I always say to Bill if we could live there and he 'd just make trips out to the mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , see  --  I would n't mind . You can have a good time in Mexico City . " " It 's charming . " " Oh . " Mrs. Bradford was being her starched-and-ironed best , but it was n't getting her along fast enough . " You married ? " she now inquired , but very nice . " Yes . " " Funny ring you 've got . You see plenty like it though among the Indians . " " Oh , this ? " Mrs. Cheney slipped the turquoise circlet into her bag . " Any children ? " " I 'm sorry to say not any . " " Well , there 's advantages both ways when it comes to children . " " Your little boy is adorable , Mrs. Bradford , " Mrs. Cheney offered sweetly . " Do-able , " Bascom echoed , between making noises in his glass with the straw . Time passed . The talk flicked from one to another interest of Woman and the Home . Of the three of them Mrs. Cheney would have passed as the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cheney imparted to Mrs. Bradford the name of a little dressmaker in Dallas who tailored her marvelous suits  --  should the Elysian probability of Mrs. Bradford 's being in Dallas ever become fact . She was , Deborah voted , altogether wonderful , when you knew what a darkness filled her gallant heart . Putting it all on of course for the benefit of the propinquent sleuth . At four the thin man let his magazines slide to the floor and rose to stare through the windows . But the view had not changed . The same road hugged the tracks , the same byways , the flats , the mirages , and far mountains . Manuelo approached and handed Mrs. Cheney a note . She read it and tore it into bits which she put in her bag . " The worst is over , " she announced . All looked startled . " Soon we 'll have sunset . Then dusk and the wonderful night . A Mexican sunset is magnificent , " she informed Deborah . " Ed  --  some one I once knew used to say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I really think it fits . " Her voice grew thrilling . " First a living ball of fire . Then gorgeous immense blobs of color , tremendous color for which there are no words , followed by a quick dusk . A blue dusk . Swiftly the night . A canopy of orange stars against a velvet sky . The air smelling of flowers . " Her voice had taken on a fateful tone , and the thin man was so obviously listening that Deborah felt troubled . She finished , " Soulless flowers , like lilies and gardenias . The flowers of the dead . " Mrs. Bradford was beginning to squirm . " You say the oddest things , " she peeped , but Mrs. Cheney did n't notice . She continued , " Mexico is all so very strange , really . The road along this railroad for instance . Those trails in the brush . My first hus  --  I mean , this friend I spoke of always called them the footpaths of the dead . He said they were made by the souls of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their way home . " " Listen , " Mrs. Bradford cried , " I wish you would n't talk like that . I 'm getting off this train at midnight in country just like this , see . If Bill does n't meet us we 're done for . Why , we could n't last a day out there  --  it 's cool in this train but you 've no idea of the heat in the desert , and if Bill does n't meet this train . . . " " Daddy will meet us , " said Bascom , without pausing in some very satisfying sliding down the back of an upholstered chair . " Of course he will , sweet , " Mrs. Cheney agreed with him . " Such confidence , such trust ! " she murmured to the others , and quite abruptly left them . She paused to speak to Manuelo before leaving the car . When summoned for the bill , Manuelo said she had taken care of it . " Why she ought not to have done that ! " cried Mrs. Bradford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said after a while . " She 's lovely . " " Well , I think so too . She 's maternal too . Did you see how she took to Bascom ? Gray hair with a young face is attractive . But it 's sad . I 'll bet she 's not thirty yet but she looks kind of depressed . You know what , I think she has had an unhappy life . " Out of loyalty to a confidence Deborah could not say that such was indeed the case . Besides she had gone speechless with anger ; the ignoble well-tailored thin man had limped out on the very heels of Mrs. Cheney . At dusk the train pulled into San Luis Potosi . There would be another twenty-minute stop . Deborah descended to the platform . The diplomats went off just in front of her . They were waging a war about Mexico . He liked Mexico . She detested it . Suddenly a little girl in a white dress ran from a group of top-hatted dark-skinned men and handed the diplomat 's wife a bunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their best company manners received another welcoming delegation like those at Monterrey and Saltillo . Mrs. Bradford hailed the telegraph boy . There was no message , so she sprinted to make inquiry at the office , leaving Bascom with Deborah . The boy ambled on along the tracks moaning " Meesh-ano  --  Meesh-ano . " Lightly as a bird Mrs. Cheney moved up and down the platform . The thin man stood by , idly pulling on a cigarette . Overhead the stars drooped down like misty lanterns which even the station lights could not seriously dim . " Nothing , " Mrs. Bradford said bitterly coming hack . " They say the porter would have got a message for me anyhow . Maybe , maybe not . You never can tell about anything in Mexico . I do n't know what I 'll do . " " Meesh-ano . " " I ca n't go on to Mexico City . I have n't enough money for my ticket . You see , I went shopping last thing and ? " " Meeshano ? " " I beg your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask , " but could that telegram possibly be for you ? " " Is your name Shannon ? " Mrs. Bradford asked surprised . " Why , I saw that wire back in Saltillo . They ought 've put it on the train . Gosh ! " Deborah beckoned the boy . It was indeed her message and she read : " Think Mexico would be swell place for second honeymoon Stop If you agree will leave Newark Wednesday at five arriving Mexico City for lunch at Paulo 's Thursday noon Stop Love Mike " Wednesday was to-morrow . Leave Newark at five . This train got in to Mexico City to-morrow morning . Lots of time . . . . Except that it made no difference . Deborah almost snapped at the boy with her tip . " No answer . " " Bad news ? " inquired Mrs. Bradford . " Awful . " " I hope it 's not a death or anything ? " " Worse . " Deborah dined with Mrs. Cheney who had changed to a becoming black frock . She was now calm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a liqueur . " I was wrong about that man 's being a detective , " she told Deborah . " Manuelo is really wonderful . He sensed my uneasiness and in that note he gave me this afternoon said he 'd some information which he thought might interest me . He told me later that the thin man is John Blaine , who everybody knows owns half the oil in Texas . It 's frightful to be so suspicious . " " It 's not your fault , darling . " " I 'm ashamed of it just the same . Let 's see a lot of each other in Mexico City , shall we ? " " I 'd adore to , " Deborah said warmly . They chatted till after nine o'clock and made a date for breakfast . When Deborah went to the Pullman the berths were all made up save Mrs. Bradford 's . Bascom was asleep on one seat and his mother sat in the other , very forlorn . Her conscience pricking for having left her here alone , Deborah joined her vigil . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Eleven-ten . Finally a quarter to twelve . The porter assembled the bags and brushed Mrs. Bradford 's coat . Deborah gathered the child in her arms . Poor Mrs. Bradford was now so hectic that Deborah begged her to stay on the train if no one met her , offering herself to assume the extra cost . " It would n't be right , " Mrs. Bradford insisted stubbornly . The train began slowing down . The porter lowered the steps . Suddenly a murderous-looking mustachioed Mexican showed up below , holding up a torch . Deborah 's heart quailed at the sight , but Mrs. Bradford cried happily , " Pedro ! " " Pedro , " mumbled Bascom sleepily . " Daddy , " he added as a broad-shouldered , fair-haired man ran up and scooped both woman and child from the steps into his arms . There were no farewells for the forgotten Deborah , for they were still like that when the train moved on under the fabulous stars . What a day ! Deborah reflected , getting into her berth . A living book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom . She slept so soundly that she was late for breakfast . " Life is what you make it , " she heard Mrs. Cheney 's smoky voice asserting as she entered the club car . Opposite her sat the thin man . His eyes were answering that , with his help , Mrs. Cheney could make it pretty nice . " Will you sit here , ma'am ? " Manuelo offered Deborah a little table near the door . He proffered the menu . " Mrs. Cheney , ma'am , says to say she will see you a little later , when ? " " Orange juice and coffee ! " " Yes , ma'am . Thank you , ma'am . " Manuelo , who understood women , went to give the order to the kitchen . On fetching the ice water he even permitted himself a tender smile as he saw the lady take a wedding ring from her purse and put it where it belonged .
