In a little more than two weeks , the Republican Party will gather itself together , go to Philadelphia , make up its mind . That mind was still wandering last week . All that seemed certain was : 1 ) Thomas E. Dewey and Robert Alphonso Taft would go to the convention with more delegates than anyone else ; 2 ) neither would have enough to win on the first ballot . Plentiful were the guesses that a dark horse might romp away with the nomination . The most rambunctious dark horse , getting more rambunctious daily , was Wendell Willkie , onetime Democrat . <P> Willkie followers , mostly amateurs , went around breathing hard , with a hopeful gleam in their eyes . One thing that made them happy was a widespread feeling that the Dewey drive was slowing up . Here &; there delegates openly avowed they would desert Dewey at the first chance . A Gallup Poll , which showed Dewey still far ahead in popular favor ( 56% ) . also showed that he had dropped six points in the last two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Willkie boom : many a crack had been taken at " Toothbrush Tom , " and perhaps voters were getting cold feet about entrusting the threatened future of the U.S. to young Mr. Dewey . <P> Meanwhile , from a standing start in March , when he polled less than a 1% vote among Republican rank &; file , Willkie had risen to 3% in early May ; last week the Gallup Poll gave him 10% . On the strength of the surprising write-in vote ( at last count more than 24,000 ) for Willkie in New Jersey 's primary , observers predicted that Willkie might get the votes of half of New Jersey 's 32 delegates ( pledged to Dewey ) . <P> The Brooklyn Young Republican Club voted 24-to-11 to endorse Willkie in preference to Tom Dewey . In Illinois , Major Aaron K. Stiles ( Stiles Waxt Thread ) , who recently retired as chairman of the Republican State Committee , leaped back as manager of a Willkie campaign . Along Philadelphia 's swank Main Line , rough &; ready Wendell Willkie had become the rage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Works , and head of the Pennsylvania Willkie-for-President Club , declared : " I regard this as a semi-religious movement and we are trying to get it on a revival basis . " A Chestnut Hill lady wrote the Philadelphia Inquirer : " To my way of thinking the Lord has sent us Wendell Willkie . " <P> In Kansas , a somewhat baffled Alf Landon introduced the utilities executive as the " vigorous , energetic and amazing Wendell Willkie . " Said Mr. Willkie to Alf Landon and a Kansas crowd : " I 'm the cockiest fellow you ever saw . If you want to vote for me , fine . If you do n't , go jump in the lake and I 'm still for you . " <P> While Tom Dewey , with bravado , was fumbling with the topic of foreign affairs , while Taft appeared to be running toward the wrong goal posts , Willkie seized the ball , flatly declared : " . . . England and France constitute our first line of defense against Hitler . ... It must therefore be to our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short of declaring war . " It was what many a U. S. citizen believed . <P> Said Columnist David Lawrence , edging out on a limb : " Notwithstanding the opposition of the Republican politicians , the nomination of Wendell Willkie , which was believed impossible a few weeks ago , is decidedly within the realm of a possibility today .
