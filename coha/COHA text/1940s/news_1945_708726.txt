txt Governors of the thirteen Northeastern States will meet Friday in New York City in an effort to avert what was described yesterday by Governor Dewey and by Raymond E. Baldwin , Governor of Connecticut , as a food crisis threatening this section of the country in sixty days . The chief cause of worry is the bottleneck at Buffalo , rail gateway to the whole area , where the transportation tie-up is so great that Midwest and Western farmers are dumping grain that they are unable to send East . According to Governor Dewey this tie-up is costing 1,000 tons of dairy feed daily and soon will affect animal husbandry so adversely that there may be a crisis not only in meat , poultry and eggs but even in milk , which thus far has been plentiful . The rail bottleneck is held due to a shortage of freight cars and manpower and a general transport strain intensified by the redeployment of troops from the European to the Pacific war theatre . The supply shortage is being made worse by maldistribution of several important foods in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He added that New York was the only State in the Union to enforce Federal price control through State action , but that no individual State or even a group of thirteen States could exterminate black markets . One of the aims of the conference , Mr. Dewey said , will be " to see if something can be done to get the Office of Price Administration to do the job nationally . " He // asserted that if local authorities made a vigorous price enforcement drive the black marketeers merely diverted their shipments to another part of the country , where enforcement was lax , thus depriving the public of food in the section that sought to wipe out the black markets . The New York Governor 's assertion brought a quick reply from the OPA in Washington . . " We do have uniform OPA enforcement policies , " George Moncharch , Deputy Administrator for Enforcement , said . " We are delighted , however , that the State Governors are working on the problem of licking the black market . We are hopeful , too , that further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this meeting . " The meeting , to start at 10 A. M. , will be held at Governor Dewey 's suite at the Hotel Roosevelt in this city . Mr. Dewey made the announcement here at the same time that Governor Baldwin announced it at Hartford . Governor Dewey said he had obtained acceptances from Governors Walter E. Edge of New Jersey , Edward Martin of Pennsylvania , Herbert R. O'Conor of Maryland , Walter W. Bacon of Delaware , Colgate W. Darden Jr . of Virginia and Clarence . Meadows of West Virginia . Governor Baldwin , as chairman of the New England Governors ' Conference , lined up Governors Morris A. Hildreth of Maine , Maurice J. Tobin of Massachusetts , Charles M. Dale of New Hampshire , J. Howard of Rhode Island and Mortimer R. Proctor of Vermont for the meeting . The Governors will be . accompanied by their Secretaries of Agriculture and other food experts . Stressing the importance of the rail bottleneck , Governor Dewey said that 60 per cent of all the grain fed to poultry and dairy herds in New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all the feed grain for the New England States enters by the same rail gateway , he added . The conference is intended to bring forth recommendations for easing the rail jam , curbing the black markets and safeguarding the diet of the millions of residents of the Northeast . " We are running within sixty days into a feed crisis for dairy , cattle and poultry that will bring us in three months into a general food crisis , " Governor Dewey said . Declaring that New Yorkers were seldom aware in advance of a food crisis , ( Mr. Dewey asserted that by the time they realized there was a shortage , it was generally too late to do much about it . He said that 85 per cent of the beef eaten by New Yorkers came from west of the Mississippi , as did 70 per cent of the , veal , 95 per cent of the pork and 97 per cent of the lamb and mutton . Mr. Dewey told of a black marketeer visiting an up-State poul-1 try farm and offering to buy 2,0001 chickens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an Albany newspaper offering " roosters for breeding at $3.85 . " These birds , he said , probably were sold as food at 85 cents a pound . The feeling at OPA regional headquarters here was that Mr. Dewey had as much authority and responsibility , under the State War Powers Act , as the OPA in taking action against black markets whose existence he knew or suspected . The only authorized statement , however , was the following , by Daniel P. Woolley , Regional Administrator : " The OPA has been aided very substantially by the enactment of a regulation by the State War Council penalizing violators of OPA regulations . Any further assistance and cooperation by Governor Dewey and other Governors in fighting inflation and eliminating black markets will be appreciated by the OPA . " The New York Board of Trade , after an investigation of black marketing in this city conducted since last March by a committee under the direction of Stanley Kreutzer , petitioned Governor Dewey about ten days ago to appoint a special prosecutor and order an extraordinary term of the Supreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ petition requested also that the matter be laid before the State Legislature at the forthcoming special session and that the Governor integrate the powers of the State with those of each of its municipalities and with the Federal Government to smash the black markets .
