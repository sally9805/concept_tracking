In a former ballroom of Bad Nauheim 's plush Park Hotel , the most shocking Army scandal of World War II reached its climax last week . Grim and flushed , his green eyes squinting belligerently through steel-rimmed glasses , Colonel James A. Kilian , for 26 months commandant of the notorious 10th Reinforcement Depot at Lichfield ( England ) , heard an Army court-martial pronounce its verdict : not guilty of " knowingly " condoning the brutalities practiced in Lichfield 's prison stockade , but guilty of " permitting " them . The sentence : a $500 fine , an official reprimand . <P> This wrist-slap satisfied no one but the Army 's brasshats , who were only too glad to see the whole unsavory mess over &; done with . The prosecution privately argued that the sentence was ludicrously mild . The defense insisted that the court had actually found Defendant Kilian guilty of neglect of duty , a charge not filed against him . Said one sarcastic G.I. spectator : " We 're going to take up a collection to pay the poor guy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Similar cynicism had long echoed in the U.S. among civilians and G.I.s alike . Since the trials of 16 guards and camp officers began last December ( TIME , Dec. 31 et seq. ) , they had listened , appalled , to the grim testimony of former Lichfield prisoners . Men had been beaten there with fists and rifle butts till they were unconscious , then revived and ordered to clean up their own blood . Prisoners who complained of hunger were gorged with three meals at a time , then dosed with castor oil . Hours of calisthenics , of standing " nose and toes " to a guardhouse wall were routine punishments . Purple Heart veterans were deliberately jabbed in their old wounds . There was even a ghastly , sardonic slogan among Lichfield guards : " Shoot a prisoner and be made a sergeant . " <P> In partial justification for Lichfield 's " get-tough " policy , Army apologists had pointed out that many of the prisoners were combat dodgers . At a time when the need for replacements in Europe was critical , the best way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guardhouse so tough that they would prefer the front lines . But many of the 6,000 prisoners who passed through Lichfield 's stockade were minor offenders-AWOLs by only a few hours . <P> Court-Martial the Prosecutor ? The trials were a travesty on justice . Witnesses refused to testify ; there were postponements , delays , finally transfer of the trials from London to Germany . At one point a court-martial president quit in disgust . So did Prosecutor Captain Earl J. Carroll . <P> Last week , with only one junior officer still to be sentenced , the Army seemed ready to close its books on the case . At least two questions remained unanswered . Was the conviction of Kilian just a smokescreen to conceal a policy ordered from above ? How far could a superior officer go in disclaiming the acts of his juniors ? Editorialized the Washington Post : " Generals Yamashita and Homma were convicted . . . . Is the principle of a commander 's responsibility for Japanese only ? " <P> Unperturbed , Colonel Kilian went right on fighting back , started a formal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " his trial .
