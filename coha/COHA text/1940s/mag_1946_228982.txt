Are navies obsolete ? Can a single atomic bomb attack destroy a billion-dollar surface fleet ? Chronically optimistic airmen ( who will drop the bombs ) think so . Brassbound Navymen hold that atomic explosives are just another weapon : they may modify but they will not wipe out their seagoing fortresses and flying fields . This week , top Army &; Navy ordnance men and atomic bombers were down to the i-dotting stage on plans to settle the question . <P> Two tests will be necessary : 1 ) upon a fleet at anchor in shallow water , where divers could go down later to examine the hulls of sunken ships ; 2 ) upon a fleet in deep water . Both are extremely difficult to arrange . In neither case can the ships be manned . The shallow water test must be made where no coastal lands will be affected ; it must be far from important fishing grounds and from ocean currents which might carry radioactive water to populated shores . <P> Clearly indicated was the lagoon of some remote atoll . Likely choices : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the northern Marshalls , or Pokaakku ( Taongi ) between Bikar and Wake . <P> Months of work have gone into the preliminary plans ; more must go into the organization of the great fleet which will include 40 or more sacrifice ships . There is no dearth of expendable craft , from $50,000,000 battleships ( 25 years old ) and even more valuable carriers , to enemy vessels such as the German heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen . <P> So far , there had been a fine show of high-minded cooperation between the services . But no one doubted that the emotional explosion would come after the atomic shock waves had died away . Said the Navy 's No. 1 ordnance man , Vice Admiral W. H. P. ( " Spike " ) Blandy , chairman of the planning committee : " I have no illusions ; there will be controversy later . "
