" This is only Rumor No. 687 , " pooh-poohed Sportswriter Harry Keck of Pittsburgh 's Sun Telegraph last week . But the rumor he was talking about proved well founded . Dr. John Bain ( " Jock " ) Sutherland , famed Pitt football coach , who was dumped into the open market a year ago after a row with Pitt educators , was thereafter rumored engaged almost as often as Brenda Frazier , had actually signed a contract : to coach the Brooklyn Dodgers , National League professional-football club . <P> First top-rank college coach to be taken on by professional football , canny , 50-year-old Jock Sutherland is said to be getting : 1 ) $12,000 a year ( $1,000 less than he received at Pitt ) ; 2 ) promise of a herd of new players ( the Dodgers finished third in the Eastern Division of the league last year ) . Among those he hopes to lure : Iowa 's Ironman Nile Kinnick , No. 1 college footballer of 1939.              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
