Stromy Weather <P> Sir : <P> . . . I do n't see how a magazine with the good reputation that TIME has could picture on its Oct. 11 cover a man who upholds the things Strom Thurmond does . <P> You undoubtedly will say you were trying to please some of your Southern readers . . . <P> LEROY LA FRANCE <P> Danville , Va . <P> <P> Sir : <P> TIME 'S article on Presidential Candidate J. Strom Thurmond is written with the magazine 's usual display of prejudice . . . TIME always seeks to make the South , and Southern leaders , look ridiculous . . . <P> Thurmond has never campaigned on a " white supremacy " platform . He has consistently urged constitutional government of the U.S. , with the 48 components maintaining their sovereign rights . Of course , it makes a more sensational article . . . when you drag in the Negro question-and probably sells more copies in your Northern stronghold where they can continue their criticism of the Southerners for their oppression of the poor blacks . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sir : <P> . . . It would be interesting to note , I believe , how long you and your Negro-loving Yankees would yell for civil rights if they outnumbered you ten to one . <P> T. H. VICKERY JR . <P> Baltimore , Md . <P> <P> Sir : <P> . . . We of the South have not noticed any immediate problem , and neither has the Negro race as a majority . The Negroes are not oppressed , and as a majority are contented . In the larger cities of the " North " the Negro is neglected , kicked about and oppressed regarding housing and employment . . . <P> Yes , we of the South do draw a line . To you Northerners , it may seem closer to the solicitude of the master for his slave . By correction , it is solicitude of the employer for the employee . . . <P> JOHN L. COGBURN JR . <P> Ridge Spring , S.C . <P> <P> Sir : <P> . . . As an American Negro , educated in the North , and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the South , I consider TIME 'S indictment of both North and South as just . . . <P> TIME 'S expos of the yawning chasm which exists between our professions and practices of Christianity and democracy deserves earnest consideration . . . <P> If the white man meets the challenge which TIME has so ably presented , white Americans , in the words of Toynbee . . . " may perhaps be capable of rekindling the cold grey ashes of Christianity . . . until in their hearts the divine fire glows again . It is thus , perhaps , if at all , that Christianity may conceivably become the living faith of a dying civilization for the second time . " For unless the hearts and minds of every one of us have the will to put into action our professions of Christianity and democracy , we will have NO world instead of ONE . <P> FRANK M. SNOWDEN JR . <P> Howard University <P> Washington , D.C. <P> <P> Truman-for-President Dept . <P> Sir : <P> IN SIX AND ONE-QUARTER LINES OF TYPE , YOU HAVE ACHIEVED @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE MOST ERRORS IN THE SMALLEST SPACE . I REFER TO TIME , OCT. 18 , IN WHICH YOU STATE THAT IN A POLL OF 51 MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL PRESS CLUB , PRESIDENT TRUMAN WAS THE ONLY MEMBER TO PREDICT HIS OWN VICTORY . YOU DESCRIBED MR . TRUMAN AS A " LIFETIME " MEMBER OF THE CLUB . . .
