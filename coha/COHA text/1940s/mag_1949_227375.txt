( See Cover ) <P> POINT OF No RETURN ( 559 pp. ) - John P. Marquand- Little , Brown ( $3.50 ) . <P> <P> Charley Gray closed the door of his $30,000 house in Sycamore Park , Conn , and eased himself into the Buick beside his wife . On this rainy spring morning in 1947 , as she did every weekday morning , Nancy was driving him to catch the 8:30 train to his Fifth Avenue bank job in midtown Manhattan . To Charley , this always seemed the friendliest time of the day . He noticed how Nancy 's hair curled below the edges of her green hat and he realized gratefully that he could talk to her about the children , or the household budget , and not be nervous about her driving . <P> This morning , Nancy broke the spell . There was a vice presidency open at Charley 's bank and everyone knew it lay between Charley and Roger Blakesley . The strain of waiting for President Anthony Burton to make up his mind had made Nancy taut . " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she asked . " Are n't you tired of waiting ? " <P> For some reason , Charley Gray became mildly irritated . " The little woman kissing her husband good-by , " he mocked . " Everything depends on this moment . He must get the big job or Junior ca n't go to boarding school . And what about the payments on the new car ? Goodby , darling , and do n't come back to me without being vice president of the trust company . " <P> " Do n't say that , " she said . <P> " Why not ? " Charley asked . <P> " Do n't say it , " Nancy said , her voice louder , " because maybe you 're right . " <P> The story of Charley Gray is the story of millions of decent , middle-class U.S. citizens who are doing well , have a fire in their heels to do still better , and in their thoughtful moments suffer a fugitive feeling of discontentment from start to finish . Charley and Nancy have been to college ; they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Sycamore Park 's second-best country club . All they want at the moment ( besides the vice-presidency ) is a newer car , membership in the Hawthorn Hill Club , prep school for the children and , later , when they can manage it , a rather better house . <P> But for Charley there is an intangible want that none of these things fulfills , even when it can be bought and paid for . Somehow he feels that life is slapping him around , and it makes him dissatisfied and a little bitter . What is missing ? <P> Life Without Props . For almost two years Novelist John Phillips Marquand has been burrowing at the roots of Charley Gray 's discontent . Next week , in his latest and best novel , Point of No Return , he gives his readers no pat answer . But , as a good novelist should , he gives them a shrewd , revealing picture of a broad segment of U.S. society . <P> The Charley Grays burn themselves out in the race to pass the Blakesleys and creep up on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no spiritual props to make life bearable . The question Author Marquand 's book raises is : " Are the rewards of all your efforts worth the effort ? " But Charley Gray himself may be too busy even to hear the issue stated . Like an aircraft pilot who has passed his own point of no return-the point on a long flight where it takes more gas to go back than to go on to his destination-Charley has to keep going .
