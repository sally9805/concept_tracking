txt President Truman expressed the opinion today that business had nothing to fear from his new , four-year administration and offered as evidence his record of the past three and a half years . The President said that there would be no Cabinet changes at this time , all members having been asked to stay and all having agreed . Mr .. Truman would , not commit himself on the practical economics that the country would face in the next year . He told his news conference that they would have to wait for his State of the Union message , his budget message , or his economic message . This was the answer he made when he was asked whether it was true , as Budget Director James E. Webb said today , that Federal spending next year threatened a deficit unless taxes were raised . The Chief Executive added to his answer that he could not tell yet , that he did not have all the figures before him . The President declined to say whether he Would ask for a revival of &modified; form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stated , however , that he would send to Congress the kind of budget he wanted and nothing else . Rayburn 's Statement Recalled In the past Mr. Truman has stood firmly by the position that the budget should be balanced . Consequently there was some speculation that he might seek an increase in taxes to balance outlays . During the last session of Congress the President asked for an excess profits tax to offset the loss of revenues that would result from an individual income tax cut . The excess profits tax proposal was ignored , and the Republicans passed over his veto a much larger cut in taxes than the President wanted . The reassuring words for business came when a reporter recalled that Sam Rayburn , prospective Speaker of the next House , bad said recently that business had nothing to fear from the Truman Administration . Mr. Rayburn expressed this opinion in a news conference while he was a guest of the President at Key West , Fla . Mr. Truman replied to a question about this with a query of his own . He asked whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a half years ? in other words , since he had assumed the Presidency . Mr. Webb expressed his views on the budget in a speech before a meeting of state officials in Detroit . He said that the country faced a deficit when a surplus was needed to curb inflationary pressures , to reduce the national debt and provide a reserve against unpredictable hazards of a world not yet at peace . Webb an Adviser to Truman While Mr. Truman 's reply to the question bearing on the speech was noncommittal , it is known that Mr. Webb is one of his influential advisers . When the question on the excess profits tax came , Mr. Truman would say only that he would attend to it in a message later on . He made a similar reply when he was asked whether the defense budget could be kept under a ceiling of $15,000,000,000 . Earlier in the day , Mr. Truman received an encouraging report , for the time being , on the inflationary situation from his chief economic adviser , Dr. Edwin G. Nourse , chairman of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were " flattening out , they do n't seem to be jumping through the ceiling . " Dr. Nourse said , however , that winter might bring a critical period , and warned that any expenditures for defense above the $15 , - 000,000,000 ceiling set by the Administration , or of the $4,500,000 , - 000 contemplated for the European Recovery Program next year might tip the balance toward another inflationary Dr. Nourse first visited Mr. Truman to present his monthly report on the economic condition of the nation . He returned in the afternoon to preside at a Cabinet coordinating committee meeting which is preparing a new antiinflation program for the President . Dr. Nourse said he had noted a creeping advance of rents , but that " food prices had quite a downturn and are now moving down at a slower rate . " He also said there was " a softening in quite a number of clothing items . " " Does all this add up to a mom encouraging price picture ? " a reporter asked . " I think so , " replied Dr. Nourse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much gratified " with his report " because he is very much concerned " with the price problem . He then issued his warning that any excess of budgetary expenditures might reverse the downward trend , with the possibility of a critical point in the winter months . Dr. Nourse was assigned by the President last week to nead the coordinating committee , whose other permanent members are John Snyder , Secretary of the Treasury ; Charles Brannan , Secretary of Agriculture ; Maurice Tobin , Secretary of Labor ; Charles 1Sawyer , Secretary of Commerce . and Thomas McCabe , chairman of the Federal Reserve Board .
