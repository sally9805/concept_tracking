In Washington no owl hooted in the market place at high noon ; no man 's hand was aflame " like twenty torches join 'd " ; there was no dreadful night of thunder &; lightning , of yawning graves and skittering ghosts ; no two-headed dogs were seen ; no lioness whelped in the street . There were no such signs or portents anywhere . Yet very soon now , on a Monday at high noon , a U. S. President would be inaugurated for a third term-a fact as gravid with significance to the U. S. as Julius Caesar 's fatal Ides of March were to Rome . <P> Even more modern omens were lacking : no bands of feverish citizens swarmed around newsstands to buy papers whose damp headlines hourly leaped higher and blacker ; the radio was dull with soap operas and swing versions of Old Black Joe . On the surface , there was little tension . <P> Yet great doings were afoot . The first major act of the nation 's first third-term President was an act of ominous significance . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved carefully , according to the timetable he keeps , a table whose time is set not by the Naval Observatory , but by public opinion . In a speech to the world he had laid down the broad outline for U. S. action-an outline so broad that it swept with it the almost unanimous support of the country ; in a speech to Congress he had somewhat narrowed his audience but had left the specific method of action still unspecified . Last week he got down to cases . <P> The lend-lease bill he sent to Congress in effect presented a blank check for Congress ' signature . To no U. S. Congress had ever gone such a bill ( see col. 2 ) . No man could read its simple text , sweeping such enormous powers into the hands of the Executive , without seeing at last that the very presentation of such a bill meant that a point in history had been reached , a point of immeasurable gravity . Last week many a U. S. citizen was reminded of the first 100 days of Franklin Roosevelt 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the U. S. ; in 1941 it had widened to the world . <P> Last week the President : <P> &gt; Appointed as his fifth ( of six ) administrative assistants Sherman ( " Shay " ) Minton , 50 , defeated Senator from Indiana . Tall , black-haired , jut-jawed Mr. Minton , a 200% New Dealer , will get $10,000 a year ; will not be used as liaison man with Congress-where his forthright tongue too often rasped colleagues raw . <P> &gt; Set up the Office of Production Management ( see p. 21 ) . <P> &gt; Reorganized the U. S. Fleet into three fleets , appointing a new CINCUS , Rear Admiral Husband E. Kimmel ( see p. 21 ) . <P> &gt; Sent a message recalling the old motto of the First French Republic , " Liberty , Equality , Fraternity , " to Henri Philippe Ptain , Marshal of France , in returning a New Year 's greeting . <P> &gt; Conferred at length with Vice President-elect Henry A. Wallace ; then the Cabinet ; then with five Cabinet members , Defense Chief Knudsen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Representatives Rayburn , McCormack and Bloom , Luther Johnson and Treasury Counsel Edward H. Foley Jr . Subject : new lend-lease bill to aid Britain without limit . <P> &gt; Conferred with Norman Davis , Red Cross chairman , on food to France and Spain ( see p. 19.
