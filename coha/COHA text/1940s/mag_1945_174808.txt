Peru was in a state of electoral grace . Its free election last week , itself a startling novelty , might prove the most significant overturn in Peru 's violent electoral history . Far in the lead , with much of the vote unofficially tabulated , was Dr. Jose Luis Bustamante Rivero , candidate of the National Democratic Front . Snowed under was General Eloy G. Ureta , favored by the Government . <P> Except for transient lapses , Peru had always been governed by a small , tight oligarchy which allowed the people little influence . Elections , when held , were closely controlled . But last week the voters were not intimidated . The Army made no move . There was no significant disorder . Aristocratic President Manuel Prado strolled through the streets of Lima , almost unescorted , to cast his vote amid the cheers of the populace . <P> Bustamante 's Democratic Front was a coalition of many elements , including some conservatives . But strong within it was the long-outlawed Apra Party ( Apristas ) , * which appeals to the Indian masses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be a new deal for the Indians . General Ureta 's defeat would be excellent news for Chile , Colombia and Ecuador , which have long worried about the aggressive designs of the bumptious Peruvian Army . <P> It was not entirely certain as yet that Bustamante 's victory at the polls would actually make him President . In 1936 , Congress voided a somewhat similar election won by the Apristas . <P> <P> * Now officially called Partido del Pueblo .
