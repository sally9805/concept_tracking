These four advertisements about advertising ( and two others ) have now appeared in 41 million copies of TIME , LIFE and FORTUNE . Those of you who read my Aug. 29 Letter will recall that I said we were running them to give as many people as possible more information about the way advertising works in the public interest . They presented six typical ways in which advertising helps to " create the demand that boosts the production that lowers the cost . " <P> The response to this campaign from TIME Inc. readers all over the U.S. has , with a few exceptions , been enthusiastic , constructive , and very rewarding . Many readers took the time to write long , thoughtful treatises on the campaign itself and on their views of advertising 's role in the U.S. economy . There were hundreds of requests for reprints of the advertisements-from manufacturers who wanted to display them on employee bulletin boards ; from schools , colleges , art teachers , professors of history , journalism , advertising , marketing , etc. , for use in classrooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them on to friends. * The Canadian Association of Advertising Agencies has also asked ( and been given ) permission to reprint the series in Canada . <P> Some of our readers criticized the campaign-mostly for not doing more than it did . A few said that they had no use for advertising anyway , and there was an occasional reply like this one : " . . . The art work is arresting . <P> <P> The double trucks are impressive . But if all national advertising copy had been as dull , boring and obtuse as in your series , the great American mass production machine would have ground to a halt long ago . " <P> Other readers of a less dour turn of mind thought that the campaign was a first-rate contribution and should be continued indefinitely . They even suggested subjects for future series of advertisements ( e.g. , recreation : to show how advertising has helped the mass production of movies , sporting goods , etc . ) . Still another wrote as follows : " Your series is well directed toward making economic points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highlighting the peculiarly democratic political contribution of advertising . You could have shown that but for advertisers there would be no free press . . . On this score it would have been interesting to show , by page spreads from newspapers and magazines of opposite political orientation , the range of diversity possible in a free advertising-supported press . " <P> One of our hopes in presenting this series was that other publications would devise further campaigns in advertising 's behalf . For without the swift exchange of goods and news about those goods our economy would grind to a halt . It was to the wider understanding of that basic truth that TIME Inc. ' s " Campaign About Advertising " was directed . <P> Cordially yours , <P> <P> *While the supply of reprints lasts , all requests for them are being filled .
