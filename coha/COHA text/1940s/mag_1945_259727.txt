Most war-weary British veterans , dribbling back into civilian life that is still rigorously rationed and restricted , long for the cozily lighted window that means the unrestricted freedom and comfort of home . Through that lighted window John Boynton Priestley has tossed a well-aimed literary brick . Novelist Priestley ( The Good Companions ; Angel Pavement ) is one of British Labor 's most popular literary backers . In a brief ( 32-page ) , brusque , best-selling pamphlet entitled Letter to a Returning Serviceman , Priestley beseeches ex-Tommies to beware of their heart 's desire- " the charmed cozy circle " of home life . <P> " There is n't much time . . . . Do n't , I implore you , sink too deep , too far , into that famous English privacy . . . . Fleet the time carelessly in your slippers and armchair . . . go off with the girl and enjoy the loneliest possible holiday . . . . But when you come back , be a real citizen and not a hermit in a bungalow . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely watching it stream past . . . . I declare to you that I would rather see this whole island turned inside out and upside down every ten years , with whole cities pulled down and rebuilt as if they came out of a child 's box of bricks , than I would see these grand folks of ours sinking into apathy again , lulled by the murmurs of fools and rogues . " <P> Priestley ( who has just returned from Moscow , where his new play , An Inspector Calls , is running in two theaters simultaneously ) plainly tells whom he considers fools and rogues . They are " the tough fellows behind the huge . . . cartels , " the " Lords Midas " of the press , " literary ladies and gents who adore peasants , " " the aesthete with his private income . . . bloodless and shrinking . " Veterans are also plainly told that in eschewing hominess they must stand four-square behind state-planned economy ( " . . . I do not believe in economic liberty . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Priestley-now less &; less a novelist , and more &; more a pamphleteer-also admits that he sheds no tears for individual enterprise . " Modern man is essentially a communal and cooperating man . . . . We have no Leonardo da Vinci or Shakespeare . But we accomplish what would seem miracles to our forefathers ... by our new pooling of knowledge and our superb teamwork . When the American O.W.I. . . . showed us the film they had made about TVA . . . I felt as deeply moved as I would have been by a noble work of art . " <P> To Tommies who might find his program drab . Author Priestley offers an unexpected inducement-a jihad against bluenoses : " I should like to see the English , once they had done their share of the community 's work , doing what they damned well pleased ; and refusing once and for all to be bullied by highly organised little gangs of teetotallers , Sabbatarians , and all the unloved and the life-haters . The chief freedom the English people need now is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feelings of sour-faced old women and envious old men . "
