txt The United States and Mexico have concocted an International public works program to install all the latest improvements along the Mexican border . On a schedule drawn up by Boundary Commissioners Lawrence Lawson of the U. S. and Rafael Fernandez of Mexico are four kinds of developments : Dams for flood control . water storage and irrigation . Levees . canals and river-bed straightening for direct control of the Rio Grande . Sanitation plants at twin border tbwns . . ? Fences along . the land border to keep meandering cattle from haphazardly changing nationalities . Each of the two countries Is to chip in toward the cost . First instalment for the United States would be $13,072.000 , for the fiscal year beginning July . The U. S. bill eventually would run above $127 million , not counting the $41 million Davis Dam on the Colorado River , an exclusively United States project but tied in with the border plan . Mexico 's total share of the bill has not been worked out yet. * Three Dams for $53 Million Three of the border dams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexico which the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee recently approved by an 6-4 ' vote . These dams will cost the U. S. S7.3 million the first year . $53 million by the time they 're finished . Mexico 's contribution will be $33 million altogether . One dam will be a " concrete - gravity bon , " 450 feet high , near Dryden . Texas . The concrete wall-like structure , built to slant against the flow of the Rio Grande . will flood little valley and store up a maximum of 5 million acre feet of water  --  an acre foot being sufficient water to cover an acre of land one foot deep . The second dam would he earth-filled , 150 feet high , with storage capacity of 3 million acre feet , located 40 miles upstream from Laredo . Texas . Seventy miles below Laredo , the third dam would be another earth-filled structure 150 feet high , capable of storing 2.5 million acre feet . Waters that now go to waste into the Gulf of Mexico would be stored in the three dams , increasing the irrigated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . Treaty Guarantees Water Supply Along with this construction , under ' the treaty , is a guarantee by the U. S. to supply Mexico with 1.5 million acre feet of water annually from the Colorado River . which forms 20 miles of the Mexican border . Mexico in turn guarantees that . Mexican tributaries will supply 350,000 acre feet of water annually to the Rio Grande . Another 5109.000 is to he supplied next year by the United States , under the treaty . for the $7 million Marron Dam project near San Diego . which would store water from the Tijuana River which now is wasted in the Pacific Ocean . A special agreemlnt in addition to the treaty will be required before this can be carried out , however . Not required by the treaty , but mentioned in it , is the Davis Dam , to be built 60 miles below Boulder Dam on the Colorado river . It would hold some of the waters released by Boulder Dam to facilitate their use for power . Another agency , the Bureau of Reclamation , Is charged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a $62.5 million project calling for a series of earth dams and canals on the Rio Grande . They would provide new irrigation for 165,000 acres of land and additional water for 550,000 acres already irrigated . To take 80 months for completion , the project needs $3 million from the U. S. next year . Mood control is the purpose of the Sentinel Dam which would be built on the Gila River . Studies on needed capacity would cost the U. S. $100,000 next year . Disciplining the Rio Grande An awkwasd habit of changing its course calls for some special control projects on the Rio Grande . The Boundary Commission in4ts 56-year career has determined the nationality of 48.000 awes of land over which the river has shifted . One plan for disciplining the river was a $16 million project , completed in 1938 , to straighten its course , thus quickening its flow and avoiding stagnation in dry spells . About $500.000 in improvements is needed . and the Commission has asked the Budget Bureau for 5150,000 for the first year 's work . The Commission also wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexico to El Paso , begun in 1938 and halted by the war , and $e2 million for flood control work on the lower Rio Grande , where $8 million of construction is already completed and only $2 million more is needed to finish the job . Mexico pays for the works on her aide of the river . Erosion along certain Rio Grande bends threatens Government-built levees and pumping plants that furnish irrigation water . Bank protection works are needed , and the Commission seeks 5260.000 next year of the $850,000 total.cost . All construction would be on the U. ' S. side of the Rio Grande . so this country would foot the entire bill . Another flood control measure sought is a closed water conduit made of concrete . 20 feet wide , 10 feet high and two miles long . It would be built on the border at Nogales , half in Mexico and half in the U. S. Mexico would pay $300,000 and the U. S .. $500,000 , with $180,000 of it next year for a starter . Sewage Plants for Twin Towns Two joint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towns of Douglas , Arizona , and Agua Prleta , State of SOnora , the other for Nogales . Arizona . and Nogales . Mexico . Cost will be shared according to the populations of the towns . The Douglas plant would cost $92,000 , with the U. S. paying SOT.r , Mexico 20% . Nogales and Nogales are the same size . however . so each country would pay half of the $400,000 for their sanitation plant . Finally , there are fences for the 675 miles of land border . Cattle wander back and forth . confusing their nationality and raising the blood pressure of health officials . About 300 miles of fence are under construction In one project , where adjacent lands are used for grazing . To complete this project next year . the Commission wants $190.000 . The other program would fence the border from Del Rio , Texan , to Brownsville , Texas , at an estimated cost of $400,000 . The Commission has asked $100.000 for next year .
