txt Instead of extending Selective Service , Congress ought to provide at once for a large permanent professional Army . Selective Service is not selective enough . It is years since deferments were granted for undergraduate college training , and continuation of this interruption will cripple more and more our science , engineering and future military power . The public is confused by official recommendation of two separate drafts . The adoption of the second one , permanent universal military training , " conscription for training , not for service , " would aggravate in the armies of occupation the threatened manpower shortage . What kind of planning has the War Department given us ? We send our children to fraternize with the Germans and Japanese , while regular officers , a lifetime in service , receive their customary award for a hard-won victory  --  namely , demotion . Representatives of the War Department say that a large " mercenary " Army would not be in accordance with American tradition . Congress , and not a department , had better be the judge of that . Armies are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be . A modern army requires the services of experts and workers of practically every sort , and therefore is unlikely to be narrowly military in spirit . A large part of , the activities of the Army service forces in the United States ought to be carried out by men and women not in uniform . This further reduces the supposed threat to the Republic of an adequate standing Army . Even in wartime a vast deal of energy and material was wasted in useless military training and equipping of civilians whose services were of a nature not requiring a uniform . An adequate professional United States Army would serve to discourage aggressors more effectively than a vague reserve of quarter-trained exdraftees . Mobilization of civilians always is politically uncertain , and an aggressor would hope to strike and win before such a reserve could be made effective . Let us have adequate discussion of the pros and cons of the case for a large Regular Army plus a sufficient number of civilian workers in Ordnance , Signal Corps , etc . Army officers should be permitted by the War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of them undoubtedly prefer an adequate standing Army to the universal training plan . Let the country be prepared to give the regular establishments , Army and Navy , such support and respect as hitherto have not been dreamed of in peacetime . This will not make us into Germans overnight . Their work will be intricate and interesting , their responsibilities heavy . The Army 's present advertising campaign for volunteer enlistments is all very well so far as it goes , but it presents an appeal only to relatively superficial and ephemeral motives of recruits . The Army ought to be for all ranks a high career , not a mere incident . There are noble objectives of a peaceful sort which an adequate Regular Army can achieve now that military technology is far advanced . JOHN Q. STEWART . Princeton , N. J. , March 29 , 1946 . Promotions in City Service To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Your recent editorial " The Captain and His Broom " was interesting , especially the last line , " * * but we can use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many of the returned veterans in civil service have acquired new skills while in the Army . I have yet to see the city take advantage of these new skills , although this would be in line with the report of the Citizens Budget Commission on " Personnel Waste , " in which is recommended a new personnel set-up . The report mentions promotions for city employes . At present promotional opportunities are limited to the department in which the employe works . Let promotions be opened on a city-wide basis for categories such as clerk , stenographer , accountant , etc. , positions which are applicable to any city department and in which the work could be learned in a probation period . I believe this system would result in having the best qualified employes eventually holding the top civil service positions . ADOLPH W. MCCOOK Ozone Park , L. Mvch 27 , 1946 . Withholding Tax Favored To THE EDITOR OF THE New YORK TIMES : It is to be hoped that if Congress takes George Stafford 's advice , as expressed in a letter in THE NEW YORK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a view to lightening the burden of the small taxpayer , it will be more careful than Mr. Stafford in citing figures . A married man , with two dependent children , earning $40 a week pays no income tax at all , according to the tax deduction tables . Deductions for such a man begin with $43 a week , when 10 cents is taken out . On the whole , it is easier for the average wage-earner to have no income tax to worry about when March 15 comes around . HARRY T. SMITH . Hollis , N. Y. , March 28 , 1946 . To THE EDITOR OF THE New YORK Taos : The Missouri State Council of the Knights of Columbus have a right to their opinion and to its expression . But when they give such public expression as that in the recently published newspaper advertisements they must certainly expect public disagreement . Passing over the extensive attempt to whitewasheSpain , I single out one sentence which is so shocking as to vitiate the whole position advocated in the argument . Two-thirds of the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spain , deserted by her friends and attacked by the enemies of humanity , should fall before the Red Fascists , the last outpost of Christian civilization in Europe will be gone . " Certainly that is a most amazing sentence . Is Spain the last outpost of Christian civilization in Europe ? I had supposed that Britain , Sweden , Norway , Denmark , Holland , etc. , not to mention Italy itself , were in Europe . But while it is amazing to call Franco Spain " the last outpost of Christian civilization " it is repulsively shocking to have it held up as in any way representing Christian civilization . In the same week in which this advertisement was written a book called " Wind in the Olive Trees " was published . The author , Abel Plenn , was formerly chief of propaganda analysis in the American Embassy in Spain . Certainly his authority is unquestionable . In that book I find among others these quotations : " It was the custom , established since the first anniversary in 1937 , when the war was still going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ? nearly all political prisoners were ' Reds ' ? on every anniversary of the uprising . This particular custom , I soon discovered , was more honored in the observance than the breach , and to such a degree , that it had been extended in every city and town throughout Spain where political prisoners were being held , to include not only all the Nationalist anniversaries such as the birth of Franco and the elevation of Franco as Chief of State , but also the many official religious holidays of which Christmas , the Feast of the Conception , Corpus Christi and Easter were only a few . " Christian civilization indeed ! And what of this : " With the return and even enhancement of its former power , the Spanish Church had launched a campaign of extermination against all forms of religious ' heresy . ' This meant chiefly Protestantism and Masonry . * * " Although there were only about 30 , - 000 Protestants in all Spain , representing less than one-eighth of 1 per cent of the country 's predominantly Catholic population of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a serious threat . Under Franco , Spain had again become Catholic Spain by decree , and throughout the country Protestants were identified with Masonary and anti-clericalism and were persecuted relentlessly . " Everywhere I went I encountered cases of fanatical persecution of Spanish Protestants . * * " From other Spanish acquaintances and friends , who were Protestants ? mostly Methodists  --  I heard of numerous instances of bruital intolerence , discrimination and persecution practiced against Protestant ministers and congregations by police and other officials at the behest of Catholic authorities " And what of the established fact that Franco Spain was boastfully the active ally of Adolph Hitler and Benito Mussolini ? The Missouri Knights of Columbus may be entitled to their political attitude toward Spain , but surely they are not entitled to such sacrilige as to hold up this bloody tyranny as an example of Christian civilization .

In addition to the facts mentioned in your editorial , ceiling prices imposed on coffee in 1941 are below the average price for that commodity during the last thirty years . If those prices were increased by 5 cents it would mean to the American coffee consumer a difference of efs of a cent a cup , but to the all-time American producer it would mean the difference between prosperity and starvation .
