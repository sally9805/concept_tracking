This week the sovereign State of Missouri will set aside a day to honor a plump , loquacious spinster , Mary Margaret McBride , ex-citizen of Paris , Mo . Miss McBride , whose previous citations include an award from the Wall Paper Institute , has distinguished herself throughout the land as the most-listened-to female heart-to-hearter . Since 1934 , under her own name and the pseudonym Martha Deane , she has babbled furiously about friends , featherbeds , food , life in Missouri , New York and Europe . Until a couple of months ago , she was heard over both CBS and the MBS station WOR , serving Columbia as Mary Margaret McBride , WOR as Martha Deane . In her dual role she made somewhere between $50,000 and $100,000 a year . Now she functions only for CBS , and a new Martha Deane has taken over her spot on WOR . Her five-a-week , 15-minute show is strictly ad lib . <P> When Miss McBride fluttered into radio , she had behind her an impressive career as a sob sister . A graduate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked on the Ledger in Mexico , Mo. , the Cleveland Press , the late New York Evening Mail . She had done work for the Interchurch World Movement , turned out articles for the Saturday Evening Post , collaborated with Prince Christopher of Greece on the history of his family . Back in the creative groove again , she has just turned out a book on her childhood called How Dear to My Heart . <P> Startling to many a sponsor were Miss McBride 's broadcasts for WOR . Tooling along at a great verbal clip for 45 minutes , she frequently forgot which products she had plugged , usually wound up her show by asking her announcer if there was anything she 'd overlooked . When sponsors complained about her methods , she told her listeners all about it , brought a deluge of letters to support her . Eager to prevent even " one teeny white lie " from , slipping into her program , she once spent an entire Sunday touring picnic grounds to discover how picnickers enjoyed a soft drink she was plugging , advised her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the stuff in any lunch basket she had examined . To offset such commercial gaucheries , Miss McBride made a point of eating products while discussing them on the air on the theory that she could better describe their goodness while actually going to work on them . This did not help her to reduce . Sponsored now by the Florida Citrus Commission , she serves grapefruit in the studio , spoons some herself whenever the spirit moves her . <P> Besides chitchat about her comings &goings,; Miss McBride includes on her programs discussions of art exhibits , flower shows , factories in operation , etc. , changes pace by interviewing visiting celebrities . Helping her gather her material now are two researchers , who do preliminary leg work which Miss McBride follows up after she reads their reports . Only written material she uses on the air are a few scribbled notes on a sheet of yellow paper . In her six years on the air , she has received over a million letters . Folksiest broadcast she ever made involved her redheaded nephew on the occasion of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to convince her listeners that he was really there , kept murmuring , " Say ' Goo , ' baby , say ' Goo . ' " After listening to Miss McBride for almost 45 minutes , the baby finally gave in . " Goo , " he said .
