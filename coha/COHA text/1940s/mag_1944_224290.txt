Among other things , a question of money last week disturbed Charles de Gaulle 's always tempestuous relations with Washington and London . <P> The Allied Command had taken " military money " into France-franc notes backed by nothing except the noncommittal printing on the currency ( TIME , June 19 ) . But to the Gaullists , the main issue was not the currency itself , however dubious its worth . It was simply that no U.S. or British authority had any business floating currency in France . That , said the Gaullists , was solely the function of Frenchmen . When the Allied command supplied its soldiers with non-French " francs , " the whole principle of French sovereignty was imperiled . <P> Three Players . In the ensuing uproar , the triangular state of U.S.-British-Gaul-list relations became more apparent than ever . London newsmen heard that Winston Churchill was astounded when he heard of the arrangement for fiat invasion currency , was far from satisfied with the explanations given him . President Roosevelt indirectly confirmed the impression that the U.S. had fathered the plan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He added that they had not approved the plan , but had not rejected it , either . Evidently , in this as in other aspects of the French imbroglio , Britain had reluctantly followed the U.S. lead while the French stood off in a corner . <P> Growing awareness of this fact made the British more &; more uncomfortable . The House of Commons impatiently demanded a debate on French policy , forced Winston Churchill to put the blame on his great friend in Washington . Said Churchill : " We have to consider our very close relations with the United States and its relations with the French body . " <P> Double Play ? General de Gaulle had antagonized practically everybody , including some of his own associates , with his arbitrary behavior in London . But his posturings and demands had not improved the U.S. position . Said the shrewd London Economist : " . . . allowing for the worst the President can suspect , the present American attitude is calculated to bring about exactly those dangers which it is designed to prevent . " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Algiers . He and his associates seemed pleased with themselves , talked confidently of impending gains for the Gaullists . London expected negotiations to begin immediately between the British Government and the Gaullist Government for some new and broadened form of recognition. * Out of all this loomed a possible solution : Britain would give De Gaulle 's Government the kind of realistic recognition it wanted ; the U.S. would then accept an accomplished fact and climb aboard the bandwagon . <P> * Last week the governments of Czechoslovakia , Poland , Belgium , Luxembourg and Yugoslavia recognized the French Liberation Committee as a Provisional Government . This recognition gave General de Gaulle one more argument in his ceaseless demand for complete Big Power recognition
