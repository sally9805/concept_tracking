Since NRA 's famous Section 7(a) was written , many a U. S. employer has had his first experience bargaining ( or wrangling ) with a labor union over wages , hours , the closed shop . This week some Manhattan businessmen confronted a union contract that involved none of these things . It is such a remarkable contract that when &; if it is signed , a new era in U. S. labor relations will be formally opened . <P> Potent I.L.G.W.U. 's Dress Joint Board ( 85,000 members ) has had a closed-shop , industry-wide agreement since 1933 with Manhattan 's 2,100-odd dress manufacturing shops , who make nearly 75% of U. S. dresses . Last December the union and five trade associations began negotiating a new contract to replace one signed in 1939 . To the council table went the D. J. B. 's top man , husky , dimple-chinned Julius Hochman , with a surprise he had been hatching for months in his iron-grey head . <P> Instead of demanding more pay or shorter hours , Hochman merely asked the manufacturers to do two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business more efficiently and make more money . Hochman 's theory : the union already had a 35-hour week and adequate pay minimums ; how well its members prospered in the future depended on how well their industry fared . <P> Efficiency has never been the dress industry 's long suit . For years it flourished in a seller 's market ; it still inhabits an economic Bohemia where success often depends 50% on talent in designing , 49% on luck and 1% on managerial skill . A shop can be started on a corset string ; given a loft and a few cheap machines , anybody can try it . Although dressmaking is Manhattan 's biggest manufacturing industry ( $349,482,204 in 1939 ) , its units are pygmies : only 60 firms gross as much as $1,000,000 annually . Some 22% of the companies fail and are replaced by newcomers each year . <P> Pointing to these facts &; figures , Hochman told the manufacturers bluntly that the union was sick of the waste and inefficiency they tolerated . Workers ( paid piece rates ) sat around idly waiting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incompetent foremen to route work to them . Until merchandising was improved , U. S. women would continue to spend less for dresses than for stockings and underwear ( average annual purchase : two street dresses ) . What Hochman wanted was busy plants , busy workmen , manufacturers who understood cost accounting , kept overhead down , prospered . <P> As steps toward his goal , Hochman had three concrete ideas : 1 ) a $1,500,000-a- year promotion fund ( the union offered to contribute , $100,000 ) to plug dresses and Manhattan 's claim to Paris ' old title of world 's fashion centre ; 2 ) establishment of a school of management , staffed by experts who would teach the manufacturers how to operate without waste ; 3 ) an " efficiency clause " giving the union the right to demand good ' management and penalizing employers , who failed to provide it .
