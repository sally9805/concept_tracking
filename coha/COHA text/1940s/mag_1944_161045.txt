A whooping-cough epidemic in 1908 quarantined Baltimore school children at home . The faculty of Calvert School mailed lessons to its whoopers , later developed a Home Instruction Division for grades from kindergarten to first year high school . Thanks to this necessity-mothered beginning , children can get a standard U.S. education anywhere the U.S. mails can reach . <P> Calvert School today has some 300 day pupils . Its unique service goes to 3,000 shut-in or isolated children in all of the 48 states and such odd spots as Poona , Ruanda-Urundi , Juneau , Waialua , Horta , Haiti . It is constantly expanding : last week Calvert was taking on U.S. children who will study as a group in Nicaragua 's torrid Managua . <P> For $55 a year ( except for the preprimary and postgraduate years ) , Calvert provides a teaching manual , textbooks , tests , charts , maps , scrapbook , pads , pencils , ruler and other materials . For an additional $16 the pupil may send work in for criticism by regular Calvert teachers . The school gives certificates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Learn at Home . Calvert home courses concede nothing to slowpokes . In two to four hours a day , 160 lessons a year , parents can put children through eight elementary grades in six years . Parents get their teacher-training from Calvert manuals , which are almost parent-proof . Though some find pedagogy tough going , most of their pupils do very well . Mothers with kindergarten children get instructions on how to teach , play games , punish , tell stories , test intelligence , deal with lefthandedness , lying , disobedience , sex problems , how to develop morals , neatness , courtesy , concentration , imagination . Sample instruction : " Obedience ... is the first requisite for ... proper instruction . . . the first habit to be inculcated . . . . Both willingness and ability to obey may be made a habit . . . the child should never be allowed to argue , dispute or question orders . . . . Say ' I want to see if you can do what I tell you , instantly , when I tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then give the order : ' Stand up . . . . ' " A Calvert specialty is the Royalroad Course , somewhere between kindergarten and first grade . It covers the 3Rs unadorned , gives the child elementary equipment needed to do first-year work without delays . The first year includes subjects which most schools put off until later : history ( famous stories , biographies , national holidays ) , nature study , picture study ( famous paintings ) . Second-year pupils get geography , science ( animals without backbones ) . In the fifth year comes physics out of a text ( What Makes the Wheels Go Round ) by a Calvert teacher , Lieut . Colonel Edward G. Huey , who is now in England . <P> Learn in Asia . Calvert methods are a mixture of many traditions . Earnest , friendly Headmaster Edward Woodman Brown ( Princeton ' 23 ) is no " progressive " educator . A tall and talented tennist , he looks older than his 42 years . He stresses discipline and English composition in a special Calvert up- &-down; script . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for U.S. children in crowded Jap concentration camps like that in Shantung 's Wei-hsien . The Calvert method was used there for six months by Rochester 's Mrs. Frederick G. Scovel , wife of a medical missionary . Repatriated on the Gripsholm last winter , she wrote :
