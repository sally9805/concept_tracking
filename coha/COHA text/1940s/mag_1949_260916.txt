From crumbling Shanghai , TIME Correspondent Robert Doyle cabled : <P> <P> Two miles from the Communist front lines southwest of Shanghai , in the city 's smartest residential section , a fresh-faced young Chinese officer stood before a bluff , hearty Englishwoman . Behind him stood several soldiers , holding baskets of wood shavings . They had come to burn down Mrs. Gladys Hawkings ' house because it was " in the line of fire . " Said firm , 58-year-old Mrs. Hawkings : " Young man , I was living in this house before you were born . This is my home and I intend to stay . " <P> The young officer grinned and relented . On a map which showed the houses to be demolished he drew a small circle around the Hawkings place ; the little bit of Britain stubbornly holding out against China 's civil war was safe again , for the moment . <P> " We Ca n't Have This . " A week before , Shanghai 's Nationalist commander had warned the Hawkingses and other foreigners that their lives would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defenses . Most foreigners withdrew , but Mrs. Hawkings , sometime of Winterbourne , Kingston , Dorset , and her husband William , who is general manager of a Shanghai shipping firm , did not budge . <P> The 15-room Hawkings home ( called " The Limit , " because it is the last house on Shanghai 's southwestern boundary ) at once became a front-line position . Nationalist soldiers pulled down fences all around , dug trenches through neighboring gardens , put neighboring houses to the torch . When one group of soldiers started to chop down Mrs. Hawkings ' trees , she told them : " We 've lived in this house for 27 years and brought up five daughters here , and we ca n't have this sort of thing going on . " The soldiers , overwhelmed by her bearing and her perfect Chinese , obediently put away their hatchets . <P> " I managed to stop them from building a gun post in the middle of the bowling green , by showing them a much better strategic position , " said Mrs. Hawkings , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weigela and nemophila from being dug up for a trench , by showing them how to take better shelter down by the lily pond . I got them so sympathetic for my garden that they even held the flowers apart so they could thread barbed wire without breaking the blooms . " <P> " Bit of Bad Luck . " When the Communists started their drive up from the southwest , Gladys Hawkings opened the big red doors of her walled compound and let in scores of refugees . <P> <P> One morning , after the fighting had eddied around the house for several hours , a shell hit the compound and wounded six Nationalist soldiers who had moved into the garden house . <P> " Bit of bad luck , you know , " said Mr. Hawkings , a trim man in grey flannels . " Yes , " agreed Mrs. Hawkings , " things were a bit tight last night . For the first time in my life I slept with my shoes on .
