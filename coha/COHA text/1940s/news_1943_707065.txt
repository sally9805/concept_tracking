txt Golf Course Idea Rejected One of your readers recently suggested that patrons of the public golf courses should help keep them in proper condition this Summer , if a manpower shortage developed within the ranks of the city Park Department . Undoubtedly he is sincere and his idea , as I recall it , did have some merit , but I do not know how feasible it would be to have 100 or 200 golfers doing work of that nature without proper supervision . And even then the task of directing a throng , of voluntary workers might exhaust an experienced foreman 's patience , not to mention the damage that might be done to the greens and fairways by well-meaning but untrained helpers . When the city finds it impossible to keep these courses open because of a lack of manpower , I think they should be closed immediately . That would be the most practicable and most economical solution of the problem . GEORGE GRADY . New York , March 27 , 1943.             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
