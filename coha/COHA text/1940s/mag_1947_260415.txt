When Congress chopped the frayed mooring cable of OPA a year ago , there was a good deal of screeching around the big balloon of the U.S. economy . Harry Truman had already tossed out the ballast of wage controls . The cable was about to part anyhow . The first flight without controls soon made even 1940 prices look like something out of great-grandmother 's album of souvenirs . <P> Nevertheless , there was general optimism then . The basis for it was the belief that the balloon would soon level off and that it would finally land , on higher ground than it had rested on before the war , but in a stable position nevertheless . But last week , despite all sorts of order-shouting and lever-jerking , prices were still going up like the balloon that carried Aeronaut Ira Thurston out over Lake Erie in 1858 ( see cut ) . <P> In the past few months there had been nothing particularly spectacular about the day-by-day progress of the ascent . But the cumulative effect was beginning to make a half-dollar look like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By June 15 the cost of living was 58.5% higher than in the period from 1935-39 . ( The post-World War I rise reached a peak of 105.2% above 1914 prices . ) Clothing had risen 101.6% ; food , 96.1% ; house furnishings , 78% ; fuel 19.5% . <P> Bacon : 85 . There was no letup as the summer wore on . In Chicago , eggs were up from 57 ( in June ) to 65 a dozen ; in St. Louis , butter had crept from 77 to 83 a pound ; in Milwaukee a pound of round steak had jumped from 73 in June to 83 ; in San Francisco , a pound of sliced bacon from 75 to 85 . Many tenants had just gotten a bill for 15% increase in rent . <P> Beneath the surface of such miscellaneous increases at consumer outlets there were more basic disturbances : price rises in both coal and steel , and an increase in the price of General Motors automobiles ( see BUSINESS ) . <P> The country was also being visited by a plague of annoying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price of all kinds of small goods and services . Restaurant prices were developing a habit of rising as much as 10 to 50 overnight . Some radio repairmen were charging more to peer into a receiving set than a physician asked for a sick call . It even cost more to go broke-the fee for filing bankruptcy papers in U.S. district courts went up from $30 to $45 . <P> What Next ? Clutching his billfold , the average consumer wondered where it would all end . He had more money to spend than ever before ; wages had gone up , and that was one of the basic explanations of high prices . But the consumer also harbored a suspicion that many a price this summer would be boosted by vendors who were just out to get what they could while the getting was good . <P> Economists assured him that , barring the possibility of wholesale strikes , things would be all right , that there might be a little recession first , but it was not likely to turn into a real crash . <P> The average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he was able , try to enjoy the ride , and hope fervently for the best . But he was beginning to feel more &; more like poor Mr. Thurston.
