Chicagoans popped their eyes and bought copies of Hearst 's Her aid-American like small boys going after hot cakes . What attracted their nose for sensational " news " was a running story compounded of such sure-fire elements as a " suitcase baby " and a vanished blonde . It promised " clues and discoveries and cruel twists of fate in Millard Bender 's 50,000-mile , $25,000 , seven-month search for his loved ones . . . . " <P> To make way for it , Hearst 's hustlebustle evening Herald-American last week dumped a " goofball " ( sleeping pill ) expose it had been running for weeks . As the new series developed , opposition editors sighed ; baby-faced Harry Reutlinger , city editor of the Herald-American , was turning his journalistic cartwheels again . They had given up hoping he would fall on his face ; but they still marveled at the razzle-dazzle that has pushed his paper ( circ. 562,000 ) out in front of the competing Times and Jack Knight 's Daily News . <P> Bell-Ringer . One of the best city editors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a dozen years , while a dozen managing editors have come &; gone . ( His standard , deadpan approach to a new Hearst-appointed managing editor : " If you do n't want me to work for you , just let me know and I 'll make other arrangements . " He never has to . ) Hearst accountants may wince at the long-distance tolls he runs up , but he rings up scoops that way . By casual telephone calls , he got beats on the Dionne quintuplets ' birth ( it came over the wires as a one-paragraph item ; he telephoned Dr. Dafoe for the details ) , and Douglas Corrijan 's wrong-way flight ( Reutlinger placed phone calls to three airports in Ireland , sure that Corrigan would come down there ) . <P> When chubby Harry Reutlinger was a high-school boy , ushering in a North Side Chicago theater , a movie called Net of the News decided him on his career . The old Evening American took him on as a copy boy , and in ten years of beat-covering he learned his home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city desk , he was an authority on the city 's clergymen and its bookies , its main streets and back alleys . As a young sports writer , he uncovered the 1919 Black Sox scandal , later got a scoop on the Lindbergh kidnaping ransom note . Unlike the city editors of fiction , he is full of sweet ' reasonableness with his admiring staff of " Reutlinger 's Rats . " <P> Howdy , Chief . Reutlinger thinks nothing of telephoning across town-or across the world-and posing as the coroner , the Governor or a Cabinet member to wangle his news . When Texas cops caught Hoodlum Bonnie Parker for the FBI , Reutlinger phoned a Texas police chief , identified himself as the Chicago chief , burbled : " Just want to congratulate you ! Anything my boys can do for you up here ? " The flattered Texan spilled a detailed story of the capture . By the time the FBI got to the Texan to tell him not to tip off the newspapers , the Herald-American had the story on Page One .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
