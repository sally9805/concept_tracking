txt The function of a wartime tax bill can be simply stated . It is to raise the maximum amount of revenue that can be raised short of the point at which taxes begin to impair production . The objective of such a bill is not primarily to pay for the cost of the war , although that is important . The primary purpose must be to minimize the dangers of inflation . That also is necessary for the effective prosecution of the war . In the battle against inflation we have now moved very far toward control . of the symptoms of inflation  --  rising prices , wages , salaries and profits . We have not yet moved far toward control of the causes of inflation  --  a surplus of purchasing power over the amount of goods andservices available for purchase . That is primarily the job of taxes , supplemented by savings . Debate has now started in the Senate upon this year 's revenue act , more than seven months after consideration of the act began . It is a bill of record-breaking size , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxes and to lift the total revenues of the Federal Government to about $25,000,000,000 . P How does this bill measure up to the requirements of a wartime revenue act ? How close does it come to raising all the money that can be raised short of impairing production ? How close does it come to draining off the surplus of civilian spending power which is forcing up the prices of civilian goods and services ? It is scarcely possible to name an exact point at which taxes become a brake upon production . In the view of many competent observers , corporation taxes as proposed in the new bill are already close to that point . But other taxes must be still far from that level . The taxes upon personal income carried in the Senate bill are estimated to be about one-third lower than the comparable taxes in Canada , and they are still a good way from the level of British taxes . Yet the British , as President Roosevelt recently reminded us , have , up to now , produced more weapons than we have and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the test of how effectively our taxes draw off excess purchasing power , it is clear that we are still far from that objective . This year we shall have a national income of possibly $115,000.000,000 . On the basis of the pending bill Federal taxes will take much less than one-quarter of that amount , and Federal and State taxes combined will take less than a third . Yet currently no more than half our national production is available for civilian consumption , and by next year , we are told , the volume of goods available for civilians will be down to the depression levels of 1932 , when the national income was only about 40 per cent of what it is now . Allowing for the pending taxes , we shall have , according to the estimates of Government officials , an inflationary gap between the amount of purchasing power available and the amount of goods and services that may be purchased at Current prices of $20,000,000,000 to ern Ann onn.000 . Much greater efforts than have yet , been accepted will be needed to reduce this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pressure against price , wage and salary ceilings powerful enough to blow the roof off . The . Treasury has already indicated this view by announcing , even before the Senate bill was introduced , that it will ask for an additional $6,000,000,000 of taxes as soon as Congress is ready to receive the proposals . What those proposals are remains to be seen . It is to be hoped that they will not turn out to be merely a reiteration of plans that have already had the serious consideration of the tax committees and been rejected . Inadequate as it is , the pending tax bill already carries very sharp increases in the personal income tax rates . Indeed , one of its chief defects is that it has relied preponderantly upon increases in the individual , income tax for larger revenue . We shall , no doubt , need still higher taxes of that sort ; but more than that is needed . We must face realistically the need for drawing off much higher taxes and much larger private savings ; but we must face with equal realism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of revenues and new means of stimulating savings .
