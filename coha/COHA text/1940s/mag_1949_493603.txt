THE FULTON . LEWIS SCARE Despite desperate ? and skillful ? efforts to conceal that fact , the great Russian spy scare of Fulton Lewis Jr . has blown up in his face , the worst disaster in his whole public career . He and his " witness , " the excitable and credulous G. Racey Jordan , said between them that Harry Hopkins sent uranium to Russia in 1943 , overruling Lieutenant General Leslie R. Groves , in charge of the atomic-bomb project for the Army ; that Vice President Henry Wallace also intervened to get the uranium shipped ; and that an attempt was made to send planes containing radar to Russia . This set of charges turns out to be composed in about equal parts of falsehood and of misinterpretation of fact . Harry Hopkins is dead and can not defend himself ; but General Groves denies the story , both as to Hopkins and as to Wallace . Wallace also denies it , and has demanded of the Un-American Activities Committee the right to be heard in his own defense ? a right not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turns out that three-quarters of a ton of non-fissionable uranium derivatives was sent to Russia in a routine way , partly because to withhold it might have given the Russians an important clue to our efforts to make a bomb ? efforts which had not yet succeeded . That the Russians , some time later , were doing their best to steal American atom-bomb secrets was amply proved by the Canadian spy trials ; but there is no reason to believe the outrageous suggestion that they were helped in the slightest degree by Hopkins or Wallace . As for the radar , only a few months later the US Army was officially training the Russians in its use , with American equipment . What Fulton Lewis Jr . and a lot of other people seem to forget is that in 1943 the US and Russia were fighting as allies against Germany . If former Major Jordan did what he claims , and removed radar from planes bound for Russia , he thereby weakened the military effort of an American ally , and perhaps lengthened the war and sacrificed the lives of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the safety of Great Falls , Montana . Jordan 's action , if known in wartime , could have subjected him to court-martial . We do n't know Jordan 's motive in boasting of what he did , but we are well aware of the motives of Fulton Lewis Jr . His wild charges were part of his campaign over many years to smear in every way possible the New Deal , the Fair Deal , and everybody not in accord with the most reactionary political beliefs . NEXT CASE The man who set himself up as a super-judge of who is and who , is not a " good American " has been found guilty of fraud against the government . The sentence which the court handed J. Parnell Thomas ( R , N. J. ) ? six to 18 months in jail and a $10,000 fine ? is light compared to the punishment he handed out as chairman of the House Committee on Un-American ' Activities . And before and during his brief trial , Thomas received greater consideration than he ever gave a " hostile " witness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not based on the contents of a letter from a crackpot or a disgruntled government official or an ex-Communist seeking publicity . US District Attorney George Morris Fay traced kickbacks of salaries to Thomas from three women carried on his office payroll . The amount received by Thomas in kickbacks was $8,800 , peanuts to big pork-barrel politicians . Now that the great apostle of " Americanism " has been confirm2d as a cheap thief , the Department o Lice can concentrate on another case that has been pending for more than a year . Complaints have been filed with the Justice Department , charging Representative Alvin O'Konski ( R , Wis. ) with kickback activities not unlike Thomas ' . In a letter it addressed to Attorney General J. Howard McGrath last week , the Madison Capital Times cited the following charges lodged with the Justice Department by several attorneys in Wisconsin : 011 , That O'Konski had at least two employees of his Hurley ( Wis. ) newspaper on his Congressional secretarial payroll , and had an arrangement whereby these employees kicked back part of their money into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used federal government money to help pay for the Montreal River Miner , a weekly newspaper , which O'Konski purchased in 1940 from Martin Vickers . O'Konski , it is said , arranged this by placing Vickers on the government payroll as one of his Congressional secretaries . ( O'Konski admitted in a signed statement to Tax Auditor Lundberg that " Martin Vickers did not have any duties as a Congressional secretary . " ) The Wisconsin Department of Taxation , in recent proceedings which forced O'Konski to pay taxes on income which he failed to report , charged that he had benefited personally from the Congressional payroll juggling lie carried on . The Department 's brief said : " By reason of his position as Congressman , therefore , O'Konski ) derived an economic gain over and above his Congressional salary in the amount of $1,935 in 1943 and $1,003 in 1944 . . . . " ALVIN JOHNSON AT 75 A few weeks ago , John Dewey 's ninetieth birthday was celebrated by most of the civilized world . Of all the tributes paid him , he preferred , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the NR , October 3r ) . Now Dr. Johnson is himself in for a birthday celebration , his seventy-fifth , on December 18 . Though he is best known for his service as an editor of this magazine , and as director for many years of the New School for Social Research , Dr. Johnson 's net has been widely cast . He taught at Bryn Mawr , Columbia , Nebraska , Texas , Chi- cago , Stanford , Cornell and Yale ; worked on three encyclopedias , and was largely responsible for one of them , the brilliant Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences ; was active in the New York State Committee against Discrimination in Employment ; wrote eight books , and found time for a richly variegated private life with family and friends . For years , his short , lucid editorials in the New School Bulletin were treasured by aficionados of good thinking and good prose . In his letter to John Dewey , Dr , Johnson re ferred to that great man as the latest of the Greek philosophers ; and the reference is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few Americans today who would have been at home in the Athens of Phidias , Anaxagoras , Socrates and Pericles ; Alvin Johnson is high on that small list . EQUALITY IN HOUSING The Administration has finally taken a long-delayed step to stop the widespread use of racial restrictive covenants . The Federal Housing Administration has announced that after a specified date it will refuse to aid the financing of any properties if a covenant racially restricting the use or occupancy of the property has been recorded . At the same time the Housing and Home Finance Administration has issued a new regulation for Slum Clearance and Urban Redevelopment that goes even farther . It prohibits the placing of any covenant on land sold or leased by local public agencies for redevelopment purposes that restricts the sale or occupancy of the property on the basis of race , color or creed . Although both regulations are in accord with the 1948 decision of the Supreme Court that restrictive covenants can not be enforced in the courts , Southern real-estate interests and Congressmen have assailed the policy as " Truman 's most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vice-president of the Home Builders ' Association of New Orleans , said , " I do n't know how it 's going to apply doWn here . We 're building homes for white people . Do they expect us to sell them to Negroes , too ? " The confdsion was so great that FHA Commissioner Franklin D. Richards issued a clarifying statement that the new regulations will not affect covenants now on record ; it simply bars builders from signing Written agreements restricting tenants . Some 300 housing experts at a Con- ference of the New York State Committee on Discrimination in Housing ' last week passed a ' resolution urg= ing the FHA to go beyond the new policy and refuse aid to any housing project which practises discrimination , even though no restrictive agreement is on file . The resolution declared that discrimination " by gentleman 's agreement " should not receive federal support . Actually , it was the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People that started the ball rolling with a letter to President Truman last February charging the FHA with lending " its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " White House , FHA and NAACP representatives met together to work out the new policy . Thurgood Marshall , attorney for the NAACP , who sat in on some of the conferences , said the new regulation is " a terrific step forward , " but added that the next step is to have the FHA declare it will make no loans unless the borrower pledges non-discriminatory use of his property . The Negro groups would like the FHA to follow the lead of Nathaniel S. Keith , federal director of slum clearance and urban redevelopment , who announced that from now on federal funds for slum clearance will be denied public agencies if the slum area is to be redeveloped on a covenanted basis . MORE MONOPOLY EVIDENCE The first study since before the war on the degree of concentration of output in major American industries corroborates the findings of the Federal Trade Commission on the extreme stage of monopoly that has now been reached . The Department of COmmerce has found that in 144 of 440 industries studied , the four largest companies manufacture more than 50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the 440 industries , the first four companies are responsible for more than 75 percent of production . Dividing these industries into 20 broad groups , the Commerce Department found even clearer evidence of intense concentration . Of the total shipments in the broad group of tobacco manufacturers , for instance , 82percent in 1947 were made by branches of the industry in which the four largest companies accounted for 75 percent of production . In the broad group of rubber manufacturers , 65 percent of the shipments were by industrial sections dominated ? to the extent of 75 percent by the top four companies . More than 65 percent of shipments of electrical machinery were made by industries in which the first four producers account for 50 percent of the total . The Celler Committee on Study of Monopoly Power , at whose request the Commerce Department analysis was prepared , has performed a useful service in reassembling the facts about increasing concentration . Surely Representative Celler ( D , N. Y. ) and the other members of his group now have an abundance of evidence , from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definite legislative proposal for dealing in the next session of Congress with this economic threat . THE LOBBY AGAINST CO-OPS The tactics of the National Tax Equality Association in North Dakota may lead to an investigation of that organization when Congress comes back in January . Senator Milton Young ( R , N. D. ) recently revealed that the association , which leads the drive to tax dividends of cooperatives , offered him a $10,000 political war chest to back its attack on farmers ' co-ops . Young turned down the offer and threatened to denounce the " NTEA 's scurrilous methods " on the floor of the Senate next month . Senator Young charges that the NTEA has circulated a letter from an " anonymous Senator " which was actually a personal letter that he had written to a North Dakota farmer , " unscrupulously twisted " by the NTEA for its own pUrposes . The NTEA was among the biggest spenders registered this year under the Lobbying Act . The organization reported nine months ' receipts of $367,833 and $44,373 expenses for Congressional lobbying . The National Associated Businessmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $30,923 and spent $29,205 during the same period . These two groups received many contributions from local organizations such as the Minnesota Associated Businessmen , Inc. , the Nebraska Tax Equality Committee and the Indiana Tax Equality Committee , Inc . The new Special House Committee to Investigate Lobbying , headed by Representative Frank Buchanan ( D , Pa. ) , is now studying the NTEA with the intention of holding a full-scale investigation into its lobbying activities next year . Toward a CaIabrian field , far southward beyond the Eboli where Christ stopped , the spit-and-polish jeeps raced . In them were uniformed men with tommy-guns and blackjacks ready to use ; they were the handpicked , strong-armed , quick-triggered members of Interior Minister Mario Scelba 's reparto celere ? the fast section ? that looks and acts more like a wartime commando force than like an adjunct of the national police . On the field was a ragged crowd of men and women , boys and girls in their teens ? day-laboring peasants , landless , workless . The field was part of a vast estate belonging to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncultivated for years , other parts assigned for cultivation to cooperatives of peasants under conditions they could not , despite their best will , meet . The peasants were digging in the ground with rough , mostly homemade , tools . The commander of the jeeps told them to stop digging in the name of the law . The peasants continued to dig ; they were hungry , miserable , too desperate to . care . And as for the law : Article 44 o
