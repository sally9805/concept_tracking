Ordinarily my sleep pattern is a stolid eight hours , and when I recently caught insomnia out of the blue , I was astonished and resentful . Fortunately , insomnia does n't show as much as the common sneeze . so my friends took longer corne to the rescue with cures They tackled me one at a time , over a period of weeks , and this stagger system is undoubtedly what saved me . Better a staggered pigeon than a dead one . The friend who told me about the onion cure for insomnia said she 'd come across it while looking for a saw in a department-store basement . She had stopped to listen to a bald demonstrator giving a spiel about a potato peeler , and she insists that he suddenly announced to his drifting audience , " If you have trouble sleeping at night , here 's what you do . " He told them to slice a large onion and make a sandwich with rye or whole-wheat bread . He warned them white bread would n't do at all . This was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I asked whether the onion was to be peeled , because I was puzzled as to why a man demonstrating  | ( Continued from page 38 ) potato peelers would branch off into a cure for insomnia . My friend said no , no : to peel the onion , just cut off a quarterinch-thick slice with an ordinary kitchen knife . She said it had worked miraculously for her . Her husband had complained that she reeked of onion clear across the bedroom ; but she implied delicately that as I was n't married , this was a technical drawback that need n't concern me . It had never occurred to me before to eat big hunks of raw onion , and after I 'd made the sandwich late that night , I sat eying the bulging thing glumly . For a while I debated whether a glass of beer might n't be better than milk , to top is off ; but in the end I followed the potato peeler 's prescription . Within three minutes , my eyes became soggy with sleep . and I could hardly munch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Somehow I brushed my teeth and crawled , probably on all fours , to bed . It 's true that I slept solidly , but the solid sensation came from a persistent dream that the Sandman was sitting on my stomach . I was wakened about 2 A.M. by low groans , as of an animal in pain . Then I realized that it was no animal ; it was me , Hildegarde . Even in my befuddled state , I managed to think intelligently , " I must have eaten something that disagreed with me . " When I went to the medicine cabinet , I reached blearily for the bottle of rhubarb and soda , poured a slug into a glass ' , and added water . At least , that 's what I assumed I was doing , until I started to swallow and the lining of my throat caught fire . What I 'd mistaken for rhubarb and soda was a mysteriously brown skin tonic a Viennese acquaintance had insisted I use . She had had it made from her own prescription , Number 27139 , For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one foot and gargled frantically with cold water to soothe my ravaged gullet , I wondered if the stuff was poisonous . There were no skull and crossbones on the bottle , and this reassured me , at least mentally . I sat for an hour with my tongue hanging out , panting and unpanting , because life seemed more worthwhile that way . The next morning even a casual observer would have deduced I 'd spent a restless night . In fact , it was several weeks before I 'd recovered enough to try the next cure . THIS cure was a little book called Put Yourself to Sleep , published by Blue Ribbon Books in 1943 and lent to me by a playboy who has a membership card at the New York Public Library . The idea was that the sentences were constructed to act as a monotonous , almost hypnotic lullaby , and that if you read the book at bedtime , you 'd become so drowsy it would be an effort even to turn out the light . The author , Mr. Max Mann , stated this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was tempted to place a modest bet on the opposition . However , by Chapter 2 , I was nodding with boredom over the text , which consisted mostly of variations on : " Sleep is wonderful . Nothing but yourself will prevent you from sleeping . You 're already so tired . Your eyelids are heavy . Your eyes are closing . You 're ready to sleeeeeeep . " It was something in Chapter 3 that yanked me out of my coma . Mr. Max  | Mann had written : " If you want a real test as to whether you are just about ready to sleep , read the following paragraph just once and count the number of R 's in this paragraph . Remember R ' stands for Relaxation . Then count the number of S 's in this paragraph . S ' stands for Sleep . If you are sufficiently relaxed , you will fall asleep . Just the effort you exert in counting these letters will aid you in relaxing , aid you to realize how tired you really are . " How many R 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Count the R 's and count the S 's again and see if you get the same sums . If you do not get the same total , then you know that you are on the road to sleep . " On the road , my eye . I was sitting bolt upright counting on my fingers in a fury . Was it eighteen R 's or twenty-one ? If I had sixteen S 's the first time and four apples on the second try , did that make me a dunce or a good sleeper ? I tripped over to the desk in my bare feet , sneezing irritably , and got paper and pencil to help me keep accurate account of the S 's and R 's . On the way back to bed , I somehow acquired a new murder mystery I 'd avoided opening that evening . Reading a few pages would calm my nerves and make me count better , I thought . At 4 A.M. I finished off the last corpse and remembered the S 's and R 's guiltily ; but by that time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mathematics . I woke again at 5:30 and remembered Mr. Max Mann had stated in his book that sleep is essential to a youthful appearance . Then I waited in a fretful doze for my alarm to go off at 8:15 , so that I might get up and see how unyouthful I looked . After breakfast I counted the S 's and R 's again , and on the fourth and fifth tries I got the same totals twice in a row . That settled , I stuck Put Yourself to Sleep on the shelf on which I keep books to be returned , and returned quick . AWEFK or so later I had dinner with a cousin from Larchmont , who commented on how done in I looked . " I have n't been sleeping too well , " I said piteously , thinking of the time I 'd gone on the night shift with Mr. Max Mann and his S 's and R 's . Suddenly I realized my cousin was telling me her method for overcoming insomnia . " I just listen to the noises , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that puts me to sleep in no time . " When I asked her what noises , she waved her hand vaguely . " Oh , a train whistle or the wind or the refrigerator . Commonplace things like that . " This sounded so normal and sage I could hardly wait for bedtime to try it . As I live in a back apartment on East Eleventh Street , there was n't much use keeping my ears peeled for train whistles . In fact , for quite a while I coulJn ' -k hear a sound , and this worried me . With so much quietness , it would be difficult to work the cure . Finally I heard a rather peculiar noise , or noises : slide , slish , zloop , thud ? just outside my bedroom window . This was tough to identify , and I lay thinking it over carefully . The only thing outside my window is the drainpipe ; perhaps what I heard was rain water running down it . But why should I hear rain water on a clear night ? That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it mean somebody had shinnied down the drainpipe and landed with a thud on my balcony ? The  | only people who have access to the drainpipe are the tenants in the apartment directly above mine , and they had never struck me as the type to go shinnying down rusty pipes at 1 A.M. Once the woman upstairs had come to see me to borrow a pan of ice cubes , and again to return the pan . Surely if she wanted ice cubes again or even a cup of sugar , there were friendlier ways to approach me than via my drainpipe . My cousin from Larchmont had cautioned me that the large part of the battle against insomnia was to identify each commonplace sound as it occurred . Very well , for the present I could identify the slish , zloop , thud only as Supernatural Force Shinnying Down My Drainpipe . In the middle-class life I lead , this was n't exactly a commonplace sound , but at least it absolved the tenants upstairs . I alerted my ears for more noises and was soon rewarded by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then a flurry of crackles , or to be precise about it , trickle , truckle , crackle at intervals of approximately forty seconds I identified this as Wadded-Up Paper Expanding to Full Size in the Night Air . At least , that was the identification I kept repeating to myself doggedly as I got up , procured a large tin tray , and slammed it like a lid over the wastebasket , so that no crackle could leap out and scurry around the floor before I 'd had the superintendent set a trap . When I sneaked back under the covers , all I could hear for quite a while was the pounding of my pulse at high tide . PERHAPS half an hour passed before I heard the refrigerator turn itself or " That 's the hum of ? " I began , but before I could finish a simple declarative sentence , there was the sound of the motor thrashing from side to side like a mad thing . I could identify that noise , all right ; the last time I 'd heard it , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the repairman had explained it was a broken fan belt . I listened with care , thinking I might even identify the moment when the fan belt reached the limit of endurance and broke , with the plaintive twang of a violin string . That would make an interesting ear-witness story to tell a dinner partner some time , leading up to it . of course , with some such bait as : " Have you ever identified the cry of a breakine fan belt ? " If he said , " No , " I 'd have clear sailing . And if he said , " Huh ? " and then left the table immediately , I could save my tidbit and spring it over brandy . I was recalled from this pleasant preview of my social life by the sound of revolver shots in the direction of Fifth Avenue . Novices would have identified them as a car backfiring , but I knew from my extensive reading that murderers always count on that sort of dumb mistake . Close on the echo of the shots came the glurg-glurg of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take a bath at dawn ? unless to wash off bloodstains ? Not only could I identify the sound , but I 'd be prepared to swear to it in court . It must have been soon after this that I identified the noise of the milkman rolling bottles down the Tall . Then I wound the blanket around my ears to muffle them , and to stop the twitching . Sometime during the following month , read in Time that insomniacs should n't Ise much salt on food . I never think  | of adding salt to anything I 'm eating , so I would n't even have to cut down . This in itself seemed a very constructive impasse , and I might have snuggled down in it indefinitely if another friend , whose married name is Legion , had n't told me about a cure she insisted was foolproof . She had read about the method in a piece written for the Baltimore Sun several years before , by J. P. McEvoy . As far as I could make out from her eloquent description , Mr. McEvoy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep by bits . My informant said to start with the scalp and make sure it was completely relaxed . " How ? " I asked . She said I 'd know when I tried it . " Then you go straight down , relaxing every single part of your body , " she went on . " You must n't miss any section . That 's very important . If one part seems stubborn , you must pause there until you think away the tension . I find it helps to talk out loud in a calm voice . " She explained that the first few nights , I might get as far down as my toes before sleep claimed me , but that soon I 'd be asleep at the neck or thereabouts . " Mr. McEvoy said , in the article , he 'd never got past his arms in years , " she told me . I was charmed at the thought of Mr. McEvoy fighting gamely to get past his arms . I GOT home very late that night , and I was simply too tired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , however , I was in bed . by twelve and tense with expectation . Following Mr. McEvoy 's instructions , as relayed by my friend , I started with my scalp . First I wriggled it tentatively , and it seemed loose enough , but I was n't quite sure . " Comfy ? " I asked it softly . Taking silence for assent , I then went to work on my forehead . " Relax , " I told it . " This thing is too big for both of us . " Next I stretched my neck around . This felt so luxurious and relaxing that I kept stretching my neck until I 'd unhinged a minor vertebra and had to revolve like a globe until it fell into place again . I was talking in a calm voice to my collarbone when I recalled that my friend had said not to skip any section . She had specifically mentioned , " Let your jaw sag . " I turned back and sagged my jaw . Some dim point from a college physiology course reared in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top of the windpipe . " If I relaxed my epiglottis , what happened if I swallowed in my sleep ? The coroner might call it death by strangulation . In as steadying a whisper as possible , I advised my epiglottis to sit tight . Then I relaxed my shoulder blades and a large , uncharted area I thought of as my spine . That done , I flapped my arms up and down outside the covers until I felt really pleased with their looseness . There , I 'd got past my arms , and that was more than Mr. J. P. McEvoy could say . It was now time to approach my diaphragm . It felt taut and would need a bit of talking to . " Slump , " I said . That sounded rather terse , so I tried , " Sag and slump . " This was better . In fact , it was so good that I sang it to the tune of Sweet and Low . " Sag and slump , sag and sluuummmmmmmp . " As a lullaby for the middle-size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now talked , sung , or bullied my way down to the thighs . They seemed okay , as thighs go . It occurred to me  | that nobody ever used the phrase " tens thighs , " and the chances were that horizontal thighs were always relaxed . Thi , seemed to me such graceful logic I lay happily basking in the workings of m brain for some time . Finally I bethought myself of the rump bone , or sacrum. and rolled over to make sure it was at ease . It was . Then I flexed my kneecaps once over lightly , admired my reflexes . and loosened my fibia on the home stretch . One foot was asleep , but I rubbed it awake , and curle and uncurled my toes pleasantly . Now what : I suddenly realized I 'd run out of parts . just when I was feeling at my chattiest . I lighted a cigarette and wished I had somebody less taciturn than my hod ; to talk to . The only reason I did n't see the dawn was that I kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phoned in the morning to ask how I 'd made out with the J. P. McEvoy method , and she said I should have started right in at the top again and relaxed all the parts over and over . until I was asleep . I promised her I 'd try that , and perhaps I really intended to , but- that same day a young actress stopped in to borrow my hair dryer , and she mentioned a cure for insomnia that caught me by the throat . She herself is a child of Nature and Broadway who always sleeps heartily from 3 A.M. to noon , so she was very offhand about discussing the method . She said that when she was a child , she spent every summer at a girls ' camp . " The woman who owned the camp always insisted on our taking a nap right after lunch , " she told me . " I never felt sleepy , but the counselor in our cabin taught us a little trick . All you do is flop down on the bed and say Hemlock ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no idea why Hemlock had been chosen as the password to sleep . and this impressed me even more . " Try it if you want to , " my visitor said casually . " What can you lose ? " This takeit-or-skip-it attitude sold me completely . That night I got into bed , and I distinctly remember saying " Hemlock " three times . When I woke eight hours later , I felt wonderful . That 's been my sleep routine ever since . Obviously , the counselor at that girls ' camp happened on a piece of witchcraft , and thank goodness she had the gumption to pass it on . Now all I want is a toad 's hind leg to wear on a string around my neck to ward off drafts.  |
