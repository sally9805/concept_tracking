When TIME reappeared on German newsstands two months ago after seven years ' absence , Journalist Peter Weidenreich thought that the blow ought to be softened . A native Berliner who left Germany for the U.S. about the time Hitler 's Wehrmacht moved into Austria , became a naturalized American citizen , served with SHAEF 's Psychological Warfare Division ( as radio commentator and editor of German-language newspapers ) in the late war , Weidenreich figured that TIME would be a stiff jolt for Germans accustomed to the controlled misinformation of Herr Gocbbels ' press . To help make TIME more intelligible to German readers , he wrote the following piece ( given here in translation ) for Berlin 's Tagesspiegel . Although I disagree with some of his observations , I found his viewpoint interesting and believe you will , too : <P> " I can well remember the astonishment with which , as a newly naturalized American citizen , I first saw TIME Magazine . I thought that I had gained a working knowledge of America and the American idiom through dictionaries and constant reading of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I saw the miniature package of world events between the covers of TIME . Names mentioned in the telegram-like articles were usually unknown to me ; parts of its contents seemed incomprehensible , others without meaning . The pushed-together political reviews which , like other stories coming from dozens of sources , were all strung through the same needle 's eye , were a complete mystery to me . And then the captions ; and the language altogether . I gave up . <P> " Today , Friday means TIMEday to me . After years of reading the magazine I am now content not to find some events which all other papers wrote up , but to find others , which the New York Times had disregarded , take on new meaning when brought together with the other occurrences in their field . The reader sits in the needle 's eye where all the news is being pulled through , and he is amazed . <P> " This week I read that TIME will be sold once more in Berlin-together with the Tgliche Rundschau , the Telegraf , the Kurier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Perhaps some explanations will be in order , so that the ' New Germany ' wo n't mistake a critique of President Truman as the first step by certain political elements to start a ' putsch ' or news about Russian officers being arrested somewhere as the beginning of a new war . Here , therefore , are some comments that may help in reading TIME : <P> " This magazine belongs to a private enterprise ; it is not controlled by any officials of any kind , and is NOT the official American mouthpiece . <P> " It is meant for American readers ; it is not tailored for your consumption . <P> " TIME presumes its readers to have a thorough knowledge of current events , and expects them to follow the news in daily papers also . <P> " Its picture captions will be almost unintelligible as far as you are concerned . Do n't worry too much about them ; even many Americans do n't ( I still have to read the captions twice and three times ) . <P> " TIME believes , no , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything in it , they will throw their mighty machine of newsgatherers into third gear and somehow prove you wrong , even if it 's terribly costly .
