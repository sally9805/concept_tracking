 | Hell-Bent for War Condensed from the book of the same title by Hugh S. Johnson HE LEASE-LEND BILL was passed , with a smashing majority , in the best tradition of free American debate . But let us not forget one thing . It was not advanced as a measure either to get us into war or to put us into a position to accept responsibility to reconstruct the world after the war . On the contrary , it was advanced as a measure to keep the war away from our shores ? and for that reason alone . Every survey of public opinion still indicates a large majority against our engaging in bloody war on foreign shores . There is hardly any opposition to our sending aid to Great Britain . Certainly there has been none from me . Americans have been asked for support of " methods short of war " and have gladly given it . But that consent has been used to cajole from them authority and powers to act which may become war itself . A minority made up of clever people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clutch of circumstance which would lead us into the worst mortal conflict that ever ensanguined this earth . My own position is simply this : Terrific destructive forces are abroad in the world . We could be strong enough to keep them out of this hemisphere but not strong enough to police the Eastern Hemisphere . We are not strong enough to keep them out of this hemisphere unless we convert our boundless potential resources into an impregnable defensive armament . In this preparatory effort we should encourage and aid Britain , which stands between us and these sinister forces , but we can not afford to depend at the last on any force but the mailed strength of our own right arm and the valor , fidelity ,  | resourcefulness and patriotism of our own people . We can aid other nations wherever their interests are parallel with ours . We should never be put in a position of principal reliance on them for our own defense . Europe is a shambles of nations which relied for their protection upon strength other than their own . If America is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which amount to alliance , and we are to take the responsibility to defend her wherever she is threatened , then we are not only " hell-bent for war " but in war to the uttermost . THE QUESTION iS usually asked , " How could we get into the shooting part of the war ? The British do n't want our troops ? only our tools . " A man would be a fool to attempt specific prophecy . We might fight on the high seas to prevent the destruction of millions of dollars ' worth of munitions for which we have paid . If there are great losses of this precious stuff , our public is going to ask , " Are we spending these billions just to sink them in the sea ? " Perhaps it is too late to talk about it but no nation can be gun-moll to a trigger man in such ruthless war of extermination and expect to keep long out of the line of fire . Moreover , if we once get mixed up in war we wo n't decide alone where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say about that . We shall have to fight not only wherever we are threatened but wherever Britain is threatened ? from the Straits of Malacca to the Straits of Dover and back again ? to preserve not only her free States , such as Australia , but her colonies , from the Andaman Islands to equatorial Africa . It is just too much territory and an even more indefensible inconsistency . " I know it is natural for Ministers to wish to play a great part on the European stage , to bestride Europe in the cause of peace and to be as it were its saviors . You can not be saviors on a limited liability . I agree with the statement of the late Mr. Bonar Law who said that we can not be the policemen of the whole world . We have to discharge our obligations but we can not take upon ourselves undue obligations . " That is what Mr. Winston Churchill said in November 1933 . He perhaps would not recommend it to us just now but it is the kind of sound advice which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Churchill and others have advanced the assurance that nobody wants our men , that this is a war of machines only , and so our war-minded leaders say that American mothers need never fear the loss of a single American son abroad . Those who were saying that a few months ago now add " except perhaps in the navy and the marines . "  | just why are we preparing another army of four million and England and the Empire an equal number ? 12 or 13 millions in all ? To watch a " war of machines " ? With what is Mr. Churchill going to " crush Hitler " out of existence and restore all the conquered coun-tries ? Make no mistake about it , there is n't a military " expert " in any country who will deny that there is n't a chance of that kind of an outcome of this war ? the complete conquest of Hitler ? without an immense American expeditionary force , probably larger than the last one , fighting once more on battlefields blood-soaked for centuries . If that happens , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race . Mr. Churchill himself has said , " Britain could , I believe , save herself for the time being , but it will take the combined efforts of the whole English-speaking world to save mankind and Europe from the menace of Hitlerism and open the paths of progress to the people . " Make no mistake about it . If we get into this war so unthriftily , so unnecessarily , we shall have to follow it to the bitter ends . Perhaps we have gone too far already eve to escape . For we are hell-bent for war We are hell-bent for a war that will bankrupt our economy , destroy our democracy and possibly wreck what we now laughingly cal " Western Civilization " ? no matter who wins . A RECENT New York Times dispatch from London summarized the British attitude toward us in some such way as this : " You ? not we ? insist that we are fighting your war . You say that , precisely as we hired and sent the Hessians to break George Washington and your Revolution , you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threat by the common enemy . You are hiring us by furnishing us with weapons and by promising us money and credit . Well , if that is so , it is up to you to deliver the goods ? not on New York docks but here in England ? to force them through Hitler 's air and submarine blockade . " If I had believed and said that Britain is " fighting our war , " I would n't know how to answer that argument . In fact I would be ashamed to try . If Britain is fighting our war ? defending our shores ? then there is no excuse for our not engaging in total war on , under and over the land and sea ? and doing it tomorrow . If that is true , our failure to fight is the most pusillanimous chapter in American history . That British argument is correct from another angle . I ca n't recall any English official urging that they are " fighting our war . " It has been said plenty of times but always by American neck-stickers-  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When a man insists on effective aid by " methods short of war " to a country which he claims is " fighting our war , " he is convicted out of his own mouth of one of two great evils . Either he is urging on his fellow Americans a cowardly course of permitting mercenaries to defend our liberties where he is unwilling to risk his own life , or he is employing a Satanic guile in an effort to draw a great peaceful country which is opposed to warinvolvement into a situation from which it can not retreat without open war . In this modern sloganeering day , when life is too complex for the average layman to think things through and the truth which he is allowed to hear is too fragmentary to permit him to form his own sound judgments , the constant repetition of a lie has become the most frequently used and successful weapon of the propagandist . " Britain is fighting our war " is the slogan that the interventionists repeat most frequently today . This leading by the nose of American public opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the most expert pieces of propaganda in all the records of publicity and , from the American standpoint , one of the most evil . THERE IS not , and there never has been , any altruism among nations . No government has ever conducted its affairs in the interest of any people other than its own ? except on certain occasions when Uncle Sap has done so ? as he is being euchred into doing now . To say that " England is fighting our war " is just too much for prudent American consumption . Britain is fighting her own war . She made hideous errors in timing it and preparing for it but the facts remain that her principal fight is to retain her dominant Empire position . We are vitally interested in seeing that her keypoints in this hemisphere do not fall into hostile hands , and in the preservation of the British fleet in the Atlantic , but the idea that there is any such community of interest as would raise an obligation of honor in us to be slain for Singapore or Suez , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a large part of Asia , is plain baloney . To the extent that Britain 's interest parallels ours , I say , " Support her . " To the extent that support of her butters our insufficient strength too thin over too wide an area and instead of building our defense in our two bordering oceans dissipates it far abroad , let us say , " America first , last and all the time . " WHAT ARE the aims for which tell us we should take an active part in the world conflagration ? In the President 's lease-lend " fireside chat " he said one purpose was so that we  | might have a hand " in the reconstruction of the world . " He has also given us a glimpse of what we are going to give the world in its reconstruction ? the " four freedoms " : ( i ) of speech , ( 2 ) of religion , ( 3 ) from want , ( 4. ) from fear . We have done pretty well on freedom of speech and religion here in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " no distant millennium , " as Mr. Roosevelt says , but " within our own time and generation , " to free the world of want and fear ? The whole world , mind you ! We have n't freed our own country . Jesus said , " Ye have the poor with you always . " If since the beginning of time a man ever lived who never has known fear , there is no record of it . It is some assignment to free the world of want and fear . Ca n't we talk sense ? Eight years ago , we started out to reconstruct America . Great good was done . Many old social abuses were remedied . But is our country stronger and better ? There has been an increase of debt of about 30 billions . Taxes take the fruit of current daily work . Debt either mortgages the future or promises new dissipation , through inflation , of the savings of the past ? even to their complete destruction . The crippled economic system of America has not been made right . Except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the fundamental condition is worse . Having failed in the primary , basic effort of " reconstructing " America after an expenditure of 50 billions , we are now to try to reconstruct the world at a cost nobody has ever taken the trouble to compute . Step by cautious step we have been led down the road , away from any concept of defense of America or the Americas , to engagement in what we are now told is to attain domination of the world in association with others , and then , in further association with them , to " reconstruct " it . In all this two things are appearing more and more certain : first , that we shall have to finance a large part of the reconquest ? we have already begun and have held out the offer to do infinitely more ; second , that we shall also have to finance the reconstruction . Not much has been said about that but since all these countries , except us , are bankrupt , and since reconstruction requires finance , we are elected before we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what we did in the first World War . First we entered it , as the then President said , to " make the world safe for democracy . . . to give the utmost practicable cooperation in counsel and action with the governments now at war with Germany , supplying them with money and credits . " Mr. Wilson firmly believed at first that our part would be precisely what we are told it will be now ? money , materials and machines , not men . We  | sent eleven billions in " machines , materials and money . " We also sent at frantic demand a vast army . We fought from the Marne to Siberia . We outlaid 40 billions . We were then also going first to reconquer and afterward reconstruct the world . We made postwar private and public loans to what Mr. Hoover called " backward and crippled countries " by the billions . They were mostly defaulted . As Will Rogers loved to say , " we never lost a war or won a conference . " We bought for ourselves out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depression in history . We did n't make the world safe for democracy . We disarmed . We helped finance the destruction of democracies . We did n't " reconstruct the world " ? at least not in the sense we intended . Our associates in this high emprise sat by to see the autocratic world reconstructed by Hitler , Mussolini , Stalin and the Japanese . We are right back where we started from and getting all ready to do it all over again with hardly a variation in timing sequence or superficial sloganeering . UT THERE IS one great difference which is seldom mentioned . We got into the first World War with negligible taxes and debt and a long unbroken record of Treasury surpluses and superb fiscal strength . We are getting into this one with a colossal debt , a crushing burden of taxation and an II-year record of staggering deficits . We entered the last war with an economic system functioning , with some slight lag , on the old American system of universal employment and almost unlimited individual opportunity . We enter this one with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with library paste or stuck together with spit . There are dangers here such as our country has never known ? dangers of our unthrifty engagement in universal bloody war , dangers of collapse in our fiscal and economic system , dangers of a complete revolution in our political system . Certainly there are dangers of our dissipating our military , naval and economic strength over areas as wide as the world , of injecting them into problems of which we have little knowledge and less interest , and of concentration of our government on almost everything except the material , spiritual and political welfare of our own people . This kind of talk is characterized by the opponents as " isolationism . " It may be " isolationism " to insist , as I have done for years , on military , naval and air preparation to defend ourselves against any intruder on this hemisphere ? with ultimate reliance on nothing and nobody but the patriotism , loyalty and devotion of our own people , the efficiency of our own systems , the strength of our own right arm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibility for half a principal planet in the solar system , but it seems to me it would be safer to do that ? and to prepare as we acceptably could to do it well , so well that we would be safe from challenge ? than to go out wholly unequipped , unprepared , and badly financed to assume responsibility first for the reconquest and then for the reconstruction of the whole round earth , to abolish want and fear everywhere . This may be realistic and not idealistic . That is now a position of unpopularity . But it is one thing for a man to be " idealistic " with his own life , efforts and fortune ? and quite another thing to be " idealistic " without also being realistic with the fate and future of a great people . It seems to me that the opening of our treasury , our granaries and our whole industrial plant to British uses at the expense of the American people is a sufficient contribution , without using that wholesome and unusual generosity as a rope to tie our fate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let 's help England to the precise extent that we can do it if , and only if , it does not embroil us , all unready , in foreign wars ? and no further . Let 's push the pedal down for all-out armament and defensive production for an American Army and Navy so strong that , considering our wet ditches of thousands of miles of blue water , no nation on earth will dare to attack or even challenge us in our own hemisphere . Let 's not set out to reconquer the world and above all let 's not assume a responsibility to reconstruct it . We had enough to do to reconstruct America and we have n't done that yet .
