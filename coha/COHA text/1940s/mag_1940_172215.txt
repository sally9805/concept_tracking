The Eighth Street Theatre in Chicago was once a jinx theatre , but in the past seven years it has become a national institution . By last Saturday night , when as usual its 1,200 seats had been filled and emptied by two consecutive paying audiences , no fewer than 860,013 people had given 35 to 75 to get in and watch a freestyle , catch-as-catch-can radio show on a stage representing a hayloft . Station WLS 's Barn Dance is a corny five-hour jamboree , radio 's longest* and oldest in continuous operation , tops in Crossley ratings in its class . Last week this program , begun a week after Station WLS first took to the air and its mainstay ever since , celebrated its 16th birthday . <P> Not on hand for the celebration was the chief character of the Barn Dance , spry , crackly-voiced , cotton-chin-whiskered Uncle Ezra ( dapper little Pat Barrett , 52 ) , who greets the audience with " Howdy , evvabuddy , " warms evvabuddy 's heart with his cracker-barrel philosophy . Uncle Ezra was in Hollywood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Round the Mountain . So Widow Winnie Whipple , whose ineffectual attempts to land Uncle Ezra furnish continuity of a sort for the program , exclaimed " Hollywood my left hind foot ! " and wept that he should turn out to be " nothin ' but a Gay Lombardo " - to which Master of Ceremonies Joe Kelly , to make sure everyone got it , rejoined : " You mean a gay Lothario , do n't you ? " And so on and so on , no chestnuts barred in a script whose humor formula runs like this : " I just bought a farm . " " Where is it ? " " Hawaii . " " I 'm fine , how are you ? But where 's this farm ? " " Hawaii . " " I 'm fine , but where 's this farm ? " <P> The WLS Barn Dance goes on the air at 7 p.m . ( C.S.T. ) , is sponsored in pieces of 15 minutes and more by Alka-Seltzer , Keystone Steel &; Wire Co. ( fences ) , Murphy Products Co. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( insurance ) , Edward Funk &; Sons ( hybrid seed corn ) . <P> Station WLS ( standing for World 's Largest Store ) was launched in 1924 by Sears , Roebuck &; Co . A bevy of guests sounded forth , among them Chicago 's Mayor William E. Dever , Jane Addams , the Duncan Sisters . Actress Ethel Barrymore was led up to the mike and , affrighted , throbbed " Oh my God ! , " was then led away . Piped from Manhattan to Chicago were the congratulatory voices of Rudolph Valentino , Arthur Brisbane and Ring Lardner . <P> In 1928 WLS was sold to a giant ( 6 ft. 3 in. , 235 Ib. ) newspaperman , Burridge Davenal Butler , owner of The Prairie Farmer , oldest ( 99 years ) of its kind in the U. S. Owner Butler made WLS a public servant in the Midwest . Most famed alumnus of WLS programs is Gene Autry , who once sang on the Barn Dance . So did Ruth Etting , at first for nothing and then for $5 a night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fibber McGee &; Molly worked there before they adopted those names , as did Charles J. Correll and Freeman F. Gosden , now known as Amos ' n ' Andy . For ten years the station has received more than 1,000,000 letters annually , a record .
