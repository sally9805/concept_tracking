A wind whipped across Newark Bay , whistled through the skeleton structures of ways and unfinished steel ships . Inside one of the vast , gaping hulls , on the sunny side of a bulkhead , was a warm , temporarily peaceful spot . A man in a blue workshirt took a quick look around , grunted , eased himself down . Thousands of other men were riveting , welding , working in other parts of the great yard . For half an hour or so he would not be missed . He snoozed . <P> Up &; down the East , West , Gulf coasts , this scene was repeated . No strikes held up the job , but workers loafed , " lost themselves behind the bulkheads , " as though the most critical and frightening need of the whole war program last week was not for ships , ships , ships . <P> Other workers simply played hooky . In Maine , officials reported that every day from 10% to 15% of the employes at the South Portland yards failed to show up . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their farms . Some stayed home to fish . Some just stayed home . <P> In Washington , Rear Admiral Emory Scott Land , tsar of shipping , himself under fire , appeared with solemn-faced Rear Admiral Howard L. Vickery , Maritime Commissioner in charge of ship construction , before a Congressional investigating committee to make a fuming complaint . Workers were patriotic , he said . <P> If they were sure that the money would not go back to management , they would even give up certain financial gains . The program lagged because the productive spirit lagged . That was not all . Said Jerry Land : " It 's the infernal agitation that 's going around in everybody 's head whether it is closed shop or open shop , whether there will be wage increases or no wage increases . " He had one solution : " A definite labor policy . " <P> On the West Coast , where Admiral Land said the spirit was actually high compared to the East , one shipyard worker charged : " The attitude of most of the men is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money as they can get . " Writing in The Log , Pacific Coast maritime magazine , the worker told of meeting a fellow employe who said he had not really done any work for four months . <P> The attitude was typical , said the writer . " It comes from the system . . . . Money seems to be the least of anyone 's worries-just like water coming out of a hydrant . The more errors , the more delays , the more overtime , the more profit , the more wages-the more for everybody except the Navy . " <P> The workmen , he said , were not the only ones to blame . Bosses were frequently careless , often untrained , often just as laggard as the men . " Some bosses in order to look busy like to get their names on a lot of orders and will order out equipment that wo n't be needed for three or four months . It gets kicked around , damaged and some of it even is swept up by the yardman and lost . " <P> Honest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . " After batting their heads against a stone wall for several months , they decided they could do nothing about it and might as well ride the gravy train like everybody else . . . . I really want to work , but I can tell you if I get a chance to turn out more than an hour 's honest production work on a shift , I 'm doing well . "
