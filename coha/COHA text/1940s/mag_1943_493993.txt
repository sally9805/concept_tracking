Four Men Reshape the World THE BRAVE NEW WORLD , which the reactionaries al- ways ridicule liberals for expecting , was not shaped at Cairo and Teheran : but if some sort of new world ever does get shaped , the meetings of the four great United Nations leaders will count for as much in its creation as anything that has happened . The people who say that only battles count , and that conferences w never won a ar , utter a dangerous half-truth . Battles can become a senseless slaughter if they are not coOrdinated ; the enemy can win more by dividing his opponents than by shooting them ; and wars that are won on the battlefield can be lost again in the bleak stretches of the old diplomacy . The great and shining achievement at Cairo and Teheran was a meeting of minds of the four leaders . To the dismay of our enemies abroad and at home , the United Nations are now ' a solid front . This may save a million deaths on the battlefield , and a decade of waste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men who took part in the conferences ? Roosevelt , Churchill , Stalin and Chiang Kaishek ? have earned the gratitude of the free people of the world . But it is clear that if primacy in this gratitude belongs to anyone , it is to President Roosevelt His was the shaping conception , his the initiative that brought the men together , his the genius for compromise that kept them in the channel of the main chance while avoiding the shoals and rocks of their differences . It is now clear that the Moscow Pact , in the making of which Secretary Hull acted with a realism and a vision unexampled in the State Department annals , was in reality Roosevelt 's triumph even more than Hull 's . It was part of Roosevelt 's master plan for the last stages of the war and the first stages of the peace . In fact , the meetings at Moscow , Cairo and Teheran are best seen not as separate conferences , but as successive phases of a single plan for unified action . The best way to assess the importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the plan had not been shaped , and what may happen yet if for is ? I any reason it s not carried out . Let us put it in terms of the dangers that the Allies faced in such an event First , there was the danger of a separate peace by any of the big Allied powers , or of separate terms of the enemy 's surrender drawn up without consulting the other Allies . Second , there was the danger that the attack on the enemy would not be concentrated and coordinated , and the enemy thus escape the full strength of a coalition war . Third , there was the danger that even after defeat the Germans and the Japanese would be able to drive the kind of peace bargain that would enable them to rise once more , like malignant and destructive phoenixes , from the ashes of their defeat . Fourth , there was the danger that the Great Powers would all have different plans for the kind of postwar governments that would be established in Europe , the Near Fast and the Far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of civil wars . Fifth , there was the danger that the Great Powers would allow their divergent views about boundaries , trade , empire , spheres of influence , to blot out their and common interests and common stake in the future . Think of what it would have meant to hundreds of millions of people all over the world , and to unborn hundreds of millions more , if these dangers had not been met and conquered . To meet them there was need for united action , decisive action , immediate action . The answer was given at Moscow , at Cairo , and supremely at Teheran . First of all , with those conferences the hopes that Hitler and Tojo and their henchmen still nurtured for some sort . of negotiated peace have gone glimmering . The vicious talk of McCormick and Hearst about a separate peace between Russia and Germany is no longer possible . The fear that the long exhaustion of China , her lack of arms and food , might lead to the triumph of the fascist elements within her , has now also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the enemy except unconditional surrender , on terms agreed to by all the Allies . That the enemy faces surrender is now also dearer than ever . The Cairo communique , devoted to the questions of the Far East , ended with a recognition that " serious and prolonged operations " would be needed to defeat Japan . But some of those operations have already been set in motion , and the rest will follow as soon as the full force of America , Britain and Russia can be released from the European war . And as for the German enemy , the Teheran communique reports , with a terseness that bodes ill for Hitler , that the military staffs of the three powers have decided upon the scope and timing of operations which will be undertaken from East West and South . " This can only mean that the much mooted question of the opening of a second front has already been de- . cided to the satisfaction of the Russians , as well as of the British kind American generals . It can only mean , i ? - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Continent , no doubt General Marshall , has been selected , that he will have Russian as well as British officers on his staff to aid him with their experience in out-guessing and out-maneuvering Hitler 's generals , and that the great supply and transport problems are within reach of being surmounted . It can only mean that Allied bases in the Near Fast will be available for harassing the Germans from the air in southern Russia , and that bases in western Russia will be available to our fliers in order to rain death on Nazi industrial targets in Germany and the Balkans . " No power on earth , " the Teheran communique promises , " can prevent our destroying the German armies by land , their U-boats by sea and their war plants from the air . " Thus the bell tolls out Hitler 's vauntings and his savagery . It tolls out also all hope , cherished by the war lords of Japan and Germany , that even a defeat in this war will be only an interlude in their unquenchable struggle to make the world fascist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a Hundred Years ' War , and that any temporary peace will mean to them only a chance to rebuild their armies and navies , and launch another and greater attack when the time comes . The Cairo conference has dealt a death-blow to that hope by promising to strip Japan back to the land and the natural resources she had before World War I , and even before the turn of the century . This means the end of the Japanese empire , and the end of the empire means the end of the danger of a new thrust at world power by Japan . For without her islands and bases in the Pacific , without Korea and Manchukuo , without the rich resources of the lands Japan has taken by conquest , the Japanese will-to-aggression has no naval , military or industrial base . Recent students of , the Japanese mind have pointed out that the Japanese boy grows up with a contempt for all women and for women 's pacific methods , that he is taught to respect only force and ruthlessness , and that this trait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Japanese ruling class . For the first time we have now spoken to the Japanese in acthey , and , cents tney can unaerstana ana respect . we have turned from pleading and appeasement to a drastic commitment of ruthless action which can finally bring only fear and submission from them . The decision on the terms for Germany , which was expected from the Teheran conference ; was not announced . No doubt it awaits the pace and success of our military actions against the F estung-Europa . The problems of political and psychological warfare , to undercut Hitler 's power in Germany and the German will to fight , are more complex than in the case of Japan . We must show firmness and strength . But we must give the German people a sense that they have an alternative that is better than a fight to the end in blind obedience to Hitler and craven fear of Himmler . Let us not allow our hopes to run away with us : Teheran , like Moscow and Cairo , is only a beginning . It is a sketch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a plan of action that needs implementing by action . There will be divergencies and frictions aplenty . Nothing was said in ' the Cairo communique , for example , about Hong Kong and the role that the British will play in it after the war . Nothing was said about Dutch imperialism in the East Indies . Nothing was said about how America would get the bases she needs in the Pacific in order to feel secure . Above all , nothing was said about the menacing shadow of the Indian problem . Nothing was said in the Teheran communique about the Russian boundaries on the west and southwest . Nothing was said about such questions as that of Yugoslavia , where the Liberation Front has formed a new government under Doctor Ivan Ribar. and General Tito that challenges the government of King Peter . One must assume that these questions and others like them will be left to the European Advisory Commission , and to later meetings of the Big Four . It was the beginning of wisdom to establish a common understanding first . With it , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even the slightest problem could ? in an emotionally surcharged atmosphere ? wreck both the war and the peace . For the fact is that , while no specific decisions have been announced about the composition of the new governments of Europe , the general principles have been agreed on . Into the concert of nations are to be admitted " all nations , large and small , whose peoples in , heart and in mind are dedicated , as are our own peoples , to the elimination of tyranny and slavery , oppression and intolerance . " Thus the Teheran communique . The terms are general , but their meaning is unmistakable for every fascist ruling clique in the world , from Germany to Japan , from Franco 's Spain to the puppet government of Manchukuo , from Finland to the Argentine . " We will welcome them as they may choose to come into a world family of democratic nations " ? and the word to emphasize here is " democratic . " Many will object that the small nations were not represented at these conferences , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victory is possible , and before a framework Can be created within which the small nations can function , it is necessary for the big nations to agree on their aims and to prevent their differences from wrecking these aims . Versailles had the small nations all represented , but the fact that they were there did not make it an effective peace . The beginning of wisdom in peace as in war is a meeting of minds of those powers which embody the overwhelming potential force , the resources , the prestige of the world structure . That beginning has now been made . It has been made primarily by four men . One stands for a gallant Tory militancy in the face of fascism , a second for a conservative nationalism emerging out of feudal anarchy , a third for a stable socialism that has learned the values of nationalism without abandoning the international outlook , the fourth for a militant progressivism once embodied in the New Deal and now extended to the international scene . In these four men are united all principles of economic and social organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a free world community . These four men are shaping the world to come ? not alone , for leaders can do nothing without their peoples ? with a leadership that gives direction to their peoples . More than any calculable influence that these conferences will have is the incalculable psychological effect they will have on democratic peoples all over the world . For they show that the leaders of the peoples ' governments of the great United Nations are viourous2 mobile bold and decisive men . Each is a strik-vigorous ing person in his own right , yet they have learned to like and get along with one another . " We came here , " the Teheran communique ends , " with hope and determination . We leave here friends in fact , in spirit and in purpose . " Thus the bell that tolls out the world of Hitler and Tojo rings in the world of a possible democratic future . It rings in a world not perfect but livable , not certain but now clearly approaching , for which the masses of common men have fought and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war complained that the politicians during their absence had deprived them of the right to drink ; this time , if the soldiers ' voting bill passed by the Senate becomes law , they will have the far more substantial grievance that Congress has deprived them of the right to vote in a presidential election which may decide the future for which they are fighting . The Green-Lucas bill for federal administration of a simplified ballot system would have been a workable method of permitting them to vote in 1944 while in the field of action . The Senate passed , 42 to 37 , a substitute proposal which would keep the jurisdiction as to balloting under the several states , whose laws for absentee voting were not adopted for any such contin. , r gency . Seven states do not provide ror aosentee votes in their primaries . Three more do not permit any absentee votes from overseas . Most states require that each absentee voter apply by mail for a ballot ; eleven allow only twenty days or less between the time the application is received and the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only thirty days or less for this operation . There are other barriers . Only 27,000 soldiers cast valid ballots under the similar 1942 law . While the Senate recommended that the states ease these provisions , Sen. Alben Barkley correctly stated that this was like " a pious resolution approved by a ladies ' aid society . "
