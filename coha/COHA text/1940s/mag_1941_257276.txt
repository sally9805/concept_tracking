Last week the most widely read author in the country faced the possibility of deportation proceedings . The charges against him would be the facts , which he swore to be true , that he had written in his book . The author : " Jan Valtin , " whose autobiographical Out of the Night is the life and hard times of an ex-Communist spy who fell into the hands of the Gestapo . It is the season 's literary hot cake . <P> Sleuths deduced , from his own account of a prison term he served in San Quentin in 1926 , that Valtin 's real name is Richard Julius Herman Krebs . He wrote that he left the jail " in the first days of December , 1929 . " The only man who fitted Valtin 's description of himself and who left San Quentin at that time was Convict Krebs . Charges on which he could be deported were his admittedly illegal entrance , his former membership and activity in the Communist Party in Germany . <P> <P> Valtin-Krebs was living last week in New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the former German terrorist and Red agent swirled a storm of conjecture and argument : was his autobiography true or a hoax ? Valtin-Krebs &; friends said it was true ; no respectable evidence has yet been produced to show that it was anything else . And if it was true , under present alien laws , he was liable to deportation back to the Germany whence he had fled . <P> From Attorney General Jackson came one ray of hope for Valtin-Krebs . Worrying over some 8,000 other deportable aliens , last week Mr. Jackson declared that alien legislation was no longer " realistic . " Six thousands of his deportables , he said , could not be sent back " because of conditions beyond our control . " Even subjecting a man to an ocean crossing involved a " sort of contingent sentence of death . " <P> Jackson 's recommendations : 1 ) deposit criminal aliens in jail ; 2 ) parole those who are guilty of only technical infringements ; 3 ) set up a board to examine all deportables . Under whichever category Valtin-Krebs might come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to almost certain death in Nazi Germany .
