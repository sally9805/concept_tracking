txt The historic debate opened in the Senate today over postwar collaboration for a peaceful world . With an overwhelming majority of the Senate favoring some form of international co-operation , the real controversy is one of degree , and turns on whether the resolution shall be a general gesture of good ' will , or something more forthright and specific . Senator Tom Connally ( D ) of Texas , Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee , in opening the debate this morning , declared : " We have tried isolation . It did not bring peace or security . Dictators planned their conquests upon the hope of ' divide and conquer . ' Alone through co-operative action can their made schemes be arrested . " Isolation has failed . Let us try collective security . " He then introduced the so-called " Connally resolution . " This reads : " Resolved , That the war against our enemies be waged until complete victory is achieved . " That the United States , acting through its constitutional processes , join with free and sovereign nations in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aggression and to preserve the peace of the world . " Minimum Expression Advance polls and private expressions indicate that the Connally resolution , so drawn , is the minimum expression of present Senate will to collaborate , It was reported out , 20 to 2 , from Committee , would get the votes of all but a handful of die-hard isolationists . Meanwhile . Senator Claude Pepper ( D ) of Florida , spokesman for the Ball-Burtorf-Hatch-Hill group , waited with a stronger resolution . It is round this that the real tight centers . The Pepper amendment , which is a re-draft of the earlier , so-called B2H2 resolution , specifically proposes that America use its influence to make the United Natidns the nucleus of " an international organization to promote co-operation among nations , with authority to settle international disputes peacefully , and with power , including military force , to suppress military aggression and to preserve the peace of the world . " A wide variety of further amendments and proposals will be offered in the forthcoming expected fortnight or more of debate . Two-Thirds Vote Needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the expected postwar debate by the treaty-ratifying authdrity , which must approve any pact by a two-thirds vote . Failure to get a twothirds vote kept America out of the league . In a larger sense , today 's Senate debate starts a similar debate over the length and breadth of America . It will continue through and after the armistice . The public opinion thus mobilized will seal the fate of postwar co-operation , one way or another . Senator Robert A. Taft , conservative Ohio Republican , injected an important point into the discussion immediately before it opened in the Senate . A supporter of the Connally or ' , mild " resolution , Senator Tatt told an Associated Press correspondent he would propose that the existing machinery of the League of Nations and of the World Court be utilized to simplify the task of organizing the nations for collaboration after the war . References to League Senator Connally referred to the League in his opening speech today . He denied that the League had been a failure . Though it was not " a complete success . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failures have contributed to the public thought and the attitude of the nations and of political leaders . " It is the strategy of the Connally leadership to get the maximum Senate vote for the minimum of international committment . The object is to avoid uncomfortable specific points at this time . It is argued that this might divide the public , and embarrass America 's dealing with its Allies . Advocates of the stronger Pepper amendment proceed from an opposite assumption . They argue that a mere expression of good will is not adequate in the war crisis . Even though their amendment is not adopted they seek the educational benefit of thoroughly airing the issue . Senator Connally took cognizance of critics calling his resolution too " general . " Broad Terms Defended vantage we must declare to the world that our influence and our might will te dedicated to the maintenance of world peace and the suppression of military aggression whenever it may lift its head . " In his statement advocating use of the League machinery , Senator Taft said in part : " I think we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we are willing to abide by the decision of an international tribunal ? on which we can not have a majority vote ? in designating ' X ' as an aggressor and joining in stripping him of his tools of aggression . " Following the Connally speech the issue was thrown open to debate . Senator John A. Danaher ( R ) of Connecticut , generally numbered in the isolationist group , introruced an elaborate amendment to the Connally , version defining terms and requiring among other things that European nations be Permitted to choose their own territories and forms of government after the war . Senator Arthur H. Vandenberg ( R ) of Michigan then took the floor and in a 40-minute speech urged the Senate to approve the Conally resolution without amendment as " the lowest common denominator " of Senate feeling for international co-operation . " Our first job is to win the war and get the boys home , " he declared . " Our wisest pledge at the moment is this general pledge .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
