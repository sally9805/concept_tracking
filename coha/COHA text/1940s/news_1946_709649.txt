txt A straight 10-cent fare on the city 's unified transit lines would supply enough revenue to meet operating expenses , wipe out the existing debt service deficit of about $56,000,000 and meet the expected $15,000,000 pay rise for 32,000 employes , but would fall far short of paying for much-needed rehabilitation work and the construction of new lines like the proposed Sec2 and Avenue subway . Such was the conclusion reached yesterday by a spokesman for the Board of Transportation after reviewing the present fiscal position of the unified lines . Conceding that a 10-cent fare would make it possible for the city to enlarge by $450,000,000 its borrowing power for capital purposes , the spokesman considered it unlikely that any substantial amount of that borrowing power would be used to finance new subways , in , view of the many and urgent demands that would be made upon it by such other essential city services as hospitals , schools , sanitation and the like . 10-Cent Fare Revenue Computed A straight 10-cent fare , according to the latest estimate of the Board of Transportation , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the current fiscal year . From this would be deducted the debt service deficit of approximately $56,000,000 , the estimated $15 , - 000,000 of pay rises to be recommended by Mayor O'Dwyer 's advisory committee on transit , and $132,000,000 of general operating expenses , including present payroll . The result would be a surplus of about $7,000,000 . The most optimistic advocates of a higher fare , however , do not believe it can be achieved before the beginning of the 1947-48 fiscal year , by which time the regular pay increments for transit employes will have increased the total deductions from gross revenues of the unified lines . As matters now stand , the Board of Transportation hopes to " break even " on the current fiscal year , with operating revenues enough to cover operating expenses , leaving the debt service deficit to be met from budget funds and the expected $15,000 , - // 000 to $20,000,000 pay rise to be covered by some typs of municipal bond issue . Charles P. Gross , chairman of tho Board of Transportation , already has indicated that at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transit lines , especially the subways , in the four years from 1946 to 1949 , inclusive . The schedule included by City Construction Coordinator Robert Moses in his report to Mayor O'Dwyer on April 15 , recommended a program of only $166,323,711 for the same period and this amount has been cut by $5,000,000 since the report was submitted . For the current year $80 , - 000,000 has been earmarked in the amended capital budget recently adopted by the City Council , for transit rehabilitation and additional work on construction jobs such as the Hillside Avenue extension in Queens and the Culver Line connection in Brooklyn . As things now stand , the Board of Transportation sees little hope of getting an early start on the proposed $400,000,000 Second Avenue subway , even if the 10-cents fare becomes effective some time in 1947 . Unexpected Revenue Rise An informal check on operating results on the city system during the year ended June 30 has uncovered an unexpected windfall in the way of operating revenue increases . It is now estimated that the year will show a surplus of about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $3,000 , - 000 surplus mentioned in estimates submitted to Controller Lazarus Joseph several months ago . An unexpected rise in passenger traffic on subway and surface lines between February and July is credited for the increase . With the existing subway lines carrying maximum traffic ? loads , the prospect of not being able to get an early start on the Second Avenue subway line has been discouraging to the Board of Transportation . The new line , it was explained , is sorely needed for further dispersal of subway traffic , thus relieving congestion on existing lines and making possible the more efficient operation of the subway system as a whole . Chairman Gross already has indicated his belief that efficient operation of the transit lines , rehabilitation of existing . facilities and construction of new ones should be made possible by increasing the fare . That issue must be settled , in his opinion , by the city itself . Strong recommendations for a higher fare  --  presumably one of 10 cents  --  have been made by Mr. Moses and Edwin S. Salmon , chairman of the City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , did so without objection by Mayor O'Dwyer , if not with his express sanction . The Mayor is known to feel that the matter should go to popular referendum as soon as possible , perhaps by next spring . It is considered probable that the Mayor will seek from the 1946 Legislature authorization for such a referendum through some process not imposing on the Board of Estimate the politically " red hot " burden of actually fixing a higher fare as a condition precedent to a referendum . What the Mayor is reported to want is a bill making it possible for the issue to be submitted directly to the public without first compelling the Board of Estimate or the City Council , or both , to impose a higher fare , subject to approval or rejection by the electorate .
