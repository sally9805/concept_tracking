txt Shipbuilding shows a drop of more than 45,000 workers in New England since its September , 1943 , peak , figures obtained from the regional office of the War Manpower Commission disclosed today . The decrease is credited to reduction in contracts , to workers quitting and to the draft , Some ' yards found it impossible to keep ' up their work force , and are still seeking for key employees . At the high point of 16 months ago 208,000 people were employed in New England shipyards . A year later , in September of 1944 , 173 , - 000 were reported and in November 163,000 . These are all private yards . Since then there has been a further decline but as the January figures are not yet complete , it is not known just how many are employed today . Bay State Shy 27,000 In Massachusetts , the drop amounts to 27,000 workers . Employment slid from 114,000 in September of 1943 to 90,000 in September of 1944 and to 87,000 last November . A third of the cut occurred in Maine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to begin with . Rhode Island proved the single exception by exhibiting a small increase . At the Quincy and Hingham yards operated by the Bethlehem Steel Company  --  the two biggest private yards in New England  --  the falling off totals 21,000 . At its record mark Quincy employed 32,000. it , is stated by company officials . Now they say it has 20.000 . Hingham 's peak saw 23,000 ; today 14,000 . Employment at the Boston Navy Yard has held up more steadily . its figures indicate . Its peak came in July of 1943 with 50,000 workers . For the past nine months it has averaged 40,000 and has that many now . The probable reason for the Navy Yard 's keeping a fairly even level , it was said there today , is that it has a constant heavy repair load which now , with outfitting of ships , makes its principal business , though it continues to do a substantial amount of shipbuilding besides . As skills of workers have increased with experience , many yards have been able to get out production , , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dropping off of employment in Massachusetts was partly due to cuts in contracts and to yards not being able to obtain all the workers needed . In Connecticut and New Hampshire some of the decline was caused by a slackening of contracts . One Shortage Not Typical The sharp drop publicized this I week at the New England Ship-building Corporation of Portland , Maine . is not typical . This is one I , of the only two Maritime Commission yards in New England . It-has ' been building Liberty ships , a slow ' freighter of simple design for convoy use . These ships are a strictly wartime proposition . The old contract will run out in a few months . Some new contract may meantime be obtained . The second Maritime Commission yard is that of the Walsh-Kaiser Company at Providence , R. I. , which has been producing an entirely . different type of ship . Other yards of this region are not affected by the Liberty ship cutback , as most of them are on Navy contracts . In contrast with the Maine yard 's decline the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New England , says it faces in 1945 the biggest year of capital ship construction in its history . It reports Navy contracts ahead of it for two or three , years . Yet right now the great yard , which turns out battleships , aircraft carriers , heavy cruisers , etc. , is troubled by the lack of 250 men ? 100 shipfitters and another 150 who can be trained as shipfitters . " This shortage is causing a bottleneck that is endangering our whole program , " a company spokesman said . " Unless the bottleneck is broken , the Navy may not be able to get the ships as rapidly as it needs them . "
