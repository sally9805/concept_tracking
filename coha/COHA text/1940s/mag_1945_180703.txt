Brazilians last week still had no electoral code , no legal political parties , no idea when the promised Presidential elections would be held . But they did have a new candidate . War Minister Eurico Caspar Dutra 's gold-braided general 's hat was pitched into the ring . As the Government 's entry , Dutra replaced President Getulio Vargas , who a fortnight ago decided that he was " not a candidate . " <P> Archconservative , 59-year-old General Dutra was a thorough and frequent revolutionist until he connected with a successful insurrection . The Revolution of 1904 caught him up in its whirl even before he got through his cadet 's training ; consequently Brazilian officerdom speaks of him as a " Pescoqo de Sola " ( Leatherneck ) -a ranker . In the 1924 revolution , Dutra again fought the Government unsuccessfully . But he hit the jackpot in 1930 when he helped Vargas ' " gauchos " ride into power . Since then he has been a staunch pillar of Brazil 's neo-fascist " New State . " <P> German Cultural Attache von Cossel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may some day change his politics , but Dutra will always be a Nazi . " In 1940 , as a climax to a large purchase of German arms , Dutra accepted the Grand Cross of the German Eagle . The Japanese Embassy filled the Dutra home with a set of bright Nipponese furniture . General Dutra 's admiration for the professional German Army increased as the Nazis swept to " Victory in the West . " But the Nazi stalemate in Russia and the growing Allied strength paled his ardor . In mid-1942 the General discovered a great affection for the U.S. <P> Dutra 's candidacy got a roasting from Rio de Janeiro dailies , most of which support the Opposition candidate , General Eduardo Gomes . When Dutra 's campaign manager , Benedito Valadares , attended a football game in Sao Paulo , the crowd booed him out of the stadium .
