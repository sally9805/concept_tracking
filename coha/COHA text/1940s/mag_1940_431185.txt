Although astrologers differ in their statements about what astrology is , here is a composite view of what they say of it and for it : That the whole course of human life is affected by the position of the celestial bodies at the time of a man 's birth ; That the stars have a definite influence on health , fortune , character , and happiness ; That floods , famine , war , and other disasters can be predicted ; That the best months , weeks , and days for planting and harvesting , for investments , for making love or contracting marriage or bearing children can be foretold ; That the position of the stars at the time of an individual 's birth is determined by casting his or her horoscope ; that this horoscope is the same for every individual born at exactly the same moment in the same latitude and longitude ; That a horoscope will indicate whether a person is aggressive or shy , has artistic traits or financial talents , is impatient , intolerant , kind , generous , brave , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a horoscope and without a medical examination of any kind ; That the horoscopes of man and wife , read in relation , will indicate the success or failure of the mar-riage ; That even inanimate objects , such as ships and airplanes , are influenced by the stars ? that the future of a ship can be predicted if the hour when the keel was laid is known . Millions of Americans have more or less belief in astrology . They consult astrologers , read magazines devoted to astrology , follow the horoscopes that appear daily in hundreds of newspapers . Now , not all of these Americans are unintelligent . There are financiers who want astrological advice on when to buy and sell . Some theatrical producers seek through astrology to know the most propitious Opening Night . Politicians ask whether pending legislation will be passed or certain candidates elected . The most notorious devotee of astrology alive today seems to be Adolph Hitler . Actual proof does not exist that he has several astrologers on his staff and makes his major decisions in accordance with their findings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nicholas Murray Butler of Columbia University brought a report in July 1939 on returning from Europe . Hitler 's astrologists , Dr. Butler said , told him that the climax of his career would come in September of that year and that he should begin any major project at that time . The march into Poland and the most dreadful war in history did , of course , start . In September of this present year , Lieutenant-Commander Walter M.  | Wynne , a retired American naval officer , read a paper before the Chicago convention of the American Federation of Scientific Astrologists . Commander Wynne disavowed any validity for horoscopes , he said . It was clear , however , that Hitler believed in astrology . All of his swift and unexpected actions had been at times indicated as favorable by his horoscope . If only the British had bothered to consult Hitler 's horoscope , Wynne said , they would have been able to anticipate his thrusts ! Is there any basis for truth in the claims made by astrology ? This magazine has been investigating the subject for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many astrologers . Some of the astrologers were told in advance of the investigation ; others were not notified at all . The most eminent and the most sincere of these astrologers conceded from the outset that the procedure being adopted by the magazine was a fair one . Several of them were invited to meet various editors of the magazine and said , after their conferences , that the investigation was in every respect honest and sincere . A number of individuals not associated with the magazine were delegated to have their horoscopes cast by astrologers in different cities . In a number of cases the same people were directed by the magazine to different astrologers in order that the several horoscopes for any given individual could he compared . In the course of this investigation the magazine has consulted textbooks on astrology , astrological magazines going back over a long period of years , and clients of well-established astrologers . In the course of its investigation the magazine has consulted astronomers and psychiatrists and physicians . In its strict endeavor to be incontrovertibly fair the editors of the magazine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announced for the August 1940 issue , because the findings at that time were so entirely one-sided . The editors felt that additional time was necessary in order to permit the astrologers , themselves , to present for themselves such further evidence as they could . In an effort to raise astrology to a higher level of acceptance , a group of astrologers fairly recently organized themselves into a guild ? the Astrologers ' Guild . Apparently the object was to keep out " obvious " frauds . To the president of this Astrologers ' Guild the magazine submitted this proposal : that he select four reputable practitioners of astrology , each to cast the horoscopes of two persons to be selected by the editors . Data covering sex and birthplace and hour of birth were to be furnished . Each astrologer then was to be assigned a separate room for his work , with a court stenographer present to record every spoken word . The announced purpose of this test was to compare the findings of the several astrologers . The magazine agreed to publish the findings , regardless of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for such a test , including fees for the astrologers ' time . At the beginning , the president of the Guild professed to consider this a reasonable suggestion and offer . Later he reported difficulty in getting other astrologers to participate . Up to the moment of going to press , the challenge has remained unaccepted , and there has been no indication that it will ever be accepted . Astrologers who give personal readings and who have some personal following receive on the average a fee of ten dollars . They are considered the cream of the crop , though a few charge more , and once , in the boom days , some charged their clients up to $500 per consultation . Why did presumably intelligent businessmen pay such prices for astrological advice ? The conclision appears to be that an astrologer would advise Client A to buy certain stock in the market , and would advise Client B to sell the very same stock in the very same market . Thus in 50 percent of the cases the astrologer was bound to be right ; the client @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fool , and was ashamed to tell anyone of his experience . The client who won thought astrology was wonderful and told his friends and got more clients for the astrologer . How could the astrologer lose ! The mass market for astrology is covered by newspapers and magazines and mail-order readings . One astrologer , who offered a " complete solar horoscope and reading " for a dollar , ultimately received 30,000 replies enclosing dollar bills . The horoscopes he sent out cost him less than 3 cents each . He bought them in lots of a thousand from a Midwestern supply house that performs similar services for a list of probably 1000 mail-order astrologers throughout the country . These charts mean absolutely nothing ; but millions of them are distributed annually . Whether received by mail or seen in newspapers or magazines , their predictions are couched in the vaguest and most general terms . They bear not the slightest relationship to facts . The head  | of one of the larger astrology magazines . offers a 5-cent printed reading , which , viewed along with known facts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual horoscope " ? for $5. you give exact data on birth , you will analyzed by " one who understands you and can be relied upon to give you the truth . " Detailed help " concerning money , marriage , health , and occupation " offered , and it is advertised as " the most complete interpretation of your nativity at any price . " For the $5 duly forwarded I received a mimeographed letter and a booklet of approximately 50 pages , also mimeoaraphed . The horoscope itself appeared to have been filled in in handwriting . This " individual horoscope " told me I have unusual talents as a mimic , that - social service , medicine , and nursing were possible " for me . It stated also that I am qualified for " diplomacy , politics , research , and confidential positions . " Also that I can combine " scientific ability with intuitive understanding . " ASTROLOGY magazines sell for from 10 to 25 cents and abound in advice on almost every imaginable subject . Husbands and wives submit their marital problems . Medical advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , declared one magazine , it was unsafe to submit to intestinal and abdominal operations between the 1st and 3rd . From the 7th to the 9th , hip , leg , or arm operations would be dangerous . From the 16th to the 19th , operations on the eyes and teeth were to be shunned . The same publication gives a day-to-day schedule of the best days for sharpening tools , exterminating insects , and performing other chores around a farm . One peculiarity of the astrology magazines is that they fail to agree ; but that does not seem to be important , since few people read more than one astrology magazine . Let us take a typical case . One magazine says to the reader born at a given time and place : " Do not be arrogant or proud . Avoid reckless ventures . Take it easy . " A competitive magazine advises the very same person to " put zest , ambition , and imagination " into his work . Another typical case : Magazine A advises a woman : " This is a day for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advises her for the same day to " hold back on ambitious projects . " The best-publicized astrologer on the Pacific Coast predicted that Hitler 's death by assassination would occur early in 1940 ; he stated also that the Maginot Line would remain impregnable . One of the astrology magazines stated in November of last year that France would fight through to a decisive victory and would " resist to her utmost the signing of an armistice or overtures of any kind . " Former Premier Daladier , said another leading magazine in January of this year , was " France 's man and there is ( sic ) no two ways about it . " France was " behind its government and ... the people will support the Premier . " Not often , however , do the magazines venture specific opinions . When they do , they may be depended on quite as much as those quoted above . " If you do n't think there is anything to astrology , " asked one successful astrologer , " why do you suppose one of  | the air lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pilots up of keeps them grounded accordingly ? " We did n't suppose ; we investigated . No air line makes any use of astrology The proponents of astrology can not very well claim that they have had n , time to prove their case . Astrology goes back thousands of years , and once was as respectable as its twin , astronomy The brothers parted company , however Astronomy became an exact science with exact measurements and with a mathematical basis . Astrology faded into the mystical . In the course of the centuries its advocates have been challenged repeatedly to offer evidence that impartial people can accept . Tests were easily possible . Data might have been collected in the maternity hospitals in the large cities twenty years ago . Horoscopes might have been drawn for children born at the same time in those cities and their future progress observed . But no such experiment has come to our attention , nor are we aware of any now being undertaken . Any of the horoscopes cast for our investigators could be taken as typical . But let me cite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astrologer , I am inclined to be ruthless with women and dominate them quite thoroughly . This was pleasant to hear , though the truth is precisely the reverse . From August of 1940 to July of 1941 , said the astrologer. conditions were favorable for new enterprises , for branching out in business . After that ? trouble . I told her I had a business opportunity in England . but could not get away until January of 1941. and asked if my horoscope indicated any particular peril . " It would be better if you went right away , " she said . " But I thought you said the period from now until next summer would be good for new enterprises . " " Not for travel , " she said . I WAS asked for my wife 's vital statistics , which I supplied , and for those of my children . After some figuring , the astrologer decided my wife and I were both inclined to appendicitis . Neither of us has had any trouble in that direction . Well , she said , we 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was certain we are bothered with nervous indigestion ? which we are not . Please note that this astrologer is one of the most successful in the business . My next astrologer , also one of the highest rated , decided I had a hobby that occupied a vast amount of my time . He decided wrong ? I have no hobby at all . I asked him whether he could see any trouble ahead for me . None , he said . " Should I undertake a project lasting , say , two years ? " " Yes , " he said . In view of what the previous astrologer had said , this made me feel better . One of the more highly regarded men in astrology accepted cheerfully a challenge to cast the horoscopes of five persons whose birth information was to be furnished by the editors . The complete data ? which , along with all other data in , his investigation , will remain on file in he offices of Goon HOUSEKEEPING ? was almost entirely wrong . Typical miscalcuations : manual dexterity attributed to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicated for a man who actually has an independent income aside 96 from his salary of $16,000 a year ; doribed as inclined to illness a woman v.-ho is robustly healthy . In no single instance did any astrologer , to person or by mail , cast a horoscope for . ny investigator that was even remotely accurate ; in no single instance did the Investigation uncover any person anywhere who ever at any time received From an astrologer information more re.able than that reported in this article . no single instance was any astrologer und who could point to a client whose experience was otherwise . But one verdict is possible on the evidence , which could be presented endlessly . It is not only this magazine 's verdict . " The fallaciousness of astrology , " according to Professor John Q. Stewart , Princeton astronomer , " ceased to be debatable three hundred years ago . " " If there were any basis for astrology , " stated Professor Frank Schlesinger , Director of the Yale Observatory , " astronomers would be glad to know of it . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have come to the conclusion that there is no basis for its claims . " " Astrology is the bunk , " declares Dr. Morris Fishbein , editor of the Journal of the American Medical Association . " There are no good doctors who use astrology in any way , shape , manner , or form . " " I do not think any psychic researcher n the past fifty years has given attention to the claims of astrology , " said Dr. Walter Franklin Prince , research officer of the Boston Society for Psychic Research , " and has not definitely cast the pretended science on the dust heap . Astrology is always , in every way , a delusion and a fraud . " THEN why does astrology make an impression at all ? Because people ? even intelligent people occasionally ? are gullible . Very often it is fun ? enjoyable . People like to hear about nothing so much as themselves . When you consult an astrologer , he talks about nothing but you . Enough claims are made by an astrologer to cancel one another . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , forget those that miss the mark . If an astrologer mentions ten traits that you do n't have and one that you do have , your impulse is to say , " My goodness , if he knew that , there must be something to astrology . " Many people are susceptible to astrology because some astrologers are indeed sincere and others seem sincere . If something goes wrong with a horoscope , the astrologer says , " Do n't blame astrology ? blame me , my interpretation was at fault . " That 's rather disarming . You say , ' He 's quite an honest fellow . " Astrology can be dangerous . Susceptible people may find it hard to live withbut it , making every plan and every move according to a horoscope . It can become druglike in its effect . It can rob one of the will to live by will power . It is an opiate . There is no harmless opiate . It is no science . It has no scientific basis . The financially successful astrologers past horoscopes as ludicrous and misleadng @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't agree with one mother . Astrology , we find , is nonsense . There s nothing to astrology .
