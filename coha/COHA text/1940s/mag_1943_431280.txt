 | OF NEW ENGLAND 'S many rivers the Connecticut alone runs the full length of that rich and historic land . On the map it stands out like a giant blue artery in the very heart of its region . Indians named it the " Long River , " and today the far reaches of the Connecticut extend through a valley that is a cross section of northeastern America , so amazing is the variety of diversified human interests . In its long southward journey from the border of Canadian Quebec to Long Island Sound , the river goes through a thousand changes in size , width , depth , surface , pace , mood , and surroundings ( map , page 405 ) . For centuries the Connecticut has given life . True , it takes life away because from time to time , as far back as human records go , it has burst forth , in paroxysms of terrible rage , to destroy all that stood in its way . But men soon forget . Besides , they can not live without the river or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performs too many functions in the four States so much of which it dominates . The settlement of the rich fields , or intervales ( page 407 ) , of the Connecticut Valley in the 1630 's by land-hungry and freedom-seeking groups from Massachusetts Bay was the beginning of the westward movement of English colonists in the New World . For centuries bands of Indians worked their way up and down the river in canoes : later , white settlers moved up in the same way . Then through the years came towns , industries , cities , highways , and railroads ? all attracted to their location by the necessity of being near the river itself . New Hampshire , Mother of Rivers It is in a wild , rugged , heavily wooded and mountainous region in the extreme northern tip of New Hampshire , mother of several large and useful rivers , that the Connecticut takes its source . Flowing nearly due south , between the ridges of the White and Green Mountains , with their narrow , steep valleys and rugged peaks , the highest in New England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , * and crosses Massachusetts and Connecticut , in which States the valley broadens out into low , fertile , level bottom lands . The Daniel Webster Highway , U S 3 , the main north-south route through the central part of New Hampshire , is today the shortest road from Boston to Quebec . Stand beside the highway a few feet north of the international boundary and you will see before you in this French-Canadian province a peaceful panorama of long-settled rural countryside , whereas behind you , in northern New Hampshire , there is only wilderness .  | On the left of the pass , well up on the mountain crest , a few hundred yards inside the United States , is a rough little tarn , or pool , reached by no trail and only with the aid of a guide . This is Fourth Connecticut Lake , where the river , mighty indeed in its lower reaches , has its very modest beginnings ( page 406 ) . From there it flows into Third Connecticut Lake , a larger body of water , to Second Connecticut Lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . From here , still very tiny but exceedingly turbulent , it leaps joyously downward toward the sea . First and Second were originally natural , like Third and Fourth , but have been dammed , first by a lumber company and then by the New England Power Association system . Also , until a few years ago the highway reached only to Second Lake : beyond were mere trails . Off the main highway there are still only trails , and guides are needed as much as ever : here is the back of beyond , utterly remote and solitary . Aside from lumbermen , the area is visited by practically no one except fishermen and hunters , who find accommodations in a few camps on First and Second Lakes . Bear and deer are hunted . A Sparsely Populated Pittsburg This is one of the most sparsely populated areas east of the Rockies . Pittsburg Township is the largest in New Hampshire , but has only 820 inhabitants . In Pittsburg hamlet one makes the acquaintance of Topsy , safe , with her many descendants , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed by a hunter , and Topsy was found , less than a week old . weighing six pounds and half starved , by the local storekeeper in June , 1935 . A highly  | trained deer , with many agreeable tricks , Topsy has appeared at numerous fairs and sportsmen 's shows . South of Pittsburg , on a side road , is the first wooden covered bridge that crosses the Connecticut , still a diminutive but brawling brook . This bridge serves only a single farmstead ( opposite page ) . The floods of 1936 and 1938 destroyed many of the picturesque old covered bridges in New Hampshire , Vermont , and Massachusetts , one county in Massachusetts alone losing ten such bridges . Fortunately , however , many remain intact . The White Mountains , highest and most impressive group in the northeastern United States , soon loom up on the left . One-third of the whole State of New Hampshire has an elevation of two thousand feet . For many years after the Revolution the Connecticut Lakes region was claimed by both Canada and the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formed their own government , " The United Inhabitants of Indian Stream Republic , " with constitution , council , assembly , courts , and army . This tiny republic lasted for three years , and then the New Hampshire militia took over the territory . But Indian Stream is still there , crossing the main highway . In early days one of New England 's important industries was the driving of logs from the forests in upper New Hampshire and Vermont down the river as far as Holyoke and Hartford . But the railroad and motor truck changed all that . This historic custom has been resumed , however , on a few short stretches of the river . But the visitor will be more impressed by the vast quantities of logs stored at places in the river or its tributaries , especially at Groveton . Essex County , most northeasterly in Vermont , is as wild and primeval as Coos County ,  | New Hampshire , which embraces the Connecticut Lakes . But the wilderness is behind when Lancaster , county seat of Coos , is reached . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marveled that the forests and mountains of this north country could produce so many thousands of sturdy farmers , farmers ' wives and children , self-reliant and intelligent . Whitefield , a few miles beyond , has superb mountain views , but strikes a still different note with its smart resort hotels and the Chase Barn Playhouse . The owner , a former New York City music critic , has filled his barn with a startling variety of theatrical equipment , including one hundred red-plush seats from the Metropolitan Opera House . The Maple-sugar Capital A few miles above where the Passumpsic enters the Connecticut , St. Johnsbury , principal town in northeastern Vermont , neatly bestrides three stream valleys and their intervening hills . Only town of its name in the United States , St. Johnsbury is the maplesugar capital of the Nation ( Plates V , XIII ) . Also , because of the invention there in 1830 of the platform scale by Thaddeus Fairbanks , the little town has exerted an influence upon human welfare out of proportion to its size . The balance was used in Egypt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the young St. Johnsbury inventor decided he must have a better method of weighing wagonloads of hemp , and thus introduced the commercial manufacture of weighing machines . Fairbanks scales are still being made in St. Johnsbury , partly in buildings used for that purpose for more than a century .  | Thaddeus , who continued to invent until the age of ninety , together with his two brothers founded and long supported St. Johnsbury Academy , which accomplished its centennial in 1942 , to be celebrated in June , 1943 . A grandson of one of the three brothers is president of its board of trustees . At this school Calvin Coolidge prepared for college . Maple sugar , I had always thoughtlessly supposed , somehow found its way directly from the farm to the breakfast-table pancake . True , maple trees are tapped for sap on thousands of farms in Vermont , New York , Ohio , and Canada . But the actual manufacture and distribution of maple products is done largely by the Cary Maple Sugar Co. , of St. Johnsbury . Back in the eighties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Portland , Maine , wholesale house , had to take 1,500 pounds of maple sugar in payment for a sale of groceries . Fortunately , he was able to resell it to a tobacco manufacturer for sweetening , and thus began the use of maple sugar in plug tobacco , smoking tobacco , and cigarettes . Other important commercial uses are for confectionery , blended syrups , and ice cream . The problem now is to find young people to stay on the Vermont farms to tap the trees . The hurricane of 1938 * destroyed a considerable number of all maples . A few miles below St. Johnsbury on the main river is F. D. Comerford Dam at Fifteen Mile Falls , the largest hydroelectric development in New England . Such power as New Hampshire and Vermont fail to use is carried over a long transmission line to Boston . Much Remains of Unspoiled Beauty We have left the wilderness country pretty well behind by now , but the whole length of the Connecticut River retains a remarkable degree of unspoiled beauty , despite the development of cities , railroads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relatively small area , except for **28;230;TOOLONG , and almost everywhere the distance east or west from any large community to the unspoiled hills is very short . In this New Hampshire-Vermont reach , especially , the sides of the valley rise or spread away in a series of great intervales , or terraces , noted for their geologic perfection of form and beauty . Among the many examples are those in Newbury , Bradford , and Westminster , Vermont ; Haverhill , Orford , and Hanover , New Hampshire ; and Northfield , Massachusetts . Another characteristic of the river is the way it meanders , in great sweeping , now almost tortuous , but always majestic bends or curves . At times the bend takes the form of a gigantic S or U , the latter known as an oxbow ( Plate I ) . The terraces are put to different uses : the lowest to industry or dairy cattle or intensive agriculture ; the next to business , where there are any towns or cities , and the higher still to residence . In Orford , New Hampshire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another and higher natural terrace of the prehistoric river bed , known as the " Ridge , " on which stands a row of capacious and stately white mansions , bespeaking the quiet elegance of an earlier day . Among early American students of steam navigation is Samuel Morey . He launched a steamboat at Orford , in 1793 , at Sunday morning " meeting " time to avoid jeers from the crowd in case of failure , 14 years before Fulton 's Clermont made its first trip . Morey also invented one of the first steam engines . Dartmouth Born in a Log Hut South of Orford , on a terrace high above the pine-bordered , swift-flowing river , is Hanover , seat of Dartmouth College . One of the oldest , largest , and most prominent of distinctively men 's colleges , it grew from a single log hut of the Reverend Eleazar Wheelock 's charity Indian school ( Plate XI ) . Hanover is Dartmouth and Dartmouth is Hanover . Town common and college campus , deep and elm-shaded , are one and the same . The business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street , leaving the rest of the village to spacious college grounds , dignified college buildings , and homes . Despite the presence of a thousand naval officers taking an indoctrination course , Hanover was , at my last visit , still a world of its own . The college operates under the State of New Hampshire 's recognition of a charter granted in 1769 by George III . In 1816 the State Legislature tried to change the name to " Dartmouth University " and to remove the trustees . Dartmouth 's famous alumnus , Daniel Webster , carried the case to the U. S. Supreme Court and won a decision of historic significance because of its effect in guaranteeing the inviolability of contracts and charters . On the east side of the common is Old Dartmouth , reproduction of the original building erected in 1784 and destroyed by fire in 1904. 408 The National Geo  | On the north side of the green , at the heart of the campus , is the impressive , relatively new Baker Memorial Library , where one thousand men can study comfortably at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rises so high that it seems to stand for learning throughout the upper Connecticut Valley . Covering the walls of the great basement study hall are the vivid and startling murals of Jose Clemente Orozco , Mexican artist . They were painted in 1932-34 to symbolize the story of civilization on the American Continent , and are viewed annually by thousands of visitors . When completed , the composition was the largest fresco project in the United States , covering three thousand square feet of wall space ( Plate XII ) . Although Dartmouth is essentially an undergraduate college , it has three graduate schools , including the fourth oldest medical school in the country . Research for Better Vision Connected with the medical school is the Dartmouth Eye Institute , an outstanding research and clinical center . Among other things , it has devised tests to indicate whether the patient sees things where they really are , as people often have an inaccurate idea of the position , size , or contour of an object . The research work of the Institute deals chiefly with that part of the visual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . More than 8,000 persons have been examined in a single year . Research is carried on in the historic old Rufus Choate House , and to the layman the apparatus for diagnosing these defects is the ultimate in ingenuity and weirdness. * Nearly 20 miles south of Hanover is a scattered settlement on wooded hills known as the " Cornish Colony , " made up of artists and other celebrities . Nearly all of these fine estates face on Ascutney Mountain , across the river in Vermont , a graceful isolated peak that towers conspicuously over the scene . In the first decade of the 20th century the colony , one of the most noted of its kind , centered around the personality of Augustus Saint-Gaudens , the sculptor ( Plate VI and page 404 ) . His home , studios , garden , and lands are open to the public in the form of the Saint-Gaudens Memorial . The two studios contain reproductions in marble , bronze , and plaster of practically all his famous works . During the summers of 1914 and 1915 the former Harlakenden House , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of his historical *novels , was occupied by President Wilson . Near Mr. Churchill 's present home and on a peaceful , lofty hilltop is that of Maxfield Parrish , mural painter and illustrator . We found him waiting for us in the doorway , not of his studio but of his well-equipped machine shop , through which we had to go to reach the studio . Mechanics are Mr. Parrish 's joy and relaxation , and even in his work he carefully follows the scientific methods of the engineer in laying out the most fanciful of his creations . Another example of his methodical procedure is that he cuts up the NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC MAGAZINE to file away the illustrations for future reference . Windsor , Cradle of Machine-tool Industry To cross the river from Cornish to Windsor , the birthplace of Vermont , one must pay a small toll on the longest covered bridge in New Hampshire or Vermont . A bridge was built on this site in 1796 , and the present structure has stood since 1866 , despite destructive floods . It is recorded that 14,084 sheep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orderly-appearing little place whose historic importance is often overlooked . Until the Revolution , what is now Vermont was known as the New Hampshire Grants , although claimed by New York . Seventy-odd delegates met July 2-8 , 1777 , in what is now known as the Old Constitution House , still standing on North Main Street , and , after asserting Vermont 's independence , framed and adopted an epoch-making constitution . Vermont was the first State to provide for full manhood suffrage which was not dependent upon property , owned or rented , or a specified income . Vermont 's constitution also was among the first to prohibit slavery in express terms . To no little extent , the American machinetool industry , vital to modern civilization as well as production for war , had its start in remote and secluded Windsor . As early as 1828 Asahel Hubbard invented and began the manufacture in Windsor of a hydraulic pump , obtaining iron ore at Tyson , five miles from Plymouth , where Calvin Coolidge was born . Hubbard and his long train of Windsor inventor-successors of the National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rifle and to making machinery for manufacturing rifles . Pioneer conditions made firearms a household necessity , just as the automobile has been  | in this century . One marked improvement came in 1835 when Hubbard 's future son-inlaw , Nicanor Kendall , designed an underhammer rifle after he had tried to shoot a squirrel while riding in a sleigh , with the result of wounding himself and sending a bullet through the bonnet of his bride-to-be . Later , Richard Smith Lawrence and Frederick Webster Howe built an amazing variety of machine tools to manufacture rifles for the Mexican and Crimean Wars . Also there went forth from the Windsor group of **30;260;TOOLONG men who helped to develop the Winchester rifle , Smith &; Wesson revolver , and other major New England products . Windsor still has factories , but its historic National Hydraulic Company long since gave way , like a good ancestor , to offshoots famous in the world of machinery . The most direct of these is the Jones &; Lamson Machine Company in Springfield , Vermont , 13 miles south of Windsor , on the Black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from its sources of raw materials or markets , and not even on a main-line railroad , this little Vermont town is still one of the country 's leading machine-tool centers. iat It has the advantage of quality in its skilled workmen , many of whom own their farms and are native to the soil . I was told that three generations from one family were working in the plant at the time of my visit . A four-generation group had worked there a year before . A single resident of Springfield , the late James Hartness , onetime Governor of Vermont , distinguished amateur astronomer , and long president of Jones &; Lamson , took out 119 patents , usually at the rate of from two to ten a year . He set up in business for themselves ambitious young mechanic-inventors from his own shop . Although navigation has long since disappeared from the upper and middle reaches of the Connecticut River , it was a major highway of commerce in early days , despite many rapids and shallows . The Indians had long used canoes from Barnet , Vermont @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and settlers had no other thoroughfare . William Pynchon , founder of Springfield , Massachusetts ( page 423 ) , and his son John shipped thousands of beaver skins and much corn , wheat , and pickled meat down the river to England . Nearly all the 100,000 settlers who entered New Hampshire and Vermont from 1760 to 1790 ascended the river by canoes or flatboat ! As early as 1792 there began a feverish building of canals and locks around the many rapids , the Connecticut being one of the first rivers in America to be improved in this way . Bellows Falls Canal Still Operates Bellows Falls , next Vermont town on the way south , still has in operation the first of these canals . Today it is used for a power installation instead of for navigation . The concern which built the Bellows Falls canal in 1792 bore the quaint name of the " Company for Rendering the Connecticut River Navigable by Bellows Falls . " Up to 1839 as many as 8,000 tons of freight in a single year were carried through the canal . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there appear on both sides the towers of the Northfield Schools , educational-religious center founded by the evangelist Dwight L. Moody . These schools claim that their combined enrollment constitutes the largest private preparatory institution in the United States . They were pioneers in the field of student participation in housekeeping and farming as a phase of school life . Leaving its green fields briefly , the river flows for a mile through a narrow , rocky gorge , makes a big curve to the westward , and turns almost straight south again near Greenfield , shortly to be joined by the beautiful Deerfield River , pristine from its Berkshire hills . Thomas Carlyle said that " without tools man is nothing , with tools he is all . " Greenfield is a humming tool-making center , stripping the surrounding farms , service stations , and country stores of workers . But Greenfield specializes in small tools , such as taps , dies , gauges , wrenches , and drills , , instead of the complicated lathes , grinders , and gear shapers of Springfield , Vermont . The most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hoosac Range and then the Taconic Mountains into New York State , starts at Greenfield . Also , a few miles west of the city is the nearly five-mile-long Hoosac Tunnel , which , begun in 1851 , took until 1875 to complete . North of Greenfield agriculture is pretty well limited to dairy farming , important to the consumers of metropolitan Boston . But now the valley broadens out into very rich and level intervales which , until the rise of the potato empire of Maine 's Aroostook County , was the only large tract in New England where commercial farming could be conducted on the grand scale . Tobacco is raised in both the Massachusetts and Connecticut portions of the valley , and  | onions in Massachusetts . The tobacco is for cigar making and is among the best wrapper leaf produced anywhere ( Plate V ) . The huge and peculiarly shaped barns look , in the distance , like crouching prehistoric monsters . Much of the crop is grown under immense areas of mosquito netting ; hence " shade-grown . " Old Deerfield , a Colonial Gem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gem out of New England 's mellow past . Perhaps no colonial settlement suffered more from Indian massacres than Deerfield . It was almost completely burned by the Indians in 1675 and again , except for one house protected by snowdrifts , in 1704 . But it was rebuilt so sturdily that some twenty houses erected before the Revolution still stand on its mile-long street , over which arch the great spreading elms , almost untouched by the hurricane of 1938 . Most of the ancient houses are owned by Deerfield Academy , one of the oldest and best known of the country 's boarding schools for boys . More modern buildings are hidden from the " Street " enough to avoid disturbing its venerable , almost dreamlike atmosphere . Now used as a dormitory for younger boys , the John Williams House ( 1707 ) is notable for its various structural precautions , not only against witches but against further Indian raids . The Reverend John Williams was captured once and later " redeemed . " Worth seeing is the grave of his two wives , the first , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Indians , or , as the inscription expresses it , " fell by the rage of Ye Barbarous Enemy . " The first large town below Greenfield is Northampton , home for many years of Jonathan Edwards , famous in the early 18th century as preacher and theologian , and later of Calvin Coolidge , thirtieth President of the United States . The second-story window of Coolidge 's law office , on Main Street near the railroad station , still carries his name . The Connecticut River makes a big bend to the west above Northampton and then , before it reaches the city , an equally wide sweep through the fertile Hadley fields to the east . Northampton , with its tree-lined streets , spreads comfortably over its terraces . On one of the upper levels , Smith , among the largest residential colleges for women in New England ( Plates II , VII ) , stretches along the shores of Mill River and Paradise Pond . Tradition has it that the name of the pond derives from an appropriate remark made by of New England 419 Jenny Lind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1852 . Sophia Smith , a spinster in near-by Hatfield , spurred on by a conscientious young clergyman , the Reverend John Morton Greene , bequeathed her fortune , inherited from a brother , to found the college , which opened in 1875 with 14 students . Now given over in part to the WAVES ( Plate XIV ) , Smith is noted for its cottage system . There are no large dormitories but numbers of houses instead , some old and some new . None accommodates more than 70 girls . Oliver Smith , uncle of Sophia , shrewd and successful cattle fattener and Wall Street speculator , left to Northampton and seven nearby towns one of the most remarkable charities in America . For nearly a hundred years the Smith Charities have indentured boys to farming and girls to household work , providing them with $500 and $300 apiece , respectively , at the end of the apprentice period . In addition , $50 gifts are made to widows and the same amount to women between the ages of 18 and 45 who are about to marry . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eight towns . In addition , the Smith Charities support a trade and agricultural school . Although Oliver Smith left only $400,000 in 1845 , the total fund is now almost $2,000 , - 000 , despite the payment of large sums to many thousands of recipients . In 1941 , for example , 233 widows received $50 each and 466 young women received marriage gifts of the same amount . Oliver Smith was a bachelor and his nephews and nieces tried to break his will , retaining Rufus Choate . But Daniel Webster for the trustees won the suit . Mount Holyoke , Pioneer Women 's College Below Northampton the river passes between Mount Holyoke and Mount Tom , two impressive peaks in the Holyoke Range of jagged hills , which , running athwart and rising abruptly from the level plain , have all the appearance of actual mountains . A favorite pastime hereabouts is to " walk the Range . " Below the Range and east of the river in the peaceful village of South Hadley is Mount Holyoke College , one of the oldest institutions for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of women 's colleges . It was founded in 1837 by Mary Lyon , pioneer in women 's education . Unlike Sophia Smith , Mary Lyon headed her own institution , taught there for many years , and is buried on its beautiful campus . These words of hers are inscribed on her simple tomb :  | " There is nothing in the universe I fear but that I shall not know all my duty , or shall fail to do it . " Hadley , across the river from Northampton , is an old agricultural settlement . On one of its broad streets is the site of the Reverend John Russell 's home where , for 15 years , in what was then the remote frontier , two of the regicides , judges who condemned Charles I to death , were hidden and protected from the avenging agents of a restored monarchy . Beyond Hadley lies Amherst , crowning a gentle slope and rimmed about with hills . It is a spacious and serene educational center , the seat of the State College and of Amherst College . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefactor , religious denomination , or State , but by the people of the valley who wanted their sons to have an educational background for the ministry . Through the years the college has broadened , and its graduates include an unusually high percentage of men distinguished in the professions and education and in public life and affairs ( page 421 ) . Most colleges are engaged in various types of war training , but when Amherst was visited last autumn its most unusual activity was the large campus labor squad , which may be said to repay in part the farmers who in 1821 came in with horses , wagons , lumber , and stone to build South College , still standing and in use ( Plate XI ) . Near-by farmers of today , some of whose operations in tobacco , onions , potatoes , apples , and roses are on a very large commercial scale , face disastrous labor shortages . College students , including those from wealthy families , respond in squads to the farmer 's appeal , taking such pay as he may care to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education . " In Amherst 's museums are the Audubon collection of birds and the famous Hitchcock collection of footprints of giant reptiles which walked the valley eons ago ( page 406 ) . The Barrett Gymnasium , used from 1860 to 1884 , is the oldest college building now standing that was built as a gymnasium . Eight miles below Northampton the river makes a great bend around the city of Holyoke , drops nearly sixty feet , and feeds into a  | series of ingenious water-power canals which are nearly five miles long . They crisscross the city in three different levels and are still in active service , practically unchanged after ninety years . Writing Paper " Capital " Lining the canals are large paper mills , Holyoke being the country 's capital of fine writing paper , partly because of the unusually soft character of Connecticut River water . Several paper companies a r e still owned or managed by the original families that started the industry in the 1850 's . Springfield , named by stout-hearted William Pynchon ( page 417 ) for his home town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for some 300 years , largely because it stands at the natural junction of north and south routes up and down the Connecticut Valley and of east and west routes between Boston and the West . Despite the city 's age , few physical reminders of earlier years survive not a single house of the 17th century and only a few traces of the 18th . On the other hand , Springfield has an almost comfortable , leisurely quality , despite its 300-odd industries . Its factory buildings are widely scattered , not concentrated in a single district or area . Although Springfield was an Indian trading post to begin with , it soon proved a safe and convenient place for military stores and for recruiting troops for the French and Indian and Revolutionary Wars . All along Main Street artisans made and repaired muskets in their homes ; several of Washington 's victorious armies were equipped here . Thus began a great modern manufacturing center . The pattern was definitely set when the Armory , a Government arsenal , was officially established in 1794 . It has made approximately 35 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufacturing operations have continued uninterrupted for 149 years . During the Civil War 800,000 muskets were made and 3,000 men employed . Thomas Blanchard , inventive genius of the early 19th century , and John C. Garand , of the present era , are among those who have made mechanical history at the Armory . A few hundred yards from the Armory is 424 The National Geo  | a boulder which marks the spot where troops commanded by Gen. William Shepard repulsed the army of Shays 's Rebellion , which sought to raid the Armory stores in 1787 . Skates , Shotguns , and Postal Cards The chief characteristic of Springfield manufacturing is its extraordinary variety , past and present . In the sixties Ray &; Taylor were one of the country 's foremost manufacturers of paper collars . At one time the Barney &; Berry Skate Company made 100 , - 000 pairs of skates a year . Smith &; Wesson have made revolvers on a large scale since 1854 , and in near-by Chicopee and Chicopee Falls , respectively , are A. G. Spalding and Brothers , makers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , in addition to military weapons , has in the past been one of the world 's largest manufacturers of shotguns . Springfield boasts an old and important manufacturer of toys and games and is among the chief centers of the envelope industry , the Government having let its first postal-card contract to a local envelope concern . When Noah Webster , author of the famous dictionary , died in 1843 , the firm of G. &; C. Merriam , now more than a century old , bought out his heirs and has issued Webster 's Dictionaries ever since ( page 423 ) . Springfield is also the site of the work of the Duryea brothers , who pioneered and constructed the first practical automobile in America in 1892-93 . Their vehicle of 1892 and 1893 is in the National Museum in Washington , D. C. The commercial manufacture of motorcycles was begun and continued in Springfield by George M. Hendee ; it is now the Indian Motocycle Company . This company 's products are used by as many as 3,000 city , town , and county police organizations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present its production , like that of thousands of other concerns , is entirely military . In the last war motorcycles were used for communication purposes only : now they are combat vehicles . Springfield 's " cultural quadrangle " is a quiet little space almost in the heart of the city . It is surrounded by two art galleries , a natural-history museum , the Connecticut Valley Historical Society , the main building of the very active City Library , and by the Christ Church Cathedral ( Episcopal ) . The game of basketball was invented in Springfield , probably in 1891 , by Prof. James Naismith of Springfield College , which was founded for the training of Y. M. C. A. workers . Not far below Springfield , in Connecticut , is the Windsor Locks canal , 5.3 miles long , built in 1829 to avoid the Enfield Rapids , and the only one of the old canals still used for navigation . Occasionally a small pleasure boat goes through , only twelve in a recent year . Hartford a Shrine of Freedom Hartford , metropolis of the Connecticut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a far larger number of pleasure boats use this 52-mile reach to Long Island Sound than ever venture on the middle or upper reaches . Coal and oil are the only commodities transported in quantity , but their total has been large . Like Jamestown and Mount Vernon , Hartford is a shrine for patriotic Americans who believe in independent self-government in a constitutional framework . Adriaen Block , sailing out of New Amsterdam in 1614 , discovered the Connecticut River . The Dutch were first upon the scene , both at the mouth of the river and at the head of tidewater , the present site of Hartford , where they built a fort in 1633 . However , they failed to become permanent settlers . The English came in larger numbers , settled Wethersfield and Windsor , to the south and north , in 1634 and 1635 , to be followed the next year by the real founder of Hartford , the Reverend Thomas Hooker , who brought from Cambridge , Massachusetts , his immortal band of about a hundred men , women , and children , driving their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secession from the Bay Colony was the beginning of countless westward migrations of the English-speaking peoples from the coast . The motives of Hooker and his followers should not be invested with an exaggerated idealism . Land was getting scarce in the Bay Colony , and the level , fertile fields of the Connecticut beckoned . But Hooker was also more liberal and democratic than the theocratic rulers of the Colony , with whom he inevitably differed . When Connecticut Had a Pacific Coast At any rate , in 1639 the Connecticut towns voted the " Fundamental Orders , " based on a sermon delivered by Hooker in which he set forth that the " foundation of authority is laid . . . in the free consent of the people " and that the people also have power to set " bounds and limitations " on the powers of all officers and magistrates . These principles were reflected much later in the Declaration  | of Independence , the State constitutions , and the United States Constitution itself . In 1662 Charles II granted the Connecticut towns a very liberal charter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more independence than most of the other Colonies , but it was given land all the way to the Pacific Ocean . But James II did not share his predecessor 's views regarding self-government in the Colonies and sent Sir Edmund Andros to Boston to become governor of New England . In 1687 Andros arrived in Hartford and at a meeting of the Assembly demanded the surrender of the charter . Tradition has it that all candles were suddenly extinguished and the charter passed through the window to Capt . Joseph Wadsworth , who hid it in a great oak . Historical evidence to support this story is lacking . But Wadsworth evidently did hide and protect the charter in some fashion , because the General Court in 1715 awarded him twenty shillings for " faithful and good service , especially in securing the duplicate Charter of this Colony when our Constitution was struck at . " Storm Destroyed Charter Oak Both copies of the charter still exist , the better preserved one in the State Library , and the other mutilated , after its many vicissitudes , in the Connecticut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time for what it was , part of this copy was used as lining for a lady 's hat . The great tree , the Charter Oak , stood until it was destroyed by a storm in 1856 at an estimated age of 800 years . Portions of the Charter Oak are still kept as relics in many parts of the country . Modern Hartford is surprisingly metropolitan in appearance for a city of its size ( 166 , - 267 in 1940 ) , probably because so many massive " home office " buildings of insurance companies are scattered throughout the city , in some cases in beautifully landscaped grounds ( Plates III and VII , and page 420 ) . New York , not Hartford , is the insurance " capital " of America . But Hartford 's distinction lies in having headquarters of more than forty insurance companies without itself being a city of great size , this fact giving it a stamp of dignity and stability . Several important types of insurance were originated here . At present Hartford is one of the country 's foremost centers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East Hartford is the mammoth Pratt &; Whitney division of the United Aircraft Cor- poration . Also , alongside the river is Colt 's Patent Fire Arms Mfg . Co. , manufacturer for ninety years in Hartford alone of various types of guns for the Seminole , Mexican , Civil , Spanish-American , and the two World Wars . In addition , it has been a training school for many industrialists , inventors , and mechanics , including those who made Col. Albert A. Pope 's famous Columbia bicycle . Samuel Colt , a versatile and handy person , was among the popular lecturers of his day who gave laughing gas as a stunt to members of the audience . But he also invented the first practical revolving firearm , and on it took out his first American patent in 1836 ( Plate XIII ) . America 's use of interchangeable parts , without which guns , sewing machines , bicycles , typewriters , automobiles , and airplanes can not be produced in volume , did not begin in Hartford , but simultaneously near New Haven and Springfield , early in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the city , as well as one of the largest concerns of its kind in the world , is the Fuller Brush Company , widely known for its method of distributing brushes directly to the housewife through thousands of salesmen ( page 422 ) . Alfred C. Fuller , a Nova Scotia farm boy , who began in 1906 to take orders in the mornings and make the brushes himself in the afternoons and evenings in the basement of his sister 's house , is still head of the company . Hartford is full of picturesque contrasts between old and new , especially on Main Street . The most striking is that of the Old State House , built from the plans of Charles Bulfinch in 1796 , and Travelers Insurance Company tower , tallest structure in New England . Now a branch of the public library , the large , rambling house in which Mark Twain lived for so long is open to visitors , and contains many relics of the famous humorist . Near by is the home of Harriet Beecher Stowe , author of Uncle Tom 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trinity College are reminiscent of an older world . Adjoining Hartford on the south is the peaceful , elm-shaded residential town of Wethersfield , probably the oldest permanent English settlement in Connecticut and once an important center of foreign commerce . It has many old houses , but historically most interesting is the Webb House . George Washington and some of his generals spent four days there in May , 1781 , planning the alter-  | native campaigns against Clinton in New York and Cornwallis in Yorktown . Like Wethersfield , the little city of Middletown was once an important and wealthy West Indies shipping port , and long known also for its diversified industries . It is the site of Wesleyan University , which , despite its name , is not a " university " but one of the older of the small New England colleges of liberal arts and sciences . It was founded through the generosity and devotion of Methodists , but is in no sense sectarian or denominational . From Hartford the lines of transportation , population , and industry strike in a slightly southwestwardly direction past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But ages ago the river chose to take a different course . From Mid- dletown it makes an abrupt turn to the east and then flows southeast into Long Island Sound between Old Saybrook and Old Lyme Townships . The country through which the river runs beyond Middletown is as quiet , peaceful , and beautiful as in the upper New Hampshire and Vermont reaches , but naturally without the rigor of the north . The towns were hectic centers of shipbuilding a century and a half ago . Today they are small , dignified , sedate , and restful . Saybrook is one of Connecticut 's earliest settlements . It was founded as a refuge for aristocratic and prominent Puritans , and Oliver Cromwell is said actually to have boarded a ship with Saybrook in mind , but was prevented from sailing . Yale was founded on almost the same spot in 1701 , only to be removed to New Haven in 1717 . But the removal was not a peaceful one , for the Saybrook residents objected mightily , damaging the horses and carts sent to carry off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presidents of Yale College , in his famous and enthusiastic book , Travels in New England and New York , said that the Connecticut " may perhaps with more propriety than any other in the world be named the Beautiful River . " Such superlatives are difficult to justify , but no one who has followed the Connecticut from its northern mountain source to this last broad and placid stretch can deny that it is one of the most beautiful of rivers . Finally it flows past the two lighthouses at Old Saybrook , and , once the breakwater is reached , it ceases to be , lost in Long Island Sound and the ocean beyond .
