txt ? Sternly warning that the " war is going badly , " Ralph E. Flanders , head of the machine tool division of OPM and President of the New England Council , called upon Americans here today to match the war effort " sacrifice by sacrifice " of Britain and Germany . Addressing the Council 's 63rd Quarterly meeting at the New Ocean House here , Mr. Flanders asserted : " America must rule or be ruled , " and it should decide " here and now " that it will rule the air , since " air power will rule the world . " By that rule , it will " banish piracy and rapine from the air , the seas , and the lands of the globe . " " We are beaten , " he added , " and everything we stand for and hope for is beaten , if we stay in this conflict with our present halfhearted attitudes and policies . It is clear that without sacrifice we are lost . The time is not somewhere in the future . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in it , or get out of it . We must rule or be ruled . There is no alternative . " Government Failure Mr. Flanders , who is head of the Jones &; Lamson Machine Co. , of Springfield , Vt. , expressed particular concern over the Government 's failure to utilize all available machine tools for immediate aircraft production . " Believe it or not , " he told the meeting , " at a time when even days are precious , a large part of the new aircraft program will wait until new machine tools are built to equip new factories to build more machine tools to build airplane engines . And this occurs in a nation whose non-defense industries are all cluttered up with the needed tools , and in a nation whose Chief Executive has proclaimed a state of unlimited emergency ! " We can not wait for new-built factories and shiny new machinery . We must run all existing defense machinery clear around the clock , seven days a week . Nor is it merely defense machinery which must be operated , " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which can be shifted to produce arms and armament , airplanes and ships , must in part be run at the same full week of night and day operation , so as to release the remainder for the purposes of our offense . " Air power will rule the world , " Mr. Flanders asserted . " The question is , whose air power ? That question is almost decided . In a few months , perhaps in a few weeks , it will be decided . " Half-way Slogans Right now , he added , we must forget " business as usual , and a lot of other half-way slogans . Of course , we are going to aid Britain . If we are wise , we will aid her with a suddenness and a mightiness which will make the issue of her conflict successful beyond doubt . But we must see the task as something larger than ' putting out our neighbor 's fire , ' as the President once pictured it . The world is on fire , and the flames are lit here and there in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he continued , his air army must be defeated now , because " there is this about air power , that once attained , it is by any human means unconquerable . Ships travel slowly . Armies more slowly still . For a bombing plane , a thousand miles is a journey betwixt a late breakfast and an early lunch . " Guns and butter are symbols . Hitler told the Germans years ago that they must choose guns instead of butter  --  the expansion of arms and armament in place of comfortable living . Britain , as its choice , believed that it could hold to its social ideals and continue its social progress  --  guns in moderation , with plenty of butter for all . Britain did not have guns enough to save its butter . Now we have to make the choice , and this meeting of the New England Council is appropriate in time and place for us to come to our decision . " We should demand , " Mr. Flanders concluded , " that the Government give us more and greater tasks to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in-capacities . We should bring to bear upon our President the full measure of our comprehension and determination , so that he shall never again demand of us a half-measure of accomplishment . The people must lead ; and we of New England can lead the people , " Mr. Flanders declared . The organization of a non-profit foundation to assay New England 's natural resources and their development , and to foster new industrial products in and for New England , was announced by Dr. Karl T. Compton , president of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , and the Chairman of the New Products Committee of the New England Council . Sponsored by the Council . the new project will be known as the New England Research Foundation , Inc . And its purpose , according to Dr. Compton , will be to " study and appraise " such matters as : 1 ? Expansion opportunities for New England industrial concerns . 2 ? Possible extension into this area of industries now centered in other regions . 3 ? Possibilities offered by certain mineral resources as the basis of extractive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital groups in developing new inventions , promoting new industries , etc . " The need of such a permanent organization was emphasized in part , " Dr. Compton declared , " by the report submitted at the first annual meeting of the Council 's New Products Committee in November , 1940 . " And he revealed that articles of incorporation and by-laws already have been adopted and will be filed shortly with the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts . . Dr. Compton also announced that the Committee is now asking the public to contribute $100,000 to carry the fondation through its trial period . Eventually , he added , it is expected that the foundation will be wholly self-supporting . " In raising the initial subscription , " Dr. Compton continued , " it is felt desirable , as befitting the spirit of the foundation , to have a number of relatively small donations rather than a few large amounts . That is , in theory , " he added , " we prefer to have 100 contributors each subscribing an average amount of $1,000. "    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
