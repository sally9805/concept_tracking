txt The Chicago Merchandise Mart , world 's largest " store for stores , " is busily , planning for tomorrow while trying to ease the task of harassed store buyers today . Clothes for Jun:or and for his sister , for example , will fit better in the fhture , thanks to the Mart 's Merchandising Service Bureau . It has spent a great deal of time working with the Bureau of'rStandards and other organizations on a sizing project , now nearly ready for adoption . Children 's clothing , under this plan , will be sold by girth and height , rather than by age . That means a break for the short , chubby girl , or the tall , thin boy ; it will be better for the average-sized youngster , too . Through long - distance correspondence , the Bureauhas been guiding dozens of servicemen who think they want to get into retailing when they get out of the Army or Navy . It offers free advice on how to open a drygoods store , a gift shop , or even an interior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One medically-discharged veteran of 19 recently came in seelting to and out about " starting a little store in a small town where I wo n't have to see many people  --  because I have ulcers . " Mrs. Katherine Ratto , director of the Service Bureau , urged hiM to find out something about the business first . Helps With Store Designs Mrs .. Ratto and her aides - foresee a busy future in helping smaller stores design new buildings , arrange their merchandise , set up new departments and otherwise help promote sale of gobds . That 's routine service for the Bureau . For example , when Mrs. Ratto was visiting a shop in a small North Dakota town , the woman owner suggested she wanted to duplicate a chrome and black glass store front she 'd seen in Milwaukee . Mrs. Ratto discouraged , her , urged something more in keeping with her surroundings and directed her to a firm of store architects which could do the job . ? " It 's just my jack-of-all-trades mind , " Mrs. Ratto explains , when an amazed caller . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarks about her understanding of all phases of merchandising . She admits . however , that before taking this job - she managed a chain of retail stores , bought merchandise , kept stock , wrote advertising copy , wrote a fashion column for a large daily newspaper , kept books , designed store interiors and owned a specialty shop . Last year Mrs. Ratto 's Bureau handled between 12,000 and 15,000 queries . The staff explained the provisions of a multitude of C.P.A. and W.P.B. orders affecting retailing for perplexed buyers and manufacturers ; they suggested sources of merchandise  --  the Bureau has a file of where-to-buy some 15,000 items ? they gently prodded store owners to get out of a wartime habit of treating customers poorly . The Service Bureau is so adept at finding " bugs " in bookkeeping systems , the Department of Commerce has asked it to submit the simplest possible foolproof accounting system for incorporation into a booklet the Government will publish . Market Promotion Experts The Mart 's market-promotion experts are getting ready , meantime , to reestablish all their own pre-war attractions and set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more lunchrooms for busy buyers , free buses from , hotels to the big white building that houses the Mart , encourage various groups to entertain at dinner , dances and cocktail parties as they used to before merchandise became hard-to-get . Right now , however , Mart managers are wondering whether the Office of Defense Transportation will allow them to hold their usual summer " markets " on home furnishings , apparel , giftwares , pottery , glassware and china . These are the special shows held from time to time to attract retail buyers from all over the country ; last year 400,000 buying visits were recorded and some buyers dropped into the Mart without registering . Exhibitors ? at the Mart have kept their showrooms well filled with peacetime merchandise , even though many items can not be bought-today . They 've added a few post-war samples , too . They feel that buyers will remember such displays's-n*1 more vividly than empty showrooms and come bb.ck when highly competitive post-war - gelling-  gets under way . There will be more exhibitors after the war , too . Of hundreds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one day  --  new tenants will be selected.to round out the merchandise . selections offeredto buyers . Manufacturers of pots and pans , electrical appliances and apparel will have ? a slight edge in getting space ; the Mart ' management feels it is weakest in these lines . Just now the building is 99% rented  --  but 34% of the space is being used by nonmerchandising companies and Government bureaus which are expected to reduce their space at the war 's end . Manufacturers who do n't get permanent quarters will be urged to set up temporary displays and take orders for their goods during market periods . This will further increase the variety of items buyers have to choose from . Making ' Visitors Comfortable Attracting buyers to the Mart was a problem the management began to study long before the first tenant signed his - lease . They decided visitors were to be made comfortable , their shopping expeditions made simpler , and they were to have the best possible help in selecting their goods . First of all , the building was laid out so that buyers could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of item concentrated in one section , or group of sections . The eighth floor , for instance , was set aside for men 's apparel and the furniture people were located on the sixteenth and seventeenth floors . ? The sixth floor was ear-marked fora decorators ' paradise . Here are fine-furniture coinzanies that will cover a few pieces to order , clit-to-order drapery and floor covering houses that will furnish items for special interior jobs . There are shops where the decorator can buy as little bric-a-brac as he needs or possibly one lamp or two , in contrast with the shops on other floors where orders are placed by the dozens or by the gross . Then the management set aside space for luxurious lounees  --  there arc three of them now  --  where the buyer may check wraps and baggage , use the telephone or engage in discussions with other buyers . In addition , he can get'a shave , have dinner , buy a railroad ticket or get a plane reservation , buy about any , item he needs , in the 32 retail shops , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The building is air-conditioned to provide a comfortable place for shopping in the hot , muggy days . Because their windows are always closed , Mart , exhibitors do n't have the problem , of replacing displays soiled by the dirt and smoke from tt1e freight tracks of the Chicago and North Western Railway which runs right under the building . One wholeSaler located within a few blocks of the Mart estimates that railroad smoke costs his company at least $100,000 a year . Displays of light-colored merchandise become unusable after three weeks , he says . The Merchandise Mart was conceived by the late James Simpson , president of Marshall Field &; Co. , to provide a center where manufacturers in related ' lines could concentrate permanent salesrooms and displays for their merchandise during 52 weeks of the year . The Mart is operated by the real estate division of Marshall Field and Co . Its general manager is John C. Goodall . The corporate offices of this , Chicago 's largest department store , are located on one of the Mart 's top floors . Work on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of floor space , was started in 1928 on a site for which the company had purchased the " air rights " over the freight tracks of the Chicago and North Western . The first tenants moved in during April , 1930 , but the depression curbed manufacturers ' expansion plans . Occupancy of the Mart grew slowly at first , then by leaps and bounds during the late thirties and early forties until more than 5,000 lines are now represented , including 81 lines of fine furniture ; 91 lines of floor coverings ; 151. of curtains , draperies and fabrics ; 658 of china , glassware , pottery and gifts ; 456 lines of women 's , children 's infants ' wear and accessories ; 194 lines of men 's and boys ' wear and accessories ; as well as 469 lines of housewares , appliances , toys , games and wheel ' goods ; 121 lines of lamps , shades and lighting fixtures . Some 98% of the nation 's leading rug manufacturers are represented , and 75% of the leading makers of curtains , draperies and fabrics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mart for their goods . Others send orders to the factories to be filled . Excellent service is maintained for ? those who store their wares at the Mart . Freight lines with terminals at the Mart freight elevators run all the way under the building , and along the north half of the Mart are spacious ramps , landings and elevators to make freight handling by truck quick and easy . Eighty trucks may be backed up 10 the concourse which covers 102,000 square feet .
