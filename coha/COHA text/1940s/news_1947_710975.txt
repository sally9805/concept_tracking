txt Secrets of the earth 's crust are being ferreted out with airplane speed  --  literally ? in the global hunt for buried metals and oil . The hunters : major petroleum and mining companies , goaded by worldwide pressure for more oil . lead , iron . zinc and copper . The guides : specialized aerial survey companies , which have taken the prospector off his donkey and put him in a helicopter or a transport plane The weapon : the airborne magnetometer , or " flying eye . " whose sensitive nose records magnetic changes in underground rock makeup and tells the hunters where the prey may hide . The hunting grounds : underwater , mountainous and jungle spots , out of the way and out of the question for searches by foot or by boat . Quest in Canada Aero Service Corp of Philadelphia , for instance , has conducted and completed a largescale survey of difficult terrain in eastern Quebec . Kennecott Copper Corp. , one of America 's great mining concerns , had discovered ilmenite. the ore which yields valuable titanium-badly needed now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how far deposits in the area extended . Ground crews could survey only slowly , in the short summertime . The air survey offered speed . Now the task of development can begin . This same survey firm has wound up the first big commercial air survey of some 85.000 miles of shallow Bahamian seas . It may be three to five years before the mass of data gathered can be picked apart and put to use . Even then the hunters plan to stalk the hunting grounds which are shown most promising with other oil-probing weapons before bagging the game Aero 's clients on this exploration were csott nil Corp .. Standard Oil Co. , ( N Superior Oil Co . A.nglo-Iranian Oil Co. and Shell Oil Co In South America . Fairchild Aerial Surveys , Inc .. of New York is at work on a magnetic map of a 200,000 square mile a a in Venezuela and Colombia for Gulf Oil . This survey , the company hopes , will be wrapped up in a bundle of geophysical data by next February . Lundberg Exploration Ltd of Toronto . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Research Corp . of Denver , Col. , and the Geological Survey . U. S. Department of Interior , have also been active in air magnetometer work from Alaska to Antarctica and from the Gulf of Mexico to the Marshall Islands Quiet Competition Most of the commercia ' work has been sponsored by oil and mining companies in a hush-hush atmosphere of keen competition . ern Service Corp ' a first commercial job was for International Nickel Co. in Canada early this year . Beyond that , Aero people say that three projects in Canada for " major " U. S. and Canadian mining companies covered areas greater than 1.000 square miles eilich . Lundberg Exploration Ltd using a Bell helicopter instead of a conventional plane to carry magnetic instruments and recording gear , began its first commercial operation in October " So far . " says Hans Lundberg. president . " our paying jobs have been confined to metal and mineral exploration " He quails at naming the clients for his Canadian questing . In all , almost half a million square miles of the earth 's surface  --  more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the airborne magnetometer in the global search for oil and ore since 1944 . The U. S. Geological Survey alone has surveyed about 200,000 square miles in the U. S. and its possessions since April of that year . And the government is running routine surveys now at a rate of 75,000 miles a year " It wo n't be long . " says one oil company official , before most areas where the airborne magnetometer has practical advantages will be surveyed . In a few years it 's chief use will he in metal and mineral prospecting not oil . " But air explorers contend there 's ell ! plenty of work to do . Declares Homer Jensen , chief of Aero Survey 's magnetometer division : " In oil , we have just begun to get out of the United States and must certainly get into the Near East and the West Indies , as well as take part in the continental shelf exploration here and abroad . " Lundberg Exploration plans oil and mineral work in Europe . the Far East and Australia . And next year the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their oil and metal reserves The Science of It All The huh around which all this activity spins is the airborne magnetometer . The great magnet to which this instrument responds is the whole world . The earth 's entire surface has a magnetic field , which in general is moat intense at the poles and weakest at the equator But the field varies measurably from spot to spot . because the rocks near the surface differ in composition and structure Charting these differences gives vital clues to the nature of geologic strata , and scientists Cali draw conclusions about their oil and ore content Sometimes the evidence Is fairly direct ? as when iron-bearing magnetite ore reveals itself by a magnetic " high " But usually it Is circumstantial Oil possibilities may he indicated by meamurinp the depth of sedimentary rock laid down in an ancient sea over rock of volcanic origin . The likelihood of finding oil may be enhanced if it 's established that at cane point the sedimentary rock has been domed up by the " basement " rock beneath . Some air survey experts argue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deduced from the magnetic field in the rocks around them  --  though they agree this is " controversial . " The magnetometer is usually placed in a bomb-shaped shell and trailed by cable about 100 feet beneath and behind a plane , to avoid response to the aircraft 's own magnetic impulses . This " flying eye " or " bird " is t ** towed along a predetermined path P t altitudes of 500 to 1,000 feet at a clip of 15n miles per hour or more . In the nose of the bird is a detector element called a fluxgpte , no larger than a cigarette . which Is 1:cpt parallel to the earth 's magnetic field by a delicate gyro-mechanism . As the magnetic field varies in intensity , the changes are picked up by an alternating current imposed across the detector . Sharp pulses in voltage are detected , amplified and recorded . The recorded data is later transferred to Maps  --  a process requiring 20,000 man-hours for the Bahamas operation  --  and then sent off to the client whose specialists take over . A spokesman for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prospecting , points nut that the magnetic maps are subject to d fferent interpretations and two geologists examining the same chart may not agree . ' 1%iost companies still consider the surveys in the Bahamas and in South America as huge ? ? xnerimente . At any rate , since sinking a hole may involve a $1 million investment , oil companies plan to comb the most likely areas with conventional prospecting tools before drilling . Advantages Claimed Then why the airborne magnetometer ? James R. Balsley , Jr. , airborne geophysicist for the U. S. Geological Survey , answers with an example : " A four-man crew made a survey of 3,170 square miles in the Adirondack ! ' with flight lines usually a quarter-mile apart : a total of 11,300 miles of traverse . The cost of an equivalent ground survey with dip needle would be 17 times as great as the airborne and would have required 27 sixmonth field seasons with a four-man crew ? about 80 times the time required for the airborne survey . In addition , the ground survey would have been considerably less detailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he declares , " will by no means replace the usual surface instruments , but will certainly serve to delineate areas that deserve intensive work . " Aero Service Corp . ' s survey of the entire Bahamas area centered about a magnetometer developed by the Gulf Research &; Development Co. and is similar to a. device used by the Navy to spot enemy submarines during the war . The area mapped , larger than the state of Kansas , is about 10% land . 10% deep water and 80% water shallower than 25 feet Oil companies involved have already staked out their concessions , shared about equally in the cost of the project and will have equal access to the compiled data . Shoran Helped To guide survey aircraft over this vast area precisely , Aero Service Corp . employed another war-time device  --  Shoran . Shoran stations were set up aboard small boat , anchored in pairs about 30 miles apart . They provided continuous triangulation so a plane flying in the general area could tell exactly where it was . Existing charts of the Bahamas were found to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , spotted islands miles from their mapped positions , discovered a lighthouse six miles away from where it was supposed to be and on several occasions revealed that the surveying boats themselves should " properly " be on dry land , if the traditional charts were to be believed . A plane , a modified DC-3 two-engine craft of the sort used on airlines , made two daily flights of about six hours each . Each day it equalled a round-trip flight . New York to MlItInl . Two complete five-man crews operated the survey plane , alternating flights . The plane ate up more than 100,000 gallons of gasoline . In South America Fairchild Aerial Survey also using the Gulf magnetometer has wound up more than half its project for Gulf in Venezuela and Colombia , over an area four-fifths the size of Texas . Using two A-26 aircraft and Shoran mounted in jeeps , crews guide the planes along parallel " profiles " at a rate of some 10,000 miles a month . The jeeps move about the country as the survey progresses . One jeep in each team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trip of 700 miles at a stretch . Roads are bad , primitive river crossings frequent and jeep teams usually 80 to 100 miles apart . The recorded data is sent to Fairchild 's New York office . where magnetic charts are prepared for Gulf . Hans Lundberg 's airborne work started in Sweden in 1921 when he attempted magnetic work in a captive balloon . From there , he turned to gliders and once even tried to shoot skyward with , his instruments in a mammoth kite . The helicopter appeared to be a happier solution . " Using an instrument of our own design , " declares Mr. Lundberg. " we can conduct a survey of any size at 70 or 75 miles per hour for less than the cost of an airplane type survey . " He adds that flying close to the ground he can get better control .
