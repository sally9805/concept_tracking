It was no secret that the Pennsylvania Railroad Co. had lost money in 1946 . The only question was : How much ? Last week the Pennsy gave out the dismal figure : $8.5 million ( v. a net profit of $49 million in 1945 ) . Never before in its 100-year history had the biggest U.S. railroad gone into the red . <P> Like all other roads , the Pennsy had watched its revenues decline and its costs zoom since war 's end . Thus , while the Pennsy 's total 1946 operating revenue of $822 million ( down $114 million from 1945 ) set a new peacetime high , so did its operating expenses . <P> Too Little . For the Pennsy 's woes , President Martin Withington Clement had a two-word explanation : " Government regulation . " When rail workers were awarded an 18 wage increase in mid-1946 , it was made retroactive to Jan. 1 . But ICC delayed giving the railroads a 17.6% rate increase until last December . Furthermore , said Clement , additional boosts are necessary . <P> Partial justification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rail earnings reports for January . They showed freight revenues up a whopping 21.2% over 1946 ; but a drop of 39.5% in passenger revenues pulled the roads ' net increase down to an unimpressive 6.5% . Obviously , the industry 's problem was to jack up passenger revenues . <P> Too Much . For the most part , stick-in-the-mud railmen were counting on ICC to do this for them by boosting passenger rates-a dubious solution , because higher rates would probably mean a still smaller volume . A more likely solution was to woo passengers away from planes , buses , autos . <P> As passenger bait , Alleghany Corp . ' s Robert R. Young in January began offering travelers a pay-as-you-go service on the Chesapeake &; Ohio , complete with credit cards like those in use by airlines . Last week , 35 other roads announced that they would provide the same service , starting in April . <P> Bob Young had only begun to prod . This week , in the midst of his maneuvering to take over control of the giant New York Central , Young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secretary of State Edward R. Stettinius Jr . as chairman of an advisory committee representing the public , the Federation will be open to security holders , labor , shippers and anybody else interested in " revitalizing the industry .
