txt No capital in the world offers a target to the bomber as conspicuous as the Kremlin . This is a city within a city , the secret fortress of a Government which the Commissars of the People took over from the oldest and most absolute Czars . The high walls are broken by towers and turrets that jut sharply into the sky . Within the vast enclosure are palaces and churches crowned with spires and bubbling domes that are doubly reflected in a wide bend of the Moscow River . It would be strange if the German raiders failed to score a hit on this shining mark in their initial attack , as the Russians claim . The Nazis say that twelve bombs struck the " Kremlin area " and started fires in Soviet administration buildings . Whatever tb3 truth of these conflicting stories , eyewitnesses of the first raid on Moscow  --  quickly followed by another last night  --  agree that the Luftwaffe failed to inflict serious damage on the city or to demoralize the population . Apparently the hardy Muscovites bore their first ordeal by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflections of Joseph Stalin , supposing he kept vigil in the Kremlin while Hitler 's incendiaries rained death and destruction on the roofs of the Soviet capital ? Moscow was the last city that was expected to be bombed . Stalin had manoeuvred to turn the tide of battle away from Russia . He had plotted to insure the Soviet Union against involvement in a struggle which was to ruin the rest of the world and leave Russia immune from attack from any quarter and all-powerful when the belligerents were exhausted . If his thoughts turned back to another night in the Kremlin when he rubbed his hands in satisfaction as Ribbentrop and Molotoff signed the fatal pact that started the war , the first German bomb must have fallen on his ears like the crash of a great boomerang . Perhaps his citadel was unscarred , but Stalin sat nevertheless amid the wreckage of his policy and the ruin of his plans . The flares dropped on Moscow were the inexorable backfire of the shells that in days past exploded over Warsaw . The thoughts of Adolf Hitler could hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack on Moscow . For if he conceived the assault on Russia as a means of stopping the war in the west , if he hoped that his enemies would be diverted from their purpose provided he turned the full weight of his war machine on the Soviet Union , he must be cruelly disappointed to see that this grandiose plot has failed . The rumors of peace talk in this vein that spread in Ankara and other centers suggest that the Russian campaign , like all its predecessors , was undertaken in a final desperate attempt to end the fighting on Hitler 's terms . If this is true , and if the effect of the drive east is only to strengthen and encourage the forces of resistance , then the bombing of Moscow spells also the failure of Hitler 's policy . It signifies that there is no immunity from the consequences of his own ac- tions , and no end to this struggle or any terms that can be fixed is advance .                @ @ @ @ @
