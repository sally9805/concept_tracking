txt New England 's highest official representatives were busily engaged today in a new and determined effort to bring fuel relief to this region before winter sets in . Only 43 hours before the six New England Governors planned to leave for Washington to carry their fuel oil problems to President Roosevelt , Mayor Maurice J. Tobin of Boston returned from the nation 's Capital this morning with the promise that more tank cars would shortly be allocated to the six northeastern states . The Mayor obtained this assur- . ance from Fuel Co-ordinator Harold L. Ickes , with whom the Governors will confer before seeing the President . Mr. Tobin said he had received a definite statement from Mr. Ickes to the effect that " more oil tank cars will be diverted to New England immediately . " This appeared to presage a successful visit of the Governors to Washington , for they are concerned with obtaining assurances from the President and from Mr. Ickes similar to those given to the Mayor by the Fuel Co-ordinator . The Governors will leave for the Capital on - Oct. 12 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Conferences between the Governors and Mr. Ickes will start on Oct. 13 at 10 a. m. , and a subsequent conference will be arranged with the President which Mr. Ickes will attend as consultant . The President had previously termed the issue " a technical one " and hence one concerning the Governors and Mr. Ickes only . But additional appeals to the President from the Governors caused him to alter his stand and invite them to see him . The object of the Governors will be to have New England 's quota of fuel tank cars increased as near as possible to the region 's daily rationed requirements of 1,550 cars . Mayor Tobin declared that he had pointed out ? to Mr. Ickes the fact that New England was now receiving no more than 900 cars daily and that keen suffering can result from failure to build up local fuel supplies now before the demands reach their peak . The Mayor said he had also conferred in Washington with Massachusetts Congressmen , asking them to exercise their powers more forcibly in behalf of fuel relief . The Mayor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the Governors , William H. Wills of Vermont , will fly to Washington .
