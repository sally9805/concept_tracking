ESSAYS OF THREE DECADES ( 472 pp. ) - Thomas Mann , translated by H. T. Lowe-Porter-Knopf ( $4 ) . <P> <P> When Thomas Mann 's first great novel , Buddenbrooks , was published in 1901 , there still lived in Germany a nonagenarian schoolteacher who had talked not only with young Leo Tolstoy , but with old Goethe himself . Mann , who has published 36 books in his 72 years of life , cites this old schoolteacher as the 20th Century 's last physical link with the great world of Goethe , Beethoven , Mozart . But he does not suggest that that world 's principal literary descendant today is Thomas Mann himself . <P> In these 16 profound and erudite essays ( which are now collected in book form for the first time ) , readers will find themselves standing at the latter end of a span that covers 200 years of intellectual and social development , and stems from cultural traditions as old as the Renaissance . <P> Austere Symbol . Half the subjects of Mann 's essays are figures who are known to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Schopenhauer , Freud ) ; the others are likely to interest only a specializing minority . But there is no basic difference in Essayist Mann 's approach to any one of them - and it is this constancy that unites them in one volume like assorted vegetables in one string bag . <P> " Art , " says Mann , in one of his ecstatic outbursts , " is the most beautiful , austerest , blithest , most sacred symbol of all supra-reasonable human striving for ... truth and fullness " but it is also " only one humanistic discipline among others ; all of them , philosophy , jurisprudence , medicine , theology , even the natural sciences and technology . . . are only variations ... of one and the same high and interesting theme-man . " <P> In estimating the great men of his traditional past , Mann adopts the rare criterion that is characteristic both of himself and of the humane tradition : " Ironic reserve on the subject of ultimate values . . . that irony which glances at both sides . . . and is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; guided as it is by the surmise that in ... matters of humanity , every decision may prove premature . " <P> Ardor &; Judgment . It is Mann 's tolerant , middle-of-the-road approach to man that has infuriated extremists of Right and Left , who have denounced him as a prominent but typical bourgeois . But to Mann , this insult is a compliment , because he believes that it was precisely the bourgeois soil of the 18th and 19th Centuries that nourished the traditions he most admires . Goethe , a dutiful privy councillor of Saxe-Weimar as well as a world poet ; Tolstoy , a schoolteaching aristocrat who tried to look like a simple peasant-these men were cradled by the " bourgeois ideal of individual human universality . " <P> When Mann writes in this way of Goethe and Tolstoy , he is not arguing that they simply and naturally kept to the middle of the road . On the contrary , he sees them as men who spent most of their lives and will power struggling to discipline passionate " animal " qualities . Out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " came the synthesis most admired by Mann-a harmonious and exalted mixture of primitive ardor and civilized judgment .
