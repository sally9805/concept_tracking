The columnist was tattling on his trade . " Standard practice , " he wrote , " is to correct a wrong like ' Joe Blow is a crook ' by printing , as many days later as is safe , something that goes ' Do n't believe those things you hear about Joe Blow . . . . ' " <P> Columnist Herb Caen knew the usual trade practice : brag about your right guesses , if any , and maybe nobody will notice the others . One day last week he devoted his entire daily space in the San Francisco Chronicle to a recital of his April errors . Sample error : that fine little crack about the canned peas served at the national frozen-food convention banquet had been run without checking ; and it just was n't so . Caen promised to continue " Writing the Wrongs " once a month . " In the course of hacking together 20 or 25 items a day , " he explained to his readers , " I 'm sometimes . . . wrong . If that makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> He could easily afford to admit some boners . In the Bay area , parrot-beaked Herb Caen , 31 , has a more devoted following than any syndicated columnist , and in the Chronicle he far outdraws Drew Pearson and Billy Rose , the only outsiders Editor Paul Smith prints . Smith has found out what many papers could confirm if they only tried , : a good local column does n't have to be brilliantly written ( Caen 's is n't ) to outshine all the syndicators that money can buy . <P> Caen Is Able . Herb was a 20-year-old police reporter and part-time radio columnist for the Sacramento Union when his juvenile gibes at radio caught Smith 's eye in 1936 . When Smith interviewed him , Caen thought it wise to add three years to his age ( " I did n't know he was only 27 himself " ) . <P> Caen 's Chronicle column got off to a slow start , for conservative San Franciscans whose names were newsworthy did n't like to make Caen 's kind of news . Without benefit of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caen created a cafe society of his own . He haunted nightspots , cocktail parties and theater openings , built an army of volunteer tipsters . Unlike most of his Broadway rivals , Columnist Caen rarely had anything malicious to say about anybody . <P> While still new at the game , he wrote a naive item about some " hidden gambling dens " on Turk Street . Police raided the joints and the next night the gamblers asked Caen to come down for a drink . " I thought they were being good guys , " he says , " but they slipped me a Mickey . " Today he is more careful about the company he keeps . He makes $24,700 a year from the Chronicle and a weekly radio program for a beer sponsor ( titled What 's Brewing in San Francisco ) . He can afford to turn down handsome offers from Hearst 's rival Examiner , whose company he does not wish to keep .
