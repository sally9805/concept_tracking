I 'm an adventurer . I was present at the Gallipoli Campaign in the first World War . In the drying Turkish sun , on the burning beach , I made notes with a Jones pen . <P> After that and other similar recommendations this week hundreds of people must have been eager to buy the Jones Mystery Flow Fountain Pen . All credit for their eagerness belonged to the Lewis Brothers , Mort &; Lester . They waited 98 weeks for some sponsor to buy their NBC sustainer If I Had the Chance , which was written by Mort , ballyhooed by Lester . When nobody gave the show a break , Mort hopefully whipped up another called Behind the Mike , set Lester to work on its promotion . Designed to tell inside stories about programs and radio personalities , Behind the Mike is now aired over 85 stations and short-waved to Canada and South America . <P> Last week , in desperation , Mort Lewis put together a script designed to show what the program could do for a commercial sponsor . Behind the Mike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NBC handled its news , described famous fluffs made by radio announcers , interviewed Robert Gunderson , blind entrepreneur of a radio school , and it plugged hard for its sponsor the mythical Jones Mystery Flow Fountain Pen . <P> A trifle fearful of his own persuasive powers , Mort Lewis wondered this week what he would do if people pestered him for his mythical pens . He also wondered what he would do if his latest device did n't fetch a sponsor for Behind the Mike . Although he has served as scripteur for Burns &; Allen , Willie &; Eugene Howard , Olsen &; Johnson , many another team , he now writes only Behind the Mike and dialogue for Molasses &; January , who now flourish in the south and southwest . <P> Moonfaced , balding , bespectacled , Mort broods a great deal about his health . Year and a half ago , while skiing in the Adirondacks , he fell victim to snow blindness , now carries two pairs of dark glasses around with him at all times . Ever since a couple of thugs attacked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was removing his glasses , he has been taking jujitsu lessons . He experiments with jujitsu on his secretary and on Brother Lester . He tried it once on his new wife , principal of an elementary school in The Bronx , nearly broke her wrist before she could say uncle .
