txt Anomalies in Defense Program It is hard to reconcile the President 's desire for an all-out production for offense effort with these facts : 1 . THE NEW YORK TIMES reports that an arms plant at Granite City , is closed by union picketing on account of delinquent dues of a few workers . The same issue reports that 3,500 C. I. 0 . men quit a shipyard on the West Coast over a ten-hour day row . -2 It was announced officially last week that labor leaders are to be exempt from rthe draft , indicating that these gentlemen must be considered vital to our defense program . It does seem that the least our boys in uniform might expect is that production would move unhampered and on schedule so that they may be provided with the tools of war , which every one knows is our greatest need today . DAVIS QUINN . New York , Feb. 24 , 1942.
