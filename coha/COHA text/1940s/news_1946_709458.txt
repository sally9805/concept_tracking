txt A year ago today , at 2:41 A. M. , French time , in a little red brick schoolhouse beside the railway tracks in Reims , the Nazi dream of world misrule was formally relinquished . At that hour it was still May 6 in the United States . May 8 was proclaimed as V-E Day . So we may take our choice of the proper day and hour to celebrate . The European war ended . That was the fact that spunted . The Asiatic war had still thrg months and one week to run . The two wars cost the world at least 20,000,000 dead , military and civilian . The crippled , the starved , the permanently stunted , will never be accurately counted . They must greatly outnumber the army of the dead . The money cost was in excess of a trillion dollars , or the equivalent of at least $500 for every human being on earth . But deaths , disabilities and dollars only begin to measure the expense . The Second World War shook civilization to its foundations . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society . We have but to look about us to see that the war debt is not just a matter of outstanding bonds . It is a debt that still has to be paid in sweat of the brow and the sweat of hard thinking , in anxiety and sacrifice , in devotion to ideals that could not be put on the shelf merely because the fighting had ended . We can measure the cost of the war .. in Europe 's condition today , and in the turmoil of India and China . The world has to be rebuilt . Human lives have to be reconstructed . Old beliefs , old habits , old hopes , old relationships have either to be restored or changed for new ones . In this chaotic scene the struggle between rival political and economic philosophies is intensified and embittered . The memory of violence is in the air . It is hard to be patient . Millions are hungry . They and other millions have lost the old sense of security . It is easy to turn them toward desperate remedies . Peace has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's minds . We can write all this down as part of the cost and loss of the war , and the major part . If this war could have been avoided we might have waited for evolution to take care of the clash of ideas between Russia and the Western democracies , between the Occident and the Orient . The rise of Mussolini , Hitler and the Japanese war lords could have been stopped . War came because this rise was not stopped in time and then had to be arrested and reversed by a ghastly expenditure of blood and treasure . The misguided men who hoped to wipe out nazism and communism at one stroke by " channeling Germany eastward , " the equally misguided Communists who believed that they could let Europe exhaust itself and then step in to rule it , have something to answer for . The lesson for all nations is that there must not be another war and that agreement among the United Nations is not merely desirable but absolutely essential to civilization 's survival . Another Victory Day would not be much to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for most of what we cherish .
