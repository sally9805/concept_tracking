Civil war in the U.S. within a decade after the peace , and the loss of freedom on the North American continent seem serious possibilities to Harvard 's shrewd , studious President James Bryant Conant . Last week , in an article in the May Atlantic Monthly entitled " Wanted : American Radicals , " he proposed some preventives . <P> War at Home . The postwar problems we shall have to face , says Dr. Conant , do not derive merely from a global war . The war itself was a manifestation of a larger maladjustment which afflicted American society before the war and will continue to do so after it . This maladjustment results from two fundamental and unresolved difficulties : 1 ) the relation of management and labor ; 2 ) the control and ownership of the tools of production . Unless these grave problems are solved in the spirit of what he calls " American radicalism , " he believes the U.S. will be embroiled in civil war at home , unable to fulfill any but an irresolute role internationally . <P> The Names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Conant , have disappeared from the public scene ; in fact , their very names have become meaningless . Their place has been taken by " reactionaries " - to give a name to those who would try to return to a condition approximating a prewar or " earlier status " - and by " radicals , " who look forward to a radically different society . The former he calls- " with due apologies " - American reactionaries ; the latter , European radicals , in that their ideas have been transplanted and are not indigenous . If the American future is to emerge from the conflict of only these two groups , he " fears greatly for the cause of freedom on this continent . " <P> The Prophets . Conant desires the reappearance of the American radical-of the successor to the men who abolished primogeniture at the founding of the Republic , who " with zest destroyed the Bank of the United States in the times of Andrew Jackson . " Such a man will " spring from the American soil , " will be firm in the belief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if not better " ; will support " the ideas of Jefferson as against the more aristocratic and monarchical conceptions drawn from Europe " ; and will have for his prophets not Marx , Engels and Lenin ( to whom he will be respectful ) but Thoreau and Emerson ; and for his poet , Whitman . <P> This American radical , confronting the dangers which will threaten his country after the war , will be " a fanatic believer in equality . " Though he will be willing , in times of peace , to let salaries and earnings exceed $25,000 a year ( for he believes in equality of opportunity , not of rewards ) , he will endeavor to prevent the growth of a caste system by demanding really effective inheritance and gift taxes and the breaking up of trust funds and estates . Once every generation , in effect , wealth would thus be redistributed . This , Dr. Conant warned , " can not be lightly pushed aside , for it is the kernel of his philosophy .
