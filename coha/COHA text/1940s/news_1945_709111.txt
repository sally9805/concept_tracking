txt The German armies were poised to strike at Czechoslovakia when the late Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain went to Munich on Sept. 29 , 1938 , and returned to London the next day proclaiming " peace in our time , " according to documentary evi , dence introduced today in the trial of twenty German war leaders . This was the answer , from secret German archives , to those who held at the time that Adolf Hitler was only bluffing . Records carefully kept by one of his adjutants , named Schmundt , showed that on Sept. 23 the German forces were ordered deployed at strategic points on ' the Czechoslovak frontier and that by the folr 1 lowing day they were at their " jumping-off places . " This aggressive move was taken only after the most careful prepar ration , the records showed . The German Army had spent the summer practicing to overwhelm the Czech defenses , and Konrad Hen1 lein , Czech Nazi leader , had been put in charge of the Freikorps in the Sudetenland to provide the necsary incidents for war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined to smash Czechoslovakia by military " action in the near future . " But he recognized that the issue with Czechoslovakia could be settled only in alliance with Italy and that his friendship with the late Benito Mussolini could be cemented only by promises of help in building the Italian empire in Africa . He saw no danger of a preventive war by the Western powers against Germany , and such was his disrespect for their military power that he ordered only five divisions to the western frontier to reinforce the border troops and labor battalions that , he estimated , would be sufficient to hold off any attack from that quarter . He was convinced that France would not march to help Czechoslovakia and he was certain that Britain would not lift a finger without France . // The only possible source of help for the Czechs , he said , was Russia , and the extent of her intervention , he estimated , would probably be the loan of planes , similar to what Germany and Italy had done in Spain . The court also received evidence that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia , Hitler was stealthily plotting a war of aggression and conquest against her . A directive dated Dec. 18 , 1940 , and issued from his headquarters ordered the armed forces to prepare to crush the Soviet Union " in a quick campaign before the end or the war with England . " . On May 2 , 1941 , according to a memorandum of a conversation between Hitler and his State Secretaries , he said that Germany 's need for food was the motive behind the attack . This memorandum , offered in evidence by Sidney Alderman of the American prosecuting staff , declared that the war in the west could be continued only if all Germany 's armed forces were fed by Russia in the third year of the war . Quotes Evidence of Brutal Plan The memorandum contained this observation , which , Mr. Alderman declared , proved incontrovertibly that the German conspirators were aware of the crimes against humanity to which their course of wanton aggression was leading : " There is no doubt that as a.result many millions of people will be starved to death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for us . " Two documents offered in support of the prosecution 's charge that all the defendants had engaged in the conspiracy to plunge the whole world into war with deliberate premeditation for German " living space " and loot were vainly challenged by Dr. Otto Stahmer , Hermann Goering 's attorney . They purported to be notes made from two speeches that Hitler made to his military chieftains on Aug. 22 , 1939 , a little more than a week before the invasion of Poland . Possessed with the idea that he was not long for this world , he told his military leaders that the hour of destiny had struck . Never again would conditions for a successful war be better and there might never again be leaders like himself and Mussolini , he said . He declared that Britain and France had no outstanding leaders . His one great fear , Hitler was alleged to have said , was that some " Schweinhund " would offer a mediation plan and spoil his scheme . Hitler discussed the international scene with his leaders on Nov. 5 , 1937 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but , if the use of force was too long delayed it would become obsolescent , and might even be matched or improved on by . potential enemies . The time had come , Hitler told his lieutenants , to prepare to strike . The best way to start a war with the Czechs , he thought , would be a " lightning-swift action " resulting from an " incident " such as the " assassination of the German Ambassador in Prague in connection with an anti-German demonstration . " There was evidence , Mr. Alderman said , that the Germans had actually planned to assassihate the May Call Molotoff NUREMBERG , Nov. 26 MD ? Fritz Sauter , counsel for former Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop , confirmed reports that he was considering asking that Foreign Commissar Vyacheslaff M. Molotoff be called as a defense witness . He said that he might also summon an unspecified Russian general . Dr. Stahmer denied reports that he had asked that Charles A. Lindbergh be summoned . " He said that he had no intention of asking a summons and no idea what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
