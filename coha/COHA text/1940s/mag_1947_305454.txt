In the hushed splendor of a Manhattan museum ( the Frick ) that was once a coal baron 's Fifth Avenue palace , some of the most serious U.S. poets and critics gathered . They had come to hear , and honor , the acknowledged first poet of their day . T. S. Eliot , making one of his rare U.S. appearances , delivered a new lecture on his old enemy , John Milton . <P> Long self-professed an Anglo-Catholic , a royalist , and a classicist , Eliot has been an uncommonly revolutionary conservative , both as poet and critic . Now he made clear that , in some respects , he regards the revolution as over . He was even convinced that poets can now study Milton 's poetry with profit . Said he : <P> " It was one of our tenets that . . . the subject-matter and the imagery of poetry should be ... related to the life of a modern man or woman ; that we were to seek the non-poetic . . . and words and phrases which had not been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the study of Milton could be no help ; it was only a hindrance . <P> " We can not , in literature any more than in the rest of life , live in a state of perpetual revolution . If every generation of poets made it their task to bring poetic diction up to date with the spoken language , poetry would fail in one of its most important obligations . For poetry should help , not only to refine the language of the time , but to prevent it from changing too rapidly ; a development of language at too great a speed would be ... progressive deterioration ; and that is our danger today . If the poetry of the rest of this century takes the line of development which seems to me . . the right course , it will discover new and more elaborate patterns of a diction now established . ... In this search it might have much to learn from Milton the greatest master of freedom within form in our language , outside the theater . ... It might also learn that the music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning expressed in the properest words . "
