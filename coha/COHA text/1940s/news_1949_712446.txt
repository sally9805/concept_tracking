txt When a victorious general : omen home it is customary to get out the band and give him a parade down Fifth Avenue in New York or Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington  --  sometimes both . Obviously . a military parade is not in order for a diplomat who in the obscurity of diplomacy conducts a brilliant operation Of quite as much value to his country as the winning of a battle . No real diplomat would even want it , and  --  Cavendish Cannon , our returning Ambassador to Yugoslavia , is one of the shiest and most retiring of all diplomats . He would be horrified if anyone were to suggest a public demonstration in his behalf . But it is in order to note that distinguished service to one 's country can be rendered in ways other than on a battlefield . And it also is in order to note that our corps of career diplomats , which has been ridiculed so often as a collection of " striped pants , " " pink tea and peppermints. " and " cookie pushers , " can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accustomed to expect from either generals or bags of dollars . The simplest way to express Mr. Cannon 's service is to say that in effect he performed the role of midwife at the delivery of Yugoslavia from the Soviet orbit . The delivery was successful . Its effect has been to extract 20 excellent divisions from Moscow 's order of battle . break Moscow 's grip on the Danube Basin . permit liquidation of the Cominform operation , in Greece . and place Marshal Tito as a buffer between the agents of Moscow and Italy 's exposed , vulnerable . and poorly defended northern frontier . Secretary of State Dean Acheson is said to have remarked of the Cannon mission that it goes to prove diplomacy is cheaper than war . In power politics , which is what we are engaged in with Soviet Russia . the diplomatic technique is first to secure a position which permits exploi tation if opportunities occur , and , second , to develop those opportunities if and when they do occur . That is what Ambassador Cannon did in Yugoslavia . He arrived in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stalin . He did not have ally idea when he went that such a break might come . He merely had a conviction , based on long experience in the Balkans , that no situation in the Balkans ever , is as rigid or permanent as it may seem to be . He went to Belgrade determined to obtain room for maneuver . His opening moves were elementary and sound almost trivial . One of them was ' to be correctly formal in a country which had experienced no diplomatic formalities since the war hit Belgrade in 1940 . That is , when he called on the Yugoslav Foreign Minister he treated him as unfriendly . which he was at that time . but also as a foreign minister . Ambassador Cannon carried his gloves . More important , when it seemed that the Balkan countries might recognize the guerrilla regime in Greece as a government , Ambassador Cannon ' told the Yugoslav Foreign Minister that if any such thing happened , he would . hold Yugoslavia responsible . saying that so far as he was concerned Yugoslavia was the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , again the treated Yugoslavia as unfriendly , which it still was , but as important . The result was that when the break came the Yugoslav Government officials regarded him as a man who respected them even though he disagreed with them . * * * His judgment was of enormous ' importance during those early days of the break , as it was all the way through . First , there was the question of assessing whether it was a trap . as many observers were inclined to think . Second , there was the ques- lion whether Marshal Tito had a chance to survive the retaliation of Moscow . At that time , some State Department oflicials-thought Marshal Tito " would last only six or eight weeks . Ambassador Cannon assessed both problems accurately . Events have confirmed his judgment on every point . ' There was many a pitfall along the way . Any sudden change in relations between Yugoslavia and the United States could have been fatal . A wild demonstration of American affection could have been the kiss of death for Marshal Tito . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to try harder than he did to regain the good graces of Moscow . Insistence do condition , for a resumption of friendly relations might . have spoiled the operation . Ambassador Cannon did not make a single . mistake . He did not cajole. entice , attempt to buy . or threaten . What he did ' do in Belgrade was to bolster the confidence of those who wanted to get away from Moscow . Whenever they could use a little proper help advantageously , he got it for them . In return for that help , Yugoslavia cut of its aid to the Greek guerrillas and opened up relations with Italy . Trieste ceased to be a problem . The Austrian frontier issue ceased to be a danger or a source of friction . Marshal Tito 's secret , police turned , their attention i away from members of the old regime who had served the Allies faithfully during the war and concentrated them against the agents of the Cominform . The otherfwestern ambassadors in Belgrade credit. , Mr. Cannon with being the strategist of the operation . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of diplomacy as a classic example of the success of a mission . We have some first-class diplomats . It 's time we admitted it instead of clinging to the old " striped pants " nonsense .
