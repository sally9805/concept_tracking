As spring 's gaudy carpet rolled north last week , the drive-in theaters were opening almost as fast as the daffodils . This week , New York City will get its first " ozoner " : a 600-car , $300,000 affair on Staten Island . Six were open in Dayton , Ohio alone , and six would be running in St. Louis by summer . According to Boxoffice , more than 200 new drive-ins this year would swell the U.S. total-a mere 100-odd when war ended-to 546 built &; building . <P> The boom had a firm foundation : by showing better pictures than before and showing them sooner ( though few get first runs ) , and by keeping prices down ( average : 55 for adults ) , they were giving many a regular movie house a run for its money . Getting a consistent share of better films is still a drive-in problem . But distributors can not ignore the drive-in customer capacity : now almost one-twelfth of the national " indoor " seating . <P> The drive-ins offer inducements to everyone in the family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young children , playgrounds full of swings and teeters ; for older children , necking-room free of cops &; robbers ; for mother &; father , an evening out without the expense of a baby sitter or the trouble of parking ; for the aged , infirm or overweight , the chance to see a movie in comfort . For everyone , there are snack bars ( with car service ) , rest rooms , fresh air and , in season , mosquitoes . And proprietors are still innovating : last week , one Tennessee drive-in added a while-you-wait laundry service . <P> Since the war , drive-ins have also multiplied their technical refinements . The sound , which in the first movie parks issued sometimes from staggered loudspeakers , sometimes from underground grilles , is now brought into the family car over small portable speakers . This device , with the help of a good windshield wiper , brings the show through clearly even during pelting rainstorms ( though fog is still a bugbear ) ; and some northern drive-in managers are dreaming that a new combination heater-speaker will enable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convenience is an artificial " moon , " of amber and green shaded lights , that perches on a tall pole in the rear of the parking area , enabling patrons to grope their way to comfort stations and move their cars about without smashing fenders . <P> One problem is still baffling . No matter how massive the screen ( one of the biggest : 65 by 50 ft. ) , or how super-powerful the water-cooled projection equipment , a good many people have to sit almost a thousand feet from the screen , and have trouble seeing details . The ozoners had not yet found a way around that .
