whatever about it . But another force within her brought her to her feet and carried her over to the door . She opened it and looked out . Right and left of her the neighbors ' houses stood dark and apparently deserted . The front door of one stood open ; a basket of miscellaneous , untidy articles had been dropped and left on the doorstep of the other . It must be long past midnight , she knew . But this strange , empty silence was not that of ordinary night . She called loudly , " Mrs. O'Brien . Oh , Mollie O'Brien . " Nobody answered her . She called again , another name . Again silence . Then she stood , contemplating the quiet and at the same time aware of the roar , still distant , but more noticeable , more penetrating . Suddenly she knew that what she heard was the roar of the speeding river , coursing in flood somewhere just beyond the rim of the Flat which she could reach in two dozen steps if she walked straight ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a huge delight that she had stayed to meet this heaven-sent destructionand not run away to the high ground where her bodily safety would only prolong her inner suffering . Then she turned back into the house and looked at Patrick . He had raised his head and in some queer way he seemed to be listening . He could not possibly know what was happening . He had heard nothing for many months ; he could not have been pretending the insensibility that had come over him . But still , he seemed to be listening now . His mouth hung open a little and one gnarled hand went behind his ear . Mary watched him , repelled by the semblance of reason that she knew was not there . She even went over to him and said , " Dad . Do you hear anything ? " He paid no attention to her . But his attitude forced her to realize with sudden , startling rallying of her forces , that he and she were both in a danger which now loomed horrible when a moment before it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment her nerves rebounded , from one extreme to another equally unreasoned . Instantly she was galvanized to frantic action . There was no time now to wonder which of the two impulses was the truer , whether she had really meant to sit and be drowned and let her father drown , or whether this violent will to save him and herself was and had been all along her real intention . She ran to him , noting from the tail of her eye as she did so , that the loud-ticking clock on the wall said five o'clock . She would always remember the sight and the sound of that battered clock with its cracked glass and clumsy pendulum . She seized a shawl from a bench and wrapped it round her shoulders , tucking the ends into her belt . Then she pushed her father 's chair to the door and opened it . Beneath her feet the ground had disappeared . In the few moments since she had stood and called the neighbors , something had happened . Where cindery gravel , mud , and cobbles had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water now . Mary had intended to lower her father 's chair to the ground and push it up the alley and toward the rising ground that ran into Rebecca Street . But she found now that she could not lift the wheels of the chair over the raised sill of the doorway . The front wheel stuck against it . She tried turning the chair around , and then sawP201that she could not push the heavy back wheels over the threshold and down the steps without losing control of the whole chair and letting it and her father tumble into the water . She turned the chair again , and , holding onto the back of it with one hand , bent down and tried desperately to edge the crooked rusty front wheel over the sill . She could not do it . The water at the bottom of the steps was spreading quickly and Mary could no longer see the ground through it . She looked at Patrick . He sat just inside the door , still cupping his ear with his hand , still with that half-crazy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faint raw dawn light was suddenly cut off , she raised her head and looked up from the chair . Straight before her , coming straight at her , solid as the side of a mountain , was a weaving , shimmering wall of gray . She could no longer see anything else . It blotted out the shacks across the alley ; it was higher than her head . And it was moving fast . Mary stood petrified . She could not have turned and run if she had tried . Right and left , and straight before her , the towering thick gray wall rolled forward in a deafening surge . Water , she thought , making a throaty sound of terrified disbelief . Water standing straight up in the air , higher than her head , higher than a house . . . . She closed her eyes . . . opened them . She bent again over the chair . But it was too late . The wave hit the shack with a roar like dynamite . It stunned her . Her numb fingers let go the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crumb from a table . She was hurled back , tossed and swung about the careening cracking floor . The shack heaved and swayed on its flimsy foundation . The mountain of water wrenched it loose and swept it , on the crown of a whole streetful of debris , right off the Flat and into the course of the flood , swirling round and round . Almost unconscious , Mary clung to the kitchen dresser . As the water rushed in , she groped instinctively and half-blindly for the rickety attic stairs . Paul was running along the high embankment above the Flat . He was bent on getting to the shack to see for himself that Mary had been removed to safety . He knew that the police warnings had covered this district , and that the shanties below must be empty by now . Yet something troubled him . His memory would not let him relax . Those last bitter words of Mary 's kept ringing in his head : " I shall never leave this house again . " She could not have meant them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . He must make sure . He ran down Rebecca Street , droppingsteeply to the Flat , gathering speed . It was barely dawn . He could just see the outlines of the ramshackle houses below him , with water filling the alleys between . As he came to the edge of the Flat he looked upriver where the water was roaring so wild and loud . And he stopped dead in his tracks . Not half a mile away he saw that great gray wall of water , gobbling up the wreckage of everything that had lain in its way . Paul stood panting on the last slight rise of ground , measuring the advance of the water against the distance that separated him from the Rafferty shack . And as he eyed the shack through the deceiving half-light , he gulped and stood rigid with horror . For the door of the shanty was open and there was something in the doorway , which should have been empty . Something that looked like a chair , and behind the chair a bent , shadowy form moving in jerks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faint light , once more . With one desperate glance at the advancing wave upriver , Paul plunged onto the Flat . It was a short run to the shack ; he could beat the tidal wave . But he had not counted on the depth of the water that had already inundatedthe bottom land . The water was almost up to his knees , and it rushed past him with a strong undertow like breakers on a beach . He could scarcely make headway against it . He ran slowly and futilely , the frustrated runningof a nightmare , while the roar of the tidal wave , like steady thunder , sounded closer and closer over his head . Now he was very near the house . He could clearly see in the open doorway the horrible sight of the witless old man , nodding and mouthing , with his hand cupped to his ear ; and more horribly , he could see Mary struggling on the doorstep with the chair , pushing and hauling . Oh why , he thought crazily , why . . . . The water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his chest , in a minute he would be swimming , he would have to . . . . And the thunder in his ears roared like the sea breaking to swallow him up and crush him and extinguish him .. . Mary too , he thought , gasping . Mary too . Then he was lifted off his feet . He gave one last lunge , the house was almost in his grasp . Mary could have heard him shout but for the deafening roar of the water . And his fingers missed the house . He was swung and cracked about ; his eardrums rattled ; the cold , thundering water closed over his head . He could never remember afterwards what happened during his struggle with the river . He was sucked down , rolled over and over , buffeted , shot upward , sucked down again . Each time he came to the surface , with straininglungs , he took a huge breath . He was fighting for his life , and knew only that . Then , just before it was too late , he collided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he flung his arms automatically around the wooden beam , and clung to it . The water was so cold that he felt his endurance could be only a matter of minutes more , perhaps of seconds . He did not care . He could see nothing ; no Rafferty shack , no other recognizableobject ; only the cold black tumbling water from which he had given up hope of being rescued . Suddenly the big timber to which he was weakly clinging struck somethingsolid , with a shock so violent that Paul nearly lost his grip . The other end of the beam was swinging around , athwart the current . Presently it stopped , incredibly motionless , and Paul knew only that he was clutching that beam , stationary while the whole river seethed past him . He could not struggle any more . He knew dully that his arms and legs were numb , and his strength was waning . Weakly he looked around , wondering how much longer he would remain conscious . Tangled in the water around his knees he saw the beam caught in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oh yes , on an island . . . must be Brunot Island . He shook his head hard , as if to clear his wits . With one last effort he swung his trembling legs onto the upstream side of the beam , and thus was held against it and in the tree by the force of the current . He sat there , trying to rally his strength , trying to rouse his dulled mind and his will power . He opened his eyes widep203to force back that dreadful dullness which kept coming over him . And then , because he thought he was addled anyway , he saw the roof of a house  --  in fact a whole house , submerged almost to the attic window , careening down the raging Ohio . If I could reach that house , he thought dully .. . I might . . . . But how ? It was whirling down midstream , and would pass about fifty yards from his island . Suppose I tried it , he thought . . . even if I had the strength left to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was useless , he would be swept down the current much faster than the house . He looked up again . If I wait , he thought , until it passes me , and then strike out and let the current carry me down on it . . . . The house was almost abreast of him and he was fighting to keep his wits clear and work the thing out . Then his jaw dropped and he gulped in his breath . That was not just a house , some house . It was the Rafferty shack . Oh no . . . . Yes , it is , he shouted aloud , as if to rouse himself . It is . How . . . why . . . never mind that now . . . it is . While he watched , gasping , he saw the shack bump something , lurch , and swirl . As it turned he saw the attic window and hanging from the window , a limp figure with red hair streaming down , almost trailing in the water . Oh God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moments as the shack careened along , oh God , help me now . That 's Mary . Dead or alive . . . it 's Mary . He crouched on his beam like an animal . In the few minutes since the beam had been snagged in the trees the water had risen . He could feel the treetrunks swaying in the current . He inched his way along to the edge of his precarious refuge , never taking his eyes from the shack . His fingers fumbled numbly as he wrenched off one shoe ; he had lost the other without knowing it . The shack was downriver now ; it seemed almost beyond his reach , but he had shrewdly let it go on ahead of him . He must let it get far enough , but not too far , or he would never have the strength to grasp it when he was swept down on it . At last , when he dared not wait any longer , he let go of the timber , drew a great breath , and struck out with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had judged his distance instinctively and he had judged it well . The river rolled him down on the house as he swam . Now it was only a few feet away , now his hand touched it , now the current was crushing him against the wall . He fumbled for a foothold , his eyes raised to the terrifying figure of Mary just above his head . He could almost touch her hair . His feet found the cornice of the kitchen window , and with a surge of the current he lifted himself far enough to grasp the sill of the attic window above . With a last grueling effort he drew his shoulder muscles into a strained , spastic knot , lifted himself to the sill beside Mary , and collapsed across her body as if he himself were dying.  |p204PAUL  CAME TO IN A few seconds , desperately aware that he must still fight . In his arms Mary was limp and icy cold . If there was any life in her , he must rouse her and fight for it ; only by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muscles were knotted and cramped so that he could scarcely move his arms ; his legs were agonizing too . When he tried to lift his head , jagged lines danced before his eyes and he almost lost his balance . Just in time he lurched the other way and fell inward , through the window , clutching Mary and dragging her in with him . The blood rushed back to his head as he fell ; holding Mary in his numb arms he toppled across the sill and dropped on the slimy attic floor . It was a short drop , for the attic was no more than an airhole under the roof . Sprawled on the floor with Mary in his arms , he looked up and saw that a nail inside the window had caught her clothes and held her ; but for that she would have been swept out and drowned . Her face was lifeless but he felt her heart beating faintly . He began to try to bring her to . Her wet clothing clung to her in a sodden , ice-cold mass ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He ripped , pulled , and fumbledwith her clothes until he could get at the stays underneath them . He flung the things away . He began to chafe and massage her body and her legs and arms , at the same time forcing his own breath between her parted blue lips , and holding her close to warm her with the heat of his own body . His efforts warmed him too . His own struggle had kept his circulation going but now for the first time he felt the powerful , reassuring sensation of the second wind . He was so empty that his stomach was beginning to contract in painful cramps , yet he could not have called the emptiness hunger . He felt curiously strong and charged with super-energy that he had never before known he possessed . He opened his shirt and his undershirt and held Mary close to the warmth of his naked chest , slipping her limp , icy hands inside his damp clothing to warm them against his body . And all the while he talked to her , begging , pleading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm here . It 's Paul . You 're safe now . Mary . Darling . Open your eyes and look at me . Darling , open your eyes .... " And presently she did . The blue lids rolled back and beneath them the gray eyes stared , shocked and unseeing . He shook her gently , holding her tight , and raising her head on his arm . " Darling . Oh , Mary , I 've found you . " She gazed at him dumbly for a moment ; then her head fell back over his arm and she murmured , " Paul . " " Yes , " he whispered . He stroked the tangled hair from her forehead and tried to shelter her from the draught with his body . " Do n't slip away from me , darling . " Her features looked as if they were chiselled from gray marble . He could hardly speak . His voice stuck in his throat . " Do n't go . "  |p205She  made a soft sound , a sigh or a groan , he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary ! " He shook her hard now and his voice roared out suddenly , startling him as much as her . She shuddered and looked at him again . He tried to keep chafing her arms and legs while he talked ; he saw now that he must keep her startled if he was to keep her conscious and get her to make any effort to stay alive . " Darling , we 're in great danger . We 've got to fight . We must keep alive . Do you understand ? " He spoke very loud , very distinctly . " Ah . " She made another soft sound . " Try to understand me , darling . We 'll be overcome unless we fight . We must save each other . You must try . " He shook her again . " You must try . Will you , Mary ? Will you try ? " She opened her eyes again . As gently as possible he dragged her to a sitting position beside him . He had barely enough strength to lift her . She collapsed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , still talking and shaking her a little . " That 's better , " he murmured . " You understand . Now see , I 'm perfectlyfine , dear , warm and not a bit chilled . I 'll keep us both warm . But you must try to move , darling . Make all the effort you can . " She nodded weakly . " Move your hands and feet as soon as you can , dear . I 'll keep on rubbingthem until we get them warm . The air 's not very cold , darling . If we can just keep our blood going .... " An hour later she was almost herself again ; ghastly pale and dishevelled beyond anything he could have imagined , but able to comprehend where she was and what had happened to her . Her arms and legs were scratched and bleeding ; there was a cruel , ugly bruise on her left temple ; her dress hung about her in rags , the buttons and fastenings ripped off , the flounces from the skirt trailing in dirty , ragged loops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How did you find me ? " she asked at last . He told her , hurrying over his own adventures to get on to hers . " And Dad ? " He explained about the Flat . " Ah . May God rest his poor soul . " She crossed herself weakly . Paul held her closer . " If you had only gone up the hill when the warnings went out , darling ! You knew about the flood coming , did n't you ? She nodded , her face turned away from him . " Then why did n't you do something ? Why did you stay there on the Flat after everybody else had gone ? " She did not answer at once . Finally she whispered , " I wanted to die . " He cringed ; he felt a hollow opening up inside him , a bitter , empty , deadening chasm in which floated the wreckage of their lives . " Oh do n't . " " I should n't have said it . I 'm sorry , dear . I know better now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She nodded again . " It is n't easy to die . We 've no business tryin ' to take things out o ' Gods hands . " She mumbled a little confusedly and slipped off at phrases into her old forgotten brogue . " If He 'd meant me to die I 'd be dead there in the water , long ago . " She had no remembrance of getting up to the attic of the house when the water inundated the lower floor . She did not know now why she had gone to the window ; " I think , " she said , " because I was sick . I think I threw up a lot of water . " " Poor darling . Poor Mary . " The day passed and it grew dark . The house was moving slowly in the flood current . Only by watching the wooded banks could Paul see that they were moving down the Ohio . Evidently this would go on all night . There was no use trying to go downstairs . The water was up to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downstairs windows . The attic smelled vilely . It had never been furnished and it was now a dark , slimy , black hole . There was nothing to do , though , but sit on its rough wet planks , holding Mary in his arms and praying that she would stay alive until some kind of help came . At last he lay down on the floor and held Mary beside him . " Let 's try to sleep , " he whispered . " Let me try to keep you warm . " So he lay in the cold dark , holding the wraith of Mary in his arms . Only to hold her in sleep answered as much desire as he had the strength to feel . Thin and light , she lay in his arms like an autumn leaf , with the same sad promise of fluttering away . His body was numb and sore , but he prayed that there would be enough warmth in its muscle and bulk to protectthem both until daylight . His bare feet were agony in the cold . Damp and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot through the small of his back and down his legs ; his arms ached leadenly but he tried not to move them . His tongue was thick and sour ; a vile taste clung to his mouth ; the odor of his dirty body and dirty clothes , the damp stink of the house was abominable . He slept fitfully at first , later with heavy exhaustion . A brilliant rising sun fell on his closed eyes , and he opened them , turning his stiff neck to look at Mary curled against his breast . The sun sparkled on the wild disorder of her hair . He was aware of an agonizing cramp in his stomach . He put his hand on his belly and felt dull surprise to find it hard and distended , blown up with gas . He had had nothing to eat for two nights and a day . Neither had she . He looked down at her . The bluish pallor of her lips , the dark purple circles around her closed eyes filled him with real terror . And here was the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She rubbed them with blank bewilderment . He saw fear coming into her face , and he spoke quickly , saying anything to comfort her . " Look , darling ! Look at the sunshine ! That means the worst is over . " " What good will the sun do us ? " she murmured sleepily . " We may be dead before  --  before  --  " Just as she spoke they felt a lurch . The floor pitched downward and threw them against the wall . Mary sat up and cried , " What was that ? "  |p207Paul  put his head out of the window and looked out . " I think we 've stopped . I think the house is aground . " " Oh . " Her eyelids fluttered wearily and she gave in to a fit of shivering . " Do n't you understand , darling ? I think we 're aground . " She gave a hysterical laugh . " Grand ! We can go right downstairs and cook breakfast . " She looked out the window at the water about two feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary ! With this change in the weather and the house standing still , it may be very different a few hours from now . " Mary looked at his streaked face , pale under the dirt and the bristling growth of whiskers . She shook her head . " You look awful , Paul . All in . Do you feel sick ? " He shook his head . " No . Do you ? " She pulled her rags tighter . Her teeth chattered . " Oh , no . I 'm fine . " As if to deny that , she closed her eyes weakly . " Mary ! " he cried , in a panic . She opened her eyes suddenly and looked up at him . He bent down and stared hard into them . Huge , sombre pools of gray , rimmed with weary purple shadows , they met his with directness , but without candor . They were intent , but veiled . They had no answer for the silent questions in his . " Mary  --  " The blue lids came down and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their sodden clothes and hung them out of the attic windows to dry in the sun . Mary kept very busy about that , seeming to have found unexpected energy . Paul watched her . Several times he started to say something and checked himself , but finally he asked hoarsely , " Are you horribly hungry , Mary ? " It was a cruelty to ask that question . But he could no longer keep the thought under control ; he had to prod it like an aching tooth . " I could do with a cup of tea , " she said . Her voice quavered . " There may be something I can fix downstairs when we can get to it . " The water was going down rapidly . All day they watched out of the windows as the lower part of the house began coming up into sight . By late afternoon Paul shouted , " I can see the front door . I 'm going down . " He had a handful of sulphur matches in his overall pocket . Early that morning he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window sill in the sun , and all day Mary had watched to see that they did not blow away . Now they were dry . He struck one and by its light began groping his way down the dark , steep ladder-like stairs . Mary followed . The lower floor was still under some water . Mary gasped as the incredible mess came in sight . All the furniture was tumbled together against one wall . They both gagged at the sour , sodden smell . Paul pushed and pulled at the twisted litter of furniture until he disentangled an iron bed . The mattress on it was soaked , and gave off an unbearable odor . Paul pitched it through the window . Then he turned to Mary , to ask where she wanted him to begin cleaning up . But she paid no attention to him . She was leaning against the crumblingwall ; her head was drooping : she had turned a ghastly putty-color , and her half-open eyes rolled horribly.  | " Mary . " He ran over and picked her up . " Darling ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her endurance . He did not know how sparsely she had eaten in the shack with her father the past two weeks . Her stomach was accustomed to a minimum of food ; but she was collapsingnow . He laid her on the bare iron spring of the bed and looked for something to cover her . That was futile . Every thread of stuff in the house , everything he touched , was soaking wet . Finally he slipped off his filthy , foul-smelling denim shirt , folded it , and put it under her cheek so that the wire bedspring would not cut it . Then he made his way into the kitchen , stumbling over tumbled , broken furniture , clattering rusted pots and pans , sharp-cornered objects that cracked and barked his shins and bruised his bare toes . He did not dare to pause to take stock of anything . He knew now that if he did not quickly find something for them to eat they would both be overcome by starvation . To wake to the insistent shouts of Paul 's voice from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to smell smoke ; to hear the crackling of a fire ; to see him coming through the door with a smile of triumph , was unbelievable . He took her in his arms and lifted her off the bed . He carried her into the kitchen and set her on a three-legged stool by the stove . " Fire . " She held out her hands , trembling ; tears of weakness and relief sprang into her eyes . She looked up at Paul . " How did you do it ? " He did not answer . He was busy by the door , kneeling down with a tin dipper in his hands . He dipped river-water into the battered teakettle that he had rummaged out of the debris . He skimmed sticks , brown leaves , and bits of trash out of the water . Then he came back and put the kettle on the fire . They hugged the stove , rubbing their hands over the heat . The sensation of warmth was overwhelming . Their faces turned from ghastly greenish-white to sudden feverish red ; their eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look normal . Once they mastered the fits of trembling that first overcame them , they groaned with the relief of the warmth . " Oh how wonderful , " Mary said . " Ah ! Oh , Paul , how did you do it ? " " Never mind , now . The next thing is to get something inside us . Are you warm enough to come over here now and see if there 's anything fit to eat ? " They sorted the soaked and jumbled contents of the cupboard . Nearly everything in it was ruined . But it had contained a set of tin canisters ; one of these had held tea , another flour , another navy beans , another sugar . The sugar had melted , the flour was a cold gray paste ; but the tea and the beans , though wet and swollen , were not beyond use . " Darling ! " Paul grabbed her shoulders and shook , them gently . " Teal We 're not going to die ! We 'll be all right . " They rummaged further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul had found a full can of kerosene . It was with that , and with some chips hacked from the attic beams upstairs , and some lumps of soft coal from the overturnedscuttle , that he had got the fire going . And there too , wedged tightlyp209under the overturned table , was a sack of potatoes . Mary 's lips trembled . She looked up at Paul . " Is it possible ? " she breathed . She stared at him . " Paul , " she said . " God must want us to live . " He was standing by the stove watching the kettle come to a boil . He met her eyes , and for an instant the cataclysm that had swept over them seemed to have bound them in a new , though distant and different understanding . Paul had never felt this way before . He could say nothing . Mary turned away to look for the teapot ; then she returned to the stove . " It 'll taste very queer , " she said . " The canister leaked and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange . It was brackish and sour , but so welcome to their tortured stomachs that they gasped happily . " We 'll be all right now , Paul . " Mary looked up at him with some of her old , calm courage . " I feel as if I could stand anything now . " He had been watching her with a queer expression , almost as if he had found a stranger standing there beside him by the stove . His eyes travelled from her torn , hanging , wild red hair , over her slender uncorseted body in its wrinkled rags , down to her bruised feet . She had lost both shoes and one stocking long ago ; the other stocking was a crumpled black rag around her ankle . Looking at her , staring , Paul wondered dumbly if this could be the exquisite , delicate creature that he had loved so madly and desired so hotly time upon time in the past . He remembered moments when her slender milky neck , rising from some daintily embroidered frill , had arched back over his bent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into his . He remembered passionate moments , like the last time he had ever been alone with her before the tragedy of his father 's death ; when she had been a woman both poised and voluptuous with avowed desire . There was no trace now of that lost unforgettable woman , but neither was there any loss of the quality that had always been hers  --  the strange sort of beauty , the luminous , unearthly inner light , which shone all the clearer through the preposterous apparition that stood beside him now . Indeed , that half-earthly , half-ghostly quality was emphasized now as it had not been for years ; it was the Irish , the fantastic , the strange , the foreign ; the thing that made her different , the thing that had made her haunt him in spite of all his efforts to escape . Her eyes followed his as they moved in pity , in awe , almost in horror from her head to her feet . She looked down at her rags , and then up at him . " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in such a state ! " She blushed slowly . " I 'd never really have known you if I had n't . " He spoke in a low , grave tone , tense and considered . " We may be here quite some time , Mary . You must understand that . " He took a step toward her . She looked about the room . There was the same subtle gesture of escape in her action that he had remarked before , the same calm evasion of something she could clearly perceive . Without a word or a gesture she held him off . Darkness fell once again , but this time they were more comfortable.  |p210Mary  had found some candles and Paul lit one in the kitchen . Then he went up to bring down some bedding from the roof , where he had been drying it . By the flickering candlelight Mary was bending over a small rusty tin basin of warm water , doing as best she could to wash . The bodice of her ragged dress was open ; she had dropped it down over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then in the next room . And then there was entire silence . " Mary . " He stood in the doorway , his hands hanging at his sides , his eyes fixed on her , his mouth a little open . She turned from the basin and straightened up . The look she gave him was profound . They stood and stared across the small room at each other , their eyes strained wide . " Mary . " His voice was extremely low , and in it rang the strange , penetratingresonance of a strained bass chord . She stood and stared at him ; the elusiveness was gone from her face . He walked slowly towards her , keeping his eyes on her white , tense face , on her gray eyes with their black pupils hugely distended . He came over and put his blackened , lacerated hands on her body . Beneath the ragged shift he felt her pounding heart under the jutting ribs . There was scarcely any flesh between her bones and her blue-white skin except for the small warm mounds of her breasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We never knew anything we were talking about . We always talked too much . " She bent her head to escape his searching eyes . " That 's all over , " he said , breathing hard . " There 's nothing more to say . Nothing else left in the whole damned world . " He made a hoarse , heavy , anguished sound ; picked her up with a quick , rough motion , and carried her into the other room . That night ; next day ; another night , and another day . Only by the dark following the light , by the color of the changing sky , had they any measure of passing time . In pain and wretchedness , in cold and strain , through agony and violence , they were united at last . The poetic delicacy of their early love , the romance , the elusive ideal , were burned away in the fire of despairing passion . Life had torn from them the means to realize their love in beauty , in tenderness , in safety , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned the power of the quality that had imprisoned him for years . He discovered now the burning , steely core of the woman whose girlhood he had shared . That girlhood had been only an exquisite veil . Behind it there was power ; this tense strength pulsating in the emaciated body ; this physical counterpart of the fanatical will that had tormented and challenged him for years . There was directness , clear fire , furious intensity in the passion of a woman who looked like a saint even while she lay naked in his arms between coarse gray blankets , her hair streaming about her shoulders and his . Lying there in the early morning , with Paul 's head buried in her breast , Mary stared through the gaping window at the faint rosy light in the sky ; stared with her gray eyes wide and hard , fixed on space . She had managedp211long since to stop thinking . Somewhere back of this whole furious immolationof Nature , back of her memory , back of the confused nightmare of death and devastation , lay buried the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been . They were buried as deeply and irrevocably as her own brother and Paul 's father . They were done . This man with whom she was exploring  --  eagerly , willingly exploring  --  the powers of her body and his , had the outward person of the Paul she loved . Behind that there was mystery . Sometimes their eyes met in silent exchange of the long chain of thoughts strung down the baffling years . Sometimes their eyes did not meet at all . This hoarse , haggard , stubble-bearded man , with his hungry mouth , his hard , commanding hands , his powerful masterful body was not the yearning , sensitive Paul of the rickety old steps , the pleading , anxious youth of the long-ago walks , the pathetic letters to London . He did not plead that he loved her now . He did not speak in words , He spoke in a stark and savage language . She understood it because she had the iron in her blood , the fire in her nerves , to understand and to answer . On that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if her open eyes were staring not at space but at a complete , supernatural panorama : the years that lay behind her and Paul , and the years that lay ahead . She saw it all , lying there , watching the dawn turn the window gray . She moved carefully from Paul 's arms and crept quietly out of bed . One of the shabby gray wool blankets lay on a chair . She wrapped it around her shoulders and walked noiselessly over to the window , to gaze out on the waste of water which still surrounded them everywhere . The dawn was pink on the horizon behind the stark February trees . The river was like a broad , flowingsheet of glass almost as far as she could see . She was not alone for long . She heard Paul stirring on the bed behind her . He was awakened and frightened by her absence ; he sat up in momentaryterror . Then he saw her standing at the window . He got out of bed and crossed the room . They wrapped themselves together in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The water is down , " Mary said . " We could wade across  --  I suppose  --  " " Why  --  I guess we could , " Paul said . There was dark surprise on his face . " I 'd never thought of it . " " Perhaps we did n't want to think of it , " Mary said . " That 's so . " Paul 's arm tightened around her shoulder . They stoodsilent for a long time . Then he said , " I 've never been afraid of anything before . But now , Mary  --  now . I 'm afraid  --  that the water will go down . " " It will go down , " she said . She was still staring out at the river . " I do n't want to go back , " he said , very low . " You  --  we  --  must . Of course . " Then she turned rather abruptly and looked up at him and said , her voice throbbing , " Paul . Have you learned what I 've learned ? Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during these weird , hourless days he had fought against knowing . He had tried to tell himself that that was not so . But always this strange new understanding , this acceptance of fate of God , Mary would put it  --  had come back . Always now it would block his own passionate revolt . He looked deeply into Mary 's eyes . She was waiting for him to speak . " I think I have , " he whispered . " I have learned something . I do n't know just what it is . " " I will tell you what it is . " She drew closer to him as if she were confessingsome fear herself . But her voice was firm . " This  --  is not the beginning of the future , Paul  --  " " No  --  " " It 's not the beginning of the future , " she said . " It is the end of the past . " LATER THAT MORNING they were in the kitchen drinking the nauseous brew that they called tea , and preparing to eat more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply of fuel was dwindling  --  Paul had torn nearly all the beams off the attic . The mildewed tea leaves in the canister were almost gone . They had triumphed for a little while over time and over thought . But as they prepared this breakfast they were deeply silent . The world was crowding in on them again . " Hey ! Hey there ! Anybody in there ? " Mary started , paled , and caught at her throat . Paul raised his head , listened , and went to the window . Mary followed him , putting her hand on his arm . " Paul  --  I  --  what is it ? " He turned , his face grave . " Someone to rescue us . " " Oh my God . " She put her face in her hands . He watched her , knowing what she felt . There was no comfort he could offer her . " Anybody there ? " The rough voice shouted outside again . Mary went slowly into the other room . Paul put his head through the window and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are . " A rowboat pulled around the corner of the house . A man in it rested on his oars and looked up at Paul . " Well fer all time ! I seen yer smoke , some way upriver there . " " Where are we ? " asked Paul . " Why ye 're marooned on Turtle Island . Funniest thing I ever see . Are ye all right ? " " I guess so . Can you get us out of here ? " " Sure thing . Who else ye got there ? " " My  --  a  --  a woman I saved . We were both caught in the flood . ' The man pulled the boat into the mud and leaped ashore into the soggy muck . Paul went into the bedroom and spoke to Mary . She was sitting on the edge of the bed , staring at the floor ; her face was expression/less . He watched her for a moment . Then he said , " We 'd better go , dear . " " Yes , we 'd better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gesture was distressingand eloquent ; as if to look for something that must belong to her in this room where she had known revelation . She shook her head and stood up . Paul stared at her for a moment . " It is queer , " he said . " It 's damned queer to walk out of this place the way we came into it . The only place  --  " " Come on , " said Mary quickly . She bit her lips . In the boat the man told them that they were twenty-one miles west of Pittsburgh . The Ohio at this point was two-thirds of a mile wide ; both banks were thickly wooded . Steep cliffs dropped down to the water , and for a quarter of a mile inland , on both sides , the man said , the riverside land was uninhabited . " Funny thing , " he said , chewing tobacco and spitting into the water . " You 'd think there 'd been parties searchin ' around here for folks like you . Guess there ain ' ' nough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This ben a bad flood . " " I do n't know a thing about it , " Paul said , " except this part of it I was in . " " Where d'ye come from ? " " Allegheny . What 's the best way to get back ? " " Well , I 'm takin ' ye to my place . Got a farm downriver a piece here . Beaver 's nearest town , I guess ye can get a train from there . If the tracks are down . " " Were they washed out ? " " Why , sure . Say , they 's ben terr'ble goin 's on . Down Wheeling way they got gov'ment rescue commissions and what all else . Most the tracks down river ben washed out . I still ca n't figger how come nobody come along and found you sooner . Three days ye say ye ben there ? " " About . " " Well , well . " They watched the heavy currents as the man pulled the boat strongly against them . The river , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still dangerously swift . " Would n't know the old stream , " he said . " Most the time it 's lazy 's a mule . What say yer name is ? " " Scott . What 's yours ? " " Mackins . Jed Mackins . Jest call me Jed . " He bent to his oars again . Mary had not said a word . She sat in the stern of the rowboat , looking behind her at the shack on the island . From this perspective it looked fantastic , stuck on a hummock of land which had caught it square beneath center . Its four corners hung at varying distances from the ground , and smoke still drifted from its chimney . She stared at the roof . Now that it was all past her , she could not believe that she had not dreamed the entire experience . She turned her head and looked at Paul . His face was solemn , and his eyes also were fixed on the house receding behind him . Mary looked at his drawn , whiskered face , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house ; some of James 's clothes . Nobody would believe that this dirty , dishevelled , starving derelict was Paul Scott of Allegheny City ; and as for her  --  She looked down at her scratched and stained hands , and felt of her hair which she had twisted up into a tangled ball . She took a deep breath . The fresh air , at least , was deliciously welcome ; for all their efforts they had not been able to dispel the horrible dank smell in the house . Jed Mackins pulled his boat around a bend , where the banks sloped less steeply , and rowed for about an eighth of a mile along the shore . He ran the boat aground on the edge of a small clearing . He and Paul sprang out , drew the boat up on the muddy bank , and helped Mary out . Jed tied the boat to a tree . " My place 's jest up there over that ridge , " he said , pointing through the bare trees . " Jest up this slope a ways . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground . Paul helped her . " It feels so queer , " she said . " The ground shakes . " " You do , " Paul said . " You 'll only begin to find out now what this has really been like . It 'll be good to get home . " She opened her mouth to say something and shut it again . They walked on slowly , Paul helping Mary , Jed leading the way . At the top of the rise he turned right and led them to a ramshackle farmhouse close to a narrow muddy road . " Here ye be , " he said . " Ca n't hardly see the river from here . Yell prob'ly be glad of that . Jennie ! Oh , Jennie ! " A heavy , slatternly woman opened the door . " Found these folks marooned in the river . They ai n't had nothin ' to eat ' cept sour tea ' n ' taters fer near four days . Got anything ready ? " Jennie hurried down the steps and put her arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she cried . " You 're near starved . " She lifted Mary 's bony , almost transparent hand . " Why you come right along in and lay down here on the kitchen lounge . " As they entered the dark kitchen the smell of stew and of boiling coffee struck their noses . Paul paled , and Mary bit her lips nervously . She dropped down on the carpet-covered sofa with a low sigh . Jennie Mackins bustled about , putting plates and spoons on the table , stirring the stew , asking endless questions full of wonder and solicitude . " Think ye could eat now ? " she asked finally . They sat down to bowls of thick meat stew and mugs of steaming coffee . The Mackins sat with them and watched them eat , Jennie saying , " Not too fast now , yell get sick if you do n't eat slow . Empty stummicks like that . My , my . " She cut a thick slice of bread and handed it to Mary . " Sop that in the gravy , dearie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is saving my life , " Paul sighed . He held out his mug to be filled again . He was amazed , now that it was all over , that his reaction was no more severe than it appeared to be . He had heard terrible tales of victims of exposure and starvation , who held up until help came , and then collapsed in hysteria , coma , or pneumonia . Neither he nor Mary appearedp215to be in the least danger of anything like that . They were exhausted and gray-faced and quiet , but perfectly in command of themselves . Paul saw that Mary was as grateful for this as he . Her apprehension after leaving the rowboat had been pitiful . Jennie Mackins 's curiosity was greater than her husband 's . While they ate she plied them with questions , found out who they were , where they came from , how they had got caught in the flood . " My , my , " she kept saying as they told their story . " My , my . " She made Mary lie down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her until she fell asleep . Paul asked Jed how they could get back to Pittsburgh . " I ai n't ben to Beaver sence all the trouble , " Jed said , " but I heard tell yest'day they 'd be gettin ' through again tomorrer . A big piece was washed out here . You 'd all better sleep here tonight , and I 'll hitch up in the mornin ' and drive you down there . You can get a train to Pittsburgh  --  if they is a train . I guess th ' will be . " Mary slept all afternoon , while Paul wandered about with Jed . " Good to get yer feet on dirt again , ai n't it ? " Jed asked . " Jeez , that must a ' ben a spooky place , that house . " " Spooky ! Say , " said Paul , " you have n't got a razor I could borrow , have you ? " Late that night he and Mary sat alone together in the kitchen . The Mackinses had gone to bed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right ; they wanted to sit up by the fire awhile . Jennie had made a bed for Paul on the kitchen sofa , and one for Mary in the parlor . She had eyed them curiously as she bustled about . It was clear that these two were not married  --  they 'd said they were n't ; but what was there betweenthem , anyway ? Something heavy , something strong ; even a total stranger , crude and heavy-handed , could sense that . She had lingered at the foot of the stairs , looking back at them as they sat by the stove . " Sure ye 're all right ? " she asked . There was a curious , as well as a kindly note of solicitude in her voice . She eyed them sharply . " Oh yes , thank you . " Mary smiled at her . " You 've been so good to us . Just saved our lives , you and Jed . " " Oh , that ai n't nothin ' . No more'n anybody 'd do . Well , good-night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listening to her lumbering footsteps on the stairs , and later above their heads . Finally the house grew quiet . In the distance , if they listened , they could hear Jed Mackins snore . They sat for a long time , how long they did not know . The habit of the clock had dropped completelyfrom them . The fire made crackling noises , and they were both very st ill . Finally Paul raised his head . Their eyes met . Each was surprised at the expression of the other ; the calm , the weariness , the understanding . For years every glance that they had exchanged had been fraught with question , with suspense , with emotion , with longing . Now there was a strange and final quiet . They had made the journey from youth into maturity with agony and turmoil ofp216spirit . Now for the first time they exchanged the wise , weighed glances of adults . They spoke now , to each other , and about each other , with extraordinary , objective calm . Only that morning they had lain together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet people sat and looked past those other two , and into a strange future . " Well , " Paul said , with a sigh , " I suppose we 've got to decide what to do next . " Mary lay back in her chair , her hands curved in her lap . She was relaxed in every bone . " Yes , " she said . And then , after a pause , " I wonder if it has n't all been decided for us ? " " Do you believe so much in fate ? " he asked . " I believe in God , " she said . " So close to us  --  He 's been  --  " " And hard , " Paul said , with bitterness . " He must know why . " Mary leaned toward Paul . " It has been hard . But what is not  --  that is really life ? " " You 're still doing penance for James , " he said . " No . Not exactly . I do n't really think I have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No priest told me that . And yet  --  it was a great wrong , Paul . A great sin . " " You really believe that , " he said slowly . " I do . And the one thing I always did know was that it was n't right for you and me to marry . It was n't fitting . It was n't what God  --  life , if you want to call it that  --  intended . We were trying to put things together that did n't belong together , and so  --  something had to happen . I 've always known that . Ever since  --  since  --  I knew I loved you , Paul . I 've tried to explain it in all those queer ways of mine , through my feelings and my imagination and my religion  --  and all that . I could n't help those ways . I suppose it 's because I 'm Irish . We 're full of notions , they say it 's in our blood . But it 's always been the same to me . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Again they exchanged the deepest of glances . They looked and felt old , Mary thought . When they were healed , when their bruises and scratches were gone , when they were clean and clothed and fed and shod again , they might look no older than their actual years . But inwardly they would feel old . The texture of youth was gone from them . Violence had torn it away and burnt it up . " That 's how I can be sure I 'm right , " Mary said slowly . " That Irish thing , that quality you people call mystic . I 'm as old now inside as I 'll ever be . You see  --  " she leaned toward him again  --  " if I were young , I 'd not be able to say I 'd do without you . Not  --  now . I 'd be greedy . I 'd want more of you . " She hesitated . " But now I 'm old enough to know when I 've had all I 'm to get . " Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Paul . Are n't you ? " " Let me get it perfectly clear , " he said . " You mean that you will never marry me ? " " Never , " she said . He took a deep , unsteady breath and slouched back in his chair , as if something inside him had gone flaccid . He sat there , staring at the fire.  |p217Only  a few unbelievably short weeks ago that statement would have crushed him totally . It would have been intolerable , unendurable , somethingflesh and blood could not bear , a decision in the shadow of which he would not have wanted to go on living . But that was not true now . He sat in the midst of desolation . But the desolation had the grandeur of true tragedy , like eternal ruins of monumental beauty , whose sadness holds a strange , pervading happiness . His was not happiness in any form that could be tasted by flesh and blood ; but he sat in its presence , and it was a fragment of perfection . He was part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange and absolutely true . He turned his head toward her slowly . " Could you believe , " he asked tensely , " that you make me feel happy ? " " Yes , " she said , bending her head . " I feel happy too . " There stood complete the most momentous decision of their lives , with the making of which they had had nothing to do , in words . As Mary said , the decision had been made for them . Their part was that of recognition . To complete the recognition they had needed those three timeless days together . Without the completion of the cycle they would never have been able to see the truth . Now they could see . Now it was clear . Now they must move on , and live . The room seemed quieter than ever. , The mixture of silence and shadows , the soft noises of the fire , the loud ticking of the clock , made a luminous shell of protection around them . They had been cold and harried and tormented too long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a particularly joyful kind of happiness , " he said . " But at least the battle 's over . You 're right about that , darling . May I call you darling ? I 'm used to it . " She stretched out her hand and he clasped it for a moment . " You should break the habit , " she said . Her smile was tender . " What does it matter , " he said , " what an old bachelor says to an old maid ? " Mary started . " You  --  you 're not to be a bachelor ! " she said . " But Mary  --  you do n't expect me to  --  to marry somebody else ? " " Of course . Of course I do . That 's part of what this is all about . " " But  --  " he looked at her , wrinkling his forehead . " But  --  I ca n't everlove anybody else . You know that . " " I do , " she said . " Nor can I. But  --  what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul sat back slowly in his chair , shaking his head . But he only said , " Oh . " " Our love has had nothing to do with marriage , " Mary went on . " We did n't have to marry to love each other . In fact , " she stared at him , " just because we do love  --  we ca n't marry . " " You are so strange , " he said . " But it 's true , " she said . " You must marry , Paul . You must marry Boon . " Her voice rang very low and intense . He felt again that core of steel In her . But he said , bitterly , " Who ? Do you think I 'll have time to go around looking the possibilities over ? "  |p218She  shook her head and smiled , a strange , quiet , sorrowful smile . She knew then , perfectly certainly , that he would marry Louise Kane . He might not know it himself yet  --  but he would never take the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone else ? " he asked sharply . " Me ? " she gasped . " Oh , no ! " " That 's the part I could n't bear , " he said . " If you did . " " You wo n't have to , Paul . I shall never marry . Anyone . " They were silent while she saw him weighing this decision too . Presentlyshe said , " You can see  --  that it 's entirely different for each of us . I do n't matter to anybody but myself . It does n't matter whether I have children . It does n't matter whether I carry on a family name . God knows , the name of Rafferty  --  " she shook her head quickly , and passed her hand across her eyes . " It does n't matter what becomes of me in respect to any outside thing . But it does matter  --  it matters terribly  --  what becomes of you . " " So I should make a marriage of convenience , " he said , tapping his pipestem on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She hesitated . " But  --  it 's our tragedy that you could n't fall in love with a woman who would be a suitable wife for you . I believe you , Paul . You 'll never  --  love  --  her . But you could become very devoted to such a wife . And maybe that 's better grounds for marriage than what we 've got . " " It 's so hard to take all you say and believe it , Mary . " " I know . But I 'm right , and I think you know it . You 'll have to do it . You 'll have no choice . " Step by step she was leading him into her strange , mystical , but rigidly logical world , so logical that it was startling . He was thinking now about this marriage that she was describing as if it were to be the life of somebody else , not of Paul Scott . And after his long silence , he looked up and said , " I do mean to have children . I always did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not sure I want them for myself , " he said . " But I know I want them for the mill . I do n't mean to die and leave that mill  --  " He broke off and put his face into his hands . " There , " Mary said softly . " I 've always tried to say that . And you 've said it better than I ever could . You are the mill , Paul . " Her voice was very firm . " And that 's why  --  why we 've come to these decisions . " He raised his head and looked at the calm , lovely light in her face , and as he did so he felt the very last of the bitter resistance fading from his mind . She was absolutely right . If he was not the mill , he was nothing . And he could not have the mill and her for his wife too . The mill was immovable , uncompromising , fixed ; it was there in Allegheny City on the bank of the Ohio and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Only in another incarnation , in another place and time and world could he marry her ; and then he would not have and be that mill . He sighed and let his eyes rest on her face , more spiritual and radiant thanp219he had ever seen it before . Finally he breathed , " Lord , I 'm tired . Inside . Outside . Tired all through . " Her face , he thought , watching it , came back to earth again ; back to a smile for him after a visible reflection of her remote and austere and consecrated thoughts . She said , " I 'm tired too . It would be nice to fall asleep now and not wake for the longest time . " They smiled slowly at each other again . Sleep meant to them now what it never had before . Even in the throes of their worst hardship , they had learned the infinite consolation of sleep profound with the weight of love . And here they were at this incredible point of renunciation , calm , reasoning , curiously poised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they knew with ultimate quiet born of the tempests that had swept them . Paul could go still farther ; his mind , so firmly trained in the ways of the tangible , the world of strong , clear realities , must move from dreams and ideals and mysteries to the actual . He asked slowly , staring at the red fire winking through the mica pane of the firebox on the stove , " What are you going to do , Mary ? " " Work , " she said . " I thought I 'd set up as a seamstress . I 'm a good dressmaker , you know . " " Where ? " She shook her head very slowly . " Suppose we do n't go into that . I do n't pretend  --  " she swallowed  --  " that this will be easy . " He made a sound . " Oh , Mary . You mean  --  you would n't ever see me  --  at all ? " " It would n't be right . I might n't  --  could n't  --  " she broke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Somehow he recovered and took quick refuge in practicality  --  with which he would surround himself the rest of his days . " Darling , " he said , " you know Father left you money , do n't you ? " " He said he was going to , " she murmured . " I 'd rather not take it . " " I want you to take it , " he said . " We ca n't have any more crises , Mary , and heartbreaks and uproars and tragedies . I 'm asking you to take it  --  selfishly , really . It is n't much money , after all . But if you have that income you 'll never be helpless . I 'm only trying to say it will save me from worryingabout you . Understand ? " " I really do n't want you to be in touch with me . I do n't mean you to . " " Well , if you insist . I would n't be around in person to pay you your income , you know . The bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to start myself in dressmaking , " she admitted , thinking . " That 's better . You know , I could sit here and talk like this all night . I feel so strange , Mary . If anyone had ever told me I 'd sit and talk with you like this the last night before I was never to see you again , I 'd say e was crazy . " " You said I was crazy once . " " Perhaps we both were . " The stove was hot and comforting between them . The clock struckp220one . Paul smoked in silence for a time . Mary sat quietly , her hands in herlap . A cat mewed outside . Mary got up and let it into the cellarway . Whenshe came back to the stove Paul reached up and drew her into his arms . " Tomorrow , " he said , " it will be as you say . Tonight is still mine . "  |p223MARY  WALKED OUT to the entrance hall with Mrs. Dixon and stood for a moment chatting on the stoop in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a black dressmaker 's apron , with its bib stuck full of threaded needles . Around her waist there was a cotton tape with a pair of shears and a small bristling pin-cushion hanging from it . Her shining hair was twisted into a roll high on her head . Her expression just now was serious and full of concern , but her face was curiously calm and reposed . Her deep-set eyes had a quality at once luminous , yet veiled . They were wise eyes , penetrating and sentient ; and they carried the power to parry inquisition . Nobody would ever read in those eyes something he was not intended to know . Mrs. Dixon shook her head now in answer to a question , and sighed . " I 'm afraid she 's very ill , Miss Mary . She wo n't say so , of course . Sheinsists she is only a little upset . But I do n't like the look of it . " " Have you talked to Mrs. Paul ? Does she know what the trouble is ? " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell her , in any case . She'sLouise is not well just now , you know . " " I did n't know . " So Louise was having her second child . Mary sighed . She was glad of that , deeply delighted for Paul . But this was such an eerie way to learn these things which mattered to her  --  in spite of five years ' total separation from the family  --  more than they could matter to anyone else on earth . That was the way she had learned about Paul 's marriage to Louise four years ago ; even the way she had learned the minutest details of Louise 's trousseau . That was how she knew when Dickie was born two and a half years ago , how she knew about the scene Louise had made about naming the child for her father , instead of for William Scott as Paul had intended . That was how she knew almost everything that concerned and happened to the Scotts  --  by piecing together the remarks , the news , the gossip of her customers . Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she was saying , " would never tell Louise what the doctor really says . She would n't want to worry any of her children  --  that is , if there 's something seriously wrong . Or perhaps  --  " Mrs. Dixon paused and ' poke more slowly  --  " perhaps she does not know herself . " " This sounds very bad to me . I wish I knew the truth . Mrs. Dixon , when you hear something more about Mrs. Scott will you be so kind as to let me know ? " " Why certainly . " Her client stood for a moment smoothing her gloves and eyeing Mary under her downcast lids . She could not help speculating why , with all her intense devotion to Clarissa Scott , Mary would not be planning to go to see her immediately on hearing of her illness . But Mrs.p224Dixon , like Helena Trumbull , Janet Burns , Sarah McKelvie , and all the other , women who were Clarissa Scott 's old friends had long ago accepted the obvious implication in Mary Rafferty 's situation  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Scotts after the tragedy precipitated by her brother . Nobody knew the true details of the matter . Or perhaps the Scotts had found the idea of Mary 's presence an unbearable reminder of the murder . Nobody ever said . But they all did know that Clarissa Scott had loyally befriended Mary , had urged her friends to take their dressmaking to her , and had been instrumental in helping her to establish herself in business . Yet , so far as they knew , Mary never saw the Scotts and had no contact with them . It was the natural outcome of a tragic situation . Mrs. Dixon stood on the doorstep and tried to penetrate the quiet enigma of Mary 's gray eyes . " You would n't go yourself to call on Mrs. Scott , Miss Mary ? It might be a real comfort to her . " She spoke hesitantly . " Perhaps I might . You 'll tell Horne 's to send me that buckram first thing in the morning , wo n't you , Mrs. Dixon ? I do n't want to disappoint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . I must have it in time to take away with me on the twentieth . And the two morning-dresses , too , and the combing-jacket . Good-morning , Miss Mary . Lovely day , is n't it ? " The lady stepped into her waiting brougham and drove away . Mary stood for a moment on the step , looking up the tree-shaded stretch of Negley Avenue . It was , as people were remarking in their greetings , a lovely day , one of those rare days when the full delight of the cloudless blue sky , the gentle warmth of the spring sunshine , were unspoiled by the usual pall of gritty black smoke that hung over the city . It was all a question of wind ( unless times were bad and the mills idle )  --  sometimes the city was in pure luck , like today . Mary turned back into the house , walking slowly with her head bent . She was grieved to a profound degree at the news which she had just heard of Clarissa Scott ; that she had been weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be up again . Susan Dixon happened to be the first of Clarissa 's intimate friends for whom Mary had sewed since Clarissa had become so ill . Mary knew that Mrs. Scott must be dreadfully ill if she had given up any effort to be about and run her house . That was not at all like her . It would not be like her to leave things to Louise at a time like this , either ; Mary had heard a good deal about that . Louise , the ladies said , took what they called " delicate health " very hard . Mary could not imagine how they were managing over at Western Avenue . She stood still , staring out the window at the budding tree outside , her mind roving through the minutest details of the Scotts ' apparent situation . She sighed heavily . If Mrs. Scott was in bed with some dreadful disease she must be suffering horribly , and worrying about Louise and the little boy and  --  Mary put up her hand , horrified to find herself wiping tears from her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself . Never , she said stubbornly . Never mind whether the Scotts need me or not . I 'm thinking dreams , not facts . She shook her head briskly and went back to her work.  |p225She  had succeeded beyond her expectations in making a small , separate world for herself . She had settled in two rooms in this house across the river in Pittsburgh , in the pleasant residential district between Squirrel Hill and East Liberty . She had no previous associations with this part of the city and had chosen it purposely for that reason . It was all part of the decision that she had had to make about her work and her future . At one time she had thought of going far away from Pittsburgh altogether , to Chicago , to the West , to New York  --  anywhere she would be a total stranger and could try to start life over again . But she had only two ways of earning her living ; if she could not be a dressmaker , she must be a servant . And she had made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself into the inner life of a family , never again let her heart or her mind or her will become entangled with the deep , passionate currents that shaped human beings to the intricate and agonizing patterns of the lives that she had shared . Some people , to be sure , had busy , externalizedexistences ; they ran large , impersonal houses in which she might become indispensable without making any part of herself a hostage . In such a home in any large city she could undoubtedly have obtained a good position . But when she faced the question truthfully she knew that that was not what she wanted . Her need was for the simple , the warm , the familiar . Too much had been exacted of her in the packed , painful , tortuousdecade since she had cast her destiny among the Scotts . She rememberednow the earliest longings of her girlhood , centered about her hope of lifting herself from the miserable surroundings and companions of her birth . She had taken the only means at her disposal , and she had given , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much . From now on she would live her own life , alone . Independence , she saw , could be the only key to this , and independence she would have . But to achieve this independence through plying the only trade she knew , she must get a start where somebody knew her ; and that place had to be Pittsburgh . Otherwise , she could only work at sewing by hiring herself out to somebody else . And Mary was through forever , she decided , with hiring herself out . It was not an easy thing to cut oneself off from the living human chains that had bound every day and every year of one 's life . Kate was in Pittsburgh , with six children now . There was too the small old familiar world of church activities , modest good works , sociable visiting over a cup of tea . And lastly  --  there was Bridget to think about . Not a trace of the girl had ever been reported by the Missing Persons Bureau . Mary had steeled herself in realistic acceptance of Bridget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her periodic reports of the inmates of vice resorts . Mary believed firmly that some day her youngest sister would emerge from nowhere and when that happened , Mary proposed to be standing by . It was not regarded as a serious matter by the Pittsburgh police  --  this disappearance of a shantytown girl with a street reputation . The slums were full of that sort of thing . The police never bothered houses or their keepers or inmates too much . It was an old Pittsburgh tradition from the days of the Bayardstown Toughs and the roaring wide-openp226thirties and forties that business was business , and morals were morals . Pittsburgh morality was of the rigid public kind imposed by the stern Presbyterian citizens who kept the Sunday laws to the last blue limit , and let the ward boys and Hill girls keep the police fixed up . The mobility of the vice business was one thing that made people in it hard to find . Besides , the authorities had more than once reminded Mary , there was no reason to suppose that Bridget was in Pittsburgh at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or she might be dead . Still , Mary told herself that if Bridget ever did turn up , it would be in Pittsburgh , and if that happened she wanted to be there . That was unreasoning , that was instinct like the same buried knowledge that life in the same town where the Scotts lived , cut off from them as she was , was better than life somewhere else . The one tie that she had kept unbroken was with Constance . So far away in London , so unlikely ever to come back here and stir things up  --  what harm if she wrote to Constance and enjoyed her erratic , spasmodic replies ? Constance let the years slide carelessly by , sometimes not writing for months on end . Then suddenly she would reassert herself by some delightful Christmas surprise . Mary 's two rooms were sprinkled with lovely presents from Constance , like the charming spirit-lamp teakettle and Coalportcups and saucers from which she had her tea every afternoon . There were framed pictures on the tables , mantels , and stands . Constance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a long succession of tantalizing poses . Constance must have a good deal of money now , from her share of her father 's estate , and she certainly spent it tastefully . Her letters , when she wrote them , were largely descriptions of her fittings at Worth 's and Callot 's in Paris ; she went over twice a year for her clothes . Mary put some of the notes about the clothes to good use . She often drew from some pleased customer a " You have such lovely taste , Miss Mary ; where did you get the idea of that bias drape ? " THE BREAKFAST-TABLE had a haphazard look . It was set with the same blue-willow china from which the Scotts had always eaten their breakfasts . The massive knives and forks and spoons , heavily chased and monogrammed , the thick fluted water-tumblers , the high coffee-urn , were all in their accustomed places . But the silver did not shine properly , even in the pale sunlight of this unusually clear spring morning . There was a dull film about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Things seemed not to have been placed in their old precise positions upon the table , but rather slapped down on it here and there ; knife-blades were turned carelessly outward , cups set askew in their saucers . The jam-jar was sticky around its lip.  |p227Paul  put down his coffee-cup with a rattle and laid aside his Gazette . " Louise , " he asked in a patient tone , " is there any way of giving you an idea what decent coffee tastes like ? If you did know , do you think you could do anything with that female ape in the kitchen ? " Louise raised her brown head and sent her husband a frightened , pleadinglook . " I 've tried , " she said weakly . Her voice was slack and thin ; almost a whine . " I do n't see what 's the matter with this coffee , Paul . " She looked at Edgar as if to ask for support . But he was reading his mail . He kept his blond head bent over the letter in his hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louise raised her napkin to her lips . " Oh dear , " she gasped , " I 'm afraid I 'm going to be ill . " " Then for heaven 's sake go upstairs and lie down , " Paul said irritably . " I 've told you not to try to come down if you feel sick . " " But Dickie  --  " She looked despairingly at the chubby little boy in the high-chair beside her . His round pink face was smeared with porridge ; a thick trickle of oatmeal and milk slid slowly down his chin . Louise shuddered , seized the child 's bib and wiped his face . " He makes such a mess , Paul , " she said . The child gurgled happily with his mouth full . The sight and the sound curdled Louise 's shaky stomach . " If you 'd only let him eat his breakfast in the nursery with Margaret , " Louise wailed . " He 's too little to be here , making such a mess  --  " " Go upstairs and lie down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the other end of the table , and sat down in the chair from which Louise had risen . " I want Dickie here at breakfast because it 's the only time I ever see him . " He picked up the stubby spoon and began feeding the little boy . Louise tottered away . The waitress came in , a platter in one hand , a rack of toast in the other . Like everything else in the room , . she was less than neat , less than appetizing . Her apron was spotted , one cuff was unfastened , her back hair made strings down her neck . She set the platter clumsily before Paul , and stood the toast rack nearby . He poked gloomily at the dish with the serving-spoon . " Want some scrambled eggs , Ed ? " Edgar looked up , leaned over to examine the watery yellowish slop in the dish , and took a piece of tough , scorched toast . " No thanks , Paul . " " Would n't you think , " Paul exclaimed , " there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this house ? My God , it 's unbearable . " He fed Dickie some more porridge . " Well , Louise does n't feel well , " Edgar said mildly . " Do n't be too hard on her , Paul  --  just now . " " Just now . I know . But she 's got plenty of servants . She ought to be able to get proper work out of them whether she 's  --  er  --  ill or not . " He stopped speaking as the waitress came in again . " How is my mother this morning , Nettie ? Have you taken up her breakfast yet ? " " Yes . She said she slept a little . "  |p228Edgar  's pale lips twitched . Every time this maid opened her mouth Edgar wanted to shout at her , " Say Sir ! ' " But he restrained the impulse . He spent as little time as possible in the house ; he was almost invariably out for dinner ; he had little to do with anyone at home . These breakfasts were enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five years had all but eradicated the home he had grown up in . Now his mother 's illness had removed the last touch of its former warmth and order and comfort . She had lain upstairs in her bed for nearly three months . The doctor had privately given Paul and Edgar no hope for her recovery . It would be a long , wretched , pain-racked ordeal , and it might drag on for well over a year . Clarissa lay in bed on this April morning and tried not to think about the household or what was going on in it . She had solemnly promised Doctor McClintock that she would not worry about it , or about anything . . . . She heard Paul coming up the stairs puffing and grunting . She knew he had Dickie on his shoulder . The little boy was always crying " Piggy ! " and begging to clamber onto his father 's back . She smiled slowly as Paul came in , and raised her thin hand in its ruffled sleeve to pat the bed beside her . Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bouncing and jabbering made her uncomfortable ; they rang for his nurse to take him away . " How are you today , Mama ? " Paul held her bony hand in his . " Quite well . " She spoke in a quiet , muffled voice , looking at Paul with anxiety in her faded blue eyes which she hoped she was hiding . She was playing the grim , unutterably tragic game of pretending that she did not know the truth about the fate that had overtaken her ; and Paul was pretending that he did not know , and both were pretending that each had succeeded in fooling the other ; a futile , terrible kind of gallantry . " How is Louise this morning , dear ? " Paul sighed . " She feels pretty mean , Mama . I 'm really awfully sorry for her . But why is she this way ? Were you always fainting and , crying and feeling too sick to run the house when you were having children ? " Clarissa closed her eyes with a faint shudder . The last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that her sunny nature , the quickness of her smile , the happy lilt of her voice , would disappear under the first exactionsof discomfort . " She 's so young , dear , " Clarissa murmured apologetically . " But she 's not , Mama ! She 's twenty-eight . Why most women her age have three or four children and all the rest that goes with it . I do n't understand her , " Paul said . " What is there about her that makes you say she 's so young ? And treat her like a child ? " Clarissa thought she had better not say . She could not bring herself to face a truthful opinion of Louise in her own mind . It simply could not be true that this blitheness , sweetness , and childishness of spirit were not genuine ; that they could conceal less lovable qualities ; that Louise would or could knowingly use them for some purpose of her own . She must really be feeling wretched now , and not able to cope with the housekeeping.  | " It 's only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dear , " Clarissa said . " Well , I ca n't see how we are going to go on like this , " Paul said . He looked about the room , which was the only really orderly place in the house , and which , he knew , was kept in order because Clarissa lying in bed could direct the maid as she cleaned it . The breakfast tray stood on a stand near the bed . Paul lifted the covers of the dishes and saw that his mother had hardly touched the unappetizing food . " Look at that ! " Paul exclaimed , pointing to a portion of the same watery eggs that Edgar had rejected . " Just our luck to have the cook leave after you got sick , and this woman is a fiend incarnate . I do n't even blame Louise for that , I do n't think anyone could cope with it . But Louise says if I fire this cook she does n't know how to find another . " " I 'll do something about it , " Clarissa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things even from here . Bessie Cottrell is coming to see me this afternoon . I 'll ask her to go to the agency and find us another cook . " Paul rose . " I 've got to get to the mill , Mama . " He bent over and kissed his mother gently on the forehead . " Sure you 're all right ? Anything I can bring you ? " He lingered anxiously . " Oh no , " Clarissa said brightly . " I 'm fine . Comfy as can be . I do n't need a thing . Now go along , son , and do n't worry about things here . I 'll be up and around soon , and everything will be all straightened out . " Left alone , Clarissa closed her eyes and tried to rally her strength and her thoughts to cope with the day ahead . There was something nightmarish about the way everything had turned out , everything for herself , for Paul , everything about Louise . . . even poor Ed . What was it that kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of going on about making a life for himself ? That slow , gnawing worry and concern never left her . But now here was Louise going to pieces again . Clarissa 's gentle mouth , which was beginning to grow pinched from pain , set in a straight line . Her wide , level brows shadowed her blue eyes in which memory struggled with loyalty , and judgment held the whiphand over both . If her conscience had ached bitterly about Mary Rafferty these five years past , she had tried to ignore it . She had loved Mary better than any soul except her own husband and children . She had , in spite of standards and prejudices , welcomed the thought of Mary 's marrying Paul . And then violence had come , to sweep everything into cataclysm . Mary must henceforward be connected in her thinking with the crazed man who had brought disaster on them all . Clarissa would never stop loving Mary ; she did not want to stop . She missed her now most painfully . The contrast with Louise was almost unbearable . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marry Louise she had had one dreadful moment of shock . She had always been fond of Louise . Once , long ago in a time and a way that did not matter at all , she had joined Sophia Kane in the hope that the children would marry . But when it happened , Clarissa was literally sick . She knew the reason for Paul 's decision . Whatever name he gave it , propinquity was all there was to it . Denied the wife and the life he wanted , he was determined to have some kind of life , some kind of family , no matter what . And to make the least possible effort acquiring them . He had made , his mother knew , a dangerous choice , one fraught with all sorts of gloomy possibilities . Edgar understood the truth too . Perhaps that was why he so often defended Louise ; he pitied her . He and his mother had had to bury their real feelings about Paul 's marriage behind the convenient facade of sentiment . Mrs. Kane set the keynote for them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eminently sensible a thing for dear Paul to have done ; so wonderfully the realization of Richard Kane 's dearesthopes . Clarissa had found it easiest to take her cue from Sophia Kane . She was glad that she had done so when , a few months after the wedding , Sophia died suddenly of acute indigestion . The thought was inescapable that Sophia had actually died of relief . She had closed her eyes murmuring , " Lord , now lettest Thou Thy servant depart in peace , " as if to proclaimthat she had lived only to witness the fulfillment of her lifelong hopes . Clarissa then found herself fully occupied with the burden of Louise . The gentle , sunny , warm-natured girl threw them all into consternation by going completely to pieces , disorganized by pregnancy and seemingly shattered by her mother 's death . All during that crisis she kept harking back to her father , weeping and making hysterical scenes in which his name kept recurring . Paul and Clarissa gave Louise every sort of devoted attention ; they made every allowance for her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louise , and help her with it only enough to make sure that she had her task well in hand . But that was out of the question when the poor child was so ill . Then she made a slow recovery after Dickie 's birth . And then there had been one illness or upset after another , always something beyond Louise 's control ; and not until the incredible day when Clarissa had quietly collapsed beside her butcher 's stall in the Allegheny Market , was Louise faced with any responsibility . Paul and Edgar usually walked to the mill as old William and Paul had walked for years past , but there was no rigid rule about it now . They walked for the exercise and air if they had time , but if they were late , they drove . Today as he came out of his mother 's room looking at his watch , Paul called over the banister to Nettie , listlessly dusting the hatrackin the front hall , and told her to tell Jones to hitch up . This was the third day in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have left for the mill half an hour ago . He hated the daily succession of petty delays that kept him at the house too long . They were all trifles that . irritated him and distracted his mind so that he reached the mill feeling snappish and nervous , approaching his day 's work with tension and ill humor . He started downstairs , but paused and turned back . He felt rather remorsefulabout Louise . She was lying on her bed with a cold compress over her eyes . The shades were drawn . " I 'm sorry you feel so badly today , " Paul said . " Is there anything I can do for you ? " Louise raised the cloth from her eyes and looked at him , blinking dazedly . " Do ? Oh , no . " " Can you lie down and rest here all day ? "  | " Today is Margaret 's day out . You know what that means . " Louise 's voice quavered . Margaret was Dickie 's nurse . She was the only competent and trustworthyservant in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own domain and had as little as possible to do with the three slatternly women in the kitchen downstairs  --  the cook , the waitress Nettie , and the new chambermaid , Nora , who was the fourth in succession in the months since Clarissa had taken to her bed . Paul could never discover the reason for the transitory state of the servants . He could not understand why they were always leaving or having to be dismissed , when his mother had kept the same ones for years . Louise must be responsible for it . In his masculineway he imagined that the house should be easier to run now than years ago as he remembered it in his parents ' time , with five lively childrenand their troops of friends , and a constant stream of company keepingdomestic activity at a peak . " Could n't you talk to her , Paul ? " Louise was asking him . " Could n't you tell her I 'm sick today and ask her to put off going out ? " " I do n't see how I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to do that last week and the week before . Margaret is very obliging but I ca n't ask her to give up her free days week after week . You do n't want her to leave , do you ? " Louise began to cry . " Oh dear , " she choked , " I just do n't see how I can face it . Why ca n't I let Nora take care of Dickie this afternoon , Paul ? Why are you so set about that ? Anybody else 's chambermaid helps with children ! " " Nora is a flighty , irresponsible fool , " Paul said , exasperated . " Neither she nor Nettie is trustworthy enough to mind Dickie , and until you can find a maid I can trust with him when Margaret is out , you will simply have to take care of him yourself . After all , Louise , it 's only one afternoon a week . Good God , some women have half a dozen children and a whole house to mind all by themselves . And Dickie 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be trouble if you felt the way I feel ! I 'm not complainingof Dickie , Paul , but only of the way I feel . It 's awful . " It was on the tip of Paul 's tongue to blurt out to Louise the whole tragic truth about his mother . So far Louise had no inkling of it . Paul and Edgar had decided that she must not know . She was too artless , too thoughtless in her quick voicing of any feeling . They felt she could not he trusted not to break down and upset Clarissa . But a few more mornings like this , Paul felt , would undo his resolve altogether . It was more than flesh and blood could bear , to go from Clarissa calmly and patiently enduringthe torment of a mortal disease to Louise weeping and shuddering in her room over a collection of assorted discomforts that the doctor absently dismissed as " nerves . . . peculiar to her condition . . . some women , you know . . . may improve suddenly . . . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left the house behind them and got on their way to the mill . Today Edgar was waiting in the buggy , smoking a stogy . They started down Western Avenue at a quick trot . The houses set back on either side of the wide street had a fresh ,  |p232swe|pt  look about them this morning . People were in the midst of spring cleaning . The lawns were the soft light green of early April , unsullied by the grime that would soon darken them . Pink and white hyacinths , yellow jonquils , and brilliant blue grape-hyacinths bloomed in stiff , neat patterns in flower-beds and borders . Ironwork gates and fences had been freshly painted black . The busy clip of hedge-shears echoed down the street . The oak and elm trees overhead were soft with pale , newly opened leaves . Edgar craned his neck up at the clean , singularly blue sky , remarking at the unusual absence of smoke . Paul observed the familiar scene in distracted silence . He was thinking ahead to the first question of the day at the mill . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Have you decided what to do about those Hunkies , Paul ? " " Gee . I do n't know . " Paul shifted the reins and leaned over to get a light for his pipe from Edgar . " I hate like the devil to take ' em in . " " Would it really make such a big difference ? " " Enormous . I showed you those payroll figures . Everybody 's coming to it . You can get labor under fifteen cents an hour . . . fourteen  --  twelve for yard men . . . what else can I do ? " Edgar shook his head . " Some ways  --  " he murmured . " I know , " Paul said quickly . " I do n't want to give jobs to Hunkies . And put our own fellows out . But  --  the difference is just too damned big . " There were many features of the big change in the labor picture that Paul did not like to think about . The single most striking development in the past three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swarthy , filthy , unintelligible foreigners from wild places in Eastern Europe that nobody had ever heard of . They were pouring in by thousands , almost swamping the market at slow times , helping to turn out phenomenal quantities of steel when business swung upwards , their sweated wages undercutting the hard-fought scale of the Amalgamated and all the old-established Irish and Scotch and native men . They held no skilled jobs . The Irish had it safe there . Above the level of common labor , yard labor , and the lowest grades of helpers they kept the Hunkies out . But they quickly gave up trying to compete for the lowest jobs at the wretched wages the Hunkies were glad to take . When you needed that kind of labor now you got it not from the familiar Irish and Scotch that had sweated out the iron and steel for fifty years and more , but from teeming labor camps where contractors herded the bewildered hulks of immigrants as they arrived by the shipload . Such a labor contractor was coming to the mill this morning to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lips . He was thinking of Jim Rafferty . " I hate to do it , " he said half-aloud . " Well  --  are you running the mill for profit or  --  " " Oh , I know . We 're not in business for our health . " Paul could not run the mill on memories of Jim . He was learning some of his father 's methods , through necessity and the pressure of the times . He could not be sentimental about mill labor . He could not even keep thatp233youthful , hopeful , impartial perspective about the question with which he used to argue with his father . There was no Jim Rafferty now and his successors in the Amalgamated had not the same meaning to Paul . A year ago  --  in 1888  --  Paul had signed the first contract between the Scott Iron Works and the Amalgamated Association . It did not call for a closed shop , but it did recognize the Amalgamated as the bargaining agency for all union men in the Scott mill . It gave the union the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for which Jim Rafferty had struggled . Paul felt that he had insured peace for a long time to come . But also , curiously , the signing of the contract had once for all made in Paul 's mind a final demarcation between himself as employer and his men as labor . He was as able , as eager as ever to put on overalls and hand-leathers and take a turn on a heat at the open-hearth . He retained all the physical comradeship with the men that his yeas of labor alongside them had developed . But with his father 's responsibilities had come , perhaps , unconsciously , some of his father 's ways . TEN DAYS AFTER Mrs. Dixon had told her of Clarissa Scott 's illness Mary 's doorbell jangled late one afternoon , and looking through the curtainedglass panes of the front door she saw Paul Scott standing on the doorstep . She stood still , staring . Her fingers gripped the curtains and she felt the heavy pulsebeat in her throat . Her mouth felt dry . A few months ago , she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no such idea . The tall man on the step was grave-faced and visibly troubled . Mary 's thoughts turned to the pessimistic report of Mrs. Scott that she had heard when she delivered Mrs. Dixon 's dresses . Her hand turned the doorknob mother . Yet she was relieved to hear herself say quite naturally , " Why , Paul ! Is n't this a surprise . " His heavy hand gripped hers with the firm clasp she had anticipated , and he stood holding his hat in his left hand and looking at her with a mixture of worry and tenderness in his eyes . It seemed as if a different man inhabited this powerful body . His face had grown stern and surpris- ingly inscrutable ; his speech and movements were deliberate . He had grown a heavy blond moustache . Mary realized that he had been full of the same suspense that had set her pulse beating so hard . This coming here had not been easy for him . She waited for him to speak . He stood holding her hand and looking at her with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him come in . He shook his head a little and sighed , " Oh , Mary , it 's good to see you . "  |p234She  smiled and led the way into her parlor . " I do want to know how your mother is , Paul . " He understood that that was why she had let him in . Laying his hat on the window seat , he kept his eyes on Mary 's face and said , " I ca n't believe it 's really you . I 'm so glad to see you . " She motioned him to a chair as she asked , " Is your mother really so very ill , Paul ? " " She 's going to die , Mary . " " Ah . I feared that . " " Someone told you ? " " Everybody knows she 's ill . No one told me what it is . I suppose I 've guessed . " He nodded slowly . He could hardly believe that he was actually looking at , and talking to Mary . She looked much older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or worn . On the contrary her white skin still had its clear bloom , her strong , pale red hair still grew crisply upward from her smooth forehead , and he liked the way she had twisted it high on her head . That made her look older , more statuesque . But her figure was still slight ; it always would be . It must be her expression that was so changed ; it was an expression of the profoundest calm he could imagine . It was a calm like his mother 's , both innate and disciplined . And , strangest of all , in these few brief minutes that he had sat here , she had communicated that calm to him , just as his mother managed to do while he was in her presence . Mary looked up and said , " Tell me , Paul . Is it cancer ? " " Yes . She 's remarkable about it ; you can imagine that she would be . " " Does she know ? " " Only by instinct . Doctor McClintock says he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . She simply knows . He told Ed and me  --  we pretend to her we do n't know anything . " " Oh , I 'm so terribly , terribly sorry . " " It 's very hard on us all , Mary . You see , it is n't as if there was nothing else wrong . " He spread his sinewy hands on his knees and looked down at them sharply ; there was something about the gesture reminiscent of his father . " What else is wrong , Paul ? " " Mary , I 'm afraid the whole situation is a pretty bad mess . I want to talk to you about it  --  I 've got to . But I hate to seem complaining or dis-loyal . " She nodded . " I understand . Do n't you want to smoke ? " she asked . " And I think it 's teatime . " She rose , handed him matches , and moved about in the corner making ready for tea . Presently she brought the tray , with the spirit-lamp burning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She sat down again and said , " Now tell me all about it . " Paul lit his pipe gratefully . It was in just such trifling ways that a woman 's perception of comfort , and of what was conducive to it , made existence tolerable or wretched . He remarked it , telling about the **27;8367;TOOLONG at home , and of the state of things with which he could not cope any longer . " In a way , " he said , " it 's outrageous for me to be here , telling you all this . I do n't like to be putting the blame for my mistakes on Louise . She 's not really to blame . It 's just  --  " He was silent . Mary sat with her eyes turned away . Finally she said softly , " Paul . The only way I could help  --  would be for you to feel quite free  --  to talk to me . I "  --  she smiled a little  --  " I can stand it . And I wo n't misunderstand . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He sat watching her make the tea . Then he spoke , thoughtfully . " This marriage , " he said , " was a job I wanted to do . I wanted to do it well . Frankly , I did n't have any great hopes for it as a  --  a  --  personal relationship . You know why .. But I did think I could put enough into it to compensate Louise for  --  for  --  " " I understand . " " But I have n't succeeded . She has n't . So it must be my fault . If it were n't for Mama I 'd be doing my best to see it through  --  alone . I could n't  --  would n't  --  have the  --  heart  --  the cruelty  --  to come here and dump it on you . " He was speaking with great difficulty and in every line of his face , his clenched hands , Mary saw that this was an ordeal . - " It 's too late to dwell on that , " she said . " Now you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's right , " he said . " That 's why  --  I 'm here . " He stared hard at her . " I 'm just trying to find a way to give Mama some peace  --  all the peace she can have , anyway . " Mary nodded slowly . " And there is n't much I can do about the details , " Paul said , " withoutneglecting the mill . That sounds kind of heartless , but  --  " " You ca n't neglect the mill . That would just be adding another mistake to  --  to  --  " " That 's it . So  --  the point is  --  Louise is incapable of running that house . Maybe it 's just her condition . Something about having a child makes her go all to pieces . " Mary sipped her tea , with a baffled expression . " I believe you , Paul , " she said slowly , " but you 'd think any woman  --  " " You would think so . With plenty of help and all the money she needs . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it were n't for Mama  --  and Dickie . " " How is he ? " Mary asked eagerly . " That 's the worst thing yet . Mary , he was almost killed last week . " Paul 's voice thickened . Mary leaned forward and asked , bewildered , " How ? What do you mean ? " " He was with Louise . " He hurried to correct himself as he saw Mary 's horrified expression . " Oh , I do n't mean  --  But she 's supposed to mind him on his nurse 's day out , and now since she is n't well she says she ca n't do it . It hurts her back  --  or something . Anyway she 's been trying to find a chambermaid she could trust him to when Margaret is out . Last week she had a new one . I told Louise that morning not to leave Dickie alone with the girl for more than a few minutes at a time . And instead of keeping her eye on them , she went upstairs and lay down and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat still , waiting . " And the girl left Dickie alone in the summerhouse . He fell out . " " Oh , Paul . Not over those iron spikes ! " Paul nodded . " He climbed up on the railing and toppled over . A spike missed his eye by a hair . Ran him through the cheek . We were afraid of blood-poisoning . " Mary sat back , her mouth tightly closed . At times during this painful talk she had not had the heart to look at Paul , but now she raised her head and they exchanged one of the deep , open glances that had always carried their intimate thoughts , straight and silently , from one to the other . He sat forward , his hands clasped between his knees , and studied the carved lines of her face , her quiet , intent gray eyes . Then he said , " In a way I feel like an absolute rotter  --  a coward  --  for coming here and telling you all this . It 's not fair to you  --  or even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But you need help . You really do . " " I know it . " There was another silence . Then Mary said , looking at him , " Did your mother send you to see me , Paul ? " They exchanged another solemn look . " Not exactly . But I can tell you she would n't be surprised to know I was here . It was n't easy for her to see you go out of our lives , Mary . I see it now even more than before she got sick . Sometimes when she 's in very bad pain  --  " he paused as he saw Mary 's eyes fill . But she waited for him to finish , and he said , " At times like that , once in a great while , she mentionsyour name . But that 's when she 's in such pain that she 's not thinkingabout  --  me . " Mary turned her head away . Paul coughed and began to fill his pipe again . He said , " She has n't asked for you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things any harder  --  for me . You know her . " Mary sat silent for a long time . The dusk was deep outside now . When she looked up at Paul again he could not see her face as clearly as half an hour earlier . But her voice moved him to the core of his heart as it said , softly and slowly , " I think I 'd do anything for your mother , Paul . " He moved forward , conscious of the heavy , probing ache in his heart and in his throat , as he stared at her in the fading light . She felt pain too , as she watched the sad expressions that crossed his face  --  surprise and yearning and sorrow and finally , relief . " You would ? " he breathed . " My God . Of course you would . And  --  I did n't know how to find the courage to ask you . " She swallowed , and conquered the weakness that might have let her down into tears . She said , " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't make any mistake about that . I could n't be induced to consider it  --  except for knowing how your mother is suffering . " Paul touched her hand for a moment . " I know , " he said . " Believe me . I understand . I ca n't put myself under obligation to you . You know  --  oh ,  |p237everything  I ca n't say . I came here , frankly , to ask you to come back . And now that you offer to of your own free will , I feel as if I ought n't to let you . It would n't be fair . It 's so damned one-sided . " " If you start digging into who owes what to whom , " Mary said quickly , " you 'll dig up everything that 's buried and going to stay buried . " She spoke with quiet emphasis . " This way  --  if I can make the rest of your mother 's life any easier or happier , I certainly want to try . Of course the Louise part of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen about that . She would n't want me there . You have n't mentioned it to her , have you ? " He shook his head . " Well , I ca n't say I 'd like to live in the house with Louise . She 'd want even less to have me . " " Oh , no , " Paul said . " That 's not so at all . You must realize that Louise is a child . " " You ca n't be so blind as that . Louise is very shrewd . " " In a way . But I do know her , I know what I 'm talking about . Life is a story-book to her . You grow up and marry and live happily and even if it is n't really that way , she still wants it to be . She wants everything to be nice and happy  --  those are her own words . She 'd be glad of anything that made it that way . Then she could go on playing her story-book instead of having to cope with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oh , you know . " They sat and thought for a time without speaking . Presently Paul said , " If you came back to  --  you know , to help Mama , and keep house , and all that , it would be very different from before , Mary . You 'd not be among the  --  the maids , the way you used to . " " I know , " she said . " I would n't do that . I could n't , any more . This is so sudden I have n't had a chance to think about the details , but what you need there is a housekeeper and what you 're asking me to do is just that . I suppose it could be worked out  --  for as long  --  as long  --  " her eyes filled with tears . " As long as Mama lives , " Paul said . " After that  --  well  --  " " There would not be any need of my staying after that , " Mary said . " And I would not . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to come back to it . I could never get over being uncomfortable about Louise , Paul . She may seem innocent and childlike to you but those people are always terribly shrewd . She could n't possibly have been as close to your family as she always was and not have heard things  --  about us . " " I 'll try to tell you exactly what I think she does feel , Mary , " Paul said slowly . " She associates you mostly with the period when we were all youngsters together there and everything was what Louise calls nice and happy . ' She seems to be convinced that the only reason you cut yourself off from us all was Jim and what he did . Now if she ever did think anything else  --  about you and me , or if she ever heard anything  --  you can take my word for it she 's forgotten it completely . I mean she 's forgotten deliberately because she wanted to forget . She 's married to me . To a girl like Louise marriage is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never think of yourself or your husband as an individual again . You 're just a couple of mutual possessions . " Mary sighed . She said , " Anyway , you 're trying to tell me Louise is so infantile that if I 'm making the house comfortable and keeping everything nice and happy ' she wo n't remember anything she may ever have heard or thought about our past ? " Paul nodded , rather uneasily . " Well . I 'd better take you at your word for a while . I 'd do anything for your mother , Paul . I 'm frank to tell you I 've been perfectly miserable sitting here for two weeks wondering about her ever since I heard she was so ill . I 'd rather be near her . " Paul looked at her gratefully . " Oh , Mary , you have such wonderful sense . " " I do n't agree with you at all . I do n't think it 's very good sense to do this , but I love your mother and I 'm grateful for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , " she added softly . Paul looked at her with tenderness , dropping the barrier of reserve that he had so carefully tried to keep between them . Mary smiled wanly , and moved her hand almost as if to warn him to remember it . She said , " There are a good many details to think about . " " Oh , fix all that any way you like . The one thing I want is for you to take that place over and run it properly . From top to bottom . You are to be the boss . Hire and fire anyone you want , market , plan the meals , see that Mama has what she needs , get people around who can do their work properly . I 'm going to tell Louise that I 've taken this step to relieve her of all responsibility until the baby is born , and she 'll be so grateful she 'll fall on your neck . You 'll see . All she wants is to be pampered and not have to make any effort . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wonder , Paul  --  this is an odd sort of position I 'll be in . Neither mistress nor servant . I ca n't help wonderingabout the , you know , the living arrangements . I do n't want to have my meals with you and Louise , " she said hastily . She was embarrassed . Paul stood by the mantel and stared at the floor . Presently he looked up and said , " Why do n't you take Pa 's old study on the first floor and use it for your sitting-room ? You have to have a sort of office  --  you 'll have all the household accounts to keep , and bills and wages to pay . You could eat there and have your friends to tea  --  you know , your own private sanctum . And fix it up any way you like  --  with your own things . " He gestured around the comfortable room , with its crisp dimity curtains , chintz and rep upholstery , embroidered cushions and tablecovers all made by Mary . He looked at the dainty English tea-things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shelves full of books . " Bring it all with you , " he said . " Do you still read a lot of poetry ? Or is it novels now ? " He saw several volumes of a new translation of Balzac squeezed between Whitman and Paradise Lost . " I wish I had time . " " I had n't thought of giving this place up , Paul , " Mary said in a low voice . " I 'm not sure I want to . It 's my home . " He turned from the bookcase and took her hands with one of thep239brisk , strong motions that she knew so intimately ; intimately enough to anticipate it before her hands lay in his . " Mary , " he said . " Listen to me . We 're never going to make things hard for each other , you and I. We understand everything , without saying a word . Do n't we ? " She nodded . She had turned quite pale . " Then come back and do n't be afraid . Our house is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without you in it . I need you . I always needed you . " He looked down at her earnestly . " I swear I wo n't let you be sorry . " She smiled , though he saw that she was much nearer to weeping . " It 's like a dream , " she murmured . " It is . Everything that ever happened to us . From the very first . It is like a dream , you 're right . Like the kind of dream that you think about a while afterwards  --  and you ca n't tell what part of it you did dream , and what you remember from ' actual happening . You never know what you lived and what you dreamed . Maybe we 're not supposed to know . " " I do n't believe we are , Paul . " He clasped her hands very hard for a moment , then dropped them . Outside on the doorstep they stood for a moment breathing the soft spring twilight air . It was moist and fresh and clean , but in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , odorous smoke that was native to their lungs . " I ca n't think now why I never left Pittsburgh a while ago , " Mary said . " I can , " Paul replied . " You never meant to . Can Jones come for you tomorrow ? " " Oh , Paul . I 'd be willing  --  but I have some work to finish . I ca n't just drop it . " " How soon , then ? " " This is Tuesday . Wednesday , Thursday . If I hurry I might get everythingdone in two days . Friday ? " " If that 's the best you can do . Friday it is . Good night , Mary . I  --  well , I 'm not going to thank you . I never could . " He hurried down the steps , sprang into his buggy , and with a quick wave , drove away . " Friday , " murmured Mary . On a Friday , sixteen years ago , she had first entered the Scott house . SHE THOUGHT OF THAT first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knob of Clarissa 's door . Paul stood beside her in the hall . Hed come home early from the mill to be there waiting on the front steps ith Louise and Dickie , when Jones stopped the carriage at the gate . t was a strange moment . Mary stepped out of the carriage and stoodp240looking up the walk to the house , renewing her deep , dormant familiarity with every line of its severe red brick and sandstone . She walked slowly up the path , watching Paul coming toward her , leading Dickie by the hand . There was a thick bandage across the little boy 's right cheek , and he looked ill . But Mary loved the way he planted his feet and marched his sturdy legs with precise energy that reminded her of his grandfather . Louise stood on the stoop and watched them . Mary leaned down and put her arms around Dickie . " What a grand boy , Paul ! " She smiled over the child 's head at Louise . Louise smiled back ; a flash of expression which struck Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somehow , on the outside of Louise 's pretty features ; it was not insincere , yet it had no depth . Mary felt unsure of her own judgment when Louise said , taking both her hands , " Oh , I 'm so glad to see you again , Mary . It 's so dear of you to come and help us out . " " You 're looking well . " " I 'm not , though . I 've been feeling awful . " " Well  --  we 'll take good care of you . " They all spoke lamely and with peculiar tentativeness . Each knew that the others were feeling for words . " I like you , " said Dickie suddenly . " You 're nice . " Paul lifted the boy to his shoulder . " She certainly is nice , " he said lightly . " She 's going to be nice to you , and Mama , and Granny and me . " " Not Uncle Ed ? " They all laughed . " Uncle Ed , too . She 's always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edgar ? " Mary asked eagerly . " Why  --  " Paul looked around . " That 's funny . He came up from the mill with me . I thought  --  Hey , Ed ! " he called , going up the steps . " Coming , " they heard Edgar 's voice in the hall . Dickie was still staringdown from Paul 's shoulder at Mary . " Who is she ? " Dickie asked . " She 's Mary . " " Oh . " Entering the house with Louise , looking about in a maze of mixed feelings , Mary 's mind echoed to the child 's unconscious words . What a thing for him to say , she thought . How true it was . Who was she ? What was this uncertainty , this sense of apprehension , this renewal of some early , urgent thought of long ago ? In all the intervening years she had scarcely ever felt like this , not even at that still stranger homecoming when Paul had brought her here to be his bride . In the carriage she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the house , following Louise as she led the way , Mary felt within her own poised , slender body the thudding heart , the choking throat , of the frightened girl who had first come here to cast her lot among the Scotts . For a moment she lost the power to remember the years between . They went into the back parlor . Edgar was standing by the mantel , waiting ; it struck Mary as queer that he should have stayed in here when the others had all met her outside . She ran over and kissed him on thep241cheek and held him by the shoulders , laughing and saying , " Let me look at you , you spalpeen . " Edgar did not laugh so heartily as Paul . He gave Mary a hug , but when she looked eagerly at his face  --  it was so good to see him again !  --  he dropped his eyes in a strange way and turned a little aside . Mary paused , troubled and a little hurt . Was Edgar not glad to see her ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eddie ! She remembered now the queer reserve he had shown the time she came home from London , the last time she had ever really talked to him . She looked at Paul as if to ask silently what was the trouble , but there was nothing to be learned from the remote look in his face . Edgar apparently did things like this all the time now . And he looked so strange and pale and nervous . Mary turned hack to the others a little sadly . Edgar was a man now , a man  --  goodness , she thought !  --  of twenty-five . You could not treat him like a boy . The pattern of the carpet , the slanting rays of the afternoon sun in Clarissa 's old bay-window garden roused the ancient memory of that first day when she had stood trembling before her new employer . Here they were in the back parlor again , she and Paul and Edgar and in some unbelievableway , Paul 's wife and son . William Scott should be here , and his distant elder son ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mary stood and looked slowly about the room . In one glance she was renewing her profound intimacy with it ; and also observing its state of neglect . From the smudges on the windows to the worn edges of the upholstery , the limp , sparse leaves of the dejected plants , the grimy woodwork , the filmy , unkept look of the fireplace tiles , the place was eloquent of everything that had happened to the family . Now the troubled present swept down to blot the memories from Mary 's mind . She looked about and saw her work cut out . Louise was speaking : " Mother Scott will be so glad to see you , Mary . " " I 'll go right up . " Her own words echoed in Mary 's mind as she ran up the stairs . She might have asked to go to Clarissa , and instead she had pronounced her intention of doing so . It was a trifle ; a passing , unnoticed exchange of words , but Mary knew , approaching Clarissa 's door , that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation was to mean : she was , in his words , the boss . She would not ask permissions in this house , she would make decisions . She looked at Paul as they entered his mother 's room , and marvelled that Fate had twisted all their lives into this tangle . Clarissa lay in bed , her pain-racked eyes shining with happiness at sight of Mary . She stretched out her bony hand and drew Mary close for an eloquent kiss . " Dear child , " she said slowly . Mary was prepared for the shock of the changes in Clarissa , and did not show by a flick of her eye the sorrow and the pity that throbbed inside her . Clarissa was so faded ; she had never been a woman of brilliant coloring or striking contours , but now her blond hair had turned colorless rather than gray , and her blue eyes had lost their hue . She had a ghostlike quality which Mary had never seen in anyone before . Clarissa Scott was a tall woman and her figure in years past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could see , the flesh was rapidly melt/ing away and the outline of her body beneath the bedclothes was bony rather than full and rounded as it used to be . Her voice had a hesitant , almost a strangled quality , as if she feared to start speaking lest a paroxysmof pain interrupt her and silence her . But Mary did not show a sign of perceiving all this . She drew up a hassock close to the bed and perched on it , holding Clarissa 's hand and talking softly and happily . " You 're not to worry about a thing in the world , Mrs. Scott , " she said . " We 'll all make out beautifully here together . " " Louise , " murmured Clarissa . Her heavy eyes followed Paul as he tiptoedquietly from the room , to leave his mother alone with Mary . " Can you  --  manage all that ? " " Of course . " They looked at each other silently . Then Mary said , " Please do n't worry about that , Mrs. Scott . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to marry her  --  long ago . Do n't you re-member ? " Clarissa nodded . " I would n't have come back if I had n't felt everything had turned out for the best . And I 'm really happy . Truly I am . " Clarissa pressed Mary 's hand . " You 're a dear girl . " " I 'm so awfully glad to be near you again . " Mary stopped speaking as a change began to come over Clarissa 's lethargic features . The bony hand in hers closed suddenly in a fierce , involuntary clutch . The dry lips set in a grim , ghastly line ; the leaden eyes , sunken deep beneath their lids a moment before , opened violently and stared with horrible eloquence from the agonized face . Beads of dampness sprang out on the putty-colored forehead . Mary leaned forward , mastering her impulse to cringe at this fearful sight , and gripped Clarissa 's hands hard , looking deep into her eyes . Even in the throes of mortal agony , Clarissa conveyed her relief , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she need not dissemble . Mary saw all in a moment what a frightful burden of self-imposed discipline this strong woman had added to the torture that had been her fate . Mary held her breath and did not move while the paroxysmwas violent . Clarissa sagged suddenly from the galvanic stiffness with which she had met the assault . Her eyes indicated a vial of medicine on the table by the bed . " Two , " she gasped , through her rigid lips . Mary put two tablets on Clarissa 's tongue and helped her swallow a little water . She sat quietly until the drug started to take effect and Clarissa 's hands in hers began to grow limp . The heavy lids drooped . Mary did not know how long the seizure had lasted . She felt wraithlike , unreal ; this horrible spectacle had the same effect as some other fundamental and violent devastation of Nature . Clarissa was beginning to grow drowsy , but she murmured heavily , " Thank you , dear . It wo n't be like this long . Later they  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep . Mary folded the bony hands and covered them . She reached under the blankets to feel whether Clarissa 's feet were cold ; slipped one pillow from beneath her head , and tucked another close to the small of her back . She opened one of the windows a little from the top , drew the dark blinds , and , carryingp243the hot-water bottle to be refilled , slipped from the room . On the way downstairs , her head full of plans and her heart aching for Clarissa , she put up her hand , startled to find that she had not yet taken off her hat . There was no use , Paul told her after breakfast the next morning , in trying to be tactful with the present household staff , or in planning to make the changes gradually . " Start in right this minute , " he said , " and turn the whole place inside out . I 'm not going to tell you what to do or when to do it . I 'm leaving the whole thing to you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Here are the account books and the tradesmen 's books . This place has been such a mess that I ca n't make head or tail of the household finances but I want you to figure out a proper budget for all the running expenses and wages and I 'll give it to you weekly or monthly , whichever you like . I just do n't want to worry . " Paul ran his hand nervously through his hair . Mary stood by the desk , looking down at the pile of notebooks and the empty pigeonholes , all cleared for her use . She was about to say that she had misgivings about managing the servants . These present ones or any other Irish girls would almost certainly make spiteful difficulties about taking orders from her . And then she checked herself . Paul expected a task of her , and part of that task was to execute it without involving him in its details . He was in the front hall now , smoothing his derby with the sleeve of his topcoat and waiting for Edgar who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mother . Mary stood on the front steps , watching the brothers tramp off together to the mill . The moment , like almost every tick of the clock since she had returned to this house was startling and disturbing , combining the impossible and the unreal with the familiar so deeply ingrained that nothing might ever have happened to suspend it . As she stood there the thought moved into her mind , into the forefront , the present , from which she had so sternly excluded such thoughts for so many years now . He had said , " I want you to stand at the front door .. after . . . " and there she shut down hard on the Pandora 's box of her memories . . . " and stay there . . . while I start down the street . . . . " She stood looking after him but she could not see him because of the tears that blinded her . She lifted her chin with a straining motion , as if to force down the choking lump in her throat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now that there was no reason why she should not stand here and watch Paul and Eddie down the street every morning . That was the natural thing to do . She saw already that she was going to be having breakfast with them and Dickie . Louise had almost melted with relief at Mary 's appearance with her breakfast tray this morning , and at Mary 's soothing assurance that there was no reason why Louise need ever get up for breakfast while she felt like this . Mary had left her propped among the pillows , eating poached eggs on toast with her old innotent , cherubic smile . Louise would have had a turn if she could have readary 's thoughts.  | The misgivings swarmed thick as Mary descended the pantry stairs to tackle the cook . This was a tall , sour-faced , gaunt woman named Ella ; a devil , as anyone could see . She was standing at the soapstone sink slammingpans and cutlery about in it . " Now , Ella , " Mary began . She hoped her voice had a suitable tone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come over here and go through the stores with me ? I 'm going up to market as soon as we have the week-end meals planned . " " I 'm busy now . " " I want to do the marketing list now , " Mary said . " You can finish up that cleaning after I go out . " " I 'll be doin ' me work when I see fit . " The cook 's tone was vicious and rasping . She had not turned around from the sink and looked at Mary . " I think , " said Mary , " you are making a mistake in taking this attitude , Ella . You and I had better start out by understanding each other . " " I wud n't waste me time . I 'll be goin ' Thursday when me week 's out . Save yer breath fer givin ' orders to the next wan . " Mary walked to the door , expressionless . " Very well . If that is the way you feel , go upstairs and pack your things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Her wet red hands went to her hips in the classic gesture . " Quite a set o ' airs ye got on ye ! Firin ' me , indade ! I 'll take me orders from the head o ' this house and nobody else , see ? Not from no stuck-up shanty biddy , neither ! " Mary gasped . A strange sensation , rather like a roaring noise , filled her ears . Her pulse knocked hard in her throat . Her mouth felt dry . She lifted her head high and said quietly , " Go upstairs and get your things and be down here to get your wages in an hour . If you make the slightest noise or trouble of any kind Jones will put you out forcibly . " She turned toward the pantry stairs . The woman 's coarse lower jaw sagged in amazement . Mary 's knees shook as she climbed the narrow , hauntingly familiar back stairs and emerged in the pantry where the slatternly Nettie was washing the breakfast dishes . From the waitress 's loutish expression Mary could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the kitchen but Mary presumed that she had . She stood for a moment watching the girl listlessly swish the blue-willow plates through the greasy water . Mary could see that the dishwater was too cool , that the girl was not using enough soap , that the damp , discolored dish towels flung on the rack had not been properly washed and boiled for weeks . " You ought to rinse those plates in boiling water , Nettie , " she said . The waitress tossed her ill-combed head . There was silence for a moment . Then Mary said , " I have just dismissed Ella and told her to be out of the house in an hour . If you are not prepared to do your work properly and obey the orders I give , you can go too . " Nettie 's mouth moved sibilantly . " Well ? I did n't hear what you said . " Mary stood by the sink , her pale cheeks flushed and her eyes narrowed . Inwardly she was full of the most alarming starts and tremors ; she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected a certain amount of trouble , but had not realized that she would butt into it head-on the very first thing . " I think , " she said coldly , " that you 'd do better to go right now , Nettie . Mr. and Mrs. Scott are not at all satisfied with you , and I ca n't hope to teach you anything if you 're going to be rude and sullen . " A plate slid from the coarse fingers and dropped on the drainboard with a crash . Mary saw that it had happened more deliberately than otherwise . " I 'll finish up these dishes after you leave , " she said coldly . " Just take off your apron and go upstairs and pack your things . " She had judged that the girl would maintain her sullen silence and do as she was told . But instead she was treated to a sudden torrent of abuse . " Who th'ell d'ye think ye are ? " Nellie spat at her . " Ye 're no better'n me nor Ella . Ye 're only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ye a shanty biddy . Ye are . Fat chance I 'd be carryin ' fancy meals on trays to th ' housekeeper 's sittin ' - room . " She waggled her head and her hips in an indescribably vulgar gesture . " Miss Rafferty ! " she snarled in a high , derisive voice . " ' Yell be takin ' yer orders from Miss Rafferty in the future , ' says he to me . " Mary put her hands quietly behind her and grasped the edge of the sink . She had a sudden feeling that if she did not hold onto something she would find herself laying a broomstick or dishmop about Nettie 's head and face . She had a curious sensation of familiarity with this screaming , red-faced virago ; her earliest years on the Flat had been spent among women who resorted to this kind of scene at the slightest provocation . And even as she stood quietly , aware of her own neat gray dress and black silk apron and shining , beautifully groomed head , Mary saw in a retrospectiveflash the squalid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this riffraff , had sprung . Bridget flashed into her mind too ; Bridget must be all too used to this kind of thing . " Why are ye any better nor us ? " the waitress was snarling . " I s'pose ye were born to a palace and the lap o ' luxury ? Fell on hard times , maybe , did ye , and had to come down to earnin ' yer livin ' ! In a pig 's snoot , ye did ! " Mary moved suddenly . In her imagination she could hear herself sayingblistering things to Nettie , but she kept her face frozen and only said , " Go upstairs and pack . The same goes for you as Ella . If you make another sound I 'll have Jones throw you out . " She walked quickly through the swinging door into the dining-room and hurried on into the study , closing and locking the door behind her . She sat down weakly on the edge of a chair and looked at the palms of her clammy , trembling hands . In all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anticipated this core of poison , this nasty , filthy thing . It came down to one appalling point : Pittsburgh was not a metropolis , it was not so big that one could escape rigid identification with one 's origin ; it was a small town . Any individual who attempted to cut across the lines would be persecutedwith the vigor that characterized the townspeople in all walks of life . She realized now with astounding clarity exactly what would have been her situation if she had married Paul ; what infinite cruelty would have been used , even in spite of Paul 's parents , to punish her . She saw clearly that any Irish servant would feel in some degree like Ella and Nettie ; and practically all the available servants in town were Irish ; and whether they came from Mary 's own Flat or from some similar shanty settlement , their instincts , if not the inevitable grapevine , would apprise them of Mary 's situation . They would never cooperate . The perils of her anomalous position loomed like the genies of a nightmare , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relinquishing any idea of superiority . If she were to eat her meals in the kitchen with them , do a share of the actual housework , wear an ordinary servant 's uniform , give up this little sitting-room with its comforts and privileges , she might manage to get their good will . Presently she was walking nervously , quickly and lightly , back and forth across the room . Her lips were pressed tight together and her gray eyes glittered excitedly . " I wo n't do it ! " she said half aloud . " I wo n't let them get away with it . " She clenched her right hand and beat her fist softly in her left palm , striding swiftly up and down . " I 'll be the mistress of this place . I 'll keep the upper hand if it kills me . " There was a new and fantastic sense of excitement all through her . Scraps of Nettie 's tirade echoed in her mind and at each echo Mary felt as if a stimulating drug were being pumped into the small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she remember a sensation like this , the sense of furiously aroused will power , the eager acceptance of challenge . For the first time she saw just what it was that she had bought with her renunciation . She would never have Paul 's name , or his property , or his body ; but she would make for him the life that she had said he must lead . She would be the successor to Clarissa Scott in everything that gave the Scott house and the Scott family their meaning . Louise did not even count . Besides this enormous and challenging truth the messy jealousies and stupidities of the servants faded to mere petty problems . She stood tense , full of an intoxicating sense of freedom and purpose . Then she flung open the door and started out on her interrupted day 's work in a rush of buoyant spirits . There would be plenty of pitfalls ahead ; not only the servants but quite probably Louise . Mary did not overlook the likelihoodof trouble from that quarter . But she was tremendously excited by the prospect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ability to do it.  |p247A  FORTNIGHT LATER , Mary was writing out , menus at her desk in the old study , now her sitting-room . The room had always been dark and unattractive , with the heavy smell of leather upholstery , massive books , and the cigars that William Scott had been wont to smoke there when Clarissa would not permit tobacco anywhere else in the house . But now Paul smoked his pipe and Edgar his stogies wherever they pleased , and the last traces of William Scott 's occupancy had disappeared from the room . There was a knock on the door and Louise entered as Mary called " Come in ! " Louise walked slowly and with a certain slight clumsy lack of balance which proclaimed her condition to the knowing eye even though she was still quite slender and trimly corseted . Her bosom was unusually full ; it rose and fell perceptibly when she breathed . She sank into one of the armchairs , whose old brown leather upholstery was hidden now by a flowered cretonne slipcover that Mary had made . Louise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and looked slowly about the room . It had been freshly papered with a plain , pale yellow paper , and Mary had found that her white dimity curtains from Negley Avenue fitted the two high windows very well . The heavy tomes from the bookshelves had been banished to the attic and in their places stood Mary 's collection of classics and poetry and religious books and modern novels . Her teathings , with Constance 's caddy and kettle , stood on a table near the gas fireplace , and on the mantel were ranged the ornaments and pictures from Mary 's former home . It was a pleasant and welcoming room though it could hardly have been plainer , and Louise 's eyes roved about it appreciatively . " You 've certainly made this room attractive , Mary , " she said . " You have a gift for that sort of thing , have n't you ? " Mary went on writing . " Perhaps I 'm spoiled , " she said . " I 've got used to having my own things about me . " Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Thursday dinner ? " " Why , yes , I suppose so , if everybody likes it . Why do you ask me ? " There was a slight twist of emphasis on the last word . " I just thought  --  after all  --  " Louise 's mouth opened slowly . " Oh . Am I supposed to have anything to say about it ? " " Louise ! What a queer idea ! Of course you are ! This is your house . " Louise had a way of looking down at her breast , which was always covered with a frill of lace or embroidery of some sort . The gesture hid er brown eyes beneath the droop of her thick lashes . One could not sense hat she was thinking . " It is , is n't it ? " she said softly . It was as if she uestioned the whole statement . Mary looked up from her writing . " Why of course ! Louise  --  that is  --   | Mrs.  --  Look here , I ca n't seem to find the right thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Why not just Louise ? You 've been doing it . " " I know . But it never seems proper to me . One does n't call one 's employerby her first name . " " What about Paul ? " Louise raised her head and stared hard at Mary . " That 's different . I mean , we all grew up here together and what with the twins and everything  --  well , we always spoke to each other that way . " Mary 's voice was especially quiet and casual . " I do n't remember that you did , somehow , " Louise said slowly . " It all seems so long ago . You 've changed a great deal , Mary . " What was she getting at ? What had she come here to talk about ? Mary had scarcely seen Louise to speak to in the two weeks that she had been here . Louise spent all the busy hours of the day in her room , and at other times Mary was almost always with Clarissa . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had wanted to . But now Louise had sought her out . Mary would gladly have avoided her , but she also felt that rather than have Louise brood and grow difficult it would be better to draw her out and put their relationship , queer as it was , on whatever basis of understandingthey could effect . So she answered , in an easy , chatty way , " Yes , I have changed . That was all part of Mrs. Scott 's sending me to London with Constance , you know . " " I see . That was how you dropped your Irish brogue , was n't it ? " " In a way . I did n't exactly drop it . I just wanted to speak good Englishand of course I took the opportunity to learn in London . Would n't you ? " Louise smiled brightly . " Of course . Anybody would . You always wanted to improve yourself , did n't you , Mary ? " It could not be imagination that made Louise 's voice sound devious to Mary , her tone twistingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the more surely it was fact , the more Mary was determined not to show that she thought so . Between Paul 's definition of Louise as a child , and Mary 's knowledge that she was a shrewd and tense-nerved woman , there was a broad connecting measure of truth . Mary closed the menu book and turned towards Louise . " Of course I always wanted to improve myself , " she said . " I do n't see how a person could be born in this country , especially in a place like Pittsburgh , and not be full of that feeling . That 's what we 're all brought up on . That 's the great difference from England . That 's what opened my eyes when I was over there . Those people never dream of rising from the class they were born in . " " You did , though . " " Certainly . That 's just being an American , is n't it ? We 're not supposedto think of ourselves as classes . " " But we do , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mary agreed quickly . " But I wanted to have some education , and be independent . I wanted to go into business . That 's how people get ahead . "  | " Is that why you came back from England ? " " Of course ! " Mary clutched thankfully at the straw so innocently extended . " You see , I saved all my wages in England , and Mrs. Scott used to send me presents at holidays , so after a time I had a little money saved up and Constance did n't need me any more . Then I asked to come home . " Louise sat and twisted her fingers in the lace on her breast . The large solitaire diamond of her engagement ring sparkled between the flounces of her jabot . She seemed to be looking for something to say . Finally she looked up and said , " But this work you 're doing now is n't what you really wanted , is it ? " Mary answered slowly . " No , " she said , " it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw I could do something to help her  --  " A look almost of terror crossed Louise 's face at Mary 's mention of Clarissa 's need . Louise opened her lips and Mary waited to hear what she was hesitating to say . Presently she leaned forward and whispered , rather than said , " Are n't you afraid to be in there with her ? " " Afraid ! Why of course not . I do n't see how you can say that . " " I meant  --  oh , it frightens me to see her . She 's  --  like something  --  " Mary sat very quiet , her spine stiffening unconsciously against this manifestation of hysteria . She had never before actually disliked Louise . Rut at this moment she was shocked and repelled by her selfish morbidity . Then she reminded herself of Louise 's condition . " She 's got  --  a horrible disease , has n't she , Mary ? " Mary rose with a sudden motion and flung open the window . " She 's got cancer , " she said shortly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to now , Mary saw only that she must sweep the miasmic mystery from Louise 's idea of this thing . " Cancer 's a horrible disease , " she said . " But you 've got the wrong idea about it . You wo n't be affected . It 's not diphtheria or typhoid fever . She 's the one who 's got to suf-fer . " Louise said , " I  --  I do n't like to go in there , Mary . I 'm afraid  --  for the baby . " " Well , who said you had to ? " They stared across the room at each other . Louise 's anxious expression began to fade from her face ; she looked at Mary attentively . " Oh , " she said . " You did n't think Mrs. Scott wants you in there ? She does n't . I would n't think of going in to see her , if I were you . It would only upset both of you . " Louise seemed about to melt with relief . " She  --  she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there any more ? She would n't  --  think I did n't care about her ? " " No , " said Mary . " She 's much better off without seeing people . That Is " - her eyes filled suddenly with tears  --  " until it 's time to  --  to send  --  ( or Constance . ... " " Do you know , " breathed Louise , in an awed way , " when that  --  how ng it will be ? "  | Mary bit her lip . If only this woman were not so devious ! You could never take what she said exactly as it sounded . " The doctor says not much above six months , " she said , in the most matter-of-fact tone she could force out . " Next  --  in the fall , sometime  --  I suppose . " Louise settled back in her chair . " I 'm sure it would be much better for the baby if I did n't go in there , " she said . Her tone was normal again , but somehow secret . Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the help she needs , " she said . Louise smiled , her bright smile which for her , at least , obliterated the whole mood of the past moments . " You 're a great help to me , too , " she said . " Where in the world did you find this marvellous German cook ? " " In the Allegheny Market , " Mary said dryly . " Her husband used to be our poultryman  --  until he died . Her daughter Trude 's coming tomorrow to be the waitress , too . " " Well , you certainly have made it nice here , " Louise sighed . " That 's good . " Mary would have shrugged if she had not checked herself . Such a gesture of indifference would be a blunder . " I do n't blame you for not wanting the responsibility of the house , the way you 're feeling . " " Well , I must say it makes a great difference having you here , Mary . It 's much nicer for all of us . " Louise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting at ? It 's as if she did n't mean a word she 's saying . But she only said , " I 'm glad of that . It 's just because I 'm used to the house . But one thing  --  you know , if you feel that I 've taken over anything you really like to do  --  of course  --  " " Oh , no . " A look of panic flashed into Louise 's eyes . " Gracious , no . I hate housekeeping . Thinking what to eat and looking to see if they 've cleaned under the beds and giving talks to those nasty sulky servants . I should say not . I like it much better this way . I have a much nicer time with Paul . " Mary turned to jot down something she had forgotten . " He used to be so cross , " Louise said , " and now he 's ever so much pleasanter . He is n't so cranky at dinner and we have lovely talks . He used to sit and complain all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mary kept her face expressionless . If she showed what she was thinkingshe would either laugh or cry outright . " I hope Edgar is happier too , " she said . " He does n't look well . Has he been moody like this for a long time ? " Louise 's brown eyes were uncomprehending . " Why  --  I have n't noticed especially . " Mary found herself wondering what , if anything , Louise ever did notice . She seemed to be contentedly absorbed in the remote small island of herself , wrapped in mental as well as bodily eiderdown , resistlessly sweet and impressionless as a soft pillow . And yet that was not true . Some signalling instinct , like a muffled bell tinkling in the distance , told Mary otherwise . She only said , " Edgar 's fond of you , and he 's such an affectionate person . I do n't think he 's happy . "  | " He 's hardly ever home , " Louise said uncomfortably . Nobody related to Edgar could fail to have heard something of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was the accepted thing silently to deplore Edgar and his unfortunate reputation while appearing to be completelyinnocent of anything he actually did . " Poor boy ! " Mary sighed . " He has n't any life at all . Does n't he ever see any of your friends , or bring his friends here ? " Louise colored . " Nobody knows Edgar 's friends , " she said stiffly . THE WHOLE TRAIN SHED was aflutter as the gorgeous lady with the little girl , the caped nurse , the black-coated maid , the Welsh terrier , the smart dust-covered luggage , the rolled steamer-rugs , the morocco jewelcaseand dressing-case debarked from the Pullman Palace car , in a whirl of exclamations , excited embraces , sable-tails and ostrich-feathers . Other travellers arriving in Pittsburgh stood about by their sample-cases and gladstones gaping and staring at the beautiful woman who threw her arms first around one , then the next of the party that had come to meet her , calling them all " darling " and " dearest " in a high , crystalline , Englishvoice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , you devil . " Constance kissed him ecstatically . She reached behind her to clutch Clarrie , who stood shyd bewildered with her nurse , and dragged her towards Mary and Paul . ' Here 's your Uncle Paul , darling . And Uncle Ed . And Mary . " Clarrie observed them all quietly . She had huge , solemn Delft-blue eyes almost identical with Clarissa 's . Mary gasped with amazement as the child turned them on her . " Why , Constance , she 's more like your mother than any of you . " " I know . " Constance 's face sobered quickly at the thought of her other , but her attention jumped ahead to the next thing . " Paul , howare you ? My God , you do look old and settled . How 's Louise ? Has n't e had it yet ? ' How do you like being married ? Lester , give my brother e box-checks . Down , Taffy ! Down ! Oh , God , he 's going to be sick ain ! " They all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last of his train-sickness . " He 's been - doing that all the way across , " Constance sighed . " Why did you bring him ? " Edgar asked . " Travel wo n't broaden a " Oh , I do n't know , " Constance said . " Clarrie likes him . Come on , ' s be going . " She stalked off with Mary , leaving the others to round upheaps of luggage , count trunks and noses , and get the expedition under way . Her green eyes were anxious and wet as she asked , " Is it true ? " She pitched her voice low and bent her head close to Mary 's . " Is she  --  " " Yes . I would n't have written you so plainly if I had n't known the end was near . " Constance 's mouth turned down , trembling . " I ca n't believe it . I have n't the heart to face it . " She bit her thin , shapely , scarlet lower lip . So shapely  --  so scarlet  --  Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , it 's not painted ! " Constance smiled weakly . " I saw the look you gave me . " " Awfully vivid natural color , " murmured Mary . " Hot blood , " said Constance . " How 's Mister Giles ? " Constance shrugged . " Do you care ? " The twins talked excitedly in the carriage while Mary and Paul sat and listened . The childhood resemblance between Edgar and Constance had only been striking when they were very animated ; during their screamingquarrels or when they played rough games . Their reunion gave them this stimulus now . Their slanting , curiously-colored green eyes , their pointed chins , their white skin , were amazingly alike . But Edgar 's sandy hair was no match for the riot of Constance 's gleaming curls brushed to metallic brilliance under her green velvet hat trimmed with white and yellow plumes . She wore a dark green broadcloth costume , its tight basque and jewelled buttons emphasizing the tempting roundness of her breasts , and across her shoulders the sable pelisse edged with double fringes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her admiringly . " Gad , you 're a gorgeous sight ! " he said . " Look at her , Paul . " Paul smiled quietly and said , " I see her . She looks too full of hell for me . " " Why , Paul ! I always was full of hell . Why should I be any different now ? " Edgar was fingering her beautiful furs . " If bally old Giles bought you this , I 'm the Sultan of Turkey , " he said . " Personal remarks ! What do you know about furs ? " " Or jewels ? Or women ? " Edgar narrowed his eyes and said something inaudible to Constance . " Boor ! " Constance pushed him playfully in the face with her gloved hand . " I ca n't believe I 'm here . Mary , is Pittsburgh just as dirty as ever ? " " No worse than London , " Mary said shortly . " If your ears and nose need scrubbing out I 'll still take a hand to you . " Constance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's going to be fun being here ! " she said . But her face went solemn . " That is  --  if Mama  --  " she looked at Paul . " Is she suffering much ? " she asked . She was suddenly very serious . " Tell me all about it . " She clasped her hands together . " It 's terrible , Connie . "  | " She has to be drugged most of the time . The pain has been the most frightful torture . You 'd never know it from her . She does n't make a sound . " " She just lies there  --  and when it gets so her eyes are almost popping out of her head  --  " " Oh , do n't . " Constance covered her face and shuddered . " How long , Paul ? " She spoke haltingly now , staring through the window at the muddy Allegheny beneath them ; they were crossing the bridge . " Does the doctor say ? " He made a gesture . " Any time . She 's never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Oh . " Constance thought for a moment and then said , " I 'm afraid I 've been frightfully inconsiderate , bringing all that caravan . I never realized , somehow . . . " She motioned over her shoulder at the hired carriage behind them . Clarrie and the retinue were following in it . " We 'll manage all right , dear . I admit I was rather appalled when you all poured off that train , but with a bit of doubling-up we can all fit in . The house is big . " Mary spoke with authority . Constance stared at her curiously . " It sounds so odd to hear you talk like that . Like Mama "  --  she choked  --  " in the old days . " " I wish your mother were well enough to see Clarrie , " Mary said , shiftingthe conversation quickly . " It does n't seem possible she 's only seen her once . " Clarissa and Edgar had made a short trip to Europe immediately after Paul 's marriage , " to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was the only time Clarissa had ever seen Constance since her marriage . Clarissa had come home figuratively holding up her hands in dismay . " Heaven only knows what she 's coming to , " Clarissa said . " The hours she keeps ! The people she goes with ! The money they spend , and the gambling , and the champagne , and her friends ! " There was always a certain discreet evasion about casual mention of Constance 's friends . Most of them bad august names , but they did not behave augustly in their own circle . Edgar had been impressed and excited . He knew and matter-of-factly exepted the truths about his twin , while other people whispered , specuted , and shrugged . He had found Constance 's life in London so exactlyhis taste that it had been a hard wrench to turn his back on it and gome . Constance had urged him to stay . " Why not ? " she said . " Why gock to that dirty old coal hole and slave your life away ? You 've money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Marienbad with us . Try playingMonte . What the devil is there for you to do in Pittsburgh ? " " Paul needs me , " Edgar had answered almost in spite of himself , surprised at the impulse which prompted him to speak so firmly . " Paul ? Well , good God , whose life are you living , yours or Paul 's ? hut 's the matter with you ? Most of the time you only seem half alive . " Edgar had eluded her after that ; there was something about him onwhich she could never put her finger . He seemed restless and distraught . Constance was so preoccupied with her own concerns that she gave little real thought to anyone else . Her feeling for her twin was spasmodic like all her affections , which swung between the indifference of long separation and bursts of sudden violent affection . Underneath she loved Edgar passionately . Now in the carriage she eyed him sharply as they rattled down the cobbles of Western Avenue . Edgar was pale and a strange , flat , veiled expression came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withdraw from it . His animation and all his teasing and taunting echoed hollowly when Constance caught this strained , mysterious expression in his green eyes . Though careless and self-centered , she was intuitive ; she sensed something radically wrong about Ed . It was not in the least like him to be living like this , burying himself in the family and its everyday affairs , plodding along year after year in the mill . He ought to be off raising hell somewhere . Constance did not believe for a moment that his tastes had changed . She knew him  --  and herself as his twin  --  too well to think that . She leaned forward as the carriage stopped . Her eyes moved quickly about the scene . She stepped out slowly and took Mary 's arm going up the walk . " It looks so strange , " she murmured . " So queer and small . I ca n't believe I 'm here . " She ignored the bustle behind her , the second carriage unloading , her brothers giving orders to Jones and the maids . Clarrie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are we here , Mummie ? " she asked . " Is this Granny 's ? " Constance looked down at her as if she had not understood . " Granny 's ? " she repeated vaguely . Then she jerked her head . " My God , Mary ! Do you realize it 's been nearly ten years ? It sounds so odd to call this house Granny 's . ' " " You were a child yourself when you left . " They were climbing the front steps . Constance looked about with a bewildered expression . Mary saw that she was shocked not to find her mother waiting at the door , though she knew well how impossible this must be . Constance paused on the threshold . Mary felt her hand tremble . Then she said , very low , " Mary , I ca n't go in . I 'm afraid . " Mary put her left arm around Constance , and held Clarrie 's small hot hand with her right one . " I know . You 're thinking about the old days , dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's eyes were full of tears . " He never forgave me . I never expected to see this house again . " She wiped her eyes with her tiny handkerchief . " I did n't know I cared so much . " " Your mother is waiting , dear . " They climbed the stairs slowly . At the top , Margaret , who had been waiting , come forward and took Clarrie . The little girl was so bewildered that she went along to the strange nursery without a word . Margaret made a sign to Mary over the child 's head . It would be better not to suggest that she see her grandmother . Constance stood in the hall , her feet anchored to the carpet . She was milk-pale , biting her lips ; her fingers twitched . She looked at Mary with terror . Mary bent over her and spoke quietly.  | " You must be brave , Constance . You must . She 's been waiting for you . Hanging on . " " Is it  --  does she  --  look dreadfully ? " Constance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does . But you must not let her know you see it . You must n't . Nobody must . " Mary spoke insistently . Constance took off her furs and hat and dropped them with her gloves and purse on a chair in the hall . Then she turned to her mother 's door . Her face was set rigidly , and Mary noticed with amazement a sudden forceful resemblance to old William Scott in the stern lines of the mouth and forehead . Together they opened the door . The close , sickening smell enveloped them as they stepped inside the room . Mary had grown used to it , but she saw Constance 's nostrils flutter , her pale face go greenish . Mary held back and watched Constance move lightly across the floor to the huge walnut bed . The figure in it was so emaciated that the outline of the body was almost flat under the counterpane ; the crossed hands lying on it were like knotty gray claws ; and the face of Clarissa Scott was a mask carved ready for death . The dry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fine broad skull . The lips and nostrils were pinched with the look of death , but the large eyes , darkened from blue to glassy blackness , were wide open , and eloquent with expression as they saw the lovely creature approaching the bed . Mary held her breath , with her pulse knocking in her throat , as she watched Constance . Her white face broke into a rapturous smile , and in her lightest , warmest tone , her voice steady and musical , Constance said , " Mama , darling , how glad I am to see you ! " She bent over , smiling still , murmuring endearments , and kissed the ghastly face on the pillow . Tears burned in Mary 's eyes ; she turned away and the nurse who had been sitting by the bed , rose quietly and joined her . Constance perched on the edge of the high bed , holding her mother 's hands , And listening while the stiff gray lips slowly formed words . " Of course I brought her , darling ! You can see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the way over . And I brought annie , and the dog , and all sorts of presents for everybody  --  we came for real visit ! " Constance never took her eyes from her mother 's face , but t smiling and softly chattering as if nothing in the world had changed nce the last time she had been in this room . " Lord bless her ! " the nurse whispered to Mary . " How can she do it ? " " Do n't let her stay long , " Mary whispered back . " Not until  --  you now . " Miss Calder nodded as Mary slipped outside to wait in the hall for ( instance . After a time the bedroom door opened noiselessly and Conancecame through it . Mary reached her just as she clutched the air with r trembling white fingers , sobbed , and keeled over in a faint . Paul was at coming upstairs . He carried his sister into Elizabeth 's old room and d her on the bed . Mary 's face was streaming with tears . Doctor McClintock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Constance was calm now , extraordinarily quiet , listening closely to every word that the doctor said . She had known him all her life . Once when the doctor came out of the sickroom Constance caught his arm and gave him a dumb look of pleading . " What is it , child ? " he asked slowly . " She ca n't  --  ca n't she  --  say  --  anything ? " He shook his head sadly . " Not any more . " " You mean  --  she 'll never be able  --  to speak to me again ? " He put his arm around her shoulders and drew her gently towards her mother 's room . " Would it help ? " he asked , " just to sit in there ?  --  for a while , for  --  " " If she 'd only been able to speak to me once more , " Constance said numbly . She had her lace handkerchief locked in her hand . " I 'd have come sooner , I 'd have  --  " " Con , " Edgar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so she could see you once again . Is n't that so , Doc ? " Constance drew up her slender body and squared her shoulders and again Mary saw that stern expression cross her white face , so fleetingly but startlingly like her father 's . She and Edgar went in to sit out the night by their mother 's bed . Paul was there . At long intervals he looked up , his broad face haggard , so identicalin bone and sculpture with the dying mask on the pillows that the sight stabbed Mary 's heart . Sometimes Paul quietly left the room and went down the hall to look in on Louise . Her child was almost due , and it had been a month since she had even tried to leave her room . She had preferred not to make the effort to move her huge swollen body . Mary was glad of that ; it kept her out of the way ; just as she was glad of Paul 's abrupt decision two days ago not to wire William and Elizabeth of the imminence of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then have to stay for days or even weeks . Paul had said nobody could endure that . He would be responsible for his decision about it . Constance and Edgar were on one side of the bed ; Paul , and Mary , on her knees , on the other . It was good to be able to pray as she wanted to ; it was good to pour out her heart in prayers for this beloved woman 's good and peaceful death . It was a blessing to be here among those whom she loved above all others on earth . Her low voice was barely a whisper , barely a susurration as she prayed . Her children 's eyes were fixed on Clarissa Scott 's awful gray face propped high on the pillows . Their hands clasped the knotty , clammy claws . lying motionless on the counterpane . Clarissa 's pinched mouth was slightly open , her breathing a faint , ghastly rasp , her tortured eyes hidden at last under iron-colored lids . All pretense about prolonging her life was abandonednow . Constance was able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directions to Miss Calder  --  " Do n't let her come out again  --  give it as necessary  --  " " Ca n't you  --  could n't you  --  ? " Constance touched the doctor 's arm . " What , child ? " He looked down at the slender figure poised on the edge of the chair . The red curls were disordered , the green eyes heavy with strain and tears.  |p257The  scintillating beauty and arrogance were gone from Constance 's white face and in it the old doctor saw the strong passions of temper and wilfulnessdisciplined to bravery . Edgar came over from the doorway , stood behind his sister , and put his hands on her shoulders . Both twins gazed intently at their dying mother . The doctor shook his head slowly . In this room , in this bed , exactly a quarter of a century ago , he had brought these children into the world for this fine and loyal and gentle woman . He thought of that painful and difficult birth , quietly borne like this dreadful death . The shocking contrast with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He bent over Constance . " What , child ? " " Could n't you  --  make it happen  --  sooner ? Would n't it be kinder ? " He nodded slowly . " It is happening now , Constance . She can not feel any more . She does n't know . Believe me , she will not suffer any more . " " We are feeling it now , Con . " Edgar spoke quietly . The doctor watched their hands knot together , their thin faces set in identical lines . He knew the anxiety these two had caused their mother , the pitfalls into which they had flung themselves rather than take heed or accept restraint . Yet they had quality ; stern nerves to meet ordeals without flinching . Doctor McClintockreflected on the mystery of twins . These two were as close as the day he had taken them from Clarissa . Only a little while later there was a silent change ; a difference in the doctor 's face ; a solemn remote dignity in the sad nurse 's as she stepped forward and drew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Constance on one side of the bed , Paul on his , put out their hands and clasped them all together over their mother 's . With their eyes fixed on the dying face Mary saw the pinched nostrils move in the faintest degree . There was no sound but the infinitesimal whisper of Mary 's prayers . She saw Paul move his left arm and felt it go hard and steady around her own shoulders , his left hand doubling over her clasped ones while his right still held his mother 's . Clarissa 's last breath drifted quietly through her lips . Her children were silent and Mary went on praying . DINNER WAS OVER . Elizabeth rose from her mother 's old place opposite Paul and led Constance and Julia from the dining-room . Edgar went to his humidor for cigars , and Trude placed before Paul the decanters of port and brandy from the sideboard . The old days of William Scott 's militant teetotailingwere long forgotten , but the brothers exchanged glances of faint amusement as they gathered about the head of the table and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the port . The men smoked in rather awkward silence . This whole gathering had been an ordeal difficult far beyond the strain of Clarissa Scott 's death . Her brother Staunton Haynes sat here now , tall and graciously white-haired , scrutinizinghis three nephews quizzically . He had hardly seen them since their childhood , when Clarissa used to bring them East for the summer , and he would visit with them briefly . Only insofar as they resembled his sister could he feel any link to them . It struck him now that where Paul was the only one of the three who resembled his father in manner and character , he was also the only one who really looked like his mother . The other two were curiously negative . William ( his Uncle Staunton had used to call him Billy ) seemed unrelated to every person and every emotion in this house , while Edgar possessed an intangible quality which Haynes described to himself as lost . He studied Edgar behind this thin hand . His nephew was handsome , strikingly so ; but in too attenuated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attractivenesswhose full impact was somehow weakened and dispersed at one 's point of contact with it . Haynes had shrewdly noticed in his two days here how great was Paul 's attachment to Edgar , almost a paternal attachment which had its dependent element too . And Edgar , while reciprocating to the utmost , while making himself indispensable to Paul , seemed neverthelessuncertain , unfulfilled ; subtly unsatisfied . He was a troubled and a secretly unhappy young man . Even the consolation of reunion with Constancehad not dispelled the nebulous inquietude of Edgar 's spirit  --  a sad quality that had nothing to do with his grief for his mother . Edgar spoke to Haynes now , leaning across the corner of the table . " You know , Uncle Staunton , I never knew until yesterday how you helped Connie after she was married . That was splendid of you ! " " Oh no , Ed . I was glad to do it for your mother . It was her money , after all . She just could n't exactly use it as she wished while your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it for long . " " No , but it was damned fine of you just the same . Con never knew about it either . She was awfully touched yesterday when the will was read . " " Ed , " said his uncle suddenly , " why do n't you go home with Constance when she sails ? Pay her a good long visit . It would do you good . " Edgar 's face grew masked . One eager flash of his green eyes was obliterated by a pinched and resigned expression . He rolled his cigar nervously between his fingers . " I 'd like it , Uncle Staunton . Con 's spoken of it already . But  --  I ca n't . " " Why not ? " " Oh , I could n't leave Paul now . He 's going to need a lot of help . He 's been terribly held down with everything at home here and now that Mama 's  --  that the suspense is over , we can throw ourselves into things at the mill . We need to , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Business is booming , you know . " " Is that so ? " William drawled across the table . " Is business as good at all that ? " " Tremendous , " said Paul . " Blast furnace production in town has broken every previous record and in our mill I should say the sky was the limit  --  as far as our alloys are concerned . "  |p259The  men drew their chairs closer , interested and thoroughly relieved to have the talk turn on this , their only possible interest in common , and their only conversational refuge from their sad business here . " Are you going to increase your variety of alloys ? " asked Nicholas . " Oh , certainly . Ed , I showed you that paper of Riley 's about nickel steel that he read to the British Institute ? They presented it as a great departure , " Paul explained , " and we 've been making open-hearth nickel steel for nearly three years now . " " I wonder what effect Captain Jones 's death will have on Edgar Thomson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between his slender white fingers . William , in the few years since his removal to the bosom of Julia 's family , was a changed man . Nobody knew or cared to discover what his troubles with his father-in-law must have been during the first three years of his life in Boston . But at the end of that time Laurence Gaylord had ( lied , leaving his only child a fortune in millions . The investments were astutely divided between the most conservative possible securities , and holdings in such skyrocketing phenomena as railroads , steel , coal , and the industries related to them . It had been in the search for just such an investment that Laurence Gaylord had first hit upon the Scott Iron Works . Now William , though subject to the judgment of two cold-blooded Boston financiers as co-trustees , was one of the administrators of this fortune compared to which his own partnership in the Scott mill was negligible . William had taken on lustre in the reflection of his wife 's money , and with the lustre went a kind of assurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ importance . In William it seemed mere bombast . Contact with huge and potent sums of money and intimate knowledge of the ruthless ways in which financial battles were fought had quickly hardened him and obliterated his youthful uncertainty . On the other hand , the veto of his two co-administrators hung always over any absolute decisionhe might wish to make . Paul saw that Bill intended , whether cannily or not , to keep as closely informed about the mill as he could . That was the sole way in which he could demonstrate a special right to impose his judgment on his colleagues . It was also the only field in which he might ever hope to assert himself apart from them . Paul saw this while William asked unexpectedly trenchant questions about the inventories , the output , the profits , the liabilities , and the future plans of the mill . Paul answered as openly and willingly as he could , though with an uneasy sense that Bill 's interest was not based on true concern for the family business . But Paul would never have challenged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Paul was determined that they should stay asleep . He had watched narrowly when William and Julia had steepped from the carriage on arriving at the house day before yesterday . Mary had emerged from her sitting-room just as they were laying off their wraps in the hall . Her hands were full of mail and telegrams . William could not conceal his consternation at seeing her . Paul observed it plainly . " Mary has come back to help us out , Bill , " Paul had said , in the most natural tone he could muster . " She has been a godsend to Mama . "  | " How are you , Mister William ? " Old habit stood comfortably by Mary . She knew what must be transpiring in William 's mind . " Very well , thank you . " " How do you do ? " said Julia stiffly . " Very well , thank you , Mrs. William . How are the children ? " " Well , thank you . " Mary had not prolonged the encounter a moment . With a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about her business . Paul had been left to face his brother 's silent , startled discomfiture . " Mary is running the house for Louise now , " he said . " We 've had a pretty difficult time this past year and I do n't know what we 'd have done without her . " " Do you mean to say she lives here again ? " William had spoken in the solemn shocked whisper that seemed appropriate to all the circumstances  --  the house in mourning , Louise upstairs in bed , and this unbelievable reappearanceof Mary Rafferty . " Why of course . " Julia at that point had made a conspicuous move towards the back parlor , saying , " I must go and see Elizabeth . I expect she 's in there . " But William had stood dumbly in the hall with Paul , looking uneasily up the stairs as if Mary 's presence there was a threat to the very structure of the house . " Why , " he mumbled uncomfortably , " why , Paul . I  --  er  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I were you . We are making out very well and Louise is especially contented . " Paul spoke with emphasis . He could see that William would not comprehend more than a hint of his meaning , but he could also see that the less his brother had to do with this house the more secure he would feel . Paul was reflecting on that this evening while he refilled William 's glass at the table , and kept the conversation on the steel business . In the drawing-room the three women made a strange picture . Elizabeth and Constance were so extraordinarily unlike that no eye could suspect their relationship . Both were dressed , of course , in mourning black . But Constance by her very vividness dramatized the stark lines of her dull black silk gown . Her sister could not know that Premet had only finished this simple masterpiece in time to deliver it to Constance on the ship . In spite of her strained pallor and the blue circles under her eyes , Constance was paganly beautiful . Her belted waist was small and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black collar a sculptured flower nodding on a dark stalk . Her glittering eyes were quiet behind her narrowed , slanting lids . She made Elizabeth feel ponderous and stupid , just because Constance sat so gracefully on a small , fat , tufted green satin chair , her elastic body seeming hardly to touch the furniture . Elizabeth was neither dull nor heavy ; on the contrary , she had the same angular vigor that had carried her tireless through miles of good works all the years of her girlhood in Pittsburgh . But every line of her hard merino dress , every twist in her sandy , rather oily hair , the frank hygienic scrubbedness of her sallow skinp261were mute reproof to Constance . Elizabeth honestly considered her sister 's whispered reputation a public scandal , and was miserably ill at ease . She could not imagine what one talked about with a woman who flouted all one 's notions of decency . By Elizabeth 's code Constance should be paying in bitter coin the price of her delinquencies , and instead she seemed to bask in the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much as outraged , something in her scheme of things was gravely awry . Even in her most secret thoughts she could not admit it exciting or enviable that Constance should shine so frivolously in so exalted a setting . But Julia could . She had not forgotten her original pleasure in contrivingthe marriage of Constance and Giles , that pleasure compounded of snobbery and spite . Julia also enjoyed reflected celebrity . Even if the celebrity verged on notoriety it still emanated from a very impressive source . So she could sit here on the high-backed sofa , secure in her magnificenceof money , flesh ( she had begun to solidify markedly ) and dowdy , expensive clothes , and cynically observe the reunion of her two sisters-inlaw . She drew a bone of possible contention from the devious receptacle of her mind and threw it to the sisters . " Were n't you surprised to find Mary Rafferty in the house again when you arrived ? " she asked . Elizabeth 's thin mouth twitched . Constance raised her red head with her old gesture of defiance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Certainly not ! " snapped Constance simultaneously . Julia reacted volubly . " I was , " she said . Her eyes moved slowly from one face to the other . They held a searching question . " Would n't you think , " she said , lowering her voice , " that Louise would have objected strongly ? After all  --  " " After all , what ? " Constance thrust her chin forward . " Well  --  " Elizabeth started to speak , thought better of it , and looked at Julia . " Well  --  " Julia could not decide whether to put her insinuations into words or leave them hanging . William had never told her exactly what he knew of the matter between Paul and Mary . He would have died rather than tell . He had undergone humiliation enough at his father 's and Paul 's hands , and his situation with Laurence Gaylord had been difficult enough when he first went to Boston , without emphasizing the prospect of his brother 's marriage to a servant . Old Gaylord would as soon have discussed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cesspool . So she had really never been told what her father and her husband knew . All her thoughts on the subject , and they had been many and lingering , had been such as to invest it only with shameful innuendo . " Well , I must say I would not have it in Louise 's place , " she said . " Have what ? " Constance managed to speak in a tone as tough as a schoolboy 's . Julia and Elizabeth exchanged a glance of exasperation . " Really , Constance , " Elizabeth looked down at her clasped hands , " you a n't pretend you never noticed any , er , anything .... " " I never went snooping and hinting things about people I loved , ifp262that 's what you mean , " Constance said . She thought suddenly of her cigarette case upstairs , filled with tiny Turkish paper-tipped tubes . How she would love one now ! She twiddled her white fingers against her skirt . She would deliciously relish shocking the eyebrows off of Lizzie , but on second thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mother 's and for Mary 's sake . She rose and stood with her back to the fireplace . " I had a talk with Louise this afternoon , " Julia said , ignoring Constance'sretort . " I went up and sat with her while you were all down at the bank . I declare I ca n't understand her . She seems to like Mary . She lies there and lets Mary wait on her and fuss over her  --  it 's positively unbelievable . " " Why ? " asked Constance acidly . " Why is it unbelievable for Mary to devote herself to Louise and expect to bring up her children ? That 's what she 's always done here . " " Well , of course , if you wo n't see what I mean , I ca n't tell you , " Julia said . She settled her long gold watch-chain and tucked her watch deeper in her belt . " I can see that Louise is a featherwitted ninny who 's always made coweyesat Paul and is n't any more fit to bring up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damned lucky to have Mary here and she knows it . " Constanceignored the horrified winces that her profanity evoked . " Louise is wildly in love with Paul and  --  " " Paul is surely just as much in love with her , " Julia interpolated . Her sarcastic tone was a blend of butter and vingar . " Like  --  " Constance swallowed . She started to swear again , but caught herself . " Like thin air he is . " " Ah , then , you do see what we 're talking about , " Julia murmured . " Where is this getting you ? " Constance asked Julia . She turned to Elizabeth . " Either of you ? What possible reason can you have for trying to stir up jealousy and wretchedness around Paul ? Ca n't you leave him alone to work out his own life ? My God , it 's nauseating ! " Elizabeth moved her shoulders stiffly . " I for one think it nauseating , in your words , for him to have that woman here right under the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's  --  " " That woman , ' " snapped Constance , " is the best friend I ever had or Mama ever had , and if you 'd been half the daughter to Mama that she always was  --  oh , you make me tired . You do n't know the first thing about life . You 're a walking Sunday-school lesson , complete with hypocrisy and mottoes . " Julia sniffed . " I do n't see why you stand for this , Elizabeth . " " What can she do ? She knows it 's true . There is n't a spark of warmth or charity in her . Even poor Louise , that cushion-wit , has more human understanding than Lizzie . " Elizabeth 's pale face reddened . She bit her lips and nervously claspedthe arms of her chair . But she said nothing . Constance and Julia both sawthat she was giving a demonstration of fortitude and self-control . " I do n't agree with you about Louise , " Julia said . She kept worryingp263the subject like a dog a bone . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything ? Or does n't care ? " " What if she has ? She 's married to Paul now . That 's what matters to her . And she at least credits him with honorable instincts whether you do or not . " Elizabeth 's mouth opened at last . " Are you a competent judge of honorableinstincts ? " she asked Constance , with stiff lips . Constance laughed and shrugged . Julia sat shaking her head . " I still ca n't understand it , " she said . " You would n't , " Constance retorted . At that point the men came in . Paul walked over to the fireplace and put his arm around Constance . " You two seem to be up to your old ways again , " he said , looking from her to Elizabeth . " Oh , we 're just agreeing to disagree . " Both Benjamin Nicholas and William went to sit close to their wives , as if to protect them from dire influences . Elizabeth 's flushed face was really pathetic and she gave her husband a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay in Pittsburgh any longer than necessary . The last document requiring Elizabeth 's signature had been signed this evening before dinner . The Nicholases would be leaving soon now to take the night train back to New York . The William Scotts were going with them . But itas not time to leave yet . There was at least an hour more to be disposed f before they could escape upstairs and collect their belongings for the gurney . William looked curiously about the room . " Do you realize , " he said slowly , " that this is the only time we have I been together here since Constance and Giles eloped ? " Constance shrugged . " What a thing to commemorate ! " she said . Edgar took his head at her . He did not want her to show off as she loved to do r mischief 's sake , and shock the family into deeper antagonism . He was ry sensitive to Constance 's brittle sarcasm . He hated her to display bad te . It was too easy for her to have fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elopement . " Why did you do it , anyway , Con ? I never could see why , even when went on that goose-chase that night . " " I wanted to live , Bill . Not necessarily with Giles  --  " " Constance ! " Elizabeth 's face was crimson . " Oh , that 's not what I mean , " Constance said carelessly . " But I 'd have rried anything in shoes to get away from here . " " You did n't have such a bad life , " said Edgar reproachfully . " No , I did n't . I wish  --  " Constance paused and turned her head away if concealing that she was in pain . Her hand brushed her averted eyes . wish I 'd had the sense to stay with Mama longer while I had her . That 's only thing I feel badly about . " She choked . Elizabeth moved uncomfortably . She had been desperately afraid that e time during the family gathering somebody would do just this -- visiblyand audibly express grief for her mother and thereby imperil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their feel- ings . At least Elizabeth presumed that they preferred this  --  she did , Williamdid ; Paul could act as if he did ; but those appalling twins ! They were just as likely to throw emotional bomb-shells as they had been to put a litter of mice in her bed twenty years ago . Everything about this gatheringmade Elizabeth wretched . She mourned her mother as sincerely as any of the others , but mourning , by her ideas , should be a matter of deep inner feeling , outward solemnity and impassivity , and no manifestations of hysteriawhatsoever . She had hoped to escape anything like that during her mother 's funeral . Her mother 's death at least had had none of the melodramatichorror of her father 's . Elizabeth would never get over the awful memory of that . And not only Constance  --  all the rest of them made her uncomfortable . She thought she detected a fleeting glance of satirical amusement every time her Uncle Staunton 's eyes met hers . In spite of her apparent siding with Julia in the matter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whenever Julia spoke of her two children she did so with a veiled but prying glance at Elizabeth 's flat , angular figure . Six years of marriage , after all , and she had n't given a sign .... Elizabeth could hear Julia voicing such speculations to any interested party . Elizabeth herself did not know why she had no children . She did not think of herself as sterile in body any more than in mind and heart ; she was unaware of the truth so obvious to Constance and to Mary . They had been remarking it together in the privacy of Constance 's room when Elizabeth had gone in there late last night to speak to her sister . She had not expected to find Mary there . She had not even definitely planned what she would say when she went in . But she had succumbed to a vigorous impulse of curiosity ; she could only guess at the luxury with which Constance probably surrounded herself and she wanted to see it at first hand . She found Constance sitting up in bed in a cloud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Mary had brought her . Her red curls tumbledbrassily over the pale blue marabou bedjacket across her shoulders . Beneath it Elizabeth glimpsed a web of filmy lace and transparent silk and beneath that , the appalling , the incredible sight of Constance 's pearly globular breasts . Elizabeth blushed furiously ; she could see the deep pink nipples right through the lace ! Constance seemed utterly unconscious . Mary , who had been ( at Constance 's insistence ) perched on the foot of the bed , stood up and took the empty glass and bent over Constance for a moment . She pushed the brilliant hair back from Constance 's forehead , and looked at her anxiously as she bent over to kiss her good night . " Are you all right , dear ? Can you sleep ? " Constance nodded , her hand in Mary 's . " You 're wonderful , Mary . I 'd have died without you . " They kissed tenderly . " Good night , dear . Call me if you want anything . " " Can we get Clarrie back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at admitting that she missed her child . " I 'd like her with me . " The children and their nurses had been sent across the street to Mrs. Burns.  |p265Mary  nodded , straightened a lampshade , and left the room . Constance looked up curiously at Elizabeth . She had not failed to notice her sister 's prominent gray eyes roving about the room , taking in the gold toilet articles and the glittering row of crystal bottles on the dressing-table ; the morocco jewel-box ; the tooled and crested leather writing-case on the desk between the windows ; the opulent pale blue satin dressing-gown and the delicate hand-made matching slippers by the armchair ; the washstand covered with pots and bottles and jars of Parisian cosmetics . Elizabeth in the midst of this , thought Constance , looked like a seamy old crow . And she was only thirty-one ! The sisters regarded each other in embarrassed silence . Elizabethnow had nothing to say . There was a light tap on the door and Constance 's maid came in . " Will you need anything more tonight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Go to bed . " " Thank you , Madam . Sha n't I brush your hair first , Madam ? " Constance shook her head . " No , I have n't the patience . Go along , Lester . " " Very good , Madam . " The maid went to the wardrobe , took out some clothes from what , Elizabeth could see , was an amazing array of rich fabrics and furs , and carrying them away for attention , withdrew . The silence after that was more awkward still . Elizabeth felt as if she were a spectator at a Pinero play . " Well , " she said in her flat voice , " I just came in to say good night . " Constance wished there were anything else to say . She did not want to show her indifference to Lizzie . But she would have felt more at ease with the utmost stranger . " That was nice of you , Liz . " Constance spoke gently . She was drowsy . Mary had obtained a powder from Doctor McClintock , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pity we 've only got a tragedy to bring us together again . " " It is . Tell me , Constance  --  did Mama know you when you got here ? " " Just for a moment . Only a moment . " Constance bit her lips hard . She did not want to cry . Elizabeth did not want her to . Constance was afraid then that her sister was going to kiss her . But Elizabeth did not . She only said , " Well , I do think Paul might have let me know in time to get here . " " Do n't be bitter about it , Liz , " Constance said . " Nobody could help it  --  it just happened that way . I 'd been a long time on my way . " Elizabeth turned to go . " Well , " she said tonelessly , " good night , Constance . " " Good night . " It was such chasms , Elizabeth sat thinking , which penetrated the whole life of her family , and kept each of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little island of his own . She could not remember when these sharp divergencies of taste and personality had first impressed themselves . It seemed in retrospect that they had all had quite a normal , congenial childhood together . Now she looked at them wonderingly . William , with his lifelong aptitude for saying the wrong thing , was remarking in an artificialp266way , " Just think , if Paul were n't the arbiter of our financial destiny , we might never have any reason for all meeting together again . " Constance was irritated by his tactlessness . She showed it by making an ill-natured remark herself . " I ca n't imagine why I 'd ever come back again once I get home to London , " she said . " Any of you who want to see me can come over there . " They all looked uncomfortable . Elizabeth eyed her husband , hoping that he would draw his bulky watch from his pocket , consult it , and signal her that the time had come to leave . Julia moved her plump shoulders and made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position it was hardly necessary or justifiable for him to display his resentment over Paul 's authority . Edgar was sitting in the corner with his head bent and his hands rammed in his pockets ; he had spoken only once since leaving the diningroom . And Uncle Staunton , who made Elizabeth almost as uncomfortable as Constance did , was stretched back in his armchair , his slender ankles crossed , his thin hand with its heavy seal ring delicately posing his cigar . He was gazing at the ceiling . Paul had drawn a sheaf of papers from his breast pocket and was looking them through , making sure that his brothers and sisters had not overlooked any detail of estate matters requiring their signatures . " Paul . " Some of them started as they heard Mary 's low , lilting voice in the doorway . William and Julia and Elizabeth even winced . To them there was something inexpressibly shocking in Mary 's calm , natural addressing of Paul by his Christian name . They looked at her stonily . Constance looked too , thinking as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shining hair above the cameo face , how utterly a part of the real life of this house Mary was , and how false were the natures and personalities who repudiated her . " Paul , Louise is waiting for you to come up and say good night . She ought to go to sleep now . " Paul stood up quickly . " I 'll be down presently . " He excused himself to the family and left the room with Mary . The others all sat in silence , listening to the double footfalls , light and heavy , going up the stairs . THE CRY ECHOED sharply down the hall . Paul and Edgar and Constance were in the back parlor after dinner , Paul in his father 's easy-chair with his pipe and a stack of metallurgical journals , the twins playing bezique . The Nicholases and the Williamses , as Constance called them , had been gone for several days and peace had settled over the house ; but it was ap267tenuous peace . Paul was startled from his chair . They heard Mary 's light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped and she said , " Oh , God . " They heard it again , as Paul left the room ; Louise 's voice in a sharp wail . " Is it like this all the time around her ? " Constance asked sarcastically . She and Edgar had a certain way of speaking together , of saying things with cold humor that they would never have shown anybody else . They liked to play this humor over serious and forbidding things . Edgar shrugged . " Stick around , " he said . " Anything can happen . Admission free . " Mary came running downstairs . She passed the open door . Constance yelled , " Is this it , Mary ? " " This is it . " Mary was in too much of a hurry to pause long . There was a cold light in her eyes . She shut the door and left the twins staring at each other across the table . They heard her hurrying upstairs again . Paul shot Mary a despairing glance as she entered the bedroom . He was bending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he made such a gesture Mary saw that it was a deliberate effort . Six months of living in the house with Paul and Louise had opened her eyes wide , too wide . Paul had indeed learned in the years since his marriage to obliterate every visible sign of his feeling for Mary , but in the process he had also buried many of his other demonstrative impulses . Only towards Dickie did he act like his old warm , open-hearted self . But only a man of stone would have been unmoved now by the pitiful spectacle of Louise in travail and panic . " Is it bad , Lou ? " She nodded , her brown eyes strained more in fear than in pain . Together Mary and Paul held her hands and tried to communicate to her strength and calmness . " Everything will be all right , " Mary said soothingly . " Would n't you be more comfortable to get your clothes off , and let me help you ? Paul is going to send for the doctor . " " No . " Louise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not going away , Lou . I 'm only running downstairs to send Jones for Mrs. Hibben and Doctor McClintock . I wo n't be a minute . Mary 'll be right here with you . " Louise 's stringy hands went to the small of her back , with a wail . " There it is ! " " I know , " Mary murmured , helping her undress . " I know all about it . ow if you 'll just step  --  that 's it . " She kept up a quiet flow of talk , in athing monotone , while she hung up Louise 's clothes , braided her brown air , and seemingly without purpose , kept her moving slowly about the nom . Louise clutched at the bedpost as they walked across the floor , and himpered , " I want to go to bed . I want Paul . " " He 's coming right back , dear . Right away . I would n't lie down yet , u know . It 's better this way . Easier . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Around and around , slowly and more slowly , she walked in step withp268Louise . The pains were actually slight still , and spaced far apart , but Louise was shuddering and moaning , flinging herself headlong towards panic . " Just be calm , dear , " Mary said quietly . " Take it easy . " She stood holding Louise 's hands in a rigid clasp as the trembling woman bent over , biting her lips , to meet another pain . " That 's better . See , it wo n't be so bad . " Paul came in then , and took Mary 's place beside Louise . " Jones will have Mrs. Hibben here in a few minutes , " he said gently , " and Doctor McClintock is on his way . " " I do n't want Mrs. Hibben , " Louise wailed . " Oh , yes , you do . You like her . " He spoke as he would to Dickie . Louise was crouching by her bed , trying to get into it . " Bed , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She clung to Mary , clawing her arms . Even after Mrs. Hibben , the nurse , arrived , changed into her uniform , and took Louise in hand , the frightened patient would not let Mary go . Mrs. Hibben appeared to be painfully associated in Louise 's mind with the experience of Dickie 's birth and she would not be left alone with her . " No , " she screamed , as Mary moved towards the door . " No , no , no . Come back here . Paul , do n't let her go . " Standing there , awkward and baffled , with Louise 's hand in his , Paul made signs at Mary . " She 'll be right back , Lou , " he said . " She 'll stay with you . She 's just going to see about things downstairs . She has lots to do . " Louise ignored him . " Come back , " she wailed . " Mary , come back . Ouw  --  ouw  --  " Paul glanced meaningly at the nurse , murmuring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Hibben shook her head impatiently . " Of course not . She 'd be much better if everybody left her alone with me until  --  " " Paul ! " cried Louise . " What 's she saying to you ? I wo n't be alone . Stay here , Paul . You and Mary . I do n't want that nurse . You and Mary , Paul . " He sighed desperately . If this first half hour was a sample , Louise was going to give them the worst night of their lives . Her eyes kept rolling wildly in her head , one minute turning to Paul with hysterical pleading , the next flashing panic and temper as they roved the corners of the room . " Where 's Mary ? " she cried . " I want Mary . " " She 's coming right back , Mrs. Scott . " Mrs. Hibben spoke brusquely . " I do wish you 'd try to be more quiet . All this noise wo n't help you at all . Here comes Doctor McClintock now . See if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a welcome escape while the doctor was examining Louise . He ran downstairs to the back parlor . Constance was very pale . The twins were sitting close together now , side by side on the horsehair sofa , their green eyes round with apprehension . " Why is she screaming like that ? " Constance asked , twisting her whitefingers together . " What are they doing to her ? God , this is too ghastly . " " She 's all right , " Paul sighed . He fetched a decanter of brandy fromp269the dining-room and poured himself a drink . Constance grabbed one too . She just carries . on like that , " Paul said . " She 's frightened . " " But what the hell of ? " Constance blurted . " Any ass can have a baby . Ca n't you shut her up ? " Edgar gave her a reproachful look . Constance said , after another wail from upstairs , " It 's a damned outrage . " She fiddled with her rings . " With children in the house . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want her to hear that . " Paul finished his drink and stood up . Constance stared at him incredulously . " Are you going back upstairs ? Back to her ? " Paul made a gesture . " You hear her . " Louise was calling and crying for Paul . They heard her door open and ( - lose , and the doctor coming downstairs . Paul found him in the front hall talking in whispers with Mary . She was saying , " Are you sure , doctor ? Have you told her ? " " What ? " asked Paul . " Come in here . " Doctor McClintock led them into the dining-room and closed the door . " Louise is going to have twins . " Paul sat down heavily in the nearest chair . " How  --  are you sure ? " " I have suspected it for a long time . I thought it wiser not to say anything  --  she'stoo hysterical . You had better be prepared , though . " Paul 's face was pale and his forehead beaded . He stared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Paul please  --  " They shrank as she opened the dining-room door and Louise 's shrill wails echoed down the stairs . Paul found her tossing and heaving , flinging herself about the bed , alternately screaming and moaning . First she clung to his hands and Mrs. Hibben 's , then flung them wildly aside , clawing the sheets and thrashing the air . When Mary came in presently , with her mouth set in tight lines , the too tried to quiet Louise . They all exhorted and pleaded with her . " You must help . You must save your strength . " " Try , Mrs. Scott . Wo n't you please try to help us ? Hold on here . " " No ! " shrieked Louise . " NO , no ! " Her mouth hung open ; her facewas streaming with tears , sweat , and saliva . " Daddy ! " she screamed suddenly . " Da-a-a-ddy ! Daddy Dick ! " Mary looked , startled , at Paul . " What does she mean ? " " I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her father if she 's frightened . " " Mrs. Scott , wo n't you please try . Please be quiet . " Mrs. Hibben 's voice was edged . " Please , Lou , be a good girl . It 'll be so much easier , " Paul leaned over her , pleading and encouraging . She only wailed louder , thrashing from one side of the bed to the other . " No , no , no , no "  --  her voice rose and fell in crazy cadences . " I want Daddy . I want Paul . Paul . Daddy , pain . Pain  --  " " I 'm right here , Lou . Here I am. "  |p270The  doctor came in and stood looking sternly at the spectacle . " Louise , " he said in a sudden , sharp tone , " you must control yourself . " Her jaw sagged lower ; she fixed her rolling eyes on him ; then shedrew a breath and screeched louder than ever . It was not nearly so many hours as it seemed ; it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened Louise 's door after a trip down to the kitchen for boiling water , and then stood trying to rally her nerve before going into that room again . Mary 's face was dead white , haggard and harrowed . Her hair was hidden under a tightly-wrapped towel . When she stepped into the room she saw to her intense relief that Louise 's tossing and flailing and thrashing had stopped . Mrs. Hibben and Paul had her pinioned across hed bed , and the doctor was working over the birth which had begun . Louise 's eyes , which had rolled insanely and unresponsively to all their entreaties for her help , were laxly closed ; her screams had subsidedto throbbing groans ; and the room smelled of chloroform . Mary was surprised . She had not expected that of Doctor McClintock , who had sternly and repeatedly dismissed Paul 's suggestions and Louise 's shrieks for " something . " Mary looked pityingly at Paul . He was tense and gray-faced , his eyes like two stones . A heavy scowl indented his forehead . He and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collars and cuffs , and had rolled up their white shirt-sleeves to their elbows . It was a weird sight . In all the crowded , tumultuous mass of her shared experience with Paul there was nothing to make this scene seem real . It could not be that she and he were struggling together to help his child into the world  --  his children , she thought with a start , and passed the back of her hand shakily across her eyes . Exhaustion or the creeping fumes of chloroform  --  she did not know  --  were blurring the whole fantastic sight before her . Louise 's body contracted convulsively , a horrible sound parted her lips . Mary 's grasp tightened on the damp shoulder beneath her fingers . The doctor straightened up , holding a greasy scarlet thing with wormlike limbs . Mrs. Hibben put her hand on Louise 's sheeted belly as Doctor McClintock shook and smacked the infant . Mary and Paul looked on in horror , holding Louise between them . There was a strange , hideous interval , with the doctor and the nurse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unbelievablyhappening all over again ; with eight hands holding and manipulatingthe prostrate , unhuman , bleeding thing on the bed , and all of this fantastically unrelated to Paul . He stood there stony and shocked and clay-colored , doing what he was told . Mary did not remember afterwards the long business of helping Mrs. Hibben with the two feebly squirming infants , the horrible , exhausting cleaning up , the tottering from that awful room to Clarissa Scott 's quiet empty one down the hall and sinking into the rocker by the window . The dawn was beginning to lighten the sky and far in the distance there was the red glow , too , of furnaces blowing down by the river . She sat and pressed her forehead to the cool glass of the window . Paul came in and she looked up . He walked across the floor like a jointed wooden effigy , pausing to stare dully at his mother 's empty bed . His mouthp271moved ; he said " Mama , " in a tragic way . Then he walked over to Mary and dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lap . " Mary , " he said , in a strangled croak . " Oh , Mary . I have three sons . " CONSTANCE STAYED ON for a month . She had come from England without definite plans , never supposing that her mother 's illness would terminate so suddenly . After it was over she made rather indifferent inquiriesabout the next sailings to England . And then , when Mary urged her not to hurry back , she concurred , really to her own surprise . The life in Pittsburgh was so profoundly different from her own tense , brilliant existence in London that once having made the adjustment it was wonderfullyrelaxing to let herself sink into the old ways . Now that she was participating from choice instead of necessity , it was consoling to find life the same ; the calm and order of the house broken only by the shouts of Dickie and Clarrie at play ; the homely routine of Mary 's housekeeping , with its scrupulous supervision of dusting and cleaning and paint washing , ; . the delicious simple meals , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delicacies , rich entrees , and splendid wines . She even fell back into her childhood habit of walking to market with Mary , wandering about among the stalls of the big glass-roofed shed , feasting her eyes and her watering mouth on the tubs of fresh country butter , the crocks of soft pot-cheese , the plump chickens and waxy ducks and blackleggedturkeys ; the home-made sausages and scrapple and the smokeblackenedhams and bacon ; the heaped baskets of eggs , the fragrant hearthbakedbread which the farm wives brought to market . It was a dream more believable , somehow , than the gilded , flunkeyed halls of palaces , realer than the card-rooms of great and famous houses . Dinner every night in the dark , oak-panelled dining-room , with her two brothers and an occasionalold friend of Paul 's ( Louise was still recuperating in her bedroom ) , with the solemn , capable Trude walking sturdily around the table , was almost an adventure because of its sheer contrast with all the dinners of the past nine years , and all the people with whom she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner . Anybody who did , except for a dinner-party , would have been considered a freak in Allegheny . After dinner Constance loved to join the boys in a glass of port , and smoke her small Turkish cigarettes while Edgar pulled at his stogy and Paul enjoyed his pipe . Paul had never seen a woman smoke before the first evening when Constance produced her jewelled cigarette-case ; and if Edgar had , he was discreet enough not to remark it . Constance put her brothers completely at ease . It was clear from every word she spoke , from all her actions , her decisions , and her tastes that she was accustomed far more to the companionship of men than of women . Most masculine of all her characteristics , and most surprising in such a beautiful and feminine woman was her close-mouthed avoidance of talk about the people , especiallycertain exalted people , with whom she spent her time in England . She was entirely matter-of-fact about the jewels , the sables , the luxurious appurtenances and the superb Paris clothes which both her brothers knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Constance 's own substantial income . She seldom mentioned Giles . If questioned about him , she shrugged . She admitted privately to Edgar that she scarcely ever saw him . " But I have to have a name , do n't I ? " she said , blowing smoke through her nose . " And an address . " She also told Edgar the dreary tale of Giles 's family , changed now only by the death two years before of Tyrringdale , the heir . " So you 'll be a Countess some day , " Edgar said . " I hope you like it . " " Countess of Mortgages , as far as I can see , " Constance said . " The title 's a joke , you know . There 's not only no money , there are such debts that the little remaining family property will have to be liquidated to pay them . But I do n't care . I 'll make out . " " I bet you will . " Edgar 's tone suggested that he meant more than he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him . He had changed so much in the past few years . He was more reserved , more mysteriousthan anyone she knew . And it was totally foreign to his nature to be so . She knew him , she felt , as thoroughly as she knew herself . She could feel in her own mind and emotions the identical thoughts and feelings that she read in him ; all except for this new baffling curtain of mystery behind which he withdrew oftener and oftener . She spoke at great length to Mary about it . She loved to spend the late afternoon at tea in Mary 's sittingroom , curled up in one of the armchairs by the gas fire while Mary sat opposite with her sewing . One dark December day , with the blinds drawn against the impenetrablesmog outside , Constance was sitting there , licking jam from the tea sandwiches off her fingertips and reaching for her cigarettes , when Mary said , " Have you spoken to Edgar again about going back with you ? " " I tried . He wo n't do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It seems queerer and queerer . After all , he has no reason to act this way . Gloomy and mysterious . " " How do you know ? You ca n't tell me he has no reason . Personally , I believe Ed 's in a hellish mess of some kind and does n't know how to get himself out . He 'd tell me about it if he 'd speak to anybody alive  --  but he wo n't . Something 's driving him mad , Mary . He 's in a shocking state . " Mary sewed quietly for a time . She was , Constance saw , thinking somethingover , weighing whether or not to tell Constance what was on her mind . Then she looked up and laid her work in her lap and said , " I used to wonder what he does all the time . Since he 's stopped going out  --  runningaround  --  the way he used to  --  " " He has , now you mention it , " Constance said . " He 's always here in the evenings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p273Mary  shook her head . " It 's a long time , " she said slowly , " since Edgar has done the things he used to do . " " I 'll be damned , " Constance murmured , narrowing her eyes . Suddenly she sat up and asked sharply , " What does he do ? When I 'm not here ? " Mary hesitated . " He  --  " she bit off a thread . " Mostly he stays in his room . And reads , I think . " " Well , he always read a lot . That 's not extraordinary . Unless  --  unless it 's all he does . Is that what you mean ? " She leaned forward and lighted another cigarette . " What does he read ? " " Philosophy , " Mary said slowly . " Oh , those old Greeks and things . He always poked about in those . " " Religious philosophy , I think , " Mary said . " Certain kinds . " Constance blew smoke from her nose and asked in a shrewd way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a feeling you 're being devious . " " No . But I  --  do wish I understood this thing about Edgar . " Mary drew a long breath and said , as if anxious to get it off her chest , " One day quite a while ago  --  quite soon after I came back here  --  I found Eddie in this room looking through those books . " She indicated a small shelf above her desk , where Constance saw a row of black leather-bound books . Constance stared in a puzzled way . " Why  --  those are your prayer books , " she said . " Catholic books . " " That 's just it . I  --  oh , you know how you pass off a queer thing like that . I pretended not to notice what he was looking at , but I was awfully surprised . He made some remark and went away . But since then he 's kept un doing that and lately  --  " " Yes ? " Constance was tense now . " Lately he 's been borrowing those books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And "  --  Mary colored unexpectedly  --  " asking me questions . " " Questions , " Constance repeated , as if there could be no question to which Edgar would not know the answer better than Mary . " About  --  certain things in our faith . He calls it , " Mary said , " Catholic philosophy . The philosophy of penance . " She swallowed . " It 's terribly unnatural , Constance , " she said in a panicky way . " Terribly . That 's why  --  I wish you 'd take him back to London and get him out of himself . He 's  --  " Constance was shaking her red curls slowly . " I smell , " she said , " a great big rat . A monster of a rat . Look here . " She leaned forward and stared compellingly into Mary 's eyes . " Do you know what 's the matter with him ? Honest to God  --  do you ? " Mary did not answer . Constance insisted , " What do you think it is ? What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Mary looked up with an effort . " Yes , " she said stiffly . Then she turned her head away . " You think you know who ? " Constance was driving at her now . For a time Mary did not answer . Then she looked up and thought for u minute and said , " Maybe . I do n't really know . " She was very troubled and uncomfortable . " If I followed my suspicions I 'm so afraid I 'd dis- cover something  --  " she choked  --  " something I do n't want to know . " Her voice dropped to a whisper . " What do you mean ? " Mary whipped hard at a buttonhole . Her lips were pinched tight . " I 'm not going to talk about it any more , " she said . Constance leaned back in the chair , shook her head , and stared at the ceiling . " This place seems full of things like that , " she said slowly . " Edgar 's a nervous wreck . And I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary kept her eyes lowered . She had always dreaded any mention that Constance might make of Paul . Yet if she headed her off , she might only arouse livelier speculation . " I think Paul 's happier than he 's ever been , " she said , making her tone as stout as she could . Constance laughed hollowly . " Then he 's been a very , very unhappy man . He never seems alive to me . Here I 've been dining and talking all evening with those two chaps every day for nearly a month . And what do you think they talk about ? The steel business . " " Well , my goodness , Constance , what would you expect them to talk about ? What else have they got to talk about ? " " Do n't ask me . I have n't seen ' em for years . But whether I know my own brothers is not so much to the point as how well I know men . And those two are not acting like men who 're getting what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from something . " Constance leaned forward and emphasized her words by a jerk of her chin . " Running to beat hell . " Mary sighed at Constance 's language . " Look here , " she said . She laid down her sewing and stared at Constance . " Paul married Louise for a home and children and he took plenty of time making up his mind to do it . He 's got what he wanted , you must see that . " " See it ? You 're the home and the mother of the children , and you know it damned well . " Constance watched Mary turn pale at her words and went on speaking roughly . " This place was no home when Louise was supposed to be making it one . I did n't even need to ask Ed to find that out . And for all she means to her children she might as well be a cockatoo . " Constance grimaced . " The trouble with Paul is he 's legally married to Louise and he 's  --  " she paused . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mary . Did you think I did n't know ? " There was a dead silence . The small clock on the desk ticked grotesquelyloud , though a moment before one would not have noticed it . Constance scowled , instantly regretful for the pain she saw she had caused . Mary raised her head presently . Her face was chalky , her lips gray . " Oh , Constance , " she said . Another woman might have rushed to Mary , thrown her arms about her , and through affection and sympathy reduced both of them to hysteria . Constance merely jabbed a hairpin in and out of her chignon of red curls and swore half aloud , " God , I 'm sorry , " she muttered . " I 'm an ass . A beast . Forgive me. "  | " There 's nothing to forgive , " Mary whispered . Then Constance sat up straight . " Yes there is , " she said . " You 've had the dirtiest deal of any woman on earth . Why you 've been  --  crucified by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand what you 're doing . " " I get along very well . I know what I 'm doing . " " Then open your eyes a little wider and know still more . You do n't think Paul is going to stand this fantastic arrangement forever , do you ? My God , it 's like something out of a Greek tragedy . You two are laying up dynamite for yourselves . " " Constance , you dramatize things so . You live in a world of pure excitement and you think of everybody 's life in that light . " " No , I do n't . You 're mistaken . It 's true I like excitement , I always did . I know what makes people want excitement , I know what goes on underneath , I know men , Mary  --  I ought to . " Mary colored , and Constance went on talking . " I 'm trying to tell you that sooner or later this unnatural situation is going to overwhelm Paul and the whole bloody thing will come down on your heads like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as time goes on , you know . She 's going to get craftier and crazier every day she lives . " Mary lifted her head slowly , her mouth opening in a bewildered way . " Crazier ? " she breathed . Constance shrugged . " Oh , I do n't mean she 's a raving lunatic . I 'm not trying to bring Jane Eyre up to date . But certainly you do n't think Louise is a perfectly normal woman ? You 're too smart to be as innocent as that . Why , if she were normal , Mary , she 'd get up on her feet and throw you out . " " I  --  never thought of it that way . " " It 's true . It 's got to be true . And it 's also true that Louise senses , whether she actually knows or not , exactly how Paul feels about her and about you . He 'll do his duty towards her as long as he can stand it . He 'll be willing to do it as long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if she kicked you out he 'd go all to pieces  --  and take it out on her . She knows that . Do n't fool yourself . " Mary sat quiet , biting her lower lip . At last she said , " I 'm appalled . There 's no use pretending every word you say is n't true . It is  --  horribly true . I 'm so confused  --  oh , so tangled up . " She pressed her forehead with her fingertips , shaking her head slowly . " It 's not even possible to see what to do . I ought to go away , and yet  --  " " If you did , you 'd bring down Paul 's whole life around his ears . He 's walking a tightrope already . He 's pouring most of his heart and soul into that mill . Let him go on doing it . Strangely enough , your being here is a kind of anaesthetic  --  some sort of buffer between him and Louise . But it 's not going to stay that way , Mary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know what I ought to do , " Mary repeated slowly . " I 'll tell you what you ought to do . " Constance leaned forward , her elbows on her knees and her face strained and serious . " This is n't easy to say , Mary . It wo n't be easy for you to listen to . " " Then do n't say it . " Mary 's tone was glassy.  | " All right , I wo n't , in so many words . You 're too smart anyhow . But one of these days Paul is going to need  --  everything  --  from you  --  and if you 're wise you 'll see he gets it . " Mary shuddered . " Have you no more decency than you ever had ? " " No more prudery , is what you really mean . I 'm giving you the best advice I 've got , Mary , and my advice about a thing like that is worth taking . Besides , what have you got to lose ? What else have you got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reluctantly . " Then your job is to keep Paul going . By any means the job requires . If you let him down he 'll mess up his life even worse than he has already , and Louise 's too , not to mention the boys . Somewhere , somehow , he 's got to be free  --  " " There 's the mill . " " Certainly . He pours himself into that . But if you think a row of furnacesand rivers of molten steel are all the satisfaction a man needs  --  oh , hell , I 'd better not talk any more . I 'm sorry I butted in . But you know how I feel . You and Ed and Paul are the only people in the whole United States I care a damn about , and it 's frightful to see you all crucifying yourselves . " Constance was cut off then by Clarrie coming in to say good night to her mother . The little girl was freshly bathed , and her blonde curls lay damp around her shoulders . She perched on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Would you like a cookie , darling ? " " Nannie would not like it , " Clarrie said primly . " Well , you may have half a one . " Constance broke a wafer in two . " The half you eat is for me and the part you do n't eat is for Nannie . " " You 'll give that child a set of morals as twisted as your own , " Mary said shortly . " Rot . One thing she wo n't be is a hypocrite . " " When are we going home ? " Clarrie asked . " Very soon , now . Do you want to ? " Clarrie thought the matter over . " I like it here , " she said , " but I think I prefer London , Mummie . " " London it is , " Constance said . " I prefer it myself . " She kissed her child good night and sent her upstairs to Nannie . The two women sat on silently by the fire . Trude appeared presently at the door holding an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the appearance of any telegram ; but this was a cable . It said so on the envelope . Constance took it and ripped it open carelessly . " Well , well , " she said . She flung the paper over into Mary 's lap . " So it 's come . " FATHER DIED THIS AFTERNOON SOLICITORS REQUEST YOUR RETURNFOR ESTATE REASONS CABLE SAILING GILESp277Constance sat still , staring at the blue gas flames . " So now I 'm the Countess of Melling , " she said in a sarcastic voice , " and my lawfully wedded hindrance is a belted Earl . Without a shilling to jingle in his pocket . What a pretty picture ! " " You always said you wanted a title . " " So I did . Well , you never hear me grousing , do you ? But I 'll be sorry to leave you . And I wish I could make Ed listen to reason . " IN HER SITTING-ROOM next to the back parlor Mary had settled down , after Trude took away her dinner tray , to write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual Sunday afternoon quiet . Paul was in the back parlor , taking a nap . This had been his father 's habit , like so many others into which Paul had grown . Paul had the Sunday papers and his favorite pipe and the mill worksheets for the coming week , and the householdaccount books which Mary left every Saturday night on his desk . Best of all he had his father 's horsehair sofa , sagged in the middle from the Old Man 's weight . Paul had never wanted it rebuilt . He liked to stretch out here and digest his dinner , smoke his pipe , read  --  for a while  --  the Sunday Gazette , and presently , drop into a snooze . He had a guilty sensation about that . He felt that , at barely thirty-seven , he had no right to form such a lazy old man 's habit . He kept the blinds drawn and the door closed during his Sunday afternoon nap , fatuously hoping that nobody in the house knew what he was doing . He always said he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now two , were having their naps also , and Louise was upstairslying down . There was not a sound to be heard except the light scratching of Mary 's pen . It had been quiet in the house for so long that Mary did not consciously hear the door of the adjoining room open and shut ; she only realized that it had . She did not notice when she first heard the rise and fall of Edgar 's voice in conversation with Paul . It was only when she heard Edgar say , with a note of high tension , " I 've got to do it , Paul . I 've got to , " that she laid down her pen with the sinking sensation that she was about to overhear something she was not intended to know . She rose lightly and went to the hall door , meaning to go away upstairs at once . And then she heard Paul say , " You ca n't mean that , Ed . You ca n't spring such a thing on me . " Mary 's hands turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant to go upstairs , to get quickly away from the chance to overhear another word . And yet she stood stockstill . This shocking moment of eavesdrop- ping held the key to the mystery of Edgar 's secret torment . Though , as she had said to Constance , she feared to know the truth , she gave in to a swift , final determination to learn it at last . She moved quietly to a chair by the wall and sat down. "  --  ought to have done it long ago . " " But Ed . If I had no other right to know , I 'm your brother . And your employer . I ca n't let you junk your whole life without even asking why . " " It 's my life , is n't it ? " " Yes , but you must be  --  why Ed , you 've got everything to live for . And look forward to . Lots of money . A fine job . Freedom . " There was a bitter ring in Paul 's tone . " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You have no burdens . No ties . My God , if I were in your place  --  " Mary 's heart beat hard . " If you were in my place , " Edgar 's voice rose almost to a screech , " you 'd be wishing you were dead  --  like me ! " " Why , Ed . " There was a thud as Mary knew that Paul had swung himself from the sofa and gone to stand close to his brother . Mary could picture Paul 's arm around Edgar 's shoulders , and the horrified bewildermentin Paul 's grave face . She twisted her hands miserably . The voices dropped and became an unintelligible murmur for a while . Mary rose to her feet and walked nervously and soundlessly around the carpeted room . And then she heard the question that told her the thing she had dreaded for ten years to face , the thing she could not say she knew . Paul asked , " Does Mary know ? " She opened the connecting door between the rooms and walked in on the brothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apart . Both stood staring as Mary crossed the room and came close to them . Paul 's mouth was open ; he was breathing hard . He had clearly had a great shock . Edgar bit his lips . His eyes were dilated and fixed almost in horror on Mary . His forehead was damp with sweat . " Oh , " he said thickly . " Yes , " Mary said in a flat way , " I know . It is Bridget , is n't it , Edgar ? " Paul made a sound like a groan . Edgar only stood there , nodding dumbly . " Did you  --  hear  --  in there ? " " Yes . But I knew anyway . " Paul said , " How ? " " How do we know all such things ? How have we always known  --  " she looked at Paul and spoke as if Edgar were not there  --  " the things we know ? " Edgar opened his mouth and tried to speak . But he only made a choked sound and buried his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's not a question of forgiving , " she said . " If I could blame Edgar I would . I ca n't even be sure , " she said bitterly , " that he was the man . But what I want to know is  --  where is Bridget ? Some things nobody can stand . " Edgar groped for her hand . Paul put an arm around each of them and led them over to the sofa.  | " We 'd better have it all out . For God 's sake , let 's get to the bottom of  --  everything . " " Where is Bridget ? " Mary repeated . " That you can tell me , Edgar . " He leaned towards her , pale and shaken . " I do n't know , " he said . " That 's just the trouble . I 've never seen her , you know  --  not since  --  since  --  " " Since before  --  when  --  she  --  " Edgar nodded again . " Then what  --  what has happened now ? What did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to leave here , " Edgar said . " I 'm leaving the mill  --  and all of you  --  all of it  --  everything  --  " Paul looked strickenly at Mary over Edgar 's head . He was trying to see what she knew that would explain this shock from Edgar . Mary moved her hands in a strange , futile gesture . Edgar looked up presently and said , " Why do n't you two start in on me ? I know what you 're thinking . I deserve it . " Paul said , " You do , in a way . But what 's the good of that , Ed ? We ca n't give you any hell that you have n't been through by yourself , for years . " " You 're being very fair . Once there was a time when I used to defy my conscience by telling myself I was no worse than you  --  and Mary  --  " He gulped . " You see what people really know in spite of everything . " Paul looked at Mary again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I was n't in love . " He coveredhis face with his hands . " I was just  --  you know . " " This is n't getting us anywhere , " Mary said sharply . " What 's done is done . But I want to know the whole story . I want to know what 's become of my sister . " Paul spoke quietly . " Do you want to tell us everything you know , Ed ? " " I do n't know much . That 's always been the chief trouble . But I 'll tell you what I can . I make no bones about it , understand . It 's a rotten story . " " Do you think we 've been blind all these years ? " Edgar rose from the sofa and began to walk back and forth across the room . Paul and Mary sat still ; painfully still . " I picked up a girl in West Park one evening in June in my sophomore year in college , " Edgar said . " She was pretty and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very hard on you . " " It always was , " Mary said quietly . " Well , I 'm not trying to excuse myself , understand . I was out to raise hell and I was n't interested in anything but the excitement . Anyway , the girl was in the same boat . I do n't know , Mary , whether it was true that I was  --  " he stopped . " That she was a good girl until then ? That 's what she told you ? " Paul asked . Edgar nodded . " But she took the whole thing in her stride . She expected it . She knew what  --  what she was doing . "  | " Of course she did , " Mary said impatiently . " That 's not what I 'm trying to find out . What happened ? " " I took her , " Edgar said in painful reluctance , " over to Herron Hill . I was going there anyway . " Mary pressed her lips together . " Did you know who she was ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something about her seemed familiar in a strange way but I swear to God I had no notion who she was . By that time she had got in with the  --  woman at the place on the Hill and she was  --  well , she liked it , that 's all . When I did find out who she was I was scared to death and I tried every way I could think of to get her to stop . But she would n't . She laughed at me . I did n't want to  --  to have anything more to do with her after that . I was too frightened . Anyway , " Edgar said , struggling with his mortification , " she told me she was through with me . She said she did n't want any college boy wasting her time . " " Ah , Holy Mother . " Edgar hurried on . He was anxious to have it all over with now . " I never went near that place again . I never saw her again . I worked in the mill all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Jim 's department , and I was so upset about the whole thing it used to make me sick to see him . Then I went back to college in the fall and after a while I  --  well , I pretty much forgot about it . " Edgar paused in his pacing and rested his elbow on the mantel . Paul and Mary had not glanced at each other . She was staring at the windows , Paul at the floor . Presently Mary said , " What about the child she had , Edgar ? You know my father threw her out of the house the followingwinter . " Edgar sighed heavily . " I knew she had a child , of course , Mary . That was the beginning of my realizing what a terrible thing I 'd done . I tell you , I did n't especially care about  --  about  --  what I did to the girl . She was , " Edgar 's narrow face was dead white with the strain of the relentless truth he had decided to tell , " that kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mary said . " My brother and everybody else knew it . " " It was you , " Edgar said quietly . " And the thought of the child . I did n't know what you meant to me until I saw it all that way . Every time I looked at you , " Edgar said , his throat closing up on the words , " I thought about what I 'd done . Every time you did some tremendous unselfish thing for one of us I 'd think what I 'd done to that sister of yours  --  to you , I mean , really  --  and , " he looked up and there was no mistaking the awful set of his face  --  " I 've reached the end of my rope . " " But  --  but why go away ? " Mary whispered . " Leave Paul , and the mill , . and all ? " " I have to be the judge of that , " Edgar said . " Every time I 've looked at you all these years I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer I 've held it in the worse it 's been . Mary , " he said seizing her hand in a wild way , " you 're the living personification of everything saintly and good . And I 've  --  "  |p281She  burst into tears and buried her face in her hands . " But I 'm not , " she sobbed . " I 'm no different  --  from  --  you  --  from anybody  --  Holy Mother , we 're all alike  --  " Paul nodded solemnly as Edgar watched him . " If you 'd only come to us years ago , Kid , " he said hoarsely . " If we 'd only all  --  well , pooled our - our  --  " " How could I ? " Edgar asked desperately . " That year when Mary came home from Con 's ? Do you remember the state you were in that spring ? How you felt about Mary ? There was all that horrible thing about Father and Jim . That made it much worse . But Mary 's coming home  --  to  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgiveness for reopeningthe old wounds now  --  " to marry you . My- God , " he groaned , " I almost killed myself that night she came back here . " " Poor Ed , " Mary said , wiping her eyes . She stroked the thinning blond hair from his high forehead . " Poor little spalpeen . " She remembered his strange cold behavior when he came in that evening and found her with his parents and Paul in the dining-room . " It 's grown worse every year , " he said . " When you start to hide a thing like that the deception grows on you and grows , and the fear and the worry and the guilt  --  " his voice rose wildly again . Mary and Paul sat tense and horrified . Edgar turned and buried his head in his arms against the mantel . Mary of up and went over and put her arms around him . He clutched her shoulerwith one hand . Paul sat on the couch , shaking his head . It was a orrible story ; a thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man , and of his self-respect and his hope for a life of any kind t all . Paul waited a long time and then asked , " Have you ever tried to nd out anything about the girl ? Have you ever made any investigation t all ? " " Such as I could . The only thing I ever did get was proof that Bridget Rafferty did have a child in the house of a certain woman in Watt Street . e identified Bridget from a picture . The child was born in March , 1883 well , it could have been as they claimed on Herron Hill  --  that 's " What else did you find out from the woman in Watt Street ? " Mary ed . Paul knew that she would be there herself the next morning . " Did e know anything  --  about  --  them ? " " The child was a girl , " Edgar said in a muffled tone , staring at the ir . " She said they stayed in the house a week . A man paid the lodging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a cab . Bridget used other name and the woman did n't care who she was anyway . It was At kind of a place . " " And you have never had any proof since that she and the child are alive , or even "  --  Paul gasped as the thought struck him fully  --  " that the child was yours ? Why it 's incredible . " Paul leaned forward , wrinkling his head . " It was  --  well , I do n't mean to be cruel , but it was unnecessary , . You should have told me about it . " it " I should ? When ? When you had just married Louise ? When Mama got sick ? When Mary came back here to live ? When Mama died ? How could I , Paul ? By the time you had a child of your own and Mary was here again I  --  I  --  used to  --  oh , it 's been torment . All the time . " He dropped suddenly into a chair and passed his shaking hand across his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finally Paul said , " Would there be any use in my trying to trace that child ? Would that help at all ? You 're willing for me to do that , are n't you ? " " I 'm willing for you to do anything you can or will do , if only I never have to hear of this thing again . I 've reached the end of my rope , Paul . I want to go away . " " Of course . I see now . You must go away . Take the next boat and go over and pay a long visit to Con . Stay as long as you like . " " I 'm not sure that 's what I want . I think I 'd rather go some place absolutely quiet  --  and stay a long , long time . " Edgar 's eyes sought Mary 's in a searching look . " I 'm  --  I 've got interested in something different . I want to go away and study . " " Study what ? " Paul looked from his brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extraordinary secret understanding . " Do you know what he means , Mary ? " She could not say that she did . And yet the intensity of Edgar 's tone , the meaning he had put into that long , earnest glance stirred her strangely . She sat looking at Edgar with the feeling that she really could understand by instinct what he seemed to expect her to know . Some of his questions about sin , about confession and penance and the doctrines of her religion stood out with a new and tragic meaning now . She smiled tenderly at Edgar . " He does need a long rest , and a complete change , " she said to Paul . " You want to be quite free for an indefinite time , do n't you , Edgar ? " He nodded thoughtfully . " I would n't want to promise when I 'd come back . Oh , and I do n't want any money , Paul . Just take over everything I 've got and settle something on  --  on her  --  them  --  if you ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live on . Only a very little . " " But I do n't understand . " Paul rose and went over to Edgar and stood staring at him . " What about the mill ? What do you mean  --  an indefinite time ? No money ? This is supposed to be a vacation . " Edgar did not answer . Mary put her hand on Paul 's sleeve . She kept her eyes on Edgar . His pale , sad face was gray-white . His high forehead , the droop of his shoulders , were curiously eloquent . " Do n't ask him to explain any more now , Paul . You 'll make it possible for him to do what he wants , wo n't you ? " " I could n't stop him even if I wanted to . Of course he can go . But I need you here in the mill , Ed . Surely you realize that . " Edgar nodded gently . " I do . But do n't hold me to a promise about it , Paul . First I 've got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You 've both been magnificent about this . Far , far finer and more generous and understanding than I deserve . Both of you . " Suddenly he put his face into his hands and sobbed.  |p283I  T WAS A BAD DAY in the mill . There had been too many such days in the past six months ; too much tension , too many mistakes , too much anxiety and work for Paul . Edgar 's departure had left him in critical need of a supervisor for the finishing departments . For years Paul and Edgar had divided the general superintendent 's work between them . Paul had had charge of all the furnaces , in addition to the general management and his own metallurgical work in the laboratory . Edgar had been responsible for the finishing departments  --  the blooming and bar mills , and the hammer shop . Without him Paul was badly handicapped . There was trouble of some kind in the blooming mill this afternoon , and on the way down there Paul was thinking of the awful confusion that followed his father 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . There had been a bad atmosphere in town for a long time , too . The men had been restless and sullen during the six months of the strike out at Homestead . There had been repercussions in every other shop in the district . If it had not been for his contract with the Amalgamated , Paul knew that his mill would have been struck long ago . He had been walking a tightwire f anxiety behind his apparent imperturbability . And with the men he had learned to be taciturn like his father too . He found them starting a run . The roller boss was a hardfaced Irishmannamed Corbley , most of his crew men like himself whom he had recommendedto Edgar . Roller , engineer , tablemen , manipulator , shearman , pit craneman , heater , and helpers , all were skilled men , sure of their jobs and solid behind Corbley . Still , something was wrong in that department . A few laborers were working around there , Hunkies loading scrap ends from the shear table onto cars and shovelling out scale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , heavy work , sometimes dangerous . Nobody paid ny attention to them . They were considered beneath it . Paul stood watching the crew . Something had been wrong yesterday with one of the reversing gears . The millwright had just left the shop . 1'o Paul 's eye the rolls were working all right now , the great salmon-pinkgot shooting back and forth in the reversing-stands , changing shape , ttening , elongating , as the manipulator shifted it lightning-fast from oneof rolls to the next . Corbley came over and stood beside Paul . He hadjust given the order for a second ingot to be hoisted up from the soaking-s to the roll-table . The first was almost ready for the shear table , wherewould be cut into the blooms that went next to the bar mill for finishing. rbley had the hard arrogance of a man in full command of his job . Formoment he had nothing routine to do ; boss rollers started to work harden there was trouble . " Looks all right now , " Paul said in the customary roar that had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Twud n't be a  --  " Corbley said no more . There was trouble.  |p284Accidents  happen too fast even for the most accurate eye to record . Paul could not see every detail , though he was at the roll-table in one huge stride . The gear had jammed again . There were the horrible hoarse screams , the curses , the lightning leaps here and there that repeated the nightmare of every accident . The rougher 's arm had been crushed in the jammed roll as he struggled with his hook to knock the bloom over on to the next table . He was writhing on the floor , the mangled stump of the arm twitching and streaming blood , the men kneeling around him , Corbley trying to stanch the gush of blood . Somebody , Paul thought in a cruelly matter-offactway , while he rushed an oiler out for a doctor , somebody 's bungled this shop for a long time , somebody should have  --  Christ !  --  he thought , stiffening with horror , nobody 's stopped the  --  he looked up , across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roll engineer  --  something was happening up on the pulpit too . There was no time to find out now . Roll engineers should react instantaneously , the machinery should have stopped . Instead a half-rolled bloom of red-hot steel was going wild here  --  Paul turned , then , stupefied with horror , to the unbelievable sight of a Hunky scrap-man standing in the manipulator 's place , calmly turning and shifting the bloom and watching expertly for the second ingot to come down the table . Half the machinery was still working . Paul felt the sweat streaming down his ribs and the insides of his thighs as he clambered onto the pulpit , seized the levers , and stopped all the rolls . The engineer lay at his feet . Not in one accident in ten thousand , shockingly common as they were , would such a thing happen again . The man had had a heart-attack . He was an old , skilled hand . Probably the shock of the ghastly thing down the line , Paul thought . He went back to the roll-table . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was tying off the artery on the stump of the rougher 's arm . The man was gray from loss of blood , unconscious ; mayb dead already , Paul thought , retching . This business of accidents was recurrent crucifixion . He hated it , loathed it , struggled and slaved and fought against it . He had installed every safety device known to the indus . try and a good many unknown , experimental ones ; and still things lik this could happen . He asked wretchedly about the injured man and th doctor shrugged doubtfully and Paul told him about the engineer lyin up on the pulpit . Men rushed off to lift him down . Paul turned away sic and saw the Hunky still standing , stolid and watchful , his hands on t manipulating device . Paul had hardly spoken to a Hunky in all the fiv years since he had begun taking them into the mill . You could n't spe to them ; they spoke no English . There had to be some one man who uncle stood enough English to interpret the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own outlandish lingo . But Paul looked at this Hunk and the Hunky looked back , with glittering dark eyes . " What 's your name ? " Paul asked sharply . " Karel Hrdlicka . " The Hunky 's voice was a throaty growl . Oh God , Paul thought . This is going to be fine . I ca n't understand damn thing he 'll say , even his name . He looked around . Another Hunk pushing a barrow of scale , was looking at them curiously . It was a senp285t ion , a miracle , it would be all over the boardinghouses tonight . The Big Boss was talking to a Hunky . " Boss ask name , " the second Hunky said , pointing at Hrdlicka . " Call him Charlie . " " Charlie ? " Paul repeated slowly . " They call you Charlie around here ? " The Hunky nodded with slow gravity . " Call Charlie Liska . No say real name . " Paul stood looking at the man . He was squat , bulky , and hairy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the long bristling arms , the heavy legs weighting the body low . Charlie wore stained and blackenedpants , a torn black shirt , and a dirty visored cap . Small brown eyes and a tangle of hanging moustache gave him the look of a bull seal . A bitter , acrid odor of sweat and oil and metal , mingled with tobacco and garlic , hung about him . His lips under the bush of his moustache were a startling red . Paul pointed at the cooling bloom lying on the roll-table . " Where did you learn to do that ? " he asked . He spoke as slowly and distinctly as he could . The Hunky 's face was expressionless but his small brown eyes glittered . He said , " By Skoda . " He pronounced it thickly : Shkoda . " Skoda ! Do you mean the Skoda works ? In Austria ? " Paul leaned forward , scowling with amazement . " Yah . " " You mean , " Paul said , gesturing , " you mean you are a skilled manipulatortrained at Skoda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell , " Paul exploded , kicking the heap of sheared scraps the man had been collecting , " are you doing that for ? " Others were watching them now . The injured man and the dead man had been carried out . There would be no more blooms rolled today ; they were going to dismantle the stands to locate the trouble . The IrishAmericancrew stood in a bunch across the table from Paul and the Hunky . They had ugly sets to their mouths ; ominous glints in their eyes . Some of them muttered to one another through their teeth . " Slovaks no get such job , " Charlie said , motioning at the machinery and the scowling crew . " Get laborer . " That was all the explanation Charlie could muster in his English . He was not capable of explaining much . He could not take the trouble to explain that he was not a Slovak at all , but a Czech . Big Boss would never have heard of a Czech . He would just about understand that the flunkies ( not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they themselves never used ) were really Slovaks . . Boss knew well enough , though , that nobody in Pittsburgh would dream of hiring a Hunky for a skilled job . Nobody would dream a Hunky would be able to do one even If he could get it . Paul stood thinking for a minute . His arms were folded across his chest . He was staring thoughtfully at the Hunky . The crew across the table were watching him like hawks . Paul opened his mouth slowly and rubbed his chin and pulled hisp286moustache . Then he said , " Charlie , I 'm going to put you on this job . " Charlie 's face had been twisted with bewilderment and with the strain of this business of talking to the Big Boss . For a minute it did not relax . Paul thought he had not understood . There were growls and threatening sounds and curses from lip to lip among the crew over there . Paul did not care . He had weighed all that in the moment before making his unbelievablestatement to the Hunky . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . He did not care . He was angry . Angry at the bungling somewhere that had kept this department tangled up , angry at the blind stupidity and prejudice that had wasted this superbly skilled workman on common labor . The output of a blooming mill depended on the speed and skill and judgmentof the manipulator . Also on the kind of emergency behavior that this Hunky had just shown . Paul moved his chin forward and said , " Understand ? See ? " Paul turned his head away then because he saw tears glittering in the corners of the Hunky 's dark eyes . The man had not been able to say anything . Paul heard him gulp and clear his throat with a rasping noise and say , " Yah . Und'stand . Rozumim . " " You report here tomorrow , " Paul said . He looked over at Corbley with an angry , defiant glare . " To him . " Paul turned away and walked quickly back to his office . Corbley was in there alone with him in no time . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . There was damn near a riot going on in the blooming mill . " You ca n't do that to us , " he shouted . " We ai n't goin ' to stand fer it . I 'm God damned if yell put a Hunky in my shop . " There was spittle in the corners of his mouth . " I 'll put anybody I please in your shop . " Paul sat at his desk , his big hands folded , staring hard at Corbley . " Ye ca n't do that . I 'm doin ' the hirin ' and firin ' in that shop and I'llhave my own men there . No greasy stinkin ' Hunkies neither . " " Is that the understanding you had with my brother ? " Paul asked . He watched Corbley 's hard face flush darkly and the eyes shift . " I 'm choosin ' the crew for that shop , " Corbley said doggedly . " You mean you 've been taking bribes from them to recommend themto my brother . " Corbley had nothing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with contempt . Then Corbley said , " There 's no use actin ' innocent in this business , Mr. Scott . You know how things is done . " " I know how they 're done out at Homestead , " Paul said , his voic sharpening . " If that 's what you want you can clear out and work fo Carnegie too . Try Braddock . They use crooked foremen there . Munhall . ' He paused . Then he slammed the desk a crash with his fist and sai " This is my mill and I 'm going to run it my way . It 's no God da corporation . " " Ye can have strikes here as much as Carnegie 's mills , though , " Cor bley said , menacingly . Paul looked up . " If that 's what you 're threatening over this Hunkyp287go ahead and strike . If you want what they got at Homestead , you 'll get that . I do n't run this mill like Homestead but by God I can if I have to . I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loud through his nose . " Go ahead and strike ! " Paul roared , losing his temper . " If you do , that 'll be the last of your damned Amalgamated around here . You 'll never get another contract ! " Corbley had no answer to that . He was cursing slowly in his teeth but he said nothing to Paul . He could never get this mill out on strike now and he knew it . The Amalgamated had had a terrible defeat at Homestead . Scott held all the cards now . There were few enough mills which had contracts with the union at all . Corbley was not a very strong union man anyway . He had always played a lone and a mean game . This Hunky was an awful kick in the teeth . There was not a Hunky in a skilled job in the entire district . It was a bitter blow that the first one ever hired should be shoved down his throat , into his own shop , hired over his head . He looked at Paul with an ugly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whiningly , " That 's awful tough on me , Mr. Scott . " " I ca n't help that , " Paul said shortly . " You can take your choice . From now on I 'm hiring every man in every shop in this mill . It 's a small mill and I do n't need your kind of  --  go-between stuff . You can do a job with the men I hire or , " Paul said , his voice much quieter , " you can get out . " " Yer father would never have gone back on us like that , " Corbley said . " My father would never have put up with your cheap graft either . " Paul took his pipe from his pocket and began to fill it . " Think it over , " he said . " Tomorrow morning that Hunky  --  and by the way his name is Liska and you 'll call him that and no dirty mouth about it  --  starts as manipulator . I 'm going to watch you , Corbley . One try at tripping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down there . " He decided not to go home for dinner that night . He wanted to workin his laboratory . Whenever things went bad as they had today Paul'srecourse was to shut himself up in his old soup-kitchen after hours andlose himself in some metallurgical problem which would blot out all theothers that beset him . Jones brought him down a box of dinner , and Paulcarried it out to the dirty , draughty room , with its battered zinc counters , acid baths , gas burners , blowers , scales and instruments . He sat on a highstool , eating roast beef sandwiches and studying the experimental forofthe new alloy he was developing . This was an extremely hard steelcontaining nickel and chrome , which was to be cast and sent on to a Navyarsenal for finishing into experimental armor-piercing projectiles . Therehad never been any such projectiles made in the United States . Onlywithin the past two years had heavy forged armor-plate for battleshipsbeen made here . A man named Russell Davenport had produced it successfullyat the Bethlehem Iron Company , and freed the Navy of thenecessity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developments went together . New heavy armor-plate meant newand harder armor-piercing projectiles . This experimental order was thep288first work that the Scott mill had done for the Government since the close of the Civil War . Paul was tremendously stimulated by the challenge ; thoughts of his grandfather often came startlingly to mind when he was alone in the gloomy quiet of the laboratory . It was very late when he finally locked up and started to walk home . He missed Edgar in a peculiar and poignant way on these trips to and from the mill . Inside the place , all day , there were a thousand specific instances when Edgar 's absence made Paul 's work harder . But early in the morning and late at night , sitting thoughtfully in the buggy or striding along with the rhythm of his heels for company , Edgar 's spirit , his pitiful , increasingly tormented personality , came vividly to mind , to haunt Paul and baffle him anew with the mystery of his brother . Paul 's greatest difficultywas trying to accept the fact of Edgar 's religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in insoluble puzzle to Paul , and a painful contradiction of his intimacy with Edgar . But how Edgar , originally the counterpart of his voluptuous , flamboyant twin , could now be seriously considering the life of a religious , was utterly confounding . In vain did Mary try to explain that such a person , having renounced his passions and appetites , was characteristically the most devoted in the religiouslife . Paul only shook his head and grieved . He often remembered a letter which Constance had written Mary a few weeks after Edgar left home . Mary had read it to him , and sometimes to this day it came back entire into Paul 's mind . " I have just come back from Dover , " Constance had written . " I went down to the boat with Ed and in all my life I 've never been through such an ordeal . He 's like somebodyliving in another world . All the week he was here I dropped everything else and stayed with him from morning until night . He played with Clarrie , and once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tea . It was the most extraordinary hour ; I ca n't remember what we talked about , except for a while about armor-plate and the Royal Navy . After a time Ed went away upstairs and P. sat there shaking his head and saying , Impossible ! That can not be your brother ! ' I 'm too heartbroken to believe it yet myself . " Ed says he is almost positive he is right about his decision . He says he will know after these two years of study in Rome . It is too strange to hear him talk . Now that the whole thing is behind him he no longer has to pretend to be anything of his old self . He just sits , perfectly still , with his hands clasped , and listens to my chatter and smiles tolerantly as if I were his grandchild . " I broke down when I kissed him goodbye at Dover but he made me stop crying by saying I 'm happy . I 've never been happy since we were children together at home . ' And with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask me , none of us will ever see him again unless we go and invade his refuge , wherever he makes it . " And then , being Constance , she had rushed on to tell Mary about her new house in Cadogan Square , " perfectly lovely , darling , just what I 've always wanted . Not too large , the most delicious pougy furniture , lots ofp289space for parties . Wait until you see my bedroom ! Giles actually comes lure once a month and makes a very dreary appearance at dinner . After he 's gone we usually have a poker-party . You 'd boil over if I told you what I won from a certain party the last time . Ah well ! I 'll probably end iii a charity lodging , the way they do in novels . " And yet , Paul thought , you were a fool if you dismissed Con for a flighty superficial scamp . In the very next breath you would run into stuff you did not often realize she had . She wrote about him , for instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When the newspapers were full of those ghastly stories of the Homestead strike people used to look at me and remember I came from Pittsburgh and ask me the rottenest questions . I lost my temper with one man and told him before he wrote off Americansas barbarians he 'd do better to look at the children in the mines here and at the working class tenements in the Midlands . I said at least Americanshad the spunk to strike ! That travelled where it did me no good , you may be sure ! " She had that kind of nerve , Paul chuckled ; and she loved her child . For all her wildness and her dissipated life , she was a better mother than Louise . Maybe it was that hard vein of masculine realism that ran through her , which made the child a personality , rather than a possession of her emotions . " She is too enchanting , " Constance had written about Clarrie . " Very tiny and dainty ; her eyes are exactly like Mama 's , and she speaks the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes in to curtsey to P. Make Paul get along without you for a while soon , and come over and pay us a visit . " He sighed at the thought of trying to get along without Mary , even for the length of a trip to Europe . Sometimes it came over him like the presentiment of a nightmare , what it might be like if she were not there . Edgar 's leaving had shown him what such gaps could be like . And withoutMary  --  He had worried about it lately and even said so to her , talking In her sitting-room after dinner one evening . He had murmured about his dawning anxiety . " You mean Louise ? " Mary had asked , laying down her work . He nodded grimly and drew a heavy sigh . " The worst of it is , I ca n't help seeing a good deal of her point of view . She 'd like to have you gone , of course , that 's no secret to you . " " Secret ! " " And I  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't here . I just want to say that . I want you to know I mean it . " Mary did not speak for a time and finally she said , " Paul , why haveKou brought this up ? Does Louise nag about me when you 're alone with er ? " " Oh no . She 's too shrewd for that . She knows if she made an open Issue of it she 'd drive me to take a stand about you . And she knows what that stand would be . As a matter of fact , she both wants you here and does n't want you . She knows she 'd be in a mess without you . " " She is jealous of the time you spend in here talking to me. "  | " I 've got to talk to somebody . You especially . Whom shall I talk to about the mill and the boys and everything else I 'm responsible for  --  Louise ? " They both laughed . " Still , you could  --  oh , be a little more attentive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing you have got in common , all your friends  --  you might get what pleasure there is out of that . " Paul turned his head quickly as he caught a catch in Mary 's voice . He leaned forward and took her hand . " You 're horribly lonely , are n't you ? And here I sit harping on my , troubles . Lord , I 'm a pig ! " Mary smiled . " Begorra , " she said , " the Paddies like pigs ! " He was almost at home now , and familiar uneasy tension began to creep as usual through his veins . Homecoming every day was the same trying experience of being pushed and pulled ; drawn in opposite directions ; part of it welcome , part of it dreaded . He remembered a day last summer when all that had been almost unbearably vivid , dramatized as a pattern into which he knew he would be forced for years to come . It had been a murderously hot day , and he had been beset since six o'clock that blazing morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked along the burning , filthy streets above the mill , his clothes plasteredto his tired body , sweat streaking his dusty face . And he had rested himself by anticipating the moment of coming home . He knew he would find the house deliciously fresh and cool . The blinds would have been drawn all day . The summer matting on the floors would have the clean grassy odor he had always loved . There were cool crash slipcovers on all the furniture . There would be a big pitcher of icy lemonade on the hall table . There would be fragrant bowls of sweet-william , nasturtiums , and big garden roses in every room . The boys would have had their baths , and , clean and pink in fresh thin cotton night-drawers would be eating their bread and milk around the nursery table . He would go up the front steps with his mind full of troubles and problems , and he would take this load , if luck was with him , to the one place where there was help . He would drop into a cushioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass of lemonade and after a little while feel refreshed enough to talk to her about anything or everything that weighed him down . He could lie back in the wicker chair and study her thin , intent face ; note the delicate lines beginning to form around her gray eyes ; marvel at the perennial beauty of her hair . Sometimes he wonderedwhen that radiant color would begin to fade . Lately he had been curiously aware of time and age . Mary , for instance , was only thirty-five . But in his mind she was infinitely older . He could scarcely remember when for him she had not personified calm , reason , order , security . He could look at her now and communicate his silent thoughts to her with a direct intimacy beyond anything they had ever known . She was the indispensable partner of his real life and his real self . He loved her in a way universal , yet minute . He loved her for her wis. dom , for her strength , for her compassion . He never asked himself whetherp291he desired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a locked vault . He knew how to keep it locked ; he could not tell what tidal wave he might loose upon himself and all the complicated relationships of his life if he should ever touch the key . For seven years he had managed to be a husband to Louise . He supposed he could manage forever if he had to . He must always remember his formula ; she was a dangerously shrewd child , always to be regarded and treated as one . She disliked his growing dependence on his talks with Mary . She had taken to watching for chances to spoil those . How devious she was , yet how transparent ! He had started striding up the path to the house . The burning sun had set ; there was only a hot red glow in the sky which would soon be replaced by the night blasts from the mills . The hall was cool just as he had anticipated . The house smelled sweet and fresh , that welcome mixture of flowers and the delicious odor of grass matting . He had hung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting-room . Louise 's feet pattered in the upper hall . " Hello , dear ! " Her high voice bubbled out as she ran down the stairs . " How nice you 're home ! I 've got your cool bath all drawn and ready . Coming ? " He had sighed and followed Louise upstairs . THERE WAS AN early morning train from Jersey City to Pittsburgh and Paul caught it in something of a daze . He had been in New York for three days and had meant to take the sleeper home the night before . Instead , here he was . He felt very sleepy , very vague . He stretched out in his Pullman chair and smiled wryly at the thought of the champagne he had drunk . He swung his chair about toward the window , with his back to the rest of the car , drew down the shade , and went to sleep . He rested profoundly , lost in heavy daytime slumber . Once when the train stopped he awoke for a moment , dismissed the impulse to find out where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second time that happened he sat up and rubbed his eyes , thinking . That was it . There had been some reason why he simply had to be home by tonight ; in New York it had seemed unimportant . It had nothing to do with the mill . Something else , somethingat home . . . that was it . Louise was planning a party . She had never taken so much interest in any festivity as this , her tenth wedding anniversary . She had been making preparations since May , though this was the twenty-first of June . She was having a dance , a real party like the one his parents had given the year Paul graduated from school . She asked if he remembered that . . . the Japanese lanterns and Mr. McGowan callingout the reel , and the lovely supper old Sarah had made ?  | Did he remember it ! He had his own memories , etched sharper than Louise 's , which twenty years had scarcely dimmed . Mary and Delia doing the Irish jig in the pantry ; he could hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the porch grumbling because there was no wine in the punch . And the wonderful talk he had had with his mother that night . Paul sighed at the unequal way the burden of years was distributed . Those early , innocent days seemed like yesterday ; the ten years since his marriage in 1885  --  good God , was it only ten years ? He was glad that he had to be in New York those days before the party . He was well out of all the mess and the endless discussions  --  about the menu , about wine ( Paul wanted it , Louise feared to shock some of their old friends ) , about a hundred things over which Louise made issues and Mary quietly made order . Paul had gone to New York to see some new guns and projectiles tested at the Sandy Hook Proving Grounds . He had made the forgings for the guns ; this was a new step for the mill and might lead to very important business . He arrived early in the morning and met the Army Ordnance officers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul so seldomgot away on trips like this that he enjoyed it almost childishly , he told himself , as the men were ordering their heavy breakfasts , which they ate slowly , with much conversation and many cups of coffee . Paul enjoyed huge dark red strawberries imbedded in crushed ice , thickly masked in powdered sugar and rich yellow cream . He had a grilled Spanish mackerel ( good fresh fish was always a treat to the inlander ) and a fine cigar with his last cup of coffee . Ordinarily Paul preferred his pipe , but this was that special sort of initiates ' gathering that called for a good Havana cigar . The party sat long over the table . Before they left , the Avenue had filled up with the crush of the day 's traffic . Hansoms and hacks and delivery wagons clopped up and down past glittering barouches and victorias with exquisite lady occupants and stiff liveried footmen on the boxes . Paul thought of his plain , faithful Jones and his two steady chestnuts when a gorgeous turnout , with coachman , footman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confection of a curled and corseted lady holding a tiny laceruffledparasol . What a strange life these people must lead , he thought . Here in this magnificent new hotel men and women were wandering through the lounges , and sitting until mid-morning over luxurious breakfasts , as if they had nothing more pressing to do in the world . Yet some of them , at least , were not travellers or visitors , they were New York businessmen . Paul knew a few , others were pointed out to him . When did they work ? At home everybody was at work by eight o'clock . All his life Paul had breakfasted before seven and left the house at half past . He always made it a point to be in the mill before eight o'clock in the morning . Pittsburgh bankers and lawyers were at their desks before eight-thirty every day . Paul could only look with astonishment at a place where nobody seemed , to have anything more pressing to do than his sister Constance must have in London . He shook his head . This was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pyramided and manipulated to form gigantic monsters like Carnegie 's steel company ! Paul loathed the whole thought . Yet , as he looked about at the leisured , overfed rich men in their ample broadcloth and bejewelled cravats , he had to admit that they enjoyed life . When he walked through Peacock Alley on his way to the cab that was to take the party to the ferry he did not try to avoid the glances of two sloe-eyed , heavily perfumed women in billowing summer silks and huge flowered coal-scuttle hats . He stared at them boldly , and they stared invitingly back . One of them flicked her long darkened ' eyelashes . Paul turned then and began to talk to his companion . His face felt hot ; could this man have marked the fleeting encounter , and could he be leering inwardly at the big awkward yokel ? For that was how Paul felt . But all the way down the bay , as he stood at the rail and revelled in his rare freedom , he kept seeing the slow amused flash of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long and interesting . The men returned to town tired and hot , but pleased with the results of the testing . They would go back for another session tomorrow . This evening they met in the bar for a cocktail , dined at Delmonico 's and went to Tony Pastor 's for an uproarious girl show . Paul had seldom done anything like this since college , and he enjoyed himself enormously . He roared at the jokes , ogled the heavy spangle-tighted girls in the front row of the Beef Trust , and joined in the choruses of the rowdy songs , as the audience was urged to do . The illusion of a college holiday was complete when somebody slapped him on the shoulder in the lounge during the entr'acte and began joyfully pumping him by the hand . " Well , if it is n't Paul Scott ! Old Angel-Face . How are you , old-timer ? Have n't seen you in a dog 's age . " It was Larry Hamilton , who had stroked Paul 's senior crew . Paul was delighted to see him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squeeze on his wits , his charm , and his money . Paul could see that he had been doing little else in the past sixteen years . " You big ox , " Larry bumbled , " why did n't you come to Fifteenth Reunion last year ? Where were you ? " " I did , " Paul answered . " I was there . I looked all over the place for you . They said you were too drunk . " Larry scratched his curly head . " Well , come to think of it , I guess I was . Say , how long are you in town ? Want to come along tomorrow night ? I 'm having a party . " Paul hesitated . " I 'd love to , " he said . He had a sudden mental picture of Larry 's party , and as he spoke , he knew that that was exactly what he wanted to do . He had not felt , nor acted , on an impulse of pure excitement in years . But he hesitated . " The trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to catch the night train back to Pittsburgh . I 'd have to leave in time for that . " Larry shrugged . " Well , if you have to . Meet me at Jack 's at eight . Sonny Van Doren is coming , and two queens . I 'll get a third for you . " He rolled his eyes . " Sounds wonderful . "  | " Good enough . Do n't be late . " Paul was not late . But he had to hurry . He had expected to be back in town by mid-afternoon in time to do an important errand . He meant to go to Tiffany 's and buy a present for Louise , something she would considerworthy of her tenth anniversary . He had decided to buy her a diamondsunburst brooch . To bring it home from New York would double her pleasure in it . And Paul knew when he forced himself to think about it , that the only happiness he had to give Louise was some material thing like- this . It turned out that he could not get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not reach the city until almost six . Tiffany 's and all the other shops had closed . Paul swore while he packed his bag . He could get the brooch tomorrow at Grogan 's ; he would have to . But he had particularlywanted to give this present the extra touch of bringing it home to Louise from New York . He finished packing just in time to meet Larry Hamilton at eight . Larry and Sonny Van Doren , who greeted Paul languidly , and three beautifulgirls were seated at a small table in the lounge at Jack 's drinking cocktails . The girls were indubitably , in Larry 's words , queens . Paul 's , with whom he was paired off by obvious prearrangement , was a tall , creamy-skinned brunette with blue-black hair built into a fantasy of puffs and curls . She had an extraordinarily beautiful figure , a slim waist burgeoningupward to high full breasts which blossomed from a deep decolletage , and curving downward to sinuously rounded hips . Her coral-pink dress , trimmed with bugles , was tightly fitted through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruffles below the knees . She put Paul at ease immediately . He had a momentary reluctance to look into her eyes ; he had a foreboding that he would find them hard and cynical and appraising . But that was not the case at all . The four others were chattering and laughing over Manhattans , their remarks a stream of innuendo largely meaningless to Paul . The girl beside him ignored her companions . She turned towards Paul , slowly and charmingly putting out conversational feelers . Almost immediately he forgot his odd fear of meeting her eyes . They were lovely eyes , very large , liquid brown . They were soft and animated , and exquisitely placed beneath wide winged brows . She had a Southern accent with a soft slur over her n 's and a slight thickening of her is and d 's . She told Paul she came from New Orleans . " That explains a lot about you , " he said . Her name was Toinette . When he asked  --  awkwardly , he realized  --  her last name , she only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had ordered a Lucullan meal  --  lobster Newburg , squabs Eugenie , huge Long Island asparagus , an endless succession of elaborate sidedishes , a rich , heavy iced sweet , and an uninterruptedflow of champagne . " Slightly sweet for our taste , " Larry said indulgently , draining his glass , " but for the ladies  --  " The ladies did justice to everything . Paul was amazed at the quantity of food and wine that disappeared inside those delicately whalebonedp295bodies . As the dinner progressed they all became more and more hilarious . They sat waving their champagne glasses to the music of the orchestra , humming the refrains , and drinking silent toasts to one another over the rims of their glasses . Paul became increasingly preoccupied with Toinette , or he would have been more aware of the great glittering place , the hundreds of other diners , the innumerable hurrying waiters , the clink of glasswareand cutlery , the exotic mingled smells of wine and rich sauces and tobacco and perfume . The air was warm , almost steamy , but Paul liked it . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all which he found intensely exciting . Paul felt Toinette 's warm hand steal into his , hidden on his knee under the tablecloth . His fingers locked with hers . When he looked at her he made a self-conscious effort not to let his face reflect the tumult he was feeling . Toinette 's lips were moist . Later when they stood outside under the marquee and someone said , " Now where , " Larry 's girl , a blonde whom he called Cuddles , said , " Why not up to my place ? " Paul looked at his watch . " I 'm afraid  --  " he began . " Oh no . " Toinette put her hand on his arm and peered at the watch in his hand . " You can come up for half an hour . You 'll catch your train . " Paul was about to remonstrate and make his goodbyes . But the others were paying no attention . He saw that they had no further interest in the matter , but Toinette 's soft urging decided him . " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hansom after her and the doorman shut the apron . Larry 's carriage was ahead , with the rest of the party . Paul immediately took Toinette in his arms and kissed her . She did not hesitate or say a word . She clung to him . There was a sweet , musky fragrance in her hair and on her warm silky skin . For the past hour Paul had been imagining the taste of that skin , the ready parting of her full , moist lips . They did not speak until the cab drew up behind Larry 's carriageat the door of an apartment house . Paul had not noticed where he was going . He followed the party through the lobby and into the elevator which rose slowly while they joked about the contraption and the probabilityof the ropes breaking and killing them all . Cuddles unlocked the door of a flat and they all followed her in . Paul looked about with remote curiosity . His mind was on Toinette . He might have found himself in Central Park and been no more aware of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared for a party ; two bottles of champagne stood cooling in restaurant buckets , and there was a covered plate of sandwiches on a bamboo table . Larry opened one bottle and began pouring the wine . There was a feeling of suspense in the room , an unnatural intensity of remarks and laughter . Paul kept his eyes on Toinette . She moved about , finding herself a cigarette , puffing her hair before the overmantel mirror . Nobody sat down . Larry paid attention only to Cuddles ; Van Doren was absorbed in his girl . Paul looked nervously at his watch . If he left right now he could just make his train . He went over to Toinette to say goodbye . She moved abstractedlytowards the hall . Paul followed her.  | " I must go , " he said in a strained voice . " I 've  --  I 've had a wonderful time . " She stood against a painted golden-oak door , her hands clasped behind her . She leaned her head back against the panel . Paul stood staring into her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you really mean to go ? " she asked . Her husky voice dropped almost to a whisper . " That would be a pity . " They were silent for a moment . Then she put her hands with a sudden motion on either side of his face . Her dark eyes were very gentle . " You do n't have much fun , do you ? " she asked slowly . Breathing hard , Paul shook his head . His blue eyes were wide , strained and glittering . She opened the door behind her . She stood perfectly still as Paul walked past her into the room . Then she shut and locked the door . Paul had not known what time it was when he awoke . He stirred , sat up , and for a moment felt only confusion . It was pitch dark . Before he slipped from under the covers , away from the sleeping girl , the parts of the puzzle fell into place . He groped for the window and raised the dark blind . The sky was quite light ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance beyond the housetops . He guessed it must be six o'clock . Then his watch bore in on him the full realization that he had deliberately missed his train . He dressed quickly . He had plenty of time to make the morning train , and he would still be at home in time for the party . When he was dressed he went over to the bed and stood a moment looking down at Toinette . With her black hair loose and freed from its cage of puffs and rats , she looked far younger than he had believed her to be . She slept quietly . Her creamy breast moved rhythmically as she breathed . One hand was curved under her cheek , the other flung towards the place where Paul had lain . He stood and looked at her for many minutes . The more he gazed , the greater grew his feeling of calm and well-being . He took two large bills from his wallet , slipped them under her pillow , and tiptoed from the room . All that came back to mind in pleasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the afternoon he woke again , stretched , and looked at his watch . He raised the window-shade just as the train was pulling into the Altoona station . In a couple of hours he would be home . Suddenly he sat up . Good God ! He had never wired Louise about the change in his train . He hurried out to the station , scribbled a telegram , and reached his car again just as the train began to move . Then , as he settled back in his chair , he remembered about her present . He had never had a more appalling sense of consternation . He ran his fingers hard through his hair , as if massaging his skull could help him think what to do . There was not the slightest chance that Grogan 's would still be open when he reached Pittsburgh . Even at that he would only have time to get across the river and be home in time to dress before the dinner guests arrived . He thought wildly of telegraphing Grogan 's and asking them to stay open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the house . He thought of telegraphing Mary to go and buy the brooch . Anything , any expedient at this point . But it was four o'clock already and thep297train was not scheduled to stop again . There was no way of getting a message to the shop before it closed . The remainder of the trip was a nightmare . He was not in the least upset by the memory of the night , or by anything he had done . But he cursed himself for his stupid , unnecessary , damnable bungling . Why had n't he wired Mary this morning ! If he had only done that Louise 's joy in her present would have obliterated any irritation or suspicion she would certainly feel about his missing the night train . Now he had thrown all the fat into the worst of fires , and he knew he would be dealing with the consequencesfor months to come . The clacking and swaying of the train changed from a soothing lullaby to a maddening roar of reproach and mockery . He felt like a half-baked fool of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unaccustomed party that he could be thrown completely off the track of his tightrope-balanced life . Why , why , why , he repeated to himself through grinding teeth , was I such a bloody God damn fool ! He was still sitting with his head in his hands when the train pulled into Pittsburgh . It was almost dinner-time when he reached the house and hurried upstairs . He scarcely noticed the Japanese lanterns in the yard , the white flowers , the bustle , and the rearranged furniture downstairs . Just as he had anticipated , his evening clothes were laid out in minute perfection of detail , and Louise , already dressed , was standing at her mirror with her back to him , fussing with her hair . Paul had resolved to carry the thing off with the utmost possible bravado . He breezed across the room shouting , " Hello , darling ! Happy anniversary . " He almost choked over the endearment . He never used such words in speaking to her ordinarily . He went over and put his arms around her , expecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rigid , and he turned her about and kissed her warmly . He saw at once that she had been crying ; her eyelids were slightly swollen and she had powdered her face with fragrant orrisroot , something she did only under extreme stress of emotion . Paul gave her a hug , ignoring her silence and her pinched trembling lips . He began hurriedly to peel off his street clothes , talking as naturally as he could . " Too bad I missed that darn train , " he said . " Gee , I felt awful about it all day long . " " You must have , " Louise murmured . " I suppose that 's why you did n't bother to telegraph until you reached Altoona . " Paul , bending over to take off his socks , had another glimpse of her face in the mirror . She looked wretched and plain . What a hateful thing he had done to her on this of all days . There was no help for it now , though . He ignored her remark but she could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened . " At least you would n't have spoiled the children 's picnic if you 'd  --  remembered our existence . " " Oh , Lou . " God almighty , that was worse still . He had totally forgotten the picnic , the children 's share in the anniversary . This was a twist straight from the devil ; he had planned the picnic himself . It was always he who thought of things to do with the boys.  | " You did n't call off the picnic because I did n't get here ? " In spite of himself his tone was strained . " I did , " Louise said caustically . " How did I know your plans ? You could n't expect me to go off and  --  and  --  celebrate your absence  --  " " You mean the boys did n't have their picnic ? " Paul asked sharply . He showed the first real concern he had manifested . Louise tossed her head . " Oh , Mary took them ! " she snapped . " You could be sure she 'd do what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly and stamped her foot . " Hate you ! " Paul turned from his bureau and went over to her . " Lou , I know just how you feel , " he said quietly . " I was very busy and preoccupied and tied up with a lot of men but it was inexcusable of me to put off wiring you in time . I feel very badly about it , honestly I do .. " She dabbed at her eyes . She was making a great effort not to break down . Through the open windows they could hear footsteps on the front walk outside ; the first guests must be arriving . " Please try to forgive me , Lou . I 'd have cut off my hand rather than spoil your anniversary . " She looked slightly mollified . Paul noticed then that she had not put on any of her simple jewelry . He saw how keenly she was anticipating a present from him , waiting for it . He glanced wretchedly at his coat flung across a chair . If only he could go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pocket and pin it on her bodice . He turned red in a sudden wave of furious mortification . Never in all his life had he felt so totally , wretchedly inadequate and ignominious . He hated her and he hated himself more . He swallowed , while she stood watching and it seemed to him , palpitating with expectation . His plea for forgiveness was a travesty without the token that would have made it real to her . He repeated somethingmumbling awkwardly , about how badly he felt . Louise 's face set gradually in the frozen look it would wear all evening ; pain and anger and petulance masked with the sugary smile by which her friends knew her best , and for which this occasion called . She turned her hurt eyes from Paul and went over to her bureau , where with a good many conspicuous motions she took an old amethyst brooch of Clarissa 's from her trinket box and pinned it in the lace on her breast . She moved toward the door . " If you are ready , " she said unsteadily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show everybody what a happily married couple we are . " THE YEAR THAT Dickie was eleven and the twins seven Louise decided to try a summer on the North Shore , and at the end of June she ' moved with the boys to a cottage at Marblehead . One of her reasons for this choice was the proximity of William and Julia . They spent theirp299summers there in Julia 's old family home , a huge , hideous mansion of red bricks and weathered shingles imposingly situated on a bluff over the sea , surrounded by scarlet sage and blue hydrangeas . Julia was the only member of the family with whom Louise felt any kinship . Also through her there would be meetings with the best Boston people . This was a prospect so pleasurable that it overshadowed Paul 's protest when the Marblehead idea was gingerly presented to him . He liked New Jersey , even if he did only get there for a week or . two a year . He liked the boys to be where they could learn to swim and fish , handle a boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his brothers and sisters had had in the old days at Ventnor , when they went East every year with Clarissa for two months . What heavenly days those were ! Paul remembered vividly the cramped , noisy cottage on the strand , the hot sunny days by the blue breakers , the endless games and races on the beach , the dory over which he and Bill had come to blows , the fishing , the barnacles , the jellyfish , the smell and feel of soggy woollen bathing suits . When Louise first mentioned Marblehead Paul reminded her of the breach between himself and his brother Bill . Why , in view of the total absence of congeniality , stir things up and deliberately pave the way for possible embarrassment ? Louise brushed that aside . She had made up her mind and she always had one weapon through which to enforce her choice . She could refuse to go away at all . She had realized long since that Paul enjoyed his summer solitude , even without Mary and despite the cruel heat . She had given up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He came for a week or two at the most ; the rest of the time he never left the mill . He knew that Louise 's motives were complicated and involved when she asked , as usual , how he would manage at home . " I ? Why , I 'll get along fine , " he said . " I ' 11  --  " " I 'll have to take most of the servants , " Louise said quickly . " Why , of course , Margaret , naturally and  --  " " Mary too , " Louise said . Her voice was flat and hard . Paul 's jaw twitched . He stared at her coldly . Anything he thought would touch off an explosion . " I could n't possibly manage those boys in a strange place without Mary , " Louise said . She had an advantage and knew it . " Or run a summerhouse either . " It was as if she had shouted at him , " Do you think I 'd go away and leave her in the house with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " If you need Mary , take her . I want the boys to have a good holiday . " " Of course , " Louise said , leaving the room , " you do n't care if I have a good holiday . " Paul clenched his fists . " Did I say that ? " he muttered . " Ca n't you be fair about things ? " " Always , if you are , " Louise spoke lightly , in her brightest tone . Paul was surprised by a cordial letter from William welcoming the family to Marblehead , assuring Paul that he and Julia would look after Louise and see that she met " our friends . " He reminded Paul of the August yacht races and invited him to sail as a hand on Bill 's boat . Paul showed the letter to Mary as she hurried about the house , list in hand , superintendingthe packing and shipping . Louise , the weather being already very hot , was lying on a wicker settee in the summerhouse , drinking iced tea , with Dickie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sniffed . " He 's up to something , " she said . " What ? Looks to me like this is the first plain decent thing he 's done in years . " " He wants something . He wo n't write you a letter like that  --  especially with Julia knowing I 'm to be there , because Louise wrote her  --  he wo n't unless he 's got some motive . " " Oh , hell , " Paul laughed . " Let him . If I get a week 's sailing out of it , it 'll be such a treat for me I do n't care what he 's up to . But I did n't really think about Julia much or I 'd have put my foot down . " He looked at Mary and shook his head . " That 's bad , " he said . " Constance told me how she carried on about you the last time she was here . " Mary made a sound like a snort . " Do you think I can be intimidated by that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own plans this summer . " " Your own plans ? What do you mean ? " " I 'm going abroad to see Constance as soon as I get Louise settled up there . " " Why , Mary . " Paul 's mouth hung open and he looked at her stupidly . " Why , Paul . " She laughed at his astonishment . " Why should n't I ? I have n't said a word about it to anyone because I do n't want a lot of discussion . I admit I would n't think of spending eight weeks in some place where Julia Scott could make my life miserable . So I decided to go this year . " " What will Louise say ? " Paul asked . He still had a dumbstruck expression . " Louise ! " Mary laughed loudly . " You might as well ask me what PresidentMcKinley will say ! He cares just about as much . " Paul reddened . He stood silently watching Mary count tea napkins into a trunk tray . " These summers are awful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she bent over the trunk . " They 're not as hard on you  --  as they might be , " she said . " After all , you do get some  --  some respite . " She shut her mouth firmly then . " Louise does n't really need you at all , does she ? " he asked . " Oh , she manages to give me the responsibility of the boys , in spite of Margaret , " Mary said . " She 'll be all right this year , so close to Julia 's house . But you know why she really makes me go away with her , " Mary said , looking straight at him . Paul said slowly . " I do n't know how  --  we  --  you  --  stand it . I do n't know . " " It 's my job , " Mary said shortly . " But I 'm taking a vacation this time , believe me . " " I 'll miss you  --  frightfully , Mary . " " I 'd be away anyhow . Besides , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm delighted . But it makes me think  --  of the time you went before . " Paul 's hand moved towards her in an unconscious gesture . For a moment they stood there gazing at each other , memories crowding the silence around them . Then Mary said , " Shut the book , Paul , " and went off leaving him alone in the dining-room . He shook his head . He had never seen her so brusque and so independent . William 's boat , Julia IV , won the cup in the August races , and he gave a dinner to celebrate the victory . Never in their lives had he and Paul been on such a congenial footing . The week of sailing was an uninterrupteddelight . William 's fifty-foot sloop was easily the most beautiful boat of its kind in the club , and many summers of racing had made an expert sailor of him . He ran his boat with all the elaborate distinctions of position that permeated his Boston life . In races he carried three gentlemenand one paid hand . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasure , and the paid hand was occupied entirely in waiting on them and cleaning up after them . He handled his boat masterfully , however , and Paul was ready enough to fall into place as the least important member of the crew . There was something extremely funny , after all these years , about Bill in a position of complete authority , with Paul springing to obey his orders . The other two men , friends of William 's named Sturgis Greenleaf and Henry Huddleston , quite naturally treated Paul with the slight shade of condescensionthat seemed suitable for Scott 's younger brother , and a Pittsburgh landlubber at that . Paul did not seem to them , nor feel himself , like the president of the Scott Iron Works and the sole controller of every cent of his own that William had in the world . This magnificent boat , bought with Julia 's money , happily dispelled all the tiresome truths about the brothers . Between turns at the wheel and manning the sails Paul , in a cotton undershirtand dirty white duck pants , lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the hot sun . His blond hair and full moustache bleached to straw-color , his skin burned almost mahogany ; he went unshaven for forty-eight hours ; he ate like a pig and slept so hard that waking up Scott became the joke of the ship . He even reached the Nirvana of literally not thinking about anything . In a week he gave not a single thought to the whole long catalogue of his troubles . William 's dinner-party was planned with as much decorum as an affair in an embassy . He took himself and all his associations very seriously . Julia , now outrightly stout and mightily armored by complacency , authorityand abundant money ( though still the income of her income ) managed everything while William importantly presumed that he did . The dark , ugly interior of the Gaylord summer home was a labyrinth of chopped-up rooms cluttered with whatnots and glass-paned bookcases full of first editions of Longfellow , Bryant , Whittier , Emerson , and Thoreau . Diamond-work bits of assorted stained glass appeared on unexpected windows , especially over staircases . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and many small , expensive Persian rugs laid in precise arrangements calculated , as Paul said the first time he slipped on one , to break your neck without further argument . The furniture was solemn and massive except for an occasional flippancy in brocade and gilt , a daring innovation of Julia 's after the long mourning for both her parents had finally come to a correct end . Louise appeared to enjoy her frequent visits to the house , the long summer afternoons over elaborate teas , with many callers , on the cluttered west porch ; the tennis parties when the ladies sat under striped umbrellas on the sidelines , murmuring restrained exclamationsat the play . Paul said he would have suffocated if he had had to spend any time with her there . " Thank God I was off on that boat the week I did take a vacation , " he said , struggling with a stiff collar . " Who in hell , " he cursed , " ever heard of dressing like this for a dinner-party in the country ? Damn ! " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the boat . My hands are so calloused I ca n't fight this . " He handed her his collar button and stood patiently while she fixed it . She was bridling with pleasure at the unaccustomed small intimacy . " There ! Now we 're ready . Come in ! " It was the twins coming to say good night . They bounced into the room , falling over each other in their hurry to get to Paul and be the first to leap on his back . They loved that game , or any other form of roughhousePaul would encourage . Best of all they liked a simulated tug-of-war when each boy would grab one of Paul 's hands and try to pull him off his feet in his own direction . Paul adjusted his falling with nice impartiality . Just now Louise stood fretting by the mirror , while the boys shouted and swarmed all over their father . " Oh , Paul , make them stop . They 'll ruin your clothes and you look so nice . " Paul removed a foot from his shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Me too , Daddy , me too . " Tommy rushed him from the other side . Paul swung him around and set him down beside Teddy . " That 'll do now . Go along to bed . " He watched the children go over and kiss their mother good night . They always treated her in a formal manner which contrasted queerly with their wild boisterousness towards Paul . Louise bent over stiffly  --  her corsets were tight and she did not want the boys to reach up and disarrange her hair  --  and gave them each a quick kiss . " Good night . Run along quickly to Margaret . " The boys ran back to Paul and seized his hands , Teddy on the right , Tommy on the left . For some reason they always fell into those positions . Although he told them he had no time , they dragged him down the hall to the nursery with them . " You have to put us to bed , Daddy . You got to . " Margaret smiled as the three burst through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . " ' T was a pity ye had to ' go off on that boat all yer week 's holiday . They 'd counted so on havin ' ye here . "  | " I know , Margaret . I was very sorry . But I do n't often get a chance atsailing . Go on now , Tommy , brush your teeth and mind Margaret at once . " He was tucking Teddy into bed . But suddenly the little boy jumpedup . " Why , Daddy , you forgot our prayers ! " " Oh , that was very bad of me . Come here , Tom . " Paul knelt down by the low nursery table and the boys knelt beside him , right and left as usual . All three folded their hands and said , " Now I Lay Me " and the Lord 's Prayer together . Just as they finished Louise hurried in . There was a pucker between her brows . " Oh Paul , really ! We 'll be terribly late . " She stood and fidgeted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downstairs , Louise drawing on her summer wrap , and on the ix itch found Dickie , flat on his stomach on the floor with his chin propped over a book . He jumped up . Paul smiled proudly at the tall , sunburned lad . Dickie as handsome in an almost idealized masculine version of Louise 's curly prettiness . " Dad , did you remember about tomorrow ? " he asked . Paul nodded . He had promised Dickie a day 's real fishing , and had hired a motorboat to take them out . Just the two of them and two boys named Waller , with whom Dick had made great friends . " We 'll leave at seven sharp in the morning . Captain Davis will havebait and everything . Will you ask Trude to put us up a lunch , Louise ? " " Well  --  yes , that is  --  " she fumed . " You might have told me sooner , aul . How do I know whether she has anything in the house to make lunchf first thing in the morning ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said eagerly , " if she has n't , I 'll run wn to the store now and buy some sliced ham and things . Can I have some money , Dad ? " Paul gave him the money and they both kissed him good night . Louise gan to fuss again on the short footpath walk over to Julia 's . " Really , " she said , " after being away all summer and then going off that boat the only week you have here , do you have to spend your t day off on another boat fishing with Dickie ? " Paul gave her a surprised look . " Have to ? I want to . He 's counting on and so am I. " " Oh . I suppose it does n't matter if I 'd counted on spending one day the summer with you . " " Why , Lou , I 'll be here all evening . Good Lord , you do n't want me to appoint Dick , do you ? Anyway , come along with us if you want to . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ugh ! Smelly , slimy oldsh . And that rocking boat . " " Well , I ca n't sit around and rock on the porch with you , my dear . Another time figure out something you will do with Dick and me and we'llbe glad to have you along . And stop fussing , please . Here comes Willy . " Willy was proceeding towards them with a slow , almost royal pacehich matched his great height , his eagle nose , and his other markedresemblances to his grandfather Gaylord . He had just celebrated his twenty-first birthday after graduating from Harvard . He and his sister Angelica , who would make her debut next winter , had understandably nothing in common with Paul 's small boys . But their gently patronizing attitude extended to Paul and Louise also . These plain Pittsburgh relatives were quite out of keeping with the whole studied picture of existence to which the William Scott family adhered . If , on the other hand , they had an opportunity to refer in passing to their aunt , the Countess of Melling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lady Clarissa WhitfieldMoulton , although only fourteen , was a satisfaction to contemplate and talk about . There was a large group at dinner . William and Julia had invited a choice assortment of Boston 's inner circle . Paul could not decide whether their motive had been more to flatter or to impress him and Louise . Willy and Angelica were not at the table . They went off to a young people 's party after escorting their aunt and uncle up to the house . The dinner was extraordinarily good and the wines superb . Paul took it for granted that Bill did himself very handsomely , but he had not fully appreciated the Boston tradition of fine dining which was part of Julia 's inherited way of life . He would have been very glad to devote himself entirely to the lobster mousse and truffle filets , but a dowager on either hand kept him all too aware of his duties . Their conversation ranged from studied comment about new books and the bird life of the vicinity to the coming winter 's program of the Boston Symphony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Adams on his left to tell him exactly who each of the eight men at the table was ; what he did ; what , if any , his business connections were . He ventured a leading question , selecting a stern-looking square-bearded man opposite him as the opening wedge . Mrs. Adams only stared . " Why , " she said vaguely , " that is Selden Middleton . I ca n't tell you exactly what he does , Mr. Scott  --  I believe he has an office in State Street , like everybody else . " Paul realized that Selden Middleton did just what William and the other men present did  --  take care of inherited money . Some of the men were lawyers ; they took care of other people 's inheritances as well as their own . Some were controlling stockholders or outright owners of textile mills , but Paul soon learned , after the ladies withdrew , that such men regarded the details of mill management and production as the province of hired factors and superintendents . It was a seemingly casual reference to Andrew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The man who mentioned Carnegie made an admiring reference to his bold vision of a vast empire of steel , and his ruthless , spectacular handling of millions in putting it together . At once Paul protested . " I wonder if you would admire him so much if you were an independent steel manufacturer , " Paul said . " I am quite sure I would . The man is a genius , Mr. Scott , and I should think you , in your position , would be best able to appreciate that . " " I do . I concede that Andrew Carnegie is changing the whole concept of industry in this country . But I feel he is doing the gravest harm . "  |p305William  spoke from his end of the table . " I think , " he said , " that my brother still reflects my father 's views , do n't you , Paul ? Our father had a Violent prejudice against Carnegie . " " With good reason , " Paul said shortly . " He saw Carnegie crush and Wallow up two of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning . I do n't believe my father "  --  he spoke to a man named SedgMik who showed particular interest  --  " would have felt so strongly if ) ' Hipps and Carnegie had n't used the iron business as they did . They used it to amass money and power for themselves . They used it to kill compe-tition . " " They drove us out of rail-making , " William explained in a rather deprecating way which indicated the paltry size of the Scott mill in his estimation . " Did they really ! " Paul could not be sure that the man who spoke was not patronizing in is remark . " That was a very long time ago , " Paul explained . He had a sense that is mill was being faintly ridiculed by these men who admired Carnegie d his gigantic creation . " We decided in the face of that buccaneering develop our own specialties and concentrate on them . " " My brother has done that singlehanded , " William said kindly . " I owed you that list of our alloys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I was greatly impressed with it , " Middleton said , turning to Paul . ou really have been able to develop and keep a market all your own , ve you not ? " " Well  --  yes . Of course it 's a limited market . We are dependent more invention and technical development than on general trends . We do most no business with railroads , for instance . " " Very interesting . In other words , you have no inclination to  --  tohatwould you say  --  get into the swim of this tendency to centralize and nsolidate the components of the steel industry ? " " None at all , " Paul said quickly . " It can be done , of course , with tremendous efficiency and results . Henry Frick is the genius at that . But has no bearing on my mill . " William sent an uneasy glance down towards Paul . There had been a Ing of something quite like defiance in Paul 's last words . " Still , " Middleton said , slowly twirling his port glass in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scott . It is hard to see how any man an stay out of the current as you do . Now I have never had anything to ( ) with iron and steel manufacturing but I have been having a very live time  --  I may say an exciting time  --  with some ore interests of line . " " I see . " Paul thought immediately of the most recent crisis in the longtandingbattle for control of iron ore . He found himself wondering now whether Bill had had some special motive in bringing this man here to wet him . Middleton smiled . " Originally my holdings were in the Norrie and thep3o6 Pioneer , " he said slowly . " They are small mines  --  of course you know how small  --  in comparison with the Mesaba range . " He paused . Paul leaned forward . " But there was practically a panic in those smaller mines this year , " he said . " Norrie was down to $2.65 a ton last month . " He bent a puzzled look on Middleton 's composed face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I foresaw the fate of the Norrie mine as soon as I discovered that Henry Oliver and Mr. Frick were about to make a deal with the Rockefellers . When they leased the whole Mesaba range and contracted to ship over Rockefeller facilities , the future of any competing mines ought to have been apparent to anybody . " All the men were listening intently . Paul saw that the only drama in their world was this one of battling elements , wills , and millions . " I suppose you sold out to Oliver before he made the deal with Rockefeller , " Paul said dryly . " Precisely . I effected an exchange of stock  --  advantageously . Very advantageously . " Middleton cleared his throat . Paul sat back and pulled on his cigar . " I see . " Selden Middleton was right now a part of the Oliver-Frick-Rockefeller ore combine which would within a few months inevitably be engulfed in the Carnegie Steel Company . Frick and Carnegie were at odds about some features of the matter , but the outcome was clearly predictable . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking . Presently he looked down the table a William . Now why , Paul asked himself , did this whole thing come up ? Why did he have that man here tonight ? And what possible concern is i of mine ? Did he think it was just a natural matter of interest to me ? The men rose from their chairs and began to move towards the drawing room . Middleton fell into step beside Paul . " Stirring times , " he said pompously . " Stirring times . We 're going t see a great many more of these big consolidations , Mr. Scott . Mark m words , if we keep our eyes open we 'll have plenty of opportunities for bi things . Big things . " Paul stepped aside coldly and let Middleton precede him into t drawing-room . MARY SAILED THE second week in July and joined Constance an Clarrie and Clarrie 's Fraulein at Deauville where they were staying in great sprawling suite of balconied rooms at the Royal Hotel . Constant was going soon to Paris for clothes , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary suggested that Fraulein be given a holiday for three weeks to visit her family in Leipzig ; Mary and Clarrie would go off aloe somewhere and " really get to know each other . "  | " But that 's not what you came for ! " Constance exclaimed , while Clarrie clapped her hands and said , " Oh , Mummie , please ! " " You did n't come to take care of Clarrie for three weeks while I go off razzle-dazzling . I want you to come with me . " Mary made a derisive sound . " I have a fine notion of myself taking the cure with  --  um . With you . This is what I want to do . I 've never been on the Continent before and I 'm just a rubbernecking tourist and Clarrie and I can have a lovely time gaping at things and reading Baedekers . You go off and do as I say . " " All right , " Constance shrugged . " Bully me about . Have it your own way . But you 're coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and threw her arms around Mary . " Wo n't we have fun ? " she cried . " All by ourselves . It 'll be such fun to show you things , Auntie Mary ! " At fourteen Clarrie was almost an unbelievable contrast to her mother . When Mary remembered Constance at that age , rough and wild-tempered and wilful , with her bush of blazing curls , turning the house upside down , she could scarcely bring herself to realize that this gentle , quiet pink-andwhiteEnglish girl was the child of that recent tornado . Clarrie 's resemblance to her grandmother Clarissa was more striking than ever . She had the same broad , serene brow , the same mild blue eyes , the same smooth blonde hair , which she wore in long braids ; above all the same soft , warm , loving nature . She had not Clarissa 's sturdy frame ; she was slight , delicatelyboned , and exquisitely graceful . She had a fine mind which , under the guidance of good teachers and Constance 's hardheaded naturalness , had escaped most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been given the freedom of her father 's library . Before she was twelve she had read all the Shakespeare , Dryden , Pope , Byron , Shelley , and Keats she could hold . She read Balzac , Hugo , and Dumas voraciously in the original , and now she was absorbed in Goethe under the guidance of her F riiulein . But above all she had amazed her mother by a passion for music . Like most people Constance presumed that musical aptitude must be Inherited ; there was nothing on either side of Clarrie 's parentage to explain It . She had discovered the piano at the age of four and thereafter spent all possible time at practising and at her music lessons . She played  --  " well , unbelievably , that 's all , " Constance said to Mary . " I mean she does n't lay or think musically like a child . Her teacher says she 's a greatlent . " " Your mother was very fond of music , " Mary said thoughtfully . " But that does n't explain this kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a pianist already . I do n't know what the devil to do about it . " " What is there to do  --  except let her go on playing ? " " Oh , of course . But suppose she expects to be a professional ? Suppose e wants to appear in public  --  go on concert tours  --  all that sort of thing ? y God , I ca n't have that ! " " Why , Constance ? " Mary frowned a little . " I do n't see why not . " " Maybe there 's no reason . I simply feel  --  oh , I do n't want her to be an artist . Knocking about like all those Schumanns and crazy people . She 's too fine for that . " " She 's too fine to do anything crazy . You would n't stop her , surely . " " God forbid , " Constance said quickly . " She can do anything she wants . I want her to be happy . Sometimes I ca n't believe how much I love that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Remember what hell I raised about it at first ? " " Oh , that did n't mean anything . I always knew you 'd feel this way about her . " " I suppose because Giles is so meaningless , " Constance said slowly . " And the other thing  --  " she shrugged . " In other words , Clarrie 's all I 've got . When the rest of it goes out of my life  --  " " You 're level-headed , " Mary said . " I suppose I always knew you had hard sense under all that gimcrackery . You realize your whole life can change in a moment , do n't you ? " " It will change in a moment , " Constance said . Her eyes narrowed shrewdly . " That 's what I 've always known , always expected . " She pause . " That 's why  --  I 've lasted , " she added with a laugh . Her laugh , like her voice , was fuller and less shrill than it used to e - It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it than whe she was younger . She fitted the life she had made for herself as her o " superb clothes fitted her . She had the best cook in London and Ma noticed instantly when she stepped from the train that her slim-lined god dess had started to fill out . There was a recently acquired lushness t . Constance 's hips and breasts that had never been there before . The he . . fitter at Worth 's remarked it too when they stopped in Paris for fitting for Constance 's new clothes for Marienbad . Constance revelled in t. pleasure of taking Mary along . " Just think , " she kept saying , " you of all people to take to Worth ' They 'll fall all over you when I tell them you made my first clothes . " " You 'll tell them nothing of the sort , " Mary snapped . " Do you thin I want to feel like a fool ? " Constance chuckled her under the chin . " None of that , now . " It was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's ; mor to go with Constance , at whose appearance the whole staff stopped the occupations and flocked about her , bowing , chattering , hurrying here an there to bring in fittings , samples , laces , embroideries , and all sortsoddments for her approval . She established herself in the largest a lightest of the panelled pearl-gray fitting-rooms , and stood there before t. enormous triple mirror in her lace-trimmed corset-cover and drawers , smo ing her Turkish cigarettes , keeping up a running fire of argument a criticism with her vendeuse and the two busy fitters , who crawled abo her with their mouths full of pins . Mary sat in the corner , taking the who scene in , noticing every detail of the exquisite dressmaking , and once , wh . Constance snapped her fingers furiously and called the embroiderer u vache  --  une imbecile for using the wrong kind of silk , Mary burst in peals of laughter . Everybody stopped working and stared at her . " What is it ? " Constance asked  |p309Mary  rocked back and forth in her chair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she gasped , " it 's just like the attic at home . You have n't changed a bit . " " Certainly not . Why should I ! Nom d'un chien , Mademoiselle , regardezca ! Vous me donnez une ligne comme la grossesse ! " Afterwards they met Clarrie and Fraulein , who had been at the Louvre , at Rumpelmayer 's for tea . Clarrie was starry-eyed from looking at the Venus de Milo ; in vain , Fraulein explained , did she try to interest her in the other galleries . Every time they were in Paris they went to the Louvre and Fraulein 's orderly plans for seeing the paintings were spoiled by Clarrie'sgoing straight to the Venus and standing , staring at her , as long as she was permitted to . " She iss so ott aboud it , " Fraulein said accusingly . " She vill not haff enough of dis von statue . " " Why , darling ? " Constance shook a blob of whipped cream into Clartie'schocolate . " I do n't know , exactly , Mummie . I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . " Clarrie turned her attention to the pastries . " Oooh , " she said slowly , surveying the huge trayful of glittering edible jewels . " However shall I choose ? Which do you want , Auntie Mary ? " They all put their heads together and consulted seriously about the pastries . Constance chose a Napoleon , Fraulein a huge chocolate creampuff , Clarrie an eclair , and Mary a wild-strawberry tart . It seemed , with the happy , gabbling people strolling by outside , the July sunshine filtering through the colonnades of the Rue de Rivoli , the smart turnouts spanking p and down the thoroughfare , and the four of them giggling and eatingtstry around a little marble table , like a child 's dream . Mary had seen so ttle of Constance in recent years . She had somehow not dreamed thatis side of her , the same side that loved to trot along on errands withary at home , would grow and develop into this passionate attachmenther child and to everything that interested the child . It was almost impossible to reconcile this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ azzling woman about whom everything from scandal to envious specula-n was whispered . It was unbelievable that this same Constance couldIrrow into this warm , silly feminine intimacy with the gusto she broughteverything else . The three weeks ' holiday with Clarrie passed like an impossibly happy ream . They took a steamer up the Rhine , they visited the Black Forest , they went to Switzerland and rode up the Alps in terrifying funiculars. hey visited churches and art galleries and museums , they went to concerts and two operas . Clarrie spoke both French and German as well as English , and travelling with her was a constant amazement and delight to ary . The child had an odd way of combining the gentle deference of a refully-brought-up English girl with the quiet assurance of a born cosopolitan . First she asked Mary 's permission or advice about each quesonas it came up , then she gave directions to hotel clerks , concierges , porters , and guides with the authority born of language and experience.  | Sometimes in the evening when Clarrie had gone to sleep and Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she felt appalled by the full weight of her strange life with its crushing contrasts . Here she was with Constance 's daughter who at fourteen had more education , more poise , and more cultivation than Mary could ever hope , at thirty-nine , to acquire . Here she was , dressed in quiet , beautiful clothes ( bought from a small Paris dressmaker at Constance 's insistence ) , travelling about like a blood relative of Clarrie 's , deferred to as the aunt , rather than the companion , of the titled young English lady . She could not overlook the origin of the whole relationship . Sometimes in these recent weeks her memory , jogged by some word or trivial action of Constance 's , had thrown up startling reminders from the past . Perhaps it was Clarrie 's compelling resemblance to Clarissa . Perhaps that reminded her , at odd moments , of the awkward gray-clad Irish child who had called this child 's grandmother " Ma 'm " in a brogued voice thick with shyness and fright . But these were not the real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . This was the most delightful , if unreal of interludes . The heavy ever-present reality of Paul lay leaden on her mind , day and night , thou sands of miles distant from the house , the mill , Louise , the boys . Time an again in these few summer weeks she had invited the thought of writi to him , of saying she would not come back . It could be done , she tol herself ; some day , it must be done . She could stay here with Constan who would welcome her . Or she could take up her solitary life where s had left it off at Paul 's plea , eight long years ago . She had never reall intended the thing to drag on this way . To come for Clarissa 's sake w one thing ; to help Louise through the twins and the complicated readjus ments was another ; to stay , stay . . . for what reason ? She could he Constance 's crisp , clear voice , that dark afternoon in Pittsburgh , sayin awful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up dynamite f yourselves . . . stand this fantastic arrangement forever . unnatur situation will overwhelm Paul . . . craftier , crazier . . . One of these da Paul is going to need ... " Mary pressed her hot eyeballs with the tips of her fingers . Her he felt like the container of a kaleidoscope ; outwardly a simple , everyda object , inside a whirl of broken thoughts and half decisions like a mess jagged little colored fragments . What should she do ? How could she on making this vast unreality her whole life ? How could she contempla the years  --  how many endless , difficult , strained , frustrated years th might lie ahead ? How could she go back ! Sheer habit , by now , if not t unremitting discipline of half her lifetime made it more natural to renoun Paul than ever to admit she loved him . She did love him , yes , she alwa would . The admission , when she faced it with enormous reluctance , w like the contemplation of a colossal , burdensome treasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to administer . One would actu sense relief if one were robbed of it . As for Louise  --  Mary gritted her teeth and shuddered . Every pers affected by that pitiful , if infuriating personality was maimed by it . much of it was not Louise 's fault  --  it is my fault , Mary sometimes sp311bitterly to herself , mine and Paul 's and that narrow rigid world we live in . And ignorance . And bungling . Bungling . Look at Edgar . Look at me . Look at Paul . She sighed . Louise loomed as the most formidable obstacle to going back . Louise appeared at this distance like a two-headed monster , showing one twisted face and then the other beneath her own pretty , sour -- sweet smile . One side of Louise would like to kill me , Mary told herself . She is jealous enough to kill me without a regret . The other side wants nu  --  there . Wants me to do all the things I do so she can lie around and pretend to be delicate . So she wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she ( an hang onto Paul . I 'm the only hold she has over Paul . She only keeps him by having me there . What a fool I 've been ! What a fool he is ! Why does n't he do something , Mary asked herself futilely . Why does he settle for a mess like this ? Why does he settle for peace at any price ? Her mind ran on , round and sound . She opened her eyes and gazed out over the lyric , peaceful beauty of Lac Leman , shimmering in the warm starlight . Its beauty had the fantasyof a scenic Easter-egg . Irrelevantly and with astounding inconsequence either view flashed through her brain  --  tall stacks belching fire andarks into the black arch of a winter night . " God help me , " she said aloud . " I ca n't help myself . " ' TER SHE WAS SETTLED at home again in the fall Mary decided to giving more time to outside concerns than she had ever done before . ought to get out more and see other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do so , but it was the sort of thing that seemed such an rt . Her sister Kate was no longer in Pittsburgh . Dan had a foreman 's in a big foundry in Johnstown and the Maginnises had moved there ee years ago . That had cut her off from the last of her own family , and had involved herself deeper than ever in the life of the Scotts . This s to stop now , she told herself . And so much chatting with Paul was ng to stop too . She found ways of being busy somewhere else in the se at the times when he was apt to drop into her sitting-room . She knew that Louise , for one , was enjoying the change . Louise had been so gay or so good-tempered in years . She tripped about th. house mming or singing in her schoolgirlish high voice , lavishing affection on kie and Paul , popping up to the third floor to visit Teddy and Tommy . argaret , the old Scotswoman , had a word , unsuited to her place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' fallen in love wi ' those bairns , " she muttered to ry . " There 's some whigmeleery beneath it a ' . " Mary knew how simple the explanation was . Somebody  --  Julia , she sed  --  had been giving Louise advice . It was too much to suppose that the two sisters-in-law had never touched on the question that had always titillated Julia 's mean mind , while they rocked and gossipped on those summer afternoons . Mary could almost hear Julia 's cool Boston voice advisingLouise that her sons were her greatest advantage , and admonishing her to play those strong cards cleverly . Mary wondered indifferently whether Louise had consulted Julia about some plan for getting rid of her . If so , it would have been conceived in some way calculated not to alarm or antagonize Paul . Something to do with the boys , in other words . Mary was writing letters in her sitting-room one dark November afternoon when Trude told her that there was a messenger from the mill at the side door . That was how Paul usually asked for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stay at the mill and work . But this time the boy handed Mary a note which she opened curiously . " Mary "  --  she read . " One of my best men is in trouble . He is Charlie Liska , the Hunky I put in the blooming mill . It seems his wife has been in labor since yesterday and is having a horrible time . Could you go down there and see if we can do anything ? They speak almost no English and have no doctor  --  the usual slum story . Many thanks . " P. S. " She told Jones to harness up while she went to the storeroom any packed a basket with necessities . On the way down in the carriage she wondered rather uneasily about these people ; how could you help them i you could n't talk with them ? She really knew extraordinarily little abou them , except that Paul had told her how he had promoted Liska and in furiated the Irish in the mill . Liska must have fought his own way sins then . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Avenue hill , and Jones began guiding the horse over the patchwork cobbles the led to the old Flat , Mary sat up suddenly and caught her breath . It wal incredible , impossible  --  she had not been down here in nearly fifteen years It was only a twenty-minute drive from the Scott house . And for her the distance , in every sense but the physical one , was greater than that U London , to anywhere . She sat up and peered curiously through the heal murk of smoke and dull wintry light . It could not be possible . This could n't be the old Flat ; there were just as many dreary shacks and shanties , bul not the same ones . She pressed her fingertips to her eyes . This was a sense tion like dreaming . Then of course she realized why the Flat was different . The flood ha ! levelled it . Memories came swooping down like sand pouring through I chute , a stream of bitter painful memories so sharp and swift that she could not defend any corner of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bent her head and let the whole avalanche sweep over her in the flood , the unearthly experience with Paul in the shack , her last viewit perched insanely on a hummock in the middle of the river when Pa lifted her out of it into the boat . She thought of her father , of James , Bridget  --  it could not be possible that such drab lives had mounted to much drama and tragedy . Only Kate was different , Kate safe in her niceP313proper house in Johnstown , with her Dan and her fine family of children . Mary looked out the carriage window again . Mrs. Molloy 's house should be there , and O'Brien 's beyond it , but the whole row had been replaced by a newer , though equally cramped , cluttered , ratty lot of houses . That tidal wave must have smashed the whole Flat into a pile of rubble . She marvelled now , when she had done her utmost to forget everything about it before , how their one house had been lifted clear of the whole melee and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old Flat and on to a newer settlement along the bottom land which had spread with the growth of the Hunky colony . She realized now that the old Flat looked different for another reason . The signs on the meagre , dirty stores , the lettering on the saloon windows , were all in a foreign language . She could not make head or tail of them . Where were Cassidy 's grocery , and McShane 's saloon ; what kind of names were Hlavaj and Kubovic and Bala ' and Mraz ? What a fool I am , she told herself . Here I 've been living on the edge of this all these years , and listening to Paul talk about these new people and now when they 've practically changed the face of the earth I wake up and realize it . The situation at Liska 's was much as she had expected . Charlie and hisif e shared a rattletrap three-room house with another family whose three imall dirty children were sitting goggle-eyed on the steps when the Scott carriage stopped there . Mrs. Liska @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaky iron bedstead . She was breathing in hard , quick rasps ; her hair , soaked with perspiration , hung dank on either side of her face ; her eyes were glassy with pain , and she was a bad , dark , purplish color . Her husband stood stonily beside her , never taking his eyes from her face , and muttering through his clenched teeth . A stout , puffing older woman waddiedback and forth between the bed and a steaming kettle on the stove ; the midwife who , Mary saw at a glance , was incompetent to cope with this ideation and could only allow Nature to take its course . Another womanhovered in the corner . Mary touched Charlie on the elbow and said , " I'mMr . Scott 's housekeeper . Tell me , how long has she been this way ? " She was afraid from his manner that he would not answer , but whenshe mentioned Paul 's name Charlie turned eagerly and did his best , in hishad English , to explain . All that day , since early the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran out to the street where she had left Jones waiting . " Go up and get Doctor McClintock , " she called to him , " quick . If he ' t home fetch him from where he is . " The trouble , as much as she could gather from Charlie 's stumbling nslation of the Slovak midwife 's diagnosis , was that the child was turned sswise . The mother could not give birth . From her looks , as Mary ) rked over her with the old woman , the child might quite possibly be ad . Mary began to feel desperate as the minutes went by and she strained r ears to hear the carriage coming back . She had never felt so helpless . e would have tried urging the midwife to do something  --  anything  --  but woman spoke no English and would not have understood . It was prob- ably just as well , Mary thought . She was amazed at Mrs. Liska 's behavior . The young woman had been a night and a day in terrible agony , and although now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes , that she had not made one sound , not a whimper , since her labor started . " And so young , " he said , rubbing the tears from his eyes . " So new for eve't'ing . Oh , my Julka . " He had only brought her over from the old country last Christmas . For six years he had been waiting , living in a filthy boardinghouse with , nine other men , working up from ten cents an hour , saving his wages penny by penny , until he put together enough to bring her over and marry her . This shack was only temporary , he explained in a desperate kind of em  --  barrassment ; he was supposed to get a real house for her right after thbaby came . But she had n't been very well , and the Michalcfks , with who. , they shared this place , were old friends of his  --  Julka did n't speak Engli- . yet . . . Mary flew to the door as she heard wheels outside . Doctor McClintock was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homes . Usually they kept to their own midwives or to a rar doctor who spoke their language . Mary explained the situation as best sh could while she helped him prepare Julka Liska . The doctor said he mu perform an instrument delivery and he asked her to warn Charlie that i was most unlikely the child would be born alive . " Olright , " the wretched man said , twisting his blackened hands to gether , " anyt'ing you make it , olright , but you save my Julka . Prosim you save my Julka , no ? " His thick voice was a croak . He kept his eyes o his wife 's ghastly face . " I 'll try , " the doctor said . " I 'll do my very best . " He looked abou grimacing at the poor light , the cramped , cluttered room , and the lack of proper facilities . Then he shrugged , beckoned Mary with his chin , an started to work . They had to let Charlie stay there to interpret the doctor ' directions to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor needed light . Mary was nervous . She was afraid Charlie would get panick and drop the lamp . " No , no , " he said slowly , shaking his head . " Doctor need light , he g it light . " He shut his mouth hard under his bushy moustache . The child could not be saved . And by the time it was delivered t i unconscious mother was in such grave condition that no one could stop think of the mangled little body which Mary quickly hid under a shee Doctor McClintock worked furiously , and the old midwife who had bee sullen and ugly at first , nodded and bowed and crossed herself repeatedly as the doctor brought a series of hemorrhages under control . All the tim Charlie Liska stood there with his eyes riveted on his wife 's face , his Ilan. holding up the lamp steady and unfaltering . Mary stole a glance at hi now and then . These Hunkies must be made of the iron in which the worked . Mary had seen plenty of things similar to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never , nowhere , had she seen such dogge . ' superhuman fortitude . She told Paul all about it , and watched his face , peculiarly attentiv while she talked .   " That 's it , " Paul said . " That Hunky struck me that way the first time I ever took a good look at him . Those people have some kind of  --  I do n't know . Most of ' em are n't much above animals , poor devils  --  but this Charlie  --  " " Well , his wife is a character too . I want to keep an eye on her . " Mary began to see more and more of Julka in the next weeks , making equent trips down to look in on her . She was a delightful young woman , warm , calm , intelligent peasant with big , bright brown eyes and  --  when er strength came back  --  smooth apple cheeks . She was only nineteen ars old . There was a solid good humor , a natural ease about her , which rew Mary as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short , stocky , nd strongly built . She had worked hard all her life , and her one misfortune id not discourage her . She was entirely reasonable . She was picking up English quickly and she said to Mary , " I not vorry . I vait till Doctor say , s , I get more baby . " She showed Mary the piles of heavy round-thread linen , sheets and tige square pillowcases and tablecloths , thickly encrusted with her own nil ) roidery , which she had brought from the old country for her marriage . he stroked them proudly . " Is fine , fine cloth , no ? Mine stryc Jaromir he gives from big land . Big lace . We make ourselves , all women together . " She indicated the spinning id weaving of flax . " We soak . We beat . We make for lie in sun , make vely white . " " It must be beautiful in your country , " Mary said . Julka nodded eagerly . " Is very beautiful . So clean . So green . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is lots trouble . We got bad people Wien me take away all men for serve in army . We got Kaiser Frantisek Pro-i zka . Czechs not like Kaiser . Slovaks not like . Czechs want free . Come America for be free . " This was pretty surprising talk , Mary thought , and Paul agreed with r . You did not think of these people as having ideas like that . You could it imagine their having had education and land and property back in the d country . Most of them , indeed , had had none . But this girl was constantly making distinctions between herself and Charlie as Czechs , and the er Hunkies who , she shrugged , were " doity Slovaks . " She had no inten-m of living like them any longer than she could help . " Come America it he free , " she kept saying , and that phrase echoed in Mary 's mindshe crossed the dirty ruck of the old Flat and picked her way overt retch of mud and grit where the Liskas and the Michalciks lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charlie and Julka hoped tmove soon , to a small house on the hillside rising from the river bottom . were steep , barren streets there with makeshift paving and rows of built mustard-yellow houses with ugly wooden stoops and open priviesIii backyards . Any trees that Mary could remember on those hillsides I been cut down long ago , to enable somebody to lay out these crampeds of hideous dwellings . The streets were dingy by day , ominous byt ; they were dimly lighted by flickering gas street-lamps too far apart , the middle houses in the rows stood in pitch dark .   Rent was the direst consideration in the lives of their tenants . For one house to be occupied by only one family was unheard of . It was usual to rent one or two of the three rooms to another family , or else to take as many bachelor boarders as could be crowded in . Entire steerage loads of strong , green young men from the Slavic Austrian provinces were still pouring into the district to fill the insatiable demands of the mills . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real steel boroughs where nothing existed whatsoever except through dependence on the mill . It was like that out in Braddock , Homestead , Rankin , Munhall , and the whole gloomy stretch of the Monongahela . In those places you made steel or you starved . Here in Allegheny there was a semblance at least of participation in the diverse life of a city . Julka planned to take boarders like everybody else . Charlie protested that this would be too much work for her but she laughed at him , callin Mary , who had dropped in to see her , to witness that Doctor McClinto pronounced her strong and well now , " strong like you . " She punched hi playfully in his barrel chest . He blushed at her horseplay in Mary 's pr ence . " Julinko , " he whispered , " we got lady visitor . You shoon ' do dat . " Mary was discouraged for them when she saw the house they rente And they were so proud of it ! Mary 's interest in Julka had grown to re friendship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not be close to su a woman in such a crowded and poverty-ridden community without bei caught up in the lives of all her neighbors . Mary found herself learning pronounce strange tongue-twisting names and understand the thick , fait ing English in which these clumsy shy women were beginning to speak her . When she first began to drop in with Julka to the neighbors ' crowd kitchens there had been constraint and awkwardness in every meeti Julka was tremendously proud of her American friend , a fine-looking la who wore a gray broadcloth dress with silk trimming , a sealskin stole , an a velvet hat with real feathers on it . But the heavy , shabby , often baref Slovak women with their broods of dirty children shot sullen glances Mary 's clothes and shrugged indifferent monosyllables when she tried talk to them . Until the day when she mentioned something about her bir place on the Flat and her memories of what it was like thirty years Mrs. Michalcik turned around slowly and stared at her . " You mean  --  like us ?  --  so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mary said . She felt a great lift inside , a sudden know edge of how to get beneath the surface of these people , under their cru ness , their heaviness , and their enormous pathos . " We lived right over that alley beyond the tracks there , " Mary sai pointing out the window . " My brother James was the boss heater at Scott ' My Dad worked there all his life . " The three women in the room slowly laid their hands in their la opened their mouths , and gaped . Then , one by one , their broad , plal shiny faces broke into slow smiles . Wonder and delight lit up their lar eyes . First one , then the next , began to talk . They all crowded arou Mary , babbling questions at her in their ludicrous English . They listen to her answers and nodded while she talked , wagging their headsP317holding up their hands and gesturing to one another . The ice was broken . rs . Benko , whose husband was one of Charlie Liska @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sleeve of Mary 's dress . The other women took courage and began feeling the fine broadcloth , the crisp fluted silk ruffles at the neck and cuffs , the rich softness of the sealskin stole . Mrs. Michalcfk even got down on her knees and minutely examined Mary 's black kid shoes . They gabbed together in Slovak . Mary looked to Julka to interpret . " They say like fairy story , " Julka explained . " Like told in old country . merica for be free and rich , all say so , most time we not believe . Make appy , you first like us , now fine lady . " Hot tears sprang into Mary 's eyes . She blinked rapidly . " I 'm no fine lady , Julka . I work for my living too . We all do . I 've just . en  --  lucky . It takes a little while  --  but you 'll see  --  " The women all nodded sagely . Mary 's heart went out to them . She could not very well see how they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted . Hope had brought them with their shawls and ndles and featherbeds , their songs and legends and dreams thousands of lies in hideous hardship . To the land of promise , the land of freedom and 1 ( 1 . And what did they find ? Poverty as bitter , a lot fully as hard as anyingthey left behind . Dirt , sickness , cold , and meagre stringency ; the terrible packing together of too many dirty , tired bodies in too few beds d rooms ; the grim gray climate , the lowering pall of smoke , the damp from the river ; for their men the utter emptiness of the time which would be leisure , and which went only to exhausted sleep , to lounging in ddy , littered alleys , or once in an intolerable while , to getting drunk . the old country there had been hardship , but there were green fields trees , church and village festivals , music , good cheap beer and wine , old ways and the old friends and the old people . Here it was too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the knowledge but the women not complain . They were strong and earthy and enormously human sociable . Every time she saw them Mary found herself doing some little thing them ; helping this one cut out a new calico dress , that one gather her hter 's confirmation veil ; holding the baby while Mrs. Siva sat down the stove to peel potatoes for supper . Always before she left they shyly eyed some refreshment , a cup of coffee with a piece of warm apple-cake , smoking hot dumpling filled with pot-cheese , or a taste of the savory soup simmering on the back of the stove . These women were eager natural . Mary found they gave her something she had never known whole life long . They and their lives and families and problems interherintensely . Paul said she never talked about anything else these days . She had tten her decision to avoid him . She was so absorbed in her new interest she could not bother remembering why she had ever had such a notion . kept track of the Liskas through her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ master at his job . Paul had been praying for a man ever since the loss of Jim Rafferty . The last place he expected to find him was in the ranks of the Hunkies whom he had so reluctant ! taken into the mill . Mary scolded Paul gently for calling them Hunki " Well , they come from Hungary , do n't they ? " " Most of them come from Slovakia , which is a province in Hungar A few of them are Bohemians like Charlie and Julka . They are Czechs , a very proud of it too . " " Better than the Hunkies , eh ? " " Do n't call them Hunkies l " " All right . Czechs . " " They are n't all Czechs . " " My God , why does it have to be so complicated ? They 're not Hunki they 're not Czechs , what in blazes are they ? " " Slovaks . That 's simple enough . " " All right . Mostly Slovaks . Some Czechs . Now have I got it straight ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Just the same , " he said with a wink , " they ' still Hunkies to me . " " YOU KNOW , " Mary said to Paul one evening , laying aside a techniq journal with an article he had brought her to read , " we do n't realize w an important man you are . " " Bosh , " he answered . " You 're used to me . " She shook her head . The article he had shown her was a report abo his work in developing hard alloys for weapons and projectiles . There w even a method of hardening steel now known as the Scott Process . Wh a man 's work was permanently labelled with his name and other ml recognized it as such , he was famous , Mary said . She smiled at Paul , stan ing by the mantel making faces over a new pipe . It had not been season to suit him . There was a terrible February sleet storm going on outsi The wind whistled in the chimneys , and through the drawn curtains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had gone upstai She must have said something to Paul that made him feel he had to j her . He was restless and he had not sat down . Mary thought of her now and said , " Louise has no idea what a great man you are . " " Oh , Louise . " He shrugged . The inference was that Louise had no i about anything . She certainly could not grasp the outlines and necessit of his life , nor the part that she should play in them . Not long since had told her that he had to begin seeing something of the newer peo who were coming to the forefront of business and social life in town . could not go on living in his father 's generation indefinitely . Louise rem strated . Surely Paul did not want to invite any of those men who ranP319arnegie mills ! Why , Father Scott would turn over in his grave if they . t foot in his house ! And Louise would n't know what to talk about with their wives . All the girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their huge diamonds and their dresses sent from Paristhe boxful . You could n't tell anything about such people . And Louise hispered to Paul the shocking gossip that one of them  --  she named herd been a waitress in a railway-station lunchroom ! Paul was so disgusted by her pettiness that he gave up any thought of viting to his house certain men whom he wanted to know better . Louise would only insult their wives and make a fool of him . Paul had never been uch of a clubman but now he took to driving across rather frequently to nch at the Pittsburgh Club or the Duquesne Club , where there were ways groups who were glad to have him join them . Their talk was satis-. ing and stimulating . Just now they were all closely absorbed in the situaonbetween the United States and Spain . Since they all knew that Paul ott had been supplying the Navy with armor-piercing projectiles for . me years past , they had a way of deferring to his opinion about the posbilitiesof war with Spain . He was always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ derby at the club door , he went up the rk stairs to be welcomed with respect as well as cordiality . Some of the el and iron men had frowned in the past on Paul 's policies toward labor . ey had thought him soft-headed . But the men who ran Homestead and gar Thomson and Duquesne and Jones and Laughlin regarded Paul ott as a brilliant steel chemist . If you got him talking about the ' chemryof alloys , you were not wasting your time . The Maine was as big a surprise to Paul as to everybody else on that rk February morning when the news came . But Paul had more than rious indignation to bring to the matter . He had known for a long time at the Navy was preparing for something to touch off a war with Spain. e orders for projectiles and other armaments had been doubled months o ; now they were tripled . All through the ensuing weeks of investigation , discussion , and diplomatic wrangling , Paul ran the whole mill on twentyurhour schedule . He was not interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Just getting set to blow the asers off the face of the earth " was his summary of the mill 's activity . He worked every night now . If things were reasonably peaceful at home came up for dinner and went back afterwards , but if Louise had started e day with a scene of some kind he had dinner sent down to the mill . Once he asked for a box of dinner on Jones 's regular day off . Mary usually iil Flora , the upstairs maid , on errands in such cases , but on a sudden impulse she decided to take down the box herself . She had never done such thing : Perhaps Paul would not like it . But he had been so excited lately tout his huge Navy contracts , which he had won under the noses of some the biggest mills in the country , that she could not resist the impulse tohim in the midst of all that . It was a raw evening early in March . Mary walked quickly , swinging e box by a cord from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As she drew closer to the mill she began to worry about what she was doing . No woman was ever wanted inside a mill . It was certainly bad form , and the men , by ancient tradition , thought it bad luck . Well , she would n't really go in , she told herself . She would just go as far as the main entrance and leave the box with the office boy the way Flora did . When she reached the crest of the hill where she had stood , that ghastly morning long ago , and seen her world shattered in one flash of catastrophe , she paused . Exactly fourteen years ago , she thought . That was something she could not believe . The fourteen years had nothing to do with it . It was lifetimes away , centuriesaway . This mill , in a strange sense , with Paul in it , was another world by itself too . Why  --  in all the years that her life had been entangled with Paul 's , she had never seen him in the mill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fact . She was dumbstruck with surprise . The whole place was ablaze with light and fire as she approached the main entrance . The sky above her head was thick with red smoke and sparks and clouds of cinder . There was a deafening noise all about . She did not know enough to identify each barbaric voice in the concert . She did not know the clatter and crash of the rolling mill from the skull-splittingthump of the slaghammer , the penetrating roar of the crusher , the imperious shrill whistles and hisses of freight and dinkey-engines . The whole yard beneath the footbridge was a snaking tangle of freight cars and flats . A derrick was loading great clanging hunks of metal onto a fla standing by an open-ended shed . Mary approached the main entrance timidly . Now she felt like a fool for having come down here . And to her consternation she was met by an armed guard . He looked at her anwaited for her to state her business . My God , she thought suddenly . 0 course the mill is under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! She fel as she had not felt since childhood , when she looked at the stern-face guard and had to say , "  --  I 've brought Mr. Scott 's dinner . " It was really ludicrous . The big fellow stood there looking down o the dainty little lady in the dark gray broadcloth and sealskin furs and his hard mouth twitched . " Well , " he said , " I guess you can take it in . " Hey . took a heavy steel chain of keys from his hip pocket and unlocked the ironhingedmain door . " I  --  really I do n't have to go in , " Mary said . She was dreadfully em barrassed . " Does n't  --  ca n't the office boy or somebody get it here ? " " He 's out to supper , " the guard said . " You can go in . " Before s thought about it she found herself inside , and the door swung shut behin her . Now what ? She stood hesitating in the corridor . If she turned left sh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort ; a blast of heat snorted up the dark ramp . So she turned right and walked a short way an saw a dingy ground-glass door ahead of her with SCOTT IRON WORKS General Offices , painted on it . Nobody appeared to be working in the ro of cubbyholes she passed . They must all be out to supper . There was another door ahead of her , marked Paul Scott , Private . She knocked on it . " Come in , " Paul shouted . Mary jumped . She did not know the habit of loud speech which years in a mill engendered . She opened the door an saw Paul in a dirty denim coat bent over a mass of papers , absorbed . " Put it on the window sill , " he said without looking up .   " Yes  --  son " Mary could not resist that . " What the  --  " he looked up and leaped from his chair . " Mary ! What are you doing here ? " He strode around the desk and seized her hands . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and surprised that he stood beaming from ear to ear . " I ought n't to have come , " she said . " It was just a notion . " " Well , it was a damned fine notion , " he said . " Sit down and stay while I eat my supper . " His face turned serious for a moment and he said uneasily , " Anything wrong at the house ? " There could hardly be any other reason for Mary 's amazing appearance here . " No , " she laughed . " It just struck me I 'd never seen the inside of the mill  --  " "  --  or me in it  --  " "  --  that 's right . And with the war about to break out and all  --  I suppose I thought it would be exciting . " " Well , it is . Do you want to see any of the departments ? " " Oh  --  I ought not . I know the men hate that . " " Jim brought you up right , I see . Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposite his own . " Sit down and have some supper with me . " She shook her head . " I 'm going home . " Paul pointed at the chair . " Sit down ! " His voice was almost the same roar as his father 's . Mary was feeling more and more amazed . Paul grinned at her as he went to work on a roast chicken . " Have some . " " Really I do n't want it . " She could not say that her heart was poundinglike a child 's for foolish happiness . It would have choked her to eat now . " Look at that , " Paul said with his mouth full , shoving a sheaf of papers across the desk . " Sixteen thousand of my best Pittsburgh stogies delivered since the Maine . " He drank some coffee from a bottle and wiped his moustachewith the back of his hand . " Those greasers 'll wish they 'd pulled somebody else 's whiskers . " " I wonder if we really will declare war on them , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We ought to blow ' em to hell first and get around to palaver afterwards . " Mary frowned a little . " I did n't know you were so bloodthirsty , Paul . " " Me ? Say , Mary , have you an idea what this mill is ? " He shook a heavy finger at her . " One fool of a woman is enough in my life . " On a sudden impulse he jumped from his chair and went over to the Old Man 's ( Private safe , standing in its corner , and opened it and lifted out the tin Iiox and quickly but gently leafed through its contents . " There , " he said quietly , lifting out the letter to his grandfather with the White House seal on the inner envelope . He handed it to Mary . She opened it , a lump formingquickly in her throat . He saw her hands trembling as she reverently held the letter , reading it with tears in her eyes . She read it several times , thin folded it up carefully and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . He put his hand on her shoulder and his blue ryes stared deep into hers . " Anybody else might think me a sentimental fool , " he said softly . " But you know me . You really know me . I tell you , " be said , " any time this country gets in a scrap , it 's my scrap and this mill's scrap . Highspeed saws and fancy springs are all right in their place  --  but this mill makes death for anybody that bothers the U. S. A. " " Oh , Paul , I  --  I love to hear you talk that way . " Her eyes were wet and shining . He smiled lamely . " I kind of  --  I 'm afraid I got windy there , " he said . " But you have to believe in something . " His chin jutted out . He put away the letter in its place and slammed the safe shut and Mary rose to go . She heard doors slamming and various bustling noises out in the other offices and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked out to the gate with her . It was almost time for the night shift to go on , and the street , which had been quiet when she came down , was black with workmencarrying dinner pails . Paul guided her past the long line of there stomping over the bridge and into the mill . She looked at some of the faces curiously . It seemed another lifetime ago that she had had a brother whwas one of these . It startled her that now , instead of thinking of James an the O'Briens and Cullens and old neighbors from the Flat , she found her self looking for Charlie Liska . She asked Paul how he was doing . " Fine , " Paul said , nodding at some men who stood aside to let the pass . " He 's a fixture now . He 's all right . How are your Hunkies ? " " Fine , " Mary said . She smiled . They had reached the street now an she said , " After the war when you 're not so busy I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It was , of all things , a house that she wanted for them . She had nev asked for anything in her life , and she did not know how she would ha the boldness to do it now . But Julka Liska had put the idea into her hea Mary 's visits to her new friends had fallen into a certain pattern . T visits were not so casual any more . They had taken on , under Julka 's pe sistent organizing , the nature of regular meetings . One or another of t women each time would get Mary to promise to come " next time by me . On being welcomed into that woman 's house , she would find the who group there with their sewing , their knitting , their babies , and the knott accumulation of their problems . The kitchen table would be set with ragtag collection of cracked cups and bent tin spoons disposed over beautifully embroidered heavy linen cloth which was its owner 's sole prid and treasure ; and in the center stood a lovingly baked crumb-cake , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheese pocket Good coffee went with these , and after Mary discovered that poverty ke the hostess from providing the cream that these women loved in it , s would slip a pint jar of cream into her marketing-bag along with spools cotton , dress-patterns , outgrown underwear of the twins which she co mandeered from Margaret , and the books which she always brought for Julka . At first she apologized for the cream , murmuring some explanati about the dairyman 's leaving too much that day , but soon nothing was sai about it . She knew very well that the refreshments were provided by din of the most painful penny-scraping and scrupulous chipping-in by all t women , with much serious discussion attending the tiny weekly purchP323of almonds , butter , poppyseed , raisins , or whatever such luxury was needed for the baking . The finest instincts of pride and hospitality were roused by these gatherings which had become heaven to drab and labor-ridden lives . Most of the women were boarding-bosses like Julka and it was difficult for them to count on the undisturbed use , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchens . The men who boarded with them worked in different if ts . Some came home at six in the morning when others were just finishngbreakfast before starting to the mill . Dinner-pails had to be packed all rough the day , meals kept cooking on the stove , children hushed so the ight-workers could sleep in the daytime . Mary was horrified when she rst realized that two men would no sooner have vacated one small , foul ad than two others , sweaty and begrimed , would fall into it . In spite of II that , most of the women made a determined , if often futile effort , to cep at least the kitchen of their house decently neat and clean . Julka was much more of a person than any of the others . She managed r place more efficiently , she was more intelligent , more responsive , and uch more ambitious than the other women . She was tremendously proud ( Charlie 's job . This alone would have given her distinction and made her e natural leader of the group . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to learn good English and under her urging Mary began giving ssons to all the women . Julka led the way in learning new habits of dress , housekeeping and of care of children . It was she who , irritated by the trusions of a drunken lodger who kept bursting into Mrs. Sivak 's kitchen hen Mary was reading Uncle Tom 's Cabin aloud , looked up and said , e need place for us . Own place , nobody else come . Nice place , bring ildren , sew , go for read books , learn eve't'ing . " Mary laid down the book and looked at Julka . The other women raised eir heads and paused in their sewing . " What a wonderful idea , " Mary said slowly . And Paul did not wait until " after the war " to find out what she anted to ask of him . The very next evening after she had been at the ill he went looking for her when he got home late at night , and asked r what she wanted . " A house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she was amazed to see w easy it was . Paul was surprised . A smile spread across his face and he me over and sat down by the fireplace , filling his pipe . " Sounds interesting , " he said . " Tell me about it . " Two weeks later he bought a small , solidly built brick house on Nixon reet , a couple of blocks above the flat land cut up into crowded streets and alleys where the millworkers lived . It was a plain house , in a block which he and Mary remembered as much cleaner and better-kept years ago an now . They had many curious twists of reminiscence when they drove bout the neighborhood looking for the place Mary wanted . Not in years , ul kept reminding her , had they revisited the scenes of their first long walks and the treasured Sunday afternoons of long ago . Sometimes they t Jones waiting with the carriage while they went about on foot inspectemptyhouses and turning up long-buried memories of their early walks and talks . Once they found themselves walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bend of the Ohio . Paul paused and looked at an ugly new greenstone house with a mansard roof . " Mary , " he said softly . His gloved hand seized hers in the dusk . " Mary . ... Rebecca Street . Do you remember ? " Her throat swelled suddenly ; she turned her head and bit her lip hard . " Do you ? " he murmured . He pressed her hand close to his side . " The wooden steps that used to be there ? " She drew a long breath . He was waiting for her answer , standing there staring at the site of the abandoned house with the wooden steps . " Of course I remember , " she choked . " Why did you have to go and ask me ? " Just then a Bessemer across the river behind them began to blow , and presently the sky was overspread with the wide ruddy light they knew so well . They turned around and stood perfectly still in the middle of the sidewalk , hand in hand , staring at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it before . They did not move until the glow had faded to one blurred red ring around the mouth of the stack . It was quite dark by now . Paul shook his head with a quick motion . " Damn it , " he said in a brittle tone . " What is it about that business that gets us like this ? It gives me the creeps . " " Come on , " Mary said . Her voice quavered and she coughed to hide it . " Let 's get on . " Julka and the rest of the club  --  they had decided to give the group a name some day , but so far only called it the club  --  were speechless with happiness and bewilderment when Mary told them that they were to have a house of their own . Some of them wiped their eyes with their petticoats some embraced one another and Mary with noisy kisses . They crowded around Julka 's kitchen table to make the suggestions and plans Marasked them for . They would knock out the partition between two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good-sized room in which to meet together . Upstairsthey would have a sewing-room with two machines in it , a cuttingboard , and all the paraphernalia for sewing and dressmaking . Mary decided to take her own equipment out of storage and give it to them . Most wonderfulof all , the house contained a bathroom . There was not one of the women who had ever had running water and a toilet in her house . Some of them did not know such things existed . Paul was almost as proud of the house as Mary . He urged her to go ahead and make any alterations , buy any equipment , that she wanted . H. pored over measurements and specifications with her , insisted on buying a good gas water-heater and a new gas range , having the plumbing and the hot-air heating system completely overhauled , and even installing an icebox , which she protested they did not need . Nobody was to live at the house , she reminded him ; it would only be used during the daytime when the women could get away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She herself would only spend certain specified hours there because she did , after all , have her own work to do . P325She did not realize how many crowded weeks had been almost completelyswallowed up in her new absorption . It was less than a year , she reminded herself one evening , since she had sat on that balcony in Montreuxweighing the question of not coming back to Pittsburgh at all . Why , It would have been fantastic , she saw now , not to come back . She was more deeply involved right this minute with Pittsburgh than she had been in years . This club that had sprung up around her , and these strong , colorful women with their hardships and problems were not only intensely interesting , they wove themselves back into the very texture of her own roots and I ackground . And the most wonderful part was that it was not in the least Incompatible with her job here looking after the house for Paul . She loved to get up each morning . She loved the precise fitting-together of all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the orderly partitions into which she divided her mind ; so much time for each thing here at home , so much for ach thing at the House . Nobody had thought of another name for it . Paul had asked Mary what to do when the question of title to the property came up . " Why  --  I do n't know , " she said . " You 're buying it  --  it 's your prop-erty . " " No , I 'm buying it to give to this club of yours . It really ought to be In their name , only you ca n't deed a piece of real estate to a dozen ignorantHunkies . I think I 'll just put the title in your name , Mary . " " Oh , no , I do n't want the house . " " But somebody has to be responsible . Somebody has to pay the taxes and insurance and coal bills and all that sort of thing . If a house belongs to an organization you have to have proper officers and a treasurer to handle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of Mrs. Bala , for instance , actingtreasurer to the Amalgamated Mamas  --  Paul 's name for Mary 's club . " For that matter , " Paul went on , " what about funds ? I 'll pay the aintenance expenses , of course , but you have to have some kind of bank account . You 'd better use your own until your women know enough to orm a regular organization with officers and all that kind of thing . No use.bewildering them now , they 've got too many other things to learn . Bedes  --  " he looked at Mary thoughtfully . " What ? " " Well  --  I kind of like the idea of your having some property of your n , Mary . " " But it 's not mine . If you take that attitude , I 'll drop the whole thing . " " All right , " he said quickly . " It 's not yours . We 'll just put it in your me for the time being . " It was amazing , with all he had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put in there , that he could take the time to think about Mary 's ouse . She had not thought how much pleasure it would be for him to go er each day 's progress in the alterations with her , to look at plumbers ' d painters ' estimates , and decide about things like storm windows , a w backyard fence , a new cellar floor , the roof , the wallpaper , the gaslight lures . Neither of them had ever had such fun . And most of their sessions over bills and blueprints were enlivened with Mary 's stories , told in a poor imitation of the Slovak women 's broken English , of the pitifully funny things they said and did each time she saw them . Sometimes she and Paul laughed until the tears rolled down their faces . Mary had not realized that all this would be a delightful diversion for Paul from his terrific schedule at the mill . He almost always came home for dinner now and dropped in to her sitting-room to talk about the House for a little while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in April he did not come in to speak to her . Mary was surprised . She had heard Louise go upstairs right after dinner , and a good deal later Paul had still not left for the mill . Mary sat at her desk for a long time , checking the contractor 's bills for the House . Finally she put away her papers and went out to the hall to turn out the lights . Paul was descending the stairs , slowly , with his hand opening and closing on the mahogany banister . His face was like stone . He was staring straight ahead of him . Mary 's heart lurched with sudden fear . Louise had done somethin Only Louise could account for that expression . Mary went to the foot the stairs and looked up at him . " Why , Paul . What 's the matter ? " He walked on past her into her sitting-room ; she followed and close the door . " What is it , Paul ? What 's happened ? " " Louise , " he said in a lifeless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to shake and she dropped into a chair . Her mouth opened ; nothing except a muffled gasp came out . She was profoundl shocked , as if something scandalous had been told her . Paul looked at h and nodded . " Sure , " he said blackly . " That 's just the way I feel . " " But  --  Paul . " Mary 's composure was in hand again . She smiled . " That ' all right . That 's fine . You always wanted  --  " He had been holding his pipe in his right hand ; the stem of it crack sharply as his fist clenched . He threw the pieces into the wastebasket . " Listen , " he said . He spoke grimly ; his voice was low and hard . " wanted children  --  the children I 've got . They 're all I 've got . All I count on  --  because so help me God I hate that woman with every ounce strength in my body . " Mary burst into tears and buried her face in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not appear to pay any attention to Mar After a time he spoke again , bitterly . " I hate myself , " he said through his teeth . " I hate myself and my life and her and the whole damned rotten mess . That  --  that  --  " he looked Mary with tragedy and brutal frankness in his eyes . " You mean  --  she  --  " Mary stammered with embarrassment . It was n easy to take a man 's attitude towards this , even stripped of prudery . " Yes , " Paul snapped . " That 's what I mean . " " You did n't intend to  --  let her have another child . "  | " Intend ! " Paul sprang from his chair and began to stride back and forth across the hearthrug . " Christ Almighty , intend ! " He laid his arms on the mantelpiece and buried his head in them with a groan . AR WAS DECLARED a few days later , on the twenty-fifth of April . aul had hardly been at home since the awful night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost have moved bag and baggage to the ill . But with Admiral Dewey sailing from Mirs Bay against Montojo at avite , the war overshadowed everything else in Paul 's mind . He infected , e whole mill , and the boys and Mary too with his tension and his passionateconcern about the performance of the Pacific Fleet . His shells were ere . He knew every piece of armament on every American ship in the acific . He and Dick had made lists and diagrams of the fleet , pinning it-outs labelled Baltimore , Boston , Concord and all the other names on a ig map of the Philippines which they hung in the back hall . It was Dick ( ) re than anything else , who brought Paul home for dinner on the first of ay . He was almost crazy with excitement . Dewey was sweeping the panish fleet from the seas . Just as Paul reached the house a telegraph boy n up and delivered a wire . It was from a friend in the Navy Department , ! ling Paul of Dewey 's complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , submerged in querulousness and nausea , was lying on her nee with Dickie reading aloud to her . Paul was waving the telegram ande evening paper and shouting . " Come on , Dick ! " he yelled . " Let 's go down to the mill and give the boys the news . " Dick flung aside his book and vaulted out of the summerhouse . " Dad ! " " Cleaned ' em out ! " Paul exulted . His face was red and his hair rumpled with excitement . " Sunk the whole blooming Spanish fleet ! Come on ! " c dragged Dick along by the shoulder . " Oh , Paul , " Louise called after them , whining . " It 's almost dinner time . by do n't you wait till afterwards to go down there ? " Paul was not listening . Dick was reading the newspaper over his milder , pounding his father on the back and giving little yips of joy . " Our shells , Dad ! We sunk ' em . H000000ray ! " " Come on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billowing in her pink muslin wrap- , behind . She leaned out of the summerhouse . " Paul , " she called fretfully . " You ca n't take Dickie away now . It 's ner time . Do n't take him down to that dirty old mill . " P328By that time Dick was out in the stable helping Jones to harness up and Paul , having grabbed his hat , was hurrying out the front gate to meet them . All the way down to the mill Dick jogged up and down with excitement and Paul sat with his fists clenched , moved by a surge of intense feeling . His shells . His very own shells . No other mill in the country even made any . If only Pa could be here ! They jumped out at the mill entrance and ran across the bridge . Inside they were met by a wave of frightful heat ; every furnace in the place was going full blast and out in the rolling mill the noise was ear-splitting . Dickie 's face was scarlet with heat and excitement . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shed , spreading the news as they went . Faces broke into tough grins , big fists shot up in the air , voices bellowed in their wake . In the blooming mill Paul stopped by Charlie Liska and shouted in his ear . Charlie 's fierce dark face creased into a beatific smile , and cupping his huge hands he let out a roar in Slovak that brought every Hunky in earshot on the run . From othsheds the men came hurrying ; heaters and boilers and hammerers an casters running from wherever they could leave their work . They crowd around Paul , shaking his hand , slapping his shoulders , talking in a babb of English and Slovak , and finally joining together in three deafeni cheers that even drowned out the racket of the rolls . Paul stood there wi tears in his eyes , clutching Dickie by the hand . He did not say anythin But after the men dispersed and went back to their places he turned Dickie and said in a thick , choked voice , " Son , I do n't want you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our lives . It 's done this for o country before , and I wish your grandfather could be here tonight to kno what his mill has done this time . " By late summer Paul was living on the last limit of his nerves . Th protocol concluding the war was signed on the twelfth of August . For t six preceding months the mill had worked at the highest output record its history , turning out the armor-piercing projectiles for the Navy . T award of that contract to Scott 's had caused universal amazement an some bitter jealousy in the industry . How such a small mill , with limit facilities , could have had the audacity to bid for and win a contract f twenty-seven thousand precision projectiles was incomprehensible to th larger manufacturers . Still more confounding was the rigid accuracy o schedule by which the material went out . That was the triumph of Paul ' management , backed up by the kind of cooperation from his men whic his competitors begrudged him . He had no right to get such work out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Scotch and local boys . He had hardly taken on any extra labor , either . He had done the whole thing with his regular force of three hundred skilled men . He had not over-extended his facilities . He would not be faced with lay offs when the time came to readjust his schedules to normal . But he could not , he told himself disgustedly , manage anything else about his life so well , or even at all . Louise 's behavior he found intolerabl She had refused to go away at all during the summer . Day after day frosty morning until night she complained , nagged , wept , snapped at the children ,  |p329sna|p|ped  at Mary , snapped at Paul . The boys grew troublesome and cranky , cooped up in town . Paul was furious every time he looked at them , thinking of the summer vacation they should be having . Mary took the twins t New Jersey for a couple of weeks finally , but Louise refused to let I ) ickie go along . Her clinging to him was intense and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get Dick out of the house and away from Louise . Her wail was that nobody but Dickie understood or loved her ; nobody else ever had , except her father . One evening Paul asked Doctor McClintock why Louise kept on upchucking all through her pregnancywhen normal women got over it after the early weeks . The doctor gave him a despairing look and said , " She does it on purpose . Every time she feels she 's not the center of your attention . " " Almighty suffering God ! " Paul exploded in Mary 's sitting-room . He wrenched nervously at his moustache . " What did I do , Mary ? What did 1 do to bring this down on myself ? " She turned away heartsick . September nineteenth dawned just like any other Monday . The sun was too high and too hot for a fall day . The boys , cheated of their summer by the sea , were pale and peaked and cranky . Louise , late in her sixth month , was unbearably trying . Today was washday . Mary was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , and Flora was moaning in her room with cramps . And it had been only on the Saturday before , when the mail came , that Mary realized today would be the twenty-fifth anniversary of her arrival In this house . Constance , of all people , had remembered and reminded her ! ( ) n Sunday night Mary knelt by her bed in Constance 's old room , surrounded by pictures and mementos of long-treasured events , memories that harked all the way back to the first journey she had taken with the family when they all went to Boston for William 's wedding . Vividly Mary remembered the twins in their pork-pie hats and copper-tipped shoes . Vividly she remembered William Scott , bearded and majestic , carving the roast mutton on her first night with the family . Richard Kane 's ghastly face flashed through her mind as she thought of that night ; and flashing , carried a strange , sharp impression of Louise . How could you contain the vast accumulation of these memories ! Diary wondered , resting her forehead against the patchwork quilt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over her rosary . The remotest chords in her mind seemed to chant Hail Mary , Holy Mary while all in the front of her head this mass of memories and pains and sorrows and , she thought , singularly few joys , swirled and mounted tumultuously . Paul . Paul . Paul was everywhere . Down in the shanty on the Flat ; holding her in his arms under the trees the night Constance eloped ; following her to the attic when she went to get out luggage to pack for Lonon . How could she remember these moments , she asked herself , odd , ogle , striking things which flew at her out of the buried past , when theowded present was heavier still with Paul 's daily presence ? And James ! How he would have driven himself and the men this past year when the mill was working with every expert eye in the nation focussed on it ! He and Charlie Liska were two of a kind . . . but James ' would n't have liked Charlie . . . that was a strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the unknown yield that secret some day ? Edgar ; dear Edgar who had sent her the most beautiful letter , and a Missal magnificentlyprinted and bound by the monks at Monte Cassino . Constance , above all . Next to Paul she loved Constance better than any living soul . Constance 's letter , coming on the same ship as Edgar 's , had gone to Mary ' heart with intense poignancy . " We ca n't see , darling , " Constance had said in closing , " why our lives take the shapes they do . I have no religion , but I do believe in something . I think it 's simply you . You represent all the faith and loyalty and decency and virtue I ever knew . More than Mameven , because Mama did n't carry the cross you bear . I know . Never forg that I know , it 's the only thing I can give you . " Only Paul had not mentioned the day , and Mary dismissed any possibility that he could remember it . How could he , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ? She went downstairs early after telling Flora stay in bed with a hot-water bottle . Breakfast proceeded as usual . Lou ' remained upstairs while Mary , in order to supervise the boys , took h place at the table . Paul finished his coffee and his Gazette , kissed Tomm and Teddy as Margaret took them upstairs , looked at Dick 's arithmet lesson , and left the room after Mary . He knocked on the door of her si ting-room and entered . She was just about to go down to the kitchen make the marketing list with Anna . Paul went over and took her in h arms and kissed her gently . " I do n't know what 's the phrase for the occasion , " he said , " but I don have to say it anyway , Mary . " They stood for a moment , each gazing the other 's face . She had thought Paul looked just the same , ever since had grown that impressive moustache . But he did not . Lines had du themselves between his nose and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chin had filled in with a little flesh ; there were two heavy perpe dicular grooves in his forehead . His grave eyes studied her carved featur The fine , high-bridged nose , the deepset , penetrating eyes ; the beautif white forehead with the crisp hair springing up from it  --  Paul put fingers on her shining hair . " It 's fading , " Mary said with a shaky laugh . " I 'm forty years of See ? " She stretched her fingertips over her right cheek , turning it a lit toward the light . " Wrinkles , too . " Paul swallowed . He put his hand into his pocket and brought out purple velvet jeweler 's box , with a small white envelope tied to it . thrust it into Mary 's hands and then blew his nose loudly . She opened envelope first , very slowly . Constance 's handwriting ; For our Mary , the twenty-fifth anniversary of her love , loyalty , and devotion to us . C stance , Edgar , and Paul . Tears ran down Mary 's cheeks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mary . " She touched the spring . The lid flew open , there was a flash of col and her hand snapped the box shut again . She went over to her deskP331tuft down and put her head on her arms and sobbed . Paul went and knelt beside her . He whispered in her ear for a moment , dried her eyes with his handkerchief , and making a poor effort at recovery , said , " Come on now , Mary , let 's really look at it . It 's quite nice , you know . " She laughed then and opened the box once more . A watch lay on white velvet ; a chatelaine watch on a bowknot pin . Three superb pear-shaped emeralds were set with their points centered to form a shamrock on the watch-case , completely surrounded by a paving of small diamonds . The pin was a twisted ribbon of emeralds and diamonds exquisitely worked together . " It 's  --  beautiful , " Mary breathed . " It 's the most beautiful thing I ever w . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't be for met " she said uddenly . The door opened . Paul sprang to his feet . Louise stood in the doorway , er swollen body draped in an orchid-colored wrapper , her brown curls usled from the pillows . Her face was puffy and grayish . " What are you doing here ? " she asked in a vicious tone . Paul looked at her coolly . " Today is the twenty-fifth anniversary of Mary 's coming to our mily , " he said calmly . " I have just given Mary her present from all us . Louise gasped sharply . She looked from Paul to Mary with a quick ap of her head . Two expressions flashed across her face ; first she started smile , that saccharine smile of long habit ; then her brown eyes narrowedd she pinched her mouth shut . Mary was still sitting quietly staring ate watch in its box . She expected to hear anything , but Louise only said , id with sarcasm , " Ah , an anniversary . Why did n't you tell me ? We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened his mouth and started to say something . But Mary looked quickly and said , " Oh , it 's nothing to make a fuss about , Louise . I would n't have wanted you to bother . " Louise was moving across the room from the door . Her eyes were glued the box on the desk . " Let me see that , " she said . Her voice sounded strangled ; she had ed to make it light and casual but she was choking with rage . Mary sat back and kept the open box between her hands . She let Louise k over her shoulder at it . Instinct told her , without her looking at uise 's twitching fingers , what would have happened if she had let her ch the box . Louise stood there , breathing loudly through her mouth . ul watched her in a cloud of resentment and dull disgust . Louise mum- ( I something inarticulate , swept the desk with her sharp eyes , and itched up the card which was lying on it . " Constance , Edgar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then she screamed suddenly , " I do n't believe a word of it . They had nothing to do with it . u gave her that piece of jewelry , " she panted , walking slowly towards ul . Her swollen breasts swung inside the loose wrapper . " Did n't ? "   Mary closed her eyes and shuddered . Paul stood staring coldly at Louise . " I just told you , " he said , " that my brother and sister and I gave Mary that watch and I will not insult Mary or them or myself by any further talk about it with you . Go upstairs and go back to bed . " Louise 's hands shot above her head , fists clenched and shaking in wild gesture . " You 're a liar ! " she screamed . Paul 's mouth set in a tragic downwar line , too awful for mere shame . Mary sat with her head turned away toward the wall . Paul 's nostrils flared and he took a letter from his pocke handing it to Louise with a contemptuous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You can read it and see all his direction to me about this present . Even "  --  Paul 's voice was quavering with disgus and rage  --  " how I was to draw on his account and Constance 's for thei share of  --  the bill . " He did everything he could to put insult into his choice of words . Louise stood reading the letter , her hands shaking and her chin quavering . Her mouth hung open . She looked up dully and said , " Som times I 'd like to kill you . " Paul stood perfectly still . " I wish to God you would . Since I ca n't ho , for such a happy release , will you please go upstairs and let me get myse in hand before I go to the mill . " He opened the door and pointed . Louise hesitated , her glance dartin from Paul to Mary and back . She moistened her lips . Then she appear to realize suddenly what a dreadful spectacle she had made of herself ; sh drew herself up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be waiting f you when you come home this evening . I want to talk to you then . " Mary sat wretchedly at her desk . Paul walked the hearthrug . Mar said finally , " You are n't going to let her put on another scene like tha tonight ? Do n't subject yourself to it , Paul . I 'm leaving . " He did not really take that in . If he had thought she meant it he would have gone to pieces himself . He was hideously shaken . He only said , " 0  --  well . Yes . For the time being . " Mary knew better than to argue about that now . She was leaving . I was entirely unthinkable to do anything else . But she would try to do i without too drastic punishment of Paul . She at least would be as undr matic as it was humanly possible to be . Paul stopped pacing . He said , " Once for all this thing is going to thrashed out . Sick or well , pregnant or not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for . I 'm going to the mill now "  --  he looked hastily at his watch " I 'm late for an appointment . But I 'm coming back here tonight and tell Louise precisely what her orders are from now on . I 've had enough . " " But , Paul . " Perhaps she should try to explain . " Yes ? " Even to Mary his tone was sharp and severe . " I do n't think I can stay here under these circumstances . It 's always been  --  difficult . I think I ca n't cope with it any longer . " " The circumstances will be different , " Paul said firmly , " and you wi stay . Unless you 'll go away with me , Mary ? " " Holy Mother of God ! " She covered her face with her hands .   " I admit it would be impossible now on account of the boys . So  --  " There was no use trying to argue or explain anything to him now . She had never seen him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rude up , her own will just as stubborn as his , but this was no time to set he issue . She merely said , " I 'll be away -- later  --  Paul  --  " He nodded silently , turned , and left the room . THE DAY PASSED curiously fast . Down at the mill Paul drove himself at ouble speed , avoiding even a possible five minutes in which to think . He w as many people , listened to as much talk as he could . He drove overthe club for lunch and thoroughly enjoyed the comments of the men ho were still talking impressively about Scott 's remarkable feat with the avy projectiles . Promptly at six o'clock he closed and locked his office , tit on his hat , and walked briskly home . He had a romp with the twins in e yard , helped Dick to do his homework , and ate dinner alone with ho in the cool , dark dining-room . They talked about open-hearth alloy rocesses the whole time . Paul had a strange sense of detachment from some major segment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , perhaps a pulp of hysterics . He had not thought and would not think of r until it suited him to do so . After Dick went upstairs to bed Paul sat and smoked his pipe for a while in the back parlor . Once he opened the door into Mary 's sitting- ) m . He lit the gas there and walked slowly around the room , reading the ties of the books in the shelves , idly picking up and setting down a tea-cup , staring at her silver-backed blotter with its traces of her fine , pointed and writing . He did not believe for a moment that she had left here for owl . He was actually too stunned for such a thought to penetrate his head . t was only natural for her to go away now . She must be down at the ( ) use , he thought . That was where she would go . Thank God he had night the House . Thank God for anything that might give her a fragmentpeace and respite . He knocked out his pipe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louise was sitting up in bed knitting a pink baby-jacket . Her hair wasushed and tied round with a ribbon and her face , puffy and unhealthy()ugh it was , freshened and powdered with orris-root . She lifted her faceif expecting Paul to kiss her . He ignored the motion and went and sat down by the hearth . Neither of them spoke for some time . Then Louise Midi , " I 'm sorry about this morning , Paul . I did n't mean what I said . " Paul said , " Those are not things you can say and take back afterwards , Louise . " She sniffed . " Well , I 'm apologizing anyway . "   " I accept your apology for myself if it 's any comfort to you , " he said , " but I can not forgive your insulting Mary . " Louise laid down her knitting . It was irregular and full of lumps and holes . Even a man could see that . " Always full of concern for Mary , are n't you ? " she whined . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louise repeated sharply . He looked up and stared at her . " The time has come , " he said , " for you to pull yourself together . I 've tried my level best for thirteen years to  --  " " Oh , " she said . " So you even know how long we 've been married Since you forgot our tenth anniversary and remembered this thing of he today I 'd have thought you would n't notice  --  " " Louise ! " Paul had never spoken to her in such a thunderous tone . S looked at him , startled , and began to cry . " Well , it 's true , " she wailed . " How do you think I felt seeing tho emeralds ? Emeralds  --  for a servant  --  after the way you treated me ? " " The watch was not my idea . It was Constance 's . " " Oh . " Louise drew herself together in bed like a cat about to sprin " I suppose your whole behavior toward Mary was Constance 's idea . guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your life was Constance idea . I  --  " Paul braced himself . " Something 's got to be done to straighten y out , " he said . " You lie up here brooding and inventing things and feedin yourself on them until you 're poisoned through and through and incapab of a decent thought . " " Oh , I do ? Maybe I like to lie here alone and brood . Try it sometime Try it , instead of sitting down there in that nasty room talking secrets with her . Try remembering I 'm your wife and see how that feels ! " " As if I could forget it ! " " There . You see ? " Louise heaved her heavy misshapen body from h bed and lunged across the floor . She stood swaying in front of Paul . H toes curled down on the carpet . " I told you I was going to talk to you and now I 'm doing it . No you 'll sit there and listen to me . " She licked her lips . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long enough . She 's got to go . " " She has gone . " Paul ignored Louise 's gasp . " But she 'll be back , " said . " I mean her to come back . " " You would have the indecency to say that . Why , you 're admitti right now what she means to you . And I wo n't have it ! " Louise 's voice slid upward to a shriek . " I wo n't have it . Flesh and blood ca n't stand i That  --  that  --  " she gargled thickly . " Under the same roof with your o sons . I was crazy ever to let you bring her here . " Paul looked at his wife with loathing . " It was because you are cr that I had to bring her here . " " Wha  --  " she drowned her own words in a drawn-out scream . S dropped on her knees and began beating her clenched fists on the floc Her tangled hair fell over her eyes . She began to sob and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the shoulders , and propelled her back to bed . She kicked and struggled , but let him seat her on the side of the bed , swing her swollen legs into it , and draw the covers over her . She flung herself on her side and sobbed into the pillows . Paul stood and watched her for a time . Then he sat down on the edge of the bed and put his hand on her shoulder . " Lou , " he said quietly . " I do n't claim to be all in the right and you all in the wrong . We 've got to work something out . Something at least that will keep things together on account of the boys . But one thing you must get through your head . You have never acted like a grown-up woman about your house and your children and your responsibilities . That was why I had to bring Mary here when Mama was dying . Somebody had to  --  " " My house ? My children ? " she cried , gasping . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You took them away from me and gave them to her ! " Paul sighed . " That 's not true . You had your chance . I let you go on by yourself for five years , remember that  --  before I had to step in and do something . Even then you did n't protest her coming here . You liked it . It left you free to  --  " " To have more children for you . To be sick and miserable twenty-four hours a day . Too bad you ca n't have a baby and see how I feel now . You ought to know what it 's like . " She clutched her breast with her veined , edemic hands . Her brown eyes had no trace of their softness or brightness ; they were hot , clouded , and red-rimmed . She was , Paul thought , the most awful sight he had ever laid eyes on . He pressed his hands to his throbbing head . Nothing , he knew perfectly well , could come of this scene . All his firm talk of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was trapped . For the first time he realized that Mary would have to go . To give in to this mass of shuddering , noisy flesh on the bed would mark the last milestone of his undoing . But he would have to do it . After this Mary could not , even if she would , be subjected any longer to life in the house with Louise . Then he thought of the boys . How could he , how could any rational person , leave three  --  no , four  --  children in the house with this slobbering hysteric ? He could get another housekeeper , he would have to ; but who on earth , withoutMary 's compelling motive , would stay in such a place ? He shook his head wretchedly and sank into a chair , clutching his skull between his hands . Louise sat and eyed him through twitching , narrowed lids . He looked up presently and said in a dead voice , " The awful thing is , I 've tried so hard . " She gave a shrill cackle . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fool me all these years while you carried on with a servant right under my roof . " Her jaw wagged . " Liar . " Paul clenched his fists and rammed his gritted teeth against them . Louise sat hunched and tense in the middle of the bed , her mouth open and moving . He looked at her and said hoarsely , " I 'm damned sorry that is n't true . " She caught her breath with a sharp noise . " So you admit it ! " she screamed . " You admit you 're in love with her . You always have been.  | Everybody knows it . Everybody in your family , everybody in town . It 's been a scandal for twenty years . " " Then why in the name of Almighty God did you marry me ? " Paul 's voice was leaden . " I do n't know , " she wailed . " I suppose because I 've always loved you . Daddy always wanted me to . I always did what Daddy said . I thought your  --  your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young men did things like that . And then you brought her  --  her "  --  she ground her teeth  --  " right into the house where you could  --  " " Shut up ! " Paul sprang from his chair and roared . " I wo n't . It 's true . It 's all true . You 've done  --  those things with her  --  " " You did n't keep me from her , " Paul said slowly through his teeth , spacing his words . " Not you . My boys did . I tried to make a home for them . I had only her to help me  --  " " Help ? " Louise screamed . " That 's why you bought her that house in Nixon Street  --  so she could help you there . Go on and keep your dirty biddy of a mistress , go on , go on  --  " " All right ! " Paul strode to the door . " So help me God , I will ! " The house shook as the street door slammed with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mill district , his feet moving in great pounding stamps , his coat flying open as he walked . He was not thinking . He did not know what was driving him , what might be the end of the seething fury in his body and his head . He wanted only motion . No thoughts . When he did look up and focus his eyes away from the toes of his boots , he found himself staring at the dark front of the house in Nixon Street . He stood there . He thought he meant to walk up the front steps and put his big thumb on the doorbell and hold it there until she came and opened the door . He meant his hands and feet to do those things . But nothing happened . He stood in the street and stared at the plain dark green door with the polished brass handle , at the neat , drawn window shades . He knew she was in there . He did not think she had gone anywhere else . He belonged in there too . He belonged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raise itself and ring the doorbell ? He turned slowly away , his head bent , his heavy shoulders sagging . He could not do it . If he had done it he would have asked one thing more of her when she had already turned the whole stream of her life into a tortuous false channel which he had dug . He had left its true course dry and barren . The one he had shaped was painful , too deep , too jagged . He could not ask anything more . He never knew that he had stood two hours in that street . He moved on down the hill now , still blind to his whereabouts , still going by instinct , making his way through the maze of alleys that convergedon the street leading to the mill . A raw wind ruffled his bare head and swept through his light suit . He stalked along looking neither right nor left , sensible only of a desire to hold his mind closed  --  closed , he told himself over and over , against the merest possibility of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would have to do the hardest , longest , P337most painful thinking of his entire life . He could not face that yet . It took all the strength he had to keep from thinking or feeling anything now . His laboratory , off at the end of the casting-shed , had a door of its own opening out on the yard . Paul took his keys from his pocket , unlocked this iron door , and stepped inside . Part of the mill was still running on night shift , but not this part . From the farthest end of the buildings he could hear the clatter of the rolling mill . He lit the gaslights , hung his coat on a hook , put on an acid-proof apron , and immediately plunged into a formula on which he had been working for some time past . It was complicated and absorbing ; but from time to time the furiously suppressed volcano in his brain stirred and rumbled and threatened to erupt . Each time Paul cursed and rammed it back . He had been there several hours , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard running footsteps outside in the cindery yard , then pounding on the laboratory door . Paul looked up , twitchingwith anger . " Who 's there ? " " It 's me , sir  --  Jones . " " What do you want ? " " Open the door . Please , Mr. Scott , please  --  " Paul opened it . Jones was panting , terror in his face . He stumbled over the threshold . " What 's the matter , Jones ? " " Please , sir  --  I  --  they sent me  --  " his Adam 's apple bobbed inside the collar of his nightshirt , over which he had dragged on his trousers and broadcloth coat . " Jones , tell me at once what 's happened . " The man began to blubber . " Mrs. Scott , sir . Jesus  --  it 's Mrs. Scott . " WILLIAM SCOTT had not been inside the mill for seventeen years . This December afternoon , gray and gloomy and thick with the acrid fumes of soft coal , reminded him startingly of the day he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed , he thought , driving in a livery hack from the Pennsylvania Station across the Manchester Bridge to the mill . He sat silent , quite ignoring his companion who leaned forward from time to time to look up and down the stretch of the many-bridged river and exclaim at the blazing furnaces which trimmed it like devil 's jewels . Nothingseemed to have changed here , William thought . But this was the first Year of a new century , and the age had shaken itself and come to birth a lull-grown giant . This hill-jagged region of belching stacks , bare stripped coal lands , mile upon mile of sprawling , wildly illuminated sheds from hich endless trainloads of rails and girders and bridge spans and pigs and sheets and bars and billets and ingots streamed out across the country  --  this region too had come of age . It was visibly scarred and torn , aged and blackened . Its riches of money and power , vast beyond any kingdom 's , were not to be seen among the stacks and cinders and flatcars and fires . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where William felt at ease . For years he had watched in wondering admiration while wealth joined with wealth , force with force , to weld and compress these galvanic forces into ruthless bludgeons of financial power . He looked curiously at the Scott mill as the horse clopped along the cobbled approach to the entrance . It did not seem possible that this tangle of dirty sheds and blackened stacks and the bulky monstrosity of the old Henrietta could comprise anything anybody could want . He had loathed it with every nerve and fibre the first half of his life . But he saw it in a different light today . He was fifty now , and he looked all of that descending stiffly from the cramped hack and escorting his companion over the bridge to the main entrance . William had not seen this bridge since before the tragedy of his father 's death here . He looked curiously at the oft-renewed coal-black planks as if they could hold some trace of the Old Man 's presence . Paul met them at the door of the outer office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They all shook hands gravely and took places around a fumed oak table which replaced the older one of William 's bitter memories . " Well , " said Paul tentatively , " this is quite a surprise . " William cleared his throat . " It 's very natural to see you here at the old stand , Paul . How are things ? " " Pretty good . I ca n't complain . " Paul was handing cigars round and filling his pipe . " We 've had a busy year . I suppose you know I sent samples of our new rapid-cutting tool steel to the Paris Exhibition last summer , Bill . It seemed to make quite an impression . " " I know about it , " Middleton said with a smile . " I was there . It made more than an impression , it was a sensation . Of course , " he said gruffly , " I do n't understand much about the technicalities of these things , Mr. Scott , but this mill of yours has attracted remarkable attention the past two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Paul said , " we work hard . " There was an awkward silence . Then William said , " Paul , I suppose we might as well come to the point . Middleton came out here with me because he has something he wants to talk over with you . It concerns all of us in the family and I  --  well , I 'm deeply interested . " Selden Middleton looked from one of the Scotts to the other , shooting his heavy-browed eyes from William 's faded , narrow face to Paul 's broad , serious , kindly one . William Scott 's high forehead was accentuated by sparse gray hair . Paul 's head had a look of abundance and solidity ; his blond hair and full moustache were as thick as ever , though faded in color . He bent his head and stared back at Middleton from lowered eyelids . " Why do n't you start right in and talk ? " he asked . P339Middleton examined his cigar . " I suppose you know , " he began slowly , " that all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been moving toward a climax lately . " Paul nodded , quite expressionless . William watched him closely , turning sidewise in his chair to avoid facing his brother directly . Middleton spoke very slowly , choosing his words and keeping his eyes on Paul . He had a feeling already that nothing he was about to say would come as a surprise to this man , or would elicit any spontaneous reaction . He had come prepared to play his cards very close to his chest ; he was a bit nonplussed to find that Paul Scott already gave indications of doing the same thing . Somehow he had sized him up differently at their one meeting in William Scott 's house . Perhaps it was the surroundings , grim and noisy , with a freight engine hissing outside the dirty windows , that set him unaccustomedlyill at ease . " Now you may remember , " Middleton continued , " that when we met a few years ago I mentioned to you my interest in the Oliver Iron Mining Company . That was the beginning of a series of moves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coke Company . " He paused . Paul still listened attentively and inscrutably . " You will forgive my going back into certain personal details , " Middletonsaid with a deprecating gesture , " but I want to give you the background of this whole picture . " " By all means , " Paul said . " Good . Of course you followed the negotiations last winter when the Frick Company was merged with the Carnegie Steel Company . That resulted in the arrangement by which we  --  I mean the Frick stockholders , who supported Mr. Frick during Carnegie 's attempt to oust him  --  have now acquired stock and bonds of the Carnegie Steel Company in exchange for our previous holdings . " He paused to relight his cigar . " I have some four hundred and fifty shares of stock in the Carnegie Company , " Middleton said slowly , " and approximately an equal holding in bonds . " He stopped speaking as if to allow Paul to calculate the value of these holdings , which Paul promptly did . The Carnegie stock had been issued at par @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest therefore was about a million altogether . Paul 's eyebrows moved slightly . He smiled a little and said , " And the next step is this billion-dollar consolidation they are putting together in New York and calling the United States Steel Corporation . " Now Middleton smiled . " Correct , " he said . " We watch these things out here , " Paul said , " in a kind of a way . That was quite a junket those bankers made to visit Henry Frick here . " " There have been quite a few meetings in New York also , " Middleton said . " Oh yes . Bill here thinks I hate Carnegie so much I do n't even noticeP340his existence , but I hear about it when he gives those little dinners for J. P. Morgan and Charlie Schwab . Well , Mr. Middleton , what next ? " Middleton felt more on the defensive than ever . But , imperturbable in his bearded dignity , he took an alligator-skin letter-case from his breast pocket , extracted a memorandum from it , and held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , " for the prospective steel corporation include some dozen or so companies and mills . Let 's just run over them  --  it would be informative , I think . " He cleared his throat and read from the memo in his hand . " First , the Carnegie Company . One hundred and sixty million each of capital stock and of bonds . " William swallowed and turned toward Paul . " Think of it ! " he exclaimed . " Think of the size of it ! " " I am thinking , " Paul said shortly . " Go on , Mr. Middleton . " " Then comes the Federal Steel Company , with forty-six million in common stock , fifty-three million preferred . These are round figures , of course . Then the National Tube Company , about forty million each of common and preferred . National Steel Company , around thirty million of common and of preferred . American Bridge Company , thirty million of each . American Steel and Wire Company , forty-nine million common , thirty-nine preferred . " William was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Paul sat back , smoking his pipe . " Next the American Tin Plate Company , with thirty million common and eighteen preferred . American Steel Hoop Company , nineteen million common , fourteen million preferred . American Sheet Steel Company , twenty-four and twenty-four . The Lake Superior Iron Mines , twenty-nine and a half million common . " He paused . Then he said , " As you of course see from this list , Mr. Scott , the basic idea is to put together a corporation which will contain at least one of every kind of major steel producing unit . We have covered the field thoroughly . Ore , coal , coke , transportation both land and water , blast furnaces , plants devoted to Bessemer and open-hearth steels ; crucible steels ; rail , bridge , sheet , plate , tube , and wire mills  --  well , I need not bore you with details about which you are infinitely better informed than I. The point is , finally  --  " he hesitated . " That you want an alloy and specialty-steel mill , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back and smiled . William heaved a sigh as if of relief . He was unexpectedly grateful to Paul for coming out with the thing himself . Paul champed his pipe-stem reflectively . " Well , now , Mr. Middleton , " he said , " do n't you think my  --  our  --  mill is a bit smallish in that kind of company ? " He pointed to the memo . " We 're just a little family concern . This is n't our kind of speed . " William broke in . " It is n't the size of the mill they care about , Paul , it 's the quality . They have n't got a unit where anybody does research like yours . " Paul 's lips twitched . He had not looked for anything so obvious from Bill who was , after all , pretty smooth after his years in Boston.  | " Well , I 'm not going to waste your time , " he said to Middleton . " The idea looks ridiculous to me , but what 's your offer ? I gather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bill think this up ? " He smiled at his brother . " Why  --  " William had no answer ready . " Oh  --  it was  --  just one of those things , " Middleton said , waving his hand . " Your brother and I have had a good many dealings in recent years , what with Laurence Gaylord 's estate and one thing or another . I 've been interested , naturally , in your mill here . It 's quite unique , after all . Those Navy projectiles you made , and that stuff I saw last summer . Quite unique . " " Well , are you making an offer now ? " Paul asked . " Oh , certainly . Now I understand that this is a partnership business . You  --  ah  --  have no stock , that is , you are unincorporated ? " " I know Bill has told you all the details , " Paul said easily . " You do n't have to feel your way , Mr. Middleton . We are a partnership business owned entirely by my brothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the basis of a straight sale , not an exchange of stock or anything of that sort . Bill has also doubtless told you what he thinks the companyis worth , and he 's probably right about that . What figure did he give you ? " Paul asked suddenly , in a sharp changed tone . He leaned forward . Middleton looked at William , who looked uneasily at Paul . " Why , " William said , looking uncomfortable , " I think I said about two and a half million , did n't I , Selden ? " " Three would be more exact , " Paul said , " but it does n't matter when you 're dealing with stuff like that . " He pointed again at Middleton 's memorandum . " In that case , " said Middleton , visibly making a mental revision of something he had decided before , " I would be instructed to offer you two and a half million in seven per cent cumulative preferred stock of the projected corporation , and a million and a half more in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at the ceiling . William looked at Paul . Paul gave no indication of surprise or any other marked reaction , but he did turn his head and stare for a minute at William . I bet he 's palpitating with eagerness , Paul said to himself . The silence lasted quite a long time . Then Middleton coughed and said , " Of course this is just a talking proposition so far , Mr. Scott . " " Of course , " agreed Paul . He was thinking of his father . If the Old Man were here now the glass would be rattling in the windowpanes and these two chaps would be scurrying around looking for their hats and overcoats . Paul almost laughed at the picture . He was also quite startled to find how calmly he really took this ; it must be because he had always expected something of the kind and he had learned long ago not to rush out and meet issues headlong . They caught up with you soon enough . " I do n't want to commit myself too far at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying , " but in general you could expect to realize the total book value of your company in preferred stock , and we would about match that in common . In other words  --  " " Not quite double our holdings , " Paul said . " Approximately . Of course it would depend on the condition of your property  --  " Middleton raised his eyes and looked doubtfully around the bare , ugly , dun-colored room as if it had anything to do with the mill 's capacity to make steel . " Of course , " Paul said again . Both men waited for him to say something more . William leaned forward and clasped his thin , perfectly groomed hands on the table before him . He wanted very much to get a real reaction from Paul . He wanted desperately for Middleton to pull this thing off successfully . He wanted beyond endurance the three quarters of a million or more in United States Steel stock that he would get out of this , and he could not conceive that Paul and all the others would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whether the mill lost its identity and Paul his life work had really never crossed William 's mind . He said finally , to break the silence , " How do you feel about it , Paul ? " Paul put his pipe carefully down , balancing it on the edge of the table . For one fleeting instant he looked at William with the full impact of scorn that this whole thing roused in him . Then he resumed his calm good nature and said , " Of course I could n't possibly give an answer now . For one thing , Mr. Middleton , since Bill told you so much else about the company , did he explain the stipulations of my father 's will in respect to partner-ships ? " " More or less . " " Then you understand that this sale could only be consummated through a two-thirds or majority vote of the five partners ? " " Yes . I understand that . " " And it would take a certain amount of time to call a meeting and poll the partners about this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a look of satisfaction . He was relieved at Paul 's calm reaction to this offer . He had feared that Paul might make a quick refusal and force him into taking legal action to bring the question to a vote . He murmured something about his gratification that Paul was being so open-minded about it . " Oh , you ca n't dismiss an offer to double your property , " Paul said . He said it so consideredly that for a minute William felt as if there must be some barb in the remark and he was not quick enough to perceive it . " So we will consider it very carefully , " Paul said , rising from his chair , " and that will take some time . We have a brother and sister in Europe . That takes time . And finally , there is the voting . " William and Selden Middleton exchanged a heavy look . Paul took out his watch . " It 's nearly seven , " he said . " We will just get home in time for dinner . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held it for him . " Why  --  er  --  " William said uncomfortably.  |p343Paul  turned to him with surprise . " You are n't staying somewhere else , surely ? I took it for granted you 'd stay with me . I can put you both up . " " That 's very kind of you , " Middleton said quickly . " As a matter of fact I am taking the night train to New York . I must be in Boston to-morrow . " " I have to take that train myself , " William said , a little too quickly . " I told Julia  --  " " Well , you have plenty of time for dinner , " Paul said casually . " The train does n't leave till nearly midnight . Jones must be waiting up at the gate . Come on . " William had hoped somehow to avoid this . He did not want in the very least to go to the house for dinner , or at all . He was afraid Paul might have Mary at the table . He really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's house , and he wanted to keep his distance . He did not want to be reminded of Louise 's ghastly suicide , which had taken place when he was abroad with Julia . He had been spared the funeral and any first-hand contact with that hideous thing : poor Louise with her unborn child lying with her head against the gaslogs in her bedroom  --  Mama 's bedroom . William had scowled and held Julia off when she tried to tell him what details she had learned . Terribly strange details  --  Louise had been found holding a picture of her father in one hand and an awful , incoherent letter to him in the other . " To her father , " Julia had said , pursing her mouth and shaking her head . " That man we met at your house  --  that very first time  --  dear , dear , is n't it too dreadful , William ? " It was . William really sufferedagonies in the carriage , driving up the hill . But he could not possibly have refused Paul 's hospitality without offending him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WILLIAM 'S FEARS WERE unfounded . He had to admit before dinner was over that not since his childhood had he known such calm , such warm , orderly comfort , and such a deeply contented atmosphere in his old home . Cheerful bright light gleamed from the front windows through red-ribboned Christmas wreaths as they walked up the front path . The Christmas tree still stood in the corner of the back parlor where the boys had found it loaded with presents the week before . Dick was waiting for his father at the front door and shook hands cordially with his uncle . He was tall for his age , and very handsome , with Louise 's warm coloring and curly brown hair . Only the four of them were at the table together ; when Bill inquired for the twins Paul said they would come in after dinner to say good night . William examined the dining-room with interest . Certain pleasant changes had been made . The flickering , hissing gas-jets had been replaced by the new Welsbach mantels . There was a large Persian rug on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The scratchy , slippery horsehair seats of the high-backed oak chairs were gone , and the chairs upholstered in corded red velvet . They ate with the old , massive chased family silver , but in addition to the ice water in the old Waterford goblets they drank an excellent Deidesheimer from thin , pale green Rhine wine glasses . The dinner was unexpectedly good too . William had to concede that the light , creamy cauliflower soup , the roast venison  --  " Joe Rogers shot it up at Ligonier , you remember him , do n't you , Bill ? "  --  the delicate potato dumplings , the rum souffle could not have been betteredin his own house . He looked at Paul with a new and almost a respectfulsort of interest . " I say , you have a first-class cook , " Selden Middleton said when Paul carved a second helping of venison for him . " I did n't know there were such cooks in Pittsburgh , " Bill said . " Oh , we get along , " Paul remarked with a laugh . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " William gazed about the room . " You 've kept the house up well , Paul , " he said . " I had an impression the Northside was going down . " " I 'm afraid that 's true , " Paul said . " It was dark when we came home so you could n't see much . The neighborhood is running down , no question about it . Too many boardinghouses and things . But I like it . I would n't think of moving . " " I should think you 'd be interested in Sewickley , " Bill said . " On account of the boys . There 's a very good school there , is n't there ? " " Yes , " Paul said , " but Allegheny was all right for us and it 'll have to do for them too . Wo n't it , Dick ? " " Good enough for me , " Dick said . " They 've got what I want at Prep . " " What is that ? " asked Middleton politely . " Math @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's interested in , " Paul explained with pride . " He 's going to Sheff , of course . " " Are you not going away to school before you go to Yale ? " asked Middleton . Paul saw that any boy of Dick 's age who did not go to Groton or Middlesex was incomprehensible to him . " I was planning to go to Andover , " Dick said . He colored slightly . " But since  --  I mean  --  now  --  I think I 'd rather stay home with Dad . " " Dick spends every Saturday morning with me at the mill , " Paul said . " He knows his way around very well . " " I 'm going to work there next summer if Dad will let me , " Dick said eagerly . " How old are you now ? " William asked . " Fifteen ? " " Nearly . I will be next month . " " Well , he 's too young , Paul . He ca n't work in the mill yet , can he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We were n't more than sixteen when Pa took us on , were we ? Lord , how you used to hate it ! "  |p345William  laughed rather shamefacedly . " I 'm afraid I did . I fear I was not cut out for an ironmaster . " " Dad was , " said Dick . It was a tactless remark , but made with such stout pride that they all smiled . They had coffee and brandy in the back parlor . Tommy and Teddy came in when they left the dining-room . William exclaimed with surprise when they appeared . " My word , Paul , " he said , " what are you raising , a houseful of giants ? " The twins were embarrassed . They were just as tall for their eleven years as Dick was for his age . But they had no other resemblance to one another at all . Tommy had a bush of straight , unruly hair , reddish enough in color to suggest a fleeting resemblance to Constance 's , but much darker . His face was thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his skull , very white skin heavily peppered with freckles , and restless green eyes . Teddy looked enough like Paul to be his miniature . Here were the broad brow and clear blue eyes and thick blond hair which Clarissa had given to Paul and to her granddaughter Clarrie ; the same dreamy expression and gentle  --  too gentle , for a boy  --  disposition . When they walked into the room together even a stranger like Middleton could see that Tommy made the decisions for both . Tommy took the lead , ordered Teddy about , imposedhis will on his brother . They were a striking sight , in spite of the lumpy clothes , the ugly black stockings , the clumsy shoes , and the chapped stained hands of small boyhood . Paul made the sort of conversation with them that fathers make when children come in to speak to company . He was not sorry when the mantel clock struck nine and Mary appeared in the doorway . " Come , boys , " she said . " Bed . " William looked up , rising involuntarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wore a gleaming , rustling dress of dark brown silk with a high collar edged with malines ruching . Her hair , twisted up in its severe high chignon , shone brilliantly in the white light from the Welsbach mantels . The emerald watch was pinned on her left shoulder . She smiled at William and came across the room holding out her hand . She was slen  --  erer than ever , very light and quick as she moved . " Hello , " she said cordially , " how are you ? " William noticed that she voided speaking his name . " Splendid , thank you . " Paul was introducing her to Middleton . She paused for a moment , chatting with William about Willy , whose engagement had just been announced ; she hoped he was happy ? And Angelica ? No , William laughed , she was quite fancy-free . Mary turned to the twins . " It 's past bedtime , boys , " she said . Her voice was low and full of authority . The boys said their good slights and went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his room to finish his homework . " Fine chaps you 've got there , " Middleton said , helping himself to brandy . William looked conspicuously at his watch . " Now about the matter we were discussing this afternoon , Mr. Scott  --  do you think you can give me some idea of the time element ? " " Well  --  " Paul pursed his lips . " Frankly , I do n't think I can comma myself on that just yet . But I wo n't make any unnecessary delays . I keep in touch with you right along . " Middleton nodded . William said , " That 's good . Well , Selden  --  " looked at his watch again . Making small talk , they moved to the hall to get their coats . Paul sa them out to the carriage . Neither man spoke until they were in the mid of the Sixth Street Bridge . Then Middleton turned suddenly to Willi and said , " Who is that striking woman in your brother 's house ? " William jumped . " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She 's my brother 's hou keeper . " And then , to his own amazement , and quite involuntarily wi pride in his voice , he said , " She 's been in our family nearly thirty years . Paul went back to the parlor and put another log of wood on fire . This open fireplace was an innovation precipitated by the tragedy Louise . Paul had always taken the gas fireplaces for granted . They we commonplace fixtures , familiar all his life . But after Louise 's death he w unable to look at gas logs or gas fireplace heaters without sickening . went through the house with a contractor and removed them from eve room . He wanted open fireplaces , but could not have many without rippi the place to pieces to rebuild all the chimneys . So he compromised wi bricking up most of the hearths and facing them with decorated tiles whi were much in style . But in the back parlor , because it was in an ell at rear of the house , he was able to build a real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it Mary refurnished the room . Paul still clung to father 's old sofa , but now the room contained two brown leather mo chairs , a large , practical desk , a new dark green carpet , a pleasant neut wallpaper , and curtains of heavy English crewel linen . Paul dropped in a morris chair by the fire and lay back with his pipe . Presently Mary came in with her sewing and sat down opposite hi She chose a straight chair with low arms ; it was comfortable for sewi and it stood beside a table in good light . She poked in a small tin box f shirt-buttons , threaded her needle and set to work on the twins ' cloth She knew that presently Paul would begin to talk and tell her what h brought William and the Boston financier to Pittsburgh . Before he was halfway through his story Mary forgot all about mending and sat stiffly on the edge of her chair , with her eyes fixed on face . Most of the time she had an expression of incredulous protest . Wh he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment , threw her head in the air and sniffed . " That 's the most preposterous poppycock I ever heard of , " she salPaul burst out laughing . " Poppycock ! A billion dollars ' worth ! T biggest financial brains in the country put together the biggest corporati in the world and you call it poppycock ! "  | " Well , that 's what it is to us . You surely do n't take this offer seriously ? " " Hold on , now . I do n't say I 'm going to snap it up , but I just tried toexplain what this means in money . It 's a lot of money , Mary . " " Yes , " she said acidly . " A lot of money . What will you do with threequarters of a million dollars ? Go and sun yourself on the Riviera ? Whatare the boys supposed to do ? Grow up and ask Mr. Carnegie for jobs ? " Paul 's lips twitched . " Why not ? Somebody might even give me a job . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Are you out of yourmind ? What 's William said to you , the blatherskite ! " Paul stretched his arms over his head and chuckled . " I never knew you were such a mark , " he said . " Go on and give me some more hell . " She blushed suddenly . With a sheepish expression , she sat down . Paullaughed . Then he said , " No , the question simply is how to go about thiswith the least amount of uproar . You know there 'll be a showdown . " " I do n't see why . William and Elizabeth vote for the sale and you andConstance and Edgar vote against it . Where 's the uproar in that ? " " What makes you so positive Ed and Con will both vote with me ? " " Why  --  they  --  because  --  Why Paul , they 're with us  --  that 's all . Theybelong to us . " " Three quarters of a million in cash or the equivalent can have a very surprising influence on people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sale , but "  --  Paul spoke more slowly and sucked hard on his pipe  --  " I 'm not so sure about Con . " " I 'm amazed at you . Constance has no use for William . Or leave him out of it and think of her going in on anything with Lizzie . It 's pre-posterous . " " Maybe so , " Paul said . " But I have a strange feeling about this , Mary . f anything about Con would be preposterous it would be her turning downchance to realize so much money . She would n't want to hurt me , I do n't say that , but money  --  well , you know how she burns it up . " Mary still looked incredulous . " What 's more , " Paul went on , " you must think of Con 's connections In London . That set she runs around with . Some of those fellows are the biggest money-brains in Europe . She 'll ask their advice about this , beyond ny doubt , and what do you think they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to jump at this offer if I were in their place and did n't have anyrsonal bias about the thing . " Mary shook her head . " I still think you 're underestimating her loyalty . " " My dear girl , loyalty has a saturation-point like everything else . This ai n't be put to Con in the light of her loyalty to me or of my differences ith Bill . It 's a business proposition and business "  --  Paul got up to stir e fire  --  " is business . " The five partners were informed of the offer simultaneously in a formal otification . All the notices went out so that they should be received on the me day . Edgar 's and Constance 's were dispatched on the fifteenth of January . Elizabeth 's and William 's were mailed on the twenty-first . All were asked either to come to Pittsburgh to cast their votes at a meeting at the mill on Friday , February the fifteenth , or to send their votes by mail or cable on or before that date , if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought William up in Boston , there was nothing to do but sit back and wait . He was sure of Lizzie . Certainly Constance with all her luxurious proclivities could not resist this offer . And even Paul , William had reason to believe , was so impressed with the chance almost to double his fortunate that he would find it irresistible . And if Paul wanted to go on making steel , the Scott mill or any other unit of the new corporation would offer him far more salary that he had ever paid himself . He must be seeing this as a magnificent opportunity . As for Edgar  --  he simply did not count in William 's calculations . Poor Edgar was an embarrassing encumbrancewhose vote in this matter could not make any difference , and whose existence in a Benedictine monastery was elaborately overlooked by the Episcopalian William Scotts and the Presbyterian Benjamin Nicholases , Mary doggedly refused to consider the possibility that Constance an Edgar would not automatically vote against the sale . But the more she encouraged herself in that attitude the more she remembered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was merely typical of his judicious mind t see all sides of the question . Then she began to defend her own blind fait in her twins against Paul 's realistic analysis . Finally she decided to wri to Constance . She knew that Paul would be angry if he found out that s had . If William were to find it out there might be an all-round explosioShe mailed her letter on the next ship after the one that had carri the notification to Constance . It was a brief letter , in which Mary too the bull by the horns and acknowledged the undeniable financial attra tiveness of the offer . But then she went on to point out what an irreparable catastrophe such a sale would be to Paul . She appealed to Constance i brief , sharp words which must impress themselves on her mind and her intense loyalties . Then , praying that her action would never be found out , she too sat back confidently to wait . She could not foresee what would be the circumstances of the dark twenty-fourth of January when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Square . To be sure , Mary and Paul the previous mornin had sat shaking their heads at the breakfast table over the black-headlin news of Queen Victoria 's death . It had been expected ; it touched them only through the cosmic sense of the passing era ; it dramatized the year . old new century in a way that no other event conceivably could . Thi towering symbol of majesty and permanence and power had dominat their concept of the foreign world ever since they were born . But only now in a sudden , incisively shocking way , did Mary sit up and realize that this had something to do with Constance , something Mary would not menti or speculate about or discuss even with Paul . She sat silent , breaking piece of toast to bits and mechanically watching to see that Tommy did n sugar his porridge too thickly , while Paul read the historic news aloud . She received Constance 's cable next day.  |p349HAVE  THOUGHT DESPERATELY STOP TERRIBLY AFRAID I SHALL HAVE TO VOTE FOR SALE AS I WILL NEED ALL POSSIBLE MONEY STOP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood in the front hall , reading the message over and over . At first she could not believe it ; she frowned and pored over it as if it were in a strange language . This could not be from Constance  --  Mary thought wildly for a moment that it was some kind of a hoax . Then she remembered Paul 's earnest warnings . She had simply not dreamed they could be true . She had thought to dispel any possibility of their being true by writing that letter to Constance . Perhaps that had been a mistake . She saw now that it could be a worse mistake to tell Paul about this , or to try to " reconcile " him . The loud striking of the grandfather clock made her realize that she must have stood here in the hall more than half an hour . She began to think quickly and furiously . She hurried to her desk , consulted the calendar , and counted off the days until the fifteenth of February . Twenty-one days . That should be plenty of time . Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She took the trolley-car over to Pittsburgh and spent the next two hours downtown . She did not dare weigh very carefully what she had decided to do . She had never deceived Paul in her life and if she thought too hard about that aspect of this matter she might not have the courage to go through with it now . But she felt determined , pushed on by desperation . Paul was not going to lose that mill . His very quietness , his stern reasonableness about all this , showed deeper feeling than all the protest and talk in the world . I f he were to have an inkling of Mary 's intentions he would forbid them categorically . That evening Mary told Paul that her sister Kate had had a bad fall and broken her leg . Kate 's eldest daughter , Ellen , was about to have her first child , and the two youngest of Kate 's own children were in bed with measles . ( God forgive me , Mary prayed wildly as she talked . Some of this was true and some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) " So I 'll have to go up to Johnstown tomorrow and stay until they 're all through this safely , " Mary said . She forced herself to look matter-offactlyat Paul . She hoped desperately that she was getting away with this . She must be , because Paul only looked concerned and said , " That 's too bad . If they need you I guess you 'll have to go . " " Oh , they need me badly . " " Well  --  how long do you think you 'll be ? " Mary gestured . " Why  --  a broken leg . You know  --  I suppose three weeks or a month at least . Before she can get about . " " I hope the boys will be all right , " Paul said doubtfully . Margaret had been dispensed with nearly two years ago . The twins were too old for a arse . " They 'll be all right , " Mary said reassuringly . " Trude can manage em . They 're at school most of the day anyway . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Dick and I 'll keep an eye on ' em as much as we can . But you 'll hurry back , Mary ? " " Why , of course , " she said . " Just as soon as I can . " Oh dear , she thought , I do hate telling lies . I 'm no good at it at all , at all . CONSTANCE MET HER at Waterloo . She was dressed entirely in dull black and looked subdued and pale almost to the point , had that been possible , of plainness . The streets as they drove through them were draped in black ; shopfronts and gateways were shrouded , and window-blinds uniformlyclosed . It was a depressing sight . " How long does this keep up ? " Mary asked curiously . " I never saw such a thing . " " Six weeks , " Constance said . " That 's the official period of court mourn-ing . " They spoke with unusual constraint . Mary had not been able to evok one natural exclamation or a spontaneous laugh from Constance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old Queen . Mary decid that Constance was really sick with guilty remorse for the stand she h taken or was about to take . She was relieved when they pulled up Cadogan Square and entered the house . Inside , behind the drawn curtains it was warm and cheerful with bright fires on the hearths , masses of ros and carnations everywhere , and a delicious tea waiting on the low tall by the fire in Constance 's boudoir . Constance ripped off her black cloth and flung them to her maid . " Phew ! " she exclaimed , stretching herself . She wore her usual exquisit hand-made lingerie rich with real lace , from which her pearly breasts an white shoulders rose like parts of a lush flower . She slid into the blue velv teagown her maid was holding . " Where is Clarrie ? " Mary asked eagerly . " Out , " said Constance . There was a strange note in her voice . " Out a music lesson . You may go , Hargrove . " She flung herself down on chaise longue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's in love . " " What ? " Mary 's face puckered with amazement . " Why , that 's ridiculous . " Constance shook her head . " No , it 's not . She 's eighteen , that seems child to you and me , but she 's deadly in earnest . " " You mean she wants to get married ? " " She is going to be married . " Mary leaned back and opened her mouth stupidly . " Why  --  I  --  why  --  " " I know , " said Constance wretchedly . " That 's the way I felt . ButP351ca n't oppose her . I ca n't make her unhappy . I want her life to be as lovely she is . " " Who is he ? " " A boy named Evan Gregory . He 's only twenty .

She met him at the Royal allege and I wish to God I 'd never let her go there . " " But , Constance . " Mary stirred her tea . " I just do n't understand . It 's sudden . You never wrote me about it . " " It only happened a month or so ago . I tell you , I was never so flabbergastedin my life . She came in one afternoon and sat down here and just k1 , ' Mummie , I 've fallen in love . ' And the worst of it is I knew damnshe meant it . " Constance blew a thin trail of smoke . " You know him  --  of course  --  " " Of course . He 's here all the time . I 'm not going to break that child 's frt . " " You were only seventeen when you were married , " Mary said slowly . y the way , what does Giles say about it ? " " How in hell should I know ? " Constance shrugged . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the millionaire the creditors sold Melling to . at has he to do with this ? " Mary gestured . " Nothing . Only  --  " " Only I 'm Clarrie 's father as well as mother . Here she is about to marry arming pauper and what do you suppose they 'll live on ? Me . " Mary raised her eyebrows . " So that 's why you need more money . " " That  --  and the other thing . I 've not really thought for years where thing came from . I 've always had what I wanted and done as I pleased now  --  well , it ca n't be the same . You see that . Oh God , Mary , let 's not about it now . " Constance ruffled her hair nervously . She stared att y and her green eyes lighted on the emerald watch . " Come over here d show it to me , " she said . " I 've never seen it . " She unpinned the watch from Mary 's dress and examined it with the ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taste , " she said finally . " I 'm not I 'd have thought it of him . Oh , here comes Clarrie . Let her tell you It Evan herself . " But Clarrie , as she hurried in , pink-cheeked from the cold air , with her uk hair curling delicately under her black hat , flung her arms about v ecstatically and dropped to her knees beside the chair . She looked t Iv at her mother and then back at Mary. dummie 's told you ! " she exclaimed . " Oh , Auntie Mary , is n't it too I ' Irrful ? And is n't she the most perfect , understanding , darling mother world ? " ry smiled at her . It was impossible to grasp all at once the change rrie . Hair up , yes , and long skirts ; a tiny , trim , curving figure in of the up-and-down young girl ; physically one would expect such s . But there was a far profounder difference in Clarrie . It was all ible , all in the expression of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice ; even her hands , clasped on Mary 's knee , small and square ; blunt-fingered in queer contrast to her delicate wrists , bespoke intent and purpose . Mary tried for two days to pin Constance down for a talk about mill . In childhood Constance had been diabolically clever about evading issues which she dreaded to face . Mary saw she had not lost that tale She gave unnecessary attention to trivial and passing things , but if a sensed that Mary was making or grasping an opportunity for a serious ti she flitted off , actually or mentally , about some concern of her own . was hugely demonstrative , more than ever before . She expressed mini concern for Mary 's comfort , critically inspected her room , sent up fresh flowers and bowls of fruit every day , and showered Mary with hugs a kisses at every encounter . They could not go out to the theatre or ma any kind of public appearance because of the court mourning . The weathy was too vile even to permit a daily walk or drive , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was now the fifth of February and if Constance 's answer were to by mail it must be sent on the ship sailing tomorrow  --  only twenty-f hours off . At that , it could only be delivered in Pittsburgh the night of fourteenth or the morning of the fifteenth . While dressing for dinner pondered what to do . She must have it out with Constance tonight . home it had seemed as if there were plenty of time to bring Constance round ; here it looked too late already . Evan Gregory came to dinner and the four of them sat in state in candlelight , with the butler and the footman circling the table serving of the superb dinners that were almost as much a part of the Constance legend as her wicked speech or her red hair . For Mary , and for Clare who was too meltingly in love to eat a mouthful , and for Evan who had tear his gaze from Clarrie to notice anybody or anything , the whole gasp nomic ritual was a ridiculous ordeal . Constance , in a black velvet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the table critically attentive I judicious as perfect soles followed perfect turtle soup , a garnished filet buttery red beef followed the soles , artichokes from the South of France followed that , a huge pate en croute appeared with the salad , and a fr bombe masked in golden spun sugar brought  --  Mary hoped  --  the fo dable meal to a close . But no , there was the savory to cope with , pep devilled mushrooms on thrones of toast . There was sherry with the s Meursault with the fish , Richebourg with the beef , and Mary actu shuddered when Constance , helping herself to the sweet , said " Champ Radford . The Cordon Rouge . " So she had not ordered that beforehand . Mary realized now that this profusion of luxurious food and wine , these great decorated ters which  --  but for Constance herself  --  went back to the kitchen b touched , this incredibly wasteful display was , although quite the u procedure in this house , intentionally mounted tonight for Constan purposes . It was a way of saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enormous amounts of money . I must have it . Look around and see wp353se . " Whether there might be any alternative would never have crossed stance 's mind . Not so long as she wished to live like this . She watched ly while the butler filled the champagne glasses and when Mary raised tiger to refuse , Constance shook her head . " No , " she said , " you must . I insist . I want to drink a toast . " She raised her glass and looked from Evan on her right to Clarrie at other end of the table . " To you both , " she said . " You darlings . I want you to be happy . " Mary had to join in that , with all her heart . " Coffee in the music room , " said Constance , rising . " Very good , m'Lady . " " So the children can play for us , " Constance said , slipping her arm ugh Mary 's . That sounded insincere in a way , but it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to play , Mary knew ; she also saw it was best way to put off conversation . To hear Constance mention " the dren " in that tone almost made Mary laugh out loud . It was half-act , - genuine ; and it was certainly no wool over Mary 's eyes . She kept marvelling at the change in Clarrie . Only three and a half t s ago she had been all child  --  serious and poised and sensible , but t l s enough to grow wide-eyed over the treats she was allowed . Mary I ver been able clearly to follow Constance 's reasoning , if any , in herfor Clarrie . She was being prepared for such a debut as any Earl 's n , liter should make , yet she was allowed to bury herself as deeply asfished in the music which was the greatest possible contrast to all that . should have been the year of her debut and her presentation , but nowwould be no Courts because of mourning . And Clarrie , turning with her relief to ever more serious study , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love . Her expression when she looked at Evan Gregory was of a wise and intensely absorbed woman . There was nothing childish t it . She seated herself at the piano and looked up at Evan , standing beside , with silent inquiry . He smiled . Mary watched the two of them with sudden pressing realization that she wanted to cry . This boy was as ut i f ul in his way as Clarrie  --  tall and firmly built , dark of hair , with warmly colored skin and deep gray eyes . Like Clarrie he was quiet , constantlyrelaxed in manner , yet fundamentally intense. is voice was all Constance had said . It was a full , ringing baritonea luminous poetic color which shone through every phrase of the songs  --  English songs with words by Ben Jonson and Shelley and Shakespeare , which Mary could enjoy utterly . She had supposed he wouldin German or Italian , and after a time he did sing some songs from Winterreise . Clarrie played magnificently . She was a polished artist , I Mary , knowing nothing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Clarrie as she played . There was an authority the very set of her shoulders , bent slightly forward over the keyboard . 1 ' 1 er about an hour Mary began to look uneasily at Constance . It was ot , late . Evan and Clarrie must be tired of singing and playing . Constance had been urging them on , begging Evan for this or that until it was all too clear that she had some ulterior motive in stringing the evening of Mary knew that the young people were wishing desperately to be l alone . She saw that Evan would only be able to bring the concert to close by making his goodnights . Constance would then take both Clar and Mary upstairs and contrive to keep them together with her , to fob stall being left alone with Mary . Mary chose the end of the next song rise from her chair and stare meaningly at Constance . She said , " do n't we go upstairs now ; I have some things I brought from home show you . " Constance stared back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggestion , but Evan was too quick . He had moved cou ously from the piano as soon as Mary rose , and was waiting to open door for her and Constance . There was nothing to do but leave the r Constance paused to kiss Clarrie and shake a playful warning finger Evan . " Do n't stay down here too late , " she said . She swept from the r her black velvet train swishing behind her . Mary followed . She felt ex  --  as if this were twenty years ago ; as if Constance , banished from the p for some typical misdemeanor , had been set upstairs in her custody . stance swished into her boudoir and Mary followed and closed the d Constance flung herself peevishly into a chair and said , " Well ! I do you 're turning highhanded . What is this , anyway ? " Mary stood on the hearthrug . " This is , " she said coldly , " the reason I came over here to see I 've been here forty-eight precious hours waiting for a chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me every minute . You kno well as I do you must mail your ballot tomorrow and I want to know it is going to say . " Constance sighed . " Did n't I wire you ? Have n't I explained ? Ca n't see the situation ? Must we stage a drama about it ? " " Apparently , " said Mary , " we 'll have to . I 'd prefer to talk it quietly but if you 're going to take this attitude then I suppose we 'll it out . First of all , I ca n't believe you 'd do anything so contrary to own nature , Constance . You 've always been greedy , but not to the of harming anybody else . " " Why does this have to be a damned moral issue ? Why am I brother 's keeper ? You 're such a sentimentalist , Mary , and so full of t holy ideals about loyalty and duty and all that  --  you ca n't unders business is business . " " I understand a good deal more about business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how much good money wasted on that disgusting dinner tonight ? " " Well , I 'll be damned . " Constance glared up at Mary . " I 'm not impressed by the famous , dazzling Lady Melling , if what you mean . " Constance 's nostrils swelled . For a moment she looked furiously Mary ; then with one of her sudden unpredictable flashes she burst laughing .   " Oh , the hell with it , " she said . " We 're doing our best to work up to a second-act curtain and it 's perfectly absurd . " " Certainly it 's absurd . This is a dreadfully serious thing , and I 'm frank tell you I 'm nearly desperate . I want to save the mill for Paul . " She rated forward and fixed her tear-filled eyes on Constance . " Ca n't you realize what this means  --  do n't you know ? " Her voice broke . Constance sat pulling a rose to bits . Her scarlet lips were tightly pursed . e did not answer at once . Finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you ow that perfectly well . My God , you know that 's what 's been driving crazy . You do n't think I like being in this position ? " " Then what  --  why  --  " " Look . " Constance sat up and reached for a memo pad and pencil . ust come and sit down here and let me show you . My share in the mill now worth I understand about four hundred thousand dollars . " She an jotting down figures . " And that 's a good substantial increase since your father died , " Mary kl . " Your income has increased steadily the past five years or so , m't it ? " " Yes . It averages perhaps eighteen thousand dollars a year now . Someesmore , sometimes less . That 's one thing about this that bothers me . Dt having a fixed dividend rate . Paul just pays us out our share of the t profits at whatever rate he thinks best . So we ca n't tell from one year the next what the income will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so you ought n't to be bothered knit the difference over and above the minimum you know you 'll get . " " ' That 's what you think . But you do n't realize how much money I need . by Mary , you do n't think I could live on eighteen thousand dollars a Nr  --  a bit over three thousand pounds ? Do n't be a child . " " You could if you wanted to . " " But I do n't want to ! " Constance flared . " I 'm damned if I will . Why ttId I ? " Mary bit her lip . She had a scorching answer ready but thought better It . She only said mildly , " Lots of people do . " Constance shrugged . " Oh , if you 're going to talk rot there 's no use  --  ussing the thing with you . I am not lots of people ' and I 've no intention king . If you 'll get that through your head once for all I 'll go on explainmyside of this to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always had lots of money over and above what Paul sent from mill . You understand that . " " I wish I did n't , " Mary said acidly . " Well , the point is , I 've had it . And it  --  ah , I  --  I sha n't have it any . In fact it will be quite out of the question . The Queen 's death and  --  the devil . I 'm not going into the details with you . I never have . They 're  --  of your damn business . " Constance was charming about that , not ' lent . She picked up her pencil again and went back to her figures . " You see , " she said , " all in all I 've had about as much again as Paul l me . Between six and seven thousand pounds a year altogether . "  | " From which you did not buy jewels , furs , wines and sundries . " " From which I most certainly did not . But I 've spent every cent I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the future as it has in the p Particularly with Clarrie and Evan to support . " There was a long silence . At last Mary said , " Did it ever occur to y. that you might change your style of living ? You could live a great d more simply and still roll in luxury . " " Of course it occurred to me , " Constance answered , " and if I recoil . correctly , we talked about that the last time you were here . Mary , do n't really think I 'm a heedless , improvident fool , do you ? You know better than that . Some day I 'll get bored to death with all this and th I 'll do something else . In fact some day I 'll probably find it smarter leave London . Any day , perhaps . " " But you would still want piles of money badly enough to get it breaking Paul 's heart ? " Constance flushed . " Is n't that a bit thick ? After all , Paul would get much money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Paul does n't want money , " Mary said bitterly . " Paul only wants mill .

Why , this new Steel Corporation would snap him up  --  make him t head of all their invention or whatever you call it  --  they 'd pay him h dreds of thousands of dollars instead of the fool pittance he pays himself " And take all the meaning out of life for him . " Constance 's finger moved slowly forward and tilted Mary 's chin . " Why is that all the meaning life has for him ? " she asked in a 1 . voice . " You know the answer to that .

I 'd have perhaps thirty to thirt five thousand dollars a year in dividends  --  in other words , about the sa as I 've had up to now . Now I ask you , Mary , how can I refuse ?

But he 'll be so much better off  --  s he gets over  --  the  --  " " The heartbreak , " Mary said cruelly . " You have n't got the courage to it it . " Constance began to cry . " Oh , you 're devilling me so , " she sobbed . by does this have to be all tangled up with the people I love ? Why ' t it just be business ? It 's only dollars and cents , after all . " " Only dollars and cents , " Mary repeated angrily . " I 'd like your father hear you say that . I wish he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - and the family  --  " " Oh Jesus ! " Constance cried sharply . She was seldom as profane as I " There you go : off on your horse again . The family ! That God damn ily . Has n't it messed up your life and Paul 's life enough  --  without g it as a club over me ? " " I 'm disgusted with you , " Mary said coldly . " You 're no better than ham and Lizzie . You make a mockery out of all the things your mother father brought you up to be . You do n't understand the mill any better n William . You do n't see that the mill and the family are all the same . in one and you ruin the other . You 'd just as soon . " Constance kept on filing and mopping her eyes like a child . " I thought you were one of " Mary said bitterly . " Paul and Edgar . And me . " " I am , " Constance sobbed into her handkerchief . " You know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better than you love us . " " Oh , you 're beastly to me ! How can you say such a thing ? " " Because I 'm afraid it 's true , " Mary said wretchedly . " I thought I 'd able to move you . I thought  --  you'd- " now Mary broke down in tears . " Do n't , " Constance clutched her arm . " I do n't want you to take on way . Please  --  " " flow can I help it ? The only thing I 've ever asked of you . The onlyI 've ever  --  admitted  --  what  --  Paul  --  " Again she choked her words Then she drew a long breath and asked , " Do you remember the letter wrote me three years ago ? On the anniversary ? " Constance nodded sadly . " ' Then where are you ? " Mary asked piteously . " What 's happened to ?  --  Constance was silent . " I do n't know what to do , " Mary breathed at last . " I just ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do . " " ' Phis is a hell of a situation , " Constance groaned . " To sit here holding balance and be torn in little pieces . If only somebody else would vote the damn thing then I would n't feel guilty of everything you accuse of . " " ' That 's so preposterous , " Mary said impatiently . " Who else but WilandLizzie would vote for it ? Certainly not Paul . Or Edgar . He 's probably sent his vote by mail long ago . " " Poor Eddie , " said Constance . " He 's so simple and ineffectual . " Before the words were out of Constance 's mouth Mary 's spine stiffened.  |p358Something  pricked at her mind , some idea , vague , distant , formless an idea . A feeling that Edgar might be the last resort which could mir lously influence Constance . He might appeal to some streak in her , so thing buried as deep as his own mysticism had been buried in the years fore misery brought it to the surface . Mary leaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without flinching . They stared honest clear and frank  --  but stubborn . " Will you do one thing for me ? " Mary asked in a low voice . " Pro me one thing ? " " What ? " " Do n't mail the ballot tomorrow . Plan to send your vote by cable time for the fifteenth . " " Why ? " " I ca n't exactly explain , " Mary said , " but I 've got to talk this with Edgar . I do n't know myself exactly what I 'm getting at . But I know I must talk to him before you vote . " " Well  --  " Constance shrugged . " I 'm not going to change my m Mary . I 've explained the basis of my decision  --  it 's flat cash  --  and yo explained everything you can . Nothing Ed can say will influence me el I 've gone through hell coming to this decision and now my mind 's up . " " But you will wait and cable your vote ? " Mary begged . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's any comfort to you . ' EDGAR SAT QUIETLY with his hands clasped before him on the oak t in the stone reception hall . The dark , vaulted chamber was cold wi deadly , penetrating chill . Though the winter sun shone feebly outside , warmth could penetrate these massive walls . A small charcoal br burned in the corner . Mary had finally overcome her emotion at seeing him again . She been full of hesitancy and uncertainty during the painful moments waiting for Edgar to join her here after she was admitted to Monte sino . She had trembled all over when the low door in the wall opened he entered the hall and strode over , holding out his hands in the warm most natural kind of greeting . He was dressed in a long hooded habit coarse black cloth belted with a heavy leather girdle . A crucifix hung fr it . His feet were bare , shod in crude leather sandals , and his hands brown , hard , and stained and scarred from heavy work . He had Mary 's eyes go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he had said . " I am not tonsured yet . " He was still a lay brot but he was about to become a canonical novice . Mary was amazed atP359They had grown deep , warm , and profound in expression . The ined , haunted look , the tendency to stare anxiously , had completely ppeared . His face was as thin as ever , but neither drawn nor pale . ey had sat down here and Edgar had told her something of his life , of extreme contentment with it , of the early rising , the long , regular hours prayer , the reading and meditation , the ample , peaceful sleep , the hard , isfying work . He was in the forge where all metals used in the communitywere worked and repaired . The time of Mary 's visit was limited I she had had to begin then to tell him why she had come . She talked ile he listened attentively . " And , " she finished , " that 's where it standsEdgar raised his head and looked at her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his brow puckered as if the effort to throw hisd back into the mundane world of money and its struggles was painful . ry saw that he never thought in English any more . He pondered each nt that she made and sometimes asked to have it repeated . When she Hy finished , he sat quiet , staring at her . " I feel very sad about Con , " he said slowly . " I feel so sad , " Mary said , " that I 've come to ask you to do something . ything , Edgar  --  I have absolute faith there is something you can do . " Ile thought for a time . Of course , " he said quietly , " Paul must not lose the mill . " They looked deep into each other 's eyes . " I feel that way too , " Mary said . " I ask you not to let him lose it . " " You know of course what I can do , " he said . " Even if you had not tight it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall have to do it , if there no other way to influence Con . " " You mean you 'd  --  " Mary hesitated . " This is rather serious for me too , " Edgar said . " It is not strictly orable . It may be "  --  he bowed his head and crossed himself slowlyin . " Mary caught her breath . " Oh , why ? " she whispered. it is against the terms of Father 's will for any one of us to bring sure on any of the others to decide his vote in the event of a proposedIf I induce Constance to vote with Paul , that will be the first dishonest thing I do . There will be more , too  --  alas . " " But we are only trying to do what is right , " Mary pleaded . " It is it to keep the mill for Paul . It is right not to let mere greed for money it away from him . " " Who are you to decide what is right ? " Edgar asked slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pray , " Mary said earnestly . " I will pray and do penance all the of my life if this is sinful now . You too , you will pray . You are a holy now , Edgar . I can not feel you would do what is really wrong . " She used . " And there 's no time to lose , " she said in a panicky way . " Todaye seventh of February . The votes must be in Pittsburgh one week fromY.  |p36o  " Mine should be there already , " Edgar said . " I wrote the day I receiced the notice . There was not even a question of choice . " " Thank God . " " There is one reason aside from the great question of dishonesty , this is hard for me , " Edgar said slowly . Mary waited for him to explain . He thought for a time , and continued . " I had always intended when I was received into the Order to arr with Paul to buy my share in the mill . Under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is permitted to sell our share to Paul if we I wanted to take that money and give it to the Order . " Mary nodded slowly . " I am not surprised at that . It is a magnifi thing to do for the Church . " " Nothing compared with what the Church gives to me , " Edgar simply . " But I also thought of it as the proper way to terminate worldly existence , I wanted very much to do that , Mary . " " And now ? " " Now , of course , I shall have to give half my share to Constan Edgar said . He spoke quite matter-of-factly , as if he had thought this long ago . Actually it could only have occurred to him in the few mo since Mary had told him about Constance . He had thought at first , Mary , that Constance would automatically vote against the sale . Mary drew in her breath with a sharp gasp . This was what she felt , the elusive thought which would not take shape for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said , holding her handkerchief to her face , " You too good , too wonderful . " He shook his head slowly . " On the contrary , I fear I am doing something very wrong . It dreadful thing , a shocking , wicked thing to take money one had mean give to God and turn it over to Mammon  --  which is certainly Consta use for money . I should not make it possible for her to be more wo and spoiled than she is already . " " She wants some of the money for Clarrie , " Mary said weakly . " She and Clarrie could live good honorable lives with much less they have now , " Edgar said sternly . " No , frankly I am not thinking of Constance . I am thinking of Paul  --  and you . I did you a very wrong through your sister . I have never had a chance to expiate to you . This is my chance . You want Paul to keep the mill . He keep it . " Mary cried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have tried Paul sorely , and made his harder for him by leaving him to run the mill alone when he needed And also  --  " he paused , feeling for words . Mary realized again that he thinking in Italian , perhaps in Latin , certainly not in English . " I feel , " Edgar said slowly , " that this is the only thing I can do to help insure the continuity of the family . " He chose his words tho fully . " My being here out of the world  --  I know that has distressed But I see clearly from here , Mary . "  |p361He  leaned forward and smiled gravely . " I see , " he said , " what isvaluable in our family and what is not . What has given it identity and character , what helps it to keep those things . " He reflected . " The mill does at , " he said . Then there was a long pause . " And so do you . " The tears rose quickly to Mary 's eyes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't deserve that , " she said softly . " But it is true . You have held us to the best in ourselves  --  where we have been able to rise so high . I think in a way that is true of the mill too . should not like to contemplate a future for Paul and his sons  --  without r mill . " " Then you can not have any doubts about your method of saving it  --  r them ! " " There is no time to ponder that now , " Edgar said . " I shall go into treat as soon as you leave , and talk about it with my confessor . Now we just act . If you would not mind waiting here , Mary , while I go and get rmission to go to Rome  --  " " What are we going to do ? " Mary asked . " We are going to the American consul , to get his help in drawing up a of gift . Father 's will , " Edgar said slowly , with a look in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of long ago , " Father 's will id nothing about any heir 's giving his share or any part thereof away . he restrictions were all about selling the shares . " " You are wonderful , " Mary said again . " You will take this deed , dated some time after February fifteenth , k to London , and tell Constance I offer her the gift of half my share she will vote against the sale . This will give her a total holding about ual in value to the amount of steel stock she would receive if the sale re made . If she accepts my offer , see that she cables her vote at once . she refuses it destroy the deed , or return it to me . " " God bless you , Edgar , " Mary said , wiping her eyes . " I shall pray most earnestly for Him to do so , " Edgar said , " and OurBlessed Lady also . I fear I am committing several grave sins . " " You are saving  --  the dearest thing  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table and buried her head in her arms as Edgar went away and posed the small door in the wall . The meeting was scheduled for three o'clock on the afternoon of February fifteenth . William was to arrive in Pittsburgh at noon and Paul t Jones to meet him at the station and take him to the Duquesne Club lunch . Paul joined him there . Elizabeth had been supposed to come with Bill , but she had wired the previous evening that she was not well , d that William was bringing her vote with him . " What 's the matter with her ? " Paul asked over the pepperpot soup . He was not so much concerned as making family conversation . Bill looked uncomfortable . " Why  --  ah  --  to tell you the truth , Paul , " he blurted , " I do n't quite ow how to put it . "  | Paul laid down his spoon . " What 's the matter ? Is she seriously ill ? " He thought quickly of . mother . " No . " William coughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she ah  --  er  --  really you ca n't imagine it , " he said . " What is it ? " " She 's "  --  Bill turned a dull red  --  " going to have a child . " Paul 's mouth dropped open . " Go on . You 're kidding . " Now that it was out , Bill laughed . " No I 'm not . Ben told me about yesterday . It 's no mistake . " " Well I 'll be damned . How old is Lizzie , anyway ?  --  why Lord , she forty-two years old ! " " I know . It 's almost unbelievable . Like Sarah in the Bible . " " Why , it 'll kill her , " Paul said . " I understand it is rather  --  dangerous for a woman her age . Who ne had any children . " Paul sat shaking his head and buttering a roll . " Bible is right , " he said . " The barren fig tree or something . It gi me the creeps . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , changing the subject abruptly . " I guess so . Harry 's put a letter from Monte Cassino in the safe at mill , and a cable which I suppose is from Con . You 've got Lizzie 's v  --  with you  --  and here we are . " " Here we are , " agreed Bill . " Who else will be at the meeting ? " " Just Harry Wilkins , " - this was Paul 's lawyer , old Henry Wilki son . " And one of his clerks . And two men from the bank . Just as w Middleton decided not to come  --  there was no real reason . " " I suppose not , " William said . He seemed about to say something el then to think better of it . Paul was signing the check . " Well , if you 're ready , Bill  --  " They chatted desultorily in the carriage driving over to the mill . W Liam still seemed to have something to say which he was holding W. Probably making plans for transferring the assets of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men were already seated around the conference table in outer office when the brothers arrived . They all rose and there was gen handshaking . Nobody had ever seen William Scott in such an affable , c  --  fident mood in these surroundings . Paul motioned Bill and the bankers chairs and walked over to the safe with Harry Wilkins . They opened and took out a heavy manila envelope with thick wax seals . For the record , Wilkins read aloud a copy of the offer from the p jected United States Steel Corporation , as transmitted to the five partn of the Scott Iron Works . He then read the portion of old William Scot will covering the questions of any sale of the Scott Iron Works orpartnership thereof . Paul gazed out of the window during the reading , eyes resting on the bridge stretching from the street to the front entra of the mill . Even today the strong will of his father , expressed in thp363hard legal words , had the power to hold his closest attention . There was something so immediate about the Old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were here in the room . Burning with scorn , too . " Now , " said Harry Wilkins , " we are ready to open the votes . Is there any preference as to the order in which we read them ? " Paul listened in complete detachment . He could not feel as if the mill were at stake , though it was still perfectly possible that five minutes from now he might find the whole thing gone , finished , done . He tried to believe that , but he knew perfectly well he was fooling himself . He had had his had and hopeless moments , but they were over now . He felt completely calm . Bill was leaning back in his chair with a comfortable smile . " Why not open them in the order they arrived ? " he suggested . Everybody nodded . Wilkins picked up the letter with the Italian stamp . " This came first , did n't it , Paul ? " He slit open the envelope and extracted one thin sheet written in Edgar 's and , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mark . " Edgar Scott , lay brother of the Order of Saint Benedict , Monte Casino , Province of Lazio , Rome , Italy , votes against sale of the Scott Iron ' Works to the projected United States Steel Corporation , " Wilkins read . everybody took that for granted . Wilkins laid down the ballot in the renter of the table . " Signature of Edgar Scott duly attested , " he said . Next he picked up the cable , Constance 's cable , they all knew . William still sat smiling a little and quite expansive . He knew what this would say . Paul smoked his pipe , perfectly impassive . Wilkins opened the cable . " I cast my vote , " he read aloud , " against sale of Scott Iron Works to projected United States Steel Corporation . Stop . Ballot duly signed witnessedposted London February eleventh nineteen one . Signed Constance , Countess of Melling , born Constance Scott . " William leaned forward , frowning . " What ? " he asked , as if he had not heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Wilkins handed Constance 's cable to William , who read it , his pale gray eyes oil wing slowly along the lines . He moistened his lips and laughed a little . " Rather a surprise , is n't it , Paul ? " he asked in an artificially easy tone . " Very much so , " said Paul . " What 's the next ballot , Elizabeth 's ? " Wilkins picked up the sealed envelope addressed in Elizabeth 's handriting . " Elizabeth Scott Nicholas of Thirty-six East Thirty-seventh Street , City and County of New York , State of New York , votes to sell the Scott lien Works to the projected United States Steel Corporation on the terms stated in the notification of January fifteenth . Signature of Elizabeth Scottin bolas duly attested . " William looked relieved . It made a difference in the atmosphere for e positive votes to appear now . He was really glad that the twins ' ballots . re opened and finished with ; from now on it would be straight sailing . s own ballot lay next on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so sure of Paul that he had urged Selden Middleton to feel out the men wh were putting the Corporation together , concerning a highly-paid executive post in one of the Pittsburgh mills for Paul .

Signature of William Campbell Scott duly attested . " There was no comment . Paul 's ballot lay alone on the table in its seals envelope . William was smiling outrightly now ; palpably congratulating himself and Paul . The envelope crackled as Wilkins slit it open . He real aloud in his sharp Pittsburgh voice . " Paul Scott of I203 Western Avenue , City and County of Alleghen Commonwealth of Pennsylvania , votes against sale of Scott Iron Works to the projected  --  " The rest of his words were drowned in the long , hoarse gasp that catty from William . All the men turned their heads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . William recovered his poise aq leaned forward , clutching the table with his long , veined hands . " There must be some mistake , " he said . Nobody answered . " Some mistake , " he repeated . " Is there not , Paul ? " Wilkins said , " I had better read the last ballot aloud again . " He didWilliam was half out of his chair as Harry Wilkins laid down paper ; he leaned over the table towards Paul , with his pale face worki For one awful moment Paul remembered the last such meeting in t room , the meeting where the Old Man had bought out Gaylord and broken with Bill . Paul was afraid there would be an outburst from William nod But his brother was too old for that ; too mortified in the presence of the witnesses . He was , however , inarticulate with outrage . He stared at Pa while Wilkins and his clerk and the men from the bank self-consciou shuffled papers , lit cigars , blew their noses , and tried to look the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table . " You 've tricked me , " he said at last , half aloud . " I might have kno you 'd do such a thing . " Paul shook his head gravely . " I beg your pardon , Bill , I have not tricked you in the least . " " You let me think you 'd vote for this sale ! What is that if not deceit " I did not let you think so . I never said one word , " Paul replied . " But  --  but  --  why did you let me take it for granted you 'd sell ? Ydid do that ! " His voice was thick with anger . " I ca n't help it if that 's the way you interpreted my attitude . I trying to be fair and impartial in respect to everybody else , but if y seriously thought I 'd vote to sell this mill you are unrealistic , that 's You ought to have known me better . " " I know you , " William said bitterly . " I know you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He reached out and seized the pile of ballots with Constance 's cableP365long them He ruffled through them , his narrow gray eyes flicking across ch one as if he expected to find something he had not known before . He took the cable and slapped it down on the table in front of Paul . " How about that ? " he asked furiously . " There 's something queer there I know you and that  --  that  --  " he paused , seeking an epithet for Con : rice . Paul had to restrain a smile . When Bill approved of Constance he as only too pleased to be the brother of a Countess Why did she cable ? ' illiam snapped . " What 's she been up to ? If she 'd voted honestly she 'd have mailed her ballot in proper time the way Edgar did . At least he 's honst. if he is a poor deluded fool . " You know Constance as well as I do , " Paul said coldly . " You see . ore of her than I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " As he spoke , he w in a sudden shocking flash who had been in London and what had ! opened there . He felt shaken and weak . Now his composure was entirely rt ificial and his voice harsh as he turned to Wilkins and asked , " Would you say Lady Melling attended to her correspondence and business regularly , Harry ? Or promptly ? Have you ever had a signed receipt or other ocument from her on time ? " " Never , " said Wilkins . There was a long silence . The men around the table stirred uncomortably ; the meeting should be dismissed ; there could be nothing more discuss . But just as Paul was about to rise and break up the gathering illiam said , " You 'll regret this to your dying day . This Corporation will t something in place of your piddling mill and crush you out of existence . " " I 'll be expecting that , " Paul said . " Well , you need n't have dragged the rest of us down with you ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've made out , I think . Incidentally , Bill  --  " The men all looked up expectantly . They sensed what Paul was about say . William sat glaring at the table. " .  --  any time you are dissatisfied with my management , " Paul continued , " I 'll be glad to buy you out . " " I 'm sure you 'd be , " William answered with hate . " I 've no intention selling  --  to you . " Paul exchanged a glance with Harry Wilkins , who stood up with palblerelief . " This concludes the business before the meeting , I believe , " said . Paul stood at the head of the table while the men gathered their hats d overcoats and filed out . William was in a hurry to get away . He had ickly accepted Wilkins ' invitation to drive him to the station . " You wo n't come up for dinner , Bill ? " Paul asked . He had been undecided whether this was wise or foolhardy . After all , Bill might come . ButIs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I hardly think we 'd have ything  --  congenial to talk about " He said good-bye abruptly and folwedHarry Wilkins out When the last of the men had gone Paul went to his private office and shut the door . He sank slowly into his swivel air , and putting his hand to his forehead , was surprised to find it damp . " Whew ! " he said slowly . " Oh  --  Mary . Oh , my God . " He leaned hisbows on the desk and dropped his head on them . " Oh , Mary , " he
