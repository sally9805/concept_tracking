txt The Senate approved today , with slight changes , the House bill to raise the national debt limit to $65,000,000,000 , a ceiling which , according to Administration spokesmen , will suffice until June 30 , 1942 , at least . There was no record vote and no dissenting voice was heard when the question was put , but in debate doubt was expressed that the authorized borrowing power would be enough for the Treasury to finance the lease-lend bill 's operations , on top of other government expenses . Senator Prentiss M. Brown of Michigan , floor manager for the bill , explained that the present debt limit is $53,000,000,000 , instead of $49,000,000,000 , as supposed . The $4,000,000,000 increase came from wartime authority given to the Postmaster General to issue war savings stamps , according to Mr. Brown . The present measure would repeal that power and place an overall limit of $65,000,000,000 on the indebtedness which the Treasury might contract . Senator Brown discussed the possibility of seeking other sources of revenue by the Federal Governlment , including a general sales tax , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am not advocating it , " he told the Senate in speaking of the sales I tax , " but we will have to reach into forms of taxes that are not entirely just . It is the last tax I would like to levy , but we may have to levy a tax that is theoretically unjustifiable . " Critics of the Administration 's fiscal policy contended , in effect , that the Secretary of the Treasury failed to take into account not only the implications of the lease-lend bill but deficiency items of more than $2,000,000,000 for which requests have been sent to Congress . The general trend of their remarks was that , much to their regret , the proposed debt limit would be exceeded well before June 30 , 1942 . They saw insufficient margin between the $58,000,000,000 , which Secretary Morgenthau predicts as the outstanding debt on that date , and the proposed limit , because of the unpredictable deficiency requests and the commitments which will be made under the lease-lend bill , likewise of unknown scope . Senator Byrd of Virginia , champion of governmental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He expressed approval of the bill 's provision to subject the income from future Federal bonds to taxation . By counting contingent liabilities of the Federal Government Mr. Byrd said the Federal debt would amount to $100,000,000,000 by July 1 , 1943 , and that to this should be added about $20,000,000,000 of debts by States , counties and municipalities in computing the total national debt . " If we can see ahead of us in the immediate future a $100,000,000,000 debt , " he asked , " what is to prevent a debt of $125,000,000,000 , or $150,000,000,000 , unless determined and forceful means are taken to prevent such a catastrophe ? I know , of course , that no one can say with definite finality ? that a debt of $100,000,000,000 jeopardizes the credit of America . " Yet an evidence of the rapid growth of the per capita debt of all governments , local , State and na. tional , is that in 1929 the per capita debt was $277 . When appropriations now made are expended , it will be $700 per capita . This means that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of $2,800 . " Remarking that " planned economy has meant so far plans to spend more government money , " Mr. Byrd estimated that Federal , State and local governments will absorb , in taxes , 20 per cent of the national income in the present fiscal year . " We are barely collecting today , notwithstanding very large increases in tax , " he said , " a sum sufficient to pay for the non-defense expenditures only . The socalled peacetime expenditures may be estimated at $8,000,000,000 , while the revenue for the next year , under the imposition of new and increased taxes , will be approximately $8,200,000,000 . " So , until non-defense spending is reduced , we face the dilemma of adding every dollar for national defense and every dollar of aid to Great Britain and other countries to the national debt . " Mr. Byrd offered a resolution to set up a joint commission of six Senators and six Representatives to make recommendations to Congress , after study , on the following topics : 1 . A consideration and study of the financial post-war problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 . A revision of the Federal tax system . Senator Taft estimated that the proposed aid to foreign countries will cost $5,000,000,000 by July 1 , 1942 . By adding the estimated debt at the end of this year , deficiency requests already received , contingent liabilities in appropriations made but not expended by that date , and the estimated deficit , he reached a total of $70,800,000,000 . Despite these and other criticisms , no effort was made to expand the debt limit upward , and the Senate adopted the bill with only the three technical amendments which the Finance Committee had recommended . These will necessitate a reconsideration by the House , but it was believed that there would be no great difficulty , in reconciling the two versions .
