Interior decorators , both amateur and pro , have generally had to take what they could get from the designers of chairs , wallpaper and fabrics-and what they got was often unmistakably hideous . Last week the powerful American Institute of Decorators , out to put a little polite pressure on industry , awarded prizes to 1946 's best designs , and hoped that industry would take the hint . The decorators ' choices went on display in Chicago 's Art Institute . <P> The prizewinning furniture , which would probably raise no cheers in Grand Rapids , was a plywood table and chair with rod-thin , chrome-plated legs . They were designed by California 's solemn , earnest Charles Eames , 39 , onetime pupil of famed Finnish modernist Eliel Saarinen . Eames , who designed molded plywood splints for the Navy during the war , is a man who believes that utility is beauty 's only garment . He finds the kitchen and bathroom the most beautiful rooms in most U.S. homes . By the same token , Designer Eames explains , " when a chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who made the year 's prize wallpaper was from Copenhagen . His winning design was a hand-blocked strip of black &; white leaves and flowers on a grey background . Judges also liked a busy strip of his , full of little men running like all get-out ( see cuts ) . Bent Karlby also designs houses to paste his wallpaper up in . During the war he redecorated a Danish resort hotel , from chandeliers to ashtrays . When comfort-loving Nazis took it over , Karlby hurried home to print an underground newspaper in his cellar . The Nazis almost caught him , but he escaped to Sweden in a fishing smack . There his wallpaper designs made an immediate hit . <P> The winning fabric was a simple crossbar pattern woven by San Francisco 's Designer Dorothy Liebes . She wove her winner with cotton , mohair and rayon . In other designs , she sometimes blends silk , bamboo reeds , lucite and copper wire into her fabrics . Every summer Mrs. Liebes disconnects her phone for two months , returns to the trade in the fall with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Among her present projects : designing stage curtains for prefab theaters that Henry Kaiser plans to ship abroad , working up fabrics to redecorate Matson luxury liners , for Consolidated Vultee 's new 2O4-passenger airplanes , and for 1948 Ford and General Motors cars .
