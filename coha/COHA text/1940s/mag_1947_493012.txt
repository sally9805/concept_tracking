WHAT WE FOUGHT FOR THE Evil . that men do lives after them , " quotes Lewis H. Brown , the author of A Report on Germany ( Farrar , Straus ; $3 ) , referring to Hitler 's trapped-gangster death in the wreckage of Berlin . Then , with the consummate skill of a soap-opera ad writer , he throws in a non-sequitur punch line : Likewise , the mistakes that men make in war and politics in combating the evil aggressor live after them . . .. We as Americans should be the first to recognize the great political mistakes made by our own leader Roosevelt ) . These mistakes live on today . . . . But there was one master mistake . That was made in 1943 , when it was decided to send an Anglo-American army into Italy instead of Yugoslavia . . .. Because we sent no army into Yugoslavia in 1943 , the Soviet is today in Budapest , Vienna , Warsaw , Berlin , and within 100 miles of the Rhine . This picture of Soviet armies sitting menacingly within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the book , always with great rhetorical effect . The author finds the distance important . It lends an air of authenticity and nearness to the subject . As advertising technique , this confident repetition is effective . Despite the number of times I have driven the 250 miles from Diisseldorf on the Rhine to the Soviet barrier at Helmstedt , and the 200 miles from Mainz to the Soviet-zone frontier near Nordhausen ? I traveled in this area constantly from early April , 1945 , to the end of July , 1947-1 found myself reaching uncertainly for a map and rechecking distances . The book Is like that . It bounces along , breathing the self-assurance that has come from " several weeks ' firsthand study of the German ! situation " : All these things could be by James Stewart Martin done ? and done with surprising rapidity by JO industrious and resourceful a people as the Germans ? if materials and properly fed manpower were available and adequate incentives existed to induct Germany to go to work with a will . ( Italics mine . - J. S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morgenthau policy , as expressed in the Potsdam Agreement , says Brown confidently . We must stop trying to bring democracy to Germany . We must put the old , experienced management back in the saddle , build up German heavy industry and give the German people a taste of the old-line " leadership " they are so used to and love so well . Brown leaves no doubt that the economic principles of the Potsdam Agreement represent the destructive and repressive philosophy of the Morgenthau Plan , that our policy in Germany so far has been destructive , and that this accounts for Germany 's lag . It requires only a few minutes ' study of two documents to show that the Potsdam Agreement in no way represents the policy of industrial extirpation advocated by Morgenthau . The Potsdam Agreement provided that Germany should be fitted into the reconstructed European economy in such a way that she would not be in a position to dominate or control that econ omy , but would still be in a position to contribute on a peaceful and constructive basis . For that reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be closed , as the Morgenthau Plan proposed , but that coal production should be greatly enlarged . To keep the German population from depending more than was necessary on food imports , it provided further that food production in Germany should be stepped up to the greatest possible extent . On both these points , with much of their old-time management calling the plays and giving the advice , the Germans have dropped the ball completely . No foundation . Brown has no trouble putting a sticky thumb on such talk . The miners do n't mine coal because they are hungry and lack incentives , he says . While the French and Soviets pay nothing to feed their Germans and yet cart away surplus production , " our " Germans are so hungry they ca n't be expected to work , even though US and British taxpayers are footing a bill of several hundred million dollars a year to feed them . As for growing more food ? the Russians have all the brown coal from which to make phosphate fertiliZer . Brown says the brown coal " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Actually , prewar Germany'imported about 885,000 metric tons of crude phosphate a year , half the imports coming from the US and most of the rest from French North Africa , with a little from Russia . The only large domestic source was basic phosphate slag , a byproduct of the iron and steel industry . Most of the slag was obtained from the Ruhr or imported from the steel diSkids of France and Belgium . Brown coal is not , and can not be , used to produce metallurgical coke . The author evidently confuses the use of brown coal to produce hydrogen for the synthetic-ammonia process ? out of which comes ammonium nitrate , nitrate fertilizer ? with the phosphate recovery from metallurgical slag . Nitrate production goes on today in all four zones . It is phosphate fertilizer which is particularly scarce in Germany . However , while Brown 's metallurgical and chemical facts may be fuzzy , his politics is still confident . k 's all the fault of the Russians , anyhow . Potsdam called for substantial increases in the light or consumer-goods industries which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumer supplies for German domestic use . It also required reduction of the previous concentration of heavy industry , the prewar uneconomic mania of German leaders bent on autarchy . The artificial build-up of German heavy industry at the expense of idle equipment in France , Belgium , Holland and Luxembourg was to be avoided . The needs of Europe were to be supplied first , so far as possible , by restoring maximum production in the atm-German heavy-industry centers and rebuilding German heavy industry only to the extent necessary . But Brown 's " several weeks ' firsthand study " has convinced him that everyone else was wrong . " German militarism is dead . . . . k is time we quit fighting ghosts and got on with the real business of getting Germany back at work . " Since we do n't need to worry about a future German menace , we should scrap Potsdam and put German heavy industry out in front . To do that we have to give the industrialists assurance that they will retain control of their plants . Then they will call off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of policy , I am confident from the talks I have had with many German industrialists that they would immediately Call their workmen together and inspire them with the idea that now they had a chance to rebuild Germany . The result would be a surprising application of energy and ingenuity applied to the program of getting production started . The leading industrialists , given assurance of their continued control of plants and the certainty that " denazification " was over , could get Germany going in short order : . We can let elected officials reign . But the best brains of Germany we can find , appointed by Uncle Sam who is destined to foot the bill , should rule , under our hand . In such a government the German masses would have confidence . They respect brains and from them they will take orders and like it ? particularly if the fist of government is behind . That , to the Germans is lead-. ership . Lest we remain unclear about who are these best brains of Germany , Brown tells us four times : they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Germany , " who had climbed on the Nazi bandwagon much as people climb on any . . . apparently successful bandwagon . " Another point in their favor : The sincere fear of Bolshevism by the more cultured of the German people also played a part in Hitler 's rise to power . In all parts of Europe there were those who preferred the Nazis to the Communists , seeking the lesser of two evils , though with heavy heart . They little realized until too late that the difference in practice between these two forms of totalitarianism was trivial . Brown chooses to ignore the fact that we never really threw the German old guard out . He therefore concludes that we must reverse our policies on control of Germany , so as to put the former leaders back into power in order to build up Germany as a bulwark against Russia . He feels confident , and has the assurance of a number of leading German industrialists on the point , that in the event of war with Russia the Germans would , of course , be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very definite German fear of Russian domination is so great . " If we " make possible recovery and a higher standard of living in Germany , " we can be certain of this . Therefore Nothing must interfere with this objective . When we once have production ? when the economic machine is again working at a reasonably high ' level ? then will be time enough for the German people to decide upon the refinements of reform . But what about the recovery of the rest of Europe ? The Marshall Plan has been , officially at least , a plan to rebuild Europe as a whole , not a plan to build up Germany as a buffer against Russia . For the rest of Europe , especially France , Brown 's formula is simple : cut off coal exports from Germany entirely . Put a moratorium on the annual shipment of 10 million tons of coal out of Germany , so that she herself can use the coal industrially . Then let the socialistic British government reverse its nationalization policy , put its miners back on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the week by greater efforts . Apparently some leadership and some incentives should also be applied to the pants of British miners , who are lagging under " soft socialism . " Then , having boosted British annual production by nearly 20 million tons , let France and the other ' countries get 10 million , which would otherwise have come from Germany ; and Britain would still have five or ten million extra for her own economic needs . Unfortunately one can not simply dismiss this book for the nonsense it is . It has not been possible to detail its hundreds of falsifications and inaccuracies . Factually , a schoolboy could have done better sitting at home and reading the daily papers . But that is not the point . Brown 's trip to Germany was engineered by the use of a great deal of pressure in Washington , and from Washington to Germany . Brown 's prefatory acknowledgments leave little doubt about the connection between his visit , and his observations thereon , and the rapprochement between the Morgan interests and the Dillon , Read group on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Company , as a financial group , has long had the inside track for financial operations involving German y ? n t merely because some of its former members are high in government circles , but also because of the banking fraternity 's custom of recognizing one another 's " historical positions . " Dillon , Read handled the major financial moves after World War I , which enabled Thyssen and the other Ruhr industrialists , who later backed Hitler , to get firmly entrenched in their control of the German economy . The Morgan group , on the other hand , " historically " has had France for its bailiwick , and could have been expected to look with favor on some financial help to France . But this book shows how Morgan can eat its cake and have it , too . If France wants help , Britain can abandon nationalization , get out the coal for France ; and France can come to " private investors or steel companies " in the United States for help . Time for action . Something ought to be done about such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the silly repetitions , the juvenile and ignorant discussion based on a brief encounter with German guile and self-assurance . This book has had enough promotion to have sold Forever Amber twice over . The nation 's business periodicals have been getting geared to ballyhoo it as a sensible and constructive proposal for a solution to the German problem . The place to direct action , however , is not against Brown , who is having his fling in the spotlight , but against the operators behind the light . Specifically , the operators are the investment bankers who are advertising their newly found power over our official government policies . If this book in any sense represents United States policy , Vishinsky did n't say the half of it . The only clear way to repudiate this policy of reversion to the old order , which Hitler called a " New Order , " would be to get rid of the high-level policy makers who have arranged these efforts by " independent observers " to set out a new policy . This may be a good time for a congressional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the United States than some of the recent theatrics that have been holding the spotlight on Capitol Hill .
