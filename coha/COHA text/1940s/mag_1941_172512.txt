Refuting the oft-repeated libel that Roman Catholics are not allowed to read the Bible , the Holy Name Society will start a drive next week to put a new New Testament into all the 4,500,000 Catholic homes in the U.S. <P> Occasion of the drive is the first authorized Catholic English-language revision of Holy Writ since 1749 , a simplified text which omits inverted phrases and archaic word forms , changes " tidings " to " news , " " concupiscence " to " lust , " " wilderness " to " desert , " " bier " to " stretcher . " Even the words of the sign of the cross , with which every Roman Catholic begins and ends his prayers , have been changed-the Holy Ghost is now called the Holy Spirit . Typical modernization : Matthew XIll 's reference to Christ 's miracle-working powers from " Whence therefore hath he all these things , " to " Then where did he get all this ? " <P> Not only is the text simplified but ( as in The Bible Designed to Be Read as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbered verses . Poems are printed as poems , letters as letters . <P> The New Testament is ready now . Bishop Edwin Vincent O'Hara of Kansas City , head of the revisory committee , says that by 1944 U.S. Catholics should have a new Old Testament as well . <P> Roman Catholics have never accepted the King James version of the Bible used by Protestants . Their Bible is based on a translation made by exiled English priests at Douai and Reims in the 16th Century . Seventy-two U.S. bishops have already urged Catholics in their dioceses to adopt the new revision . No Protestant denomination has as yet taken any comparable step in urging its members to discard the King James version for one of the several modernized translations offered in recent years .
