When Lieut . General George S. Patton Jr . ' s U.S. Seventh Army splashed up the beaches of Sicily , the innards of much of its motor equipment were protected from the sea with a thick , gummy substance that was the result of a near-miracle of production back home . Last week Standard Oil Co . ( New Jersey ) proudly let the miracle out of the bag . <P> Late one Friday , Army Ordnance telephoned Jersey Standard in Manhattan . Said Ordnance : General Dwight D. Eisenhower had just cabled , asking for immediate delivery of 45,000 lb. of a special water-repellent compound never before made in the U.S. Eisenhower had just heard of the new compound from the British , who had used it with great success . The goo was sketchily described . By Monday enough machinery had been thrown together to fill the order ; materials had been rushed by police-escorted Army trucks to Standard 's Baltimore grease plant . <P> Then the fun began . First off , a sample of the real goo ( flown in from North Africa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original description , and more hard-to-get materials had to be commandeered . The goo was so unusual and heavy that Standard 's grease equipment had to be jacked up with Rube Goldbergian extra belts , pulleys and paddles . But by the following Sunday the order was done , four hours before the promised delivery time . By that time the plant was half-wrecked , as equipment collapsed under the strain . Then the Army asked for another 200,000 Ib. by the following weekend . At that point Standard threw in its big Pittsburgh grease plant , while more Army trucks dashed all over western Pennsylvania gathering up extra drums and materials . <P> The Pittsburgh plant , as well as the limping Baltimore factory , worked night &; day , while their supervisory staffs took cat naps on the floor . Army bombers took the last 22,000 lb. of production to the seaboard . By 11:45 a.m. on Friday , June 11 , just two weeks after the first Army phone call and only seven hours after it left Standard 's Pittsburgh plant , the final vat was stowed away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that no one even thought to talk about contracts and cost . But by last week , with the new invasion an amphibious success , the cost of Standard 's Sicilian sidelight seemed academic .
