The problem was still the same old problem . The enemy , dispersed across the world , pinned down the Allies on too many fronts . Unhappily-and unavoidably , the High Commands seemed to think-the only solution was still the one that had solved nothing yet . The Allies , dispersing their forces to meet the enemy wherever he was , in essence let the Axis General Staffs determine the grand strategy of the war . Lieut . General Brehon B , Somervell of the U.S. Army brutally stated the consequences last week . Said he : " We are losing the war . " <P> The fronts where the enemy had to be met were growing : <P> &gt; Field Marshal Rommel 's rested , reinforced Afrika Korps seemed about to launch the drive for Egypt , Suez and mastery of the Mediterranean . <P> &gt; The Germans , pressing through Egypt and the Caucasus , had compelled Britain and the U.S. to begin , hurriedly and late , the building of a preventive army in Iraq and Persia under General Sir Henry Maitland ( " Jumbo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The British already had some forces there , but the sudden appointment of General Wilson and the feverish reinforcement were evidence that , in effect , a new army was being created for a new front . <P> &gt; The British and a few Americans , beset in India , grew tense at indications that the Japanese invasion forces in Burma awaited only the end of the monsoon rains this month . <P> &gt; Adolf Hitler , on the war 's third anniversary , hinted that Japan would soon attack Russia . In How War Came , published last week , Reporters Forrest Davis and Ernest K. Lindley report that in the Tripartite Pact Japan promised Germany to attack Siberia when the German Army reached the Volga . <P> &gt; The U.S. , driving a tiny dent into Japan 's Pacific wall , now had to find the men , the ships and the planes to breach the wall . <P> Dispersed Concentration ? The week 's portents were not all bad for the Allies : <P> &gt; London stirred with rumors that Churchill was about to reorganize his command system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , General Sir Archibald Wavell , to be Churchill 's military right bower ? No one knew . Churchill had never really warmed to Wavell-at least until recently . But Sir Henry Maitland Wilson was Wavell 's favorite ; the separation of Sir Henry 's command from that of General Alexander in Egypt and Syria had long been General Wavell 's idea . London expected to hear more of Wavell , and of his plans for close Anglo-American contact with the Russians . <P> &gt; The High Commands were at least informed , and were certainly thinking , about the possibilities of real air concentration against Germany . <P> &gt; If there had to be dispersal , only dispersal-in-strength could beat the enemy on his fronts . The U.S. Navy and Marines in the Pacific had found enough ships , men and planes to overwhelm the thinly extended Japs in the Solomons . MacArthur and his Australians were ready with enough troops to set back , perhaps defeat , the Japs in New Guinea . Even the Chinese , supported by a small U.S. air force , had concentrated enough power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kiangsi . Plainly the Japs were suffering more from their dispersals than the Allies suffered at the points of specific action last week .
