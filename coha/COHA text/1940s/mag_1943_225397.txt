Last week a U.S. Senator from Kentucky assured his name of a footnotelet in the pages of history . He challenged , at a moment of historic decision , the basic Allied strategy of the war , and received an unprecedented reply delivered in person by the Prime Minister of Great Brittain before a joint session of the U.S. Congress . <P> Senator Albert Benjamin ( " Happy " ) Chandler was answered in such historic fashion because he was not speaking only for himself .

But next day the Prime Minister of Great Britain took the rostrum and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
