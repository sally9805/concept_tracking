If you want a war , nourish a doctrine . <P> Militarism is produced by a constant preoccupation with the chances of war . <P> It is no paradox at all to say that peace makes war and that war makes peace . <P> Political liberty inside of any country depends very largely upon its external relations . <P> These timely pronouncements were uttered by the late Professor William Graham Sumner of Yale , who was born in 1840 and died in 1910 . He it was who coined the forgotten term " Forgotten Man " - though Sumner applied it not to the faceless proletariat but to the harried bourgeoisie , which always paid the bill . <P> A tough-minded 19th-Century giant , founding father of modern social science in the U. S. , Sumner was a great and galvanizing teacher , who has become a Yale legend . Five years after his thunderous lectures ceased forever , a group of his one time students and disciples organized the William Graham Sumner Club . This year , the centenary of the great man 's birth , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which are a joy to every good Republican . More importantly , the anniversary was marked last week by the publication of a centennial edition of Sumner 's Folkways ( Ginn ; $4 ) , a profoundly influential book .

From Huxley , Sumner went on , demolishing one cherished faith after another , with what he called " shovelfuls of facts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clergyman . But nine years after his graduation from Yale he went back there as professor of political and social science , started compiling a great mass of anthropological data which comprises the bulk of Folkways . In it he covered the origin and evolution of marriage and family , religion , government , abortion , infanticide , social codes , crime &; punishment , slavery , patriotism and chauvinism , labor , wealth and 1,001 other facets of human society . Many surviving mores ( a term he himself brought into common scientific usage ) were irrational , often harmful , and he said so savagely . <P> Sumner was always less irritated by taboos , rituals and fetishes of primitives than by those of civilization . At Yale he regularly raised hell in faculty meetings . Once , when President Arthur Twining Hadley offered a mild difference of opinion , Sumner barked : " But it 's the truth ! " " That is possible , " said Hadley , " but it is not always necessary to tell the truth butt-end first . " Said Sumner : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
