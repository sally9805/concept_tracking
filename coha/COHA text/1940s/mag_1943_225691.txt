Many a U.S. soldier in England , after sampling Britain 's flat , fizzless ( and now watery ) beer , has longed for the soft drinks of his home-town drugstore . Last week the Army announced that he will soon get them . Army post exchanges are importing soda fountains , drink-dispensing machines , ice-cream freezers . Also on the way : U.S. civilian soda jerkers , who will teach soldiers and civilian workers the trade , perhaps the lingo.
