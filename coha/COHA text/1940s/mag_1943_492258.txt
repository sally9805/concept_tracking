( Continued from Page 15 ) the rugged interior . They still can not believe that the change is permanent . " My dear fellow , " the former Number Two of a large British shipping concern told me in confidence , " after the war I shall give them three years  --  and I 'm being generous ! You can depend on John Chinaman for making a mess of his own country , and I 'll eat my hat if he has n't started a bloody civil war by that time and we have to step in again and get back our treaty ports to survive . " However , such die-hards are few and far between . You 'll probably find them more often among Britons than among Americans , for the simple reason that Americans , both by temperament and by breeding , are not imperial-minded . It is only fair to say that most of the Britons out here , especially the younger set , have adjusted themselves to the changed tone painlessly and cheerfully . Yankee Leaven The presence of American troops on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lads are not burdened by traditional white man 's attitudes , and their refreshingly unorthodox approach makes some of the old-timers squirm . They have , in the short time that they 've been out here , succeeded in personalizing the relationship between white and yellow with a dash of Yank directness . Their mess boys are not Number One and Number Two but merrily answer to such names as Ching-pao  --  air raid  --  Shanghai , Fu Manchu . They have popularized the hitchhiker 's gesture all over the Chinese countryside and they 'll stop the jeep to give a cabbage farmer a lift into town any time . With a tiny vocabulary they manage to carry on lengthy conversations with the Chinese . Wherever they go , kids will greet them with the thumbs-up salute and a breezy Chinese version of hello . In the old days , the only city where foreigners and Chinese mingled freely was Peking . There , under the glassy blue sky of the north , where a pale sun shone on the yellow tiles and deep-red walls of the Forbidden City , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ served them by Chinese scholars and their wives .

It was a society which knew no prejudice , and it was good fun while it lasted . But the foreigners who had chosen the asylum of the imperial capital were the same blas ? and footloose crowd you encountered in Florence , Cannes and Munich , and the experiment was carried on in so rarefied an atmosphere and on ao remote a level that it was irrelevant . Here you meet the Chinese in the raw , and you 'd better get used to them in a hurry . " You either Like them , " an Australian lady remarked , " or you go crazy . When we lived in Tientsin , my husband and I , we rarely met any Chinese . Once in a while , we went for a meal in a Chinese restaurant , and the Chinese we went along with were  --  well , housebroken . They behaved like foreigners themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the way they 've been for four thousand years . And you have to squeeze yourself into a bus right along with them , and like it . They 'll be there with their chickens and their babies and their pigs , laughing , shouting , crying , spitting , gesticulating , twenty-four hours a day . I tell you you 've got to like them ; you 'd go bats if you did n't ! " Do n't get me wrong ; there really are no foreign women out here any more . Thanks to the foresight of the United States State Department , most American women left China long before Pearl Harbor . The British have been less methodical , but actual conditions have driven all but a few Englishwomen home . Other nationalities are in the same boat . That leaves a mere handful of diplomats ' , missionaries ' and businessmen 's wives . Chungking society , consequently , flavors of bachelorhood .

On Saturday nights , Chungking 's bachelors and grass widowers forgather at the Chungking Club , where they form a mile-long bread line for a dance with a good-looking Chinese girl . " And to think , " a former bank clerk from Shanghai muttered to himself , " that in the old days you could lose your job over a date with a Eurasian typist . " The few remaining taitais  --  foreign women  --  are faced with a number of tough problems that were unknown in the treaty-port days , when a foreign household was run on the pattern of the " big house " on the old Dixie plantation . The wife of a taipan could not do without aye or six servants ; a Number One boy and a Number Two boy , a cook , a gardener , an amah , a coolie . Today the taitai has a cook who is a factotum , doing all sorts of odd jobs in house and kitchen , and perhaps a coolie to help him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows no English  --  king 's or pidgin . Gone with the wind are the fancy recipes , and , anyway , there would be no point in ordering your favorite dish , for you have to take whatever the market offers . The market offers precious little , The hiring of an additional servant has become a budgetary problem that no amount of arithmetic can overcome . The other day a friend of mine caught his wife standing on a chair , washing the windows . Being a Shanghai man , he was properly shocked . " But , dear , " said she , " I was doing the same thing when we lived in Philadelphia  --  remember ? " Which put the husband in his place . As for a new dress , the taitai is happy to wear that tight 1936 skirt and the green jumper Mrs. Stone sold her last year before she left for home . For lipsticks she depends entirely on the charity of a friend of her husband , who will try to pick one up on his next trip to Calcutta . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but no more perfume , silk stockings or girdles . The Chinese Side There are no parties , except for an occasional invitation for dinner at a bachelors ' mess or an informal reception at the embassy . The movies are old , and the electric power is not strong enough to give you the full enjoyment . There are few restaurants left , and those few serve a limited number of dishes at a limited number of tables to a limited number of guests . Whisky-soda , by many regarded as the staff of life of the treaty ports , has disappeared ; the substitutes are far from satisfactory  --  in Kweilin they 'll serve you tiger-bone wine , in Kunming homemade absinthe , in Chungking something white and horrible that goes under the name of Chungking gin . How do the Chinese themselves feel about the new trend in their relationship with the foreign devils ? " Frankly , " the more thoughtful among them will tell you . " it is a distinct improvement . The foreigner has learned to behave himself . He does not go about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become a human being . " The Chinese masses , though illiterate and not conversant with world affairs , are aware of their changed relationships with the outside world . I was present when Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek , in an impromptu speech , announced the cancellation of the unequal treaties to the citizens of Chungking . Speaking from a platform improvised on the steps of the spiritual-mobilization monument , he told the people of his capital that , from this day on , they were on a par with the citizens of other nations , and , with the reformatory zeal that has become so typical of Chiang in recent years , exhorted them to be worthy of Britain 's and America 's noble gesture . The thundering applause that followed his words showed that the 20,000-odd people who had listened understood the historic significance of the moment . The next day I was walking through one of the narrow alleys in downtown Chungking when a four-year-old brat , playing with a couple of dogs in a halffilled-in bomb crater , yelled " Foreign devil ! " at me at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother came darting out of a doorway , spanked him soundly and told him , " Foreign devil no more ; foreign friend ! " I am not a believer in physical violence as a form of education , but I most say I was delighted . There is , however , another side to the picture . The white man has lost face with the Chinese . After the colossal build-up of a century of mailed-fist imperialism , he flopped ignominiously at the first encounter with a strong enemy . The Chinese were shocked . For more than four years , they had been fighting Japan singlehanded , praying for the day when powerful allies would come to their assistance . The day came , and the powerful allies , with the exception of the heroes of Bataan , scuttled without much of a fight . To be sure , the Chinese knew they 'd be back with reinforcements , but you could not blame them if , for a while , they felt rather let down . " How can one keep his faith in a friend , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hong Kong , " if he talks big and promises everything , and then fails to live up to his promise ? " The territorial losses in Burma and Southeastern Asia , the way the defense of Hong Kong was bungled and the speed with which Singapore fell , left a foul taste in many a mouth ; they have exploded the myth of the white man 's invincibility and brought him down to earth with a bang . Soldiers of the Cross Ironically , it was the missionary who saved the day for the white man  --  the missionary who had never harped on white superiority and the privileges of unequal treaties , who had lived his unpretentious life without indulging in Kiplingesque self-deception . He had refused to cling to the precarious safety of the treaty port and had boldly ventured into the interior , where he met the dragon in his lair . The two got on rather well . When the great test of the Japanese invasion came along , the missionary did not run away . As city after city was engulfed in the brown flood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet heroism that earned him the praise of Christian and heathen Chinee alike . " Those missionaries have plenty of grit , - a Chinese businessman who had left all he owned in the occupied zone , told me . " I am not a Christian myself , and I have not much use for proselytism . Let Christians be Christians and Buddhists be Buddhists . But your missionaries have proved , in these last years of hardship , that they were more than Bible salesmen . " They have n't been afraid of getting right into the mess , and did n't squawk if they got their fingers dirty . What they did during the rape of Nanking , when they shielded Chinese women and children with their own lives and gave medical care to the victims of the Jap orgy , will go down in history as one of the great deeds of humanity . The same goes for Changsha , for Hong Kong and for a thousand other villages and towns . No , the missionary has proved himself a worthy member of our society  --  a fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Where East Meets West Recently , Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek praised the Christian church and its missionaries in China and said the abolition of unequal treaties had freed the Christian church from all association with foreign imperialism or aggression , In an address to the opening session of the First National Christian Conference held since the outbreak of the war , Chiang said : " We still need them the missionaries ) and welcome Christians from other lands who serve the people of China with true sympathy and devotion . Do n't feel you are guests . You are comrades working with us to save our people and build a new nation . " I 've had these views confirmed by hundreds of Chinese , and it seems to me that the foreign missionary is largely responsible for the continued respect the average Chinese has today for the white man . The missionary has stuck by his guns , praising the Lord and passing the spiritual ammunition , and the Chinese do not hesitate to give him credit for it . True , most of the credit is for charitable and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for purely evangelistic work . The reason is that Chinese congregations have come of age and are , in many places , perfectly capable of standing on their own feet . " The tendency here , as elsewhere , is to do things the Chinese way , and to have Chinese do the jobs of foreigners wherever possible , " I was told by Earl H. Cressy from Lacon , Illinois , who has been a missionary in this country for the last thirty-three years . " Fundamentally , that'a a good thing . Nothing is on a solid basis until it is on a Chinese basis . If the foreign missionary has to step out of the picture and become a little less conspicuous , he does n't mind ; he can still help the Chinese make a go of it . " But the plight of the missionary has become acute in another way . I have , in my recent travels through Free China , met many of them in small towns and out-stations , and have spent many a night in a missionary house . The conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is the same story wherever you go ; missionaries still receive their pay in Chinese currency , and their salaries have been left far behind by the rapid pace of Chinese currency inflation . If an unmarried missionary today received $2000 ? Chinesea month , which has the purchasing power of U. S. $40 , he is lucky . Consequently , missionaries are now exposed to downright poverty . They have sold whatever they could spare . First went the bicycle , the typewriter , the radio . Next came the silver , the second suit of clothes . Today , many missionaries are half starved . They can not afford to buy enough meat , enough fruit , enough milk , and the lack of vitamins is beginning to tell ; some of those I 've met , especially women , had the sprue . Their clothes are worn ragged . They are cut off from the world , unable to receive any books or magazines from home . They are weak and still shake with the memories of horrid experiences they had when the Japs came , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the hospital , when shells burst in their compounds . Some have gone to pieces . I have found more than one nervous wreck among missionaries . I shall never forget the clergyman in Hengyang who smiled helplessly whenever someone asked him a question , and whose hands trembled so he could not hold his teacup . Some of them dream of going home , just for a rest ; but then there may never be a chance to come out again and , on the whole , as one of them modestly put it , " missionaries generally have an instinct to stick by their job . " Along with the grand display of guts on the part of the missionary , our voluntary abrogation of the unequal treaties and the growing amount of military aid given China by her allies have helped repair the white man 's damaged prestige . Since my arrival eight months ago in Chungking , I have been able to sense a slow but steady improvement . The news of American naval and air victories in the South Pacific and the victory in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of relief money and every American plane that makes its appearance send up the white man 's stock . What the Future Holds The future ? The war out here will not be over for a long time , and many things happen between now and victory that will affect the foreigner 's position . But trends can be distinguished now , and it is possible to make a few general predictions . It is a pretty safe bet , for example , that in the postwar world there will be no room for arrogance and snobbery in our relations with the Chinese or any other race . More concretely speaking , the fierce nationalism which is now sweeping the Chinese people , and which is likely to assert itself when the shooting is over , will tolerate foreigners only if they come as guests , humbly . No gunboats will come dashing up the coast when the foreigner is in trouble ; if it gets too hot for him , he must get out . The presence of a strong government at the helm of a united China will prevent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a game that , in the old war-lord days , got many a foreign devil into deep water . Indeed , from comments and suggestions heard among Chinese as well as foreigners out here , it seems reasonable to believe that the China merchant of the future will he closely controlled both by his own government and by the Chinese authorities . Such supervision will limit the scope of his operations , keeping his nose to the grindstone and out of Chinese politics . Actually , it will assure the smooth operation of foreign business and may prove a protection more permanent and more solid than the brittle armor of extrality . The basis for treaty ports , of course , is gone with the cancellation of the treaties that had made them . Taipan days will never come back . If Hong Kong remains British after the war  --  the crown colony is British territory and therefore not mentioned in the new Sino-British treaty , which merely deals with extrality , concessions , settlements and the right to sta. tion troops on Chinese soil  --  it will not be possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiny rock . In spirit , if not in actuality , Hong Kong will be Chinese . China 's Growing Pains As for Shanghai , it is still where it used to he  --  where the Yangtze meets the sea . Its strategic location makes it the natural entreptit for the China trade , the clearinghouse for the needs , goods and bills of the 200,000,000 people inhabiting the valley of the mighty river . Its future prosperity is guaranteed by geographic facts , the politics can not interfere with its destiny . This prosperity will not be the monopoly of a foreign group  --  as , indeed , even before the war a growing number of Chinese shared in the profits and the administration of the International Settlement . The reconstruction of the great city , largest on the continent of Asia , will lie in the hands of Chinese and foreigners alike , and the new era of Sino-foreign co-operation will get its first workout there . " After the war , " Dr. T. V. Soong , China 's foreign minister , told me early this year in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and corner of our country . The effort will absorb the energies of one , two or three generations of Chinese . " For this gigantic scheme , China will need foreign assistance ; along with money and machines , she must secure the help of foreign experts and technicians . Some of the activities of foreigners out here may require permanent residence . But in most cases , the foreigner will come to China on a flying visit  --  to drill oil wells , to set up machinery , to plan a factory or railroad , to help build a dam , to organize a dairy farm , and to go home again . There will be less room , in other words , for foreign families ; there will be fewer foreign women out here , and foreign children will not have to be brought up by doting amahs , who were a sinister influence , anyway , because they were apt to rear little taipans who raised hell when they did not get what they fancied . The future belongs to the short-term visitor . Already , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provinces of Free China , I have met with American dairy , cattle and potato specialists , with engineers , geologists , experts in road building and co-operative planning . They are inconspicuous people in trench coats who are doing their jobs quietly and efficiently , and who know they 'll be home for Christmas . While China is still shaking with the torment of war , the new trend in Chinese-foreign co-operation has already begun . The foreigner  --  foreign devil no more  --  will continue to serve the Chinese ; he will help them shape a free and prosperous republic where 450,000,000 people , for the first time in their history as a nation , can enjoy the riches which nature has stowed away in their good earth . We may have lost our unequal treaties and the glittering paraphernalia of the imperial century , but we are on our way to gaining the confidence and the good will of a good people . Personally , having lived in Shanghai and remembering the brighter yesterdays not without an occasional pang of nostalgia , I like it better this way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
