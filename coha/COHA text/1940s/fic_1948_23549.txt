THE CAPTAIN AND THE STOWAWAY A STORY BY SCOTT SEEGERS Illustrated by Arthur Shilstone I N A way , the captain himself suggested that I stow away on the Santa Elisa . The ship was in harbor in Puntarenas , the Pacific port of Costa Rica , and I had gone aboard to ask him if I could work my way back to the United States . I will never forget how clean he looked in his white uniform , or how cold his blue eyes were as they took in my huarache-clad feet , the brown , bug-bitten shanks above them , and my ragged dungarees and patched shirt . He was a tall , fair , good-looking man about forty years old . His calm , grave face showed neither good nor bad humor as he sat behind his shining desk , " This line is operated for profit , " he said concisely . " There is no profit in taking on unnecessary people . You got down here . I suggest you get back the same way . " His voice was completely indifferent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with irrevocable logic , without charity , humor , or malice . " Sir , I walked down here . I 'd never make it back afoot because I 've been in the hospital a long time . " " That is hard luck , " he said in the same tone . " But you can hardly expect the line to feel responsible for your decision to walk to Costa Rica . And even if we were shorthanded , we 'd want someone who could work , not a man just out of the hospital . " " Yes sir , " I said , and tripped over the high doorsill as I left the cabin . The Captain called me back . " And do n't stow away , " he said with emphasis . " Because if you do , we 'll throw you in jail at the first port we reach after we find you , and have the next southbound Grace liner pick you up and land you right back in Puntarenas . " His words came one at a time , very wide apart . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said . " I had n't even thought of it . " The Captain relaxed a little . " Well , do n't , " he said . B ACK on the long wooden dock reaching out from the sand spit on which the port is built , I turned for a last look at the Santa Elisa . Well-fed , well-dressed passengers made a gay procession up and down her gangplank as they came and went for short visits ashore . On her decks , stevedores and crew pulled ropes , yelled orders , and wrestled with big bales of cargo . The ship 's long black bulk would be tied up at a California port within a couple of weeks . She was all fresh paint and power and security , and she was my first tangible fink with the United States for many months . She , and all the people aboard her , were going home , to faces and voices and streets and houses they knew . With sudden desperation I knew that if I could help it that ship would not turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Puntarenas . I went ashore and got my pack and serape and came back . How did one stow away ? I might climb a hawser , but there were too many people on deck and on the dock . The only other connection between ship and shore was the gangplank , and at the top of it stood the quartermaster , a spotless young man in white uniform and officer 's cap . He had let me by to talk to the Captain . Right now it seemed that he was all that stood between me and home . Without any plan at all I started up the gangplank as if I was hypnotized . It was a mile long , and the quartermaster watched every step I took . At the top I stopped and stared at him dumbly . I still had no plan . He gave me a wide grin , and said : " So the Old Man 's going to let you work your way , is he ? " " Yes , " I gulped . " That 's fine ! I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mate . We 're shoving off in an hour . " He slapped me on the shoulder . Somehow I got across the deck and through a door . I was in a big room with a waxed linoleum floor and some potted palms . Behind a desk some men in uniform were busy with papers . A lot of suitcases sat on the floor . A flight of stairs curved up on either side of the room , and some passengers coming down stopped to look at me curiously . I did n't know where to go , but I started up the stairs . Halfway up , quick panic flashed through me . I began to run . Upstairs , I went through a door and came out on deck . I saw another flight of stairs and ran up them . Like a cat climbing in scared frenzy I felt dimly that concealment and safety lay in height , and I climbed all the stairs I could find . Then there were no more stairs . I saw a big ventilator below a hole in the roof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hole , looking for something else to climb . But above me was only the sky , and the big black funnel chuffing calmly : On either side of the deck hung lifeboats , which I had always heard were good hiding places . But these were covered tightly with canvas . Beside me a life raft sat on wooden blocks about fifteen inches above the deck . I shoved my pack and serape under the raft and wriggled in after them , pushing myself on my stomach with my hands and feet . Well under , I lay listening to my jerky breathing and feeling my solar plexus thump against the deck with every heartbeat . I HAD been aboard the ship probably less than a minute . Half an hour later I heard the pounding feet and urgent voices of pursuit . " Did he come up here ? " " How the hell do I know ? The Old Man said to look in the lifeboats . What does he look like , anyhow ? " " Quartermaster said he was pretty much of a bum . Had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I guess we 'll know him . " I heard them stripping back the canvas covers of the lifeboats . " Well , he 's not in any of them . Did they look in the engine room . " " Yeah . He 's not there . Wonder where the hell he could have got to . " " We 've done what the Oki Man said , so what do we care ? Boy , is he going to have a hemorrhage ! This is the fourth stowaway , and the Old Man 's first trip in command of a ship . When he catches that guy , he 'll kill ' im I " Two pairs of shoes and about six inches of trousers legs came into view , walking toward the life raft . A couple of feet from my face the two pairs of toes stood facing each other . I tried to hold my breath . First one pair , then the other turned slowly outward , so that I was looking at the heels of the shoes . The life raft creaked loudly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Gim me a cigarette . " They did n't say anything for a few minutes . I fought back a crazy impulse to laugh out loud . I wondered what they would do if I reached out and grabbed their ankles . The toe of one shoe kept making little semicircles on the deck . Back and forth , back and forth . I wished it would stop . Then one sailor said , " We 'd better get below . It 's about time to shove off . Funny where that guy got to . " The feet walked away . Soon I heard the hawsers being taken aboard , and saw Puntarenas change position as we swung away from the dock . Then the ship began to throb , and the shoreline receded as she picked up speed . I wanted to yell . Even if they found me now , they could n't put me ashore before reaching Corinto , Nicaragua , and Corinto was several weary weeks of walking from Puntarenas . I was sure I could get out of the Corinto jail , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soon the midday sun probed between the slats of the life raft , softening the tar on the deck . I remembered that I had n't had a drink of water since early morning . I got tired of lying on my stomach , and tried to roll over , but could n't turn my shoulders in the narrow space between deck and life raft . I tried several times , and then , cautiously as a hermit crab , I inched out far enough to flop over and scuttle back underneath on my back . That was pure luxury . I went to sleep with my head on my serape. / sum ' have slept for two or three hours . When I awoke the deck was hotter than ever . r tried to shift my position a little , but I could n't move . I wondered briefly and wildly if I was paralyzed . But it was just the melted tar sticking to my back . I twisted loose , getting tar on my hands and face . I wanted a drink of water and I wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my hermit-crab twist when I heard two sets of footsteps coming across the deck toward me . One set was quick and light and feminine . The other sounded heavy and emphatic and confident , like a salesman who has just signed a big order . They headed for almost the same spot where the two sailors had rested . One pair of shoes was high-heeled brown alligator with very nice ankles rising out of them . The other pair was expensive-looking brown and white wing-tip sport shoes with a lot of fancy stitching and perforations . A pair of bright blue flannel slacks dangled above them . The two pairs of heels turned toward me as their owners sat on the edge of the raft in silence . Presently I heard a gentle scuffle and the high heels twitched . " Darling , not here ! " exclaimed a soft , breathless voice . " Aw , there 's nobody up here , " urged a deeper voice . " Besides , it 's been so long . " " I know , Darling . I tried to get away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little town . We have to be very careful , you know . " One of the wing-tip shoes moved closer to those of alligator . " I 've been careful , but there 's a limit to what I can stand . Where were you at lunch ? I 'm not so sure you 're even trying to get away from him . " The alligator shoes sat up straight and prim , very close together . " Charles , how can you say such a thing after . . . . If you must know we had lunch in the bar , where I got him started on Planter 's Punches , and that 's where I left him . I think you 're horrid ! " Both wing-tips slid over against the alligator shoes , which leaned to meet them . " Darling , forgive me . I guess I 'm just so crazy jealous of you I do n't know what I 'm saying . " A faint rustle came from above me , and a little gasp . " There , you 're all lipsticky ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't ! " The alligator shoe on the left rose and made a quick little arc , crossing tightly over the other one . " Charles , you just must be more careful in daylight . It 's crazy for us to be up here anyhow , and you know it . " " OK " came the grumbling answer . " I guess you 're right . " The wing-tips moved a foot or so away from the alligator shoes , which uncrossed and sat beside each other again . The romance seemed to languish , and I went to sleep . When I waked again the shoes were gone . My head had slipped off the serape and one side of my face was covered with tar . More tar was in my hair . The cramped space under the raft was a furnace in the insane heat of the blazing afternoon . I was very thirsty and very uncomfortable . I turned over again , but it did n't help much . I tried to concentrate on the distant shoreline , but it was too far away and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relaxed and thought how wonderful a glass of cold water would be . I dozed off a few more times , and after a long time the sun went down and the blessed cool of the night came . Cautiously I crawled from under the raft and sat on the edge of it . I stretched my stiff arms and legs and looked around me . T HE funnel stood huge and black against the dark blue sky , with a red glow hovering about its top . Just at the bottom of the funnel , more light came from the open top of a big square ventilator . I walked over and peered in , and almost fainted . I was looking straight down at the top of an enormous stove about three stories below . The stove was covered with big pots and kettles which sent up as tantalizing an assortment of smells as the nose of man ever telegraphed to a reeling brain . I caught the ventilator lid to keep from falling in , and stood inhaling great lungfu ! s of the wonderful stuff . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the deck and looked at the warm , dark sky , and the reflections of the porthole lights on the water . I tried to pick out constellations . I walked aft and watched the ship 's phosphorescent wake streaming toward the invisible horizon . I did everything I could think of to keep away from that ventilator , but in the end I always went back for more . But no dinner lasts forever . After the galley lights were turned out I spread my serape on the raft and went to sleep . About dawn I awoke and prowled about the deck watching the stars fade . Before it got light I stuffed my serape back under the raft and crawled in after it . I did n't know how much longer I could stand it without water . But if I could hold out until after we left Corinto , I would n't be put ashore until San Jose , El Salvador , another good jump up the coast . I got a scare that morning . A Mexican deckhand was painting along the edge of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a level with mine . I watched him come nearer with every stroke of the brush . He came so close I could see the pores in the skin of his face . Just as I thought he would pass without seeing me , he raised his head and looked straight into my eyes . At that distance it was almost like a physical collision . I put my finger to my lips and whispered , " Que no digas nada ! Do n't say anything " He looked down at once and mumbled back , " OK . To no dip nada , " and went on painting . I wanted to ask him for some water , but I was afraid to . When we put in at Corinto I stayed hidden . I do n't remember very much about the second afternoon , but we put into two more ports and put to sea again . I dozed a good deal , and felt very weak . BOUT dark I crawled out . I was dizzy and my tongue and mouth were terribly dry . A man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said , " Good evening . " My voice sounded scratchy and it hurt my throat to talk . He glanced up and said , " Good evening , " and walked away . I had thought surrendering would be easier than that . I followed the man , andwhen I stopped again , I said : " I 'm a stowaway . Could you tell me where I can get a drink of water ? " " You 're the stowaway , are you ? " he asked as calmly as if no ship was complete without one . " Yes , " I said . " Can I get a drink of water ? " " Where did you get on ? " " Puntarenas . I 'd like a drink . I 'm terribly thirsty . " " Puntarenas , eh ? Where the hell have you been all this time ? " " Under there , " I pointed to the raft . " Could I have a drink ? " " je-SUS ! You 've been up here without any water since we left Puntarenas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After I had drunk until my insides sloshed , he turned me over to the mate , a square , underslung man whose jaw stuck out as far as his nose did . " Oh Christ ! " said the mate . " So you were on board after all . We 'd just about decided you were n't . Boy , will the Old Man burn up ! " He lit his pipe . " Well , come on . Guess /11 have to shackle you to the rail until morning . " He took me to the after deck and snapped a leg iron on one ankle , locking the other end around a stanchion . " Comfortable ? Wait a minute , I 'll get the other one . " He came back in a minute with another iron which he snapped onto the first , giving me twice as much chain . I slept long and luxuriously , free from fear of discovery , and rolling over whenever I felt like it . I opened my eyes in the morning to see a tight little ring of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Where did I get on board ? Could I speak English ? Where was I from ? Where had I hidden ? They all agreed that the Old Man would be very , very angry . " I expect he will be mad , " I said dolefully . " At Puntarenas I asked him if I could work my way , and he said no , and warned me not to stow away . " Silence dropped over the group . One sailor gave a long , low whistle . The others got up and walked away slowly . One came back with a big sandwich which I ate in two bites and sat waiting for the Apocalypse . Presently the mate came for me . " Sleep all right ? " he asked , unlocking my shackles . " Yes . Fine , " I said . " I guess the Captain wants to see me now . " " Yeah , " said the mate in tar and whiskers off my face , maybe ? " " You are pretty messed up , are n't you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to bring you right up . " He took a step , hesitated , and turned back to me . " You know , the Old Man is really a pretty good guy , " he said earnestly . " But you 're his fourth stowaway this trip . His fourth . " " Yes , they told me , " I said nervously . " And he did tell you in Puntarenas not to stow away , did n't he ? " " Yes sir . " The mate took a deep breath and let it out . " Well , come on , " he said . T HE Captain was mad . The curtain between his cabin and the bath billowed as before a typhoon when the Captain came roaring through it , half-shaven . " What the hell do you mean stowing away on this ship after I told you not to ? " I opened my mouth , but no sound came . He did n't really want an answer , anyhow . He kept on roaring . My knees were shaking . I backed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a bench . The Captain followed me , step by step , bellowing . His hand hit the side of my head in a heavy slap . My legs folded up and I sat hard on the bench . I stood up again , shakily . " What the hell do you expect to do now you 're on board ? " yelled the Captain . " I hope to work , sir , " I gulped . " Work , hell ! " He drew back his fist . He did n't hit me , though . He opened his hand and reached out and pushed me in the chest . I sat down again . " Sir , he 's been sick , " intervened the mate . The Captain glared . " Too bad he did n't die , " he growled . " All right , take him back up on the sun deck , shackle himto the life raft , and do n't give him any food or water until we get to Champerico . We 'll throw him in jail there . " Silently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snapped the shackles on me . I was still shaking . A few minutes later the Quartermaster appeared with a big pitcher of water and a plate of sandwiches . " The mate sent these up , " he said . Then he sat down beside me . " You 're an American , are n't you ? " " Yes , " I said , fighting to keep my voice steady . " Wel ! , look . He ca n't put you ashore at Champerico or anywhere else until we put in at a U.S. port . That 's international maritime law . You just sit tight and say nothing . " He paused . " You know , the Old Man really is n't such a bad guy . But a lot of things have happened this trip . " " I know . Four stowaways , " I quavered . I tried hard to keep hold of myself , but I was too shaken up . The humiliating tears came trickling down my face . I turned my head away so he would n't see . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked away . A little while later the Captain came up . He was still mad , but he pretended not to see the pitcher of water and the pile of sandwiches . After a rousing dissertation on stowaways , he concluded : " Well , now you 're on board , I might as well take you on up to Los Angeles . " " Thank you , sir , " I said . S OON the mate came up and unchained me and looked over my passport . " Commercial artist , eh ? Can you do lettering ? " " Yes sir . I 've got some lettering brushes in my pack , too . " " Never mind the ' sir . ' My name is Jones . Think you could letter the ship 's name and paint the house flag on the bow and stern of all lifeboats ? " " I think so . " " OK . Get cleaned up and get some chow . Then get some paint from the bos'n and he 'll tell you where to start . " From that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life of Reilly . I was never wakened with the rest of my watch , which was routed out at 5:30 in the morning . I slept comfortably on the forward hatch cover until I awoke . Then I shaved , and had an enormous breakfast in the crew 's mess , no matter what time it was . I knocked off work when I felt like it , and three times a day I ate to the point of apoplexy , with snacks between . The work was easy . I roughed out the letters of Santa Elisa on both sides of the bow and stern of the double-ended lifeboats , and filled them in carefully with black paint . Then I painted a tiny Grace flag in red and green and white beside each name . The fascination which simple sign painting has for people ashore also works at sea : usually three or four passengers watched me work . They were very friendly . So was the crew . T T FIRST I even ventured a timid " Good morning , sir " to the Captain , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence . If it had not been for Drigo 's melodic , drippy " Serenade , " the Captain and I would never have had any further spiritual contact , I am sure . Somebody had been playing the syrupy melody on a phonograph in Puntarenasthe morning I stowed away , and it had been running through my head ever since . I whistled the blasted thing almost constantly , stopping fiercely every time I caught myself at it . The tune almost drove me crazy . One morning I was carefully drawing the brush round the curve of the s in Elisa , whistling softly , when I felt someone watching me with uncommon intensity . I turned my head and there stood the Captain craning over my shoulder , completely absorbed . He flushed , and whirled on his heel . He took a couple of long , quick steps , and then pulled himself down to a careless saunter . His back suggested that there was certainly no sign-painting in progress on his ship , and For all he knew or cared , not on this side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He wallowed through a couple of off-key bars of Drigo 's " Serenade " and then he must have realized where he 'd heard it . Silence heavy as an axe cut it cleanly in the middle of a note . The Captain stepped through a door and disappeared . I added the a to Elisa . I felt wonderful .
