His boss , according to an Ecuador legend , put him in charge of the petty-cash box . " Look , " he said . " On this page , the credit side , write down everything that comes in . On the other page , the debit side , write everything that goes out . " <P> At the end of the first day , young Velasco submitted his report . Two entries caught his boss 's eye . They were : " Credit : two nuns came in . " " Debit : ten sucres $4.87* went out . " <P> Now Velasco , high-minded and still " impractical , " is trying to revive his country , looted for centuries by " practical " rulers . But his view of financing has not changed .
