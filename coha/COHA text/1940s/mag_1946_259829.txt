A cluster of nuns settled among the spectators , and looked brightly around the old green and gilt hearing room . From the door , an aged Capitol policeman eyed them uneasily . The explosive Wagner-Murray-Dingell bill ( national health insurance* ) was up for another chewing by the Senate 's Education &; Labor Committee .

Murray , a wealthy New Dealer from Montana , be an to cuff critics who had called his $5 billion plan " communistic " and " socialistic , " Ohio 's arch-conservative Robert A. Taft fidgeted noticeably in his chair . Then , unable to stand it any longer , he rose . <P> " I think this bill is the most socialistic measure ever proposed seriously to the Congress , " said Republican Robert Taft . " This committee is being run as a propaganda machine . . . . " <P> " That 's a slander and a falsehood ! " roared Murray . " You 're just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> But Senator Taft would not down . Mildly he asked permission to announce his intention of submitting an opposition health bill . Murray rudely refused . Reddening , Taft demanded to be heard . <P> " I demand you subside , " cried Murray . " You 've been . . . impertinent arid insulting .

" <P> Senator Taft suggested that the meeting be adjourned until Murray had regained his temper . <P> " No , I wo n't adjourn . " <P> Taft swung toward the official reporter : " I hope you 're getting all this , because I intend to take it to the floor . " <P> <P> " Do n't take it down , " yelled Murray . <P> " You mean the chairman refuses to take down the statements I make ? " <P> Murray 's fist trembled aloft . " I 'm chairman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you do n't shut up I 'll get these officers in here to have you thrown out . " <P> Senator Taft preferred to walk out alone . Their civics lesson over , the nuns did likewise . <P> <P> * The Wagner-Murray-Dingell bill , introduced last November with President Truman 's blessing , but roundly damned by the American Medical Association , would be financed mainly by a 3% payroll tax on salaries up to $3,600 ( to be shared equally by employe and employer ) .
