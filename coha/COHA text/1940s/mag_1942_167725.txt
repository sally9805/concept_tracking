In the Balkans the struggle of guerrillas against occupying Axis troops grew hotter as the weather cleared . From Yugoslavia 's island of freedom ( TIME , May 25 ) came news last week that General Draja Mihailovich 's Army , now grown to a total of 200,000 men , had swooped down to attack Axis columns in Bosnia , then had retired again to craggy hideouts . In Croatia , deserters from Pavelich 's Axis-puppet army were forming " Green Cadres " to harass the German . At Metkovich , Dalmatia , guerrillas derailed an Italian troop train , brought Italian casualties in Yugoslavia to a total of 5,000 men in five months . <P> Meanwhile , in the harsh highlands of Greek Macedonia , a force of 15,000 men banded together , cut the short-cut railroad to the Russian front , via Bulgaria , in five places and attacked two Nazi troop trains , leaving 225 dead &; dying Germans . From crag tops they rolled huge boulders down into narrow bends , stopped traffic along the only motor road to Bulgaria . <P> For free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
