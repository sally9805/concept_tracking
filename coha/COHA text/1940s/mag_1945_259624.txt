THE ONE THAT GOT Mc CLOY - Helen AWAY-Helen William Morrow ( $2 ) . The aggressively erudite author of Panic has boned up this time on the ancient Picts , the psychology of juvenile delinquency and Poe 's Purloined Letter . She turns it all into a pretty exciting chase across the Scottish moors . When it 's all over , the critical reader may feel as trapped as the villain by the plot 's hard-to-believe major premise . Verdict : very good . <P> " RE : SHERLOCK HOLMES , " THE ADVENTURES OF SOLAR PONS - August Derleth-Mycroft &; Moron ( $2.50 ) . <P> This literary descendant of the Master deserves the nostalgic sighs his exploits will bring from most died-in-the-red Baker Street Irregulars . Readers who do not genuflect before No. 7 will note that Detective Pons shares his prototype 's shortcomings along with his virtues : his puzzles are n't always puzzling and his Dr. Watson is more ponderously thick headed than is absolutely necessary . Ver dict : good . <P> THE DEAD LIE STILL - William L.Stuart - Farrar &; Rinehart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a $30,000-a-year artist and a hard-drinking , indestructible private detective : " A big rough-look ing guy with dark hair .

Verdict : good . <P> THE DEVIL IN THE BUSH - Matthew Head - Simon &; Schuster ( $2 ) . On Hooper Taliaferro 's military mission into the Congo he stumbles across a marvelously carved ceremonial knife , two beautiful women and an evil old man . Un fortunately , this fine , assorted bag of jungle specimens includes one moth-eaten item : a thin , conventional plot of seduction and murder that has been used inumpteen whodunits with less glamorous settings . Verdict : fair . <P> THE WHISTLING LEGS - Roman McDougald - Simon &; Schuster ( $2 ) . The ingredients , are old , old stuff : the detective who leaves his bride on their wedding night , the client who suspects that the suicide is really murder , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guest and , finally , the newly invented explosive . But it is served up with such a flourish of fresh parsley that you 'd hardly recognize it as warmed-over hash . <P> Verdict : very good .
