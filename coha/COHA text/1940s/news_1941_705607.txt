txt Fitting Men for Service Approved Brig . Gen. Lewis B. Hershey , deputy director of Selective Service , stated that of about 1,000.000 men examined . 400,000 were found unfit for general military service . He said : " In the public interest they should be improved physically . * * * Probably one-third of these are suffering from disabilities directly or indirectly connected with nutrition . " In the enlistment for the whole of England and Wales the rate of rejection in 1936 was 48.2 per cent . Leslie HoreBelisha , then Secretary for War , observed : " My predecessor started a depot for training ; a limited number of men who are below standard and as a result of the food and training given them 576 of the 600 who joined the depot have reached the full standard of fitness . " Suggestions for the improvement of sub-standard cattle or hogs would meet with instantaneous warm response . But , since we deal here with human beings , the public , and the government , will view such suggestions with cold eyes . H. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
