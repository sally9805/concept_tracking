THE CITIES OF AMERICA KEY WEST By BENEDICT THIELEN You either like this town or you ca n't stand it . But you will have to admit that the place is gay  --  and noisy  --  with sound trucks , throbbing juke-box rumbas , roaring jalopies , illegal cockfights and Mr. Truman 's winter White House . KEY WEST is the only place in the United States where the breadfruit tree will grow , and its streets are shaded , not by elms and maples , but by the ilang-ilang from Guinea , the gumbo limbo from the West Indies and the bobug tree from the Philippines . An island two miles wide by four miles long , . the last in the long chain of the Florida Keys , it is 156 miles from Miami , but only ninety miles from Havana . Though technically it is outside the tropics , its climate  --  with an annual average temperature of 76.8 degrees  --  is tropical , and its physical appearance and atmosphere are Caribbean rather than continental American . Shut out the familiar chain drugstore and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the West Indies . This foreign quality , which is further emphasized by the fact that Spanish is heard on the streets almost as frequently as English , disconcerts some visitors . To hear a cop shouting at someone in Spanish in an American city does n't seem quite normal . To pick up a menu and , instead of the familiar ham and eggs or steak and French-fries , to be faced with a choice between bolichi roast and akaporado can be the cause of considerable mental anguish . The city acts as a kind of natural sieve which automatically sorts newcomers into those who like it and those who do n't . There seems to be no halfway measure . The ones who do n't like it hurry back in relief to the stucco bungalows and sanitary cafeterias of the mainland . The others stay on a while , and when they do leave , are determined to come back . They like the idea of Duval , the main street , running from the Atlantic to the Gulf of Mexico , and the carefully placed signs on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TRAFFIC . They do n't especially mind the fact that it is rather shabby and , like most of the city 's streets , badly paved . They are not shocked by the click of dice or the whir of the roulette wheel which comes from the back rooms of most of the city 's ninety-six bars . They are not disturbed by the sounds of revelry which issue from their open doors or the occasional crash of breaking glassware as some sailor is catapulted out onto the sidewalk . The whole question of noise , in fact , is important , for Key West is undoubtedly one of the most originally and gaily noisy of all cities . While the tax rolls show only fifty-seven registered juke boxes , it is estimated that there are at least 200 of these contrivances in operation . Windows are seldom closed , so that radios are heard to their best , or worst , advantage . The air throbs with rumbas and Cuban soap operas , productions which for intensity of emotion make our native products sound like restful bedtime stories by comparison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result that automobile mufflers , if they have not completely disintegrated , are riddled with holes . This makes the most humble jalopy roar like a supercharged racing car , a dramatic effect much beloved by the large Latin element in the population . Fenders in time assume a striking resemblance to old lace , and as the vehicles jolt along they often give the impression of being propelled by clashing wings . A popular form of advertising is the sound truck , which alternates snatches of rumbas or hillbilly music with announcements delivered in a volume that one generally associates with orders given from offshore for the invasion of an enemy beachhead . A favorite sport is cockfighting , and a great deal of challenging goes on between these birds over the fences that close in the back yards . Anything will grow in Key West ? " just stick it in the ground " is the usual answer to any horticultural inquiry  --  and the back yards are filled with every kind of exotic bloom from the familiar croton and hibiscus to such things as the match-me-if-you-can , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Monkey-fiddle cactus and the Dead-lady lily , also known as Moses-in-the-bathtub . One of the favorite places for the Dead-lady lily to grow is out of the cracks of the old cisterns which are found in every yard . Until the war , when the demands of the Navy required some other arrangement , Key West was dependent entirely for its water supply on rain gathered from the roofs and stored in these cisterns . Now , although there is plenty of water , brought by pipe line from Florida City , 125 miles away on the mainland , few people have thought it worth while to destroy them . You can never be sure what will happen to a pipe line , and there 's something comforting about the thought of those 5000 or 10,000 gallons out there . These cisterns would be wonderful mosquito breeders if it were n't for the fact that every now and then a man comes around with a pail from which he dumps a dozen or so small fish which live happily in the dark water and eat whatever mosquito larvae may form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's program of spraying with DDT , and the island , at one time a center of yellow fever , is now about as safe in this respect as it could be . Now and then one sees the once familiar striped wings and weakly fluttering flight of the Aedes aegypti , the carrier of this disease , but except for an occasional scorpion , there are few tropical pests and few diseases of the sort that one might expect to find in the nation 's southernmost city . This adjective , " southernmost , " is probably the most convenient and overworked word in the city 's vocabulary . Aside from its usefulness in naming commercial establishments , such as the Southernmost Florist and the Southernmost Drugstore , it lends itself to other applications as well . The Southernmost Hang-over has become almost a clich ? in Navy circles , and recently a discouraged winter resident was heard to mutter something about having the " southernmost stopped-up septic tank . " There is , of course , a Southernmost House , which for a time was the subject of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ornate Victorian structure at the foot of Duval Street , was so known and pointed out to tourists . Recently , however , a house was built next door which by actual survey is several feet farther south . The owner , quite naturally , resented the fact that habit prevailed over accuracy and the Harris House continued to be referred to by this distinctive title . After a somewhat acrimonious exchange of views , it was finally agreed that the new house was The Southernmost House , but that the former one , which has since changed hands , might legitimately be referred to as the Southernmost Rooming House . The cupolaed and gabled splendor of the ex-Southernmost House is an exception to the rule of simplicity and uniformity of style which otherwise characterizes the local architecture . For the most part , the houses have a distinct New England flavor , but New England adapted to the requirements of the tropics . Strongly built to withstand hurricanes , they are usually of white clapboard with second-story balconies , jalousied porches and aluminum-painted tin roofs . Many of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whaling captains ' houses of Nantucket . Key West has had a rich and varied history , and when you buy property here your title goes back to the grant " of all the tract of land called Cayo Hueso , or Key West , " by Don Juan Estrada , his Catholic majesty 's governor of East Florida , to Juan Sales in 1815 . Discovered 300 years before by Ponce de LeOn , the island probably remained uninhabited until about 1700 . Heaps of bones observed at that time and thought to be the result of a battle between Indians gave it its name of Cayo Hueso , or Bone Key , " which the English , " to quote an early settler , with the same facility which enabled them to transform the name of the wine , Xeres Seco , into ' Sherry Sack , ' corrupted into ' Key West . " In 1822 , after changing hands a number of times between the Spanish and the English , it became officially a part of the United States and in 1823 Commodore David Porter arrived here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pirates . Using small light-draft schooners and five twenty-oared barges which were towed by an old New York ferryboat , Porter eventually captured the last remaining buccaneers and opened the island to settlers . In those days there were no beacons to mark the reefs in these uncharted waters , and one of the earliest and most lucrative industries was the salvaging of cargoes from vessels that had run aground . In good years sales receipts ran up to $1,500,000 , and for a time the per-capita wealth of Key West was the highest of any city in the country . With the establishment in 1852 of a regular system of reef lights the salvaging industry declined , but other activities developed to take its place . Fishing flourished and the sponge industry was virtually a Key West monopoly . It was the time of the first Cuban movement for independence , and refugees and political plotters began to cross the Florida Strait in large numbers . With them came cigar factories , and the city 's population grew to 18,000 , making it the largest in the state . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours , half of it was wiped out by fire ; labor troubles followed , and a majority of the cigar manufacturers moved their enterprises to Tampa . This was a severe blow to the city 's economy , and although the Spanish-American War brought a temporary renewal of activity  --  it was from here that the U.S.S. Maine left for Havana on her last trip , and at one time the entire Atlantic fleet was stationed here  --  it was not until the completion in 1912 of Henry Flagler 's railway over the keys to Key West that the city again enjoyed true prosperity . As a result of this extraordinary engineering feat , which flung bridges over miles of open water at a cost of $50,000,000 and over 700 lives , car ferries were operated directly to Cuba , tourists came through the town in a steady stream and its population rose to 22,000 . The first World War brought back the Navy , Pan American inaugurated the first over-water international air service between Key West and Havana , and the city 's future seemed assured . But gradually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an adverse effect on business , and the nationwide depression made itself felt here as elsewhere . The city defaulted on payments of its bonds , officials ' salaries went unpaid and half of its then 12,000 inhabitants were eventually forced to go on relief . Finally , in July , 1934 , its affairs were turned over to the governor , and by him to the Florida Emergency Relief Administration . Recognizing the potentialities of Key West as a tourist center , the FERA emphasized this aspect in its program of rehabilitation . During the winter of 1934-35 some 40,000 tourists visited the island . Key Westers were just beginning to feet hopeful again when the disastrous Labor Day hurricane , one of the most violent on record , struck the Keys and demolished the railroad . For two and a half years Key West was virtually cut off from the outside world . The railroad was not rebuilt . Vehicular traffic was restricted to the few cars that could be crowded on the ferry which bumped for eight hours across the forty miles of shallow water separating the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was not until the opening of the Overseas Highway , in March , 1938 , that the city again began to get on its feet . Built on the old bridges of the railroad , the highway crosses twenty-nine miles of water , with one bridge extending for seven miles without touching land . Scenically , it is one of the most spectacular drives in the world . During the first year of its operation it was used by 417,000 persons and the number has increased yearly , with as many as 54,000 tourists driving over it in the month of January alone . Key Westers look on all this activity with mixed feelings . Of course , they say , it was pretty bad back there in ' 34 with everyone on relief and the Federal Government running things . But even so , nowadays everyone keeps hurrying . Sometimes you can walk a couple or three blocks without seeing anyone you know . Islanders are an independent lot . Like the Nantucket schoolboy , the Key Wester would be inclined to begin an essay on Napoleon by saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their isolation , and although the Overseas Highway ties the city to the mainland , there is a long tradition of self-sufficiency which colors the Key Wester 's reactions . Though some of his ancestors came here from Virginia and New England , the majority came from the Bahamas . Mostly Tories who had taken refuge there during the American Revolution , they , too , were islanders , by adoption if not by origin . They knew what they wanted , and it is their influence rather than that of the other colonists which persists in Key West today . Nicknamed " Conchs " because of their habit of eating the muscle of the queen-conch shell  --  a true delicacy , incidentally , which tastes like a cross between a scallop and an abalone  --  their descendants are still known by that name . The conch speech as one hears it in Key West today , particularly that of the older folk , is West Indian rather than American Southern , with that peculiar but pleasant lilt that one hears throughout the islands . In his soft-spoken way , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he liked it better when there were fewer of them , he never makes you feel that you are a nuisance . If you tell him you like Key West he is pleased , and he is always ready to take time off to talk about the city . There are any number of stories about his town which the Key Wester will tell you with quiet relish , but one of the first is sure to be the one about the body in the swimming pool . The story is simple . One day a body was discovered in a swimming pool . It was bound hand and foot , and a heavy weight was attached to it . After mature consideration , the authorities announced that in their opinion the cause of death was suicide . Case closed . That may be gruesome , but it is mild compared to the city 's real cause celebre , the Case of the Beautiful Girl and the Mad Scientist . Well , perhaps not mad , but certainly unconventional . Dr. Karl von Cosel , who is said to have come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was employed by the local marine hospital . To the hospital came a seventeen-year-old Cuban girl of unusual beauty named Maria . The doctor fell in love with her . This was during the depth of the depression , and since her family was practically destitute , he was in a position to help them financially and her medically . But despite all possible care , she died . The doctor obtained permission from her family to bury her . He built a handsome white mausoleum , equipped , in addition to the usual arrangements , with a chair and a radio . Here he spent much of his time . It had been his wish to have a telephone installed as well , but the telephone company , not having any precedent to follow in regard to such an application , refused . When he was not in the tomb , the doctor lived in what remained of an abandoned slaughterhouse . He had been discharged from the hospital and his present occupation was unknown . Glimpses had been had of an old airplane , and he had on occasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was generally felt that other activities than this were being pursued in that rather sinister dwelling . Eventually the building was condemned and he was forced to move . Laden with household goods , laboratory equipment and , as it eventually turned out , one additional more unusual item , the doctor 's plane was towed to his new place of residence . Seven years passed . Finally one day , a sister of the dead girl , returning after a long absence , went to the tomb and found it locked . Going to the doctor 's home , she asked him for the key , but was refused . Her suspicions aroused , she reported her experience to the authorities . That night three deputy sheriffs called on the doctor and found Maria in bed , dead , but considering the length of time she had been there , nicely preserved , dressed in white satin and wearing white kid gloves . Under questioning , the doctor stated that he had been trying to bring her back to life and was convinced that he could do so . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the statute of limitations he was not prosecuted . He was released on condition that he leave the county . He subsequently made a modest but adequate living selling picture post cards showing Maria under a Christmas tree , and last spring wrote a novelette based on his experiences and setting forth his theories , which appeared in one of the pulp magazines . All these doings are faithfully chronicled by the Key West Citizen , a remarkable publication with a circulation of 3500 , whose unique brand of journalism is the delight of visiting newspapermen and local residents as well . Speaking of the Citizen , a visitor once commented to a native Key Wester on the fact that there was no funny page in the paper . " It does n't need it , " the Key Wester replied . " It 's all funny . " After the intensity of contemporary life as it is lived elsewhere , there is something refreshing about this easygoing attitude . The tempo becomes calmer , and it has been suggested that Secretary Forrestal 's recent choice of Key West as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might finally iron out their differences showed a shrewd appreciation of the qualities of tolerance and relaxation which the local atmosphere induces . Perhaps , too , it is for this reason that ever since the days of Audubon and Winslow Homer so many artists and writers have found Key West to their taste . Although Ernest ( The Fisherman ) Hemingway has since departed , his house is still pointed out to sight-seers with , in the case of one guide , a lecture on the side about the moral vileness of Mr. H. 's book on Key West , To Have and Have Not . But many others either live here a good part of the year or make a practice of coming when they are able : Artists Arnold Blanch , Virginia Berresford , Adolf Dehn , Doris Lee ; Columnists Robert Allen and Elmer Davis ; Writers Max Eastman , Budd Schulberg , S. J. Perelman  --  to say nothing of those near neighbors and practitioners of the allied arts , Fan Dancer Sally Rand and Philosopher John Dewey . Key West was made art-conscious by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , brought in artists to decorate night clubs and public buildings , and established a municipal art center . One of the abandoned cigar factories on the outskirts of town now houses an art school . The majority of the students are ex-soldiers who work and live in the school , do their own cooking and sleep contentedly in a shambles of old iron cots , half-finished pictures and an all-pervading smell of linseed oil and turpentine . Whether or not it is true that Key Westers are so courteous because practically all of them , at some time or other , are running for office , it is certainly true that politics is one of the Chief interests of the town  --  for its sheer entertainment value , if for nothing else . In the Cuban coffee shops Where everyone drops in several times a day for a small cup of bitter black coffee , it is politics which is the subject of debate , occasionally cynical , frequently humorous and always impassioned . Up to a few years ago , the municipal government consisted of a mayor and Council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affair , with no outsiders standing much of a chance of getting in . In 1944 , however , a group of citizens formed a committee to frame a new charter , based on the model charter of the National Municipal League , and this was , though not without strong opposition , eventually adopted by the state legislature . As a result , Key West is now operating under a commission form of government with five members who , in turn , elect a mayor . There is a city manager . Elections are at large and not , as formerly , by Wards . Like all Southern towns , Key West really consists of two parts , the white and the colored . With the exception of small settlement near the cemetery , a Place which , because of its dizzy altitude of eight feet above sea level , is known as The Hill , most of the colored Population of 3000 live together in a section of tosen adjoining the naval base . " Jungle town " on a Saturday night rocks with music and gaiety , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bougainvillaea and the orange blaze of flame vines . It might be any street in Haiti or Jamaica and some of the spirit of those places has penetrated into its narrow lanes . From time to time one hears curious echoes in people 's conversations . A Boat has disappeared , but the owner declines to make any efforts to trace it . Dried onionskins have been found under someone 's front porch . Drums Were heard from a blue-shuttered house at the dark of the moon . In other words , voodoo . The goat , as is well known , is used in voodoo ceremonies , where the goat becomes the girl , and the girl the goat . One hesitates to inquire too closely into these matters . Shutters of a certain rather intense shade of blue are supposed to guard the house against evil spirits . Dried onionskins have magic powers , both for good and for evil . It may all be nonsense , but there are a lot of people , who , when they have to discharge their Cook , make a point of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want a fetish or a wanga bag , there is a small grocery store where you may leave Your order and fifty cents , and it will he ready for you in from half to three quarters of an hour , depending on the complexity of the purpose for which You need it . Of the industries which formerly brought wealth to Key West  --  sponge fishing and the manufacture of cigars  --  little survives . What there is is done on a small scale and is of no great economic importance . The city depends for its income for the most part on its tourist trade , the Navy and fishing . Few places can boast of as many varieties of fish as are to be found in these waters . More than 600 have been identified . There is everything from the lowly grunt , caught on a hand line , to the fighting sailfish and tarpon , as well as scores of such little-known but excellent species as the permit , the cobia , the wahoo , and the Kitty Mitchell . Commercially , the kingfish , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are probably the single most important catch . During the season , enormous quantities of them are brought in daily , the fishing boats staying ' out for several weeks at a time in the vicinity of Marquesas keys , west of Key West , and unloading their catch each night to the run boats which are sent out daily by the large fish companies . A boat operated by two men may bring in anywhere from 500 to 1500 pounds , which , at fourteen cents the pound , is not a bad day 's pay . Mackerel , mullet and yellowtails are also of considerable commercial importance , and the catching of crawfish , the clawless spiny Florida lobster , goes on for a large part of the year . Sharks are caught for their vitamin-rich livers and for their fins , which are dried in the Key West sun and then shipped to Chinese groceries . Every few months a trim two-masted schooner flying the red ensign of the British merchant marine stands into the main ship channel and docks at a local cannery . She has come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and is loaded with turtles which have been caught off the coast of Honduras . Here , their flippers tied with strips of raffia and looking rather helpless and unhappy , the turtles are transferred to " crawls , " or cages , in the water , where they await the time when they will be cut up into steaks or made into turtle soup . . There are all kinds of fish in the sea , but not all of them are to be taken on a rod and reel . Those other swift streaks of foam in the water are not made by a barracuda or an amber jack , but by a " tin fish " shot from the tube of one of the great fleet-type submarines . There are a dozen of these monsters , the last word in up-to-the-minute gadgets and , to the layman , bewildering complexity , stationed at the naval base . There are also two German submarines of the latest Mark 21 type . Of fine design and great speed , the Mark 21 's were equipped with the snorkel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water and enables the craft to take in a constant supply of fresh air . As a result , it can run submerged for tremendous distances , is much more difficult to spot by radar , and is to all intents and purposes immune to attack . It is this immunity to attack that is the reason for much of the naval activity here at the present time . Working in conjunction with submarines and surface craft from the Sonar School are planes from the Aircraft Development Squadron , the Night-Fighter Squadron and the Blimp Detachment stationed at near-by Boca Chica Field . Just what types of instruments or weapons are involved in this work is , of course , a secret , but it is no secret that the main emphasis is on ASW , or Antisubmarine Warfare . Activities with such engaging names as OpDevCen ? Operational Development Center ? and SurAsDevDet ? Surface Antisubmarine Development Detachment  --  enjoy a high priority as to both men and equipment , and there is a constant , quiet coming and going of civilian scientists between them and the research laboratories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testing of equipment are ideal . Planes are unhampered by fog , and only a few miles offshore there is deep water for the submarines to operate in . To anyone who remembers the early days of 1942 , there is a certain irony in the statement that conditions for submarines in these waters are ideal . During those first months of the war , when our Air Force and Navy were , to say the least , inadequate for the tasks they were called on to perform , the slow-moving tankers that entered the bottleneck of the Florida Strait were pathetically easy targets , and hardly a day passed without one and often as many as three or four being sent to the bottom .. Placed on an inactive status after the end of World War I , the old navy yard was reopened in 1939 and , as it became daily more apparent that war WAR inevitable , began to expand in all directions . Blocks of houses in the colored section adjoining the yard were razed . The docks of the old P. &; 0 . Steamship Company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Havana , were taken over . It was from here that the formation and movement of all convoys with their accompanying patrol craft and planes were directed . Two air stations and a naval hospital were built , and with the influx of construction workers and naval personnel the town presented the familiar wartime picture of bursting seams . No exact estimate of the population during this period is possible , but it is believed to have gone as high as 40,000 . With the war 's end , there was , of course , a sharp decline in the transient population . Certain naval activities were suspended , but in the case of others there was further expansion , and from all indications the Navy seems to be here to stay . While the enlisted men consider Key West a hick town and long for the glamour and sophistication of Miami , the officers seem pleased to be stationed here . There are some extremely plush quarters for the higher ranks , and for everyone there is that great naval institution , the party . This seems to flourish here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admirals  --  most of whom , oddly enough , appear for their inspections and conferences in January and February rather than during the summer months  --  must be entertained , and every arrival and departure of other officers is the signal for a round of parties of either welcome or farewell . " Key West , " a lifelong resident recently complained , " used to be a real party town . I do n't know what 's happened to it . " A rather tired-looking Navy wife who was present was observed to turn slightly pale at the thought . The Navy likes Key West , and Key West , despite occasional incidents involving exuberant sailors , likes the Navy . Indeed , if the Navy were again to move out , the effect on the local economy would be serious . There are approximately 7500 naval personnel , including dependents , stationed here at the present time , and 1000 civilian workers are employed in the various naval activities . The total monthly pay roll comes to $1,000,000 . With a population now of 20,000 as contrasted with 13,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 000 as against less than $28,000 , and bank deposits of $6,500,000 instead of only a little more than $1,000,000 , Key West is a prosperous community . But Key Westers are not drunk with sudden wealth . So far , no proud signs reading WATCH Us GROW have been erected to greet the entering motorist . No very drastic steps have been taken to correct the town clock , which every now and then , after the proper number of strokes , takes it into its head just to go on striking for a while anyway . No one gets very excited about the proposed new ferry to Cuba , except to point out that all those cars that would come pouring in would really clutter up Duval Street . ? Before the war there was a drugstore near the town 's four corners , which I used to patronize . When I returned here in the first winter after the war , it was no longer there . I assumed that it had gone out of business , but a few weeks later I happened to run across it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prominent location . After shaking hands with the proprietor , I said , " I thought you 'd decided to retire . " " No , " he said . " It just got so there was too darn much going on down there . The place was crowded all day long . " He glanced benignly at the two people seated at the soda fountain . " Out here it 's better . "
