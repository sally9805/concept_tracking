Winthrop Rockefeller , 28 , grandson of the late John D. , is big ( 6 ft. 2 in. ) , husky ( 215 lb. ) , moonfaced , affable . Like many a less wealthy American , he started college ( Yale ) , but did not finish . He worked as a roughneck in Texas oil fields , then got an office job with Socony-Vacuum Oil Co . In the draft lottery he drew an order number in the safe 6,000s . He liked his job all right , but , like many another young man of high &; low degree , he volunteered . <P> At 6:55 one morning last week , young Rockefeller left his Manhattan penthouse apartment to be inducted into the Army . Reporters were waiting on the sidewalk . At local draft-board headquarters Rockefeller stepped into an ambush of reporters , * cameramen , newsreel photographers , radio newscasters . Flashlight bulbs and questions popped all around him : what had he done the night before ( visited his parents ) , when had he gone to bed ( midnight ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when did he usually get up ( 8 or 8:30 ) , how much money did he have with him ( " just pocket change " ) , did he like beans ( yes ) , would he mind wearing long Army underwear ( no ) . <P> Not to be outdone , the draft-board chairman told newsmen he had " special confidence in Mr. Rockefeller 's integrity and ability , " named him to lead a contingent of 30 men on a subway ride to the induction centre . Rockefeller squirmed , carefully refrained from giving any orders . Photographers went with him in the subway , shot pictures during the ride . When he got out , three newsreel trucks were waiting to catch him lugging his suitcase for the remaining three blocks . Sweat began to drip from his face , wilted his collar , stained his necktie . <P> Through Rockefeller 's physical examination and record taking at the induction centre , the reporters followed . Typists stared and giggled until an officer ordered them to get to work . When Private Rockefeller was sworn in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why the hell do n't they let the poor fellow alone ? " But the newsmen stayed right with him - to the platform of the train on which he and 441 other privates rode off to camp . <P> Before the train pulled out , he dumped his bag in a seat , took a long drink of water , mopped his forehead . At Fort Dix reporters were waiting again . He posed for more pictures , answered more questions . <P> At 10:45 that night Private Rockefeller piled wearily into his bunk in a tent with five other soldiers . Having got through that needle 's eye , he may well have reflected , the rest of the year 's training would be , comparatively , heaven . <P> Last week other young U. S. citizens joined the Army by the thousand . Of those who were drafted , some were keen to go , some were reluctant . <P> &gt; National Guardsman John Shea , 23 , who had never been to a dentist in his life and showed it , was rejected by Army physicians in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dentist 's office , held his mouth open for ten and a half hours while the dentist drilled and filled . Out came three teeth ; in went two bridges , four fillings , five crowns . Next day jaw-sore Patient Shea smiled a false-toothy smile for Army physicians , jumped happily on the train that took his outfit to camp .
