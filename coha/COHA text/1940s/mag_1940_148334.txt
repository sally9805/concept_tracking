To men on little tossing trawlers in the raw North Sea , who can scarcely defend themselves with rifles when Nazi bombers dive at them from the storm scud , Germany 's air war on British shipping is a very real and horrid thing . Machine-gun fire sweeps the deck , bombs blow the ship apart , men are hurled mangled and stunned into the combers , the ship goes down leaving survivors to flounder and gasp and freeze until help comes , if it does . <P> But the fact remained last week , after more German air raids over the North Sea , one of which ended with a lone Heinkel bomber being brought down like a shot duck near the mouth of the Firth of Forth , that Germany 's winter campaign of harassment affects the mass of Britain 's shipping about as much as a woodpecker tapping on a bank vault . Because of the small bombs used and the difficulty of sighting for enough lethal hits , most of the ships claimed as " sunk " by Nazi pilots are only damaged . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blankets . Of eight ships claimed by Nazis in one day last week , the British admitted the actual loss of only two , one of them shattered by a torpedo launched from the air . <P> &gt; When an enemy submarine is sunk , the British Admiralty usually delays announcement of it , to withhold information and increase worry for the German High Command . Last week the Admiralty departed from this custom , announced the sinking in one day of two U-boats by one British destroyer . Emphasized-to encourage neutrals-was the fact that these U-boats had attacked a convoy off Ireland . Additional fact : they sank at least one of the convoyed ships ( the Canadian Beaverburn ) . And another ship , the Chagres , was lost to a mine . <P> &gt; Again last week Berlin and London engaged in a claiming argument about total merchant tonnage sunk since September . Berlin claimed 409 victims , Allied and neutral , totaling 1,493,431 tons . London reported that the real figures were 274 ships , 925,044 tons . Lloyd 's Shipping Gazette appeared to umpire the debate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 281 Allied and neutral ships of 977,790 tons .
