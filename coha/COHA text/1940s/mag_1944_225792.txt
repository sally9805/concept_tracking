The first really readable , authoritative English translation of one of the world 's oldest and greatest religious classics was published last fortnight . It is The Bhagavad Gita ( The Song of the Lord ) , often called the Hindu New Testament , translated by Swami Nikhilananda ( Rama-krishna-Vivekananda Center , New York ; $3 ) . Also published , without the profuse notes and comments of the larger volume , was a $2 pocket-size edition of the Glta 's text ( " for daily devotional study . . . very convenient when traveling " ) . <P> Says Harvard 's Professor Emeritus of Philosophy , William Ernest Hocking ( Contemporary Science and the Idea of God ) in his foreword : " May this majestic poem find its way into the familiar literary friendship of many readers , and contribute to the sense of spiritual kinship with the most gifted people of Asia , akin to us both in blood and language . " <P> The Gita is daily spiritual reading for millions of Hindus , from man-in-the-street to monk . It forms a part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gita comprises 18 chapters of the Mahabharata , takes the form of a dialogue between Sri Krishna , also a manifestation of God , and Arjuna , an Indian prince . <P> Arjuna and Krishna . The Gita is just as timely as it was 2,000 years ago , for it opens with the problem of the righteous man 's attitude toward war . Drawn up on the historic plain of Kurukshetra , on chariots , elephants , horses and afoot , were thousands of Indian warriors . They had assembled to fight a battle to decide who should rule a kingdom . Arjuna was the rightful contender , and Krishna , in person , was with him on the vast plain . <P> The sight of the armies made Arjuna weep . It was senseless ( and sinful ) that so many men should die for his earthly glory . To Krishna , Arjuna recited the evils of war as they have always been known to men who have always made wars . " O Krishna , " he cried , " at the sight of these my kinsmen assembled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mouth is parched . . . . I desire neither victory nor empire nor even any pleasure . . . . I would not kill though they should kill me . . . . Far better would it be for me if they should slay me in the battle unarmed and unresisting . " <P> The Unreal Never Is . Krishna knew that Arjuna 's confusion arose from his failure to discriminate between the Real and the unreal , Spirit and matter , Soul and body . Said Krishna : " The unreal never is . The Real never ceases to be . . . . None can cause the destruction of that which is immutable . Only the bodies of which this eternal , imperishable , incomprehensible Self is the indweller , are said to have an end . Fight , therefore . . . . He who looks on the Self as the slayer , and he who looks on the Self as the slain-neither of these apprehends aright . The Self slays not , nor is slain . It is never born nor does It ever die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cease to be . Unborn , eternal , permanent , and primeval , It is not slain when the body is slain . . . . "
