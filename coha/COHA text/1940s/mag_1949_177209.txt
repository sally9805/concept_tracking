As she does each year at the Spring Festivals , a beauty queen last week took up her reign in Mexico City . Titian-haired Luz del Carmen ( " Moy " ) Otero rode into the bullfight ring at the head of a 16-car cavalcade , presided at horse races , and went to a ball every night . Moy had a fine time and so did her father , suave General Ignacio Otero , commandant of the First Military Zone . Moy owed it all to Daddy . <P> As the spring festivals approached , Mexico City had had a rash of queen elections . Oilworkers , government clerks , sportsmen and the " proletarian districts " all elected their own queens , and crowned them at special fiestas . The press photographers got Cantinflas , Mexico 's most popular comedian , to crown their queen ( see cut ) . Moy ran as the army 's candidate for queen of all the festivals . Her nearest competitor was sultry , dark-haired Yolanda Ortiz , candidate of the traffic cops ( the police department had its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were running a close race , but that Moy was ahead . <P> The margin , thought the police , was close enough to try for an upset ; they rushed election headquarters with a big batch of last-minute votes for Yolanda . But when they arrived , said the police , canny General Otero 's troops had got there first , with arms instead of votes . His soldiers bluntly told the police that the polls were closed . <P> Though the policemen demanded a recount , General Otero was unmoved . He denied the whole incident and saw to it that his daughter was crowned . " Mexicans , " he explained , " do not know how to lose . " But General Otero knew how a winner should act . To appease his daughter 's competitors-all princesses of the festivals-he invited them to a gala luncheon . As Moy and her princesses plunged into a week of parties , even the traffic police forgot about the squabble.                    @
