WAR PROPAGANDA AND THE UNITED STATES-Harold Lavine &; JamesWechsler- Yale ( $2.75 ) . <P> A spectre haunts the U. S.-the spectre of propaganda . Authors Harold Lavine ( of the Institute for Propaganda Analysis ) and James Wechsler have seen the ghost , and they believe it is going to get us into war if we do n't watch out . They have been watching out for some time . Last fortnight they published their observations in War Propaganda and the United States , a slickly written , epigrammatic , rather loosely organized book , in which the authors , with a great show of objectivity , attempt to expose the efforts of European propagandists to embroil the U. S. in World Wars I &; II . It was sure to be read with interest by anxious Americans , startled by the Allied debacle , fearful of the future , above all fearful of being led by their noses . <P> Sometimes the propaganda spook speaks German , sometimes it speaks French . But it is the spectre with a British accent that scares Authors Lavine &; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as , on the whole , inept and ineffective . But they feel that British propaganda is not just another name for Empire publicity . It is a force dark , sinister , pervasive , ineluctable . Its strength lies in the fascination which the British upper classes exert upon the U. S. upper classes . As proof they submit a somewhat original interpretation of Anglo-American relations before 1917 . During World War I , they claim , there was a deep cleavage in U. S. sentiment : " To upper-class America , the Allies truly represented civilization , for England 's culture was their culture too . " So the upper classes foisted World War I on the rest of the U. S. " The string quartet played dinner music as upper-class America marched to war . " <P> Authors Lavine &; Wechsler feel that the only way for Americans to avoid the charms of British dinner music in World War II is to scrutinize every organ of authority and opinion , including the President of the U.S. , for propaganda pollution . Most of their book consists of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly the British , is , of course , propaganda . <P> War Propaganda and the United States is a pretty good job of isolationist propaganda itself .
