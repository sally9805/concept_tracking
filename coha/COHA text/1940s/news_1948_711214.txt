txt General of the Army Dwight D. misenhower took his farewell salute from the Army yesterday at Fort Myer , Va . A few hours later , at 4:35 P. M. , he stepped from his car here to enter his new ' residence , President 's House of Coluirbia University , 60 Morningside Drive . He was in uniform , with the SHAM ' patch on his left shoulder , but he was taking the first step into civilian life . On June 7 he will be installed as president of the university . A group of 200 persons , mostly residents of the neighborhood , among them many children , had been awaiting his arrival for a couple of hours . When the General stepped from his car , a broad grin on his face , they swarmed around it crying : ** " Welcome to Morningside , Ike ! " Mrs. Eisenhower left the car a moment later carrying a large bouquet of yellow roses , the parting gift of the regiment at Fort Myer . With Mrs. Eisenhower at his side the General stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold braid of a general officer , while the crowd jostled and elbowed each other and the photographers to get closer . It was an intimate greeting and a quiet one in contrast to the boisterous reception he received when he came up Broadway in 1945 in the victory parade . Squirming through the legs of adults , 9-year-old David Syrett reached a position next to the General , who extended his hand . David put forth a play-begrimed hand and then shuffled in embarrassment as the photographers yelled " Hold it . " The lad fidgeted and twisted and turned his face to look for escape . General Eisenhower smiled down and said , " Look up at me ; we 're supposed to be talking , " and he added , " Boy , wait till you see yourself in the movies . " Then the man who had commanded more troops // than any other generallin history said , " We 'll have to have a girl in this too , " and reached out to shake hands with Rachel Rosenfarb , 8 , of 400 West 119th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green sweater , blue dungarees and scuffed shoes , had been playing soldier and carried a toy tommy gun . He is the son of Harold C. Syrett , Assistant Professor of History at Columbia , and lives at 401 West 118th Street . He is a ' fourth grader at Horace Mann-Lincoln school . While the General was waving his hat and repeating his salutes to the crowd in response to pleas from the photographers , Mrs. Eisenhower was gazing with interest at her new home . They moved to the entrance and again had to halt for more pictures . At the doorway General Eisenhower spotted a soldier and greeted him cordially . The General noticed the soldier 's shoulder patch and said : " That 's the outfit my son was with . Did you go overseas with them ? " The soldier , Pvt . Paul Ritter , a patient at Valley Forge ( Pa . ) General Hospital who was in New York on a weekend pass , said that he had joined the unit in April , 1945 . He remarked afterward that he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Main airport . General Eisenhower declined to be interviewed , reserving that for today . He said the trip from Fort Myer had been " most enjoyable , " and confessed that they had driven across George Washington Bridge because they did not want to risk downtown New York traffic . He and Mrs. Eisenhower were accompanied by Major Craig Cannon , an aide , and were driven by Master Sgt. Leonard Dry , who had been the General 's driver for six years . The party stopped for a picnic lunch shortly before the Newcastle-Pennsville ferry crossing to New Jersey . General - Eisenhower 's departure from Washington was ' a ' quiet one . His leave-taking from the old Fort Myer cavalry post and quarters No. 1 was within the Army family . Washington was unaware of his leave-taking . General Omar N. Bradley , who succeeded him as Chief of Staff , and who will now move into Quarters No. 1 , was on hand and the troops of the famous Third Infantry Regiment , created by the first Continental Congress , lined the Fort 's main street . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eisenhower said on his arrival here . When the General came to the door at the Fort there awaited a detachment of ceremonial troops , a band , armored cars and the colors . " Present . . . Arms ! " rang out and gloved hands slapped hard on rifles as the detachment came to salute . For thirty-seven years General Eisenhower had heard that command and sound , from ' cadet to five-star general . He snapped a crisp salute , grinned , and stepped into the car with Mrs. Eisenhower and was on the road to civilian life . The band rendered " Ruffles and Flourishes , " and an infantryman handed Mrs. Eisenhower a bouquet of roses . They rode in an open car ' to the gate of the Fort and then transferred to the closed car that brought them to New York .
