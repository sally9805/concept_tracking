Like a mother fretting over a willful child 's diet , beagle-eyed Dr. Morris Fishbein , editor of the American Medical Association Journal , keeps a sharp watch over the nation 's food &; drug habits . Last fortnight Dr. Fishbein was worrying about mineral oil , of all things . <P> For years , doctors have been recommending mineral oil for constipation and in weight-reducing diets . Because of animal and vegetable fat shortages , it has also been widely used in salad dressings . What worries Dr. Fishbein : recent research seems to prove that a steady diet of mineral oil is none too good for the human organism . <P> One study showed that three teaspoons of mineral oil a day cuts in half the human body 's ability to absorb carotene , which is converted to vitamin A. Vitamin A deficiency causes night blindness , various skin and internal disorders . What 's more alarming , fine droplets of mineral oil can go through the intestinal wall and reach the liver and lymph nodes , where , doctors suspect , they may cause dangerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tissues . <P> In the opinion of no less an authority than Dr. Walter C. Alvarez , famed Mayo Clinic internist , doctors should take a long , suspicious look at mineral oil . Said Fishbein , quoting Alvarez : " These observations raise the grave question . . . whether mineral oil can be used safely , year in and year out , as some persons use it ; they also raise the question whether purveyors of food should ever be allowed to substitute mineral oil for the edible fats .
