All last week the British First Army , bolstered by U.S. and French units , continued its slow , careful advance . Steadily Lieut . General Kenneth A. N. Anderson 's troops edged over the steep ridges of the Atlas Mountains . At week 's end they were twelve miles from Tunis . The decisive battle for North Africa was imminent . <P> Weather had delayed the Allies . Tunisia 's brief rainy season had flooded roads , complicated supply problems . But worse than the rain in Africa 's grey skies were Axis planes that pummeled Anderson 's forward columns , pounded his bases at Bougie and Bone , trying to disrupt his communications . Only scraps of information came from General Dwight Eisenhower 's headquarters , but it was apparent that the battle of Tunisia so far had been a struggle for control of the air . <P> In the beginning the Axis had the edge . Hitler had poured in air strength . His African air chief , Air Field Marshal Erhard Milch , had the advantage of air bases close to the fighting front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; bombers roared from Sicily and Sardinia and from the little island of Pantelleria in the straits . The farther the First Army advanced , the more vulnerable it became to Milch 's stings . <P> But apparently the scales were being slowly tipped . Algeria-based bombers of Major General Jimmy Doolittle 's 12th Air Force blasted Axis fields , crippling Axis fighter operations by bombing their nests . From Libya and from the island of Malta came other Allied bombers . Fighter bases were improvised in the rear of the rolling First Army , and from these , in swelling numbers , Spitfires rose to mix with swooping Axis dive-bombers . <P> Hitler had capitalized on his temporary advantage to rush more troops to the aid of his Tunisian commander , Major General Walther Nehring . Some of them were transported by huge Ju-528 , which Allied planes chased and harassed . Many of them poured in from ships that made the short dash from Sicily . The British Admiralty announced that British subs sank nine of these vessels : tankers and cargo carriers laden with tanks , guns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the rate of two a day . Estimates were that Nehring 's force now numbered between 20,000 and 30,000 men . <P> Nehring had extended his slender fingerhold down the coast to Sfax and Gabs . But his biggest concentration was inside the ring around Bizerte and Tunis . <P> Somewhere in Algeria , Ike Eisenhower , Admiral Sir Andrew Cunningham and Major General James Doolittle conferred with Sir Arthur William Tedder , R.A.F. chief in the Middle East , * and Major General Lewis Brereton , chief of U.S. Middle East air forces . Tedder and Brereton had flown in from Egypt . The moment Tunis was cleared , the trap would probably be sprung on Rommel.
