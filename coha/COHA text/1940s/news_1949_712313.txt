txt An official threat to call out every longshoreman in ports from Maine to Virginia Was issued yesterday by Joseph P. Ryan , president of the International Longshoremen 's Association , AFL . An indignant wage negotiating committee of the union 's eastern locals , numbering 120 men , held a meeting at the Atlantic Coast District headquarters , 164 Eleventh Avenue , yesterday and voted to reject counter-proposals made to the union on Thursday by the New York Shipping Association . The association , the official bargaining group for employer stevedors , had stunned the ILA committee by re questing a 13-cent wage reduction . Yesterday 's meeting of the ILA group was followed by a statement from Mr. Ryan recalling the union 's loyalty , and describing the offer as an insult . 22-Cent Increase Asked The union had demanded a wage increase of 22 cents an hour . The present wage rate for straight time is $1.88 an hour , and the employers want to roll back the rate to $1.75 , where it was in the fall of 1948 when the AFL union 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase was won under Federal mediation . The current increase demand would place the straight time scale at $2.10 and overtime at $3.15 . A canvass of the shipping industry yesterday disclosed an apparent determination to hold out , even in the face of a strike , for no increase . Some leaders in the industry said they intended to hold out for the reduction . Others , however , admitted that the demand for a 13-cent reduction was a bargaining position , and they indicated that both the companies and the union were expected to make concessions in meetings scheduled before the strike deadline of Sept. 30 . The current contract expires ink that date , and it was considered inevitable that . the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service would enter the negotiations a week before the deadline , and perhaps earlier . To Stand by Demands Mr. Ryan said at noon , after the wage meeting broke up , that the committee vote on rejecting the shipping association counter-offer was " unanimous " and that " we voted to stick to our original demands . " The ILA committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M. next Tuesday . " We note , " Mr. Ryan said , " the employers ' statement of yesterday regarding conditions in the industry . They talk about what they have given to us  --  four wage increases  --  but they forgot that . we had to go on strike and into arbitration two of those four times to get what we got . " That was in 1945 and 1948 . It is an insult for them to expect us to take that kind of proposition , considering the loyalty , the cooperation and the production we have given to the industry . " Industry spokesmen retorted that " the dock men are too sensitive . " One leading member of the employer negotiating committee pointed out that the industry had not been insulted when the MA. made wage demands last year . " We were pinched , but we were n't insulted , " he said . The union men were particularly upset by the fact that ILA had been the first in a major industry to be " singled out for a reduction . " Mr. Ryan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are ready to stop work on the 30th of September ; that 's how ready we are , " he replied . See Contract Extended Shipping men , not discounting the threat of a costly walkout at a time when the industry is already plagued with rapidly declining revenues and decreasing cargo , believed that Federal mediation officers would be conducting the negotiations by the third week in the month and that the current contract would be extended by perContinued haps another month if a settlement was not reached by the deadline . Although wage demands are the principal point in the dispute , a number of other union requests were rejected by the shipping group for reasons of cost . The union , . had asked for larger work gangs , limited sling loads , an improved welfare plan , a , corapany-supported pension system and extended pay guarantees . The number of men that would respond to the September strike call is a matter of disagreement . ILA membership estimates vary widely and depend also on whether total membership or active working figures are involved . The union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ports , but this would include hundreds , and perhaps several thousands , who are casual workers , repairing to the docks only for occasional extra money . There are about 45,000 cardholding members in the New York area but it kas been estimated that only 25,000 could be called regular workers . In demands made on the ILA recently for a reduction in its membership , it was officially reported that 31,000 men in the New York area had worked 1,100 hours or less during 1948 . Whatever the figure , there is no doubt of tile . ? linty of the union to paralyze shipping on the East Coast , shipping men admitted . Cyrus S. Ching , head of the Federal Mediation and ' Conciliation Service , is expected in New York next week for the beginning of efforts to settle the long-standing Hawaiian dock strike , involving members of the International Longshoremen 's and Warehousemen 's Union , CIO , led by Harry Bridges . The choice of New York fo- this proceeding has been a matter of speculation in the industry here . Shipping nilii said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York regional . office might move directly from the Hawaiian question into the New York dispute . He spearheaded the settlement of the ILA-New York Shipping Association dispute and strike last year. , That was the ILA 's first " official " strike .
