In Santiago , Chile , a deaf woman in the jampacked audience at the Teatro Central had trouble following the ceremony on the stage . She turned to her husband , asked why the American nurse was getting a medal : " Because she had 8,000 babies , " he answered . " Impossible ! " gasped his wife . <P> But that was what the speakers had said and in a sense it was true .

Top Chilean doctors and obstetricians give their services free . Marie Schultze herself gets less than $1,200 a year , lives in a small apartment behind the clinic . Her reward : " The satisfaction I feel when I know I have had a vital part in saving some life . " <P> Despite its Presbyterian tie , Marie Schultze has taken her clinic far above sect . Mothers in the 100% Catholic neighborhood never balk at going to the Protestant clinic . All but one of her doctors are Catholic , and when good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the introductory speech . <P> Today Marie Schultze dreams of the time when she can build a big maternity hospital and nurses ' training school . The plans are drawn . She is trying to raise the money , peso by peso . Of her dream she says : " I pray again as these new ideas unfold before me that I may be used wherever and however He would have me , and that I may have an open mind and heart to hear His voice .
