The North Pole is a strategic hotspot . Over the ice-capped roof of the world run the shortest air routes from Russia to the U.S. Last week , the general public learned for the first time that Russia is interested in Norway 's bleak Spitsbergen archipelago , within the Arctic Circle ( Spitsbergen to Pittsburgh : 3,500 miles ) . <P> In November 1944 , Russia first asked Norway to share Spitsbergen with the Soviet Union , and to cede neighboring Bear Island outright . Trygve Lie , then Norway 's Foreign Minister , refused . In April 1945 , Russia tried again , suggested a joint regional defense system . Nothing came of that , either . At the U.N . Assembly last November , Foreign Minister Molotov reminded Norway 's Foreign Minister Halvard M. Lange that Russia was still interested . <P> When the Spitsbergen story finally reached the press last week , it sent cold shivers down many a diplomatic spine . The State Department frigidly recalled that the 1920 treaty giving Spitsbergen and Bear Island to Norway had been signed by 30 nations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amended ( at least in theory ) except by general consent . The treaty specifically prohibited military installations on the islands .
