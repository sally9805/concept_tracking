Congress lowering of the draft age to 18 cleared the college air . College officials , who had decided that any policy , however tough , was better than no policy , applauded . If the youth draft did not settle the wartime fate of the 1,700 U.S. colleges ( enrollment : about 1,120,000 ) , it set the stage for a settlement . Cleared up was the question : who would go to college-only men in uniform and the physically unfit . A battle over a big remaining question began behind closed doors in Washington : Who would run the colleges , the Army &; Navy or civilians ? <P> The Army &; Navy wanted to take over the colleges lock , stock &; barrel. * They proposed to pick the students and prescribe their courses , eliminate everything from the curriculum but technical and essential professional studies . <P> College officials were just as determined to keep control . The leaders of the American Council on Education had agreed on a plan : Let military authorities and the colleges jointly pick from the nation 's ablest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limited by military quotas . Each enlistee , put into uniform and provided with base pay and a living allowance , would choose his own college , there get four semesters ( about a year and a half ) of basic officer training under R.O.T.C. or college teachers . After that , picked men would stay in college for advanced professional or technical training , the rest would go directly into the armed forces . <P> Author of this plan was Harvard 's President James Bryant Conant . President Conant and a fellow member of the three-man committee that had cleared up the rubber mess , M.I.T. 's President Karl Compton , joined in warning the nation that it could no longer delay clearing up its college manpower mess . Taking issue with Army men who had declared that all students were destined for the armed forces , they pointed to the urgent need for experts in war industry . Said President Compton : " My own experience with the scientific program of the Government and the technical problems of the services and of industry convinces me that cutting off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calamity . " <P> While men 's colleges faced a great decision , women 's colleges also began to realize last week that they had come to a fork in the road . Urging a national service act for women , the American Council on Education 's President George Zook said : " It is clear that women students can not expect to pursue college as usual while their brothers and male friends are rushed off . . . . Courses for women are going to be shortened and they are going to be directed toward preparation for specific types of war service . . . . These war jobs are going to appear to college women to be hard and distasteful . Stronger words could be used for what many of the men are going through . " <P> * College presidents heard disquieting reports that the Army &; Navy planned to use fewer than 500 of the 1,700 colleges ; the rest might have to give up for the duration .                   @ @
