Knut Hamsun , 83 , No. 1 Norwegian novelist and No. 1 intellectual pro-Nazi , had always bruised easily . So when Norwegians heard that he had suffered a stroke , some thought they knew the reason . For years his countrymen had loved his books ( Hunger , Growth of the Soil , The Road Leads On ) . But now those books , which had once nudged bibles on Norwegian bookshelves , were boycotted ; dog-eared copies were even trickling back to Hamsun at Grimstad . Last week , though Hamsun had since recovered from his stroke , the trickle of books swelled to a river . Though the local post office hired extra help , they still could not deliver all the thousands of Hamsun volumes winging home to roost . Grim-faced citizens volunteered to help deliver them : they carted the books to his farm and dumped them at Hamsun 's door . Last week , at an auction in Oslo , a 20-volume first edition of Hamsun 's collected works came up for bidding . A blunt silence fell . When a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent ) , another , to pacify the auctioneer , bid one crown ( about 25 ) , won the edition and promptly mailed it back to its author . <P> When Hamsun , first showed sympathy with the Nazis in 1933 , Norwegians cared little . But it was different when the Nazis invaded Norway and Hamsun told his countrymen : " Norwegians ! Throw away your rifles and return home . The Germans are fighting for us and now are crushing England 's tyranny over us and all neutrals . " In Washington the Norwegian Minister , Wilhelm Munthe de Morgenstierne , doubted that Hamsun had said this . If he had , said Minister de Morgenstierne , " I am inclined to credit it to a very old man 's tiredness and anguish . " <P> But it was true . He who had worn black for anarchists hanged after the Haymarket riots , * and who chiefly wrote of simple peasant lives , had ranged himself beside the Gestapo . To the big , white country house which success had brought him , after harsh years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kelp , of grass and Norwegian earth . Outside the maples whisper . But in the house , now crammed with a painful store of books , the man who always loved solitude had won it , at last , in bitter measure . <P> *When Hamsun worked in Chicago as a streetcar conductor .
