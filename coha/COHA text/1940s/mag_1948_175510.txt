Phil Murray did not like to see his scrappy brood of C.I.O. kids kick each other around . But Papa Phil could not have been very displeased at some of last week 's infighting . Some of the C.I.O. 's Red-eyed bully boys-whom he does not like-were getting their lumps . <P> The Communist-cored Greater New York C.I.O. Council , which was noisily defying Murray 's edict against backing Henry Wallace , took a stiff right hook from Michael J. Quill , boss of the C.I.O. Transport Workers Union . Tough Mike , heeding Murray 's gospel , quit as president of the council , and advised New York City 's 42,000 subway workers and bus drivers to have nothing more to do with it . <P> That did not mean that Quill , one of labor 's most devoted followers of the far-left line , had been converted all the way over to the right . But it did mean that Quill had put trade unionism ahead of politics and would be on Phil Murray 's side if a showdown with the C.I.O. 's Communist-liners developed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Murray 's unspoken sympathy in another fight . Last week the United Electrical , Radio and Machine Workers , the biggest Communist-wired union of all , cried out for Murray to do something about " raids " on its membership by right-winger Walter Reuther 's United Automobile Workers . A fortnight ago two large U.E. locals ( about 4,500 members ) in Hartford , Conn. , voted overwhelmingly to secede from the U.E. and join a new U.A.W. local . Their reason : long feuding between the locals ' non-Communist leaders and the U.E. 's top bosses . <P> All that Murray did about it was to issue a perfunctory statement that raiding could never be condoned . That , of course , was meant to be a warning slap against any such shenanigans within the family . But to many a C.I.O. man it seemed more like a soft-gloved pat of encouragement for Walter Reuther.
