Murray Heyert , who has written articles and fiction for various periodicals , contributes this story of his native New York . THE NEW KID A Story MURRAY HEYERT B Y the time Marty ran up the stairs , past the dentist 's office , where it smelled like the time his father was in the hospital , past the fresh paint smell , where the new kid lived , past the garlic smell from the Italians in 2D ; and waited for Mommer to open the door ; and threw his schoolbooks on top of the old newspapers that were piled on the sewing machine in the hail ; and drank his glass of milk ( " How many times must I tell you not to gulp ! Are you going to stop gulping like that or must I smack your face ! " ) ; and set the empty glass in the sink under the faucet ; and changed into his brown keds ; and put trees into his school shoes ( " How many times must I talk to you I God in Heaven ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not make me follow you around like this ! " ) ; and ran downstairs again , past the garlic and the paint and the hospital smells ; by the time he got into the street and looked breathlessly around him , it was too late . The fellows were all out there , all ready for a game , and just waiting for Eddie Deakes to finish chalking a base against the curb . Running up the street with all his might , Marty could see that the game would start any minute now . Out in the gutter Paulie Dahler was tossing high ones to Ray-Ray Stickerling , whose father was a bus driver and sometimes gave the fellowstransfers so they could ride free ; The rest were sitting on the curb , waiting for Eddie to finish making the base and listening to Gelberg , who was a Jew , explain what it meant to be bar-mitzvah 'd , like he was going to be next month . rrHEY did not look up as Marty galloped up to them all out of breath . Eddie finished making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with his head on one side , moved down toward the sewer that was home plate and began drawing a scoreboard alongside it . With his nose running from excitement Marty trotted over to him . " Just going to play with two bases ? " he said , wiping his nose on the sleeve of his lumber jacket , and hoping with all his might that Eddie would think he had been there all the while and was waiting for a game like all the other fellows . Eddie raised his head and saw that it was Marty . He gave Marty a shove . " Why do n't you watch where you 're walking ? " he said . " Ca n't you see I 'm making a scoreboard ! " He bent over again and with his chalk repaired the lines that Marty had smudged with his sneakers : Marty hopped around alongside him , taking care to keep his feet off the chalked box . " Gim me a game , Eddie ? " he said . " What are you asking me for ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't my game . " " Aw , come on , Eddie . I 'll get even on you ! " Marty said . " Ask Gelberg . It 's his game , " Eddie said , straightening himself and shoving his chalk into his pants pocket . He trotted suddenly into the middle of the street and ran sideways a few feet . " Here go ! " he hollered . " All the way ! " From his place up near the corner Paulie Dahler heaved the ball high into the air , higher than the telephone wires . Eddie took a step back , then a step forward , then back again , and got under it . Marty bent his knees like a catcher , pounded his fist into his palm as though he were wearing a mitt , and held out his hands . " Here go , Eddie ! " he hollered . " Here go ! " Holding the ball in his hand , and without answering him , Eddie walked toward the curb , where the rest of the fellows were gathered around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands , and sniffling his nose , trotted after Eddie . " All right , choose Gelberg for sides , " Eddie said . Gelberg heaved himself off the curb and put on his punchball glove , which was one of his mother 's old kid gloves , with the fingers and thumb cut off short . " Odds , once takes it , " he said . After a couple of preparatory swings of their arms they matched fingers . Gelberg won . He chose Albie Newbauer . Eddie looked around him and took Wally Reinhard . Gelberg took Ray-Ray Stickerling . Eddie took Wally Reinhard 's brother , Howey . Marty hopped around on the edge of the group . " Hey , Gelberg , " he hollered , in a high voice . " Gim me a game , will you ? " " I got Arnie , " Gelberg said . Eddie looked around him again . " All right , I got Paulie Dahler . " They counted their men . " Choose you for up first , " Gelberg said . Feeling as though he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swung their arms , stuck out their fingers . This time Eddie won . Gelberg gathered his men around him and they trotted into the street to take MAGAZINE up positions on the field . They hollered " Here go ! " threw the ball from first to second , then out into the field , and back again to Gelberg in the pitcher 's box . Marty ran over to him . " Gim me a game , will you , Gelberg ? " " We 're all choosed up , " Gelberg said , heaving a high one to Arnie out in center field . Marty wiped his nose on his sleeve . " Come on , gim me a game . Did n't I let you lose my Spaulding Hi-Bouncer down the sewer once ? " " Want to give the kid a game ? " Gelberg called to Eddie , who was seated on the curb , figuring out his batting order with his men . " Aw , we got the sides all choosed up ! " Eddie said . Marty stuck out his lower lip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You give Howey Reinhard a game ! " he said , pointing at Howey sitting on the curb next to Eddie . " He ca n't play any better than me ! " " Yeah , " Howey yelled , swinging back his arm as though he were going to punch Marty in the jaw . " You could n't hit the side of the house ! " " Yeah , I can play better than you any day ! " Marty hollered . " You can play left outside ! " Howey said , looking around to see how the joke went over . " Yeah , I 'll get even on you ! " Marty hollered , hoping that maybe they would get worried and give him a game after all . With a fierce expression on his face , as if to indicate that he was through joking and now meant serious business , Howey sprang up from the curb and sent him staggering with a shove . Marty tried to duck , but Howey smacked him across the side of the head . Flinging his arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for no reason at all Paulie Dahler booted him in the pants as he went by . " I 'll get even on you ! " Marty yelled , when he was out of reach . With a sudden movement of his legs Howey pretended to rush at him . Almost falling over himself in panic Marty dashed toward the house , but stopped , feeling ashamed , when he saw that Howey had only wanted to make him run . 1 011 a while he stood there on the curb , wary and ready to dive into the house the instant any of the fellows made a move toward him . But presently he saw that the game was beginning , and that none of them was paying any more attention to him . He crept toward them again , and seating himself on the curb a little distance away , watched the game start . For a moment he thought of breaking it up , rushing up to the scoreboard and smudging it with his sneakers before anyone could stop him , and then dashing into the house before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came near him and flinging it down the sewer . But he decided not to the fellows would catch him in the end , smack him and make another scoreboard or get another ball , and then he would never get a game . Every minute feeling more and more like crying , he sat there on the curb , his elbow on his knee , his chin in his palm , and tried to think where he could get another fellow , so that they could give him a game and still have even sides . Then he lifted his chin from his palm and saw that the new kid was sitting out on the stoop in front of the house , chewing something and gazing toward the game ; and all at once the feeling that he was going to cry disappeared . He sprang up from the curb . " Hey , Gelberg ! " he hollered . " If I get the new kid for even sides can I get a game ? " Without waiting for an answer he dashed down the street toward the stoop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow ! " he shouted . " Want a game ? Want a game of punchball ? " He could see now that what the new kid was eating was a slice of rye bread covered with apple sauce . He could see , too , that the new kid was smaller than he was , and had a narrow face and a Large nose with a few little freckles across the bridge . He was wearing Boy Scout pants and a brown woolen pullover , and on the back of his head was a skullcap made from the crown of a man 's felt hat , the edge turned up and cut into sharp points that were ornamented with brass paper clips . All out of breath he stopped in front of the new kid . " What do you say ? " he hollered . " Want a gamer . The new kid looked at him and took another bite of rye bread . " I do n't know , " he said , with his mouth full of bread , turning to take another look at the fellows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to the store soon . " " You do n't have to go to the store right away , do you ? " Marty said , in a high voice . The new kid swallowed his bread and continued looking up toward the game . " I got to stay in front of the house in case my mother calls me . " " Maybe she wo n't call you for a while , " Marty said . He could see that the inning was ending , that they would be starting a new inning in a minute , and his legs twitched with impatience . " I do n't know , " the new kid said , still looking up at the game . " Anyway , I got my good shoes on . " " Aw , I bet you ca n't even play punchball ! " cried Marty . The new kid looked at him with his lower lip stuck out . " Yeah , I can so play ! Only I got to go to the store ! " Once more he looked undecidedly up toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over now . He turned pleadingly to the new kid . " You can hear her if she calls you , ca n't you ? Ca n't you play just till she calls you ? Come on , ca n't you ? " Putting the last of his rye bread into his mouth , the new kid got up from the stoop . " Well , when she calls me ? " he said , brushing off the seat of his pants with his hand , " when she calls me I got to quit and go to the store . " As fast as he could run Marty dashed up the street with the new kid trailing after him . " Hey , I got another man for even sides ! " he yelled . " Gim me a game now ? I got another man ! " The fellows looked at the new kid coming up the street behind Marty . " You new on the block ? " Howey Reinhard asked , eying the Boy Scout pants , as Marty and the new kid came up to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demanded , bouncing the ball at his feet and looking at the skullcap ornamented with brass paper clips . " Can you hit ? " . Come on ! ' . ' . Marty said . He wished that they would just give him a game and not start asking a lot of questions . " I got another man for even sides , did n't I ? " " Aw , we got the game started already ! " Ray-Ray Stickerfing hollered . Marty sniffled his nose , which was beginning to run again , and looked at him as fiercely as he was able . " It ai n't your game ! " he yelled . " It 's Gelberg 's game ! Ai n't it your game , Gelberg ? " Gelberg gave him a shove . " No one said you were n't going to get a game ! " With a last bounce of his ball he turned to Eddie , who was looking the new kid over carefully . " All right , Eddie . I 'll take the new kid and you can have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he were going to hit him . " Like fun ! Why do n't you take Marty , if you 're so wise ? " " I won the choose-up ! " Gelberg hollered . " Yeah , that was before ! I 'm not taking Marty ! " " I won the choose-up , did n't I ? " " Well , you got to choose up again for the new kid ! " Marty watched them as they stood up to each other , each eying the other suspiciously , and swung their arms to choose . Eddie won . " Cheating shows ! " he yelled , seizing the new kid by the arm , and pulling him into the group on his side . rpRviNo to look like the ball players he had seen the time his father had taken him to the Polo Grounds , Marty ran into the outfield and took the position near the curb that Gelberg had selected for him . He tried not to feel bad because Eddie had taken the new kid , that no one knew anything about , how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had had to go to the loser of the choose-up . As soon as he was out in the field he leaned forward , with his hands propped on his knees , and hollered : " All right , all right , these guys ca n't hit ! " Then he straightened up and pounded his fist into his palm as though he were wearing a fielder 's glove and shouted : " Serve it to them on a silver platter , Gel-berg ! These guys are just a bunch of fan artists ! " He propped his hands on his knees again , like a big-leaguer , but all the while he felt unhappy , not nearly the wayhe should have felt , now that they had finally given him a game . He hoped that they would hit to him , and he would make one-handed catches over his head , rim way out with his back to the ball and spear them blind , or run in with all his might and pick them right off the tops of his shoes . A little nervous chill ran through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit . On Gelberg 's second toss Paulie stepped in and sent the bail sailing into the air . A panic seized Marty as he saw it coming at him . He took a step nervously forward , then backward , then forward again , trying as hard as he could to judge the ball . It smacked into his cupped palms , bounced out and dribbled toward the curb . He scrambled after it , hearing them shouting at him , and feeling himself getting more scared every instant . He kicked the ball with his sneaker , got his hand on it , and straightening himself in a fever of fright , heaved it with all his strength at Ray-Ray on first . The moment the ball left his hand he knew he had done the wrong thing . Paulie was already on his way to second ; and besides , the throw was wild . Ray-Ray leaped into the air , his arms flung up , but it was way over his head , bouncing beyond him on the sidewalk and almost hitting a woman who was jouncing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposite . With his heart beating the same way it did whenever anyone chased him , Marty watched Paulie gallop across the plate . He sniffled his nose , which was beginning to run again , and felt like crying . " Holy Moses ! " he heard Gelberg yell . " What do you want , a basket ? Ca n't you hold on to them once in a while ? " " Aw , the sun was in my eyes ! " Marty said . " You wait until you want another game ! " Gelberg shouted . Breathing hard , Ray-Ray got back on first and tossed the ball to Gelberg . " Whose side are you on anyway ? " he hollered . Eddie Deakes put his hands to his mouth like a megaphone . " Attaboy , Marty ! " he yelled . " Having you out there is like having another man on our side ! " The other fellows on the curb laughed , and Howey Reinhard made them laugh harder by pretending to catch a fly ball with the sun in his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his hands cupped like a sissy , so that the wrists touched and the palms were widely separated . No longer shouting or punching his fist into his palm , Marty took his place out in the field again . He stood there , feeling like crying , and wished that he had n't dropped that ball , or thrown it over Ray-Ray 's head . Then , without knowing why , he looked up to sec whether the new kid was laughing at him like all the rest . But the new kid was sitting a little off by himself at one end of the row of fellows on the curb , and with a serious expression on his face gnawed at the skin at the side of his thumbnail . Marty began to wonder if the new kid was any good or not . He saw him sitting there , with the serious look on his face , his ears sticking out , not joking like the other fellows , and from nowhere the thought leaped into Marty 's head that maybe the new kid was no good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scout pants , and the mama 's boy shoes and all at once he began to hope that Eddie would send the new kid in to hit , so that he could know right away whether he was any good or not . But Wally Reinhard was up next . He fouled out on one of Gelberg 's twirls , and after him Howey popped up to Albie Newbauer and Eddie was out on first . The fellows ran in to watch Eddie chalk up Paulie 's run on the scoreboard alongside the sewer . They were still beefing and hollering at Marty for dropping that ball , but he pretended he did not hear them and sat down on the curb to watch the new kid out in the field . He was over near the curb , playing in closer than Paulie Dahler . Marty could see that he was not hollering " Here go ! " or " Ail the way ! " like the others , but merely stood there with that serious expression on his face and watched them throw the ball around . He held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of his shoe rested on the pavement , his belly was stuck out , and he chewed the skin at the side of his thumbnail . Gelberg got up to bat . Standing in the pitcher 's box , Eddie turned around and motioned his men to lay out . The new kid looked around him to see what the other fellows did , took a few steps backward , and then , with his belly stuck out again , went on chewing his thumb . Marty felt his heart begin to beat hard . He watched Gelberg stand up to the plate and contemptuously fling back the first few pitches . " Come on , gim me one like I like ! " Gel-berg hollered . " What 's the matter ! You afraid to reach for them ? " Eddie yelled . " Just pitch them to me , that 's all ! " Gelberg said . Eddie lobbed one in that bounced shoulder high . With a little sideways skip Gelberg lammed into it . H E ball sailed down toward the new kid . Feeling his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hurried step backward , and at the same moment fling his hands before his face and duck his head . The ball landed beyond him and bounded up on the sidewalk . For an instant the new kid hesitated , then he was galloping after it , clattering across the pavement in his polished shoes . Swinging his arms in mock haste , Gel-berg breezed across the plate . " Get a basket ! " he hollered over his shoulder . " Get a basket ! " Marty let his nose run without bothering to sniffle . He jumped up from the curb and curved his hands around his mouth like a megaphone . " He 's scared of the ball ! " he yelled at the top of his lungs . " He 's scared of the ball ! That 's what he is , scared of the ball ! " The new kid tossed the ball back to Eddie . " I was n't scared ! " he said , moistening his lips with his tongue . " I was n't scared ! I just could n't see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his face Eddie shook his head . " Holy Moses ! If you ca n't see the ball why do you try to play punchball ? " He bounced the ball hard at his feet and motioned Gelberg to send in his next batter . Arnie got up from the curb and wiping his hands on his pants walked toward the plate . Marty felt his heart pounding in his chest . He hopped up and down with ex-citement and seizing Gelberg by the arm pointed at the new kid . " You see him duck ? " he yelled . " He 's scared of the ball , that 's what he is ! " He hardly knew where to turn first . He rushed up to Ray-Ray , who was sitting on the curb making marks on the asphalt with the heel of his sneaker . " The new kid 's scared to stop a ball ! You see him duck ! " The new kid looked toward Marty and wet his lips with his tongue . " Yeah , " he yelled , " did n't you muff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was looking at Marty with a sore expression on his face , and his lower lip stuck out ; and a sinking feeling went through Marty , a sudden sick feeling that maybe he had started something he would be sorry for . Behind him on the curb he could hear the fellows sniggering in that way they did when they picked on him . In the pitcher 's box Eddie let out a loud cackling laugh . " Yeah , the new kid 's got your number ! " " The sun was in my eyes ! " Marty said . He could feel his face getting red , and in the field the fellows were laughing . A wave of self-pity flowed through him . " What are you picking on me for ! " he yelled , in a high voice . " The sun was so in my eyes . Anyway , I ai n't no yellow-belly ! I was n't scared of the ball ! " The instant he said it he was sorry . He sniffled his nose uneasily as he saw Gelberg look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house before anything happened . But instead he just stood there , sniffling his nose and feeling his heart beating , fast and heavy . " You hear what he called you ? " Patine Dahler yelled at the new kid . " You 're not going to let him get away with calling you a yellowbelly , are you ? " Eddie said , looking at the new kid . The new kid wet his lips with his tongue and looked at Marty . " I was n't scared ! " he said . He shifted the soles of his new-looking shoes on the pavement . " I was n't scared ! I just could n't see it coming , that 's all ! " Eddie was walking toward the new kid now , bouncing the ball slowly in front of him as he walked . In a sudden panic Marty looked back toward the house where old lady Kipnis lived . She always broke up MAGAZINE fights ; maybe she would break up this one ; maybe she would n't even let it get started . But she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nose , and with all his might hoped that the kid 's mother would call him to go to the store . " Any kid that lets himself be called a yellowbelly must be a yellowbelly ! " Albie Newbauer said , looking around him for approval . " Yeah , " Gelberg said . " I would n't let anyone call me a yellowbelly . " With a sudden shove Eddie sent the new kid scrambling forward toward Marty . He tried to check himself by stiffening his body and twisting to one side , but it was no use . Before he could recover his balance another shove made him stagger forward . Marty sniffled his nose and looked at the kid 's face close in front of him . It seemed as big as the faces he saw in the movies ; and he could see that the kid 's nose was beginning to run just like his own ; and he could see in the corner of his mouth a crumb of the rye bread he had eaten on the stoop . For a moment the kid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could see the little dark specks in the colored part around the pupil . Then the glance slipped away to one side ; and all at once Marty had a feeling that the new kid was afraid of him . ccVou gon na let him get away with call- ing you a yellowbelly ? " he heard Eddie say . From the way it sounded he knew that the fellows were on his side now . He stuck out his jaw and waited for the new kid to answer . " I got to go to the store ! " the new kid said . There was a scared look on his face and he took a step back from Marty . Paulie Dahler got behind him and shoved him against Marty . Although he tried not to , Marty could n't help flinging his arms up before his face . But the new kid only backed away and kept his arms at his sides . A fierce excitement went through Marty as he saw how scared the look on the kid 's face was . he thrust his chest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he hollered , making his voice sound tough . " Scared of the ball ! " The new kid backed nervously away , ? b ? and there was a look on his face as though he wanted to cry . " Yeah , he 's seared ! " Eddie yelled . " Slam him , Marty ! " Wally Reinhard hollered . " The kid 's scared of you ! " " Aw , sock the yellowbelly ! " Marty heard Gelberg say , and he smacked the kid as hard as he could on the shoulder . The kid screwed up his face to keep from crying , and tried to back through the fellows ringed around him . " Lemme alone ! " he yelled . Marty looked at him fiercely , with his jaw thrust forward , and felt his heart beating . He smacked the kid again , making him stagger against Arnie in back of him . " Yeah , yellowbelly ! " Marty hollered , feeling how the fellows were on his side , and how scared the new kid was . He began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Three , six , nine , a bottle of wine , I can fight you any old time ! " he yelled . With each word he smacked the kid on the shoulder or arm . At the last word he swung with all his strength . He meant to hit the kid on the shoulder , but at the last instant , even while his arm was swinging , something compelled him to change his aim ; his fist caught the kid on the mouth with a hard , wet , socking sound . The shock of his knuckles against the kid 's mouth , and that sound of it , made Marty want to hit him again and again . He put his head down and began swinging wildly , hitting the new kid without any aim on the head and shoulders and arms . The new kid buried his head in his arms and began to cry . " Lemme alone ! " he yelled . He tried to rush through the fellows crowded around him . With all his might Marty smacked him on the side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . Paulie Dahler shoved the skullcap , with its paper clip ornaments , over the kid 's eyes ; and as he went by Gelberg booted him in the pants . Crying and clutching his cap the new kid scampered over to the curb out of reach . " I 'll get even on you ! " he cried ; With a fierce expression on his face Marty made a sudden movement of his legs and pretended to rush at him . The kid threw his arms about his head and darted down the street toward the house . When he saw that Marty was not coming after him he sat down on the stoop ; and Marty could see him rubbing his knuckles against his mouth . Howey Reinhard was making fun of the new kid , scampering up and down the pavement with his arms wrapped around his head and hollering , " Lemme alone ! Lemme alone ! " The fellows laughed , and although he was breathing hard , and his hand hurt from hitting the kid , Marty had to laugh too . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he panted at Paulie Dahler . Pantie shook his head . " Boy , just wait until we get the yellowbelly in the school-yard ! " " And on Halloween , " Gelberg said . " Wait until we get him on Halloween with our flour stockings ! " He gave Marty a little shove and made as though he were whirling an imaginary flour stocking round his head . Standing there in the middle of the street , Marty suddenly thought of Halloween , of the winter and snowballs , of the schoolyard . He saw himself whirling a flour stocking around his head and rushing at the new kid , who scampered in terror before him hollering , " Lemme alone ! Lemme alone ! " As clearly as if it were in the movies , he saw himself flinging snowballs and the new kid backed into a corner of the schoolyard , with his hands over his face . Before he knew what he was doing , Marty turned fiercely toward the stoop where the new kid was still sitting , rubbing his mouth and crying . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he pretended he was going to rush at the kid . Almost falling over himself in fright the new kid scrambled inside the house . Marty stood in the middle of the street and sniffled his nose . He shook his fist at the empty doorway . " You see him run ? " he yelled , so loud that it made his throat hurt . " Boy , you see him run ? " He stood there shaking his fist , although the new kid was no longer there to see him . He could hardly wait for the winter , for Halloween , or the very next day in the schoolyard.
