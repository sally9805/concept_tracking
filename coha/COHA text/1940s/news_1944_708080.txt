txt Thomas E. Dewey laid the blame for labor troubles during wartime at the door of his White House opponent , in a major address delivered here tonight and broadcast by radio all over the country . Promising to preserve collective bargaining and give labor even greater freedom and rights than it has had under the New Deal , he at the same time made a bid for business support by pledging an orderly process and elimination of conflicting agencies and bureaus so that business , agriculture and labor could have real equality , and that " there will be no backdoor , entrance to special privilege by one group over any other group of Americans . " While Mr. Dewey did not mention Sidney Hillman 's Political Action Committee by name in his address , he made obvious allusions to the friction between the CIO and ' the AFL . The New Deal " makes political loyalty the test of a man ' getting his rights , " he declared . Audience Overflows Seats Mr. Dewey was introduced by Governor Langlie , who hailed Mr. Dewey as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to his responsibilities . " The audience numbered about 7,500 , of whom 6,000 filled the seats of the Civic Auditorium , and the rest stood around the back and sides . They cheered Mr. Dewey enthusiastically on his entrance and the band played the University of Michigan song " Hail to the Victor , " which apparently has been chosen as Mr. Dewey 's official campaign song . It is played by bands wherever he goes . The highlights of Mr. Dewey 's speech were as follows : The Administration labor policy has bred class division , hate and insecurity , and has made the wageearner 's salary and conditions of work a football of politics . The nation has no labor policy today ; it is adrift without chart or compass , and when the nation moves at all in the field , it does so at the caprice of one man , President Roosevelt . The first thing to be done on Jan. 20 is to appoint , from the ranks of labor , an active , able Sec- , retary of Labor . The functions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ department . " It will not be necessary for the workingmen and women of America to knock on door after door and sit in waiting room after waiting room to find out what their rights are . " Wagner Act Called Necessary The National Labor Relations ( Wagner ) Act is a good and necessary law , but it has worked badly because one-man Government can not keep its hands off the legally established processes , and it has been smothered by the piling on of administrative bureau after bureau , and has functioned with a Department of Labor that has a Secretary in name only . The Smith-Connally Act was passed because " honest men believed that nothing could make the situation worse , " but it has not solved the problem , merely increased the number of strikes . The law will expire at the end of the war and neither it " nor the other New Deal interferences with free // collective bargaining should ever be renewed . " The right to strike is a fundamental right of free men , and though it has sometimes been abused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New Deal has so delayed settlement , has made personal government and political loyalty the test of settlement , that labor had no alternative . The chief blame for wartime strikes " goes directly into the White House and to its agency created at the top of all this chaos of agencies , the War Labor Board . " The workers do not gain , the public does not gain , and the war effort has been hampered , while the strategy of delay in settling issues leaves the New Deal with the opportunity to " set the stage for a great gesture , a big favor to labor before election day , a gesture carefully designed to make labor believe that something it is justly entitled to is ' a special gift on high from the New Deal . " Those who believe that the course of collective bargaining can be turned back are doomed to bitter disappoinntment because " we are not going back to anything , riot to bread lines , not to leafraking , not to settling labor disputes with gun fire and gas bombs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build strong labor unions , and the freedom to do so . The working men themselves will drive both the racketeers and the communists from positions of power in the labor movement . That is why the racketeers and the communists are against a change of administration , and that is another reason for such a change .
