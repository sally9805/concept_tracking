To understand Argentina , the U.S. need only remember its own psychology before Pearl Harbor . <P> So advised Argentina 's Novelist-Critic Max Dickmann last week after four months spent in the U.S. at the invitation of the State Department . Novelist Dickmann , 41 , had earned the right to advise . Noted for his novels of Argentine life , he has long been a translator of American books , long a student of U.S. mores . <P> Biggest stumbling block in the path of good neighborliness , he said , is the long " misunderstanding " between the U.S. and Argentina . " All you know of us , " he says , " is what , you read in the newspapers . . . . All we know about you is what we learn from those big businessmen who live and grow wealthy in Argentina for 30 years without ever learning the language . Or we see your terrible movies-sex , loose women , jazz , gangsters , stupid slapstick comedy . How can you understand us , or we understand you , without effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present foreign policy . He wishes Argentina would take her place alongside the United Nations . But he insisted that Argentines are nearly 100% pro-Ally . If they do not choose to fight it is for three reasons : " A wrong conception of international politics , a pacific viewpoint engendered by 82 years of peace , a spreading of propaganda by Argentine isolationists that the U.S. is taking advantage of World War II to make a colony of South America . " Said he : <P> " Argentines are basically democratic . But they do not see this war as one of idealism-of Fascist totalitarianism v. the democratic way of life-but as a war of great interests . They see it in terms of Great Britain defending her empire against the challenge of a new German imperialism , of the U.S. seeking to throttle an expanding Japan . Argentines ask why should they go to war to protect England 's empire . Altogether , our attitude is very much like that of the U.S. before Pearl Harbor . "            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
