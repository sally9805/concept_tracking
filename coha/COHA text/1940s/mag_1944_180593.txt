In 1629 Frederick Henry , Prince of Orange , required four months to reduce the fortress of ' s Hertogenbosch . Last week Lieut . General Sir Miles C. Dempsey 's Second British Army did it in three days . <P> The town 's name , which means " the Duke 's wood . " perpetuates the memory of the Duke of Brabant , who gave it a municipal charter in 1185 . ( The odd-looking prefix is the Dutch sign of the possessive case . ) The land around ' s Hertogenbosch is low-lying and swampy . The Maas is three miles away to the north . <P> Last week the Germans blew up bridges over the Zuid Willemsvaart Canal . The British put down a Bailey bridge , sent infantry , tanks , flamethrowers into the town . <P> When they cut the roads to the north and south , the Germans pulled out to the west , leaving snipers and machine-gunners to be mopped up . Most of the people seemed too dazed by Allied fire to greet the liberators with more than a wave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German shellfire , a man carved himself a steak from a dead horse . <P> Rundstedt Retreat . Tilburg , ' s Hertogenbosch , Breda , Roosendaal and Bergen op Zoom were the bolt positions in the German line from the Maas to the Scheldt estuary . All five had fallen this week without much of a fight . Allied airmen reported columns of German transports scuttling north to the rivers . <P> The Germans evidently feared being pinned against the Maas as they had been nailed against the Seine in France . They had an estimated 60,000 troops below the Maas , including the doomed and dwindling pockets on the Scheldt estuary . They were definitely in retreat . In contrast to the bitter stalemate fighting elsewhere on the western front , the British-Canadian forces made good time . Nevertheless the Germans retreated in good order . They needed time to get set between the Maas. the Waal and the Led . They had to hold the Arnhem hinge . <P> Perhaps this retreat , a sound strategic move , reflected the return to command on the western front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ von Rundstedt , who was apparently back in Hitler 's favor . Field Marshal Walter von Model , the previous commander , was now in charge of the northern sector under Rundstedt . Field Marshal Johannes Blaskowitz commanded the southern . <P> Sudden Speed . Not even Rundstedt could do anything for the wretched remains of German garrisons in the Scheldt estuary . Their job was to hold out to the last , block the approaches to the vital port of Antwerp as long as they could . <P> The British fought mightily to shorten the time ; until Antwerp was opened , there could probably be no major assault on the western front . <P> British units in Lieut . General Henry Crerar 's First Canadian Army crossed the estuary in assault boats and amphibious vehicles , made a pre-dawn landing on South Beveland , joined up with Canadians who had fought their way out along the isthmus . This week the attackers overran Goes , the peninsula 's communications center . It only remained to press on to flooded Walcheren , blast the Nazis out of Flushing .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
