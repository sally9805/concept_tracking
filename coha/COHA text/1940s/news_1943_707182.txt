txt Tne United States Eighth Air Force has doubled since March , Major Gen. Ira C. Eaker disclosed this afternoon at a press conference at his headquarters somewhere in England . By October , he predicted , it will be twice as big , adding that the monthly increment of strength ranged between 15 and 30 per cent . United States planes , he asserted , have knocked down four enemy craft for every one of their own and in May the ratio rose to five to one , reflecting an improve ' ment in gunnery . The percentage of loss in daylight bombing , he said , has been less than 4 per cent in ten months of operation and as the force increases the losses curve goes down . General Eaker , who , with Air Chief Marshal Sir Arthur T ' 1Harris , is convinced that bombs in sufficient quantity will not only break I the enemy 's will to fight but deprive him of the means to carry on the struggle , said that before a year the Eighth Air Force and the Royal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theory to the test . General Baker sought , by frank discussion and by citing figures that must be treated confidentially , to dispel many a popular misconception regarding the war in the air . For instance , he was one of the first to concede that the replacement rate rather than bad weather is the limiting factor of the air offensive , and that such lulls as the present one , following on the battle of the Ruhr and the large-scale operations by the Eighth Air Force last month , were enforced by the necessity of pausing for breath or , as the ground force commanders would describe it , " regrouping . " The exact figure of the United States losses can not be given , but it is well under 5 per . cent of the total number of bombers sent against the enemy . Remarking that the Eighth Air Force in May took part in nine major air battles , General Eaker said he thought that was about the limit for any present-day air force using the same crews and planes . While American figures are lacking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on its night raids , lost 252 bombers from this island in May , according to Captain Harold L. Balfour , Under-Secretary for Air , in the House of Commons today , making a total for the first five months of this year of 874 . One of the most interesting disclosures came when General Baker said : " Our rate of operation is not , as some have supposed , dictated entirely by the weather . In fact , the weather is not nearly such a limiting factor as the supply of re7 placement combat crews and aircraft . 1 " We will never operate at a-rate which will bring about losses faster than we can replace them ( until some critical situation arises requiring an all-out effort , such as a landing on the Continent . " Armies can not fight major battles every day in the year , General Baker pointed out , remarking that it was unreasonable to expect the air force to do it either . If it could ; do battle only ten days out of the month it was only natural that its commanders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and most unfavorable to the enemy . Tactically , General Baker said , it had been demonstrated by experiment that 100 big United States bombers was the ideal number for a given mission . By that the commanding general of the United States Air Force in this theatre did not mean that only 100 planes would be sent against the enemy at any one time . On the contrary , he is looking forward to the day when he can send half a dozen or more such missions against the enemy , either in waves against such targets as the Ruhr or in six directions at once , to spread the German fighter defenses . Another popular illusion that General Baker attempted to destroy is the belief that targets for , attack are selected haphazardly . He knew right then , he said , what he was going to attack in June and July , in August and September . The whole pattern of German industry has been analyzed by British and American experts and a program laid down for destroying systematically , one after another , key industries so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declared .
