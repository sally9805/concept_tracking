In the bitterest days on Guadalcanal a year ago , Marines used to refer to the frequent runs of Jap destroyers carrying men and supplies down the Solomons as the " Bougainville Express . " Last week the Express was running again-but it was a U.S. Express and it ran the other way . Toward the end of the week the Japanese began coming out to meet the Express . The results were rough . <P> The invasion of Bougainville by the U.S. Navy and Marines under Admiral William F. Halsey and Lieut . General Alexander Archer Vandegrift was a big step forward ( see map ) . It represented an advance of 200 miles from the nearest big Allied establishment at Munda . It bypassed important Japanese positions at Buin on the southernmost tip of Bougainville , and in the Shortland Islands , 30 miles south of Buin . In those positions there were estimated to be at least 20,000 Japanese . But the real importances of the Bougainville blow were two : 1 ) it was a necessary preliminary to a necessity-the taking of Rabaul ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naval and aerial attrition . <P> Naval Drain . The Japanese reacted sharply to the invasion , but still did not commit anything like a battlefleet or a carrier task force . Even the limited reaction cost them dearly . <P> Just after the first landings on Bougainville , a task force apparently consisting of four cruisers and eight destroyers swept down toward the beachhead . About 40 miles from the landing point , the Japs met a roughly equal U.S. force . The Japanese kept the U.S. force at arm 's length by clever use of flares and torpedoes . But the fire control and aiming devices of the U.S. ships were superior . At extreme range , they were able to sink one cruiser and two destroyers for sure ( admitted by Japan ) and probably two more destroyers ( claimed by the U.S. ) . Announced U.S. loss : one ship " disabled . " <P> Then the Japanese began pouring reinforcements down from Truk , their South Pacific naval center . General Douglas Mac-Arthur 's announcements indicated that a total of 53 warships and eleven supply ships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ types by U.S. aviators occasionally leaves something to be desired ; and last week 's communiques on the reconnaissance reports may very well have duplicated each other . But it was clear that the commander of Japan 's Combined Fleet , Mineichi Koga , had been stung into action . He sent forward to Rabaul substantial cruiser forces in support of troop and supply ships , still did not commit battleships or carriers so far as U.S. reconnaissance could determine . <P> When the Japanese ships reached Rabaul , a U.S. Navy carrier force of 100 planes hit them . Torpedo planes and dive-bombers reported hits on five heavy cruisers and a light cruiser . Torpedoes alone hit two destroyers and a sixth heavy cruiser . Dive-bombers hit a second light cruiser . Later , Army planes bombed port , installations at Rabaul , claimed hits on a merchant ship .
