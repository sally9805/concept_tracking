One afternoon last week in Washington , tremulous , treble voices poured into a midget microphone and around the world . Forty-one children of foreign diplomats , attending a Christmas party in the Hall of Nations at the Washington Hotel , joined in the annual broadcast . A few of these diplo-moppets were panic-stricken , but most stepped up with little prompting and rattled off their Christmas pieces , twice-once in their native tongue , once in English . <P> Pretty Maria Garland of Peru was dressed in a costume of the ancient Incas . Usni Pramoj of Thailand was a small but elegant figure in silken plus fours . Starlet of the day was seven-year-old , barefoot , pinafored Liana De Bayle , daughter of the Nicaraguan Minister , and a veteran of international broadcasts . Liana recited a rhymed story of " a little Nicaraguan girl I think you know , " concluded : " I wonder if you now suspect this little Nicaraguan girl is me . " <P> Donn Casey , from Australia , cracked at his sister : " Jane 's scared but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not either " came over the air . Said Donn : " We send our love to you and to the boys and girls in Australia and to our Granny in Melbourne , Australia , who is listening for us . Hello , Granny-lots and lots of love from us and Jane and Donn shouted together a GREAT big kiss . " Twelve-year-old Elizabeth Pirie , of the British Embassy , said solemnly : " To my young fellow countrymen in Great Britain , I say we are all thinking of you and wish you the happiest Christmas that these times will bring . " Said Charles Cervenka , of Czecho-Slovakia , in a tense little voice : " What kind of a Christmas will the chil dren of Czecho-Slovakia have this year ? Our children at home can not rejoice but they do not despair . They are confident that Christmas Eve will come soon again , a glorious , happy Christmas in a liberated and free Czecho-Slovakia. "
