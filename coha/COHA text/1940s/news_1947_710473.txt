txt Locomotive builders are off on the most competitive race in their century-old industry . The goal is dieselization of American railroads Preference of railroads for the oilburning , diesel-electric locomotive over toe coal-fired " Iron Horse " has been gro  --  sing user the past decade . Of 636 outstanding orders for locomotives today , over 90ye are for diesels . Demand for diesels has helped put more than $300 million of orders on the books of the locomotive builders . But that 's only a drop in the bucket of what may lie ahead Of the 41,000 locomotives riding the rails today , about 37,000 are coal-burning . To replace these would he a multi-billion dollar operation Although that 's an extremely long range protect , the railroads appear headed that way ? at least as far as their cash will take them . G.M. in the Lead Far in the lead of the diesel rare is a relative newcomer to the locomotive field . That 's General Motors , the auto-making giart .

American Locomotive , which built Cie first diesel in this country back in 1924 , has at last got into this field in a big way It has teamed up with General Electric , svlit ? h furnishes the necessary generators and other electrical equipment . Baldwin Locomotive , second of this country 's two big steam locomotive builders . has tied in with Westinghouse Electric to participate in the diesel race . Fairbanks-Morse 8c Co. is the newest entrant in the locomotive field , although it has been in the diesel engine business for many years . it 's one of the biggest builders of diesels for ships . Lima Locomotive , third of the " big three " in the steam field , so far has decided to stay out of dies-Is . Revolution in L ? oman 's e Building The swing to diesels means a revolutien in the method of locomotive building Sin , the days of the " Torn Thumb . " first U. S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ e been tailor-made to specifications of the carious railroads . But the advent of the diesel has brought a standardized product which is built on an assembly-line . mass-production basis . Amor other things , this means parts will be interchangeable and producers will be able stockpile their locomotives for future demand The standardized product introduces a new competitive angle , too In the years ahead when demand does not outrun capacity to produce , the locomotive builders with the greatest mass production , cost-cutting knowhow will have a tremendous advantage Purchase price of a diesel is double that of a comparable steam locomotive . But the former quickly makes up the difference . Pre , dent Ralph Kelly of Baldwin figures that savings in operation compared with an old- ? s-pe steam locomotive , " will pay the Initial cost of a diesel in five to eight years . " Fuel is an important item of saving . The Lamp , publication of the Standard Oil Co , ( N. J. ) , declares that , according to an Interstate Commerce Commission study , " diesels reduced fuel costs 45e @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared with coal-burning steam power ? in the mist six months of 1946 This study , covering Class I railroads , fixed diesel fuel savings over con l at 56 : : for freight service and more than 73 , ; - for switching . A factor which railroad men call " availability " plays probably a bigger part than fuel savings in recommending diesels over steam locomotives . A locomotive is " available " when it is ready for instant duty . To keep steam locomotives " available " they must be continually fired , thus consum. mg coal . Otherwise the steam goes down . But diesels become " available " at the press of a button . Diesels work on much the same principle as your auto , only using oil instead of gasoline . The oil is forced into a cylinder after air has been compressed in it : the heat of the compressed air is sufficient to ignite the oil and expanding gas from the burning oil moves the piston in the cylinder thus creating mechanical power . This mechanical power is turned into electrical power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repairs , too . Bigger diesel engines are made up of units . Thus a 6.000 hp. diesel has three or four units . Should one unit become disabled , the other two or three could carry on and the disabled unit could be repaired en route Lower over all maintenanc e costs are credited to the diesel . It does n't require foundhouses , coal chutes and water tossers and their servicing personnel . Another argument advanced for the diesel Is the smoother operation of this type engine . That means fewer bumps and jars for railroad cars . Chairman Duncan W. Frazer of American Locomotive puts it this way : " There is reason to believe it may substantially reduce the annual cost of freight damage , a bill amounting to approximately $100 million a year according to the best authorities . ' While locomotive builders are giving their attention now to the diesel , they are keeping a watchful eye on another locomotive possibility , the gam turbine . This is the hope of the coal Industry for retaining the rich locomotive market whose loss to the petroleum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turbine consumes powdered coal ; it also may be fueled with oiL What are the possibilities of the gas turbine ? So far , it 's still in the experimental stage . But its preliminary teats have been impressive . Coal men say that it burns fuel so sparingly that it puts the diesel to shame on a basis of operating costa . Experiments sponsored by the Bituminous Coal Industry at Dunkirk , N. Y. , are said to have shown that a gas turbine locomotive can run a thousand miles without refueling . President Kelly of Baldwin , a diese booster , does n't overlook the gas turbine . He thinks that if it lives up to its backers ' hopes it could replace the diesel in railroad men 's favor within Ave years . American Locomotive , which is carrying out the Dunkirk experiment for the coal people . is impressed enough with the gas turbine to be spending considerable time experimenting with it . General Motors is keeping on top of the turbine situation in extensive experiments under way at its Allison Division laboratories . Whatever the gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of difference in railroads ' present plans for ordering diesels . C. Ft Osborne , General Motors vice president and Electro-Motive general manager . explains that the turbine , if it develops , could be " dropped " into the existing G.M ? locomotive in place of the diesel " About the only change necessary , " he says . " would be the addition of some gear ing to compensate for the high operating speeds of the gas turbine . " Complete dieselization is an early goal of several railroads . The New York , Susquehanna &; Western already has achieved this . The Monon ( Chicago , Indianapolis de Louisville ) plans to reach that state late this year . Gulf , Mobile &; Ohio and the Missouri-KansasTexas roads are close to being all-diesel . Boston &; Maine is moving 70% of its traffic by diesel . The Chicago , Burlington &; Quincy is handling all through freight from Chicago to Denver and from Chicago to Minneapolis by diesel . The Union Pacific has ordered enough diesels to dieselize its operations between Salt Lake City and Los @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Pacific Coast is expected to be dieselized in 1947 , " according to N. C. Dezendort director of sales and service of Electro-Motive . For the time being . railroad , are n't able to shift to diesels as fast as they 'd like . That 's determined by locomotive-makers ' capacity to produce them . Capacity of Electro-Motive 's giant plant at LaGrange , Ill is around 100 diesel-electrio units a month . Production is now up to 80 units a month and the company may produce this year close to 1,000 units ( one or more go to make up a locomotive ) . American Locomotive and Baldwin each expect to turn out at least 400 diesel-electric units this year . Fairbanks-Morse has not estimated itsa production of locomotives for this year .
