The antitrust division of the Justice Department has eyed the $200,000,000-a-year vitamin business coldly for months . Trustbuster Wendell Berge has focused his eyes on the scholarly , highly respectable Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation . Through a handful of patents , the foundation exercises a schoolmaster 's knuckle-whacking control over the industrial giants who turn out some $60,000,000 in synthetic vitamin D ( the " sunshine vitamin " ) and related products every year . <P> High Prices . In Chicago 's district court , antitrust intervened in a patent-infringement suit brought by the foundation . Last week antitrust charged that the foundation has conspired with 16 companies , including Standard Brands Inc. , E. I. du Pont de Nemours &; Co. , Pet Milk Co. , Parke , Davis &; Co. , to suppress competition in the manufacture &; sale of vitamin D. They also , said antitrust , limited the potency of vitamin D used in the widely advertised " enriched " bread , milk and other foods , thus preventing such foods from competing with the regular vitamin-D products . <P> Further , charged antitrust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that those most in need of vitamin D have been unable to afford it . Berge 's example : the cost of making vitamin D that sells for from $3.35 to $10.80 is 15 . Berge asked the court to invalidate the foundation 's vitamin patents , and open the richly profitable field to all comers , thus bring prices tumbling down . <P> High Ethics . Actually the foundation was started to avoid these very evils . After University of Wisconsin 's famed biochemist , Dr. Harry Steenbock , made his vitamin discovery , * he wanted to avoid " unscrupulous commercialization " of his find . He decided to let the university make the money , use it for research . <P> Nine alumni started the foundation in 1925 , which has no direct connection with the university . Each put in $100 . They picked as president a crack patent lawyer , Chicago 's grey-maned , hard-bitten George Haight . Since then , Haight has decided which companies will be licensed to use the Steenbock patents ( each pays royalties , averaging 10% and less ) ; how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could take . Example : Standard Brands could irradiate yeast , but nothing else . In all , the foundation has piled up a fund of $9,000,000. which eventually will go to the university . So far , the university has received $2,500,000 . Estimated income this year : $1,600,000 . Of this , Dr. Steenbock will collect his usual salary of $12,000 , Haight nothing . ( None of the foundation 's founders , or subsequent members , has ever been paid anything . ) <P> Only once has the foundation 's rule over vitamin D come close to being broken . Year ago , California 's southern district court held that the Steenbock patents were invalid because ultraviolet radiation was a nonpatentable " process of nature . " The foundation demanded a rehearing ; two months ago , the court withdrew its earlier opinion . ( Recently the foundation slashed its royalty charges. )
