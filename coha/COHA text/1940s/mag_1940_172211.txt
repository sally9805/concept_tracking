S. sportswriters hailed him as the Real McCoy to distinguish him from spurious Kid McCoys . . . night life in Paris ... a grey day in 1925 when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweethearts . . . the day he walked out seven years later with a parole in his pocket . . . . <P> Hazier &; hazier grew the recollections .

Beside him was a note : " ... Sorry I could not endure this world 's madness . . . . "
