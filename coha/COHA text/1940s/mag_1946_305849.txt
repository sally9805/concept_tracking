Obsession ( translated from the French of Louis Verneuil by Jane Hinton ; produced by Homer Curran in association with Russell Lewis &; Howard Young ) was called Jealousy when it was first produced on Broadway in 1928 . As a stunt play containing only two characters , it created a modest stir . It will-rouse little interest now . The play itself , stuffed with straw . by this time is also covered with dust . Perhaps it would still make a show piece for a pair of enormously skillful actors ; but Eugenie Leontovich , with her fussy tricks and alien corn , and Basil Rathbone , with his striding and reciting , leave the play as arid as they find it . <P> A French dime novel behind footlights , Obsession tells of a coldhearted minx who marries a very jealous man while remaining the mistress of a very rich one ! She is such a bad liar that the most trusting husband would be wild with suspicion in a week ; her own husband has spotted his rival before all the audience has straggled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As the curtain falls , the husband is taken into custody . The wife unconcernedly lights a cigaret.
