txt A widespread investigation by Federal , State and local authorities of the theft from the Port of New York of millions of gallons of fuel oils , some of which is suspected to have been used recently to refuel enemy submarines , was disclosed yesterday . The disclosure followed the arraignment yesterday morning in Magistrate 's Court at Stapleton , S. I. , of a Jersey City dock worker charged with the theft of 28,000 gallons of fuel oil . He was Joseph Nowicki , 26 years old , of 178 West Ninth Street , Bayonne , N. J. , an employe of Tankport Terminals , Inc. , which has storage tanks on the waterfront in the Greenville district of Jersey City . He was released in $5,000 bail for examination later on a charge of grand larceny . The news of that $1,200 larceny led to revelations by Spencer E. Bates , deputy State tax commissioner , that his department , the Federai Bureau of Investigation , the city police on Staten Island , New Jersey authorities and even the Coast Guard were cooperating in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gasoline and oil dealers , and " others . " These men were accused of siphoning off oil from tankers , storage tanks on docks , or tapping pipelines between tanker and shore in this port to the amount of " millions of gallons a year . " Loot Valued at $1,000,000 The practice has been going on for several years , Commissioner Bates believed , the total loot worth " conservatively " $1,000,000 . One company lost 250,000 gallons to thieves in one month not long ago , he said , adding that the State had been defrauded thus of many thousands of dollars in motor fuel taxes . The possibility that some of this " hot oil " has been delivered to enemy ships at sea has been receiving the attention of Federal agents for about three weeks . Oil company employes have been warned to watch for any suspicious sales of Diesel fuel or kerosene , which submarines burn , or unusual movements of cargo boats . Nowicki is the fourth man arrested in the inquiry so far , with " many more arrests to follow , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case said . Nowicki was taken into custody at police headquarters at St. George , S. I , , Friday night by Detective William E. Brown on Mr. Mitchell 's complaint . According to Mr. Mitchell , Nowield arranged for diverting some of the oil a Mexican tanker was unloading last Oct. 22 at docks of the Tankport Terminals . A small by-pass line was inserted into the long pipe between tanker and shore tank at night , the small line leading some of the oil to a tank barge manned by Nowicki 's confederate , Mr. Mitchell said . This man , Oswald Johansen , 34 , of 690 Annadale Road , Annadale , S. L , a ship 's engineer , was arrested last Thursday . He is free in 9500 bail for examination tomorrow in Stapleton . The other two men accused are Chris Hinson , 34 , of 353 Ridgewood Avenue , Eltingville , S. L , and Paul Freeman , 32 , of 3361 Richmond Terrace , Mariners Harbor , S. I. , captain and engineer , respectively , of the tank barge Mary Anna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bail of $1,000 each , awaiting trial May 20 on the specific charge of moving cargoes of oil about the harbor without keeping proper records . Mr. Mitchell said the Mary Anna had transported 175,000 gallons of " hot oil , " which was sold to New Jersey dealers at half the regular market price . Oil stolen in Staten Island was sold generally to New Jersey dealers and vice versa , Mr. Mitchell explained . It was difficult to detect the thefts , he said , since the men engaged were seamen , dock attendants and others who normally would be working about the docks . Also , a pipe line between tanker and shore tank sometimes is two miles long , he pointed out , and a tap temporarily inserted somewhere along the pipe at night would not likely be noticed . Sometimes , Mr. Mitchell said , the oil is pumped out of the tanker directly into the thieves ' tank barge . Then sea water is taken into the tanker to make up for some of the lost cargo weight , the oil floating on top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deputy Chief Inspector Michael F. , in charge of Staten Island police , for his cooperation . Typical of the warnings to oil company employes was one circularized throughout the sales department of the Texas Company on the Atlantic , Pacific and Mexican Gulf coasts by W. H. Kershaw , manager of the department , on March 27 . This notice read : " The District Number One Marketing Committee of the Petroleum Industry Committee appointed by the Petroleum Coordinator for National Defense has advised us that enemy submarines are suspected of obtaining fuel from off-shore fishing boats or other vessels . " Submarines may operate not only on light fuel , but also on kerosene .
