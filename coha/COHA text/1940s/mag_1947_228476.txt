The C.I.O. 's ninth annual convention in Boston last week , which a lot of delegates expected to be a Donnybrook Fair between the left and the right , turned out to be more like a day at Sunnybrook Farm . Shrewd Phil Murray had it firmly under control . <P> For weeks , Murray had pestered Secretary of State George Marshall to come to the convention . Russian propaganda cried that the Marshall Plan was a product of Wall Street . What better reply than for Marshall himself to address the C.I.O. convention ? George Marshall acquiesced . <P> He pleaded gravely for labor 's support of U.S. foreign policy , warned against " vicious propaganda and outrageous criticism " and reminded his 2,000 listeners that " among the first victims ... of the police state is the right of labor to organize itself for the protection of its own interests . " <P> His speech drew a long and enthusiastic ovation from the delegates . But it was not unanimous . Small groups of delegates of Communist-line unions kept their hands in their pockets . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off their seats ; even then , they did not join in the applause . <P> From then on , the leftists knew that they had no chance to sway the convention . They had come primed to fight for the re-election of bumbling R. J. Thomas as a C.I.O. vice president , and thus build up his efforts to take the presidency of the U.A.W. away from redheaded Walter Reuther . But the leftists never got their fists up . Phil Murray , taking note of rumors that Thomas was plotting with John L. Lewis to take the autoworkers out of the C.I.O. , called Thomas in and bluntly told them he was through as a C.I.O. top officer . When his nomination came up , Thomas bowed out . <P> The delegates had little chance to blow off steam until Phil Murray 's nomination for re-election to his eighth term as president . They voted him in by acclamation and gave him 20 minutes ' worth of howling , snake-dancing and table-thumping . Then Murray did some thumping of his own for price controls and smacked the Government for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was asked if he meant to include Harry Truman in his criticism . He did . Said Murray : " In this country we can criticize whom we choose , when we choose to . "
