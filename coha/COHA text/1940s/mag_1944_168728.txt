Caen-1062 <P> On one point close to Caen , British artillery poured 10,000 shells last week . But through the smoke that enveloped Caen British officers might still be able to pick out vestiges of the 1,000-year-old Romanesque towers and Gothic spires that once thrust up over the city . If so , they were probably the last men who would ever see them . For the architectural treasures of the city , which Henry Adams ( Mont-Saint-Michel and Chartres ) once called a " Romanesque Mecca , " seemed doomed . Among them were : <P> The nth Century church of St. Etienne ( see cut ) , where William the Conqueror was buried until the Huguenots scattered his bones . Known as the Abbaye-aux-Hommes ( Men 's Abbey ) , St. Etienne is one of Europe 's most important examples of Romanesque. * <P> La Trinit , called the Abbaye-aux-Dames ( Women 's Abbey ) . Founded in 1062 by William 's Queen Mathilda , La Trinit is surmounted by two square towers , instead of spires like St. Etienne 's . <P> William the Conqueror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Last fortnight the chateau was reported to be badly battered . <P> The exquisitely spired Gothic church of St. Pierre , built in 1308 . St. Pierre 's spire stood unscathed through the bombardment of Caen in 1563 , during the Wars of Religion . <P> It seemed unlikely that St. Pierre could survive the 20th Century , whose ruins , like its wars , tend to be total . <P> * Romanesque originated in Italy , is generally dated 500-1050 A.D. , is characterized by fortress-like solidity of construction , round arches , clustered columns with profuse ornament .
