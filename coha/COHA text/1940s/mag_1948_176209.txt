For more than six decades the little ( pop . 791 ) Iowa town of West Branch has listened to old Newt Butler tell the same story-how he licked Herbie Hoover in a scrap at the swimming hole . Last week , as ex-President Herbert Clark Hoover returned to West Branch to celebrate his 74th birthday , Newt reminded his old schoolmate of the bout . Hoover just grinned . <P> Some 10,000 other lowans flocked to the trim Quaker town to honor its only famous son . Hoover dutifully examined the two-room frame cottage where he was born , nodded as the old wooden cradle was pointed out to him , took a drink from a gourd at the wooden pump out back . Did it all look familiar ? Hoover smiled , explained candidly : " I left this home when I was four years old and moved to a house across the street . I do n't remember anything about this house . " <P> Social Security . Under the weeping willow trees outside , Hoover sat down with state functionaries to an Iowa lunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge birthday cake , while spectators gawked from beyond the low fence . He visited the old Quaker cemetery , where some dozen Hoovers are buried under the red cedars , and for a long moment stood with his head bowed before the grave of his father and mother . On a platform looking out over sun-splashed fields of the finest corn in lowans ' memory , Hoover spoke . He recalled leaving West Branch at the age of ten to live on his uncle 's farm ( his father died when he was six , his mother when he was nine ) , the long round of farm chores , the unending making of provisions for the next winter . " In those primitive days , " he said , " social security was had from the cellar , not from the federal government . " He recalled how he earned his first money : " I entered into collective bargaining by which it was settled that I should receive one cent per hundred for picking potato bugs in a field in sight of this stand . My impression then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wage rate . " <P> Hallowed Word . Then he turned serious . " I have had every honor to which any man could aspire . There is no place on the whole earth except here in America where all the sons of man could have this chance in life ... I have worked in governments of free men , of tyrannies , of Socialists and of Communists . I have met with princes , kings , despots , and desperadoes . I have seen the squalor of Asia , the frozen class barriers of Europe . And outstanding everywhere to these great masses of people there was a hallowed word-'America . ' To them , it was the hope of the world . . . Here alone are the open windows through which pours the sunlight of the human spirit . Here alone is human dignity not a dream , but an accomplishment.
