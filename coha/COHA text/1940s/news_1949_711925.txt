txt Express Men Plan Picketing To Curb Passenger Travel ' Lines Around Grand Central Terminal and Pennsylvania Station Are Threatened as Dispute on Union Contract Continues By STANLEY LEVEY Daniel Sullivan , general chairman of the Brotherhood of Railway and Steamship Clerks , AFL , threatened yesterday to have his union put picket lines around Grand Central Terminal and Pennsylvania Station . His declaration followed what he called a " lockout " by the Railway Express Agency of 3,000 employes in freight terminals , depots and sorting stations in New York and northern New Jersey . This came on the second full day of a slowdown demonstration by the union in protest against alleged " stalling " by the company on a new contract . Within a few hours after the slowdown began late Tuesday night the agency put an embargo on all air and rail freight of ' less than a carload into , out of and through New York . At the same time it notified 9,000 employes in ten ter ! urinals and fifty-six stations that their jobs would come to an end tomorrow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company apparently was not waiting until tomorrow to dismiss some workers . In midafternoon an agency executive announced that 1,177 men had been sent home for " failure to carry out their assigned duties . " He also said that it was " likely " that the company had given layoff notices to employes outside the metropolitan area . The union was more definite on the latter score . It declared that the concern was beginning to furlough workers " as far south as Baltimore and Washington " and the organization " concluded " that the same was true of company terminals in New England . Agency officials did not comment on this , although they admitted that further unemployment would result throughout the system in proportion to the amount of New York business handled by outlying points . Mr. Sullivan predicted that picketing of Grand Central Terminal // and Pennsylvania Station would " tie up " these two big railroad passenger centers . He said other members of his own brotherhood ? including ticket sellers , office workers , clerks , baggage men and some maintenance personnel ? would refuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do likewise . The action against the terminals was planned , Mr. Sullivan said , because " the railroads own the express . agency . " He added that permission to begin the picketing would be ' requested of George M. Harrison , grand president of the , brotherhood . The latter is in Chicago at mediation sessions affecting the demands of sixteen non-operating railroad brotherhohods . An emergency session of the New York district board of adjustment of the clerks ' union " to formulate our plans to combat the management lockout action " is expected to be called today , Mr. Sullivan reported . He said that decisions with regard to the picketing would be made . The ' board is composed of two delegates from each of the seven locals in the express division of the union and three members of the executive board . The locals are in Jersey City and Hoboken , N. J. ; Manhattan and Long Island City and Jamaica , Queens . " The lockout has so incensed the men that they may formulate some unusual demands on the management before this matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ union chairman charged that the " lockout " was an attempt by the company to circumvent the Railway Labor Act , which requires a seventy-two-hour notice before men may be removed from jobs . He called the action a violation of the law and said it " entitled " the union to set up picket lines . " The company would rather lock out its workers and let freight pile up than settle this dispute , " Mr. Sullivan said . There was no question that the accumulation of parcels and packages at the agency 's various installations still was mountainous . Virtually no inside activity was apparent at most of the big terminals and sorting stations and the familiar green company trucks were lined up outside the depots . The union said the slowdown was still on , with no sign of change . The company reported some activity at several unspecified terminals and said that " some men " were working and " doing a pretty good job . " A spokesman added that some deliveries had been made and some packages extracted from the job . He described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garment manufacturers , ' who provide the agency with an ' estimated 90 per cent of its busiIness in this city , were taking no chances on prolongation of the tieup . To avoid delay In Easter millinery shipments , New York concerns were contracting yesterday for alternative means of delivery . The Millinery Stabilization Commission and the Eastern Women 's Headwear Association engaged two trucking concerns . for direct shipments to customers or delivery to agency stations not curbed by the tie-up . Pick-ups began yesterday afternoon , according to Samuel Finkelstein , executive director of the commission . Manufacturers are to pay 50 cents and $1 a package , depending Ion size , for delivery to express terminals , it was reported . Regular rates will prevail for shipments to final destinations . ' The nature of the packages was held to prevent use of parcel post . Shipments were listed as only a day ' behind schedule . Coat , suit and dress manufacturers were said to be using parcel post in most cases , many from the ( main postoffice at Ninth Avenue and Thirty-first Street . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ express rates last summer most garment houses have been using parcel post , it was disclosed . The union and the company have been in negotiation since last April . The brotherhood seeks a five-day , forty-hour week instead of the present forty-four-hour , five-and-a-half-day schedule , with no change in pay . It also wants an hourly pay increase of 25 cents and changes in working conditions . The company has offered a staggered forty-hour work week at the same rates now paid for forty-four hours and an hourly increase of 7 cents , retroactive to Oct. 1 . The union has rejected this offer and the dispute is in mediation in Chicago . Present hourly rates range from $1.32 to $1.34 . Also affected by the slowdown and lay-off notices are 3,300 drivers in Locals 808 and 459 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters , AFL . Another 1,000 clerical workers might be laid off , particularly in accounting and claims departments , where their work is affected by the dispute . The Railroad Retirement Board . according to Mr. Sullivan . notified the company and the union yesterday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning next Monday . The air-freight business was declared to be booming as a result of the express tie-up . At La Guardia Airport one of the country 's largest domestic plane operators reported flying about 35,000 pounds of air freight to other cities .
