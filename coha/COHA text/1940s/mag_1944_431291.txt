YOU 'VE got the routine recon tonight . You 'll be flying a seaplane scout on reconnaissance in the combat sector patrolled by your squadron . Your primary responsibility is that of protecting our shipping and newly won shore base from a surprise night attack by enemy surface raiders ? despite the possible attempts of enemy night fighters to rid the air of your sharp eyes and blatting radio . For more than a week now , since shortly after American forces raced ashore to capture this port from the enemy , you and your squadron mates have flown nightly , searching up and down the coast and out to sea . The planes have been in the air in spite of bad weather , enemy opposition , and the hazards of night take-offs and landings without lights . Just at sunset , at the shack built by the enemy for an officers ' club ( they left excellent beer behind in their hasty departure ! ) , Air Operations and Intelligence officers carefully outlined the flight for you . Your special radio call was assigned ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radio jargon and plans of action were agreed upon . The anticipated movements of our warships and merchant ships cruis- ing just outside the harbor were explained . In the words of the Air Operations officer : " Bud , anything you see out in your search sector is the enemy , so do n't waste any time giving us the word ! " For an hour you 've been on edge to get going . It 's always that way before a hop . Now , as you walk to your plane in the fading twilight , you mentally check your personal equipment for the hop : heavy socks and shoes ( you might have to walk home some night ) ; dungaree trousers , heavy shirt , light flying jacket ( it wo n't be very cold " upstairs " ) ; .45 automatic . ( shell in chamber , ready for use ) in shoulder holster , extra clip of shells ( tracers , so that they can be utilized for emergency signaling ) ; six-inch sheath knife ( handy for cutting away shroud lines in the event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sealed tins of quinine , s%lt tablets ( to prevent heat exhaustion ) , aspirin , sulfanilamide ( for powdering on burns and wounds ) , sulfathiazole ( two tablets every four hours if burned or wounded ) . Helmet , goggles , rubber life jacket , and navigation chart board complete your gear . And here , lying alongside a makeshift dock in the water , is your plane . " Howdy , Stedman . About set ? " ( Stedman is your back-seat radio man-gunner . ) " Yes , sir . I 'm ready and so 's the radio . " Before the last of the twilight is gone there is time to make ' a quick check of the plane . First , the parachute flares suspended under the wings in the bomb racks . Give them a jiggle to see that they are hung securely . Both look " 4.0 " ( Navy slang for perfect ) . As you climb up the wing to your cockpit just behind the engine , you pause to inspect the compartment a little below your seat . Here is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll never have to inflate . Attached to this boat is a long string of provisions , each a tin of food sewed to a light rope . Hooked into this line are three canteens of water . Boat , food , and water can be jerked from the plane in an instant . Now , a leg up and over , a couple of squirms to settle yourself in the seat on top of the parachute ; your hands and feet work the stick back and forth , the rudder from side to side . The controls feel smooth . Reaching down carefully with your right hand , you touch the additional flares that are just to the side and under your bucket seat . These are ready to be popped out a little trapdoor in the side . Then to the fuel system . A tug on the gasoline-tank plunger sends the pressure up on the lines ; the fuelgauge needle flicks around to the " full " marker . You turn from the plunger to the maze of switches on the panel just above the rudder controls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cockpit lights , anchor lights . Time to plug your earphones into the radio connection . With the radio  | switch on " ICS " ( intercockpit communication system ) , you speak into the mike . " How does it sound , Stedman ? " " Sounds fine , sir . Ready back here . " Your left hand moves the mixture control to " Full Rich . " You pump the throttle back and forth rapidly several times , leaving it open slightly . A nod to the mechanic on the wing . He inserts the crank into the inertia starter , high on the left side of the nose . You reach forward , low and to the left , turning the gasoline tank selector from " Off " to " Main , " at the same time glancing at the ignition switch to be certain that it is " Off . " Your left hand falls back on the wobble pump just below the throttle quadrant ; your right releases the primer pump , and as the wobble builds up pressure in the gas lines you prime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives a loud " Clear " ( all clear of the prop ) . The starter begins its whine , becomes shrill . " Contact . " " Contact . " On with the ignition switch to " Both " magnetos . A hard pull to engage the starter . A loud cough . The engine catches . The throttle smooths its protesting , spitting rumble . The mechanic drops off the wing ; the beach crew lets the tail swing free . You 're on your own . Good luck and good hunting ! As you taxi out into the dark harbor , your eyes sweep the board , checking each instrument . Oil pressure O.K. Oil heat and cylinder-head temperatures climbing toward normal . R.p.m. steady . You pull your ' chute straps over your shoulders but do not fasten the leg or chest buckles . ( In case of a crack-up on the takeoff a strapped-on ' chute would slow a prompt exit from the cockpit . ) Snap the safety belt closed and rock forward against it to see that it 's tight and buckled . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except the dim outline of a darkened shore , but you 're out in the take-off area . Stedman anticipates your question with an " All set . " ( He is riding face forward for the take-off . As soon as the plane is well in the air , he will reverse his position in the rear cockpit , pull on his ' chute , snap his safety belt on in reverse position , break out his rear guns . ) You turn the plane onto the compass course for take-off . ( A silent prayer that no wreckage or small boats are in the course . ) Full gun ? throttle wide open . Back and forth , hard and fast , goes the stick , pumping the scout 's ponton up on its hydroplane step . The plane bucks and bobs . You rudder hard to hold compass course . Faster and faster . And up on the step she goes . Throttle wide open , you change hands on the stick . Your left goes to the stick to hold the plane on the step , your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seat , next to the flares . Three short strokes and the flaps are cracked down about 15 degrees . That will get the plane into the air at a slower take-off speed . Your eyes never leave the compass . " Up , baby , up . " Up she goes . Level off to pick up a little extra speed , then back easy for a gradual climb . Watch ' em close ? needle , ball , air speed ? make it a perfect take-off by instruments . Ease the throttle to cruising , the flaps to neutral . Get into your ' chute harness . The recon 's on its way . Five minutes  | after the take-off you have sufficient altirude to switch tanks from " Main " to " Auxiliary " with the tank-selector handle . It 's smart to burn the gas in the small tanks first , so that you will have your central supply untouched until last . Also , since you know exactly the capacity of the small tanks and since they burn up relatively early in the flight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour . As you switch tanks , you nose down slightly and hit the wobble pump a few times to pressure the gas from the new tank into the lines . The engine sings on beautifully . It always seems to hit better at night . Back and forth you sweep , looking for that telltale swirl of waters marking the track of a ship . Up the coast , out to sea in a great curve , back to shore . Half an hour passes . You flip the radio switch from " ICS " to " Transmit , " give it a few seconds to warm up the extra tubes , and then a call to the base radio station . You report : " Negative . Negative . " ( You have sighted nothing . ) The base answers with a repeat of your " Negative , " and you go back to " ICS . " Time starts to crawl . A second and third radio call to base , both negative reports . Once in a while you joke with Stedman . But a joke sounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cushion has turned to concrete . The recon has become an awful bore . No sooner do you make this decision than there is a loud backfire , a rough jerk on the ship , and the engine loses power . In a flash , your left hand has found the tank selector , you 've switched to " Reserve " and are pumping savagely on the wobble . The stick goes forward to pick up speed . The engine hits its pace again . Just a tank running dry ! Stedman speaks into the ICS : " I wish you would n't do that . It 's hard on my heart . Hard on yours , too ! " Three hours pass . You are twisting and turning around the edges of several small clouds faintly outlined against a slim sliver of moon when Stedman suddenly booms from the backseat : " A ship wake astern and to port . " Quick turn left ? and there it is . The enemy . Not one wake but four zigzag white feathers being grooved across the surface of the black waters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The transmitter snaps on . You speak sharply : " Emergency . Contact on four ships 20 miles out . " Base is back in an instant with the acknowledgment . Paralleling the enemy 's course , you drop down close to the water to get a look at his silhouette . Your eyes search the ships as you draw closer ? sweep over the fo'c'sles , up the bridges , down the stacks , on back toward the sterns . They 're the same class . Make sure now , it 's mighty important . Yes , they 're new-type enemy destroyers . Again into the mike : " Contact is four new-type dogs-dogs . " ( Four new destroyers . ) Mentally you picture the scene back at the base , the alert at Operations , defense units manning guns , the chirpy notes of CW messages to the commander of our protecting warships , the strident bong-bong of " general quarters " aboard those craft as they pick up speed and whirl to intercept the enemy . As these thoughts spin through your head , you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speed , formation . Once , when you duck in too close , the warship at the head of the column lets fly with antiaircraft guns . You dive away swiftly , turn back parallel to the enemy when out of his range . There 'll be action shortly , for the enemy warships and our forces are closing swiftly . At that moment the base radio gives you the word you 've been waiting for : " All units . Use Plan Afirm . Plan Afirm . " Plan Afirm is the battle plan . Your part is important and you 've got to move fast to execute it properly . A full-throttle climb away from the enemy , and you turn your radio on to warm it up . Then you call to base radio to say you 're in position . A moment later comes the answer : " Strike two matches . Two matches . " ( Drop two flares ! ) A hard jerk at the flare-release knobs . A moment later , the surface of the sea is brilliantly illuminated . Plainly visible , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces are lost in the darkness beyond the enemy ships . Suddenly there are redhot flashes of gunfire from that darkness . Our warships have the enemy spotted . Plainly you see the shells fall . A close straddle . More flashes . A broadside . The enemy has not fired , for he can find no target . The enemy changes formation and course . Our forces are firing steadily now .  | The base smacks through with another call , " Strike two more matches . Two more . " Out they go . Then the new flares add their light to the other flares , which by now have almost reached the water . Our warships are drawing closer now , their shells creeping up on the enemy vessels . Suddenly there is a blinding flash from the leading destroyer in the enemy formation . The ship just erupts . A direct hit on the magazine . Your plane takes a wicked bump from the concussion . That 's all the enemy wants ; the three remaining ships turn away from the action , put on speed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut short by a call from the base : " Enemy night fighters now operating in your area . " Well , if your luck will just hold a little longer you 'll get home . Your relief gives you a radio call at that moment telling you to go back to the base , that he 's taking over the patrol . ( He 's welcome to it ! Good luck to him ! ) Just one more hurdle ? a night landing on instruments ? and this recon mission will be finished . Back at the base you hit the landing circle at 1,000 feet , start a 600-foot letdown so that you will be at the down-wind end of the landing area when your altimeter shows 400 feet . You put it in the groove . " You 've got to fly the little scout into the water in a landing attitude from that 400-foot altitude . Back on the throttle now , get the excess air speed killed off , full flap . Slowly the plane settles . The turn indicator is at zero ( if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one ) , the bank bubble centered . Gently the nose comes up in a controlled stall . She 's just mushing along , throttle versus stick . With a crunch she hits . Quick , chop the throttle , back on the stick . A skid to the left . Opposite rudder . She 's on the water ? in one piece . ' A dimmed flashlight beckons from the beach . The engine noises die away as the switch is cut . The ponton grinds gently in the sand . A voice calls from the darkness , " What 's cookin ' out there , fella ? " " Nothing much . Enemy task force and night fighters came pokin ' around , but Sted and I scared ' em away .
