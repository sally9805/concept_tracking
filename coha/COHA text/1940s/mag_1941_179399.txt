They laid his body in state in the Air Ministry 's great hall and flanked it with an honor guard . Adolf Hitler renamed Luftwaffe Squadron 3 the Udet Squadron and ordered a state funeral . Reich Marshal Hermann Wilhelm Gring delivered the eulogy , then waddled after the flag-draped gun carriage on the mile-long march through silent , crowded streets to the cemetery . They buried him near the grave of Baron Manfred von Richthofen . <P> Thus Nazi Germany last week paid last honors to Ernst Udet , World War I ace , once best of the international aerobats , exponent of parachute troops and glider warfare . He had developed the dive-bombing tactics of the deadly Stuka after observation of U.S. Navy planes ten years ago . Adolf Hitler gave him sole credit for Luftwaffe efficiency , " which has made it the best air arm in the world . " <P> He was known as the Ace With Nine Lives , and he knew flying in all its phases - from production and planning to fighting and stunting . In a profession steeped in superstition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most faithful believer . When only 16 he launched a glider from a hill near Munich , crashed ingloriously in a cabbage patch . To gaping villagers , he cracked that the vicinity 's " magnetic attraction " made flying impossible . Like Hermann Gring , he flew with Richthofen 's Flying Circus , and his bag of 62 planes was second only to the Baron 's 80 . In a duel with the French ace Georges Guyne-mer , his machine gun jammed and left him helpless .

Udet parachuted to safety . In an Alpine circuit race he fouled his propeller in a 30,000-volt trolley wire . The plane lost its tail and Udet got a scratch on the arm . <P> Last week an official announcement said that Colonel General Ernst Udet , Quartermaster of the German Air Force , was killed " yesterday " ( Nov. 17 ) while testing " a new type of firearm . " The same day the Berlin radio attributed his death to an " airplane accident on Monday , the eleventh , " said he died en route to a hospital . Reports from Vichy said he was a suicide . Many a U.S. airman and war veteran could recall Ernst Udet as a stumpy , laughing , likeable little man with a thirst for beer and information , a man of many questions who carefully avoided questioners . The last photograph of him alive , as approved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tight-lipped man looking considerably older than his 45 years .
