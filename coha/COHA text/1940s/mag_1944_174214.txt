In Princeton University Chapel on Thanksgiving Day , Dr. Henry Sloane Coffin , president of Union Theological Seminary and foremost U.S. Presbyterian , preached proud Americans a sermon on Christian humbleness . Excerpts : <P> " We are celebrating a national thanksgiving . If we and our fellow citizens thoughtfully and sincerely say : ' Not unto us , O Lord , not unto us , but unto Thy name give glory , ' there is a good chance that the American people will grow more likable in the eyes of mankind . . . . <P> " As a nation , doubtless we have always been self-reliant , not to say cocky . . . . <P> Now that we are aware of our enormous might , we may become much more cocky , and therefore intolerably offensive in the eyes of nations whose excellencies are along other lines . Conquering nations have seldom been humble . That is one reason why victorious wars have not brought enduring peace . . . . <P> " We shall become impatient and irritated with our allies ; and God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... Penitent , pardoned , and therefore truly humble Americans-can we fancy it ? - may under God be used to discover and help establish wise international arrangements . "
