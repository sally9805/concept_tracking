Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse , that there may be meat in mine house , and prove me now herewith , saith the Lord of hosts , if I will not open you the windows of heaven , and pour you out a blessing that there shall not be room enough to receive it. - Malachi 3:10 . <P> This ancient text on tithing still looks sensible to Quaker Perry Hayden , an energetic mill executive of Tecumseh , Mich . Five years ago Hayden launched a dramatic experiment to prove that tithing works . He planted 360 kernels of wheat in i a plot 4 by 8 ft . Each year he has given a tithe ( one-tenth ) of the crop to the church , resown the rest . This week he and several hundred fellow tithers will go into a 230-acre field to harvest approximately 5,060 bushels . <P> The first year 's tithe amounted to only five cubic inches of grain , which was contributed to the Tecumseh Friends Church I and eaten by the pastor as breakfast cereal . The remainder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of land given by Henry Ford , to whose thrifty imagination the lot-from-a-little scheme had strong appeal. * As the project burgeoned , Ford continued to donate the geometrically progressing areas of land , and at last September 's sowing personally broadcast a peck of the symbolic wheat . <P> This year , Hayden will divide the 4,500 bushels of wheat which are to be replanted between 4-H groups and farmers who have pledged themselves to sow it . They will give 10% of next year 's harvest to the church of their choice and 5% to the ' ' Dynamic Kernels Foundation " ( incorporated to make charitable gifts , distribute literature " bearing especially upon Christian Stewardship and the blessings coming to those who tithe " ) . This year 's tithe will go to local hospitals . <P> Obviously such a program must stop somewhere . At the present rate of increase , the twelfth year of sowing would require more than the earth 's surface . But for the Tecumseh Quakers , mindful of Leviticus 25:3 , 4 , next year 's sowing will be the sixth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schoolmarm , once asked Ford for a $1,000,000 donation to her country school , was listened to politely but received only a Ford dime . Undaunted , she used the dime to start a peanut crop , solemnly sent Ford detailed annual accountings of each year 's harvest , eventually bought a piano with the profits of the 100 worth of seeds . Ford was impressed , eventually visited the Berry School , square-danced to the piano , finally came across with more than the $1,000,000 Miss Berry originally asked for .
