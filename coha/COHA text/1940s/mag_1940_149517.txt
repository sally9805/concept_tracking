To judge by their recent complaints , the people of England hate the air-raid alarms more than they hate air raids . Last week the Ministry for Home Security bowed to the popular will , reduced as much as it could the time of sounding each alarm- from two minutes to one . <P> No haphazard noisemakers are Britain 's wailing sirens . Sounded by air pressure operating on electric oscillators , they produce a discord which in the Middle Ages was regarded as the work of the devil . This discord is the augmented fourth ( example : C and F sharp on the piano ) , was called the tritone because it spans three whole tones . The tritone was banned in sacred music , thus giving rise to a maxim : Mi contra fa est diabolus in musica ( The tritone is the devil in music ) . When the sirens , beginning on a sweet major third or fifth , slip up and down into the bloodcurdling tritone , it sounds that way to Londoners .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
