While Iran and the world waited , the deadline came &; went . The Russians were still there . <P> The Anglo-Soviet-Iranian Treaty of Jan. 29 , 1942 ( to whose aims the U.S. later gave its blessing ) pledged Britain and Russia to quit the country by March 2 , 1946 . When Britain and the U.S. last year sought to predate the deadline , Russian Foreign Commissar Viacheslav Molotov acidly observed : " The Soviet Government is. guided strictly by the time limit established in the " 1942 treaty . " <P> Two of the Big Three met the deadline . The last G.I. quit by Jan. 1 , the last Tommy before midnight on March 1 . But Russia had let down deeper roots-in the Communist-controlled " autonomous " province of Azerbaijan . If the Red Army withdrew from the north , Azerbaijan would forthwith lose its autonomous props . Nor had the Kremlin had enough time to negotiate a new treaty with Iranian Premier Ahmad Gavam Saltaneh , who had been in Moscow since Feb. 19 . <P> Part In , Part Out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Premier Gavam had been " notified " of the Soviet decision to begin withdrawing its troops on March 2 from districts " where the situation is relatively more quiet " in eastern Iran . In other areas the Red Army would stay " until the situation has been elucidated . " <P> In Moscow , the " elucidation " proceeded . Susceptible Premier Gavam might be willing , but his parliamentary majority ( 52-to-51 ) was too weak for far-reaching concessions . Any plan to abrogate Iranian sovereignty over Azerbaijan would almost certainly be repudiated by a hostile House . In vain Prince Firouz , Director of Propaganda , soothingly explained the Soviet presence in troubled areas as a " friendly gesture . " Angry deputies called it " an act of aggression , " " a threat of another world war . " <P> If Moscow listened to any protest at call , it would not be to the feeble whisper of its southern neighbor . To Moscow went a note from London requesting an explanation . How much farther Britain would or could go depended on how much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( see NATIONAL AFFAIRS ) .
