txt New strides in the conquest of space by rockets make it necessary for the United States to have a 3,000-mile proving ground for launching such weapons , Congress was told today . Cost of providing such a test area would be $200,000,000 . Military and scientific authorities said that this country would have rockets this year capable of traversing 500 miles , and that eventually their horizontal range might be extended to 5,000 miles . The officials testified before a House Armed Services subcommittee on the necessity of creating the broadened test range . The testimony prompted speculation that American scientists had finally surpassed Germany 's wartime V-2 effort . Asked for comment , an Air Force spokesman told a reporter : " That 's classified ( secret ) information to say definitely that vie have passed the German horizontal range . But , " he added , " it 's not a bad deduction . " So faraS is known , the altitude record for rocket missiles is still held by a captured German V-2 that reached 114 miles at White Sands , N. M. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course would undoubtedly have its launching site within the continental United States , but they were hesitant about disclosing details . These officials said that several surveys had been made , covering the western United States desert for prospective use as both launching ant impact areas . One official said the Banana River area of Florida has been considered as a launching site . In a letter supporting the project , Secretary of Air W. Stuart Symington told the House subcommittee that the progress of " certain other countries " toward developing rockets with inter-continental ranges emphasized the immediate necessity of the United States program . Mr. Symington said the project should be undertaken at the " earliest possible date . " ? Gen. Muir S. Fairchild , Air Force vice chief of staff , told the House group : " Missiles with ranges up to 500 miles will be ready for testing during 1949 , without a range of sufficient length on which to fly them . " Our program has proceeded to a point where a flight test range of far greater length than any now in existence is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who directs the nation 's top peacetime military - research program as chairman of the Research and Development . Board , was asked by Representative W. Sterling Cole , Republican , of New York , how great a range was now ' considered feasible by scientists . Dr. Compton replied : - " Certainly 5,000 miles is within the range of possibility . Whether such a range would be desirable depends , of , course , on the accuracy of your controls . Our program is primarily designed to work out the controlling of guided missiles . " The scientist said it is now possible to haul a ten-ton bomb load 3,000 miles , and the same feat could be performed by a guided missile if it were as large as modern aircraft . Brig . Gen. William L. Richardson of the Air Forces said about $60 , - 000,000 of the proposed $200,000 , - 000 authorization would be spent in the first three years , with the balance spread out over a total ten-year period . General Richardson said the 3,000-mile range would include a launching area , stations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an impact area where the missiles would land .
