King , Commander in Chief of the United States Fleet , called last night for unabated war bond purchases to continue the manufacture of tools of victory , now falling behind " mounting requirements . " Unless some production deficiencies are wiped out , he asserted , the tempo of , our Pacific operations will be slowed down . Admiral King issued the appeal in a prepared address broadcast over the Blue Network at the opening of the Sixth War Loan exhibit at the Navy Pier in Chicago as preparations were being completed for the country to embark tomorrow upon what promises to be the most vigorous of all its war bond campaigns .

Bing Tells of Growing Demands Pointing out that accelerated operations have created new production problems for the Navy , Admiral King declared that the fact the war today is " well ahead " of last year 's expectations should stimulate rather than sap our determination to carry on with every means we can muster . Among the items he listed that must be furnished to the fleet in increasing quantities were assault transports , supply vessels , rackets and highcapacity ammunition . " Assault transports and supply vessels which traverse the wide expanse of the Pacific carrying battle troops and their battle equipment to enemy beachheads are not being produced rapidly enough to enable us to maintain our momentum , " the admiral said .

" Other deficiencies named were in wire cable , maintenance parts for ships , and in the building of special types of planes . Victory Still to Be Won " While no previous bond drive in this war has been conducted in such an atmosphere of victory in battle , it must not be forgotten that victory in war , both in Europe and even more so in the Pacific , has yet to be won , " Admiral King warned . " It must not be forgotten that action in the Philippines has been costly in ammunition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will never fly again . And it must not be forgotten that as we get closer and closer to Japan our task becomes more difficult . " Those items are the tools of victory that your war bond purchases have made possible . They must be supplied to the fleet in increasing quantities . In order to do that , your bond purchases must continue without abatement . " The Navy and the Army have not let you down in the conduct of the war . I am sure you will see to it that you do not let us down in providing the means wherewith to end the war . " Morgenthau Hails Gains Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau Jr. , seconded the Admiral 's request for funds " to save the expenditure of lives by the expenditure of ammunition and materiel .

" No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and humiliating a retreat , " he added , but it requires huge expenditures of money to execute Navy policy .

There may be a hundred Aachens , a hundred Leytes between us and final victory . That is why there must be a Sixth War Loan Drive and a seventh and perhaps an eighth before this war is won .
