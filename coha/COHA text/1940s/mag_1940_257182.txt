Through the streets of Boston last fortnight clip-clopped a horse ridden by a Negro wearing a ballet costume and a red wig . The plug , advertising the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo ( see p. 38 ) , was the bright idea of one of the brightest of young U. S. Museum directors : lanky , fair-haired James Sachs Plaut , of Boston 's Institute of Modern Art . Smart Jim Plaut , 28 , had arranged for the Institute to sponsor the opening of the Ballet , and to pocket any thing the box office took over $3,000 . The Institute pocketed $1,000 . <P> When the performance was over , most of the audience and some of the ballerinas trooped to Back Bay to view a top-notch art exhibit-78 paintings by Georges Rouault-and the Institute 's new home at No. 210 Beacon St. The guests , queued up in the street and taxing the energies of the ushers ( Harvard footballers ) , packed three floors of the building , sipped hot bouillon and champagne punch , saw more of each other than of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ founding by Manhattan 's Museum of Modern Art , was weaned two winters ago , a year after Jim Plaut became its director . A Harvardman ( 1933 ) , he took art as a snap course . Since then Jim Plaut has had two great ambitions : to get permanent quarters for the Institute ; to put on the first big Rouault show in the U. S. The quarters he got from Mrs. Joel Goldthwait , mother of Nathaniel Saltonstall ( first cousin of Governor-re-elect Leverett Saltonstall ) , who is the Institute 's president and Boston 's most eligible bachelor . She handed over her five-story house with no strings . Director Plaut would have liked to raise $25,000 to remodel it , but the war held him down . He settled for $4,000 , contributed by Institute members , painted the red brick front grey , the front door bright blue , the interior pale blue . He lighted it by fluorescent indirect lamps . <P> Mild-looking , baldish Georges Rouault , who was born in a bomb shelter during the Paris Commune , is now 69 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Paris , where he holds a sinecure as director of a museum full of fairy-tale paintings by his teacher , Academician Gustave Moreau . Today a good Rouault costs about $3,500 . For the Institute 's Rouault show , Director Plaut was unable to import any paintings from Europe , or even to borrow one from the late exhibition at the New York World 's Fair . He collected his show from U. S. museums and private owners , including Showman Billy Rose , and Actor Edward G. Robin son , who sent lengthy telegraphic suggestions about the lighting . <P> The Institute 's Rouaults , ranging back to 1891 , showed the pious painter 's long preoccupation with circus clowns , tortured Christs , brutal judges , violent nudes , all painted in slashes of black , and brilliant , jewel-like reds , blues , greens which recalled Rouault 's early apprenticeship to a stained-glass worker . Boston 's plushiest Brahmins viewed the paintings with no murmur of disapprobation , even for a wrenched , very nude Red-Haired Woman , which was one of the high points of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus had James Sachs Plaut put critics to rout .
