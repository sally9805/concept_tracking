German Prisoners Talk Your Ears Off By ERNE ST 0 . HAUSER During my tour , which brought me face to face with freshly captured Germans from peasants to Ph.D . ' s , from wood carvers to surgeons , I was subject only to the rules of the Convention of July 29 , 1929 , Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War  --  Geneva Convention  --  signed by the President of the United States in 1932 . This convention stipulates that , once an enemy soldier has been placed in a prisoner-of-war camp , he is entitled to privacy and must be protected , in particular , against " acts of public curiosity " ? Article 2 . Consequently , I was not at liberty to interview prisoners on my own . However , prisoners of war lead a humdrum existence and are bored with their inactive life . Whenever word got around that a correspondent who spoke German fairly fluently was in reach , I received more invitations than I could possibly have accepted . Hundreds of Germans came to me with their gripes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from having to interrogate them , I found that most of them had a tendency to talk my ears off . Of the 750,000 prisoners taken by the Allies in Western Europe since D day , roughly one half are now in France and will remain here , together with future arrivals , until the war is over . The original plan of shipping prisoners back to the United States as fast as they came walking into our parlor had to be modified when prisoners were taken by the thousands instead of by scores , and when we had more prisoners on PARIS , BY WIRELESS . HE Germans are nice people . They are kind people . They are perfectly charming people ? when they are licked . " These words , spoken to me by an Englishman twice wounded in two wars , could Nerve as a motto for the report i have here to make . in the last few weeks , I have spent a considerable amount of time with that rather large portion of the German army which is now garrisoned behind American barbed-wire fences in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from front-line cages to the busy dock areas of French ports , and I have been able to form some ideas as to their state of mind . As these prisoners represent a fair cross section of the German people as a whole , my impressions , however incomplete , might well serve as a preview of the larger problems awaiting us inside the Reich . D plus 100 than we had figured on taking in the first year of the Continental campaign . In accordance with a decision made by the Joint Chiefs of Staff earlier in the war , the total of prisoners taken is split fifty-fifty between the American and British forces , regardless of who originally captured them . Actually , at this writing , more nearly two thirds of all the prisoners on the Continent are still being cared for in American camps . Although taking prisoners is considered an honor , keeping them is a distinct liability . The Geneva Convention demands that we feed , clothe and shelter them according to the standards set for our own troops . This obligation adds a considerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systems . The expense , however , is partly compensated by the work these captured Germans are doing , here in France , as auxiliary laborers in the employ of Uncle Sam . Their work is voluntary and paid for according to internationally set standards ; the pay is not high , but most prisoners prefer a good workout under the cranes of a French port to a long and boring day in camp , Thus , wherever you our communication zone behind the lines , you 'll find those gray-uniformed workmen  --  and , in all fairness , it must be stated that their work is good . I have watched them clean up debris in n French city by the hour , and I found no one dawdling or malingering . Roth the French labor shortage and the generally inferior quality of available French labor underline the wisdom of allowing those captive " supermen " to work for a living . No praise is too high for the job our hosts to this army of prisoners have been doing since D day . The care of prisoners is entrusted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the European Theater of Operations . Chief of the division is Col. Robert J. Gill , a gray-haired , wise and good-natured former corporation lawyer from Baltimore , who is responsible for the fact that the tidal wave ofincoming prisoners did not break the floodgates . The job of organization he has done with wholly inadequate means is a remarkable achievement of Yank ingenuity and improvisation , and a record of which America will be proud when the history of this war is written . Colonel Gill now controls an army equal in strength to more than ten divisions  --  all of them enemy soldiers . He is assisted in this gigantic task by a mere handful of highly trained men and , because of previously made allotments of manpower , finds it almost impossible to augment his staff . " Back in the good old days before D day , " Colonel Gill told me , " we had one camp  --  just one ! ? in England . It was a show place if there ever was one , really a work of art . Today , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use everything from abandoned French factories to former German camps for Allied prisoners , and turn them into habitable quarters . " The colonel , whose full name , it has been suggested , should henceforth read Bob I " Geneva Convention " ) Gill , admits that he is assisted in his task by the national characteristics of his charges . " I believe in giving the devil his due , " he says . " The discipline with which they obey our commands and the commands of their own noncoms obviously facilitates our job . You can tell ' cm to do anything , and they 'll snap right to it . " Asked whether he thought we were pampering the prisoners , the colonel 's eyes twinkled . " Prisoners of war are human beings by the grace of the Geneva Convention ; we treat them as human beings . Pampering ? We could n't do it if we wanted to , with the means at our command . They arc not used to pampering at home , either  --  and , after all , they started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had n't been put behind barbed wire , they would go on killing our boys on the front . " The first thing I saw in one of the enclosures that I visited in the field was a rather dramatic incident with an anticlimactic ending . Two German prisoners were brought in who had attempted to escape and hadbeen caught . The American captitin who was charged with receiving the two was hopping mad  --  escapes always cause extra work and mess up the records . But he managed to swallow his anger and addressed the two , through his interpreter , with an almost stilted courtesy . " According to Article Fifty of the Geneva Convention . " he said , " you are liable only to disciplinary punishment . Two daps solitary is all I can give you . Dismissed . " The two culprits clicked their heels smartly and marched off , grinning broadly . Attempts to escape from our prisoner-of-war installations in France have not been frequent . Not that it is n't possible to sneak away from work details ; no amount of vigilance can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assistance from 40,000,000 Frenchmen , who can smell a German three miles against the wind , and word has got around among the prisoners that the air inside the American enclosures is a good deal healthier than it is in the rest of liberated France . Almost all of those who tried escapes have been brought back . Three of them , the other day , were caught in a corner of an American airport , and proudly admitted that they had planned to steal a transport plane and fly it back across the Rhine , " Must have seen some movies , " was the laconic comment of the G.I. corporal who brought them back . Psychologically , each prisoner of war goes through an interesting cycle . It begins with an all-time low at the time of his capture . A man who has just been hauled in by the enemy is like a dazed , confused animal . His mental processes are disrupted . Everything has come to an end and he does not know what he is heading for . All he wants is a place to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him to become his original self . As a rule , therefore , a German prisoner who has been behind barbed wire for a month will strike you as a more intelligent , more articulate and , very often , more arrogant fellow than one who has just been dumped into I hastily constructed cage immediately behind the lines . German prisoners know their rights  --  in fact , they know them . surprisingly well . " Lanka like they all memorized the Geneva Convention before they learned how to shoot , " one camp sergeant remarked . One of their rights , on which they frequently insist , is that , upon demand , they must be shown a copy of the Geneva Convention printed in their own language . They do not have to answer questions , beyond giving name and rank . Obviously , prisoners are a gold mine of information , and there are many things they could reveal if they felt like talking ; many do , and some actually bubble over with facts and figures they are anxious to pass on . The news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from loquacious prisoners . But their captors can not make them talk . A current G.I. joke tells the story of the interrogating officer who , when his questions remained unanswered , had his men paint a large R on a prisoner 's back . " What 's that for ? " the other prisoners asked . " Oh , nothing , nothing , " was the reply . " It simply means he 's in the bunch that 's going to Russia . " Thereupon , the story continues , the prisoners were very glad to talk . Your correspondent is in a position to state that the story , though funny , has no factual basis whatsoever . Camp life seems to suit those Germans rather well . Collectivists that they are , they get a noticeable lift out of the enclosure routine . Their discipline , under their own properly elected camp lenders , is of the highest . An American officer walking down the main artery of a camp has to return so many salutes that he 'll have a sore arm for the rest of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily have looked the other way . Their singing , when they march out or return from work , is snappy and their gait as springy as that of free men . But the marching and singing are not much more than a deceptive facade . When you talk with the prisoners , you 'll find a different and far less cheerful picture . The great majority are tired and want to go home . They are in a blue themorning-after mood , rubbing their temples after the greatest binge in history . Birds of prey with clipped wings  --  the fight has gone out of them . A defeated German is a very defeated man . The average Landsat  --  the German equivalent of G.I. ? is a well-read , educated , intelligent fellow ; he knows that Germany has lost the war and he will , in many cases , // ? ( Continued from Page 61 ) been a stonemason in a small town in Southern Germany , and how wonderful it had been to come home from work in the evening and to embrace his wife and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never be happy again , " he said , and large tears stood in his eyes , I excused myself . I had noticed , while I was the guest of the S. S. gang , a stocky young man with closely cropped hair who had constantly heckled the ex-mason . " I 've never been a Nazi , " he had said , " so I do n't have to change my opinions now , like so many of you . " " Goering " had given him a dirty look , but , probably in view of my presence , said nothing . The heckler , who was only visiting in this shed , escorted me out , and we talked for a while in the yard . His name was Arthur and he had been a student of philosophy at the University of Leipzig when the war interrupted his studies . " I hate the Nazis , " he volunteered , " and so did my father ; he once had a close shave when he tried to stop the Gestapo from arresting a couple of Jewish ladies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said , " what do you propose to do about the Nazis ? " " Shoot them , " said the student of philosophy , " or , better yet , hang them . And not with an ersatz string , either . " He explained that he was not the least bit bloodthirsty , but that he would have no scruples when it came to hanging the Nazi leaders . I asked him why he , a Btu- * dent of philosophy and a man of high intelligence , was not an officer in the Wehrmacht , and he replied , somewhat bitterly , that it was because he was not a Nazi . " Even to be an Unteroffizier , " he said , " you have to play ball with the party big shots , and I never did feel like it . I had a desk job in the Kornmandantur for a while and we had a lot of fun canceling the deferments of known Nazis and sending them to the front . My colonel backed me up " ? Arthur grinned ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I chatted freely as we walked up and down the yard . " Why do you think the German army still fights on ? " " Because the fellows feel the Gestapo pistol in their ribs . They fight because they are more afraid of the Gestapo than of the enemy ! " Was that true of the people back home too ? Arthur had no doubt . " Take Berlin , for example . If you walk into a store and say , ' Heil Hitler , ' you can be sure the storekeeper wo n't sell you anything . He probably happens to be out of whatever it was you wanted . And the same goes for moat other big cities . " Arthur was eager to convince me that a large section of the German people felt the way he did . " Did you know , " ho asked me , " that the Nazis had to shoot half of the staff of the famous Rudolf Koch hospital in Berlin ? That nine of ten university professors hate the Nazis ? Are you familiar with the heroic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Nazis ? You must n't despair of the German people . " " All right , " I said . " Let me ask you this : If you were to reconstruct Germany , just how would you go about it ? " It did not take Arthur long to answer that one . " First , " he said , " I 'd kill every Nazi functionary I could lay my fingers on , and while I 'm at it I 'd eliminate the Junkers too . Point two : rally all the good elements and give them full authority  --  the intellectuals , the middle class  --  what 's left of it  --  the churches . Three : get us back on a decent social level ; we do not need all those industries , anyway . Let us be like , say , Sweden , and you 'll see . We can be a peaceful and , yes , a democratic nation . " Was there , then , such a thing as a " good German " ? After leaving Arthur , I had to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Genesis , precedes the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah by the Lord . As in the case of Germany , their cry was great and their sin was very grievous . Said Abraham to the Lord , " Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked ? Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city ; wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein ? " Forty ? Thirty ? Twenty ? Shrewd old Abraham finally narrowed it down to ten . I was wondering , idly , whether Arthur remembered his Genesis too . And I was also wondering what his song would have been if I had spoken to him two years sooner , at the height of the Wehrmacht 's victorious career , when the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah did not seem quite so imminent . Another professed anti-Nazi I rim into was Jochen , an automobile mechanic from the south . " I 've been playing soldier since 1940 , " he told me , " and I never did like it . I first learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ski trooper and belongs to an elite Alpine regiment : his father was a Social Democrat and spent more than two years in a concentration camp . " I knew in 1933 that Hitler meant war , and that war meant defeat , " he went on to say . " The Nazis ? The trouble with them is simply that they have never done a stitch of honest work . They do not want to work ; they want to rule . " Jochen , incidentally , is the only soldier I know of who bought a railroad ticket to the front for the express purpose of getting captured . It seems that he fell in love with a Belgian girl he had met in Antwerp and , after being A.W.O.L. for a while , bluffed his way back home on a vacation train , pretending he was an Italian who did not speak a word of German . Back home , after taking a good look at the bomb damage in his city , he made a decision . A friend employed in Wehrmacht headquarters cut him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Siegfried Line . There he walked into our positions , waving a nice clean handkerchief . In his enclosure , Joe hen associates with a few other boys from Southern Germany who " hate militarism , " and spends must of his time learning English . Before I left him , he sang , for my benefit , the first verse of a new song which , be claims , is popular with the troops . " Those Nazi criminals , " it started , " arc causing the Landser 's death . " How revolutionary is this captive army ? Just how much of a rebel is the German Landser in defeat ? From what 1 have seen and heard , I do not believe that he is likely to become the torch bearer of a European revolution . In fact , his father , who came back from the last war with his rifle slung over his shoulder upside down as a sign of defiance , was probably more of a revolutionary . To be sure , it is difficult to generalize . " Wait till the Allied armies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; " there 'll be a great change in our country . " " What kind of a change ? " I asked . " Will Germany go Communist ? " He had been on the Russian front , and he threw up his hands in horror . " Socialist ? " Not likely . Then what ? The Landser did not know . As in 1918 , this defeated German army is bitter in its utterances against the gentlemen ? " die Herren . " There is a widespread feeling that the Herren  --  and the word includes the Junkers of Eastern Germany as well as the industrial barons of the west  --  have betrayed the German army . " A long war is bad for their pocketbooks , " one Landser told me . " Our defeat was sealed on July twentieth , " another one said , " the day the Herren tried to kill Hitler . " His animosity against the upper classes , however , does not make a Socialist out of a Nazi . On the contrary , it is partly the result of Nazi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeal to the masses , while it fed the Herren themselves an entirely different diet . But the most important difference between the political mood of the German army of 1918 and that of 1945 is that the latter has received its most formidable body blows from the Russian Bear . If there are Communists in Germany today , you will find them , I believe , in the factories and slums , rather than in the Wehrmacht . I met only a few of them among the prisoners I talked with . Even as confirmed an anti-Nazi as Arthur or Jochen , and others like them , will take a line that runs somewhat like this : " Germany can be a good neighbor when it comes to living side by Side with the democracies . We should never have provoked war with Britain and America . But Russia  --  that 's a different matter altogether . We can never be on good terms with those barbarians . Never ! Germany 's eastern border  --  that 's where Asia begins . " I talked with many prisoners who had fought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their bones seemed to go with the ribbons on their cheats . One of them said , " I do n't mind telling you that I am afraid of them . I shudder every time I think of them . I shuddered even when I saw the Russian prisoners in Germany . Terrifying ! " Heretofore , I had met only one set of nationals who had spoken of Russia with an equal amount of sheer physical fear  --  the inhabitants of Tokyo . Time and again , these Landsers told me that an occupation of Germany by British or American troops might be tolerable , but that a Russian occupation would be too horrible for words , too harsh a punishment for the German people . Party liners and professed anti-Nazis were unanimous in their fear , their deep hatred , of the Bear . Every one of them believed that it was Germany 's historic mission to defend the ramparts of Europe against the red tide . That brings us to a most important point : is it really possible to separate those Germans according to their ideology ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I asked American officers as well as enlisted men what they thought the percentage of confirmed NaZia would be among the prisoners , and their replies varied from 20 to 90 per cent . I received similarly . vague replies from the Germans themselves . One Landser , who had been a party member since 1932 , explained that Hitler himself was the only true Nazi . " All the rest of us are merely trying to be good Nazis , " he said . What surprised me was that even the professional Nazis among the prisoners , including veterans of the party and of the Waffen S. S. , seemed always to concede that their Nazi ideology had collapsed like a house of cards . The most plausible explanation , I think , was given by a little shoemaker , himself a party member , who had become a victim of political amnesia . " They are all shedding their Nazi ideas while things are going bad . I know , because I feel that way myself . What 's the use of being a Nazi when you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost all of ' em would be good Nazis again . " Among the hundreds of prisoners I talked with , I met only one whom I would classify as a Nazi ? a 100-percenter , as the Germans say . He was a tall , lanky kid of not more than nineteen , with a lock of strawy hair half covering his brow . I found him brooding by a small fire in one of the emergency cages . He looked up and grinned when I passed by . He wanted to know the latest news from the front . I said he would probably take it for propaganda if I told him . No , he replied , he could always tell lies from the truth . " The Fiihrer gave the order to retreat long before the ' battle of France started , " he informed me . " We never lost an inch of ground we did n't want to give up . " He told me he was a paratrooper , and had made six jumps in training  --  only one in action before he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could tell that he truly believed everything he was saying . " Will Germany win the war ? " I asked . There seemed to be no end to his amusement at my question ; of course , Germany would win , and only a fool could doubt the victorious outcome of this struggle . " But how ? " He shrugged his shoulders . " A German break-through on the Siegfried Line ? Secret weapons ? I do not know ; it is not for us to know . If Germany needs a miracle , sir , that miracle will happen . " Perhaps it is safe to say that there is no such thing as a defeated Nazi . Perhaps the Nazi philosophy is a state of mind which has to be kept up with strong daily doses of victory . All the Germans met , with the exception of the paratrooper , acknowledged defeat . With that , their Nazi Weltanschauung collapsed automatically . But what was there to take its place ? Nothing .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
