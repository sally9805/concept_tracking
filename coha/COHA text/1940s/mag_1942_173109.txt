What did Don Nelson think he was doing ? Did he mean to turn industry over to labor ? Or vice versa ? Management and labor both snorted these angry questions three months ago when Don Nelson asked them to form joint labor and management committees to speed production . Last week the answers were in . <P> With pardonable pride , WPB announced that more than 800 plants with some 2,000,000 workers had formed labor-management production committees ( including 51 in Du Pont , 50 in U.S. Steel , 25 in Westinghouse ) to build morale and to collect ideas for increasing production . Their coverage ranged all the way from 45,000 participants at Douglas Aircraft to 19 in Portland , Ore . ' s Armstrong Manufacturing Co. ( which makes saw-sharpeners ) . Hundreds more joint committees were in the making . Moreover , WPB files were swarming with enthusiastic reports from the field : <P> &gt; Westinghouse Electric 's huge Cleveland plant boosted production 17% in the first month of its War Production Committee . At Westinghouse 's Pittsburgh plant , 48 of the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be put into use . Prime Westinghouse ballyhoo scheme ( besides cash or war-bond prizes for good ideas , which are common to almost all wardrive committees ) : dividing the workers into production teams , each with a " squadron flag " that flies with the Stars &; Stripes when the team is ahead of schedule . <P> &gt; At Douglas Aircraft , there were enough good ideas in the first 500 suggestions to hit the jackpot with cumulative savings of 2,000 man-hours a day-enough to build seven big bombers in a year . A new tooling gadget for milling wing spars cut off 15-20 hours ; a woman war worker in the lacquer department figured out how to save 90 woman-hours a day . <P> &gt; Boeing-whose suggestion box predated Nelson 's plan-announced that it was " swamped with ideas " : in the first four months of its plan , there were 3,554 suggestions , of which 2,842 were " unsuitable " ( not feasible , suggested before , outside the company 's control , etc. ) , 40 were adopted , 672 " under investigation . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $10,000 in war bonds for practicable production ideas . At the tiny Morey Machinery Co. ' s New York City plant ( machine tools ) , one workman figured out how to reduce a 50-minute operation to nine minutes . <P> &gt; In Chicago , Continental Roll &; Steel Foundry has upped production 20% with 200 workable employe suggestions since January . Elgin Watch Co. ( at Elgin and Aurora , Ill. ) has seen its fuse plant zoom to 65% above its production quota in the two months its shop committee has been in existence . Aurora 's Independent Pneumatic Tool Co. has seen a 21% production increase , is hauling in 100 new production ideas a week-and paying for good ones at the low rate of one $5 defense stamp apiece , because the committee asked the company not to pay more . <P> &gt; In most plants , slogan contests are being run as an integral part of the committees ' work . Samples : " Speed the Wheels to Beat the Heels " ( from an American Steel &; Wire sloganeer ) ; " Speed ' Em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 'll Knock You Slap Happy " ( Cincinnati 's Boye &; Emmes Machine Tool Co. ) .
