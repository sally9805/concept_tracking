Three of the world 's leading churchmen discussed one of the world 's great moral questions last week , came to conclusions which , while different , were far from violently so . The question : how should the aggressor nations be treated in defeat ? <P> Catholicism 's Pius XII* spoke of the Reich , where he had served long years on diplomatic missions . Said he : " I will follow developments of postwar Germany with love and , if necessary will give her . . . help . " <P> The Church of England 's second ranking hierarch , the Archbishop of York , spoke too of Germany . In June he had cried : " We are fighting against cruelty , tyranny and treachery in their most detestable forms . That is why we can not agree with the Pope when he coupled together those who commenced the war with those who prolong it , or when he suggests a negotiated peace . " While remaining stern , he ended on a softer note . Said he last week : " For us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against God and man , who still exults in his wickedness and proposes to repeat it when the occasion offers , would mean that we identified ourselves with his crimes . So far from Germany there has come no voice of penitence . There must be repentance before there is forgiveness , though the Christian must do his utmost to encourage and to welcome it . " <P> The Protestant Episcopal Church 's presiding bishop , the Rt . Rev. Henry St. George Tucker , ( longtime missionary in Japan ) , looked toward Japan , urged a more Christian attitude toward the Japanese . He recalled that President Roosevelt had refused the gift of a letter opener carved from a bone of a dead Japanese , that the skulls of Japanese soldiers have been sent to America . " However such actions . . . may have been provoked . . . " he wrote , " they can not but be condemned . . . . " <P> *Last week the Pope was described in a letter from Archbishop Francis J. Spellman of New York to his flock : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and saddened since I had last seen him . Fifteen months of anxiety and pain have taken a heavy toll . No robust physical stature nor strong broad shoulders has the Pope to bear the sorrows of the world , but the Christlike figure , Christlike shoulders and above all a Christlike sanctity and spirit . . . he reminds me of the wounded Christ .
