Last week , as 1940 corporation earnings reports came out , Wall Street 's judgment proved correct on one score : Profits were not keeping pace with production . To steelmakers and railroads , whose heavy capitalizations give them an advantage under the excess-profits tax , 1940 was a banner year ( TIME , Feb. 10 ) . But many a consumer industry found it a year of record sales , record costs , record taxes , and only moderate profits : <P> F. W. Woolworth Co. , with its highest sales volume on record ( $335,474,820 ) , reported its lowest net income ( $24,104,815 ) since dismal 1932 . Besides a $2,400,000 tax increase , the company suffered a $3,317,900 decline in earnings from its British subsidiary . <P> American Can Co. reported sales of $197,515,224 ( up 5% ) , taxes of $11,916,359 ( up 37% ) , net income of $17,440,906 ( down 5% ) . <P> Scott Paper Co. made a sales record ( up 10.2% to $20,397,720 ) . But taxes were up 56.8% ( to $981,973 ) , and net was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preliminary report showed that earnings before income and excess profits taxes were largest in its history , $320,600,000 ( 1939 figure : $228,142,412 ) . So were estimates of its sales : around $1,650,000,000 . But so was its tax bill : $125,100,000 , compared to $44,852,190 in 1939 . So were wages : up 20% to an average of $1,804 for hourly-rated workers . Hence net income rose only about $12,000,000 to $195,500,000 , a figure which G. M. has surpassed twice in the last ten years ( 1936 and 1937 ) .
