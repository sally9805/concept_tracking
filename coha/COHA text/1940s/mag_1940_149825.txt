Last week no cheering mobs chaired Robert Ramspeck on their shoulders ; no medals , no free radio time , no newsreel hullabaloo greeted his achievement . The civil servants of the U. S. do not inspire public frenzy . Theirs is not to do or die , to show imagination or initiative . Theirs is to get to work at 9 a.m. and quit at 4:30 p.m. , like automatons , and to draw their pay until death parts them from the payroll . They are not inspiring Government servants-but they are a lot better than unfit spoilsmen who fill Government offices with ward heelers and live by political preferment . <P> All that Mr. Ramspeck had done last week was to win a final victory for the civil service over the spoils system . It came about because a slender , well-dressed Congressman from Decatur , Ga. , Robert Ramspeck , 50 years old , looking 35 , is a mild , gentle , quiet man who does n't know when he is licked . <P> A year and a half ago Bob Ramspeck went up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bill empowering the President to cover into the civil service by examinations some 200,000 job holders in 26 Federal agencies ; to extend departmental Washington pay scales to the field service . This was something like combined atheism and blasphemy at a religious revival . The spoilsmen got busy at killing the bill . They gave it the works : delay , amendments that subverted its whole purpose , points of order , objections , pigeonholings , pressure . Ramspeck resurrected the measure , answered the lies , used a pulmotor of persuasion on fainthearts , avoided personalities , stuck grimly to the merits of merit . <P> Fortnight ago , the long fight ended in fireworks on the House floor . Gentle Bob Ramspeck , victory in sight , got tough . He took the floor for 18 explosive minutes , with his Georgia drawl grown corrosive , laid about him with two years ' pent-up wrath . When he was through , spoilsmen 's bodies were figuratively heaped around him . In a daze the House passed the bill , 206-to-139 . With Mr. Ramspeck to the White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Presidents who have been harassed to desperation by appointments ; President James A. Garfield , slain by a disappointed office seeker ; perhaps even the shadow of Louis XIV , who said : " Every time I fill a vacant office I make 100 malcontents and one ingrate . " <P> Franklin Roosevelt signed the bill with Robert Ramspeck 's fountain pen . Then Ramspeck cautioned reporters not to expect miracles ; the measure 's full force will take some four years to effect . But Ramspeck estimated that about 25% of those Government workers now employed will fail to pass the required noncompetitive examination , must then be dropped within six months . Thus the Government will slough off some 50,000 workers as incompetent or unfit , 5% of all U. S. employes
