By last week , labor 's dictators of fashions in wage increases had pretty well established the motif for 1947 's high style . The 1947 model for most basic industries will make 1946 's flouncy 18 an hour look skimpy . The new creation is a dramatic , billowing $2 a day ( 25 an hour ) . <P> Some C.I.O. couturiers were already making advance showings . The oil workers , first to display last year 's trend , were out with the 25-an-hour pattern . The rubber workers liked the design , but added a penny 's worth of peplum and made it 26 . The autoworkers were busy with several patterns , ranging from 20 to 35 , but they were all based on the same theme : wage increases must follow the increase in living costs . The C.I.O. thinks that by Dec. 1 living costs will have risen about 25% over last year 's . <P> Unlike the makers of women 's fashions ( see Women ) , labor 's wage designers were sticking mostly to standard models but adding material and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the master of haute couture , John L. Lewis , get to work . As John L. 's underlings sat down with Interior Secretary ' ' Cap " Krug 's underlings to haggle over a new coal contract , it was apparent that John L. had a little number of his own in mind . John L. was putting the wage style accent on a reduction of hours . He was wangling to get the miners as much take-home pay for 45 hours as they now get for 54 hours . John L. was after a contract in which the miner would be paid as much for five days of work as he is now for six days . <P> Those who know John L. 's strategy best credited him with another smart play . The old contract had a clause providing that once wage discussions were begun , the contract could be voided after 15 days of negotiations . Thus John L. could legally strike and , in effect , eventually get a new contract . <P> By getting his wage increase the easier way-in reduction of hours-Lewis would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry will insist upon in contracts for cost-of-living increases . If 1947 should bring a reduction in living costs , many a labor leader would be reminded that escalators can run down as well as up ; industry could insist on cutting wages in relation to reduced prices . But John L. would not be caught in any such reversal . His miners ' hourly rate would not be tied to living costs .
