txt Chevalier Is Defended I was certainly glad to see in today 's issue of THE TIMES the contradiction of the report that Maurice Chevalier had been killed . To those who have lightly and without knowledge condemned him I should like to pass on this last conversation I had with hint in the Rue Daunou in late May , 1940 , when everybocfy in Paris knew that the , first phase of the war had been lost . I was surprised to see him , for the re. : ports had been published that he ' was being asked for in Hollywood and that the French Government had recommended that he should do a " propa ? ganda " film there . Very quietly he answered , " Yes , that is true , but one does not abandon one 's country at a moment like this . " P. J. Pump . Ottawa , Ont. , Aug. 30 , 1944.
