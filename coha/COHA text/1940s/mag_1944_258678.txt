Rumania flip-flopped last week out of the war on the German side into the war on the Allied side . Rumors of Rumanian peace feelers and talks with the Russians and British had buzzed around for months . But the Red Army 's mighty shove ( see WORLD BATTLEFRONTS ) shook the royal palace , jolted young King Mihai and his aging aide-de-camp , General Constantin Sanatescu , into the realization that it was time to stop buzzing and do something . Young Mihai reached first for his Tommy gun , then for a microphone . <P> To Rumanians he broadcast : <P> " A new Government of National Union has been entrusted with the task of ... concluding peace with the United Nations . Rumania has accepted an armistice offered by the Soviet Union , Great Britain and the United States . From this moment all hostilities and other activities against the Soviet armies as well as the state of war with Great Britain and the United States cease . . . . " <P> The new " Government of National Union " included nine generals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Rumania 's major parties : Juliu Maniu ( Peasant Party ) , Dinu Bratianu ( Liberal ) , Constantin Petrescu ( Social Democrat ) , Lucretiu Patrascanu ( Communist ) . <P> Promptly Moscow warned the new Government : " The help of the Rumanian Army to the Red Army in the liquidation of German troops is the only means of speedily . . . concluding an armistice between Rumania and the Allies . " <P> Promptly the new Rumanian Government declared war on Germany . The Berlin radio snarled : " Perfidy . " The Wehrmacht angrily attacked Bucharest ; at week 's end , said Nazi sources , the capital was ringed and cut off from the rest of the country . <P> Among the " unconditional surrender " conditions which the Allies were reported ready to grant Rumania were : independence , recognition of Mihai as King , a return of the big slice of Transylvania which Hitler handed over to Hungary in 1940 . Rumanian troops were already battling Hungarian troops for Transylvania . <P> Young Mihai 's Tommy gun nearly jammed on him . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported to have tried to make peace with the Allies first . Mihai beat his former dictator to the decision and the microphone by little more than the length of his Hohenzollern nose . <P> Rumania 's bolt from the losing side jolted other satellite fence-sitters : Bulgaria 's Foreign Minister Parvan Draganov publicly repeated Premier Ivan Bagrianoffs recent peace bid ( TIME , Aug. 28 ) . Through emissaries in Istanbul , Sofia notified London and Washington that it was ready to surrender . Probable terms : withdrawal of Bulgarian troops in Greece and Yugoslavia , disarming of the few German troops still in Bulgaria . Hungary 's astute Regent , Admiral Nicholas Horthy , dissolved all political parties ( the only undissolved parties in Hungary are pro-Nazi ) , called an emergency cabinet meeting , received an emergency visitor from the Reich , Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop .
