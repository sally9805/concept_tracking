Last week the Spartan old soldier stayed up beyond his usual prompt bedtime : 10 p.m . Not until the clocks in his colonnaded , white-walled Moorish home in Algiers pointed to 11:30 did General Henri Honore Giraud , High Commissioner of North Africa , lay down his pen . He had carefully studied a memorandum from the Fighting French . Just as carefully the General had studied out his answer . There were some points on which he and General Charles de Gaulle of the Fighting French were in agreement . On others-well , wise men move slowly . <P> When General Giraud rose next day to speak to the Alsace and Lorraine Society in Algiers , he knew that the words he had chosen the night before would be heard by the world . On the speaker 's platform were turbaned Arab leaders and the U.S. and British Ministers , Robert Murphy and Harold Macmillan , instruments of pressure for the liberalization of the Giraud regime . Freshly barbered , bayonet-straight in a tan uniform with five stars twinkling on each sleeve , Giraud strode to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jeunesse swung bugles high and blasted a march tune in his honor . <P> Areas of Agreement . Gallantly French was Giraud when he accepted a bouquet from two schoolgirls dressed in the costumes of Alsace and Lorraine . Then , in a high-pitched voice he bitterly condemned the official German incorporation of Alsace and Lorraine into the Reich . <P> Patriotically French was Giraud when he praised the rising resistance inside France to German rule ( see p. 16 ) , when he prophesied the day when " France , battered in her flesh , will have become , spiritually , eternal France , the France of human liberty , of generous ideals . " In effect he denied reports that his North African regime might attempt to superimpose a reactionary rule on postwar France . Said he : <P> " The conditions essential to a free expression of her sovereignty will be restored to France . The people of France will form their own provisional government according to the laws of the Republic . . . . " <P> Logically French was Giraud when he disavowed the conditions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " promulgated without the participation of the French people , and directed against them " ) . He said that Vichy 's anti-Jewish laws " no longer exist , " promised to hold municipal elections in North Africa . He also revoked the Cremieux Decree of 1870 , which granted French citizenship en bloc to Jews in Algeria , but excluded the Arabs . Henceforth , said Giraud , Moslems and Jews must complement each other economically , " the latter working in his shop , the former in the desert , without either having advantage over the other , France assuring both security and tranquillity .
