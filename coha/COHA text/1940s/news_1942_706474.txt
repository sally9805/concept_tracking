txt In Praise of Tippy Larkin One of the ring 's best lightweights is being constantly ignored by the boxing promoters . The man I hold in such lofty esteem is Tippy Larkin , the New Jersey champion in this division . Tippy has scored twenty-one consecutive triumphs , his most recent being a victory over the highly regarded Leo Rodak , who has shown to good advantage in Madison Square Garden on numerous occasions . His poise and ring mannerisms also stamp him as a logical contender for higher recognition in the lightweight group . Perhaps it is not the fault of the promoters and matchmakers , but rather the fighters themselves . There are many who do not relish meeting Larkin . ? PNILIP MANCINI . New York , June 4 , 1942 . Editorial Note : Perhaps one of Tippy 's admirers should speak sharply to Uncle Mike Jacobs.
