txt // the Rites of Passage in that they involve a change in all the relations of the group in roughly the same degree . In the simplest societies , Rites of Passage and Rites of Intensification may be performed within the family system , and in that case the leader is the father or head of the clan . No religious institution proper , therefore , develops , because no new sets arise . Where political institutions have been built up , the political leaders may concern themselves with ritual techniques , and this is also true for economic institutions ; in Tikopia , the specialist at canoe building who directs the actions of his helpers begins each stage in the construction of a canoe by leading a ceremony . In other words , just as we saw in the case of other institutions , the performance of certain techniques , or even the appearance of a set of relations linking the members of an institution to people outside the group does not necessarily result in a new institution . Only when the membership in the sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followers arise , forming a set not coterminous with already existing sets can we speak properly of a religious institution . The characteristic of a religious institution is , therefore , the appearance of an independent set made up of the priest and his followers , and we shall call this the Religious set . When a crisis occurs , the members of the group are no longer in a state of equilibrium . For reasons which we discussed in Part I , they are emotionally disturbed . The techniques which the priest employs in such a situation bring about interaction between them in orderly response to his origins . He leads them in prayer or in a responsive reading , he sprinkles them with water or blood , or brings about a synchronized response to his actions in any one of almost numberless ways ( the reasons for which we shall discuss in Part IV ) . Even where the crisis may not directly affect a person , as in the case of injury to the crops or illness among the cattle , the same principle holds . Among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cattle , the owner called in a cow doctor ( priest ) . The doctor would first ask for a bull or an old cow , and would then drive it all night around the kraal . At daybreak , he brought the animal to the entrance of the kraal , and killed it , cutting its throat and catching the blood in a vessel . Then , taking a bunch of herbs , he sprinkled all of the people who lived in the kraal with the blood . Then he sprinkled the cattle . Once this was completed , he ordered the people out of the kraal , and then drove the cattle out after them . By performing these ritual techniques the priest thus originates action to his clients in set events and helps restore their equilibrium which the cattle epidemic had disturbed . // After performing rites under various conditions , the priest , or shaman , gradually builds up a clientele , or following . This is particularly common after cases of illness , and people who have been cured may continue afterwards the high frequency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the immediate followers of the political or economic leader may originate to others as members of Class B in a set , so the disciples may take part in the ritual activities under the priest 's direction . They may chant , or play musical instruments , prepare the ritual paraphernalia , or in various other ways themselves originate , with a lower frequency , to the disturbed individuals . Once the religious set begins to differentiate in this way , complex religious institutions develop . It is from such beginnings that many of the world 's greatest religious organizations , such as the Christian churches , Islam , and Buddhism have arisen . Such systems appear in one place or another almost continuously . An example of this is the Taro cult which arose rapidly in response to disturbances of equilibrium in the Orokaiva country of Papua Territory , New Guinea , during the 1920 's . The disturbance which evoked it was the arrival of government officials and missionaries in this region , and their attempt to break up the old way of life , and in particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Several religious movements swept over New Guinea as a result . In the Taro cult , which was one of them , the prophet , or leader , was a native named Buninia , who was said to have suffered from epileptic seizures from childhood . This prophet had a vision in which the spirit of the Taro visited him , possessed him , and left instructions for a whole new complex of rites to be used in connection with Taro growth magic . The prophet made his first converts one day as he sat chewing betel nut . He was seized with violent paroxysms and cried out , " Taro , Taro ! " People flocked to hear him , and began to be affected by his movements and began to shake in time with them . After a while he began to harangue them and told them how rites and dances should be conducted to make the Taro grow . The more energetic converts at first went on tours to proselyte distant villages . They began by spreading propaganda about the advantages of the cult and the better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a band of the prophets would exhibit the dances and ritual , during which they would be seized with paroxysms . Some of the onlookers would also succumb , and when they were seized , they would be acclaimed as prophets and taken in as members of the cult . Quite often some individual would invent a variation in the technique of the ritual and his converts would practice this procedure . Occasionally this process , under the influence of some high originator , built up // a sect , and members of different sects began trooping around the country competing with one another in the race for converts . Some of these competitions were almost like political meetings , with members of rival sects trying to outdo each other in dramatic performances and thus get the spectators to respond to their origins . ' In the development of this cult , the set of relations was not built up with a high frequency between the original founder of the Taro cult and his immediate followers who became leaders of small groups . He apparently was unable to develop the kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Salvation Army , by Mary Baker Eddy in the Christian Science Church , and in many other cases . Nevertheless , the rudiments of such a set do exist because leaders in the cult in one tribe are recognized by votaries of the cult in another tribe , and thus the set is made up of a group of leaders originating with a high frequency to their followers , who in turn respond only intermittently to the original founder . With this development , the Taro leaders not only lead their followers in the rituals and dances of the cult , but also have taken over such other activities as making rain , curing illness , etc . Their followers are continually giving them food and gifts , and this extends even to the times when they are traveling in alien territory . With the rise of this cult , there has been a marked increase in the frequency of feasts and dance ceremonials , and the cult seems to represent a compensatory increase in interaction consequent upon the forced reduction in the frequency of ceremonial activities through the efforts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE RELIGIOUS SET The religious leader , as in the case of Buninia , is one who is able to control the interaction rates of groups of emotionally disturbed individuals . In many cases , in the simpler societies , the development of a set may involve violent manifestations of action , such as the epileptic fits to which Buninia himself was subject , but in any case , what is necessary is that the priest have the capacity for getting and maintaining synchronous interaction with thc persons making up the disturbed group . If the disturbance is a minor one , that is , if the frequencies of the interaction have not been too greatly changed , the events involved may be relatively short , and the intensity of the interaction not too high . If the disturbance is a severe one , involving a number of persons , the interaction of priest and followers is proportionately long . // Not only are the events long , but the character of the interaction is such as will have the greatest effect on the autonomic nervous system . This involves the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are much more regular than those ordinarily found in conversation . They may be controlled by the beat of a drum or the sound of musical instruments ; the verbal formulas included in the ritual techniques may be spoken in meter ; or the actions in the techniques may involve orderly postural changes . In any case , action of priest is followed by action of his clientele in orderly succession until . the rhythms have been reinforced by the activation of the autonomic nervous systems of the participants . Anyone who has ever attended a revival meeting of the more evangelical sort in this country has seen how the rhythm of the interaction rouses the audience to such a pitch that they respond in a frenzied chorus to the actions of the preacher . Even in ordinary religious meetings , a similar talent for control of the interaction , a precise adjustment to the interaction rates of the group , is necessary for the successful leader . Those qualities of accurate timing of which Mark Twain spoke in the quotation in Part I are fundamental if the priest is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which will achieve the restoration of equilibrium ( temporarily at least ) in his congregation , the priest must possess a native aptitude for this type of interaction . In many societies , as we mentioned in Part I , individuals who display neurotic or psychotic tendencies become priests . Persons who are unable to adjust to others may seem like the last persons competent to operate in a situation of this sort , but it is just this lack of adjustment which produces its effects . Psychotic or neurotic individuals have much more definite rhythms than normal individuals ; they are much less variable and they are , therefore , capable of the long , concentrated , rhythmic interactions in events which would be almost impossible for a normal individual to maintain except under the influence of drugs . Very often the effect of the rhythms is to produce a state of hypomanic excitement in which the individual is operating almost completely under the control of the lower centers in the brain . In this country , individuals having this property are usually confined to institutions , but among simpler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers , they may be immediately started on the road to specialization as priests or shamans . We have an unusually large amount of information about the way the shaman is chosen among the Chukchi . Usually the members of an extended family themselves select him from their group , and it is clear that in all cases the heir of the family , who is to inherit the reindeer herd , never 1w404 THE DEVELOPMENT OF INSTITUTIONS comes a shaman . Ordinarily this heir is the oldest son , and if he is incompetent in handling the herd he will be disinherited and an abler son substituted . In the Chukchi family system , the possibilities of obtaining a living are very limited for any boy other than the principal heir . He can become a herdsman for another reindeer owner , and by careful tending of the reindeer which he receives as payment for his services , become an owner himself . He can , in some cases , marry his employer 's daughter and inherit his father-in-law 's herd . He can become a trader , exchanging goods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maritime Chukchi . There is no other alternative except to become a wandering adventurer or a shaman . The younger son , therefore , often occupies a position of considerable instability , and the effect of the high origins of action directed toward him by his father and elder brother may result in his developing one of two types of personalities : ( I ) the ermecin , or wandering adventurer , the " violent man , " or " bully " described by Bogoras , a man who originates action to everyone , acting as the fighting man of his family and thus making a compensatory adjustment ; and ( 2 ) the man with a shy , introverted personality , whose origin rate has been inhibited and who is often ( from the evidence ) a mild schizophrenic . Such an individual possesses a capacity for behavior in a catatonic state which will obtain responses from the members of the group , and the violence of his activity often compels individuals to respond automatically if they themselves are mildly disturbed . In the description of the Taro cult at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Individuals of this second type are selected , among the Chukchi and elsewhere , as shamans or priests . Thus in Dahomey , while Herskovits was watching candidates for the priesthood go through one of their ritual dances , an onlooker told him that a female infant who showed particular abandon would make a very fine priestess , since it was believed that people in such a state of frenzied action had been possessed by the gods . ' In many other groups , however , the priest may be selected for other qualities , particularly in the complex institutions where there is a wide division of labor . He may have the capacities of a political leader , or he may be a good administrator . But in any case , whether or not the priest possesses neurotic or psychotic tendencies , he must be able to master the techniques by which equilibrium can be restored to his followers after a crisis and thus maintain his following in a stable system . The Priest 's Training . We are all aware of the length of time ; Ind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to become a Protestant minister or a Catholic priest . The religious leader must learn how to pea // form the ritual techniques by which he is to evoke responses from his clients . In our own civilization , aside from ritual itself , a large part of these techniques consists of sermons and lectures , and in order to give these effectively the priest must study not only religious writings but also the techniques of other institutions to which his clients also belong , so that he may give his discourse the content which will evoke the necessary response . No matter how simple the general cultural level of the people among whom they live , all religious leaders have to go through a considerable amount of training . Among the Andamanese and Vedda , for example , the youth chosen by the shaman as his successor simply follows the shaman about , watches him , and is given , from time to time , special revelations and instructions , so that when the time comes for him to take over his duties he is ready . In the island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a youth chosen because he has passed through a severe illness , the other shamans take him away from his home as soon as he has recovered . They conduct him to a secret meeting place in the jungle in the center of the island , where laymen never go , and here they give him a course of instruction which lasts for several months . Then they carry him about from village to village in a specially constructed litter , until his period of novitiate is ended . In this way he is not only instructed but also placed in a position in which he can attract the attention of the members of the client class in the system , and thus learn to originate to them , and to make them respond to him . Very often the instruction is accompanied by ordeals , which include a period of seclusion . The Creek Indians , who had fairly complex religious institutions , used to make their candidates sit naked , without food , on the bank of a river for three consecutive days . During this time the older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the three days were up the candidates received the lowest degree of shamanhood . Higher degrees required six and nine day periods of privation respectively . In such a system , the candidate receives the bulk of his instruction over a longer period of time and under less rigorous conditions . This period of ordeal is merely the culmination , like our examination period . Needless to say , the state of physiological tension in which he is placed makes him respond with greater intensity than he would under ordinary conditions . In Dahomey , there arc many religious cults , each of which has its own techniques of instructing and initiating its novices . Herskovits witnessed a number of these ceremonies , and describes in particular a practice session // preceding the initiation of a group of five novices in the Mawulisa cult . ' The total period of training lasts seven months , during which the novices live in the cult-house , completely isolated from their families , and cut off from all interaction except that which takes place within the religious hierarchy of which they are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elderly priestess led the procession of devotees . She was followed by a younger priestess of the permanent staff of the temple , and then by some of the older members of the last group of novices to complete their training . Finally , the five new candidates appeared . The procession circled around the principal shrines of the enclosure , stopping at each , and dancing to the rhythm of drums . For several hours the novices practiced dancing in this way under the direction of the priestesses , and this dancing and the procession involve ordered interaction in set events . During their seven months ' period of isolation , the novices not only practice ritual dancing , as described above , but they are rigidly trained in other ways of behavior special to their institution . During this period they have the cult markings scarified on their bodies , learn the special language of the cult , and rehearse songs . Furthermore , they are taught at great length the things that they can and can not do as members of the cult . During this period , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individuals in Classes A and B of the hierarchy , which is one of considerable complexity . They are conditioned not merely to respond in set events almost automatically , but also to develop the special interaction rate char-. acteristic of a priest by suppressing their own origins except during times of ceremonial excitement . ' This is brought about by the inflexible pattern of ritual , aided by the use of the arts , including drumming , singing , and dancing , which , as we shall see in Chapter 25 , precisely control the rhythm of interaction . These art rhythms impose on the individuals who take part in the ceremonies a series of actions and inactions of fixed durations , and this permits a synchronization of their rhythms of interaction . These rhythms , in consequence , have a profound effect upon the activity of the autonomic nervous system . It can be seen , therefore , how important a part is played by these activities in building up systems of relations in religious institutions . . // III . THE DEVELOPMENT OF COMPLEXITY IN RELIGIOUS IN-STITUTIONS The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ societies from simple to complex , a division of labor takes place in all fields of activity . This is just as true of the priest 's profession as it is in the fields of manufacturing , transportation , or political leadership . Among people living on the simplest technological levels , as for example the Andamanese , Australians , and Ona , the only man who is even a part-time specialist is the shaman , and even he has to spend most of his time , like other people , in the pursuit of food . Within the shaman 's profession , however , even at this level , lie the beginnings of the techniques of the physician , the astronomer , the priest and the detective . The shaman restores or maintains the equilibrium of his clients by many techniques . Overtly he cures people by rubbing , sucking , and the extraction of magical substances . He communicates with the spirit world , often while in a state of trance . He predicts and tries to bring about changes in the weather . He smells out criminals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group , by various methods of divination . He conducts most of the ceremonies in his group , which involve serious disturbances and which concern a large number of persons . His multiple duties , therefore , involve an extensive knowledge of techniques , but not more than one man can learn . As the number of techniques increases consequent upon the rise of new varieties of disturbances which upset the equilibrium of the group , priests begin to specialize among themselves . The first division of labor is that between ordinary shamans who are concerned with the Rites of Passage and weather shamans who conduct the Rites of Intensification . The duty of the latter is to restore the equilibrium of the group in the face of droughts or too extensive rains , storms , or floods , or to predict with reasonable accuracy when the seasons will change . Among the Cape Bushmen , for example , there were special rainmaking shamans , held in much higher repute than those who were healers . In time of drought when game was unusually scarce , the rain-shaman would go out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had secured one , he would drag its carcass over the ground with the help of others . Wherever they dragged it , it was believed rain would fall , providing that the ritual had been properly conducted . Throughout the grasslands of the Sudan and East Africa , where rain is of prime importance for the pasturing of flocks and for agriculture , the rain-shaman , or rain-priest , is the religious-official of highest rank , what408 THE DEVELOPMENT OF INSTITUTIONS ever the outward form of the religion . Even among Mohammedans , the heads of the religious hierarchy take over rain-making duties , as is the case with the Emir of Sokoto . In pre-Soviet Russia , where a drought in the summer might ruin the wheat crop of the Ukrainian grasslands , the Orthodox Christian priests habitually conducted rain-making ceremonies . A second cleavage in the ranks of priests is that between diagnosticians and healers . Among such peoples as the Araucanians , the Chibcha of Colombia , the Creeks of the American Southeast , and many of the Negro tribes of West Africa , when a person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examine the patient , and his task is to find out what caused the illness . In case of death , he may conduct an autopsy to find out the cause from the shape of the internal organs , or from the presence of foreign particles . The diagnostician is thus also a detective . Sometimes his report merely consists of naming a person who may , in his opinion , have brought about the disturbance ( illness or death ) by performing evil magic ( ritual techniques ) . Whether or not the accused actually practiced these techniques , the patient 's relatives will deal with the accused appropriately , either killing him or driving him away from the community . Needless to say , the shaman selects someone whose interaction rate has disturbed the equilibrium of the group in the past ; the accusation directed at a troublemaker is plausible and the action taken is satisfying to the group . The equilibrium of the group is thus restored . The punishment of scapegoats of this kind is an important element in many Rites of Passage , as we shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with different institutions , there may be a division among the healers . Among the Omaha , whose war activities involved a complex institution separate from the family , wounds were treated by buffalo doctors , persons who never dealt with illnesses . The Mano of Liberia have expert bone-setters , who do nothing else . In the West Coast region of Africa , there is a great proliferation of ritual specialists ; circumcisers , scarification-cutters , and men who specialize in every recognized disease . As societies grow more complex and numerous institutions arise , priests tend to form their clientele from particular institutions . Some shamans arc primarily concerned with crises within the family , such as those caused by illness ; and hence their clientele is made up of members of families acting as terminal groups . Others develop followings within economic institutions . In Polynesia , for example , specialists developed who were concerned with canoe magic , others with fishing magic , and still others with garden magic . // Among the cattle-raising peoples of East Africa , there were experts who specialized in the ailments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class of specialist handles a narrower field of ritual techniques , and can elaborate within it . When this happens , the chances that they will hit upon some techniques of scientific value become greater . Some of the techniques which they learn to use in this way will serve not only as symbolic mechanisms by which they can restore equilibrium to their clients , which is their primary function , but may actually provide the shaman with medical cures , accurate methods of diagnosis and accurate ways to predict eclipses or to foretell the advent of the rainy season . The performance of techniques of this kind , based on chance discovery and trial and error , formed the basis for the development of many of our learned disciplines . Among these may be numbered pharmacology , surgery , general medicine , astronomy , the development of calendar systems , and much of the higher mathematics . Teaching was also an outgrowth of the duties of the religious leader , and as the empirical content of learning increased , it became increasingly divorced from the practice of ritual . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual is disturbed by a change in the interaction rate of one or more of his relationships , a compensatory movement takes place by which he tries to restore his equilibrium . Sometimes , these movements take place within his existing system of relations , but more frequently , in the life crises , they involve setting up or increasing his relations in a religious set . During a serious illness or upon the death of someone with whom he is accustomed to interact at a high frequency , his compensatory relation to the priest may provide all the adjustment necessary to restore his equilibrium . If that is the case , a permanent relationship between the individual and the priest will be built up , which must be maintained if he is to remain in this state of equilibrium . He will thus need to be constantly near the priest in order to interact with him , and , in short , will become a member of his following . Through his influence , tangent relations may be established between the priest and members of his family , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the other hand , if the stability of the family system is great , the religious disciple may decrease his interaction with the members of his family and obtain his equilibrium by interacting with the priest and other members of the religious system . On the contrary , the pull of the family system may be stronger , and once the crisis is past , the frcelucnry of interaction with the priest will decrease until it returns to // its state prior to the disturbance . In such a case , the priest has served as a transitional , stabilizing force . Out of situations like the above are built the complexities of religious hierarchies . If individual crises are the only ones having any frequent incidence , and groups themselves remain relatively stable , there is little probability that widespread religious institutions will develop . Every shaman will have his following , but he will be a personal leader much like the Mumis , with whom we dealt in the chapter on political institutions . Even if complex ritual techniques arise , consequent upon the development of complexity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of labor among priests is the principal result . In complex cases , several different specialists may be called in , but little more than a processing set with a low frequency will be found , with diagnosticians , for example , originating to healers . At this stage of complexity the clientele interacts with the priests at a relatively low frequency , and there is a good deal of shopping around from leader to leader . The development of complex religious institutions is based not upon crises involving the individual , which are dealt with through the Rites of Passage , but rather upon an increase in frequency of the Rites of Intensification , which are used to stabilize the equilibrium of the entire group . In these rites , the leader originates to the members of the group , conducting ceremonies having to do with the principal sources of livelihood . Among the Omaha , for example , as we shall see in Part IV , the Rites of Intensification involve the principal sources of food , the techniques concerned with hunting the buffalo and raising corn . Among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the priests in charge of the ceremonies , and it is significant that these priests were non-voting members of the tribal council , whose voting members were , as we have seen , the Seven Peace Chiefs , while the healers , who dealt with individual sicknesses , were not . In other words , the members of the tribe terminated in set events both to the Keepers ( priests ) and to the Peace Chiefs . Among the agricultural peoples of Europe and the Near East the great ceremonies were those connected with the planting of grain and the harvest . The Easter services which were common to the cults of Isis , Mithra , and Astarte , and later of Christianity , were the spring-planting festivals of these agricultural peoples . The priests who conducted these ceremonies were , therefore , concerned with the control of complex technological procedures and the institutions in which these were important . The growth of great religious hierarchies , though based upon the leaders who conducted the Rites of Intensification , did not attain the dimcnRELIGIOUS // sions of the cults above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extended the existing system to large groups of people . Ordinarily their rise is associated with the rise of political hierarchies . In some societies , the political leader was both king and priest , but this was possible only in relatively isolated systems such as Egypt and Peru , for any long period of time . In other places , as in England , the king might be the head of the ' state church , but there were other religious institutions independent of that religious system . Once such a system of relations had developed through trade , conquest or both , the ground was ripe for the development of complex religious institutions . Because of the place of religious leadership in the lives of individuals , the rise of religious institutions is associated with periods of disturbance in the systems of relations of people . We have already dealt with an instance of this in the Taro cult of New Guinea ; and the spread of the Ghost Dance and the Peyote cult among the American Indians are classic examples among the simpler peoples . But the cults @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were also dependent for their growth upon disturbed conditions . In the case of Christianity , the first great spread was coterminous with the Roman Empire , and , as everyone knows , it was coincident with the disturbed conditions which ultimately resulted in the fall of that empire . When a church develops on a national or international scale , the need for administration automatically results in a hierarchical control , but the degree to which this is exercised is dependent upon the complexity of the institutions in the groups in which it operates . Since religious hierarchies are based upon the Rites of Intensification , we find that the set events in which the religious leaders originate to their followers occur in accordance with changes in the rate of interaction in the group , the disturbances that result from the cycles of activity imposed by technology and environment . In all religious institutions which have developed complex sets made up of several hierarchical levels , such as the Christian Church , the Tibetan Theocracy , or the Brahman Churches of India , we find daily , weekly , monthly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they may be in the techniques employed and in the symbols used , have in common the fact that they bring about habitual interactions between the priests and the members of their congregations . Within this cycle , there are marked variations in frequency and in duration of the interactions involved , which are consequent upon the importance in amplitude , of changes in the equilibrium of the individuals in the group . In the Christian churches , the length of the services and the number of events taking place within them vary from // the shortened services often held in the summer to the elaborate and longcontinued rituals of Christmas and Easter . Moreover , special services are held on days immediately preceding these great festivals , and the frequency of the events which occur in the preparation for these festivals , including not only the ritual itself but also the activities of the members in preparing costumes , decorating the church , and the like , builds these ceremonies up to a maximum intensity . We will discuss changes of this sort in Chapter 21 , but it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such times it is not only the interaction between the priests or ministers and their congregations which is increased , but also the events which take place between all the members of the hierarchy . In response to the tempo of events , there is a coincidental increase in interaction between the higher classes of the hierarchy , which are passed along the line . At this time the head of the set originates to all below him , thus maintaining his position in the set in respect to all those who terminate to him . The Pope , for example , issues a proclamation at Christmas and Easter , and the faithful in the Church can read his words in the newspapers or hear them over the radio . Within the framework of these regular events in the ceremonial calendar , the religious institution becomes elaborated . Not only does the priest originate in set events in these Rites of Intensification , but he also con , trols in greater or less degree the crises connected with the individual , the Rites of Passage . In most societies , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crises remain outside the religious hierarchy , which is organized around leadership in the Rites of Intensification . In Dahomey , for example , midwives and diviners are not part of the great religious cults . In our own society , doctors and nurses are playing increasingly important parts in the crises affecting the individual . But even so , some part of the interaction involved in stabilizing the equilibrium is performed by religious leaders . In our own society , too , the Rites of Intensification are no longer entirely in the hands of the religious hierarchies . The scientist and engineer start off many events which used to he performed by the priest . In agriculture , for example , the U. S. Department of Agriculture provides technical leadership even though the churches still celebrate the principal agricultural festivals . Nevertheless , the complex religious institution , like the complex political or economic institution , tends to take over more and more control of its individual members . In so doing , sets similar to those found in the latter institutions develop . The religious set becomes elaborated on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set in the political institution . In the Catholic Church , local groups headed by parish priests are // combined into dioceses or episcopal sees , under bishops , and these are in turn combined into wider territories under archbishops . The Catholic world is divided into seventy areas under as many cardinals , all under the leadership of the Pope , who is elected by the College of Cardinals from the hierarchy . ' ( This makes up a limited representative set . ) Over each stage in this system is a head , and the hierarchy ordered in the religious sets forms a series of stages in the Class B of the set ; the Pope is the sole representative of Class A , and the lay members of the church form Class C. The members of this religious set are then differentiated into other sets , particularly in a staff-line set , the members of which are the religious orders who originate to the system of parishes which makes up what is , in effect , the line organization . The religious orders include such groups as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the teachers for the parochial schools and colleges , the missionaries and the research staffs of paleontologists , anthropologists , seismologists , and so on , whose duty it is to keep the church informed of the progress of science and thus enable it to maintain its tangency with other institutions as conditions vary . Between the various divisions of the church there are habitual orders of interaction in the staff-line set which prescribe the relationships of individuals in different parts of the organization . For example , if a parish has church schools , the local priest supervises them directly , but the nuns who make up the teaching force are members of a religious order and hence under the direction of their superior . If a priest wishes a change in personnel in the teaching staff , he must originate to his immediate superior and so on up , until the person who is also over the teaching order is reached , and then down again to the nuns . However , in ordinary matters concerned with teaching he can originate directly to the nuns in set events , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ churches the frequency of events within the various sets differs just as it does in a family or a political institution , and it varies also as a consequence of the differences in the interaction rates of the individuals who make up the system . As a result of the interplay of set and pair events , each religious institution develops a state of equilibrium which represents the adjustments of the different individuals to one another within the institution . These differences in equilibrium are responsible for the variations in adjustment of a religious institution such as a church under the stresses of changes in tangent systems . A few brief examples will illustrate this interdependence , which is part of the general subject " The // Interrelationship of Institutions " which will be discussed in Chapter r8 . In the urban civilizations of Europe during the fifteenth to seventeenth centuries , the rise of economic institutions brought about marked changes in the organization of religious institutions . The economic leaders were accustomed to originate action within their institutions , and they were engaged in a constant struggle with the leaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tangent relations of religious and political leaders was a source of serious disturbance to them in their efforts to maintain the equilibrium of their economic institutions . The result was the Protestant movement directed towards the formation of religious institutions separate from the Catholic Church and under the control of the economic leaders . The forces operating were reflected in the organization of these churches . The ministers were chosen by the parishioners , and in those churches which most completely represented the merchant class , the representative set developed a high frequency similar to that in the democratic type of political institution . Needless to say , the two types of institution historically accompanied each other in the same societies . In some places , as in Tibet , in Rome during the Middle Ages , and in early New England , the church took over the functions of the political institutions . It formed the state because the external relations set included all the members of the total system . When this happened , lay political officers formed staff organizations in the religious hierarchy . Army , police and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This development again , like those just mentioned , was the result of the interrelationships of institutions tangent to the religious system . And in the next chapter we shall consider in more detail how this operates . SUMMARY Religious institutions arise from the establishment of sets in which one individual originates to others in times of crisis to restore equilibrium . These are internal crises and hence the religious institution needs no external relations set ; the basic set is the religious set , between priest or shaman and his clients . The priest or shaman does not lead the people against the members of another group , but he leads them in situations of profound emotional disturbance , the causes of which are usually not understood by the persons involved . There are two kinds of such crises : ( I ) those in which the disturbances are caused by changes in the relations of a single individual to others when he becomes ill , dies , is married , etc. ; ( 2 ) those in which the whole group is affected by some disturbance , as for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes in the environment . In disturbances of both kinds the interaction rates of the people have to change , and the ritual techniques used in these rites , called respectively the Rites of Passage and Rites of Intensification , build up the new interaction rates needed to restore equilibrium . When these two kinds of rites are performed outside the family system we have the beginnings of a religious institution . The religious leader must be able to originate in set events by means of those techniques which have the greatest effect on the autonomic nervous system , such as those which involve a regular rhythm , in music , dancing , verse , etc. , and in which the congregation may respond as emotional reactions become intense . The priest must have these qualities of accurate timing if he is to restore equilibrium , and therefore a priest is often a psychotic or neurotic , among whom these characteristics are often exaggerated . The effect of the priest 's rhythm is to produce a state of emotional excitement in which the individual is operating almost completely under the control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are usually selected for these qualities , and go through long periods of training . In the more primitive societies the priest begins by building up a clientele of followers , to some of whom he may have ministered in illness , while others are individuals whom he has restored to equilibrium in other crises . As societies increase in complexity , the priests , like other people , become specialized ; the first division is between those who conduct Rites of Passage for individuals , i.e. , healers , and those who conduct Rites of Intensification for the group as a whole . These latter are often weather shamans , or rain-makers , who officiate in major disturbances such as those caused by drought . A second split comes between diagnosticians and healers . The diagnostician may not only diagnose illnesses , but he will also in many societies find a scapegoat in cases of major disturbance . For example , when a chief dies he will find some person whose rates cause disturbances , accuse him of evil magic which produced the chief 's death , and have him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shamans and priests specialize more and more , and as religious leaders build up steady relations with their clients , elaborate hierarchies arise , which develop elaborate administrative , and in some cases staff-line and processing , sets . Such an elaborate religious hierarchy may come to regulate the performance of all technological activities of a people , and they may even take over the administration of the state . The rise of great religious hierarchies is usually associated with the rise of elaborate political institutions , and very often the head of one will also be the head of the other . // Associations I. THE DEVELOPMENT OF ASSOCIATIONS Within any institution , the adjustment of the members to one another represents a balance between their interaction rates . When a disturbance from the outside causes compensatory changes in the institution , it tends to return to its previous state of equilibrium once the disturbance is ended , provided that the disturbance was not of too great an intensity nor of too long duration . During the period of disturbance , however , while the members are trying to adjust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upset in the equilibrium of each individual . He is unable to interact at his accustomed rate , and hence is upset . Under these conditions the interaction rates in the system vary considerably as the different individuals in the system attempt to restore equilibrium . This keeps up until the disturbance is over . Disturbances of this kind followed by restorations of equilibrium are so common in every society that they are seldom recorded . Oliver , however , gives us an example from Siwai in Bougainville , as follows . During the preparation for the Social-Climbing Feast , which we have already described , a man named Ho'oma was a very hard and faithful worker . Songi ( whom we have met before ) began to depend more and more upon him , and as a result of this increase in interaction between Songi and Ho'oma , Ho'oma increased his interactions with other natives who had previously been in an equivalent position in the Songi set . Thus Songi gave orders to Ho'oma and Ho'oma in turn gave orders to the other natives . During this period , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Songi 's orders , he very often slept at the men 's clubhouse , returning home only for meals . This decrease in interaction with his family disturbed his wife , who increased her interaction with him whenever he appeared , acting with a high frequency . She railed and screamed at him , and while he was with her they squabbled intensely . After one of these quarrels had disturbed Ho'oma deeply , he went away for a week and interacted only in Songi 's system , in which lie obtained a satisfactory and balanced interaction // rate . During this time , the wife forced her lazy sons to do more work than they were accustomed to doing . As Oliver says , " We would sum up such a situation by saying that Ho'oma had little time for his family , and this change was reflected in changed relationships within the family . " After the feast , when there was no longer any need for his services , Ho'oma slid back into his old routine and peace descended on his family . The trouble narrated above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tangent institution , the Songi political set . Ho'oma 's wife , who was the person principally affected , tried to compensate for the decrease in interaction with her husband by increasing her origins within the family ; to her sons , and to Ho'oma himself when she could get hold of him . Very often , however , people who have trouble in one institution make their adjustment by an increase of interaction in other systems . Thus an American woman who has the same kind of difficulty with her husband might go to the hairdresser 's more often , visit her friends , increase her attendance at church , or join the Women 's Fire Brigade . If a man at breakfast receives a tirade from his wife , who thus originates to him at an unaccustomed frequency , he may speak to no one on the way to his office , and when he arrives there he may order his staff around with what seems to them unwarranted violence . Examples of this kind of situation might be multiplied indefinitely . The point here is that compensation for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of interaction rate in another . So far we have been dealing with disturbances of a temporary character , but , as we have seen in Chapter i6 , there are many disturbances which can not be removed and which bring about permanent changes in the equilibrium of individuals and of systems . The commonest disturbances of this kind are the " crises " which we have previously described , including birth , puberty , marriage , illness , and death . There are many others , however , such as the loss of a job , which puts a man out of an economic institution as much as if he had died ; or a promotion in a political hierarchy which raises him from Class B-z to B-1 , or from B-r to A , etc . When a disturbance of this kind has taken place , there are two automatic mechanisms by which the equilibrium of the affected system may be reestablished on a new level  --  a Rite of Passage , conditioning the individual to new adjustments within the institution , and a shift in the relations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but one institution , the entire burden of readjustment has to he borne by ritual , but where there are many , as in our own society , much of the shock may be absorbed by readjustments in tangent systems . d // For example , if an author 's wife dies , he may compensate for the disturbance in his family system by going on a lecture tour . If , however , the individual in question is a business man and not an author , and if he belongs , as many business men do , to a complex economic institution , his increased origins in the office may disturb other people , and he may lose his job . It may be that there is no other institution in which he habitually interacts that can absorb his change of interaction rate . Then again , let us take the case of a man who has not lost his wife , but has retired from business while still young enough to interact at his usual rate , and with enough money to do as he likes . In this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the amount of action which he formerly originated in the economic institution and which would upset his family system if directed at his wife and children , with whom he is already in adjustment . He must find a system in which to interact or he will be in serious difficulty . Individuals who need to interact with someone to compensate for disturbances in the institutions in which they have habitually interacted , do so along channels already in existence . An individual who finds himself in this predicament will therefore try to find someone with whom to interact , and this person will be someone with whom he has something in common to serve as the basis of interaction . A dog-breeder who moves into a new state or new part of the country will seek out other dog-breeders and join their association ; a man who sails boats for pleasure will try to join a yacht club . As we shall see presently , a parent whose relations with her child are upset may join the Parent-Teachers Association . What this means from the standpoint of our analysis is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relations . Either he will begin to interact at a relatively high rate with individuals with whom he already has tangent relations through a third person or institution , or he will build up such tangent relations through the medium of a common technique . Now when a number of persons have established tangent relations with each other , and have begun to interact regularly on this basis , it is easy for a leader to develop a following on such a basis . The system thus formed is called an association . It must be remembered that , whatever the other characteristics of an association , it is always formed at the point of tangency of several institutions , or of sub-systems within an institution . One of the clearest and simplest examples of this kind of institution is the ParentTeachers Association in almost any American community . Associations and the Tangency of Institutions : The Parent-Teachers Association . In the case of the Parent-Teachers Association we have two // systems : the family and the school ( a sub-system of a political system ) , which are tangent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the children , to whom the teachers also originate . The child , therefore , stands at the point of tangency between the two systems , and the tangent relations are between the parent and the teacher . Quite often the parent may originate action to the teacher by coming to the school to talk over little Johnny 's problems , and in turn the teacher may come and ask the parent why the boy is so badly behaved . Thus between each parent and the teachers of his or her children there grows up a tangent relationship which may involve considerable interaction . Once some disturbance in these habitual rates of interaction takes place , individuals arise who organize the parents and teachers into a habitually interacting group . By so doing , the unstable tangent relations between parents and teachers , which derive from difficulties in adjustment of the school and family systems , are stabilized by the development of a new institution , the Parent-Teachers Association , which restores these relations to a state of equilibrium . As anyone with any experience in these associations knows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interaction between parents and teachers , acts as a very obvious compensatory mechanism . In fact , often the teachers feel that the active membership is almost entirely made up of parents whose children are having difficulties at school . At the meetings of the Parent-Teachers Association , these parents compensate for the disturbed relation between teacher and child , which has in turn disturbed the relationship between child and parent , by causing the latter to originate with a high frequency to the child 's teacher . In most cases , on the other hand , the behavior problems in school represent the child 's attempt to compensate for disturbances in the family system at home . Nevertheless , even though the parents may often originate to the teachers at the Parent-Teachers meetings , a certain amount of adjustment between parents and teachers does occur , which is increased by the fact that both parents and teachers terminate in set events to the officers of the Association . This action has the same equalizing effect that we have already seen at work in religious institutions . Moreover , these associations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the political system , are often able to bring pressure on the school committees or city councils , which in turn brings about changes in the school system . It must be emphasized that the association consists of an organization of people who are in tangent relation to one another ; it does not consist of the people who are at the point of tangency . The Parent-Teachers Association is formed of teachers and parents , and does not include the children // who are both pupils and sons or daughters . Both teachers and parents are in equivalent positions , they both originate to the children in different systems . Associations Derived from the Tangency of Sub-Systems : Labor Unions . All associations are derived from tangent relations , but not all these relations hold between members of separate institutions . In the case of large and complex institutions divided into many ' departments , each of which forms a sub-system , associations may arise at the points of tangency between the departments . A sub-system , of course , represents a group which is quantitatively isolated from other parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the supervisory set , i.e. , the boss of the department originates much more often than any of his immediate superiors to the members of the department . Thus the office employees of a manufacturing company may form an association and go on outings ; they all have tangent relations with one another as fellow members of the production or shop departments in the company . The division into departments , however , is not the only way in which sub-systems develop within institutions , nor is it the most important from the point of view of the size of associations . In many organizations , we find a line of cleavage ( isolation ) at the " work-level , " that is , between the workers and their supervisors . The workers occupy the terminal class in the supervisory set and they are also interrelated in terms of the processing and staff-line sets in different ways . If there is a high frequency in the origins of action by management to workers in the supervisory set , the workers develop tangent relations with each other through the members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Parent-Teachers Association except that the order of interaction is reversed . In the Association , both parents and teachers form tangent relations to one another because they originate , in different institutions , to the children ; in the case of the formation of a labor union , workers in the same or different departments form tangent relations with one another because they both terminate to the same people , i.e. , the members of management . If changes of frequency arise in the relations of workers and management which seriously disturb the equilibrium of the workers , the frequency of interaction in the tangent relations of worker to worker increases and an association results . The institution so formed acts as a compensatory mechanism . The leaders of the union form a supervisory set in which the other members are termini , and an external relations set develops in which the workers originate to management . In such an association , compensatory movements operate through the // sets which have developed . Aside from the external relations set and the supervisory set , an important set is the representative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When origins of action increase in the factory from management to workers , the compensatory movement takes place in the representative set in the unions as the workers originate to their officers , who in turn , in order to compensate , originate in the external relations set to management . Where frequent disturbances in the relations of management to its employees occur , the compensatory origins by the union will be high , and conflict common . But after a period , the conjoint system will attain a state of equilibrium which will differ from factory to factory , depending upon the quantitative properties of the interaction rates of the individuals in question . The stability of the system , and its effect in stabilizing the mutual relations of the two institutions , depend upon the degree to which minor disturbances are dealt with by the leaders of the two institutions . A labor union or any similar association involving tangent relations between individuals who terminate to a common group provides for a single institution the same compensatory system which the democratic , representative system provides for the combination of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Associations and Secret Societies . In the study of associations , the subject of secret societies is often dealt with as if they formed a special type of institution different from associations . This is because of the emphasis in the literature upon the aspect of secrecy . As a matter of fact , the attempt to use secrecy as a criterion for institutional differentiation is of little value . Secrecy implies the isolation of the members of the institution from non-members when the former are interacting . Organizations which require a high degree of secrecy meet in isolated spots or in houses closed to the public , and may very often have special officers who see to it that no outsider can interact with any of the members during the time of meeting . By the use of this technique about which we will have more to say in Part IV , we find that the members of a system are able to interact without disturbance to their habitual rates of interaction . As we shall see in Part IV , organizations which employ this characteristic isolation of its members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habitual pattern of interaction is highly complex and regular . They are ordinarily those institutions in which ritual behavior , which supplies the techniques which induce these complex patterns of interaction , is very common . The fact of the matter is that secrecy , which may be defined as the enforced isolation of the members of an institution during some or all periods of their interaction as members of the system , is not confined to // associations , but is , in fact , present in greater or less degree in every institution . Many activities within the family , as , for example , sexual relations between the parents , are conducted in secrecy . Details of technical processes in economic institutions are very often kept from the public , and political deliberations may very frequently be kept secret . One often reads in the accounts of the meetings of political organizations that before a hearing the committee met in executive session , which means that no outside individual was allowed to be present . In churches , for example , many rites are performed only in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the members of the organization with outsiders . Some of the best-known secret organizations are religious institutions , as , for example , that of the Druses of Syria . Secrecy , then , can not be regarded as a diagnostic of associations , and the confusion that exists in the literature can easily be seen when it is realized that age-classes of boys in Australia going through their puberty ceremonies have been called secret societies , simply because the Rites of Passage include an element of secrecy . Such a label has been placed on other kinds of institutions for the same reason . Associations and " Voluntary " Membership . We can perhaps help further to define associations if we eliminate one more false concept which is habitually attached to them . This is the idea that , by definition , membership in associations is voluntary , and that this is not the case in other institutions . It is true that in many institutions membership is an automatic procedure ; one is born into a family , and residence in a particular area often makes a person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , is usually attained by joining , and that is why it is usually considered to be voluntary . This criterion , however , does not stand up against the evidence from a large number of societies . In some cases , as in Melanesia , adoption , not birth , is the principal factor in determining family membership and on the other hand , there exist associations in which membership sms to be obligatory . This is particularly true in some of the curing societies among the American Indians , where membership in one or two instances seems to be automatic . Another weakness of this criterion is that other institutions , including many economic and religious systems , are also joined voluntarily ; when you buy goods from a shopkeeper , you are a member of his institution . The principal difficulty of using such a criterion as voluntary membership in defining an association is that voluntary membership itself is hard to define . Anyone who responds to the origins of action of a leader in any // institution is , for that moment at least , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ membership in a system depends upon the establishment of a continuous rate of interaction , and the quantitative characteristics of this rate vary in different institutions . In some associations , a single event is enough to make an individual a member . In other cases , a long and intensive period of initiation must be undergone before the individual is considered to belong . But membership in this sense , and , in fact , this is the only sense in which it can be used , can only be defined in quantitative terms , and the amount and frequency of interaction needed for membership varies in different associations , as these associations differ from each other . II . THE DEVELOPMENT OF COMPLEX ASSOCIATIONS The development of complexities in the structure of associations depends on the strength of the forces operating on the individuals who are tangentially related . If a large number of people occupy tangent relations in which they are tangent through relations in the same institution , then large associations will be formed , and they will develop all the characteristics of the institutions we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American Legion . It is made up of local Posts with county , state and national units , organized in the same way as our political system . Within each of these organizations , each having its own officers , there is a number of committees which supervise the activities of the individuals included within that part of the system . Because it depends upon tangent relations through service in the American army during the last war , the membership runs into millions . In such an organization , the same sets found in the political organization are present : representative , supervisory , processing , staff-line , and external relations , all based on tangent relations . The formation of the American Legion was similar to that of other types of institutions . A small group of men started it and built up a following . The disturbance in the equilibrium of the returned soldiers after the war was so great that the association spread like wildfire , much like the spread of religious institutions discussed in the last chapter . Such associations are not confined to our own civilization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which were based on a combination of the exchange of wealth and age-grading , had equivalent chapters in different islands , totally independent of each other politically . These villages and islands were similar in regard to institutions . The same is true in Liberia of the Poro Society ; members of the upper grade could go from tribe to tribe and he received by the members of the equivalent institution , just // as fraternity brothers can go to the house of their fraternity in different American colleges . National associations may , however , split up and separate if the tangent relations between sub-divisions decrease in frequency . At Harvard University , where isolation from other colleges has markedly increased , many of the national fraternity chapters became , during the early twentieth century , independent associations . Here it is to be noted that the most exclusive clubs came to be made up , in large measure , of individuals in tangent relations to each other through the family system , while the less exclusive ones , which remained national in scope , failed to take on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which we have already dealt at considerable length in the case of other institutions . The simplest case is the group of four or five individuals who form a club , or the girls in the eighth grade who are in Miss Jones 's room . The most complex is the association like the Legion or the Masons , with a complex hierarchy involving many levels in the sets and a large number of interrelated sub-systems . Wherever they occur , however , they are dependent upon the need to stabilize the equilibrium of individuals , and they run along the line of tangent relations between members of institutions . They present all the characteristics of other institutions : the struggles for leadership , the development of sub-systems and the splitting off of association from association . They possess , however , one characteristic which reflects their significance for maintaining the equilibrium of individuals . Among peoples where change is ordinarily frequent and associations develop , there is no limit to the number to which an individual can belong . Ordinarily a man interacts in one extended family system , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institution . But if there are many associations , he may , within- limits of his tangent relations and his capacity for interaction , belong to a very large number . Active " joiners " in our society may easily belong to sixty or seventy , in all of which they interact to a certain degree . The implications of such a system in maintaining the sta bility of a total system will now be considered . III . THE DEVELOPMENT OF GROUPS OF ASSOCIATIONS Associations develop , as we have seen , from tangent relations in every institution . Very often two institutions may be involved in the development . Once the process of forming associations begins to take place , we find that a number of different ones will form around many of the tangent relations in a society . This is due to the fact that the formation of an association , while stabilizing the equilibrium between two institutions , may // very often accentuate cleavages in others , and thus create a need for other associations . The process of development in associations , therefore , often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or cluster of associations is formed and brings the total system into a state of equilibrium . In order to illustrate how this happens we shall give two examples : the associations of the Omaha Indians and those of the inhabitants of a small city in New England . ' Omaha Associations . We have already briefly considered some of the institutions developed among the Omaha Indians in the Great Plains of the United States . Aside from the economic system , which we discussed in the Buffalo Hunt , in which the hierarchical organization consisted of the hereditary leader of the Buffalo Hunt and the soldiers , the hunters and the meat cutters , we also saw that the principal division in the political system was between the Seven Peace Chiefs , the Nikagahi Shabe , and the Appointive Chiefs , who obtained their position by giving gifts to the Nikagahi Shabe and were called the Nikagahi Xude . Aside from these distinctions there were also the distinctions between those who had attained no war honors , those who had war honors of the lower grade , and those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Society . On the basis of these systems a number of associations developed , one of the most important of which was the Honhewachi , or Night Blessed Society . Membership in this society was obtained after an individual had made one hundred of the gifts called wathinethe to the chiefs . When a man had succeeded in doing this he was eligible for membership . The heads of the society were the Seven Peace Chiefs , and they conferred the membership on the individual after a long ceremony which largely consisted of the recitation of these gifts , what was given and to whom . As a result of membership in this society , a man had the right to have tattooed on his daughter or some other female relative a sacred symbol of the society , which we will discuss in another place . A girl so decorated was called a Nikagahi Wau , or Woman Chief , and such women played a prominent part in tribal ceremonials . This society , of course , was derived from the tangent relations between the political and family systems , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between a man , his daughter and the Chiefs . Warrior Societies . Two other associations were formed which were dependent upon the war hierarchy . The first of these was the Hethushka So- // ciety , which was the principal warrior society among the Omaha . All those who had taken part in war parties and who had won war honors were members of this society . The other society , which was more exclusive , was the Pugthon . This was made up of members of the Appointive Chiefs , who This association is made up of the members of the Nikagahi tide , or Appointive Chiefs , who are soldiers in the annual buffalo hunt . They originate to members of the tribe as a whole in set events . The segments of the circle represent the ten Omaha gentes , of which the Pugthon members are the leading men . had also won war honors , and as far as can be told from the evidence of the sources , it only included members of the soldier group , whose activities we have already discussed . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the political system , the civil and the military , while the // Hethushka is much like the organization of a labor union which is developed out of sub-systems . Doctoring Societies . One further group of associations must be described . These are the so-called doctoring societies , the most important of which , the Shell Society , did not in fact do any doctoring except among its members . The membership of the Shell Society was made up of the Seven Peace Chiefs and their families . They had a highly elaborate ritual , the significance of which will be discussed in another place , but the ceremonies which involved both men and women were built on the tangent relations between the family system and the political system . Besides the Shell Society , there was one other society of major importance and a number of subsidiary societies which were tied in with it . These were the true doctoring societies , the members of which were shamans who cured the sick . The sub-societies were merely groups of specialists , and they were officially supposed to be open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grizzly Bear , or of whatever the tutelary deity of the society happened to be . Fortune , however , has shown that membership in these societies and in the parental Pebble Society was really dependent upon the inheritance of doctoring powers within the family . ' These societies were built up from the tangent relations between shamans , the patients forming the point of tangency . It is not clear whether the Pebble Society was formed first and the others were the result of internal divisions , or whether the Pebble Society represented the later coordination of these doctoring societies . In any case it is important to point out that members of the Shell Society could not belong to any of these other doctoring societies , and this is in accord with the division between the Seven Peace Chiefs and the Appointive Chiefs , the latter of whom furnished many of the members of the doctoring societies . The Interrelation of Omaha Associations . These associations among the Omaha were formed along the sort of cleavage lines which we discussed in the case of the labor unions , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are interlocked with the family and with political and economic institutions . The high frequency of interaction between the Seven Peace Chiefs produced disturbances in their family systems , since , in cases of crises , they met with great . frequency . Prescribed interaction in the Shell Society was a compensatory mechanism which served to stabilize the equilibrium between the Chiefs and their families . One of the principal lines of cleavage was , of course , that between // the Shabe and Xude orders , which was maintained in the Shell and Pebble Societies . This was dependent upon the fact that the Seven Peace Chiefs , if they had been members of the doctoring societies , would have been placed in the position of termini in the doctor to patient hierarchy , and the high frequency characteristic of this system would , if they had been included , have disturbed the political system . The other principal split came between the members of the doctoring society and the ordinary individuals in the tribe . The disturbance to the doctors came as a result of their clan relations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor through their patients stabilized their equilibrium and strengthened the doctor-patient set . The Night Blessed Society served to stabilize the mutual relations of the Xude group ( the Appointive Chiefs ) , or gift-givers , who interacted in tangent relations with the Seven Peace Chiefs through other individuals in the tribe . It also brought the females into its system , and thus helped stabilize their position in the family in the following manner . A member of the Appointive Chiefs was almost always a man who had " made his count " of a hundred wathinethe , which entitled him to membership in the Night Blessed Society , made his daughter a Nikagahi Wau , and entitled her to participate in their activities . Now the other distinctions of a chief , such as his doctoring privilege and his wealth , were inherited by his sons and could be passed on during his lifetime , but his daughters were in a position no different in these respects from the other women in the clan whose fathers were in no way distinguished . Hence the membership in the Night Blessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many occasions , and thus prevented a cleavage between the- female and male lines . The final group of stabilizing associations consisted of the warrior societies . The Pugthon was an association made up of the soldiers who were tangent to one another through their relations to the Seven Peace Chiefs and the hereditary leader of the buffalo hunt . The embers of this association maintained their relations to one another at a stable frequency during the periods when they were not active in their official positions . The Hethushka , by combining all who held war honors , made a final union of all the warriors in the tribe , for among the Omaha a warrior had to be a householder and not a man dependent on his relatives . Associations in a New England Community . As a contrast to the situation among the Omaha , we will now examine the associational system found in our own more complex society , which illustrates the process by which associations arc formed in all such societies . In a New England community there arc several groups of associations which play an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These associations include the fraternal societies , such as the Masons , Elks , Moose , and Odd Fellows ; the societies organized around tangent relations in economic institutions , such as labor unions , professional associations , the Chamber of Commerce , the Rotary and Kiwanis Clubs ; the political parties ; and the religious and charitable associations . They constitute together a complex system of associations , the variations in which depend on the variations in the other institutions of the society . Fraternal Organizations and their Auxiliaries . One of the most striking characteristics of American associational life is the development of fraternal organizations and their auxiliaries , both of which are characterized by the elaborate rituals in terms of which the interactions of the members are regulated . These organizations must not be regarded as a single type or class of association , since they differ widely in many other respects . Their interest to us here lies in the fact that we can use them as convenient examples to show how differences in the frequencies of sets in the family may be carried over into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which can be carried over in this way are the male and female sets , in which , as we have seen , males and females originate in set events to one another . Auxiliary organizations are formed through the agency of these sets , as follows . First a men 's organization is formed , and this produces marked modifications in the family systems of the members . Much of the men 's interaction takes place inside the fraternal organization , and this decreases the amount of interaction between men and women in most of the members ' families . In these families , the women whose husbands or sons belong to the same fraternal organization are thus tangent to one another through this association . These women tend to form an association of their own , i.e. , an auxiliary , and the increase of interaction within this association serves to stabilize the interaction rates of the women . Two points concerning the formation of auxiliaries in New England communities are particularly interesting . The first is that they are a rather recent development , and the second is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These two factors are derived from the changes in the family system which have been going on in our civilization as the result of its adjustment to new economic institutions , as we shall explain shortly . In the first place , auxiliary members are usually either single or childless women or the mothers of grown children . In other words , the women who take active parts in these organizations are those who are not engaged // in the ordinary activities of life , notably the care of children . In the case of a woman with children who have grown up and gone away , the marked reduction of the interaction with her children in the parental set has disturbed her habitual equilibrium . Such a woman is faced with two alternative avenues of compensation in her relations : ( I ) her husband , and ( 2 ) existing tangent relations . The auxiliary stabilizes her equilibrium in both of these directions . Organizations which consist of a fraternal association and its auxiliary involve a habitual interaction of males and females in set events . These utilize various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the auxiliary will prepare meals for joint meetings of the two associations , and at these meetings contests between the men and the women are commonly held , to see how well the men can perform female tasks and vice versa . By using such techniques to build up origins of action between members of the two associations , the members of each increase their interaction within their own organization . In the system of regular meetings , held separately , in which a regular order of events is followed , the equilibrium of each organization is further stabilized both internally and in respect to its linked organization , and thus the rates of interaction within each of them and between the pair become constant . The Development of Female Organizations . The rather recent development of these auxiliary organizations seems to result from the changes in family equilibrium which have been widespread in the United States , and are due to the following two factors : ( I ) the reduction in the interaction required in the performance of family techniques through the introduction of labor-saving devices , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater opportunities for individuals to become members of economic institutions outside their own communities , due to the increased facilities for transportation and communication . Also , of course , tie opportunities for employment in the home community have decreased , since improved systems of transportation and communication not only create a greater mobility in occupation but also the concentration of economic institutions in large units in specialized areas . In the old days , people almost always worked within their communities , and , therefore , when a man married there was not such a sharp break in his interaction with his parents as now when he works elsewhere . This continuity of residence made it possible for the family system to readjust itself after the disturbances in equilibrium resulting from marriages without too much compensatory interaction in tangent relations . During the last forty years , the development of these auxiliary organi432 THE DEVELOPMENT OF INSTITUTIONS zations has followed a very interesting sequence . They began to be prominent among families whose members were employed in the lowest class in economic institutions . In these families children went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group , they married earlier , and were more often employed outside their native communities . This situation was followed within two decades by the development of auxiliaries among families in the lower ranks of the supervisory hierarchies in economic institutions , and among people who were the heads of very small retail institutions . This developed during the period in New England when the local ownership of economic institutions began to go out with the merging of corporations which lasted until 1929 . Finally , at about this time , members of higher management groups and the professional men in such organizations as the Rotary Clubs were also affected by the changing economic system , and their wives found their relations similarly changing . The men 's clubs to which those individuals in the highest brackets , financially , in hierarchical positions , etc. , habitually belong have not , however , developed auxiliaries . Their wives and daughters belonged to women 's clubs long before the auxiliary movement started . Since these women usually employed servants in their houses , the changes in modern conveniences made little difference to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by nursemaids in the afternoons . When they reached their middle teens the children were usually sent off to boarding school , and thereafter their visits to their parents ' homes were usually sporadic and of short duration . Hence there were no sudden changes in the interaction rates of these women , but they had time to interact outside the family both before and after marriage , and furthermore , and this is of considerable importance , they had many kinds of tangent relations with women other than those they knew through their husbands . Hence there was no need for their women 's clubs to be linked to male organizations . Furthermore , they participated in many of the same activities as the men , particularly in sports , and for this reason belonged to many mixed associations . Mixed Associations . Mixed associations , to which men and women both belong , are not the exclusive property of the so-called leisure class , but may be formed wherever men and women interact frequently together . Besides the higher-bracket clubs , in which there is usually little formality , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conducted with much ritual , notably fraternities and their auxiliaries . The most important of these is the Grange ( the Patrons of Husbandry ) , an association in which families having a similar state of equilibrium are united through tangent relations to other institutions . // The relationship between man and wife in a farming family is necessarily different in interaction from that of urban dwellers . In the type of family that produces the auxiliary system , the man ordinarily is away from his home at his job during the greater portion of the day , and except when he is not working he sees his wife and children only in the early morning and evening . The daily routine of existence in such a family does not involve many techniques in which husband and wife interact . In a Cirming family on the other hand , although the man may be working in the fields a large part of the day , there is a much greater amount of family interaction , particularly in the winter . Moreover , the children very soon begin to work on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is a decrease in the interaction rates as the children become independent , the resulting family system shows different lines of cleavage from those found in the city . In these families , the man and wife are not separated and the line of change in interaction rates comes between parents and children rather than between mothers and children only . Charitable Associations . One other important variety of association is characteristic of a New England community ; this is the charitable type of organization , which includes Societies for the Relief of Aged ; Men and Women , the Community Welfare Association , the Red Cross , Societies for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children or Animals , the Hospital Aid Associations , Library Association , the Anti-Tuberculosis Leagues , etc . These organizations are based upon the origins of action made by individuals within the association to individuals or groups outside it . They serve to stabilize the equilibrium between the two classes in the s thus formed . Indigent families are helped by gifts of food , clothing a money , and members of the interested association @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beneficiary is operating . In this way , many of the activities of a Mumi or a political leader are taken over by associations , which develop as specialized institutions whose members are able to maintain their origins of action in the society as a whole . The recipients of favors in this type of institution form a fluctuating Class C , comparable to the enemy in a military organization and the customers in a trading institution . In many cases these associations have highly developed hierarchies both within each local district , and by combining communities into county , state and national institutions . Their importance , however , lies in the fact that there is a continual series of origins going from members of the association to those whom they help , and in general this system of associations originate action to special groups of people in much the same way that various departments in the political organization do . These associations are built up // in much the same way as the doctoring societies among the Omaha , that is , they represent the development of tangent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terminators . As a result of this process by which some individuals develop a clientele among the poor , the ailing or the sick , a number of specialized associations of this type develop . They are based upon all the crises in the relations of individuals where disequilibrium develops . IV . ASSOCIATIONS AND THE MAINTENANCE OF EQUILIBRIUM IN COMPLEX SOCIETIES In every society where associations are found , they provide us with an excellent way of locating the lines of cleavage which mark the areas of instability in institutions . The proliferation of tangent relations and their extension in associations are important factors in maintaining the equilibrium of a complex society . In the next chapter we shall- discuss in detail how the interrelationships of institutions make up a total system in equilibrium . We shall see there how , just as in the case of individual institutions , the combination of institutions that makes up a society is also in a state of equilibrium . However , it may not be amiss , now that we have described the associational systems of the Omaha and of a New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the totality of human relations in relatively complex societies . Every individual living in a complex society will ordinarily belong to one or more associations , and his equilibrium , therefore , consists of his adjustment in family , economic , political and religious institutions , and in the associations , themselves institutions , which stabilize the relationships of these various systems . In the process of adjustment , an individual may join a number of associations , and in some of these he will find that he is able to build up satisfactory relations with other individuals . In others , in which the interaction does not help to balance his system of relations , his maladjustments may be accentuated , and if he is to restore his balance , he must drop out of these associations . As times goes on , every individual undergoes changes in his relations as the individuals with whom he interacts change under the effect of crises . Individuals and institutions are , therefore , continually in a state of mild disturbance and readjustment , and in this process the part played by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the other institutions , family , economic , political and religious , people die , move away , and change their position in the hierarchy . In response to these alterations , people join new associations and drop out of old ones , become active or in- // active in them . In many societies the process of adjustment in associational institutions goes on continuously . Just as other institutions are , as we have seen , subject to the formation of new sub-systems and the growth of departments and divisions , so with associations the same process goes on . Some of the large associations break up into small ones , sub-systems form within others , like the 40 and 8 of the American Legion , and a continual process of splitting up and regrouping into larger associations is in progress . The rate at which these adjustments take place indicates the degree of stability of the society as a whole , and the number of associations in it is a measure of its complexity , since no associations at all are found in simple societies , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutions in which individuals interact increases . V. CASTES AND CLASSES : HIERARCHICAL DIVISIONS CROSSCUTTING INSTITUTIONS A further development on the basis of tangent relations in many complex societies of the world is the so-called class system in which all the members of a class irrespective of the institutions to which they belong originate to members of another class who terminate regularly to them . All through Europe in the Middle Ages the three classes , nobles , commoners , and serfs , could be easily distinguished by their habitual behavior to one another . These classes were roughly based on lines of fissure in habitual rates of interaction comparable to the " work line " mentioned in the development of unions . In most European countries , such classes continue to the present day . In England , for example , although there is a representative type of government , the continued presence of these classes has prevented the development of a completely democratic system . This was the case in the United States one hundred and fifty years ago . Some of the Founding Fathers had grave doubts about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political control to " gentlemen . " Class distinctions have steadily disappeared , contrary to the beliefs of some authors , since that time . In a few places , the language of class is still in use , but the small groups of people still holding to it are unable to get responses from those they consider their inferiors , except within specific institutional frameworks . Probably the most complexly differentiated societies in the world are those of the so-called caste system which is found in India and also in parts of Africa , such as the western Sudan . In India , which is the classic home of the caste system , there is , according to popular belief , a continuously graded series of endogamous groups each of which practices a single occupation . These castes arc supposed to have become differentiated as a result // of the Aryan invasions and the repugnance of the conquerors at mingling with their inferiors . Just how much this theory amounts to , and how it can be supplanted by a more rational explanation , may be determined by a study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ India . ' In Cochin , the people are divided into groups of so-called " castes , " each of which is endogamous , and is subject to the leadership of a council of head men who administer its affairs . Each of these castes , therefore , is an endogamous kinship group which is similar in structure to some of the clans which we have already described in Chapter 13 . So far there is nothing unusual about them . It is , however , the relations between these castes that has given rise to the speculation mentioned above . In the first place , the interaction between members of different groups is highly formalized . In some cases all interaction is prohibited , and one group is considered to pollute the other if the members converse or touch each other . In other cases , the members of two groups may go so far as to eat together , while in still others they may even intermarry . On the basis of these distinctions in the on the strength of such criteria , claim that they are superior to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is little correlation between the various criteria which are considered to designate caste groups . For instance , two groups who may eat together may or may not intermarry . Although , in general , groups which pollute each other do not intermarry , groups which do not intermarry may or may not pollute each other . In contradiction to the general belief , only fifty percent of these groups have a common traditional occupation . What seems to have developed here , and in other parts of India as well , is a series of groups whose members interact with each other within their organizations in much the same manner as do the members of associations in other societies . Two factors are important in differentiating castes and associations . The first is dependent on the type of political institution ; the members of all of these castes respond in set events to the origins of a ruling class . The second involves the interrelations of family and association due to the high frequency of interaction of the former ; there is a tendency for the caste to become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough time , and thus to become a complex family system . As numerous writers have shown , the development of caste groups in India as part of the spread of the political and religious hierarchies in that area has taken place in two principal ways . One is the absorption of the // " aboriginal " tribes into the caste system . These tribes were originally endogamous , being composed of a number of exogamous clans . As they were drawn into the Hindu system , many of these tribes became castes almost overnight . The other is the creation of new castes to take care of new techniques . Thus when the new occupations of electricians and trainmen arose in India , the men who took over these jobs were at first selected at random , but they soon formed associations of their own , caused their children to intermarry , and within a very short period had formed castes . In other words , castes in India are associations based upon the tangent relations between economic , political , and religious institutions , which are combined with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family sets have a high frequency and ultimately supersede the sets of which the association was originally formed . In cases where family groups are taken over from outside the society , they are able to keep more or less their original form , but are subject to division into subsystems in accordance with the tangency of the members to other systems . The general belief that these castes are hierarchically arranged into a stratified society , each of which has its own special place in a kind of " peck " order , is based upon a mistaken notion as to what constitutes a hierarchy . There is no definite gradation in which each caste originates only to those below it , and only responds to its superiors . Nor does each caste necessarily occupy the same position in each of the institutions , political , religious and ' economic . One group may flatter itself by saying that it is not as others are , but that does not mean that all would agree to its claims of relative superiority . If one were to obtain adequate data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example , it would probably appear that below the Fula themselves , who are political overlords , and the Diwambe , who are the merchants and the Fula 's immediate henchmen , the many different groups of farmers , fishermen , iron-workers , tanners , musicians , and the like , into which Sudanese society is supposed to be divided , are really members of endogamous associations in some cases , and in others native tribes which have been taken into the system as units . That the latter is indeed the case is evidenced by the fact that some of these castes have separate languages . There is no need to multiply examples of the caste system , except to state that it is also in operation in Southern Arabia , and in Hawaii , Samoa , and some of the other more complexly organized Polynesian Islands . Let us now return to the subject of the class system proper , and see what the conditions are under which these classes may arise , or may be considered to arise . In the first place , every complex society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are found in it are made up of sets of relations in which one person originates action and others respond , and there may be several classes , of individuals arranged in sets in any institution . We have already seen how extensive hierarchies develop in economic , political , and religious institutions ; in such institutions men who are at the bottom of the administrative set in one organization may very likely be at the bottom of a similar set in another , and men at the head in one may be at the head in the others . As a result of this , tangent relations often develop between the individuals who are all at the bottom , and between those who are all at the top . For example , the political leader will go to the manager of a factory and ask him if he wo n't let his workers off ten minutes early that day to attend a political rally , while two workmen will go together to the motion pictures in the evening . When habitual interactions of this sort develop , groups of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arise through the mechanism of tangent relations . If stress situations develop , these cliques may , as we have seen , become institutions . Cliques are non-institutional associations because they have but a single set , consisting of one or more leaders and their followers . Membership in cliques and associations is not diagnostic of a class system . To have the latter , the members of Class A above the line must interact with a high frequency with each other , and the same must be true of the members of Class B ; while the interaction between A and B must be low and A must always originate to B in set events and B only respond . A further postulate of this theory would be that membership in these classes may be clearly defined and precisely known , i.e. , that each class forms a system . The extent to which this situation obtains varies without doubt in different societies . In our own society class distinctions have been well demonstrated in the Southern states between whites and Negroes . Here there is a clearly defined set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high frequency and the Negroes are not allowed to originate to the whites in set events . This situation is , of course , the result of the importation of one group of people into an area by a group which was politically and economically dominant , rather than a case of the emergence of classes from a common level , as explained above . In the case of the Negro-white situation , the fact that there are very marked physical differences between these groups to serve as symbols of identity , makes it difficult for " mobility " from one to , the other to take place . This may be contrasted with the situation in Greece and the Roman Empire , where slaves could not be so distinguished and in which the mobility was by contrast very great . // Aside from this relationship between whites and Negroes in the South , it would be difficult to prove the existence of social classes in the United States . One might contend that those persons whose names appear in the Social Register or in Who 's Who formed the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was made up of all those persons whose daughters belonged to the Junior League , or who sent their sons to certain schools . It is no doubt true that cliques do form on such bases , and that members of some cliques have relatively higher positions in the hierarchies of some institutions than the members of others . But no true social classes exist in a society such as ours , because a man who is a member of the Class A group in one set will belong to Classes B and C in others . A young man with what is considered the highest possible background will usually have to start at the bottom in a business office , and if he is drafted into the army he will have to begin as a private . The young men who are sent to West Point and to Annapolis to train to become officers , on the other hand , are selected from every rank in the different hierarchies of our society , and from what those who consider we have a class system would call all classes . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they are better than others , as we have already seen in the case of the caste system . A member of a Woman 's Club may consider that the activities in which she and her fellow-members indulge are definitely superior to the activities of an organization such as the Mooseheart Legion , but she can not originate action habitually to the members of the Mooseheart without their originating in turn . Moreover , the fact that the members of the Woman 's Club may not interact with members of the other organization might equally well be considered a sign of the superiority of the other organization . The feeling of superiority is a rationalization based on the fact that in a tangent system the husband of the Woman 's Club member may originate action in the administrative set to the husband of the Mooseheart member , i.e. , he may be his boss , but the situation might be , and often is , exactly the reverse . No classes in the English sense exist in this country . In the words of Abraham Lincoln , " There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago , I was a hired laborer . The hired laborer of yesterday labors on his own account today and will hire others to labor for him tomorrow . Advancement  --  improvement in condition  --  is the order of things in a society of equals . " // names for sets in different institutions . It should be emphasized that the use of the same name , for example , the administrative ( supervisory ) , or the staff-line or processing sets , does not mean that the same individuals are to be found in each set . It should have been obvious that a processing set in a religious institution , composed of priests , does not include the same persons as the processing set in a shoe factory . We have used the same names , rather , to indicate that within all these institutions there is a basic similarity in the arrangement of the sets in reference to one another . Each of these institutions was composed of a leader ( often with subordinate leaders ) and his followers . In the family , the special biological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the religious institution we called it the religious set . In the other cases we called it the administrative , or alternatively the supervisory , set . Within such an arrangement of a leader and his followers in a set , other sets developed which involved different arrangements of the membership of this basic set . These were the processing sets , so-called because they involved a division of labor usually caused by technology resulting in set events among the members of the supervisory set , and a staff-line set in which other individuals originated to the groups differentiated out by this set . In the family , the male and female sets are analogous to these two sets . Other sets include the age-grading set , the representative set found in associations , religious , political and economic ( stockholders to officers ) institutions , and the commercial and the external relations sets , found in all institutions . Some sets may be regarded as diagnostic of institutions , but only in a very rough way . An association is differentiated on the basis of tangent relations , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are fairly easy to identify , but the others present more difficulties . The chief difficulty arises not so much in the fully developed cases of complex societies , but rather in those cases in which for reasons of isolation or competition , an institution develops a number of sets ordinarily found as parts of different institutions . It then should be regarded as a complex institution , though an examination of its history will show the type of institution out of which it has developed . A family , for example , may develop an external relations set and , like the Hottentots , become a state . A religious institution , as in Tibet or in Rome during the Middle Ages , may similarly develop such a set . It , too , then becomes a state , and we speak of a theocracy . Such examples represent extreme specializations , and they also indicate why a particular set can not be selected as an unerring diagnostic . The only systematic way of differentiating institutions is by member- // ship in Class C of the most inclusive set in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to determine the number of institutions in a group , start with the family and determine its membership . If there are then individuals who do not belong to a single system , is there any set of relations , such as the external relations set , in terms of which they are organized , and so on ? This process of determining the membership in institutions involves seeing whether what are thought to be separate institutions actually have a set in common ; if they do , they are of course the same . Institutions can not be distinguished from one another in terms of the frequency of interaction which goes on within them . Some associations , for example , meet but once a year , as , for example , the Harvard Class of 1925 Association , which is composed of men tangent to each other through membership in that class ; other associations may meet every night , as , for example , some athletic associations . Equal variability is true in all other kinds of institutions , even families , in which members may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who belongs to a number of institutions strikes his own balance of interaction between them , and this varies greatly between persons . SUMMARY Within any institution the adjustment of the members to one another represents a balance of their interaction rates . As crises arise these rates will be upset . In such an event there are two ways in which an individual , can I restore equilibrium in an institution : ( 1 ) by taking part in a Rite of Passage , and ( 2 ) by changing his rate in other institutions by way of compensation . Where a society includes but one institution , the former is the only possible outlet . But even where there are several institutions , it may happen that a person can not make his adjustment for a disturbance in one without upsetting another ; hence he can secure this adjustment only through tangent relations . People who have tangent relations to one an442 THE DEVELOPMENT OF INSTITUTIONS other both interact with a third person . Thus yachtsmen form a club , parents and teachers form a club because both originate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same bosses form a union . People who have tangent relations with one another may form a separate system in which to interact , and by shifts of interaction rates in this system they can make their adjustments to disturbances of equilibrium in other institutions . These systems formed at the points of tangency in the relations of systems and sub-systems are called associations . Associations vary greatly in complexity and in numbers of sets . They may have administrative , representative , staff-line , processing , etc. , sets , depending on the basis of interaction of the association in question . The number of associations to which a person may belong is unlimited ; he belongs ordinarily , however , to but one family , one state , one church , and one main economic institution . The number of associations in a society is an indication of its relative complexity . When one association arises , another may also arise which is tangent to it ; e.g. , a Ladies ' Auxiliary made up of women whose husbands belong to another association . This compensates for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meetings . Women who join auxiliaries in our society do so mostly when their children are grown up and the family interaction has been reduced ; also the reduction of housework due to the introduction of labor-saving machinery is a factor . Associations in which only males or females are found occur where institutions to which they are tangent are also one-sex systems , such as the army or a machine shop . When members of a family do their daily work together , as on farms , they will also belong to mixed associations . Another kind of association is the charitable association , in which the members originate to the poor , who form the point of tangency . These associations serve to maintain the equilibrium of the whole group . Castes , as they exist in India and elsewhere , are in some instances associations of people performing the same techniques who are or come to be in tangency with the same institutions , and who then intermarry and form endogamous family systems . In other instances they are composed of members of a native tribe which has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unit . Castes are not the same as classes . Classes exist only where members of one group of people originate to members of another in all set events in which both take part , and where members of the second group respond to the first in all cases . The position of the individual in associations is an index of general social status but does not indicate a class system . // The Interrelationship of Institutions THE PARTICIPATION OF INDIVIDUALS IN DIFFERENT IN-STITUTIONS In the previous chapters in which we dealt with separate institutions , we found it necessary to regard each institution , for the moment , as isolated from all others , in order to study the particular way in which the relations of which it is composed are organized . In so doing we were obliged , nevertheless , to consider how tangent systems might serve to modify its structure in each case . In the last chapter particularly , in dealing with associations , these tangent relations had to be considered at length , since it is upon tangent relations that associations are based . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Institutions do not exist in a vacuum ; they are made up of individuals who , in a complex society , are at the same time members of other institutions . In the United States , for example , a man begins the day by interacting with the members of his family , his wife , his children , and possibly other relatives such as his brothers and sisters , his mother or father , or his wife 's parents . This interaction continues until he leaves the house after breakfast . He may work in a factory , and there he will interact in prescribed and habitual ways with the assistant foreman , the foreman , and the men working with him . As a member of the union , he may report to his shop steward about the way the foreman is making him clean his machine . During the noon hour he may eat in a restaurant , where through his interactions with the waitress , cashier , and proprietor he becomes a member of a retail institution . He may then go to a Five and Ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus he takes part in another institution . Returning to work in the afternoon , he again takes part in the factory hierarchy , and then returns to interact once again in the family system . After supper he may attend a meeting of his lodge , or , as a member of the political institution , attend a hearing of a committee of the city council on the request of the Telephone Company for permission to erect a pole in front of his house . Each person interacts in different institutions not only during 443 // the day , but also on different days of the week . The Legion meets on one night of the week , and the Elks on another . On Sunday there is church , to which the entire family may go , responding there with the congregation to the origins of the minister . This elaborate sequence of institutions in which a man interacts during each day is not the only complexity in his daily life : his interaction rate differs markedly in each institution , and the events in which he interacts differ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Ten may have involved only a single event lasting a few minutes , while his job in the factory may require him to work as a member of a team throughout the entire day . Not only do these events differ in length and frequency , ' but the order of action and degree of synchronization within them also differ widely . The foreman may originate action to him fairly often during the hours of work , although this rate will fluctuate considerably from day to day . In this relationship the workman will limit his actions for the most part to short replies , waiting carefully until the foreman ceases talking . When he goes down to the club in the evening , he and another member may " yarn " contentedly throughout the evening , and here he maintains a satisfactory interaction rate . Or as an officer of the club , he may harangue the members to get them to decide on the kind of entertainment which they shall provide when they are visited by the county officers . Out of these many events , which have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equilibrium is built up , and this equilibrium represents the adjustment of the individual to these various stimuli . When a person begins to interact in a new institution , he does not leave behind him the effects of the other institutions in which he has just taken part . The organism continues to operate without regard for these boundaries ; in fact , there is a definite carry-over from event to event . A man who has had a quarrel with his wife arrives at the lodge meeting in an impassioned state and compensates by haranguing the members . The salesman who has been interacting all day comes home at night and sits in his chair and reads the paper and answers his wife 's summary of the day 's events with barely perceptible grunts . It is of such individuals , each one oscillating in his adjustments to the varied individuals with whose interaction rates his own are more or less synchronized , that institutions are composed . The Equilibrium of Tangent Systems . In our discussion of institutions we have shown how interactions between individuals occur in regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amounts of interaction . The same thing is also true of relations between in THE // stitutions . We have just described how an individual might find himself in several different institutions in the course of a single day , and this kind of situation is , of course , one way in which the institutions are related to each other . But here we propose to discuss the way in which systems tangent to each other are in equilibrium , and this will involve a consideration of some of the examples we have already given . In our analysis of economic institutions , where we saw that the utilization of techniques of manufacture in Riffian or Melanesian families was associated with the development of an economic institution involving a trader and his customers , we had to consider tangent systems . It is easy to see that there is a direct functional relationship between the frequency of events in the family and the events in the Trader-Customer system . Any change in the frequency of interaction between the members of one system produces a change in the other . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same habitual sequence of interactions is found . The attendance officer in an American school system , for example , makes regular visits to factories and stores where children under sixteen years are employed , to see whether regulations in regard to the employment of minors are being observed . If any violations are detected , he reports them to the superintendent of schools and also to the State Department of Labor and Industries . Similar examples have already been discussed in dealing with the relations of other institutions , particularly in the Associations chapter , where the entire associational system was shown to have developed out of tangent systems . How Adjustments are Made Between Institutions in a Society . If we wish to understand the systems of relations which make up a society , we must study not only the adjustments which have been developed between institutions as they appear at the moment of observation , but also the process by which these adjustments have come about and by which they work over a period of time . Both are necessary and interdependent . The adjustments within institutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way in which we can tell whether or not they are in a state of equilibrium is to find out , over a given period of time , whether their interaction rates are constant , and whether they possess the property of returning to their previous state after they have been disturbed . Only by studying changes in time can we learn the amount of change that takes place in a system in equilibrium as a result of a disturbance of a given magnitude . This will vary considerably between the institutions in a society , because the equilibrium of a society is itself a state of equilibrium between systems , // which are themselves in a state of equilibrium , and these systems are very often made up of sub-systems which have achieved an isolation and a constant adjustment within themselves . Thus when a change takes place in one institution , a series of compensatory changes takes place in other institutions tangent to it , but nevertheless these changes do not proceed with equal velocity throughout the entire system of tangent institutions . Those institutions in a very stable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would take a large change in the interaction rate of a tangent relation to disturb its equilibrium . This kind of situation is easily understood when you watch the progress of a strike in a factory . Under ordinary conditions , certain departments in the factory are in a stable state and the tangent systems of the individuals making them up are equally stable . Thus , owing to the organization of work and the sets of relations in the factory , wide changes in interaction which may arise in certain parts of the production system may involve no changes in staff departments , and thus some of the workmen can remain in their customary relations within the institution . In describing changes that take place in institutions , therefore , it is convenient to deal with those parts of a system which undergo change and to disregard the parts which remain constant . In much of what follows we shall omit from consideration the presence of systems in which interaction rates remain constant , or relatively so , and concentrate our attention upon the systems and sub-systems where changes take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technological changes in economic institutions bring about profound changes in those institutions , as well as in political and family systems , we may fail to mention that , as far as we can tell , the religious system remains constant . This omission will more often be due to the fact that our sources omit the relevant information than because we desire to simplify the presentation , for it generally happens that we have to make the assumption that a system remains constant from the fact that the author failed to mention it in his account of changes . Changes in the Adjustments of Societies . Our principal concern in studying the interrelationships of institutions within societies is , therefore , to see what changes take place as a consequence of disturbances in one or more institutions . These changes may be divided for convenience into two types : ( I ) Recurrent and ( 2 ) Non-recurrent . We have already considered some of these briefly in discussing the crises which disturb individuals and groups , but here it will be more convenient to outline them systematically and study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RECURRENT CHANGES : PERIODIC Recurrent changes may be subdivided into those that are periodic , or cyclical , and those that recur without ' any regular rhythm . With the first type , the periodic changes , we are already somewhat familiar . In the beginning of this section , in discussing the daily and weekly changes of the interactions of an individual in different institutions , we saw how these interactions were controlled by a daily rhythm . In every society these rhythms differ , and marked variations in the equilibrium of individuals arise from this fact . Let us take two examples of this : one from a simple society in which all interaction takes place within the family , and one from a more complex society . The Andamanese . In the Andaman Islands , where people live by a simple food-gathering technology , the different family groups within a camp break up in the morning , the men going off hunting or fishing , and the women and children staying about the camp and gathering food . By midday the camp may be quite deserted , save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children . In the afternoon , the women return from the forest with the food they have collected and the men come in with game . If a pig has been brought in , the men cook it in the public cooking place , cut it up and distribute it to members of the community , and the women then proceed to cook the family meal . Each family eats by itself . After the meal is over , the men may spend an hour or two dancing to the accompaniment of a song sung by a man with a chorus of women . They may then eat another meal when the dance is over , and after this lie down in their huts to sleep . The rhythm of this interaction is quite different from , let us say , that of the farm family in the United States , where there may be a regular routine of three meals a day with all the family present . Just as there are daily variations in interaction in every system of relations , so are weekly changes equally common . Religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week . The Christian goes to church on Sunday , the Mohammedan to the mosque on Friday , and the Jew to the synagogue on Saturday . In the chapter on Economic Institutions , we saw how the markets in the Rif were held once a week in a particular district , and here as well as elsewhere the religious and economic institutions are dovetailed so that on the day of religious activity , economic institutions are not in interaction . It should be pointed out , however , that such precise periodicities are not generally found in the very simple societies , like that of the Andamanese , the Australians , etc . In societies where calendars have been developed , gener448 THE DEVELOPMENT OF INSTITUTIONS ally in association with the phases of the moon or divisions of the solar year , festivals and other regular activities occur with considerable accuracy . But among the simpler groups , particularly the food-gatherers , the rhythmic variation is seasonal , and the changes in the seasons are generally based upon observation of the flowering of plants , the appearance and disappearance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has seasonal variations , and the Andamanese , being about the simplest society that exists , presents us with a very clearly marked seasonal variation in interaction . The Andamanese , as we have seen , live in a monsoon climate . During the rainy season they live in their main encampment and are chiefly concerned with hunting . At the end of the rainy season , there comes a brief period of unsettled weather , during which vegetable foods begin to be more available , and the natives also gather insect larvae and feast on them . This period is followed by a cool season , when fruits and roots are plentiful , and little hunting is done . Some of the forest-dwellers leave their camp and go off and pay visits to their friends in other groups ; those who remain live in temporary camps . Instead of the men going off by themselves , they help the women to look for fruits . When the hot season begins , honey becomes plentiful and everyone is busy collecting it . Pig-hunting is abandoned because the meat is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the natives return to their headquarters camp to start the hunting season . Thus these seasonal shifts , which are determined by changes in .. the technology of a people in adaptation to the environment , produce changes in the personnel of the individuals in the camp and in the frequency of their interaction . As we have seen in Part II , in reference to technology , these seasonal changes are characteristic of every society and involve systematic changes in interaction . The amount of change in interaction during different seasons depends on the balance between the amount of seasonal change in a given environment and the degree of perfection of the techniques , such as housing , transport , clothing , etc. , by which they counteract it . We shall see a more elaborate example of this in the case of the Omaha . The Omaha . The Omaha , with whom the reader should by now be familiar , were a buffalo-hunting people who also practiced some agriculture . In the spring they used to plant corn , squash , and beans in gardens along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked together . They kept up their agricultural activities by weeding and hoeing these gardens until the tribe started out on its annual buffalo hunt in July . When this happened , as we have seen , the hierarchical institution , headed by the hereditary Leader of the Buffalo Hunt , started to operate as a result of the changes in techniques associated with the movement of the tribe // away from its permanent winter village into a summer existence in tipis . Just before the hunt began , the Keeper of the Sacred White Buffalo Hide called a council of the Seven Peace Chiefs , and the selection of the hereditary Leader of the Buffalo Hunt was confirmed . At this council , the general direction of the hunt was decided , and from this time on the hereditary Leader was in charge . During the march , each night the women set up the tipis , and the tribe camped in a circle called " Huthuga , " with its entrance facing to the east , and each gens ( patrilineal clan ) , sub-gens , and sub-division pitched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If a man stood in the entrance to the circle and looked toward the west , the five gentes of the earth moiety were on his left hand and the five gentes of the sky moiety on his right . Thus during the entire time of the hunt , every family had its position fixed in relation not only to the other members of its gens but also to its neighbors . For example , the members of the Washabeton , a sub-gens of the Honga gens , had on their left hand the Xuka division of the Wacabe Itazhi , a sub-gens of the Thatada . And when the members of the Honga gens sang its rituals , members of the Xuka division acted as hereditary prompters . When the tribe reached the buffalo country , the Chiefs and the Leader of the Buffalo Hunt and the Keeper of the White Buffalo Hide met in council and appointed the soldiers . Then they held the buffalo hunt in four big tribal surrounds . Once these were over and they had all the meat they needed , hunting activities stopped and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We shall consider this ceremony in some detail in Chapter zI from the standpoint of the Rites of Intensification . Here we wish merely to say that in it two systems of relations were active : ( I ) those between the men who had previously won war honors , and ( 2 ) those between the Appointive Chiefs ( Nikagahi Xude ) , who , together with the Seven Peace Chiefs ( Nikagahi Shabe ) , were summoned to take part in the ceremony , and who had been relieved of leadership during the actual hunting . In one part of the ceremony , for example , the Chiefs originated action to all of the warriors ( householders ) by sending a message to each through the tribal herald , and they were supposed to respond by sending one of their children with a special piece of buffalo meat to the Keeper of the Pole . At the end of the ceremony , the young men of the tribe made a mock charge on the camp , and the warriors who had won honors in defensive warfare acted out their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the I-ledewachi , involved all the members of the tribe , who rc450 THE DEVELOPMENT OF INSTITUTIONS sponded in unison , organized in their gentes , in songs and dances to the origins of action of their religious leaders . At the end of the ceremony , in which everyone , young and old , took part , the members of the tribe were free to break up and either return to the village or continue to hunt in small groups . In the sequence of ceremonies just described , the analysis of which will concern us later on , the political , religious and family organizations were all in relationship , but after the annual breakup of the tribe and its return to winter quarters , the activities associated with these institutions became much less frequent , and there was a corresponding rise in the interaction with the tribal associations , the organization with which we dealt in the last chapter . Most of the associations met about once a month throughout the winter , with the exception of the Shell Society , whose regular meetings were in May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the annual buffalo hunt . At these meetings the members were concerned with symbolic activities associated with the principal food animals of the Omaha : the black bear , buffalo , elk and deer , all of which they hunted during the spring , summer and fall . The Omaha , therefore , represent a group in which there is a marked alternation between a period in which the political , religious and extended family organizations are active and a period when small family groups and associations are principally active . A similar alternation is also to be found in the majority of white communities in the United States , where meetings of associations are largely held in the fall , winter and spring . Among most people who have associations these seasonal variations , therefore , which are based upon the techniques by which the people adapt themselves to their environments , provide the mechanism for an orderly shift from interaction in one institution to interaction in another . They . may , therefore , be regarded as an example of similar adjustments in other societies , where the necessity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a periodic readjustment of their participation in the ' institutions which exist in their society . These interactions , then , take place without too much variation for the tolerance of the system , which changes with seasonal regularity from one level of equilibrium to another . Beside these daily , weekly , and seasonal changes in frequency of events illustrated above , in many societies where calendric systems have been developed , other cycles of activity occur at longer intervals . The Olympic games were held once in four years ; the Gallas change their political officers once in eight . The Aztecs held great ceremonial festivals every twenty years , the Mayas every fifty-two , and in our own New England communi-
