Mild , moon-faced William Goetz , president and production stay of Hollywood 's young &; healthy International Pictures Corp. , was rich with property . Time was when Goetz had had to rent lot space , pick up stars , writers and directors on the run , and share his profits with the industry 's entrenched distributors . Now fast-failing Universal Pictures , the sixth largest company in town , had dropped 230 acres of lot space and 31 key domestic distribution offices into International 's lap . Included in Universal 's assets was the first crack at the more than 1,000 theaters owned by British Film Magnate J. Arthur Rank . Mr. Goetz could hardly contain himself . <P> International 's good fortune began when the Government ordered the industry to give up the monopolistic practice of block booking ( TIME , June 24 ) . Shorn of the chance to peddle its potboiling B pictures , Universal was left with only two A-makers , Deanna Durbin and Abbott &; Costello , to service its outlets . <P> The only answer was to merge with an up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) a new corporation , Universal-International , formed last week with Goetz as president and Hollywood lawyer Leo Spitz as board chairman ( U-I will be to Universal what M-G-M is to Loew 's ) ; 2 ) the degeneration of once formidable Universal into a distributing company ; 3 ) a hike of six points in Universal stock . <P> Under the new setup , U-I will become the first major company formed to produce A pictures exclusively . Many Universal production heads will roll . Such Universal executives as J. Cheever Cowdin and Nate Blumberg will retain their rank in what remains of their old company . Their job will be to distribute each year 25 U-I pictures , twelve hard-to-sell Rank pictures , and five of Charlie Einfeld 's Enterprise Pictures Inc. , U-I 's foundling affiliate . <P> They will have to work at least as hard as their new boss . But with a $60 million budget and all that property to play with , Bill Goetz will be hard for even his father-in-law , MGM 's mighty Louis B. Mayer , to match .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
