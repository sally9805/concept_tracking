How do you address an American businessman ? Last week British exporters and importers got some sound advice on this subject from Wilfred Hansford Gallienne , back home in Birmingham from his post as consul general in Chicago . In writing to clients in the States , Gallienne advised " preciseness , warmth and moderation . " Said he : <P> " A great many American businessmen believe and fear that Britain has become entirely Red . Americans are not inclined to believe very much of what is said by statesmen , politicians and diplomats , but they are always ready to believe what a businessman says . If he writes from England , what he says is accepted as straight from the horse 's mouth and is believed implicitly . " <P> He urged his countrymen to answer every letter from U.S. businessmen , but he made one plea : " Do n't make any comments on American politics . Never praise Mr. Roosevelt . Although he is dead , those who hated him then hate him now and those who liked him resent praise from Britain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
