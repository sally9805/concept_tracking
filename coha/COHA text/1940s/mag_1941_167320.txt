With a sob in his voice and a look at the record , Governor W. Lee O'Daniel last week jumped into the Texas Senatorial campaign . There are now 21 candidates . O'Daniel 's joining them made the State 's special election this month , to find a successor to the late , great Prohibitionist Morris Sheppard , the biggest U.S. political show since the Presidential campaign last fall . <P> The political situation in Texas was confused enough before the Governor jumped in . Three weeks after the campaign 's start ( TIME , May 5 ) , most observers were ready to tear up their dope sheets . Martin Dies , who eats two Communists for breakfast every morning , was running a surprisingly colorless campaign . Lyndon Johnson , 32 , the New Deal 's candidate , suffered the awful fate of Wendell Willkie-his voice gave out just as he began a whirlwind speaking tour . If anybody looked strong it was Gerald Mann , 34 , Attorney General , who still carries about his eyes a mass of scar tissue from the days when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first great All-American and forward passer from the Southwest . <P> Gerald Mann does n't cuss , does n't drink , is slight , quick , deep-eyed , and keeps his weight down to his quarterback 's 150 lb . <P> Nobody expected the lesser candidates to win . But nobody knew how many votes they would take from the big four of O'Daniel , Mann , Johnson , Dies , or from whom they would take most . Some of the minor meteors : <P> Evangelist Sam Morris , the " Voice of Temperance , " radio prohibitionist . His strongest card : a letter written by Morris Sheppard before his death , praising Sam Morris ' fight against the Demon Rum . <P> Gland Specialist John Brinkley , barely defeated ( twice ) for the Governorship of Kansas , once potent operator of a radio station over the Mexican border . Said William Allen White : " He will appeal to the hillbilly mind as it has never been lured before . . . . He is irresistible to the moron mind , and Texas has plenty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may win . <P> Mineral Water Salesman Hal Collins , with a radio following , a string band , a dialect entertainer , introduced a new trick at campaign rallies : he gave away a mattress to the largest family present . But when O'Daniel entered the race , Hal Collins dropped out , saying , " Anybody with an ounce of brains would know it 's the only thing to do . " <P> Nobody paid much mind to A. B. ( " Cyclone " ) Davis of Dallas , who runs for everything ; to a politically unknown ex-West Pointer who buys radio time to demand an immediate declaration of war against Germany , Japan , Italy ; to old Basil Muse Hatfield , " Commodore of Inland Rivers , " who is campaigning for a five-ocean navy . <P> Radio spellbinders and Gerald Mann may cut into O'Daniel 's support , but the tone of his announcement showed they faced a mighty task : " I shall take along with me the Ten Commandments , the Golden Rule , an inbred and inerasable common touch with the common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke of his " old , old friend the President , " urged more and bigger pensions and fewer strikes . He ended with a poem : <P> No knightly crown will I ever crave ' Cept a conscience clear and an honest grave . . . .
