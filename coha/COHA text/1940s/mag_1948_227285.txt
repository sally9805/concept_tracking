On the edge of a Christmas buying season which had been expected to break all records , U.S. retailers last week broke forth in a rash of unseasonal clearance sales . Reason : for three weeks in a row , their dollar volume had fallen below the level of a year ago . To step it up , they marked down prices and bulged the newspapers with ads of eye-popping bargains . <P> Retailers ' worries were the customers ' delights . In Cleveland , a $25 Thanksgiving dinner for eight was thrown in with every refrigerator bought from Sears , Roebuck &; Co . In Chicago , washing machines were offered at $50 below list price . Manhattan stores trimmed prices of women 's dresses , furs , shoes , gloves , millinery , hosiery from 25% to 50% . Even the carriage trade 's Hattie Carnegie , who ordinarily does not stress prices , advertised a clearance sale of hats at $10 &; up . <P> King Customer . What had caused the drop in retail sales ? Most retailers blamed the unseasonal warm weather . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stores , Inc. , thought the trouble was something more than that . His chain had just increased its profit 27%-on a sales increase of only 13.6%-to a record of $12 million for the year ended in October . But , like others , Federated felt the November slump . Said Lazarus : " The market has become a buyers ' market . The day of honest-to-goodness merchandising is back . " <P> In some cases ( notably soft goods and furs ) retail prices had fallen close to wholesale levels . The reason was that the cost of materials had fallen but manufacturers and wholesalers , loaded with goods made at higher costs , were still trying to get the old prices . Retailers wanted new stock at prices reflecting present costs . To move old stock they were trimming price tags to that level . Nevertheless , Lazarus felt that price cuts and better quality goods would boost December sales enough to take up November 's slack , and more . <P> The customer was approaching kingship again in more fields than retail trade . His unwillingness to buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ %-more than seasonal-in October . And many high-priced houses had had " for sale " signs on them for months . Some housing materials might soon be cheaper . The lumber industry , whose record production had begun to back up in the yards , had already trimmed wholesale prices ; yet production was still ahead of sales . <P> King Competition . In New York City , where home-delivered milk had soared to 25 a quart , consumption had dropped and worried dairy farmers asked the Department of Agriculture to cut farm milk prices . The farm equipment industry , which will do a record $2 billion business this year , was finally catching up with its huge backlog of orders . Small tractors , once scarcer than autos , could now be bought off dealers ' floors . <P> All this made businessmen cautious , though few were talking recession . The U.S. was turning out more goods than ever before ; in the third quarter , the gross national product hit a new high annual rate of $256 billion , up $5.5 billion from the previous quarter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
