Last week in Edinburgh , where , stern John Knox once thundered against the impiety of 16th Century non-Presbyterian queens , - some Scots were up to their favorite game of censuring English morals . Their targets : Princess Elizabeth and husband Philip . <P> The little Free Church of Scotland , strict Highland offshoot of the Church of Scotland , passed a resolution expressing " grief and concern " that the royal couple , in their visit to Paris ( TIME , May 24 ) had indulged in " racing , theater and nightclub dancing on the Lord 's Day . " <P> Said the " Wee Free 's " resolution : " . . . We believe this is ... repugnant to the most sacred convictions of the great mass of His Majesty 's most loyal subjects , and sets a most regrettable example before the youth of the nation , who look to Their Royal Highnesses for guidance and inspiration . . . " <P> The Church of Scotland itself , also meeting in Knox 's city last week , said nothing . And below the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " As guests of the French people , the Princess and her husband shared in a typical continental Sunday . There would appear to be nothing wrong in that . " Another who found the Scottish rebuke overly Knoxious was the Venerable J.H.L. Morrell , Archdeacon of Lewes . The royal couple , said Morrell , had " formally done their duty to God by attending divine services on God 's day , " then had merely " enjoyed themselves naturally and normally as people in France normally behave . " But nobody knew better than royalty that the stern voice of Scottish conscience could not be entirely ignored . It was not likely to happen again . <P> - In 1561 , when Mary Stuart , Queen of the Scots , brought her court to Edinburgh , Knox cried : " The preachers were wondrous vehement in reprehension of all manner of vice , which then began to abound ; and especially avarice , oppression of the poor , excess , riotous cheer , banqueting , immoderate dancing , and whoredom that thereof ensues . " Knox titled one famous pamphlet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Regiment of Women . "
