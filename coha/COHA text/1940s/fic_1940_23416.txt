PANTALOON IN BLACK A STORY BY WILLIAM FAULKNER H E STOOD in the worn , faded , clean overalls which Mannie herself had washed only a week ago , and heard the first clod strike the pine box . Soon he had one of the shovels himself , which in his hands ( he was better than six feet and weighed better than two hundred pounds ) resembled the toy shovel a child plays with at the shore , its half cubic foot of flung dirt no more than the light gout of sand the child 's shovel would have flung . Another member of his sawmill gang touched his arm and said , " Lemme have hit , Rider . " He did n't even falter . He released one hand in midstroke and flung it backward , striking the other across the chest , jolting him back a step , and restored the hand to the moving shovel , flinging the dirt with that effortless fury so that the mound seemed to be rising of its own volition , not built up from above but thrusting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last the grave , save for its rawness , resembled any other , marked off without order about the barren plot by shards of pottery and broken bottles and old brick and other objects insignificant to sight but actually of a profound meaning and fatal to touch , which no white man could have read . Then he straightened up and with one hand flung the shovel quivering upright in the mound like a javelin and turned and began to walk away , walking on even when an old woman came out of the meagerclump of his kin and friends and a few old people who had known him and his dead wife both since they were born , and grasped his forearm . She was his aunt . She had raised him . He could not remember his parents at all . " Whar you gwine ? " she said . " Ah 'm goan home , " he said . " You do n't wants ter go back dar by yoself . You needs to eat . You come on home and eat . " " Ah 'm goan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hand , his forearm like iron , as if the weight on it were no more than that of a fly , the other members of the mill gang whose head he was giving way quietly to let him pass . But before he reached the fence one of them overtook him ; he did not need to be told it was his aunt 's messenger . " Wait , Rider , " the other said . " We gots a jug in de bushes ? " Then the other said what he had not intended to say , what he had never conceived of saying in circumstances Iike these , even though everybody knew it  --  the dead who either will not or can not quit the earth yet , although the flesh they once lived in has been returned to it  --  let the preachers tell and reiterate and affirm how they left it not only without regret but with joy , mounting toward glory : " You do n't wants ter go back dar . She be wawkin yit . " He did n't pause , glancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inner corners in his high , slightly back-tilted head . " Lemme lone , Acey , " he said . " Doan mess wid me now , " and went on , stepping over the three-strand wire fence without even breaking his stride , and crossed the road and entered the woods . It was middle dusk when he emerged from them and crossed the last field , stepping over that fence too in one stride , into the lane . It was empty at this hour of Sunday evening  --  no family in wagon , no rider , no walkers churchward to speak to him and carefully refrain from looking after him when he had passed  --  the pale , powder-light , powder-dry dust of August from which the long week 's marks of hoof and wheel had been blotted by the strolling and unhurried Sunday shoes , with somewhere beneath them , vanished but not gone , fixed and held in the annealing dust , the narrow , splay-toed prints of his wife 's bare feet where on Saturday afternoons she would walk to the commissary to buy their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself , his own prints , setting the period now as he strode on , moving almost as fast as a smaller man could have trotted , his body breasting the air her body had vacated , his eyes touching the objects  --  post and tree and field and house and hill  --  her eyes had lost . The house was the last one in the lane , not his but rented from the local white landowner . But the rent was paid promptly in advance , and even in just six months he had refloored the porch and rebuilt and reroofed the kitchen , doing the work himself on Saturday afternoon and Sunday with his wife helping him , and bought the stove . Because he made good money : sawmilling ever since he began to get his growth at fifteen and sixteen and now , at twenty-four , head of the timber gang itself because the gang he headed moved a third again as much timber between sunup and sundown as any other , handling himself at times out of the vanity of his own strength logs which ordinarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without work even in the old dayswhen he had not actually needed the money , when a lot of what he wanted , needed perhaps , did n't cost money the women bright and dark and for all purposes nameless he did n't need to buy , and it did n't matter to him what he wore , and there was always food for him at any hour of day or night in the house of his aunt who did n't even want to take the two dollars he gave her each Saturday . So there had been only the Saturday and Sunday dice and whiskey that had to be paid for until that day six months ago when he saw Mannie , whom he had known all his life , for the first time and said to himself : " Ah 'm the wid all dat , " and they married and he rented the cabin from Carothers Edmunds and built a fire on the hearth on their wedding night as the tale told how Uncle Lucas Beauchamp , Edmonds ' oldest tenant , had done on his forty-five years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would rise and dress and eat his breakfast by lamplight to walk the four miles to the mill by sunup , and exactly one hour after sundown he would enter the house again , five days a week , until Saturday . Then the first hour would not have passed noon when he would mount the steps and knock , not on post or door frame but on the underside of the gallery roof itself , and enter and ring the bright cascade of silver dollars on to the scrubbed table in the kitchen where his dinner simmered on the stove and the galvanized tub of hot water and the baking-powder can of soft soap and the towel made of scalded flour sacks sewn together and his clean overalls and shirt waited , and Mannie would gather up the money and walk the half-mile to the commissary and buy their next week 's supplies and bank the rest of the money in Edmonds ' safe and return and they would eat once again without haste or hurry after five days  --  the sidemeat , the greens , the cornbread , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baked every Saturday now that she had a stove to bake in . But when he put his hand on the gate it seemed to him suddenly that there was nothing beyond it . The house had never been his anyway , but now even the new planks and sills and shingles , the hearth and stove and bed were all a part of the memory of somebody else , so that he stopped in the half-open gate and said aloud , as though he had gone to sleep in one place and then waked suddenly to find himself in another : " Whut 's Ah doin hyar ? " before he went on . Then he saw the dog . He had forgotten it . He remembered neither seeing nor hearing it since it began to howl just before dawn yesterday  --  a big dog , a hound with a strain of mastiff from somewhere ( he had told Mannic a month after they married : " Ah needs a big dawg . You 's de onliest least thing whut ever kep up wid me one day , leff alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gallery and approaching , not running but seeming rather to drift across the dusk until it stood lightly against his leg , its head raised until the tips of his fingers just touched it , facing the house and making no sound ; whereupon , as if the animal controlled it , had lain guardian before it during his absence and only this instant relinquished , the shell of planks and shingles facing him solidified , filled , and for the moment he believed that he could not possibly enter it . " But Ah needs to eat , " he said . " Us bofe needs to eat , " he said , moving on though the dog did not follow until he turned and cursed it . " Come on hyar ! " he said . " Whut you skeered of She lacked you too , same as me . " They mounted the steps and crossed the porch and entered the house  --  the dusk-filled single room where all those six months were now crammed and crowded into one instant of time until there was no space left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearth where the fire which was to have lasted to the end of them , in front of which in the days before he was able to buy the stove he would enter after his four-mile walk from the mill and find her , the shape ofher narrow back and haunches squatting , one narrow spread hand shielding her face from the blaze over which the other hand held the skillet , had already fallen to a dry , light soilure of dead ashes when the sun rose yesterday  --  and himself standing there while the last of light died about the strong and indomitable beating of his heart and the deep steady arch and collapse of his chest which walking fast over the rough going of woods and fields had not increased and standing still in the quiet and fading room had not slowed down . Then the dog left him . The light pressure went off his flank ; he heard the click and hiss of its claws on the wooden floor as it surged away , and he thought at first that it was fleeing . But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see it now and the upfling of its head as the howl began ; and then he saw her too . She was standing in the kitchen door , looking at him . He did n't move . He did n't breathe or speak until he knew his voice would be all right , his face fixed too not to alarm her . " Mannie , " he said . " Hit 's awright . Ah ai n't afraid . " Then he took a step toward her , slow , not even raising his hand yet , and stopped . Then he took another step . But this time as soon as he moved she began to fade . He stopped at once , not breathing again , motionless , willing his eyes to see that she had stopped too . But she had not stopped . She was fading , going . " Wait , " he said , talking as sweet as he had ever heard his voice speak to a woman : " Den lemme go wid you , honey . " But she was going . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between them the insuperable barrier of that very strength which could handle alone a log which would have taken any two other men to handle , of the blood and bones and flesh too strong , invincible for life , having learned , at least once with his own eyes , how tough , even in sudden and violent death , not a young man 's bones and flesh perhaps but the will of that bone and flesh to remain alive , actually was . Then she was gone . He walked through the door where she had been standing and went to the stove . He did not light the lamp . He needed no light . He had set the stove up himself and built the shelves for the dishes , from among which he took two plates by feel and from the pot , sitting cold on the cold stove , he ladled on to the plates the food which his aunt had brought yesterday and of which he had eaten yesterday , though now he did not remember when he had eaten it nor what it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneath the single small fading window and drew two chairs up and sat down , waiting again until he knew his voice would be what he wanted it to he . " Come on hyar now , " he said roughly . " Come on hyar and eat yo supper . Ah ai n't gonter have no . . . " and ceased , looking down at his plate , breathing the strong , deep pants , his chest arching and collapsing until he stopped it presently and held himself motionless for perhaps a half minute , and raised a spoonful of the cold and glutinous pease to his mouth . The congealed and lifeless mass seemed to bounce on contact with his lips . Not even warmed from mouth-heat , pease and spoon spattered and rang upon the plate ; his chair crashed backward and he was standing , feeling the muscles of his jaw beginning to drag his mouth open , tugging upward the top half of his head . But he stopped that too before it became sound , holding himself again while he rapidly scraped the food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and left the kitchen , crossed the other room and the gallery and set the plate on the bottom step and went on toward the gate . The dog was not there but it overtook him within the first half-mile . There was a moon then , their two shadows flitting broken and intermittent among the trees or slanted long and intact across the slope of pasture or old abandoned fields upon the hills , the man moving al-most as fast as a horse could have covered that ground , altering his course each time a lighted window came in sight , the dog trotting at heel while their shadows shortened to the moon 's curve until at last they trod them and the last far lamp had vanished and the shadows began to lengthen on the other hand , keeping to heel even when a rabbit burst from almost beneath the man 's foot , then lying in the gray of dawn beside the man 's prone body , beside the labored heave and collapse of the chest , the loud harsh snoring which sounded , not like groans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prolonged single combat . When he reached the mill there was nobody there but the fireman , an older man just turning from the woodpile , watching quietly as he crossed the clearing , striding as if he were going to walk not only through the boiler shed but through ( or over ) the boiler too , the overalls which had been clean yesterday now draggled and soiled and drenched to the knees with dew , the cloth cap flung on to the side of his head , hanging peak downward over his car as he always wore it , the whites of his eyes rimmed with red and with something urgent and strained about them . " Whar yo bucket ? " he said . But before the fireman could answer he had stepped past him and lifted the polished lard pail down from a nail in a post . " Ah just wants a biscuit , " he said . " Eat hit all , " the fireman said . " Ah 'll eat outen de yuthers ' buckets at dinner . Den you gawn home and go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ah ai n't come hyar to look , " he said , sitting on the ground , his back against the post , the open pail between his knees , cramming the food into his mouth with his hands , wolfing it pease again , also gelid and cold , a fragment of yesterday 's Sunday fried chicken , a few rough chunks of this morning 's fried sidemeat , a biscuit the size of a child 's cap  --  indiscriminate , tasteless . The rest of the crew was gathering now , the voices and sounds of movement outside the boiler shed . Presently the white foreman rode into the clearing on a horse . Rider did not look up ; setting the empty pail aside , rising , looking at no one , he went to the branch and lay on his stomach and lowered his face to the water , drawing the water into himself with the same deep , strong , troubled inhalations that he had snored with , or as when he had stood in the empty house at dusk yesterday , trying to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulsed with the rapid beating of the exhaust and the whine and clang of the saw , the trucks rolling one by one up to the skidway as he mounted them in turn , to stand balanced on the load he freed , knocking the chocks out and casting loose the shackle chains and with his cant hook squaring the sticks of cypress and gum and oak one by one to the incline and holding them until the next two men of his gang were ready to receive and guide them , until the discharge of each truck became one long rumbling roar punctuated by grunting shouts and , as the morning grew and the sweat came , chanted phrases of song tossed back and forth . He did not sing with them . He rarely ever did , and this morning might have been no different from any other  --  himself man-height again above the heads which carefully refrained from looking at him , stripped to the waist now , the shirt removed and the overalls knotted about his hips by the suspender straps , his upper body bare except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and clinging somehow over his right ear , the mounting sun sweat-glinted steel-blue on the midnight-colored bunch and slip of muscles , until the whistle blew for noon and he said to the two men at the head of the skidway ; " Look out . Git out de way , " and rode the log down the incline , balanced erect in short rapid backward-running steps above the headlong thunder . His aunt 's husband was waiting for him , an old man as tall as he was , but lean , almost frail , carrying a tin pail in one hand and a covered plate in theother . They too sat in the shade beside the branch a short distance from where the others were opening their dinner pails . The bucket contained a fruit jar of buttermilk packed in a clean damp towsack . The covered dish was a peach pie , still warm . " She baked hit fer you dis mawnin , " the uncle said . " She say fer you to come home . " He did n't answer , bent forward a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in both hands , wolfing at it , the syrupy filling smearing and trickling down his chin , blinking rapidly as he chewed , the whites of his eyes covered a little more by the creeping red . " Ah went to yo house last night , but you want dar . She sont me . She wants you ter come on home . She kept de lamp burnin ' all last night fer you . " awright , " he said . " You ai n't awright . De Lawd guy , and He tuck away . Put yo faith and trust in Him . And she kin help you . " " Whut faith and trust ? " he said . " Whut I  --  lannie ever done ter Him ? Whut He wanter come messin ' wid me and ? " " Hush ! " the old man said . " Hush ! " Then the trucks were roiling again . Then he could stop needing to invent to himself reasons for his breathing , until after a while he began to believe he had forgot about breathing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steady thunder of the rolling logs ; whereupon as soon as he found himself believing he had forgotten it , he knew that he had not , so that , instead of tipping the final log on to the skid way , he stood up and cast his cant hook away as if it were a burnt match , and in the dying reverberation of the last log 's rumbling descent he vaulted down between the two slanted tracks of the skid , facing the log which still lay on the truck . He had done it before  --  taken a log from the truck in his hands , balanced , and turned with it and tossed it on to the skidway , but never with a stick of this size . So that in a complete cessation of all sound save the pulse of the exhaust and the light free-running whine of the disengaged saw , since every eye there , even that of the white forcman , was upon him , he nudged the log to the edge of the truck-frame and squatted and set his palms against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement at all . It was as if the unrational and inanimate wood had invested , mesmerized the man with some of its own primal inertia . Then a voice said quietly : " He got hit . Hit 's off de truck , " and they saw the crack and gap of air , watching the infinitesimal straightening of the braced legs until the knees locked , the movement mounting infinitesimally through the belly 's insuck , the arch of the chest , the neck cords , lifting the Iip from the white clench of teeth in passing , drawing the whole head backward and only the bloodshot fixity of the eyes impervious to it , moving on up the arms and the straightening elbows until the balanced log was higher than his head . " Only he ai n't gonter turn wid dat un , " the same voice said . " And when he try to put hit back on de truck , hit gonter kill him . " But none of them moved . Then  --  there was no gathering of supreme effort  --  the log seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volition , spinning , crashing , and thundering down the incline . He turned and stepped over the slanting track in one stride and walked through them as they gave way and went on across the clearing toward the woods even though the foreman called after him : " Rider ! " and again : " You , Rider ! " At sundown he and the dog were in the river swamp four miles away  --  another clearing , itself not much larger than a room , a hut , a hovel partly of planks and partly of canvas , an unshaven white man standing in the door beside which a shotgun leaned , watching him as he approached , his hand extended with four silver dollars on the palm . " Ah wants a jug , " he said . " A jug ? " the white man said . " You mean a pint . This is Monday . Ai n't you all running this week ? " " Ah laid off , " he said . " Whar 's my jug ? " waiting , looking at nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , slightly back-tilted head , then turning , the jug hanging from his crooked middle finger against his leg , at which moment the white man looked suddenly and sharply at his eyes as though seeing them for the first time  --  the eyes which had been strained and urgent this morning and which now seemed to be without vision too and in which no white showed at all  --  and said : " Here . Gim me that jug . You do n't need no gallon . I 'm going to give you that pint , give it to you . Then you get out of here and stay out . Do n't come back until ? " Then the white man reached and grasped the jug , whereupon the other swung it behind him , sweeping his other arm up and out so that it struck the white man across the chest . " Look out , white folks , " he said . " Hit 's mine . Ah done paid you . " The white man cursed him . " No you ai n't . Here 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Hit 's mine , " he said , his voice quiet , gentle even , his face quiet save for the rapid blinking of the red eyes . " Ah done paid for hit . " Turning his back on the man and the gun both , he recrossed the clearing to where the dog waited beside the path to come to heel again . They moved rapidly on between the close walls of impenetrable cane-stalks which gave a sort of blondness to the twilight and possessed something of that oppression , that lack of room to breathe in , which the walls of his house had had . But this time , instead of fleeing it , he stopped and raised the jug and drew the cob stopper from the fierce dusk-reek of uncured alcohol and drank , gulping the liquid solid and cold as ice water , without either taste or heat until he lowered the jug and the air got in . " Hah , " he said . " Dat 's right . Try me . Try me , big boy . Ah gots some-thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once free of the bottom 's unbreathing blackness , there was the moon again . His long shadow and that of the lifted jug slanted away as he drank and then held the jug poised , gulping the silver air into his throat until he could breathe again , speaking to the jug : " Come on now . You always claims you 's a better man den me . Come on now . Prove hit , " and drank again , swallowing the chill liquid tamed of taste or heat either while the swallowing lasted , feeling it flow solid and cold with fire past and then enveloping the strong steady panting of his lungs until they ran suddenly free as his moving body did in the silver solid wail of air he breasted , and he was all right , his striding shadow and the trotting one of the dog traveling swift as those of two clouds along the hill , the long cast of his motionless shadow and that of the lifted jug slanting across the slope as he watched the tall frail figure of his aunt 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at de mill you wuz gone , " the old man said . " Ah knowed whar to look . Come home , son . Dat ar ca n't help you . " " Hit done awready hope me , " he said . " Ah 'm awready home . Ah 'm snakcbit now and pizen ca n't hawm me . " " Den stop and see her . Leff her look at you . Dat 's all she axes : just leff her look at you ? " But he was already moving . " Wait , " the old man cried . " Wait ! " " You ca n't keep up , " he said , speaking into the silver air , breasting aside the silver solid air which began to flow past him almost as fast as it would have flowed past a moving horse ; the faint frail voice was already lost in the night 's infinitude , his shadow and that of the dog scudding the free miles , the deep strong panting of his chest running free as air now because he was alI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more liquid was entering his mouth ; swallowing , it was no longer passing down his throat , throat andmouth filled now with a solid and unmoving column which , without any reflex of revulsion , sprang columnar and intact and still retaining the shape of his gullet , outward glinting in the moonlight , to vanish into the myriad murmur of the dewed grass . He drank again ; again his throat merely filled solidly until two icy rills ran from his mouth-corners ; again the intact column sprang silvering , glinting , while he panted the chill of air into his throat , the jug poised before his mouth while he spoke to it : " Awright . Ah 'm gwy try you again . Soon as you makes up yo mind to stay whar Ah puts you Ah 'll leff you alone . " He drank again , filling his gullet for the third time and for the third time lowered the jug one instant ahead of the bright intact repetition , panting , indrawing the cool of air until he could breathe . He stoppered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep strong panting of his chest , blinking , the long cast of his motionless and solitary shadow slanting away across the hill and beyond , across the mazy infinitude of all the night-bound earth . " Awright , " he said . " Ah just misread de sign wrong . Hit 's done done me all de help Ah needs . Ah 'm awright now . Ah doan needs no mo of hit . " He could see the lamp in the window as he crossed the pasture , passing the black-and-silver yawn of the sandy ditch where he had played as a boy with empty snuff-tins and rusted harness buckles and fragments of trace-chain and now and then an actual wheel , the garden patch where he had hoed in the spring days while his aunt stood sentry over him from the kitchen window , crossing the grassless yard in whose dust he had sprawled and crept before he learned to walk , and entered the house , the room , the light itself , his head back-tilted a little , the jug hanging from his crooked finger against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , " he said . " Not just to see you , " his aunt said . " To come home , whar we kin help you . " " Ah 'm awright , " he said . " Ah doan needs no help . " " No , " she said . She rose from the chair and came and grasped his arm as she had grasped it yesterday beside the grave ; again , as on yesterday , the forearm like iron under the hand . " No ! When Alec come back and tole me how you had wawked off de mill and de sun not half down , Ah knowed why and whar . And dat ca n't help you . " " Hit done awready hope me . Ah 'm awright now . " " Do n't lie to me , " she said . " You ai n't never lied to me . Do n't lie to me now . " Then he said it . It was his own voice , speaking quietly out of the tremendous panting of his chest which would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . But he would be gone in a moment . " Nome , " he said . " Hit ai n't done me no good . " " And hit ca n't ! Ca n't nothing help you but Him . Ax Him ! Tole Him about hit ! He wants to hyar you and help you ! " " Efn He God , Ah do n't needs to tole Him .

" But it was not his knees on the floor : it was his feet , and for a space he could hear her feet too on the planks of the hall behind him and her voice crying after him from the door : " Spout ! Spoot !

It was just after midnight when he reached the mill again . The dog was gone now . This time he could not remember when nor where . At first he seemed to remember hurling the empty MAGAZINE jug at it . But later the jug was still in his hand and it was not empty , although each time he drank now the two icy runnels streamed from his mouth-corners , sopping his shirt and overalls until he walked constantly in the fierce chill of the liquid tamed now of flavor and heat and odor too even when the swallowing stopped . " Sides , " he said , " Ah would n't th'ow nothin at him . Ah mout kick him efn he needed hit and was close enough . But Ah would n't ruint no dawg chunkin ' hit . " It was still in his hand when he entered the clearing and paused among the mute soaring of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now unimpeded shadow which he was treading again now as he had trod it last night , swaying a little , blinking about him at the stacked lumber , the skidway , the piled logs waiting for to-morrow , the boiler shed all quiet and blanched in the moon : and then it was all right . He was moving again . But he was not moving , he was drinking , the liquid cold and swift and tasteless and requiring no swallowing , so that he could not tell if it were going down inside or outside ; but it was all right . And now he was moving , the jug gone now and he did n't know the when or where of that either , crossing the clearing , entering the boiler shed and through it , crossing the junctureless trepan of time 's back-loop to the door of the tool-room , the faint glow of the lantern beyond the plank-joints , the surge and fall of a shadow between the light and the wall , the mutter of voices , the mute click and scutter of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his voice loud too : " Open hit . Hit 's me . Ah 'm snakebit and bound to die . " Then he was inside , They were the same faces  --  three members of his timber gang , three or four others of the mill crew , the white night-watchman with the heavy pistol in his hip pocket and the small heap of coins and worn banknotes on the floor before him ; himself standing over the kneeling and squatting circle , swaying a little , blinking , the deadened muscles of his face shaped into smiling while the white man stared at him . " Make room , gamblers , " he said . " Ah 'm snakebit and de pizen ca n't hawm me . " " You 're drunk , " the watchman said . " Get out of here . One of you niggers open that door and get him out of here . " " Doss awright , boss man , " he said , his voice equable , almost deferential , his face still fixed in the faint rigid smiling beneath the blinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ah just ca n't wawk straight fer dis hyar money weighin ' me down . " Now he was kneeling too , the other six dollars of his last week 's pay on the floor before him , blinking , still smiling at the face of the white man opposite , then still smiling , watching the dice pass from hand to hand around the circle as the watchman covered the bets , watching the soiled and palm-worn money in front of the white man gradually increase , watching the white man cast and win two doubled bets in succession , then lose one for twenty-five cents , the dice coming to him at last , the cupped snug clicking of them in his fist . " Shoots a dollar , " he said , and cast and watched the white man pick up the dice and flip them back to him . " Ah 'm snakebit , " he said . " Ah kin pass wid anything , " and cast , and this time one of the others flipped the dice back . " Ah lets hit lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the white man moved , catching the white man 's wrist before the hand reached the dice , the two of them squatting , facing each other above the dice and the money , his left hand grasping the white man 's right wrist , his face still fixed in the rigid and deadened smiling , his voice still almost deferential : " Ah kin pass even wid miss-outs . But dese hyar yuther boys ? " until the hand sprang open and the second pair of dice clattered on to the floor beside the other two , and the white man wrenched it free and sprang up and back and reached the hand backward toward the pocket where the pistol was . The razor hung between his shoulder blades from a loop of cotton string round his neck beneath his shirt . The same motion of the hand which brought the razor forward over his shoulder flipped the blade open and freed it from the cord , the blade opening on until the back edge of it lay across the knuckles of his fist , his thumb pressing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instant before the half-drawn pistol exploded he actually struck at the white man 's throat not with the blade but with a sweeping blow of his fist , following through in the same motion so that not even the first jet of blood touched his hand or arm . After it was over ( it did n't take long ; they found the prisoner on the following day , hanging from the bell rope in a negro schoolhouse about two miles from the sawmill , and the coroner had pronounced his verdict of death at the hands of a person or persons unknown and surrendered the body to its next of kin all within five minutes ) the sheriff 's deputy who had been officially in charge of the business was telling his wife about it . It was in the kitchen ; his wife was cooking supper , and the deputy had been up and in motion ever since the jail delivery shortly after midnight and he had covered considerable ground since , and he was spent now from lack of sleep and hurried food at hurried and curious hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little hysterical too . " Them damn niggers , " he said . " I swear to Godfrey , it 's a wonder we have as little trouble with them as we do . Because why ? Because they ai n't human . They look like a man and they walk on their hind legs like a man , and they can talk and you can understand them and you think they understand you , at least now and then . But when it comes to the normal human feelings and sentiments of human beings , they might just as well be a damn herd of wild buffaloes . Now you take this one to-day ? " " I wish you would , " his wife said harshly , a stout woman , handsome once , graying now and with a neck definitely too short , who looked not harried at all but choleric . Also she had attended a club rook party that afternoon and had won the first , the fifty-cent , prize until another member had insisted on a recount of the scores and the ultimate throwing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my kitchen , anyway . You sheriffs ! Sitting around that courthouse all day long talking . It 's no wonder two or three men can walk in and take prisoners out from under your noses . They would take your chairs and desks and window sills too if you ever got your backsides and feet off of them that long . " " It 's more of them Birdsongs than just two or three , " the deputy said . " There 's forty-two active votes in that connection . Me and Mayfield taken the poll-list and counted them up one day . But listen ? " The wife turned from the stove , carrying a dish . The deputy snatched his feet rapidly out of the way as she passed him and went on into the dining room , The deputy raised his voice a little . " His wife dies on him . All right . But does he grieve ? He 's the biggest man at the funeral . Grabs a shovel before they even got the box into the grave , I heard tell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scraper could . But that 's all right ? " His wife came back . He moved his feet again . " ? maybe that 's the way he felt about her . There ai n't any law against that , long as he never officiated at the deceasing too . But here the next day he 's the first man at the mill except the fireman , getting there before the fireman had his fire going ; five minutes earlier and lie could even helped the fireman wake Birdsong up so he could go home and go back to bed again or even cut Birdsong 's throat then and saved everybody trouble . So he comes to work , the first man on the job , when McAndrews would have give him the day off and paid him his time too , when McAndrews and everybody else expected him to take the day off , when any white man would have took the dayoff no matter how he felt about his wife , when even a little child would have had sense enough to take a holiday when he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first man there , jumping from one truck to another before the whistle quit blowing even , snatching up ten-foot cypress logs by himself and throwing them around like matches . And then , just when everybody has decided that that 's the way to take him , that that 's the way he wants to be took , he walks off the job in the middle of the afternoon without by-your-leave or thank you or good-by to McAndrews or nobody else , gets himself a whole gallon of bust-skull white-mule whiskey , comes straight back to the mill to the same crap game where Birdsong has been running crooked dice on them mill niggers for fifteen years , goes straight to the same game where he has been peacefully losing a probably steady average ninety-nine per cent of his pay ever since he got big enough to read the spots on them miss-outs , and cuts Bird-song 's throat clean to the neckbone five minutes later . " So me and Mayfield go out there . Not that we expect to do any good , as he had probably passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the simplest way to find him would be just to stay close behind them Birdsong boys . So it 's just by the merest pure chance that we go by his house ; I do n't even remember why now ; and there he is . Sitting behind the door with that razor open on one knee and his shotgun on the other ? No . Asleep . A big pot of pease set clean on the stove , and him laying in the back yard asleep in the broad sun with just his head under the edge of the porch and a dog that looked like a cross between a bear and a Polled Angus steer yelling fire and murder from the back door . And he wakes up and says , lAwright , white folks . Ah done it . Jest do n't lock me up , ' and Mayfield says , ' Mr. Birdsong 's kinfolks ai n't going to either . You 'll have plenty of fresh air when they get a hold of you , ' and he says , Ah done it . Jest do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheriff not to lock him up ; he done it all right and it 's too bad , but do n't cut him off from the fresh air . So we loaded him into the car , when here come the old woman  --  his ma or aunt or something  --  panting up the road at a dog-trot , wanting to come with us , and Mayfield trying to tell her what might happen maybe to her too if them Birdsong kin catches us before we can get him locked up , only she is coming anyway and , like Mayfield says , her being in the car might be a good thing if the Birdsongs did happen to run into us , because interference with the law ca n't be condoned even if the Birdsong connection did carry that beat for Mayfield last summer . So we brought her along too and got him to town and into the jail all right and turned him over to Ketcham and Ketcham taken him on upstairs and the old woman coming too , telling Ketcham , Ah tried to raise him right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never been in no trouble till now . He will suffer for what he done . But do n't let the white folks git him , ' and Ketcham says , You and him ought to thought of that before he started barbering white men without using no lather , ' and locked them both up in the cell because he felt like Mayfield did , that her being there might be a good influence on the Birdsong boys if anything started if he should run for sheriff when Mayfield 's term was out . So he come on back downstairs and pretty soon the chain gang come in and he thought things had settled down for a while when all of a sudden he begun to hear the yelling , not howling : yelling , though there was n't no words in it , and he grabbed his pistol and run back upstairs and into the room where the chain gang was , where he could see through the door bars into the cell where that nigger had done tore that iron cot clean out of the floor it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cell , holding the cot over his head like it was a baby 's cradle , yelling , and the old woman sitting hunched into the corner and the nigger says to her , Ah ai n't going to hurt you , ' and throws the cot against the wall and comes and grabs holt of that steel door and rips it out of the wall  --  bricks , hinges and all  --  and walks out into the big room , toting the door over his head as if it were a gauze wire window screen , saying , ' It 's awright . Ah ai n't tryin ' to git away . ' " Ketcham could have shot him right there , but like he figured , if it was n't going to be the law , then the Birdsong boys ought to have first lick at him . So Ketcham do n't shoot . Instead he jumps in behind where the chain-gang niggers were kind of backed off from that steel door , hollering , Grab him ! Throw him down ! ' except they hang back at first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones he can reach , batting at the others with the flat of the pistol until they rush him . And Ketcham says for a good minute he would grab them up as they come in and fling them clean across the room like they was rag dolls , still saying , Ah ai n't tryin ' to git out , Ah ai n't tryin ' to git out , ' until at last they pulled him down , a big mass of nigger arms and heads and legs boiling around on the floor and even then Ketcham says every now and then a nigger would come flying out and go sailing through the air across the room , spraddled like a flying squirrel and his eyes sticking out in front of him like the headlights on a car , until at last they had him down and Ketcham went in and begun peeling away niggers until he could see him laying there under the pile of niggers , laughing , with tears big as glass marbles popping out of his eyes and running across his face and down past his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor like somebody dropping bird eggs , laughing and laughing and saying , ' Hit look lack Ah just ca n't quit thinking . Look lack Ah just ca n't quit . ' And what do you think of that ? " " I think if you eat any supper in this house you 'll do it in the next five minutes , " his wife said from the dining room . " I 'm going to clear this table then and I 'm going to the picture show . "
