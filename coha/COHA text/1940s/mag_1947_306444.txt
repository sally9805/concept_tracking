APPRECIATION : PAINTING , POETRY &; PROSE ( 215 pp. ) - Leo Stein-Crown ( $2.50 ) . <P> Gertrude Stein 's elder brother Leo , now in his 70s , had delivered this book to the publishers before her death ( TIME , Aug. 5 ) . If she had lived , it might have provoked her to Steinesque limpidities in reply , for Leo 's range of appreciations does not extend to his sister 's works , nor to her enthusiasms . Their estrangement was known all over the Left Bank in the ' 20s , though one day as they passed on a Paris street , Gertrude so far forgot herself as to nod in recognition-and was then so overcome ( so the story goes ) that she wrote a poem beginning " She bowed to her brother . . . . " * <P> The Pleasure of Lookery . Brother Leo 's essays and reminiscences are valuable in their own right as an honest , amused and only slightly crotchety effort to put the whole matter of " modern art " in a clear perspective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poetry and prose ) . His confidence in his own impressions of art falls little short of the exaltation reached by Gertrude , but it is based on a lifetime of attention to art and artists and a healthy struggle to apply Dr. Johnson 's dictum : " Clear your mind of cant . " Whatever else is true of the U.S. expatriate company of which the Steins were members , they learned a good deal about the pleasures of looking at things , inciuding things on canvas . <P> Leo Stein left Paris behind 20 years ago , has since lived in &; about Florence . His typically salty reflection : " Some pious Catholic friends thought I ought to be grateful to God because I had during the German occupation and the fascist republic escaped all perils . I said to them that there had been 6,000,000 Jews murdered . Was I to be grateful to God that only 6,000,000 had been murdered and not 6,000,001 ? " <P> But Stein 's book is not about recent events nor political ones ; it is concerned mainly with the historic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American in Paris 40 years ago . His friend Bernard Berenson , the top authority on Italian art , told him to look at the Czannes at Dealer Ambroise Vollard 's in 1904 ; soon afterward he discovered Matisse and Picasso . He and Gertrude had just settled down at 27 rue de Fleurus , the address Gertrude later made famous . But according to Leo she brought no pictures home until 1911 or 1912 ; he himself built up the Stein collection . " I was the only person anywhere , so far as I know , who in those early days recognized Picasso and Matisse . " <P> The Pleasures of Cookery . Leo 's fraternal rancor against Gertrude is rarely expressed , and then only indirectly , as when he recalls that when they were children " everything Gertrude tried to cook turned out badly , but I made bread and apfelstrudel-which is very difficult . . . . " But he declares that Gertrude did n't take up Picasso until Picasso had gone wrong , i.e. , cubist . Leo 's case against cubism is cogently argued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
