For most of Hollywood , security is a will-o ' - the- wisp , but there are exceptions . Last week 47-year-old Darryl F. Zanuck , starting his 15th year as 2Oth Century-Fox 's production boss , signed up for 20 years more . The new contract will keep Zanuck at his present job for another ten years , will then claim his " exclusive service in an advisory capacity . " <P> The studio knew what it was getting . In his 14 years , Zanuck has won two Irving Thalberg Memorial Awards for high-quality production , two Oscars ( for Gentleman 's Agreement and How Green Was My Valley ) , and a reputation as Hollywood 's outstanding topical trailblazer ( The Snake Pit , Pinky ) . What Zanuck was getting : $260.000 a year ( his present salary ) for the next 10 years , then an annual $150,000 for his advice .
