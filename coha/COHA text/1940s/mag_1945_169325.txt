Secretary Stettinius last week let newsmen inspect the penthouse where he and his Big Power colleagues called the tune for the San Francisco conference . The apartment , atop the Fairmont Hotel , had been lent to Mr. Stettinius by wealthy Mrs. James Leary Flood , whose fortune originally came from the famous Comstock Lode ( Nevada gold , silver ) . The facilities included a superb view of San Francisco 's hills and bay , four bedrooms with bath , a circular library with a blue ceiling , and two love seats , upholstered in green , where Viacheslav Molotov and his consultants sat during the Big Power meetings . <P> Mrs. Flood 's guests had a fifty-fifty week . On the main business of the conference-the drafting of a charter for a world organization-the Big Three statesmen and their Big Four partner , China 's T. V. Soong , made astonishing progress . On the symbolic , overshadowing issue of Poland , the Big Three had to admit an appalling failure . <P> The contrast was instructive . When the Big Powers concerned themselves solely with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always possible . When they concerned themselves with the morals of power , agreement seemed easy in the preliminary stage of words ( i.e. , the Crimea declaration on Poland ; some of the charter amendments approved last week ) . But when they got down to cases on such issues , the deep differences between the Soviet Union and its principal allies came nakedly to the fore , and agreement was difficult if not impossible . <P> The hope of the world organization was that it might postpone at least some of the conflicts , build a structure strong enough and flexible enough to bridge the chasm . How to reconcile this objective with the new U.S. and British toughness toward Russia gave Messrs . Truman , Stettinius and Eden plenty to think about .
