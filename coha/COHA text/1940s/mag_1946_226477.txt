Contact lenses worn by actors , athletes and people who do n't want to wear spectacles have three principal drawbacks : 1 ) friction of the eye against the lens irritates the cornea , makes it difficult to wear the glasses more than eight consecutive hours ; 2 ) high cost ( up to $250 ) ; 3 ) fitting , which involves making a wax cast of the eyeball . <P> Last week in Boston , the New England Council of Optometrists looked at a new type of lens which might eliminate these difficulties . Manhattan Eyeman Dr. William Feinbloom had developed a plastic , nonbreakable lens which rocks seesaw fashion with the motion of the eye , thus forestalls cornea irritation . The new lens is available in a dozen stock models , can be fitted to any eye in a few minutes , costs $100 less than the old type .
