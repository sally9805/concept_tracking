txt WASHINGTON , Dec.14 ? Charges and counter-charges between the Army and Navy over the question of unification of the armed forces continued in lively exchanges today with Lieut . Gen. J. Walter Collins alleging that effective counter-measures against the U-boat menace in the Atlantic were delayed by lack of unified command and a Navy spokesman disputing his statement . Robert P. Patterson , Secretary of War , called a press conference to attack the recently released " Navy Plan for National Security , " which he denounced as a " diversionary effort , " and H. Struve Hensel , Assistant Secretary of the Navy , called a press conference an hour later to assail Mr. Patterson 's arguments . Among other things , Mr. Hensel , citing a purported memorandum of the War Department , said that Mr. Patterson was not presenting a correct picture when he denied that Army officers were " muzzled " from expressing their true views on the merger issue . Meanwhile , Vice Admiral DeWitt C. Ramsey , Deputy Commander in Chief of the Pacific Fleet , testifying before the Senate Military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defended the right of naval aviation to remain a powerful entity . Mr. Hensel , at his conference , indicated that the Navy 's high command might stop talking or resign when and if President Tru // man made his expected recommendation to Congress in favor of the single department . The question was whether naval officers or civilian officials of the Navy Department could express anti-merger views with propriety if Mr. Truman , who is Commander in Chief , came out in favor of the merger . Mr. Hensel said that he would not feel free to oppose it as a member of the Administration and that he did not think any officer in uniform could argue against the views of his Commander in Chief . It was at Secretary Patterson 's conference that General Collins , who was a combat commander in Europe and is now Chief of Staff of Army Ground Forces , charged that lack of single Army-Navy direction had caused " considerable delay " in combating the submarine menace . Mr. Patterson had remarked that the Joint ( Army-Navy ) Chiefs of Staff had been able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " but that , even with the war emergency , some decisions were reached " only after interminable delay and often not at all .
