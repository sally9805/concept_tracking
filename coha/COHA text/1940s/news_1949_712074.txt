txt The sweeping victory of Franklin D. Roosevelt Jr . in Tuesdays special election in the Twentieth Congressional District seemed yesterday to be likely to have four important political results . First , it started the third son of the late President on a political career that many of his supporters believe may lead eventually to higher office . Second , it paved the way for possible reorganization of Tammany Hall and a change in its present leadership . Third , it strengthened the movement to defeat Borough President Hugo E. Rogers , leader of Tammany , for renomination in the Democratic primary in September and endangered his chance of election if he should win renomination . Supporters of Mr. Roosevelt already have talked of running Robert K. Straus , head of the Democrats for Roosevelt , or Charles Horowitz , Roosevelt campaign manager , for the Democratic nomination for Borough President . Fourth , it increased the prestige of the Liberal party , leaders of which took the initiative in getting Mr. Roosevelt to become a candidate and members of which furnished a large number of workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Roosevelt had been elected by a bare plurality , as the candidate of the Liberal and Four Freedoms parties to succeed the late Representative Sol Bloom  --  that would have been sufficient to make his victory noteworthy . But it was his election by a plurality of 16,791 over Municipal Court Justice Benjamin Shalleck , his Tammany opponent , and by a clear majority ' over Mr. Shalleck and William H. , Republican , and Dr. Annette T. Rubinstein , American Labor party nominee , that made him the first new national figure of importance to emerge in this city since the election of Thomas E. Dewey as District Attorney in 1937 . Mr. Roosevelt 's victory , in which he carried every Assembly District in the Congressional District , was so sweeping that it received nation-wide recognition . Quick to congratulate the winner was President Truman , who sent the following telegram to Mr. Roosevelt , addressed to his campaign headquarters in the Gre ? - stone Hotel : " Please accept hearty congratulations on the opportunity for public service which is yours by the will of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country ? indeed the whole world  --  will watch your career in the House of Representatives in expectation of fine things . You are the inheritor of a great name and a great tradition in government . I have full faith and confidence that you will meet the responsibility which the gravity of the times imposes . " Roosevelt Reply to Truman Mr. Roosevelt telegraphed this reply : " Dear Mr. President : I am deeply grateful for your warm congratulations , confidence and encouragement . This victory is a reaffirmation of the belief of the people of the Twentieth Congressional District in honest government and in the liberal principles championed by you . I have always been and will continue to be a Democrat with both a capital ' D ' and a little ' d . ' It will be my privilege to have the opportunity of working with you for the causes to which we are both dedicated . " Mr. Roosevelt also received telegrams of congratulation from Senator J.

Whitney , president of the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen ; David Dubinsky , president of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union , and Walter Reuther , president of the United Automobile Workers . Dodges Governorship Query In an interview at the Esplanade Hotel , 305 West End Avenue , where he has his residence , Mr. Roosevelt brushed off a question whether he expected at some time in the future to be a candidate for Governor , a post held for two terms by his father . " I have no future political ambitions except to serve my district and my country faithfully , " he said . " I am not a candidate for any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Roosevelt joined in the laugh that followed . Then he said , smiling : " No , I did n't say that . " Tilting back in his chair and lighting a cigarette in a manner reminiscent of the late President , Mr. Roosevelt added : . " I do n't believe in dynasties . We have a great democracy here . Each American rises or falls on his own ability . My only ambition is to serve my district and my country to the best of my ability . " Says lie Made Race on Own Asked if the " magic name of Roosevelt " had not helped him , Mr. Roosevelt said : " No doubt the name is a great asset but it has its drawbacks . Obviously people know who yeti are , which is an asset , but you necessarily inherit both the people who loved my father and the people who hated my father . I made the campaign on my own two feet . " He was informed that Representative John W. McCormack , Democratic House leader , had said in Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democrat . " Of course I am a Democrat , " Mr. Roosevelt said , adding that he could not discuss committee appointments he was likely to get . " I suppose I will be listed as Democrat-dash-Liberal . " Mr. Roosevelt will leave La Guardia Airport tonight at 7 o'clock on a trip to Europe and Israel . He said his trip to Israel , where he will confer with authorities on the housing situation there , had long been planned and that he had personal business in France and Belgium . He indicated that he would be gone for about ten days and would take his seat in Congress promptly on his return . Tammany Shake-Up Discussed The weakness of the Tammany I organization , made evident in the special election when it could get only 24,352 votes for Justice Shalleck compared to 41,146 for Mr. Roosevelt in a district preponderantly Democratic in enrollment , led immediately to talk of a reorganization of the Democratic organization in New York County . Mayor O'Dwyer , who frequently has indicated his disapproval of the present Tammany leadership , headed by Borough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , chairman of its committee on elections , gave the move for reorganization his blessing by a conference with Frank J. Sampson , former leader , and Robert B. Blaikie , Tammany leader of the Seventh Assembly District , who supported Mr. Roosevelt . Emerging . from an hour 's conference with the Mayor , Mr. Blaikie declared unequivocally that he was for the return of Mr. Sampson to the readership of Tammany . " The present leadership is bankrupt , " Mr. Blaikie said . " It has to be changed . We have to get a Democratic leadership , not a dictatorship , and have a democratic method of selecting candidates , not a hand-picked method . We have to build up a party that has the respect of the people . The people demand a change and I think yesterday 's election showed that . " Sampson Willing to Return Mr. Sampson said he had talked with Mayor O'Dwyer earlier in the day and had brought Mr. Blaikie with him so that the latter could tell the Mayor just what happened at the election . Asked if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I would be happy to take it if it would make for a better organization . " Asked for his opinion on the Tammany situation in view of the special election result , Mayor O'Dwyer said : " I think my position on that has been clear for a long time . Look up your files . " The Mayor referred obviously to his frequent criticism of the present Tammany leadership , which has led many persons to believe that he has sought to remove the Tammany issue from the campaign If , as expected , he is a candidate for re-election . It is the opinion of many persons at City Hall that the election of Mr. Roosevelt , which is welcome to the Mayor , has increased the probability that he will run again . Asked if he would support ? Mr. Sampson for the leadership of Tammany , the Mayor replied that he thought highly of Mr. Sampson but that it would be unfair to him to put him in as leader of Tammany in the existing situation . Mayor Wants Party Change " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frank back until leaders in the Assembly districts are elected fairly by direct vote of their Democratic constituents , " Mr. O'Dwyer said . " Every two years a district leader should be required to stand up and tell what he has been doing . This would bring out good competition . As it is now , some of the leaders are chosen for life and it is impossible to get them out so long as they are elected by members of the county committee . " The present method of electing the Tammany district leaders is unhealthy and undemocratic . This should be changed and those who will change it are the youngsters who showed up yesterday at the polls . That is the lesson of the special election . " The Fair Deal Democrats , who supported Mr. Roosevelt , . have announced that they will oppose Mr. Rogers for renomination with a candidate of their own . The result of the election is conceded to have strengthened their determination . The Liberal party , which twice furnished the balance of votes to elect Representative Jacob K. Javits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ margin that resulted in the election of George Frankenthaler as Sarrogate of New York county , is in a much stronger position by the election of Mr. Roosevelt .
