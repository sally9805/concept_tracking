In 81 years , Charles ( Henry ) Davis of Cape Cod , Philadelphia and New York has accumulated more than a million dollars , a distinguished white mustache , a list of 40 miscellaneous clubs and societies ( including the Bankers Club , National Association for the Protection of Roadside Beauty ) , and a bagful of curious ideas which he will dispense upon request . Last September , Davis , attired in a yachting cap , double-breasted blue jacket with a saucer-sized gold highway badge pinned on the inside , astounded his guests with the simple announcement : " You 're looking at the next President of the United States . " Later he disclosed that " I have the perfect defense against the atomic bomb . " <P> Fortnight ago , eccentric Millionaire-Engineer Davis revealed his version of a fey project for a Dover war memorial pro posed last summer ( TIME , July 29 ) . Davis ' idea : an 80-foot statue of Winston Churchill holding a mammoth cigar over his head like the Statue of Liberty torch , mounted on a 100-foot-high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owed by so many to one man , " which thoroughly squeezed the juice from a great Churchillism . A model ( see cut ) was prepared by a New Hampshire sculptor , Viggo Brandt-Erickson . Davis offered his idea to the mayors of 14 towns on the English Channel coast . <P> Last week flamboyant Davis had an answer wrapped in a typical British understatement . Said Mayor Arthur A. Goodfellow of Dover : " We agree that a memorial to Churchill might be a good thing , but something more modest and utilitarian would be preferable . "
