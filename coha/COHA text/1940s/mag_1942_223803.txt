Solved at last is another great scientific mystery : the structure of the most powerful known chemical-biotin , a rare , growth-promoting vitamin of the B-complex group . Significance : knowledge of its structure may well lead to synthetic manufacture of biotin . So far not more than one-tenth of an ounce of pure biotin has been isolated . Cost : more than $400,000 . <P> Biotin is so potent that it stimulates the growth of yeast cells even when diluted to one part in 500,000,000,000 . One gram dissolved in 25,000,000 gallons of water is enough to meet the vital needs of bacteria . All higher forms of life , including man , also need tiny amounts of biotin for such vital functions as cellular respiration and growth . <P> This fantastic vitamin was isolated in 1936 by Professor Fritz Kgl of Utrecht , Holland but Biochemist Vincent Du Vigneaud of Cornell and his colleagues identified it as an animal vitamin in 1940 . The possible molecular patterns ran into millions . Last January , Dr. Du Vigneaud and colleagues were able to announce that the possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the position of the nitrogen atoms was ascertained , these were cut to two .
