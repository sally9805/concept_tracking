Tojo boasted : " During the last two years Japan has brought her fighting strength to such a level that she is now ready to make use of the earliest opportunity to deal the enemy troops a decisive blow and frustrate all enemy efforts . " Tokyo commentators added : " The day for a large-scale Japanese campaign is drawing close . " As Tojo well knew , he was talking through his hat : he had about as much chance of deciding when the big events would come as Hitler had of deciding D-day in western Europe . He could only guess where the next big blow would fall . <P> Last week : <P> General MacArthur 's U.S. troops hopped 125 miles westward ( from newly won Hollandia ) along the north coast of New Guinea to capture the two Wakde Islands and the adjacent mainland base of Sarmi . <P> The Wakde air strip is within 700 miles - easy land-based bomber range - of the big Jap base of Palau , which probably must be neutralized before any invasion of the Philippines can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be 700 miles to Halmahera on the Vogelkop ( bird 's head ) that is New Guinea 's western end . From Halma hera to Mindanao , southernmost Philippine island , is 400 miles . <P> Once-mighty Truk was attacked in daylight by a lone Navy search plane which bombed two supply ships in the harbor , then compounded the indignity by strafing an airfield . <P> Some 5,000 miles north of Truk , Aleutian-based Navy Ventura bombers attacked several points in the Kurile Islands . One Liberator went all the way to Shimushiri Island , only 400 miles north of Japan proper . Radio Tokyo announced this week that a U.S. carrier force had bombed Marcus Island , 1,200 miles south of Tokyo , for two days . <P> Wake Island , 1,500 miles northeast of Truk , was bombed for the 16th time since a mighty carrier task force leveled the U.S.-owned island last October at a cost of 13 planes . A testimonial to the effectiveness of the October raid : not until last week , when one bomber was shot down , had a U.S. plane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But last week 's most interesting Pacific gesture was a carrier task-force raid on Surabaya on the north coast of Java . Next to Singapore , Surabaya was the biggest non-Japanese naval base in the Far Pacific-bigger than Manila or Hong Kong . <P> Last week 's raid on " the pearl of the Indies " was puny , as carrier raids go nowadays : less than 100 planes , hardly one Essex-class complement . But there were promising factors : 1 ) for the first time Naval forces from the Mountbatten , Nimitz and MacArthur commands joined together ; 2 ) Javanese , who have been wooed incessantly by Japanese propaganda , might begin to doubt that Tojo 's forces were as all-powerful as he claimed ; 3 ) surprisingly few Jap planes rose in defense ; two of these were shot down , 19 others were destroyed on the ground ; at least one ship in Surabaya harbor blew up .
