Stocky , down-to-earth James S. Adams , 45-year-old President of Standard Brands Inc . ( Fleischmann 's Yeast , Royal Baking Powder , etc. ) last week announced that he would ask his 115,000 common stockholders to convert every four shares they now hold into one share of new stock . Brokers raised interested eyebrows : reverse splitting had hardly been heard of on Wall Street since the dog days after the 1929 crash , when some companies used it to give their collapsing shares some semblance of dollar value . <P> Jim Adams ' move was different : his stock is selling near its high for the year , his sales running 20% above last year . And his motivation was right in line with his executive background , first as a key man in the smart , slick advertising firm of Benton &; Bowles and then as executive vice president of Colgate-Palmolive-Peet . <P> When Jim Adams left the soap business for the food business 18 months ago , lumbering Standard Brands ' sales were running only 33% above their level in 1930 , the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competitor , big General Foods , with about the same 1930 sales , had almost doubled its business . During all this time General Foods had some 5,000,000 shares of common outstanding ( and 6,000,000 authorized ) v. 12,600,000 ( and 20,000,000 ) for smaller Standard Brands . Result : in the past few years General 's stock has sold up &; down in the respectable $25-45 area , while Standard 's has dogged around at the $310 level . To publicity-conscious Jim Adams ( and to all his directors ) this was bad business : 1 ) it gave the stock an unwarranted black eye as against the higher-priced stocks of comparable companies ; 2 ) it made the stock less attractive as collateral . <P> But the biggest reason why Jim Adams wants to get his stock out of the cat- &-dog; area is because he figures that it will thereby become a more useful vehicle for expansion . Low-priced stocks usually attract small-time speculators who figure they get more when they buy 100 shares at $5 than 10 shares at $50 ; when a businessman sells out his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue-chip prestige . Thus when Standard bought the Loudon Packing Co . ( V8 Vegetable Juice ) last March , the Loudons insisted on cash , but when General Foods bought out Snider Packing at about the same time , only common stock changed hands . Expansionist Adams , whose stock phrase is " some day we 've got to grow some , " figures that his fiscal contraction should enable Standard Brands to expand .
