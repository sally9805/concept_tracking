txt Kill With or Without Hate The Rex Stout-Dr . Bowie discussion on hate for the Nazis will fall into a practical niche if taken in the light of the following homely parable : " An elderly lady went to her physician with a complaint . She had no appetite . The doctor prescribed two tablespoonfuls of 9. certain dark brown mixture to be taken before meals . The old lady secured the remedy and at the next mealtime took the prescribed dose . After a long wait no appetite came . Disappointed , the dear soul sat down and ate a hearty meal without any appetite . " The lesson is , if you feel hate toward the Nazi Germans , kill them as Mr. Stout prescribes , but if hate does not enter your heart , kill them without hate , as Dr. Bowie advises . The Nazis will pull no daisy petals apart as your shot comes over . ALBERT A. VOLK . New York , Feb. 6 , 1943.                @ @ @ @ @
