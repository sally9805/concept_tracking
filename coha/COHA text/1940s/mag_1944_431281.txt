 | Go north , Young Man Condensed from Future . . Ernest Gruening . . . Governor of Alaska When the boys come back from the war , home will seem like heaven ? for a while . Then a lot of them will get restless , even those lucky enough to have jobs . They 've been places and seen things . The home town will seem too small , too set in its ways . They 'll want more freedom , greater opportunities to make careers for themselves . It was so after the Civil War , when thousands pulled up stake and headed for the frontier . The Young Man listened to Horace Greeley . Across the Mississippi was a vast empty land . Time was adventure . There was free land , wealth in minerals , great plains and forests ? opportunity . And just at that time the frontier became readily accessible by the opening of the transcontinental railways . So the Young Man went West ? ant founded a new empire . There still is a frontier . Alaska too , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an area nearly as large as the United States east of the Mississippi , with only 75,000 per manent inhabitants . In Alaska arc free land , mineral wealth , great for ests . And once again the new frontier is made accessible by new transportation , by air and by road . There will be opportunities of a sort that the old West never dreamed of . But those opportunities will be for a certain kind of people only . Many Alaskans are afraid of this northward migration that is certain to come . They dislike the prospect of the Alaska Highway clogged with jalopies . " Suppose a lot of young fellows come swarming up here after the war , " they say . " What will there be for them to do ? Alaska has always existed on two industries , fish and gold , and in those there is no room for expansion . The salmon catch is limited by conservation laws ? so that there may always be salmon . Most of the best gold prospects are controlled by big companies . A young fellow could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company . But there 's no future for him . " They talk as if Alaska were a " matured economy . " Well , it might be ? for people who are not pioneers . So is any place , any time . For those who have the initiative , the energy , the spirit of adventure , it 's another story . But it will not be an easy life . Probably no easier and no  | harder than the life of those who pioneered the Northwest . Alaska 's farming potentialities have scarcely been touched . It has fewer than 10oo farmers , although there are about 30,0o0 square miles of land , suitable for farming ? an area almost as large as South Carolina . Much land that can still be homesteaded free is near the towns , or connected with markets by road or rail . The Territory has never fed itself . Before the war $4 , o00 , ooo worth of toad was imported annually which could have been grown in Alaska . Finland , with a comparable amount of arable land and similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 500 , o0o but exported , before the war , butter , grain , cheese , livestock . The Paul Satkos , of Richmond , Virginia , are an example of the kind of modern pioneers who are proving that farming in Alaska can be profitable . With seven children , the Satkos crossed the continent , sailed to Alaska in a homemade boat , took up homestead land and established a truck farm near Juneau . Ht was a wilderness , forest-covered , when thew came , but the land was good . ' They built their house of the great trees that grew on t he place , hauling the logs by block and tackle . While building they cleared a little patch of land , and got in their first crop . Ht was back-breaking work , from dawn to dark . That was three years ago . Today the Satko family has a flourishing 16o-acre farm . The people of Juneau who , like the rest of Alaska , have lived largely out of cans , buy all the fresh vegetables the farm can produce . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a paradise of virgin forest and snowcapped peaks . What Satko has done , others with his energy and initiative can do . When dairy farming was suggested as an Alaskan industry , Fairbanks sourdoughs laughed at the idea . You could n't keep cows , they said , there in the interior where the thermometer occasionally drops to 6o below . " They 'd be indoors most of the year eating hay imported at a ruinous cost . But Charlie Creamer of Fairbanks had a different idea . lie experimented with growing several kinds of feed ? found that , although the growing season is short , the hours of daylight are so long that a crop can be harvested . He imported a few Holsteins . Now he has a herd of So and a dairy that would be a show-place anywhere in the U. S. He sells all the milk he can produce to Fairbanks people at 25 cents a quart ? could sell much more . So could Father Edgar Gallant , who helps support his Pius X mission in Skagway by operating the town 's dairy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he sells now . Alaskans were convinced that the Aleutian Islands would never he of any commercial use . No trees , no arable soil , no minerals ? and the worst climate in the world . But C. C. Eubank came pioneering from  | Ogden , Utah . He saw that the Aleutians had one thing : luxuriant grass . He secured grazing rights on Umnak Island and imported some sheep , an animal that thrives in the rawest and wettest weather . He found that the Aleutian elimate grew wool that was much longer and heavier than the average . Before war suspended his operations , he had built a profitable flock of 14,000 . To make the average mink coat takes So pelts ? each of which brings from $8 to $22 to the trapper or breeder . The chief expense of producing ranch-bred mink is feed . Probably nowhere else in the world are there so many fish ? a mink 's chief food ? as on the Alaskan coasts . The waste of a salmon cannery could feed all the mink on Fifth Avenue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homestead tract near a cannery got his feed costs down to one cent per mink per day . A year 's work by him , singlehanded , puts five more tnink coats in circulation . Alaska aviation has had two phases . First was the exciting era of the bush pilots , whose exploits are already as fabulous as those of the two-gun sheriffs of the old West . They explored the air routes in wild unknown country . Fighting the williwaws and arctic storms , they carried mail to far-off posts , set prospectors clown in remote wilderness , carried fur traders to the arctic coast . As a result of this pioneering , Alaska to its farthest corners is a network of routes flown regularly by wellequipped lines . In Alaska tomorrow will converge the air routes which are the shortest way from the U. S. to Asia , to an area where lives half the population of the earth . From Chicago to Chungking , via Alaska , is 4300 miles shorter than by the old South Pacific way . At Ladd Field in Fairbanks you see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is full of transport pilots . You feel that this is not a remote frontier but one of the centers of a rapidly shrinking world . As air travel grows , Alaskan towns that arc now little more than villages will contain warehouses , terminals , plane repair shops , hotels . Not a " matured economy " for the young man with imagination . After the war there will be a boom in tourist business ? people will want relaxation front the tensions of war . And for some time to come Europe will not be a pleasant place to go . Alaska is perhaps the grandest playground on earth . It is hard to write without superlatives of a land where peaks loftier than any in the U. S. rise from the deep blue ocean , where the islands are numbered in the thousands . Ht 's the place to catch the biggest fish , to hunt the biggest game , to sail , to camp , to explore ? or just to sit on the porch and look at scenery . It has n't been more exploited because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make the  | famous voyage up the Inside Passage required nearly a month and $7oo or $8oo . After the war , if the promise of cheap air transport is fulfilled , he can do it in two weeks for $3oo ? and see much more of Alaska . In anticipation of this , roads and motor tours , hunting and fishing - camps , are being projected . Besides gold , Alaska has substantial deposits of nickel , platinum , tungsten , chromite , quicksilver , tin , oil and coal . They are not just lying around to be picked up with little effort . But they are there for those who know how to seek and exploit them . When Earl Ohmer came to Alaska in 1916 he thought that the salmon industry had little to offer to a newcomer . He turned his attention to shrimp ? built his own boat , experimented with the best methods of catching and canning them . Now his annual sales are over $350 , o0o . There 's a man on the Yukon who has a special recipe for pickling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Each of them has built up a comfortable , growing little business . Off the shores of Bristol Bay and along the Aleutians swarm millions of king crabs . The Japs knew all about these . Most grocery stores in the U. S. had Japanese canned crab meat that had been caught there . The fish and Wildlife Service in Alaska has published a survey of the best methods of catching and canning king crabs : $50oo buys a suitable boat ; $15,0oo equips a complete canning plant . More fish products await marketing ? such specialities as fish-liver sausages , smoked oysters , seaweed pickle , caviar , smoked black cod , many others . These enterprises could be developed with small capital . About 2o0 , oo0,0oo pounds of salmon waste is thrown away annually in Alaska . Yet fish meal is a valuable commodity and not expensive to produce . In one area 2ooo tons could be produced annually from raw material to be had merely for the cost of collection . Southeastern Alaska has the largest virgin stands of spruce and hemlock left on the continent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rotted on the ground . Now millions of feet are being logged , floated in huge rafts down the Inside Passage , used in plane construction . There will be great demand for raw materials to rebuild a war-ravaged world , and the processing of this lumber could ? and should ? take place in Alaska . A new country is always short of doctors and dentists . There was a dentist in Seattle who studied the map of Alaska , saw how many tiny settlements were dotted all along the coast , far from the nearest town . He bought a power boat , stocked it with instruments , spent spring and summer cruising the coast . His floating dental office was a godsend to the inhabitants and a gold mine for himself . Another dentist covers the in-  | terior by plane . His practice extends over hundreds of miles ? he ca n't begin to take care of it all . In a new country some of the best opportunities are in servicing the population . What chance will there be in postwar Alaska for drugstores , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? It depends , of course , on how rapidly the population grows . A very large , permanent military establishment is certain to be maintained in Alaska after the war . There will be wives and children as well as soldiers ? a considerable population to feed and supply , educate and entertain . Alaska after the war is the place for he man with a little capital ? with 1 ; 150o , $50oo , $15 , ooo . If he mixes his capital with brains he can multiply his stake faster there than in a more developed country . But anyone settling in Alaska must have pioneer hardihood . It is n't just the cold and the long winter darkness . In the parts of Alaska where most inhabitants live it seldom gets much below zero . even in the cold interior it 's little if any colder than in North Dakota . The short days of winter are more than balanced by the long ones of summer . Rather it is that much of Alaska still lives a frontier life . Juneau , Anchorage , Fairbanks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their movies , even one or two smart little bars and nightclubs . But an Alaskan city is still more mining camp than metropolis . Behind its facade of shops Fairbanks is a log-cabin settlement . Anchorage has n't got around to landscaping itself ? but for one paved avenue , it 's still raw mud and slush . And in the little places out in the bush ? there you have real isolation . You feel that man has made only the smallest beginnings against a stark and rugged land . Alaska is no place for the man or woman who must have the constant support and reassurance of civilization . But there are ample compensations . For the pioneer , rugged peaks are better than trimmed lawns ? he wants a land that challenges a man , a land where the dignity of the individual is more important than money in the hank , a land where you can make your life whatever you wish to make it . That is Alaska .                 @ @ @ @
