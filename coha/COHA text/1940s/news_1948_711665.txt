txt Though the Soviet Government has not yet commented officially on the Evatt-Lie appeal to the Big Four to get together for direct settlement of the Berlin issuc , observers here confidently expect a wart response . The Moscow officialine all . along has been that the Berlin i issue is a subject exclusively concerning the four occupying powers . The Soviets have based their opposition to the Berlin matter being placed before the Security Council on these ' grounds . On the other hand , the Soviets have constantly and continually voiced readiness to continue or renew direct the Berlin talks at any level , preferably a higher level . The Russians would be willing to talk as long as the Berlin blockade is in effect , but have refused to lift it in advance of any negotiation . The western powers say that to negotiate while the blockade exists would be to negotiate " under duress , " It is recalled here that as far back as May , when the Berlin issue had not yet ripened , the Soviet reacted most favorably to Henry A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which urged direct Soviet-American negotiations to settle outstanding issues , including Germany , This incident served as basis for a major peace offensive by Soviet propagandists . Thus  --  regardless of the attitude of Washington , London , and Paris toward the well-meant initiative of Herbert V. Evatt and Trygve Lie  --  the Soviets apparently cheer it as just what they have been calling for all along .
