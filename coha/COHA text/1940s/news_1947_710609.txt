txt BRITAIN CA N'T WAIT FOR MARSHALL AID AS CRISIS MOUNTS Financial Condition Is Called Worst Since Her Plight on Eve of World War COMMONS REPORT DUE Douglas Will See Clayton to Stress Need to Alter Terms of Credit Accord By MALLORY BROWNE Special to Tam l  --  Icw Yoss Times . LONDON , Aug. ** economic crisis is so grave that she will not be able to wait for eventual aid under the Marshall proposal . This , it was learned authoritatively today , is what underlies the expectation in London that the British Government 's statement in Parliament next Wednesday on the economic situation will be the gray est pronouncement since the declaration of war in 1939 . Lewis W. Douglas , United States Ambassador to Britain , is flying to Paris tomorrow to discuss with William L. Clayton , Under-Secretary of State for Economic Affairs , the growing feeling in British Government quarters that the full gravity and urgency of Britain 's crisis is not fully understood in Washington . Will Convey Britain 's Fear Ostensibly Mr. Douglas ' trip is for the purpose of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production and other economic topics arising out of the Marshall plan talks in Paris and the International Trade Organization conference in Geneva . It is understood on good authority , however , that Mr. Douglas also will convey to Mr. Clayton the mounting fears in London that Britain 's dollar crisis may become a grave sterling crisis in a matter of weeks , thus threatening the stability of Britain 's currency . The accelerated rate of drawings on Britain 's dollar credits in the United States , attributed in wellinformed circles here to the fact that sterling for current transactions was made convertible last month under the provisions of the United States loan agreement , is regarded as a serious menace not only to remaining dollar credits but to Britain 's vital gold and dollar reserves . Dollars Near Exhaustion Latest authoritative estimates in London are that at the present rate the United States loan will be exhausted by the end of September . Even taking into account Britain 's drastic program of import cuts and other measures to reduce dollar expenditures that the Government will present to Parliament Wednesday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by about the middle of October . There is a growing feeling , therefore , that the tempo of the economic crisis , and particularly of the dollar shortage , has now risen to a point where aid sometime next spring under the Marshall proposal would come too late . The British Government is reluctant to put the problem in this des // perate form . Britain has not asked the United States for any interim aid to tide her over the period between the exhaustion of dollar credits and the time  --  estimated at some time next February or March ? when Britain might hope for some assistance under the Marshall plan . The complications that such a demand would raise with Congress are appreciated in London , though perhaps not fully . But the urgent nature of Britain 's economic needs was fully explained to Mr. Clayton when he was in London last month . Without actually having asked for it in so many words the British thought they had made clear a case for relief from the United States in particular in the non-discrimination clause of the loan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sterling area what she can get in the United States . They hoped , also , that Mr. Clayton had been impressed with the dangers inherent in the convertibility clauses of the loan agreement . But weeks have gone by and nothing has come of the strong case for relief put up to Mr. Clayton . The convertibility of sterling went into effect July 15 and since then Britain has had to draw on her dollars heavily to , cover the convertibility of sterling for current transactions , notably for Argentina , Spain and Canada . Billion of Loan Left With only $1,000,000,000 of the loan left the British feel increasingly that they can not wait . That is why Britain will serve notice in Geneva that she will not agree to sign a multilateral trade agreement that includes the principle of nondiscrimination . Now the British are wondering whether they can avoid taking a similar step to stop even the worse dollar leak inherent in the convertibility clause . A campaign actually has begun in the British press in favor of declaring that the convertibility clause is " unworkable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States for reconsideration of the terms of the loan agreement provided in Article 12 . An example of this was a letter in The Times of London today , calling on the Government to take such action . Written by Nicholas Davenport , a member of the National Investment Council , the letter said that dollar losses under convertibility has amounted to a " flight from free sterling . " " This must be stopped at once , " Mr. Davenport said . " We did not borrow from America to provide foreign countries with dollars but our work people with food and our factories with raw materials . If we are to survive as a great trading nation we can not allow our ' last reserves of gold and dollars to disappear down the drain of convertibility clause . " This feeling is shared in some Government circles at least . The question is being asked how Britain got into such a situation . There is some tendency to condemn Hugh Dalton , Chancellor of the Exchequer , for having underestimated the effect that making sterling convertible would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was unaware of the fact that not only Britain but Canada , Argentina , Spain and other countries also were suffering from serious dollar shortages . Argentina 's reserves , for instance , are now said here to have dropped in a year from $1,500,000,000 to $000,000,000 . ? The Government defense is that the whole world is in a grip of a dollar famine , that is rapidly becoming so severe that ? it will produce deflation and unemployment everywhere unless the United States acts quickly to relieve it . In United States quarters in London , it was pointed out that the British Government could do more than it was doing to relieve its own difficulties . The British reply is that measures to be announced next week will prove Britain 's readiness to do everything possible to help herself . All reports agree that the measures will be far-reaching and drastic . Working over the August bank holiday week-end for the first time since the days of the Battle of Britain , leading members of the Cabinet labored today to complete a program . The figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ import cuts . The details are still being worked out but are understood to include meat , wheat and oil , especially gasoline .
