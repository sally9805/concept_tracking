WEEKEND LEAVE A Story MARGHANITA LASKI W HEN the telegram came at last Muriel Capes was ready for it . Her blue fiber suitcase , bought the first week of the war , lay almost unused on the cloakroom shelf . She lifted it down , dusted it carefully , then carried it into her bedroom where she spread out on the bed the clothes that were on the list she had so often made and remade , written out again and again . First on the list was her saxe-blue coat and her blue art-crepe dress that matched it . She had bought these with Reg on that wonderful leave after he had come home safely from Dunkirk . They had locked the bright green front door of the Totteridge bungalow and gone off to London in the Tube . Reg had given her lunch at the Trocadero and then , after he had listened smilingly to her protests about the extravagance of it , had told her that he had been recommended for a commission . Next , the navy suede shoes and bag she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ensemble when she went with Reg to Buckingham Palace to see him get his D.C.M. from the King . That was just a week before his unit was posted to Northern Ireland , and when his commission came through the first thing she knew about it was a letter from the Army Pay Office asking her to return her allowance book . . Muriel lifted her new blue straw hat from its tissue paper wrappings . It was n't the hat she had worn for the investiturenor the one she had bought two years later when there seemed a chance that Reg might be sent back to England . This hat was a really up-to-date model , and even a little more expensive than the other two had been . Muriel was a patriotic Englishwoman , but when the Daily Mirror assured her that a new coupon-free hat was just what her morale was crying out for , she went straight off and bought one from Madame Estelle who had far and away the smartest shop in Totteridge . Next came undies ; she would wear her blue flowered silk petticoat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'd kept since the beginning of the war . And as for a nightgown  --  only one choice was possible , the peach satin she had worn in the hotel in Bournemouth that night of October , 1938 , when she and Reg were married . Funny to think that going down to Bournemouth in the train was the first time they 'd really quarreled , and on their wedding day , too . It was over such a silly little thing , whether Mr. Chamberlain had been right to fly to Munich as he did and make a peace with Hitler . Muriel did n't see there could be two ways about it . Surely anything was better than a war , and it was n't as if those Sudeten were n't really German anyway . But Reg had seemed really cut up about it , talking about " national shame " and things like that , and as soon as they got back from their honeymoon he 'd gone off and joined the Territorials , which meant they missed their holiday in August 1940 because Reg was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been sent off to France with the very first draft . But now everything was going to be all right at last . Reg 's unit had been sent back to England , to Bedford to be exact , and Reg 's last letter had said they were likely to be there for some time . " It does n't look as if I 'll get a long leave for quite a while , " he 'd written , " but as soon as I have a fairly clear weekend ahead I 'll send you a wire , and you pack your things and come right away . get a room at the Crown , which seems to be the best pub here , and you go straight there and wait till I turn up . " ND now the telegram was here . In less than twenty-four hours she would be in her first bus on her way to Reg . Yet , under all her happy excitement at the thought of seeing him again after so long , she was nervous . The man she had said gooclby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Woods at Number 49 and young Tommy Wilson from " Ramona . " But now Reg was Lieutenant Capes of the Gunners , and no one else in Hillside Avenue had a husband or a brother or a son with a commission . All the papers and magazines that Muriel was so fond of told of girls and women just like herself who easily and naturally mixed with officers ; but deep down Muriel felt that there must be some indefinable difference between herself and these women although , as she knew from those same magazines , she wore the same clothes that they did and served the same food at afternoon tea and talked the same English , not like speaking Cockney or anything dreadful like that . So she did her best to thrust her Fears out of her mind and went on with her packing . Hairbrush , comb , clean handkerchiefs , her Iast bottle of Soir-en-Paris . . . . But as the bus deposited her at the bus station in Bedford , she was distinctly ill at ease . Surely officers ' wives did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter . Did Reg , she wondered , know the right thing to do , not having been commissioned from the start , as you might say ? Nervously she asked a policeman the way to the Crown , then set off down the main street , noticing , as she went , that you could get Post Toasties at all the grocers in Bedford , which was more than you could do in Tottcridge . The Crown was n't a pub at all ! It was an enormous hotel like the ones they 'd seen on the East Cliff at Bournemouth . Wondering whether she 'd come to the right place after all , Muriel went up the broad circular stairs , through the , swing door and into the lounge . T WAS teatime , and all over the lounge I were dotted little tables . Music was spouting from a large radio and the lounge was crowded with people . A page in uniform came forward and took Muriel 's suitcase . " Have you booked , Madam ? " he asked . Muriel said yes , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed the page to a large desk in the corner . On hearing her name the girl behind the desk became affable . " We 'd been expecting you earlier , " she said cheerfully . " Mr. Capes thought you 'd be coming on the 3:30 train . He said to be sure you had some tea , and he hoped he 'd be with you in the lounge about six . Number 336 it is , looking over the river . " She handed a key to the page , who picked up Muriel 's case again and waited for her to follow him to the lift . Arriving at number 336 the page-boy put her suitcase on a stand by the door and waited . It suddenly occurred to Muriel that he expected a tip . She found sixpence and he took it with a proper mixture of gratitude and surprise , so that Muriel wondered if she 'd done the right thing after all . How exciting and wonderful the hotel bedroom was ! There were silk net curtains at the windows and there was central heating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a built-in wardrobe with a light inside that turned on when you opened it , and a telephone beside the bed with buttons to press for a waiter and a chambermaid . There was even a private bathroom with a built-in bath and a bath towel waiting on a heated rail . Suddenly Muriel felt that she was going to enjoy herself . She unpacked carefully and neatly , putting her possessions away in drawers , her folded tissue paper back in the case . It was five when I arrived , she said to herself , so if I have a nice hot bath I 'll just be ready for Reg at six . She would n't admit the thought that a nice hot bath would save her from having to go and have tea alone in the lounge . Instead she turned on the tap and watched the water steaming and splashing in . But even though she took as long as she possibly could and powdered her face ever so carefully and pinched her soft brown hair back into its neatly marcelled waves , it was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready . She wondered whether she ought to wear her hat to go down into the lounge . It seemed a pity , somehow , when she 'd done her hair so nicely and so she decided not to and , picking up her bag , made her way downstairs , a A was over now and the lounge was lmost almost empty . In one corner a young man in naval uniform whispered to a girl , Two children were playing a card game with their mother . Muriel sat down at a little table and prepared to wait , doubtful whether it was quite all right to be there by herself with no man to lend her respectability . The swing-doors flashed round . Three women came in and made their way to a table . One was tall and fair with a leopard-skin coat and no hat . The other two wore tweed suits . A waiter came toward them and the fair woman said , " Shall we wait for the others , or start in ? " The older woman in tweeds said to the waiter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sherry ? Three , then . " The third woman who was small and dark , and looked , Muriel thought , something like a film star , took a gold cigarette case out of her bag and handed it round . Before the war , one of Muriel 's chief pleasures had been watching ladies like these . When she was working as a shorthand-typist in Victoria Street , she and the other girls would often spend their lunch-hour watching weddings at St. Margaret 's or walking round the little streets and squares of Westminster to see the ladies and gentlemen coming and going . Even after she was married , she and Mrs. Woods often took the Tube up to London andwalked up and down Bond Street to have a real good look at the shops and , above all , at the people who used them . But in those days the whole thing was different . Despite the illusion sedulously fostered by Muriel 's favorite papers that she and they were exactly the same , apart from living in different districts , she knew , once she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that her life and theirs were never likely to converge . Now , by the fact of Reg 's promotion , she was about to enter their ranks . It was past six o'clock and the lounge was filling up . The swing-doors spun feverishly round , throwing in all manner of people , men and women in uniform , men and women in civilian clothes , people who swarmed into the big chairs round the little tables , ordered drinks , and talked in a noisy hum that almost drowned the dance music from the radio in the corner . Yet still the three women in the center held Muriel 's attention . Always , in a room that is full of groups of people , there is one that will stand out and draw the eyes through some indefinable and possibly quite spurious superiority that seems to emanate from them . Three officers swung through the door , but none of them was Reg . One , Muriel noticed , was a Colonel , the others a Captain and a Lieutenant . They went straight to the three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her wholly compact and infinitely desirable . At last Reg came , pushing through the door with assurance . His eyes wandered round the room , not seeing her , and came to rest on the group in the center . The tall fair woman raised her hand and he went across to them . Muriel saw them telling him to sit down , to have a drink , to be one of them . But then he saw Muriel . She watched him explaining to those people , leaving them and corning over to her . H is voice had changed . That was the first thing she noticed about him . Instead of the voice she could always call up from her memory , it had become colorless and strange , something like the voices of the men at the center table which seemed to her unidentifiable one from the other . But what he was saying was familiar , how he loved her and how he had missed her . He reached out his hand and took hers under the table , and she felt again that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Suddenly they were gay together . He ordered drinks , a sherry for her , a large pint of beer for himself . He offered her a cigarette and they laughed to think he 'd forgotten she did n't smoke . He asked her about the garden  --  had she been able to find someone to dig it over for her and had she remembered to put down the lime ? She told him that Mr. Watts was Chief Warden now , and how they 'd made twelve pound ten for the Red Cross at the last sale , and that Mary Staple had called her little girl Jennifer Ann . Then they went into the hotel restaurant to have dinner and Muriel listened while Reg talked to her about Ireland and the people he 'd met there and how much he liked his work and how he was going to be made a Captain but she was n't to mention it yet . They had half a bottle of sweet white wine together because red wine always gave Muriel a headache . Every now and again Reg clasped her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right . And as she sat and chatted happily with Reg , Muriel seemed to see Hillside Avenue and the green-painted bungalow speeding rapidly away from her like a view passed in a train . Its connection with Muriel Capes sipping her wine in the Bedford Hotel seemed more and more tenuous and remote . Into her mind there came instead a confused tangle of visions  --  Vogue , which she 'd always tried to get hold of in the hairdresser 's , incomprehensible jokes in Punch , the damp smoothness of the Times ; lingerie shops off Bond Street and gardenias for sale in Piccadilly ; purple bunches of grapes in Fortnum and Mason 's windows and a memory of perfume that was rich and complicated and most unlike the easy sweetness of Soir-en-Paris. a-raHE perfume , at least , was real . Reg I was standing up and saying . " This is my wife . Muriel , this is Mrs. Lacy , " and the oldest of the three women had stopped at their table and was smiling nicely at Muriel . She said , " Reggie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us when you 've finished dinner , " and strode away to a table in the corner , her perfume floating on the air behind her . Reg said , " That 's the Colonel 's wife . She was in Ireland with us and so was Lady Forrest , the fair one . Captain Trevor 's wife joined us when we came here . I think they 're all working in the British Restaurant or something like that . " Funny sort of work for them to be doing , thought Muriel , washing up and scraping dirty plates and waiting on all sorts of people . She 'd pictured them driving ambulances or working in white uniforms in officers ' convalescent homes . She said , " Why did Mrs. Lacy call you Reggie ? " He said easily , " Oh , everybody does . Why do n't you ? I think I prefer it to Reg . " I suppose Reggie does sound superior , she thought , but Reg is more natural somehow . " I 'll try , " she said , ready to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After dinner , Reggie steered her towards the others in the lounge . Everyone was drinking beer , an incredible amount of beer , it seemed to Muriel . The women talked about their children , all , it seemed , left with Nannies in country homes . They talked about the servant problem and how it was practically impossible to get a chicken for the table and how the gardener had to leave the lawns unmown and go to work on the farm to avoid being called up and how difficult it was to get around now they 'd cut out the basic petrol ration and how long the cleaners took to send anything back . Their problems were Muriel 's  --  in kind but not in scale . Trying to get pork sausage off the ration seemed puny beside the fight for a fifteen-shilling chicken , and struggling onto a crowded bus with a heavy shopping-bag was nothing beside the problem of having no petrol for the car . She would have liked to tell them how hard it was to get a man to do a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patch of grass beside the cedar-shaded lawns she saw in her mind , stretching far beyond the whole length of Hillside Avenue ? They tried to draw her into the conversation , but their everyday problems were much too different from hers . She wonderedwhythe women 's papers , who told you so exactly how to dress and entertain like these people , did n't tell you how to talk with them . Why , she thought , it 's worse than being with foreigners ! But Reg did n't seem to find any difficulty . She looked across at him , seeing him talking and laughing , absolutely at ease , using the same voice as those people , making the same jokes . She heard herself saying , " Reg , I 'm ever so tired . Do you think these kind people would excuse us if we went off to bye-bye ? " The men were standing up , the women hoping that she 'd have a good night , feel rested in the morning . Mrs. Lacy said , " Would you like to meet us for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is taking a Church Parade , and what with one thing and another I do n't suppose he 'll be with you till lunchtime . " Muriel said she 'd Iove to . She was delighted and relieved that they wanted to see her again and to have her with them . Just before they went to sleep she said , " Reg , do you think I could come and live here Iike the others ? We could let the house ever so well , and I 'd love to be with you all the time I can . " Reg said , " I was hoping you 'd want to . You could do some voluntary work here to stop you feeling lonely in the daytime . I must say , I 'd like to have my wife with me too , instead of feeling jealous of the others all the time . " He pulled her to him and she was happy and reassured . N EN-E. morning they had breakfast in bed . Reg got up early and went off to the barracks , leaving Muriel with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a walk . " Do n't forget , " he added , " that you 're meeting Mrs. Lacy at twelve . " Muriel read through the Sunday Graphic and then got up and went and sat on a bench by the river . Her shoes were n't suitable for walking , and in any case she wanted to have a real good think about the problem that confronted her . She recognized it easily , She had often read about it . Her husband had climbed out of his class and was going up and up . In peacetime he 'd probably never had the chance to do so , but he was obviously afirst-class soldier and a likable man . These people accepted him and he fitted in with them . Of course , he 'd always read a lot and been interested in politics and things like that , but whatever the reason , he was perfectly confident and at ease with them . But she was n't . The women 's papers had let her down . She had nothing in common with the wives of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an officer 's wife . And , for all their politeness and kindness , that was n't enough . Shc faced up to the problem with a cold despair . If I stay at home where I 'm comfortable with people I like , she thought , I 'll lose Reg as sure as fate . He 'll never come back to Totteridge after all this , and I 'll just be one of those wives who could n't keep up and had to be left behind . If I want to keep Reg , I 've got to come here and work in the British Restaurant and wear those awful tweeds and those thick walking-shoes and learn to fit in . MWELVE struck somewhere in the town . I She walked back to the hotel to meet Mrs. Lacy and Lady Forrest in the lounge . They waved to her cheerfully . " What 'll it be ? " " A sherry , please , " said Muriel and sat down and refused a cigarette and gaily said , " Here 's how ! " when the sherry arrived . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Muriel asked where Mrs. Trevor was , and was told that she and her husband had dashed home to see the children because it was the oldest girl 's birthday . They talked about the shortage of toys and how hard it was to find anything to give children these days , and Muriel told them about her nephew , little Michael , and how his favorite game was tearing up old newspapers . " And they 're just as much use to the salvage torn as whole , " she said , " though it means they 've never got a hit fit to take to the butcher . " The others laughed , and soon they were talking about the disadvantages of living in a hotel . " We 're always talking about taking a furnished flat here , " said Lady Forrest , " but if we do , the unit 's quite certain to be moved next day . " " You 're going to join us here , are n't you ? " Mrs. Lacy asked Muriel , but before she could answer , Colonel Lacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Hi , Reggie , what have you done with George ? " and Reg laughed at her and said , " He 's trying to break loose from a red-tape entanglement . " They all laughed and Colonel Lacy turned to Muriel and explained , " Sally 's husband is my adjutant and I 'm afraid he 's finding it rather heavy going this morning . " But soon he came and joined them , and they were all drinking and talking and laughing together . There was a pause in the chatter , Colonel Lacy said to Muriel , " Well , Mrs. Capes , I hear you 've decided to come and settle down with us and keep this husband of yours in order . " They were all looking at her expectantly . She had only to say yes , and she and Reg could go ahead together into the future . She said , " It 's ever so kind of you , Colonel , but I do n't really see how I can . feel it 's my job to stay at home and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said it , Hillside Avenue and the green-painted bungalow swung comfortingly into view . She could n't quite make out if the stranger , Reggie , was there with her or not . I Came Back from Poland I CAME back from Poland not long ago with a suitcase full of statistics , data on industry , land reform , and nationalization plans , and with a big notebook full of interviews with ministers , members of parliament , and editors of newspapers . I started to write a series of articles explaining all about Poland 's economic and political problems . But after writing a few pages I stopped . I remembered that before going to Poland I had read scores of similar articles ; and they had not helped me much to understand a country which I had known so well before the war . I put my statistics aside and jotted down a few things which seem to me to explain better than anything else the mind of a people who have been twisted beyond comprehension by the fist of fate .

It was summer when I saw them , and the girls were wearing light summer dresses with short sleeves . Each of them had a concentration camp number tattooed on her forearm .
