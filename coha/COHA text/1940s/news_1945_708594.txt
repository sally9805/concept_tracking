txt But , far from ascribing myself any other function to gold , I deplore the fact that gold has been accepted as a trustworthy standard . It is only a trustworthy medium . As to Mr. Cortney 's letter , I agree that the great depression following the stock market crash of 1929 Was mainly due to a collapse of credit . In my " 100% Money " I have advocated as remedy a return to the oldest , soundest and most conservative system of deposit banking , namely , the system by which every dollar of a demand deposit shall have behind it a dollar of reserve , thus applying to " deposit money " the same principle now used over a century by the Bank of England under which every pound sterling of the bank 's notes has ( beyond a certain point ) had to have a pound of reserve behind it . I may add that several hundred American economists have endorsed this 100 per cent reserve idea applied to deposits and that the few bankers who have made a thorough study of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and for the best interests of banking . Had we such credit control throughout the world the great depression would not have been so great ; but even so , the old , unregulated gold standard would not have been a very stable standard . Stabilization Stressed And even conceding that it might have been sufficiently stable to have prevented the great degree of unemployment and discontent out of which Hitler and this war developed , the fact remains that the gold standard without such credit control is futile as a defense against inflation and deflation . It is a mockery to call it a standard unless it is stabilized ; and to be stabilized two sorts of control arc necessary ? credit control and gold control . The only object of this letter is to refute the criticisms of my first letter and not to enter into a discussion of all the statements in Mr. Cortney 's letter . But I must take issue with Mr. Cortney 's statement that " the height of the boom in the Twenties and the depth of the following collapse were due precisely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is a most extraordinary statement and , so far as I know , without the slightest foundation . There have been , in all history , only two brief efforts to stabilize the price level . One was the unofficial and behind-the-scenes work of Benjamin Strong , governor of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , with the cooperation of the governors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston , Philadelphia , Cleveland and Chicago . It consisted of a new utilization of the openmarket operations , buying bonds to put money into circulation and so ward off impending deflation and , reversely , selling bonds to withdraw money from circulation and so ward off impending inflation . The plan worked , and worked well ; for as long as Governor Strong was at the helm the price level was kept stable from the time he began this plan in 1922 until he resigned and died in 1928 . As long as this stabilization went on we had increasing prosperity . After it was discontinued came the stock market crash and the depression . The other case was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last is the only example of an official stabilization . The Swedes had sent to Governor Strong to learn his methods , which they imitated . The Swedish official index number of the price ' level varied less than 1 per cent for the five years during which the plan was followed . Probably no other five years in history in any country showed such stability ; and , according to the record , Sweden enjoyed more prosperity in those five years than did any other country . The only real solution of these problems must be international . The Bretton Woods proposal for a stabilization fund points the way . It aims , as the Swedish merchants did , and as Schacht did , at stable foreign exchange . For this purpose it makes use of gold as a common medium of exchange in foreign trade . But it also provides for e , concerted change in the price of gold when necessary . The fourth writer , C. R. Williams , for some reason which I can not fathom , seems to think that my wholly complimentary reference to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea never occurred to me , and what immediately followed regarding money had no reference whatever to him . I disagree violently with Mr. Williams when he says that " the Disagrees on TVA . Issue To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMER : Your editorial of April 27 " The TVA Chairman " is not compatible with the reasoned judgment and fair-mindedness usually ascribed to THE NEW YORE TIMES . Have you forgotten that TVA was set up originally as a public yardstick to measure the fairness of privately owned utility rates ? Do you not recall the castigation of private companies which accompanied the first announcement of TVA yardstick rates ? Do you remember that these yardstick rates were later discredited because the public soon recognized their short measure ? Do you not recall the threats of ruin to all privately owned utility investments in the valley because they were going to be put out of business without any compensation by having their markets taken over bodily by TVA , and do you recall that when fairminded public opinion rebelled against such ruthlessness a token offer was made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the owners ? It was at this point that Mr. Wendell Willkie became a national figure by calling on the President to have his own Securities Exchange Commission set . a fair value on the property to be taken over . Do you not remember that TVA was then compelled to enter negotiations with Commonwealth and Southern to arrive at an honest value for these properties , and then how the Congress followed up by appropriating the full purchase price agreed to by Mr. Willkie ? Of course , the TVA has been a great boon to its area of operation . So would any XYZ which had spent a billion dollars of the taxpayers ' money in the XYZ area , all contributed by the nation at large . The prosperity of the region is also abetted by continuing subsidies . By one the TVA consumers are relieved of their fair share of taxes . If TVA had paid seederal taxes on the same basis as many private utilities , it would have had to add $20,000,000 to its bills to customers . This is an annual gift from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 27 entitled " Russia 's Three Votes , " it occurs to me that this controversy is strangely reminiscent of the similar problem prevailing at the time the United States Constitution was being drafted . The question of whether to give all States1 equal representation , or whether be base representation on size , was , as everyone knows , compromised by adopting the expedient of a bicameral Congress , with membership in one house equal for all States and that in the other apportioned on the basis of population . I suggest that the same plan might be worthy of consideration here . Roe:1ND VOORHEES . Charleston , W.

And does the pub licity argument explain why Ukrain , and White Russia were singled out fo ? the honor ? As Topics of The Times makes i clear , the relative importance n Ukraine and White Russia among thee sister republics offers no clue to th Soviet Government 's choice . Accord ing to the census of 1939 the Russian Socialist Federated Soviet Republi ( had a population of 109.3 million Ukraine , 31 million ; White Russia 5.6 million ; Uzbek , 6.3 million ; Kazakh 6.1 million .

Soviet Republics ? Latvia , Estonia Lithuania and the Karelian-Finnish Re public -- did not contribute their fail share to the struggle against Germany . The true explanation must be sought . I think , in the special position occupied by Soviet Ukraine and White Russia with reference to the thorny Polish question . The fourth partition of Po , land by virtue of the Hitler-Stalin agreement in the autumn of 1939 transferred to the Soviet Union some 76,000 square miles of former Polish territory which were divided between Soviet Ukraine and White Russia .

As to Kemmerer 's , there seems to be little need for comment , since , as I see it , his is " a distinction without a difference . " For I agree that a managed gold standard should be as automatic and as little managed as possible . As to Mr. Malatzky 's letter , he says that both Lord Keynes and I ascribe functions to gold which it was never meant to perform and that " the one and only function of gold is to act as a generally acceptable medium of exchange .
