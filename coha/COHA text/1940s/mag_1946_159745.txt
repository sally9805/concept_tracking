Canada 's International Nickel Co . Ltd. , and its subsidiaries own 90% of the world 's nickel ore ; they supply 90% of U.S. nickel needs . Come good times or bad , the price of nickel , 35 a pound , has not changed in 18 years . In the same period even monopolistic Alcoa dropped the price of aluminum from 24 to 14 . Last week the U.S. ' Government , despite pressure from the Canadian Government , finally took note of this . <P> In New York , the Anti-Trust Division of the Department of Justice filed a complaint against Inco , its wholly owned U.S. subsidiary , International Nickel Co . Inc. , and three U.S. officers of both companies , President Robert C. Stanley , Executive Vice President John F. Thompson , Vice President Paul D. Merica . The charges : 1 ) conspiracy to prevent competition in the nickel industry , 2 ) fixing prices , 3 ) making cartel agreements with I. G. Farbenindustrie , A. G. and two French companies to prevent competition and peg prices in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nickel shipments to Farben in 1937 that Germany had built up a stockpile of Canadian-mined nickel for the German war machine . ( Nickel is used to make armor plate . ) <P> Actually , Justice charged , the industry ceased to be competitive in 1902 , when Steelman Charles Schwab arranged a merger between Canadian companies with plenty of nickel ore and U.S. companies with the chemical process for separating nickel from copper . Holdings of the combine ( $135,000,000 worth of mines , smelting and refining ) were consolidated under Inco , Ltd. in 1928 . Inco 's sales last year : $148,000,000 . <P> In answer , Inco denied that it was a monopoly . It said that nickel prices were so low that the U.S. Government had to subsidize Cuban mines during the war to enable them to compete with Inco . This seemed to sharpen Justice 's point that Inco owns all economically workable nickel deposits in the Western Hemisphere . Submarginal mines such as Cuba 's can compete only with subsidies . <P> If Justice wins its suit , Inco will have to divest itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two companies .
