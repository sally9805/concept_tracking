Like widening ripples , the effects of U.S. Steel Corp . ' s $25 million price cut last week splashed through the industry . One after another , Youngstown Sheet &; Tube Co. , Bethlehem Steel Corp . and Jones &; Laughlin announced price cuts from $1 to $5 a ton , even though first-quarter profits were down . ( Big Steel 's were down to $33,957,341 v. $39,234,511 last year . ) Republic Steel Corp. , third biggest steelmaker , was studying prices , had not yet acted . In all , the nation 's steel bill had been cut about $80 million a year , not quite what it had been boosted two months ago ( TIME , March 1 ) . <P> Would the cuts be passed on to consumers ? There were no signs of it , especially in the auto industry , biggest steel user . The recent increase in freight rates had more than canceled out the savings in steel . So some automobile prices were still rising . ( Last week the Ford Motor Co. upped the price of its new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) <P> Stone Wall . In turning down the C.I.O. steelworkers ' demands for a third round of wage increases , the steelmakers had plenty of company . Last week several other major industries , including Chrysler , General Motors and General Electric , stood firm with the steelmen in refusing union third-round demands . <P> Management was determined to hold down wages , chiefly because it feared that it could no longer pass along such boosts to price-conscious consumers . Result : the third-round drive has made little progress to date . For the C.I.O. , the hard-boiled meat-packers union had carried the ball-and run into a stone wall . After seven weeks of striking against Armour , Wilson , Swift and others , meat production was back up to 80% of normal . <P> Bulldozer ? Last week in Wall Street , union labor took another walloping . The A.F.L. 's striking financial workers went back to work in the Stock Exchange for the same raises ( $3 to $5 a week ) they had been offered before they struck-and little else . In addition , 100 found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up efficiency during the strike , found they were no longer necessary . <P> Though slowed , the third round was far from stopped . The C.I.O. 's auto workers last week voted to strike at Chrysler May 12 and started taking a strike vote at General Motors ' plants . The United Electrical Workers were threatening to strike General Electric , Westinghouse , and G.M. 's electrical division . Three railroad brotherhoods had called a strike for May 11 against 132 major railroads . And John L. Lewis notified the mine owners that after June 30 ( when their contracts expire and the union may legally strike ) , he wants something better . It looked as if the showdown on the third round was at hand .
