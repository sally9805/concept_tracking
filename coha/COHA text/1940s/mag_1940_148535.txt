How TO READ A BOOK-Morfimer J. <P> Adler-Simon and Schuster ( $2.50 ) . <P> Mortimer Jerome Adler never graduated from high school . He never got a B.A. degree . In 1917 , when he was 15 , he quit high school in Manhattan because the principal had taken pardonable annoyance at Adler 's efforts to run the school as well as the school paper . After two years on the New York Sun , Adler went to Columbia , finished the four-year course in three as top man in his class . At that time a graduate of Columbia had to be able to swim . Adler neither swam nor learned to swim . He got no degree until he had taught at Columbia for six years , finally taking a Ph.D . in Psychology in 1929 . <P> When President Robert Hutchins brought him to the University of Chicago in 1930 , Mortimer Adler was a very , very bright young man of 28 . At first Hutchins put him in the Philosophy faculty , where his colleagues soon proved ungrateful for his presence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professor of Law and co-teacher with Hutchins of the famous course in Philosophy of Education ( reading and discussion of great books ) , as a writer of philosophic essays respectful of St. Thomas Aquinas , Adler became one of the most scintillating , least adored , thinkers in the U. S. How to Read a Book should establish him as one of the most persuasive . <P> Long-nosed , lustrous Professor Adler wrote it in 16 days last summer , a chapter a day . ( Each night he went to a movie , taking in 16 movies . ) It is not a slight book ( 371 pages ) , but it is the first of Adler 's writings in which he has spoken expressly to the man in the street . For people who think they know how to read , he has a clarifying question : " What things would you do by yourself if your life depended on understanding something readable which at first perusal left you somewhat in the dark ? " After pondering that one , most honest readers will follow the argument that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than merely for entertainment or information , is a complex skill ; 2 ) U. S. schools and colleges no longer give as much time to developing it as they once did ; 3 ) it is extremely desirable , especially in a democracy , since all communication depends on it ; 4 ) it can be learned or improved by following certain practical rules . <P> This sensible thesis is given by Adler with almost stainless clarity and with only an occasional glitter of that acerbity by which dull students at Chicago remember him . Adler admits that he has an ulterior motive : to appeal over the heads of conventional and progressive educators to the great reading public , to , show them what education might be and " is not . Putting first things first , competence in reading is a prerequisite to understanding nine-tenths of what men have known .
