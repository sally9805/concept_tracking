The preliminaries were done with . Last week the 80th Congress humped to its work . Floor dockets were light , but committees ground away furiously . Besides ERP , two matters got special attention . <P> One was taxes . Minnesota 's dogged Harold Knutson was determined to get fast action on his bill to save taxpayers an estimated $5.6 billion . As chairman of the House Ways &; Means Committee , Republican Knutson meant to give short shrift to an Administration bill calling for 1 ) a flat $40 across-the-board cut in income taxes , and 2 ) a revenue-balancing reinstatement of the wartime tax on excess corporate profits . Even among Democrats , the Administration bill found few enthusiasts . North Carolina 's tough old " Muley " Doughton , ranking Democrat on the Knutson committee , refused to introduce it . To get this futile chore done , the White House had to go all the way down to the committee 's No. 3 Democrat , John Dingell of Michigan . <P> But Chairman Knutson bumped into an unexpected obstacle . Treasury Secretary John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congressmen , belligerently denounced the Knutson bill as inflationary , deficit-producing and , in short , " a major threat to the nation 's financial integrity . " Chairman Knutson reacted by subjecting his witness to a day-Jong badgering . Other Republicans were quick to realize that John Snyder was broadening a hint already made by the President : the Knutson bill , as it stood , would be vetoed . Good &; scared , they began to talk of bringing the tax slash down to around $4 billion . At week 's end , tax-wise Muley Doughton conceded that such a modification might well pick up enough Democratic votes to override a veto . <P> At another committee hearing , special attention was paid to the economic plight of U.S. postmen . Before a Senate Civil Service subcommittee appeared beauteous Mrs. Jeanne Bolen , mother of three and wife of a Washington letter carrier . In a few brief minutes of testimony , she showed the Senators what inflation is doing to all people on fixed salaries . She reported that even though she does all her own housework , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her husband 's work shoes , but nothing for recreation or emergencies . Yet Mr. Bolen makes only $3,100 a year . Added Mrs. Bolen : " One of the boys asked for a pound of butter for Christmas . He did n't get it . "
