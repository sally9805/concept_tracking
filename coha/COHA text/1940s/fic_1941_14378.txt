MUSIC RESUMES , BUILDS QUICKLY TO CRASH AND OUT . MEREDITH This is Burgess Meredith speaking for The Free Company . This afternoon we hear andwith andin a new radio play by Paul Green , author of . Mr. Green 's play is them a series produced by The Free Company , a group of promi- nent writers , actors and radio workers who have organized to give expression to their faith in American democracy . Some of these Free Company plays will deal with one or more of the basic freedoms assured all citizens in the Bill of Rights . These rights , hardwon through generations of man 's long struggle to be free , are fundamental to our American democracy . But if they are simply civil rights and nothing more they will not be enough to preserve that democracy . For democracy is a spirit not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And if that spirit is lost neither laws nor civil rights will save us . Today , for example , Mr. Green shows us a theme where no legal rights of a certain old colored man are violated , but where an attitude toward him and his race works against him and against his loyal , hopeful little son just as much as though his rights had been destroyed under the law . p. 3 MUSIC A HARMONIOUS NEGRO WOMEN 'S FOUR-PART CHORUS ( NO MEN 'S VOICES ) BEGINS HUMMING " THE BLIND MAN STOOD ON THE ROAD AND CRIED "  --  SWELLING IN AND THEN SLOWLY FADING UNDER MEREDITH ( RESUMING ) For our play today let us imagine the setting to be in and around a great American University .
