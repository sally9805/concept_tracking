txt By a vote of 75 to 2 the Senate gave final approval today to legislation which would give to producers of wheat , corn , cotton , tobacco and rice government loans up to 85 per cent of parity prices . The conference report on the bill was approved , 275 to 63 , by the House yesterday and the measure now goes to the President . The bill seeks to give to raisers of these crops a purchasing power equivalent to the value of such crops in terms of non-farm commodities which existed during the fiveyear period from August , 1909 , to July , 1914 , which is considered normal . At the present time the bill would not affect growers of tobacco and rice , since these crops are at or above parity prices . Some farm Senators indicated today that if President Roosevelt approved the authorization bill they would be inclined to ease their pressure for a $450,000,000 item in the uncompleted Agricultural Department Appropriation Bill for direct parity payments on these crops . This bill , carrying a total of $1,340,000,000 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Democrat of Georgia , said the conferees would not be convened until the President indicated his attitude on the loan measure .

The House added the other products and on the floor of the Senate these provisions were further extended . As the Senate took up the conference report today Senator Russell voiced hope that it would give to producers of these five crops full parity this year . This apparently was based on the fact that present market prices of corn , wheat and cotton are close to the proposed government loan rates . Senator Charles L. of Oregon asked Senator John H. Bankhead of Alabama , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would materially increase consumer prices on farm products . Mr. Bankhead said reports that the result would be a consumer price raise on the products affected of as much as 20 per cent were " wild , extreme and reckless . " Senator Carl C. Hatch , Democrat of New Mexico , asserted such a report had been made by the Department of Agriculture . " The raw cotton in this $2 shirt , " Mr. Baukhead replied , referring to the one he was wearing , " cost 1% cents . If the price of raw cotton was increased to 3 cents the shirt still probably would sell for $2 . " Senators Peter G. Gerry , Democrat of Rhode Island , and John A. // Danaher , Republican of Connecticut , cast the only votes against the conference report .
