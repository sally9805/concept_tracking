txt State tax revenues for the current fiscal year are running $80,000,000 to $100 , - 000,000 above the estimates on which this year 's State budget is based . according to the latest report of the State Tax Commission , released today . Normally this excess would flow into the two tax stabilization funds set up by the Legislature in the 1946 budget bills but because of emergency conditions a substantial part may be used to provide pay increases for teachers and State employes , according to legislative leaders . Part will also be used , under the terms of an agreement reached by Controller Frank C. Moore with representatives of State employes who served in the armed forces , to relieve veterans of the necessity of making pension fund contributions for the time they spent in service in World War II . Receipts Very Heavy The prospective excess of revenues over estimates is due principally to unexpectedly heavy receipts from the unincorporated business , bank franchise and motor fuel taxes . Receipts so far for the fiscal year that started April 1 indicate that total revenues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 25 per cent reductions in corporate franchise and unincorporated business taxes and the additional 25 per cent cut in personal income levies approved by the Legislature this year . In the first six months of the fiscal year gasoline tax revenue amounted to $37,000,000 , against an estimate of $60,000,000 for the entire year and receipts last year of $54,000,000 . Collections for the last six months are now estimated at $35,000,000 , making the total for the year $12,000,000 above the estimate . Receipts from the bank tax for the first six months were more than double last year 's net from this source , due partly to the fact that refunds on account of the amortization of premiums paid on the purchase of bonds have been smaller this year than last . Returns from the tax on unincorporated business during the current year have been running ahead of last year 's totals despite the 25 per cent cut in the tax rate voted this year . Tax experts credit this situation to the fact that a number of new small business enterprises sprang into existence immediately following the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to convert to civilian production faster than corporate rivals . Another factor responsible for holding up the volume of revenue from this tax was the fact that a number of service businesses that had been almost dormant during the war experienced a sharp revival with the end of hostilities . Corporate franchise receipts , reflecting the 25 per cent rate cut , are falling behind last year 's volume . Personal income tax payments are also behind but not to the full extent of the additional 25 per cent cut in rates . Liquor tax receipts are about meeting estimates but the cigarette tax yield is running ahead . Teachers ' Pay a Problem With hearings scheduled to start next Friday on the request of teacher organizations for additional State aid to education to finance pay increases , State officials decline to speculate on the amount of the excess of receipts over estimates that may be used for that purpose . There is a general understanding , however , that some of the excess will be so used . Legislative leaders familiar with State revenues pointed out that it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some teacher groups for a doubling of State aid to education without increasing taxes . The amount carried in the current budget for State aid to education is about $126,000,000 . In view of other commitments , it appeared doubtful that even as much as half the excess could be voted for teacher pay increases . The new health program voted by the Legislature does not go into full effect until this year It involves $11,000,000 to $14,000,000 in additional payments out of the State treasury annually . Payment by the State of pension contributions due from veteran employes on account of their wartime service has been estimated to involve another $7,000,000 or more . State payroll charges also will be increased as a result of putting into effect a thirty-five-hour , fiveday week for State employes with overtime after forty hours . Besides these prospective liabilities , the special education committee recently named by Governor Dewey to consider the possibility of using some State funds for teacher pay rises is expected to take into account prospective reductions in tax yields as abnormal conditions subside in arriving at the additional amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The committee consists of Charles D. Breitel , counsel to the Governor ; John Burton , Director of the Budget ; Speaker Oswald D. Heck of the Assembly , Senator Benjamin F. Feinberg , president pro , tern of the Senate , and Dr. Francis T. Spaulding , State Commissioner of Education . Besides the adequacy of teacher pay scales , this committee also will consider the use to which the additional State aid provided by the 1945 revision of the Friedsam formula is being put , the need for and desirability of new minimum wage legislation for teachers , the basis of State and local participa-. tion in the cost of common school education and the sources of revenue available for support of the common schools .
