On Detroit 's tree-shaded Grand Boulevard stands Henry Ford 's own hospital , famed for its skillful surgeons , its spacious research laboratories . But when ailing Edsel Bryant Ford stepped through its doors seven weeks ago with his quick , springy stride , nothing could be done for him . So , at 49 , Edsel Ford returned to his sprawling grey stone house beside grey Lake St. Clair to await death . Last week it came . <P> Seven weeks is not long to condition the greatest private industrial empire in the world for the loss of its titular head . But there had been more time than that . When Edsel Ford underwent a major operation 16 months ago , he must have known his days were numbered . But were even 16 months time enough to adjust the empire to the shock ? * <P> Only one man could finally answer that question-and he was tight-lipped with grief . But there are few problems Henry Ford has not foreseen . Wall Street , which Henry Ford hates obsessively , rubbed its hands at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sold to the public in order to pay astronomical inheritance taxes . But Wall Street rubbed its hands too soon . <P> The Problem . Of the 3,452,800 shares of $5 par value stock of Ford Motor Co. , Edsel held 41.65% , his mother held slightly more than 3% . Henry Ford held the remainder , in iron control of the company , which is valued at $718,000,000. * If this valuation were accepted by the Federal Government for tax purposes ( though it might be higher or lower ) the tax on Edsel 's holdings could be roughly computed at 75% , or $225,000,000 . The plain fact is that there may be enough liquid assets in the Ford empire to pay even this enormous tax . In December 1941 , the Ford Motor Co. set liquid assets , cash , bonds , etc. at $230,580,916 . This money could be used for taxes if it were loaned to Edsel 's estate , used to purchase Edsel 's holdings or distributed in dividends . But any such method would leave the Ford empire short of cash . <P> One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been found to avoid paying the staggering inheritance taxes ? <P> Set up with fanfare in 1936 was the Ford Educational and Charity Foundation . Into it both Henry and Edsel dumped blocks of nonvoting Ford stock . + The Foundation was ostensibly organized to finance Greenfield Village . Henry Ford Hospital and various other philanthropic projects . <P> The Solution ? If Edsel 's holdings of nonvoting Ford stock have been-or are to be-transferred to the charitable Ford Foundation to " help people to help themselves , " both the inheritance handed down to Edsel Ford 's heirs and the estate taxes would be much reduced . Only the shares retained would be taxable . True , millions upon millions would pass forever from the Ford family . But the family has always regarded money as only a handy tool . Control of the empire is what matters . To keep control , the loss of hundreds of millions would be considered a fair trade . <P> But in the shock of Edsel 's death , the plight of the empire will still be critical . It may not stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is 61 years ; Henry Ford is 79.
