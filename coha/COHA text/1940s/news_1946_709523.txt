Referring to your Central Park an title in the Topics of The Times anc repeating the statement that Nevi Yorkers are very , very lucky to havE Central Park , it may be timely to reel to the public attitude when the establishment of the park was under consideration in 1853 . As usual , there were objections among which was one to the effect that the park was planned for Uri " upper ten " who ride in fine carriages On the other hand , it was asserted that the wealthy and refined would protest that it would be " usurped by rowdies and low people .

TO THE EDITOR , OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Score one and a large one for your Anne O'Hare McCormick and her early recognition of the splendid qualities of high leadership of Georges Bidault , head of the French Resistance and of the M. R. P. The smashing success of his party in Sunday 's elections proves the correctness of her judgment . Also and immediately score a glorious victory for the liberty-loving people of France who have recognized the slightly diluted form of communism . Maurice Thorez and Jacques Duclos had concocted for them and have steadfastly stood for our way of life . Our authorities seem to have been a little less happy in their choice , in that they seem to have put their money on the Socialist horse , which finished a poor third . But whatever our Government may have guessed as to the future dominant party in France , the people of that country have unmistakably indicated the political trend there and what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say if you spoke to them , " of the old crabs . " Regardless of the Communist effort heavily backed by Moscow , the success of the new M. R. P. group , born of the trials of the Resistance , establishes clearly that the younger groups desire only to get away from that revolving-door political past . Our Government has done well in extending help to France . She needs it and we will one day need her help and that of all countries who think politically as she and we do . Only in boldly making clear to the gentlemen of the Kremlin our unshakable devotion to the system of free enterprise and our fervent attachment to the liberties of the individual , as the French elections and trends must serve to do , can we disabuse their minds of certain false hopes . Life in France and everywhere on the Continent is and has been grim . Hungry human are easy prey to the Soviet preachings of the success of their social experiment , sowing their seeds in the present discontent of millions . Let us continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ securing her safe frontiers . Gambetta once said : " France has fallen , but help her to her feet and she will be great again . " If we are to keep faith with our way of life and pass it onto our children we shall need her and wish to stand with her . The future will repay our present investment a thousandfold . RICHARD J. CRONAN . New York , June 4 , 1946 . D. A. R. Editorial Commended To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : We are writing to commend your editorial of May 24 criticizing the D. A. R. for their stand against the proposal to allow Constitution Hall , which they own , in Washington , to be used by gifted Negro and Oriental artists instead of being restricted to whites only . Your editorial comment goes straight to the point , but it seems to us that you could well have gone further . In demanding the immediate disbanding of the group within the D. A. R. formed to combat the ban on Negro artists the D. A. R. members became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Surely members of an organization should have a right to try to change the policy of their organization , unless it is a completely totalitarian group . Finally , we think you should have given editorial support to the proposal to withdraw tax exemption from the D. A. R. 's Constitution Hall as long as the ban on all other artists but whites is maintained . ALFRED BAKER LEWIS , FRANK R. CROSSWAITH , Negro Labor Committee . New York , May 29 , 1946 . Meat Black Market Situation To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Paul Porter 's letter of May 28 would indicate to the layman that the volume of black market meat has been greatly exaggerated . In the first place , let me say that quoting figures of Federal inspection of beef is no indication of the amount of beef that has been slaughtered by the " old-line packers . " Federal beef ? inspection is a testimony of sanitary slaughtering conditions but no proof of honesty . As a matter of fact , the majority of black market beef is Federally inspected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consuming areas . It is relatively easy for officials to detect and apprehend any meat that is not produced under Federal inspection and brought into such areas . The fact that the majority of meat sold in the black market is inspected is no reflection on the " old-line packer " or , for that matter , on any inspected slaughterer . It is principally due to the fact that the Government has issued thousands of slaughtering permits enabling individuals who have no facilities of their own to have meat custom slaughtered in inspected establishments . Those who have beef custom slaughtered for them in some instances have legal-price privileges , such as higher ceilings , which enable them to have this service performed , or as it pertains to the black market they pay no attention to price ceilings . The number of inspected slaughterers has been further augmented through the war by issuance of a great number of temporary inspection licenses on the part of the Department of Agriculture . Mr. Porter 's premise in quoting overall inspection figures is therefore unsound .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
