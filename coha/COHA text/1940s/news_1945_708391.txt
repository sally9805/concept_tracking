txt Ordway Tead , Chairman of the Board of Higher Education , in THE NEW YORK TIMES of Jan. 26 asked for " State Help for City Colleges , " but it seems to be unwise to give control of the city colleges to the State for a contribution of $1,500,000 . The power of the State to earmark funds connotes the power to control . The city colleges are neither State teacher colleges nor teacher training institutions . The teacher training feature of the city colleges is less than one-fourth of the college activity . It seems that this small proportion of college activity will dominate the whole policy if the $1,500,000 is forthcoming . In the revision of the Friedsam formula for State aid which will be considered under Governor Dewey 's educational program , the Board of Higher Education , an integral part of the educational system of the city , should receive due recognition . College Teacher Training In so far as the State supports a program for training teachers for elementary and secondary schools , there should he an institutional system for training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city colleges could serve as a training field for future college teachers under the Board of Higher Edudation as well as for teachers in the State teacher colleges . At the present time the rank of tutor in the city colleges is elusive . The compensation is so substandard that payment for the graduate requirement for promotion to the rank of instructor is almost impossible . If the State subsidized tutor college service through a scholarship fund of an annual minimum of $2,500 and permitted a reduced college teaching program with the directive that part of the scholarship money be apportioned to pay for graduate school fees , a constant reservoir of college teachers would be available to carry on the standards and ideals of our educational system in the college areas of public instruction . Question of Vocation This may be a better basis for asking State help without the attachments of State control than that $1,500,000 should be granted to the city colleges . There is another avenue for educational funds , if the State rejects the appeal for $1,500,000 . The city colleges train teachers of French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train pupils for interpreting and censoring mail , etc . This is vocational training . There are grants of money emanating from the Smith-Hughes Federal Act of 1917 for training teachers of vocational education . The Federal Bureau of Education does not seek to control State education in its distribution of money for vocational education other than by using a matching principle of a Federal dollar for a State dollar . Without any attachments of State control , the Board of Higher Education should be able to prove its training of teachers in vocational education in its language departments in order to permit Federal funds for education to prevail . Your editorial of . Ian . 17 " Allied War Aims " expresses the hope that the coming meeting of the Big Three will permit the announcement of more specific conditions which will be imposed on Germany . Doubtless the President has been unwilling to speak until he could agree on policies acceptable to our allies . But conflicting views of officials in this country also contribute to the uncertainty . It is difficult to escape the conclusion that the Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demands . THE TIMES ' general views on economic and political policies , as exemplified , for instance , by the editorial in the same issue , " Gustav Cassels ' Warning , " are frequently and forcefully expressed . But I do not recall having seen any explanation of how these policies are to be applied to Germany . I am sure you believe that one of the conditions which should be imposed upon Germany is a free economy in so far as this can be applied . It is , if I may say so , your job to describe in greater detail how it could be imposed and what constructive benefits would flow from it . Certainly , with France and other countries turning more and more to " controlled " economy , every possible effort must be made to enlarge the free area of the world . 1 am sure you believe it is essential that Germany , or whoever retains political jurisdiction over present German resources , should develop an understanding of and a solid interest in a free economy . Uncertain Americans should be convinced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that the elimination of import and exchange controls at the German border is the cornerstone of a constructive peace not only for Europe but for the rest of the world as well . We shall not get such war aims unless there is a more vocal public demand for them . PAUL ANDRESEN . Washington , Jan. 26 , 1945 . Liberty Bell May Be Duplicated TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEw YORK TIMES : May I point out to Edwin Hopkins , whose suggestion appeared in your issue of Jan. 24 , that Maj. W. Tudor Pole , the founder of The Big Ben Council , 19 Bell Moor , London , N. W. 3 , has already approached the Mayor of Philadelphia about a duplicate of the Liberty Bell made from the same molds - and by the same firm , the Whitechapel Bell Foundry , that cast the original Liberty Bell almost 200 years ago , and that duplicates of the new bell are under consideration . The editorial " White Pine , " in THE TIMES of Jan. 29 , was well done . The point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played in the development of this nation from a state of wilderness is both true and appropriate . There is one sentence , however , upon which your writer should he corrected . That is the final sentence of the second paragraph , " Other varieties of trees have superseded them as commercial timber . " The normal commercial production of white pine lumber in the Northeast is about one to one and one-half billion board feet a year . At the present time the production approximates that figure , although possibly not quite so great because of the general difficulties of production . Approximately 5 per cent of all the boxes and crates for aircraft parts , food and ammunition that are supplying our armed forces all over the world are made of the lower grades of Pinus strobus from the northeastern United States . The better grades make templates and pattern stock for guns , tanks , locomotives and other heavy war equipment . In peacetime the same Pinus strobus has been used , and will be again used , for boxes , crating , interior paneling , doors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white pine is still growing , and the wise lumbermen of the Northeast are looking ahead to the next generation and have been planning for years for the continuation of their operations . For example , one company has been in consecutive operation for seventy-eight years in the Saco River Valley of Maine , cutting white pine only . They can continue indefinitely by following their past practices . Another company is now in its seventh year of a ten-year cycle of cutting operations which have been planned to cut ten million feet each year then start in all over again and cut eight million feet for ten years . With normal care in logging and protecting the young growth , this particular operation can be on a continuous basis of an eight to ten million cut annually . The annual cut of white pine is quite small compared with Douglas fir , for example , but according to the United States Forest Service the northeastern section of the United States is the only region where annual forest growth exceeds the annual drain . Your tribute to the five-needled pine is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please also recognize that the time is not yet for eulogies to Pinus strobus , It is rapidly reproducing , growing and adding increment year by year and is serving its country today as it has for the past 300 years . Robert P. Patterson , Under-Secretary of War , is quoted in your issue 01 Jan. 26 as having said : " ' There are millions of people working in nonessential jobs . Yet our most critical programs are being delayed because we can not get a comparatively fewscorc thousand men . " He might have added that many of the workers he referred to are working forty hours a week , which means tWO whole holidays each week in what we are told is an all-out war . If any of our allies were doing this , would we not think it was fantastic ? A return to the forty-eight-hour week for all workers would go a long way toward solving the manpower shortage , as such an increase in working hours would increase production by 20 per cent and thus free 20 per cent of the workers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pungs on your editorial page led me to recall that in the Swedish language " pung " means a sack or bag . Thus , when on a recent business trip to Sweden I discovered that they have a little quip based on this word . The Swedes say that ' vat . Kreuger is still alive and is in hiding in China under the name Tom Peng Tung . The point is that those Chinese-looking words are Swedish for " empty money bag . "
