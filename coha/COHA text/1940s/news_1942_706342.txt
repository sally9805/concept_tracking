txt No Longer a Boy Sports writers are referring to Mel Ott as the " boy manager ! ' If my addition is correct , Ott is in the neighborhood of 32 years of age . John was younger when he took over the management of the Giants . Connie Mack also was younger than Ott when he began to manage big league teams . So was Bucky Harris of the Senators and so is Lou Boudreau of the Indians . Mel Ott is a fine ball player with a pleasing personality but he no longer can be called youthful with strict accuracy . Nevertheless , I hope that Colonel Bill Terry will watch the games from the clubhouse and that Ott will be nearsighted to the extent that he wo n't be able to see the instructions that will be waved to him . WILLIAM B. WIEGArcO . Newark , March 31 , 1942 . Editorial Note : The Brooklyn verdict is that Mel Ott should n't be managing a club like the Giants ; he 's old enough to know better .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
