The submachine gun never got a real hold in World War I , soon afterward began to figure more in gang news than in Army talk . Of 15,000 Thompsons ( " Tommies " ) manufactured by Colt in 1921 , nearly 5,000 were still unsold 18 years later . But World War II revised military opinion : the light , easily handled submachine gun ( spitting a stream of .45-calibre bullets 300-400 yards , battle sight-i.e. , point-blank range ) turned out to be a potent weapon in shock tactics . Recently Great Britain was reported eager to buy 250,000 to 500,000 from the U. S.-if they could be made fast enough . <P> Last week a new submachine gun that looked like the answer to the speed problem began coming in quantity from the Harrington &; Richardson Arms Co. plant at Worcester , Mass . The new gun weighs only six and a half pounds ( to the Tommy 's ten ) , fires 200 shots a minute . Its biggest feature : it has only three moving parts , is designed to be mass-produced at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the parts requires special machinery ; even the bolts could be made in carload lots by any first-class machine shop . Blurted an Army sergeant who fired the gun , " Good God , it 's so simple I could manufacture it myself . " Harrington &; Richardson bragged that it would produce 500 a day by next month , 1,000 a day by April . The U. S. Army made no commitments , but Army Ordnance predicted that the new gun " will play no small part in military events of the future . " <P> H. &; R. 's gun was invented by patient , reticent Eugene G. Reising , who started tinkering with firearms in boyhood and has been at it ever since . Gunsmith Reising has designed weapons for many of the big U. S. manufacturers , spent 16 years with Colt , holds some 60 patents and enough marksmanship medals to clutter his home at Hartford , Conn . <P> Reising worked out the details of his submachine gun at the H. &; R. plant , under a contract giving H. &; R. exclusive manufacturing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes that would complicate his gun . Then he groused : " Next thing they 'll be wanting me to put a shaving mug on it . "
