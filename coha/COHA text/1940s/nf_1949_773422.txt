txt // British lack of resistance was their record of 12 killed , 36 wounded and 477 captured . This , apparently , was satisfaction enough for the Kentuckians . The weather was beginning to grow unpleasantly cold . No provision had been made for feeding the army on an extended march through Canada . So , instead of going forward , Harrison retired with his army to Detroit . There he released the Kentuckians and sent them home . Harrison and the regulars shortly after boarded ships and sailed across Lake Eric to join forces with General McClure 's New York militia which were stationed on the Niagara front around Fort George . A campaign to drive the British from that area was contemplated . Meanwhile , however , Secretary of War Armstrong had centered his attention on Wilkinson 's campaign down the St. Lawrence against Montreal . Sackett 's Harbor was threatened and Harrison and his men were ordered there . Then Armstrong suggested to Harrison that , after his strenuous service in the field , the General might like to return home to visit his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Armstrong was indifferent to his services . Indeed the Secretary of War was of the opinion that Harrison 's military skill was greatly overrated . Another star was rising in the West in the person of Andrew Jackson ; and , between Harrison and Jackson , Armstrong preferred the latter . The Secretary took occasion to issue orders over Harrison 's head and inflicted other similar indignities that led to the General 's offer of his resignation . Acceptance would leave a single vacancy among the regular major generals . Acting in the absence of President Madison , Armstrong accepted Harrison 's offer and gave his commission to Jackson . Thus , at the very height of his career and while the laurels of victory were still fresh on his brow , Harrison retired from the military scene , not to return during the rest of the war . He was not to reappear before the public until many years later and then as a candidate for President of the United States . // Wilkinson in Quest of Laurels " To WHOM will you confide the charge of leading the flower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you find him in the person of an acquitted felon ? " At last John Randolph 's prophetic utterance before the Twelfth Congress was to come true . Perhaps , after all , the prophecy was not surprising for General James Wilkinson was a warrior of no mean distinction . Like Dearborn and Hull , he had seen active service in the Revolution . For a time he enjoyed the confidence of Washington , but his love of intrigue got the better of him . When he was discovered taking part with Conway in the cabal against the Commander he lost his position in the field . Wilkinson next assumed the office of Clothier-General to the army only to retire once more when serious shortages were found in his accounts . Nevertheless , after the war he was back again in the regular army , and as Federal commander in the Southwest he had the honor of raising the Stars and Stripes in New Orleans . In that same capacity he became involved in the conspiracy of Aaron Burr . It was rumored that Burr counted upon him to seize New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleared himself by appearing as chief witness against the Vice-President . He received a pension from the Spanish Government , presumably for services rendered , and his name appeared on the Spanish account books as " Spy No. 13 . " It is said that where there is smoke , there must be fire . Wherever Wilkinson happened to be there was always smoke , but it never quite burst into flame . He faced a Congressional court of inquiry and a court-martial , but so far as conviction was concerned he led a charmed life . " Not guilty " was invariably the verdict , though in 221 // one instance Madison accepted the decision of the court " with regret . " When it became apparent that old Henry Dearborn was no longer capable of commanding the army on the Canadian border Secretary Armstrong began to look about for a successor . There were two possibilities in the Southwest ; one was Wilkinson , the other Andrew Jackson . But Jackson 's military genius was then unknown . Besides , he too was suspected of connivance with Burr , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While Armstrong knew Jackson chiefly through the insults he had hurled at the administration , he was personally acquainted with Wilkinson with whom he had served in the Revolution . So it was that the invitation went to Wilkinson , who was none too keen to accept it , and not to Jackson , who was impatient to go . Had Jackson been selected by Armstrong in place of Wilkinson history might have contained a glorious chapter in place of one that records the shameful failure of American arms . So it was to Wilkinson in New Orleans that the Secretary of War wrote inquiring , " Why should you remain in your land of cypress when patriotism and ambition equally invite you to one where grows the laurel ? " An offer couched in such florid language could hardly be refused . The invitation went out in March ; but seldom has a commander proceeded more casually to his post . It took Wilkinson until July 31 to reach the national capital . He had the excuse of having been ill on the way . Wilkinson was another of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Washington Wilkinson lingered , conferring with Armstrong on plans for the contemplated campaign . Armstrong proposed first an attack on Kingston and then an expedition down the St. Lawrence against Montreal . This was not ambitious enough for Wilkinson , at least while he was still some thousand miles from the front enjoying the comparative comforts of Washington . He countered with a plan of his own . He would first drive the enemy from the peninsula between Lakes Erie , Ontario and the Niagara River . Having cleared that territory and , assuming that Harrison and Perry had failed in their mission , he would next proceed westward and reduce Fort Malden . With the peninsula and Upper Canada subjugated , it would be time enough to move on Montreal and deliver the coup de grace . Armstrong began to question whether he had // been wise in his choice of a commander . He put his foot down upon so extravagant and chimerical a proposal as a march on Malden and eliminated it from the field of operations , but stuck to the campaign against Montreal . Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready to depart for Sackett 's Harbor where he was to make his headquarters , no definite plan of action had been determined upon by the new leader and his chief in the War Department . ( See Map III , p. 156 ) With an astonishing lack of tact , and simultaneous with Wilkinson 's transfer , Armstrong shifted General Wade Hampton , of South Carolina , from the southern to the northern front to command the American troops on Lake Champlain . Hampton was a proud and wealthy planter who had seen service under Marion in the southern area during the Revolution . He knew Wilkinson , distrusted and detested him . Hampton was under the impression that his army of 4,000 men at Burlington , Vermont , was an independent command . But no sooner had Wilkinson reached Albany , New York , than he tried Hampton out by issuing an order to him . Hampton protested directly to Secretary Armstrong , refusing to take orders from Wilkinson and offering his resignation . Armstrong , however , prevailed upon him to remain at his post and hastened north @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between his two subordinates who seemed more interested in waging war against each other than against the British . Whatever the understanding may have been between Armstrong and Hampton , Wilkinson was determined to assert his authority . He reached his post at Sackett 's Harbor on August 20 and four days later dispatched a letter to Armstrong in which he cautioned him against meddling . " I trust , " he wrote , " you will not interfere with my arrangements , or give orders within the district of my command , but to myself , because it would impair my authority and distract the public service . Two heads on the same shoulders make a monster . " The campaign could not have got off to a worse start . Wilkinson 's command consisted nominally of from 12,000 to 14,000 men . Of these , 5,000 were at Sackett 's Harbor , 5,000 at Fort George on the Niagara ; and 4,000 , if they could be called Wilkinson 's , were with Hampton at Burlington . Sickness had been very prevalent on the Lakes during the summer so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the effective strength was not more than 9,000 . Wilkinson himself was soon added to the sick list and his reports began to take on the aspect of a hospital chart . " I dictate this under much depression of head and stomach , " he wrote Armstrong on September 11 . Five days later he was little improved . " I have escaped my palet , and with a giddy head and trembling hand will endeavor to scrawl you a few lines . " The season was already growing late , yet valuable days were wasted in lengthy discussions of plans between the Secretary of War and his obstinate lieutenant . Opposing the American forces , the British had in the field an army of 8,000 men spread out all the way from the Niagara Peninsula to Montreal , with Kingston as its center . It was finally agreed to abandon the attack on Kingston , Commodore Chauncey blockading the naval forces in that harbor , while Wilkinson should enter the St. Lawrence and set out toward Montreal . At the same time Hampton was ordered to set his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wilkinson on the St. Lawrence at the mouth of the Chateaugay River for the final assault upon Montreal . Troops were drawn from Fort George to swell the ranks at Sackett 's Harbor and Colonel Winfield Scott , who had been on the Niagara during the summer facing Vincent , was told that if Vincent left that front he might take more troops from Fort George and realize his ambition of having a part in the campaign against Montreal . While the final preparations were being made September sped by and it was not until October 12 that Wilkinson was ready to order a rendezvous at Grenadier Island where the waters of Lake Ontario enter the St. Lawrence . Five more days passed before the little army set out in scows , bateaux and sailboats accompanied by an inadequate number of pilots who knew the treacherous currents in that neighborhood . The day of departure could hardly have been worse . As the expedition put out into the lake a gale set in , attended by snow and sleet . In the ensuing darkness 15 of the large boats were lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was thrown into confusion . It was three days before the remnants of the expedition were collected together on the island , still in a disorganized and damaged condition . Wilkinson wrote courageously to his superior that , in // spite of this initial disaster , he would proceed to carry out his mission . The Commander needed all the courage he possessed , for the storms continued , battering the boats and creating intense suffering among the men . Finally the temperature dropped and the rain was followed by a snowfall of 10 inches . The fury of the elements added to all the other difficulties so that the reorganizing and reequipping of the expedition consumed two more weeks . At last , on November 5 , the army again embarked and entered the St. Lawrence River . Commodore Chauncey 's operations on Lake Ontario throughout the summer had proved quite ineffectual . He and Yeo , who commanded the British naval forces on the lake , had played hide and seek with each other and occasionally exchanged shots , but without bringing about a decisive action . Now that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gunboats to slip through and these immediately proceeded to harass Wilkinson from the rear . At the same time British troops from Kingston pursued the expedition by the road which followed the river along the Canadian shore and caused it further annoyance , taking pot shots at the boats whenever occasion offered . Unable to put up with this persistent pressure on his rear Wilkinson detached Colonel Alexander Macomb with 1,200 picked men and ordered him to clear the Canadian shore . Hearing that the British were being reinforced he sent General Jacob Brown with more men to support Macomb and , after that , General John P. Boyd with still more men to assist Macomb and Brown . November 10 found the expedition at the head of Longue Saute , a rapids eight miles long . Once the boats were in them there would be no way of getting out . To make matters worse news came that the British had seized a blockhouse at the foot of the rapids and were preparing to contest the passage of the Americans . Wilkinson dispatched General Brown down the river road to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were making things unpleasantly hot for him and , to cap the climax , the pilots refused to enter the rapids and run the risk of being caught in them during the night . There was nothing for Wilkinson to do but to moor his boats , take shelter for the night and await favorable news from Brown . The spot selected lay below an island known as Chrysler 's and opposite a farm of the same name . The night passed without incident and , early in the morning , the 225 // reliable Brown sent back the encouraging news that he had dislodged the British at the foot of the rapids . Wilkinson gave the order for the flotilla to move . But it was too late ; the British in his rear were already upon him . In this critical moment Wilkinson again fell ill . A note headed " From My Bed " was dispatched to Brown advising him of the situation and in it Wilkinson wailed , " It is now that I feel the heavy hand of disease ? enfeebled and confined to my bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the honor of our arms and the greatest interest of our country are at hazard . " Wilkinson roused himself enough to direct General Boyd to turn and outflank the enemy . Indeed , the situation had become unendurable and there was no chance of relief until the Americans stood and fought . Boyd took up a position with his left on the St. Lawrence , his right protected by a swamp and heavy woods . Opposite him on the Chrysler farm was the British line , protected by a heavy rail fence and ravines near the riverbank . In the St. Lawrence the American gunboats took up position to fend off any possible attack from the gunboats of the British . On the American right General Swartout was in command , on the left General Leonard Covington , mounted upon a snow-white charger . The day was cold and raw with flurries of snow and sleet , and the ground over which the battle was to be fought was a sea of slush . Yet the Americans proceeded gallantly to the attack . Swartout opened the engagement by charging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the main line . The fighting then became general . As the Americans moved forward they were met by a hail of shrapnel and bullets but kept stoutly on . In spite of the ravines , the fence and the mud , the cold that numbed their fingers so that they could with difficulty load their muskets , and the enemy fire that tore holes in their ranks , they succeeded in dislodging the British and driving them back a whole mile . But their temporary advantage had been gained at considerable cost . Covington on his white charger , gallantly leading his men , proved too good a target . He fell , mortally wounded . And , when the Americans needed it most , their ammunition gave out . There was nothing to do but retire over the ground they had just gained ; and the British , seeing them withdraw , set upon them with every- // thing they had in the way of shot and shell . When the Americans who were in the reserve observed their comrades retreating they fell into a panic and soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fortunately , at this moment a reinforcement of 600 men dispatched by Wilkinson reached the scene , and its arrival halted the rout . The battle of Chrysler 's Field ended with both armies facing each other , but neither daring to go forward . The American losses were heavy . They included 102 men killed and 137 missing as compared with a British loss of only 22 killed , 150 wounded and 15 missing . One account gives the forces engaged as from 1,600 to 1,700 Americans against 800 British ; another declares they were about even , including the Indian allies of the latter . The most serious loss of the Americans was General Covington , who died of his wounds shortly after the battle . In any event , it was not an engagement of which the Americans could feel proud , indicating as it did poor organization and incompetent leadership . Wilkinson in his report to Armstrong enlarged upon his physical handicaps . " The disease , " he wrote , " with which I was assailed on the 2nd of September , on my journey to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of convalescence , preyed on me ever since ; and at the moment of this action , I was confined to my bed , and emaciated almost to a skeleton , unable to sit on my horse , or to move ten paces without assistance . " The demonstration of Chrysler 's Field augured ill for success against Montreal . But then Wilkinson counted upon meeting Hampton down the river with fresh men and much-needed provisions . The following day the expedition proceeded unmolested through the rapids , joining General Brown and his detachment , which was waiting at the bottom . And there Wilkinson received the disappointing news that Hampton would not meet him . Wilkinson could not appeal to the Secretary of War to enforce the order , for the third member of this strange triumvirate had departed for home , leaving the other two members to settle their differences as best they could . Hampton , too , had been having his difficulties . He set out from Burlington for the Canadian border but ran into a drought which threatened to cut off the supply of water for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his route . He then found himself facing a British army . He attempted a flanking movement , but the troops as-227 // signed to the task lost themselves in a swamp and , when they came into conflict with a small detachment of the enemy , fled in dismay . The British were equally surprised and fled as rapidly in the opposite direction . After this unsatisfactory contact between two small detachments , the main bodies approached each other . The British , under Lieutenant Colonel De Salaberry , numbered 1,000 men ; Hampton 's force , 3,500 . De Salaberry , however , stationed his buglers at a considerable distance from each other and ordered them to sound off . Hampton , hearing the bugles so far apart , assumed that he was facing an army of immense proportions and , rather than sacrifice his command , gave the order to retreat . He did not halt until he reached a place called Chateaugay Four Corner from which he had set out and a considerable distance from the St. Lawrence . After these experiences Hampton was in no mood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Wilkinson to talk of Hampton supplying him with rations when Hampton himself was short of supplies . Besides , his personal animosity toward Wilkinson encouraged him to keep as far away from that gentleman as possible . So it was that Hampton 's adjutant appeared to report that the meeting was definitely off . So , too , was the campaign against Montreal . Wilkinson and his generals contented themselves with drawing up a paper condemning Hampton 's behavior . Armstrong presumably had not entertained the idea that an attack on Montreal by Wilkinson would be successfully carried out ; for , before his departure , he designated a site for winter quarters at French Mills , a few miles up the Salmon River . To this spot the dispirited army now repaired , suffering great hardship on the way and after they reached the camp . Wilkinson turned over the command to General Brown and set off for a place where he was much more at home than on the field of battle ? a hospital at Malone , not very far away . Wilkinson 's career was drawing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another expedition in the direction of the Canadian border , but it was brief and as disastrous as his first . After that he went home to face a court-martial where , as usual , his conduct was exonerated . Wade Hampton , too , gave up his command and retired to his broad acres in South Caro-228 // lina . Of the three bunglers Armstrong alone held on to resume his bungling in an even more conspicuous field . Throughout December and January Brown and the army remained at French Mills where they constructed rude huts that afforded little comfort . The cold was intense and the men were short of blankets . In the trip down the St. Lawrence most of the medicines and hospital stores had been lost and the nearest source of supply was Albany , a good 250 miles away . Provisions were scarce and of poor quality . And throughout the whole time the Americans were menaced by the enemy who gave them no peace . It was a great relief when at last in February orders were received to move . Through the snow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the forlorn army back to Sackett 's Harbor , from which it had set out so hopefully five months before . In that time all it had gained was bitter experience and the loss of a leader who never should have attempted to lead . Meanwhile disaster had struck the American cause on the Niagara front . It will be recalled that Colonel Winfield Scott was told that if Vincent left the Niagara he might take the 800 regulars at Fort George and join the expedition against Montreal . Vincent did leave , and so did Scott , though his men had to march by land and never reached Wilkinson . General McClure took over the command at Fort George but his force was now composed only of militia and volunteers and , as was usual with these soldiers in time of emergency , their enlistments were about to expire . Vincent 's abrupt departure was due to the fact that he had received news of the defeat of Proctor in the battle of the Thames and naturally assumed that Harrison would immediately follow up his victory by marching eastward and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sackett 's Harbor and on Lake Champlain . He therefore hastened by forced marches to Burlington Heights , at the western end of Lake Ontario , to intercept him . There he learned to his relief that , instead of advancing , Harrison had retired to Detroit . There being no further threat in that direction , Vincent retraced his steps to the Niagara to resume his harassment of the Americans . Vincent 's action placed McClure in a predicament , as the force under the latter was reduced and of poor quality . McClure deter-229 // mined to abandon Fort George and retire across the river and concentrate his men on the defense of Fort Niagara . In his alarm he seems to have lost his head for he not only attempted to blow up Fort George but , for no apparent reason , he set fire to the village of Newark , destroying all the houses and leaving the inhabitants without shelter in the bitter cold of the Canadian winter . His action was as strongly condemned by Americans as by Canadians but this did nothing to palliate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not long in coming . On December 18 the infuriated British took possession of Fort George and , in the night , crossed the river . A body of 1,000 men , including Indians , attacked Fort Niagara , which with criminal negligence had been left unguarded , captured the fort and deliberately slaughtered the greater part of the garrison . The raiders now swept up the American side of the river while another British force crossed at Queenston . The combined forces gained momentum as they went , bringing terror and destruction to Lewiston , Manchester , Schlosser and Tuscarora . At Black Rock they burned the Ariel , Little Belt , Chippawa and Trippe which had lain at anchor there since their part in the battle of Lake Erie . The raid ended with the plunder and destruction of Black Rock and Buffalo attended by the excesses that were customary when Indians had a hand in the game . The whole of upper New York was thrown into a state of terror and militia and volunteers were called out in a hurry to stem the tide . The British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Newark , retired as they had come , and left the border towns mourning their dead and the destruction of their property . During the year 1813 the American operations on land had met with complete failure , with the exception of the battle of the Thames . Yet the records of the Adjutant General 's office show that during the year the United States Army reached a total of 149,148 men , of whom 19,036 were regulars and 130,112 were militia . These figures are exclusive of volunteers and rangers . That would indicate a tremendous effort and a force far outnumbering any British force that could have been brought against it . Yet so short were the individual terms of enlistment and so widely distributed were the troops that never were more than a few thousand brought together // on a battlefield . As an example of the waste of man power , no fewer than 66,376 militiamen from Delaware , Maryland , Virginia , North Carolina and the District of Columbia were employed in observing no more than 2,600 regulars and sailors on British ships marauding in Chesapeake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well might the Federalists continue to declare that the Virginia Dynasty and its Southern and Western supporters had never intended Canada to be taken and that the failures were deliberate . // Jackson Justifies a Nickname THOUGH Tecumseh was dead and the Northwest subdued , the seeds of dissension he had sown in a distant country took root and produced distressing and bloody consequences . In northeast Alabama , where the Coosa and the Tallapoosa rivers join to form the Alabama , lay the center of the Creek country . The Creeks came under the classification of " good Indians . " Game in that region was scarce so that the Creeks perforce abandoned the chase for the plow . Besides , Colonel Benjamin Hawkins , the government 's Indian agent , was exceptional in that he was honest and had the interests of his charges at heart . ( See Map V ) The Creeks might have continued to live in peace and comparative serenity if they had not come under the spell of Tecumseh . Tecumseh 's mother was a Creek ; so when he went on his southern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was able to present himself as a kinsman . After the victory of the British and Indians at Detroit , in which Tecumseh played such a conspicuous role , the chieftain made a second visit to the Creek metropolis at the Hickory Ground , the peninsula above the confluence of the Coosa and the Tallapoosa . Along with him came his brother , the Prophet . Several thousand Creek warriors assembled to greet the distinguished visitors ; and , after Colonel Hawkins had tactfully left the meeting , Tecumseh and his retainers danced the war dance while the Prophet moved among his fellow medicine men doing missionary work . The purpose of the visit was to encourage the Creeks to combine forces with their northern brethren and present a united front to their white oppressors . The older warriors , content to let well enough alone , were cold to the proposal , but Tecumseh 's eloquence , his commanding pres-232 // ence and the knowledge of his glorious deeds in battle seized the imagination of the young men . The superhuman element also entered into the negotiations for the Prophet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearance of a comet was imminent , promised an omen from the sky . Tecumseh also warned the old warriors that if they did not accept his proposal they would hear the stamp of his foot when he returned to Canada . It happened that shortly after his departure an earthquake ? the worst Alabama had experienced in years ? occurred . These spiritual manifestations brought many hesitant warriors into line ; yet , in spite of them , so strong was Colonel Hawkins ' influence that many others held fast to their American allegiance . In fact the disaffected Creeks were estimated at not many more than 4,000 . And these were poorly armed . About 1,000 were equipped with guns of poor quality and uncertain mechanism . The guns could not always be trusted to go off and powder and shot were scarce . After the firing of the first volley the Creeks in their battles relied chiefly upon bows and arrows , and clubs . They could hardly be regarded as a formidable foe . Yet before they were through they achieved considerable success and created a diversion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have been employed to better advantage elsewhere . Tecumseh 's visit created unrest among the Creeks , culminating in numerous cases of lawlessness which greatly alarmed the white settlers on the frontier of the Creek country . These settlers appealed for protection to the Governor of the Mississippi Territory and to Brigadier General Thomas Flournoy , who had succeeded Wilkinson in command at New Orleans and Mobile when the latter went off in search of the laurels Secretary Armstrong held out to him on the northern scene . Flournoy , with the indifference so frequently encountered in officialdom , scouted the dangers , refused to act and quoted army orders and regulations to sustain his decision . Conspicuous among the Creek malcontents was Peter McQueen , a half-breed . Cruising in the Gulf of Mexico at this time was a British squadron , keeping in close contact with the Spaniards at Pensacola . To Pensacola went McQueen , heading a band of 350 warriors in quest of ammunition ; and to each man the Spanish Governor gave balls and powder . Not more than enough for a hunting expedition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of McQueen 's expedition , and , by now fully alarmed , determined to take matters into their own hands . They dispatched Colonel James Caller and a force of 180 mounted men to intercept the Indian party on its return . The two forces met at a spot called Burnt Cork Creek and the Indians had the advantage in a brief skirmish in which Caller lost two men killed and 18 wounded . Encouraged by this initial triumph , McQueen returned to Pensacola for more supplies and ammunition . Meanwhile General Flournoy had aroused himself sufficiently from his lethargy to order General Ferdinand L. Claiborne , a brother of the Governor of the Orleans Territory , into Mobile county where the white population was hastily constructing forts and gathering refugees from the countryside into them . Claiborne was all for going straight into the heart of the Creek country but was overruled by Flournoy . He then proposed calling out the militia . Flournoy replied that he lacked the necessary authority . So Claiborne had to be content to distribute his regulars among the forts , while the situation grew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Mims , on the Alabama River a short distance north of the Florida border , where over 500 persons ? wealthy half-breeds , whites and Negroes ? had taken refuge behind a stockade . To Fort Mims Claiborne sent Major Daniel Beasley with 175 volunteers and 16 regulars . Beasley entered upon his duties with greater zeal than good sense . He weakened his force by sending detachments of troopers to other forts and made reports to Claiborne in which he assured the general that Mims was perfectly secure . On a sultry summer day , August 29 , 1813 , two Negro slaves who had wandered outside the stockade rushed in ashen with terror to report that they had seen several dozen Indian braves in war paint within a short distance of the fort . Beasley sent out a reconnoitering expedition to investigate the story and , when it returned and reported having seen nothing , Beasley charged the Negroes with lying and ordered them lashed . The master of one of them objected . Beasley replied that he could either obey the order or leave the fort . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following day . August 30 dawned clear and oppressively hot . The morning passed uneventfully . The women were busy with preparations for 235 // dinner , as there were many mouths to feed . The young people amused themselves with dancing , children played innocently inside the stockade while the old people dozed or gossiped in the shade of the cabins . The only discordant note in the establishment was the sight of the Negro slaves bound to a post and waiting for their beating . But that was scarcely noticed , for the punishment of a slave was not unusual . Sentries walked their posts methodically , but without especial diligence . In spite of all the rumors , nothing really alarming had happened and perhaps the dangers had been exaggerated . While this carefree scene was being enacted in the fort , in the tall grass that waved not more than 400 yards away lay no fewer than 1,000 Creek warriors , armed and in war paint , waiting the signal to spring upon their unsuspecting victims . McQueen had now yielded his command to another half-breed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French , Spanish and Scottish blood . Weathersford might easily have passed as a white , as one of his brothers did , but he preferred the Indian life . A man of proud bearing , a superb horseman and distinguished for his courage , he compared favorably with the great Tecumseh himself . Noon arrived and the cooks had completed their task . A drum beat to summon the hungry garrison to dinner . That , too , was the chosen signal for the Creek warriors to leap to their feet and , with savage yells , to charge the fort . Major Beasley was among the first to hear the war whoops and take in the situation . He ran at top speed to close the gate to the stockade before the Indians reached it . But he was too late . Sand had drifted against it and while Beasley struggled to release it the Indians fell upon him and clubbed him to death . With Major Beasley dead , command of the fort fell to Captain Dixon Bailey , a half-breed , who proved equal to the occasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garrison to withstand the attack . The Indians swept into the first enclosure , cut two companies of soldiers to pieces and slaughtered the poor slaves where they stood strapped to the whipping post and but for whose unjust punishment the fort might have been saved . Before they could penetrate the second enclosure Bailey had organized his forces , which put up a stout resistance , the women of the garrison fighting side by side with the men . // For three hours the battle raged , the Indians letting loose a storm of arrows and endeavoring to find a vulnerable spot in the ranks of the defenders , the men of the fort holding them back with well-directed shots which took a heavy toll among the Indians . Bailey moved from place to place , encouraging his people , exhorting them to hold out and reminding them of the Indian practice of abandoning an attack after encountering stout resistance . Gradually the fierceness of the assault diminished and the Indians retired out of range . It looked as though Bailey had judged them correctly . But he failed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to come to the surface and he refused to admit defeat . Instead he rallied the warriors and persuaded them to renew the attack . The resistance of the whites centered around the Mims house which provided shelter for sharpshooters whose accuracy of fire was creating much havoc among the Indians . Weathersford now ordered his warriors to tip their arrows with fire and direct them at the houses . Soon every house inside the stockade was aflame and the people who had taken refuge in them , afraid to leave and expose themselves to the Indians , were roasted alive . Captain Bailey himself was severely wounded . When this disaster became known all resistance gave way . The Indians rushed the second enclosure and , brandishing their tomahawks and mad with the lust for blood , set to work upon the massacre of every white they could find . Men , women and children were indiscriminately slaughtered and soon the fort presented a spectacle of indescribable horror , the dead and dying strewn about everywhere in all stages of mutilation . Even Weathersford was shocked by the scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his warriors to end the unnecessary carnage but his appeals went unanswered . He was quite unable to control the force which he himself had unleashed . And so the work of murder went on . When , at last , the hot summer sun sank below the horizon not a white person remained alive . The Negroes were spared to be made the slaves of the victors . Of the 553 persons who , in the morning , had imagined that their presence inside the stockade and under the protection of the military made them safe from Indian attack , 400 now lay silent in death . One Negro woman in the heat of the battle escaped from the fort , 237 // found a canoe and paddled alone down the Alabama River to Fort Stoddard where she broke the news of the disaster to General Claiborne . Word of what had occurred at Fort Mims spread swiftly from mouth to mouth through Alabama and Mississippi , east to Georgia and north to Tennessee . And wherever it was heard a cry of vengeance went up . The Creek country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tennessee . Extermination of Weathersford 's band called for a march of 150 miles through a roadless wilderness from whichever direction an expedition might set out . From all three directions plans got under way . General Thomas Pinckney , of South Carolina , who commanded the Sixth Military District , comprising the Carolinas and Georgia , called out the militia and an expedition was organized under Georgia 's General John Floyd . From New Orleans Flournoy sent instructions to Claiborne to do whatever he deemed necessary . But to Tennessee was to fall the most conspicuous part in the reprisals , thanks to the initiative and driving power of her most distinguished citizen . From the outset of the war Andrew Jackson , planter , turfman and general of militia , had been impatient for active duty . Unfortunately , his tact was inferior to his military ardor . In Richmond , Virginia , during the trial of Aaron Burr , he delivered a speech on the street soundly berating Jefferson 's administration . He called Secretary of War Dearborn " an old granny . " When Jefferson chose Madison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the presidency and came out openly for Monroe . And , until he discovered the true nature of the man with whom he was dealing , he had been a friend of Aaron Burr and had unwittingly entertained him at his home . In consequence of these numerous indiscretions Jackson 's stock was not as high in Washington as it was in Tennessee . When he volunteered for service on the Canadian border his offer was politely ignored . A crisis in the South in the autumn of 1812 , however , afforded Jackson an opportunity . Britain and Spain were threatening Mobile and New Orleans , where Wilkinson was then in command , and the administration in Washington determined to settle the problem once and for all by marching into Florida and taking possession . The government thereupon asked Governor Blount of Tennessee for 1,500 militia to reinforce Wilkinson . Though he was aware of the strained // relations between the administration and Jackson , Blount took the bull by the horns and commissioned Jackson to lead the expedition . On December 10 , 1812 , Jackson assembled 2,000 men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever seen . On January 7 he embarked his infantry in flatboats lying in the Cumberland River and dispatched 670 cavalrymen under Colonel John Coffee by land direct to Natchez on the Mississippi . Jackson and the infantry put out down the stream and made the arduous journey of over 1,000 miles by way of the Cumberland , Ohio and Mississippi rivers to Natchez in 39 days , joining Coffee and the cavalry on February 15 . There he received a message from Wilkinson to stay where he was . The commander at New Orleans was far too shrewd a man to ignore the danger that lay in receiving to his bosom an ambitious military leader , 46 years of age . Meanwhile the situation altered in Washington . A stubborn Senate refused point-blank to support the administration in its designs on Florida and , consequently , all military plans had to be canceled . It devolved upon General Armstrong , but two days in office as Secretary of War and unfamiliar with the department 's details , to communicate with Jackson , thank him for his services and direct him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jackson assumed that the old animosity of the administration against him had been revived . How , he argued , could his men get back to their homes hundreds of miles away after they had been disbanded , without food or means of transportation ? He interpreted the order as nothing less than a shrewd scheme to get rid of him and , through necessity , to force his militia into the regular service . On the matter of shifting militia into the regular army Jackson was peculiarly sensitive . He was not the kind of man to accept defeat calmly . Without waiting for explanations of the order , he dispatched blistering letters to Washington and New Orleans telling his superiors in no uncertain terms just what he thought of them . Furthermore he made it known that he would arrest any Federal recruiting officer who dared set foot in his camp . He then addressed himself relentlessly to the task of collecting supplies and equipment to be used by his troops on the long march by the land route back to Tennessee , giving his personal notes for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 239 // government . Traveling at the rate of 18 miles a day the army of West Tennessee reached Nashville on May 18 , where Jackson dismissed it , confident that he had thwarted the administration in its clever scheme . It was not until then that he received a letter from Armstrong explaining the true reason for the cancellation of the original orders and also explaining that when he directed the disbanding of the army he had no idea that it was so far away from home . Where Armstrong was to blame was that after this episode he did not have the intuition to recognize that here was a military leader of astonishing resources and initiative ? something that was just then very much in demand as Wilkinson was making his tediously prolonged journey from the land of the cypress to that of the laurel . Jackson 's move to Natchez and return was not , however , altogether barren of results . It gave the General valuable experience in handling a large body of men on the march . And it was through his untiring efforts on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his men the nickname of " Old Hickory , " which was to stick with him all the rest of his days and stand as a perpetual memorial after his death . Events moved swiftly in Tennessee in those frontier times . Tennesseans were a proud people and their blood was hot . A chance word , a mistaken meaning and the friend of yesterday was the enemy of today . Jackson 's friend and lieutenant on the trip to Natchez was Colonel Thomas H. Benton . Yet a few weeks after their return to Nashville they were in an altercation ; Jackson attacked Benton with a horsewhip and Benton retaliated by plugging Jackson with lead , several bullets entering the General 's shoulder . So Jackson was in bed recovering from his wounds when news arrived of the massacre at Mims . The Tennessee Legislature acted promptly and authorized Governor Blount to call out 3,500 volunteers in addition to the 1,500 militiamen already in service . Too weak to mount a horse , Jackson dispatched Colonel Coffee with 500 dragoons to Huntsville , Alabama , below the Tennessee border , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above the line . He joined them there on October 7 . At the same time General John Cocke , with a division of 2,500 men recruited in East Tennessee , arrived at Knoxville. // It was one thing to mobilize an army , but quite another to feed it . The army contractors were inefficient , the Tennessee River by which Jackson had hoped to obtain supplies on barges from East Tennessee was too dry to serve for the transportation . From the very outset hunger became as dangerous an enemy as the hostile Creeks . For his 2,500 men and 1,300 horses Jackson figured that he needed each week 1,000 bushels of grain , 20 tons of meat , 1,000 gallons of whiskey and many other miscellaneous provisions that would have been hard to obtain in the city of Nashville , much less in so remote a place as Fayetteville . But Jackson was not to be discouraged from carrying out his plans by the shortage of provisions . He determined to live off the land and sent Colonel Coffee to forage , hoping that his supplies would eventually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack a small body of loyal Indians at a place called Ten Islands , some 50 miles away on the Coosa River , Jackson determined to go to the rescue . He set his men to work building a road through the mountain wilderness and established a post of supplies which he called Fort Deposit . On October 24 he set out from Fort Deposit with only two days ' supply of bread and six days ' supply of meat . Coffee went ahead of him , burned two Indian villages and brought in 300 bushels of corn . On the 29th Jackson arrived in the vicinity of Ten Islands and learned that the Creeks had assembled near by in a settlement named Tallassahatche . On November 3 he and his men reached the outskirts of the town and prepared for the attack . Jackson 's tactics were simple . They consisted of disposing his force in a semicircle , then sending a small body ahead to serve as bait for the Indians . As soon as the Indians attacked , the advance guard was directed to retire on the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the semicircle , the two ends were to come together and the Indians would find themselves surrounded and ready for unhurried and systematic slaughter . That was , of course , provided no part of Jackson 's line , upon seeing the Indians , turned tail and ran . At Tallassahatche the plan worked to perfection . The Indians took the bait , rushed pell-mell into the trap and the ends closed on them while the sides held firm . The bag on that occasion was 186 Indian braves killed outright at the cost of five Americans killed and 41 wounded . After this easy victory Jackson retired tri-241 // There was no telling what might have happened had not Colonel Coffee and a troop of loyal cavalry arrived on this strange scene where commander and men glared at each other across an intervening space of a few yards . Coffee 's appearance was sufficient to turn the tide . Silent and glum the men returned to their billets . Having won a moral victory Jackson at last decided to let those go who wished to leave and the majority seized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Governor Blount Jackson received an urgent appeal to return home himself , but Jackson refused . His expedition had failed thus far to crush the Creeks and he no longer had an army , yet Jackson was determined not to leave Strother . Instead , he urged the Governor to recruit a new army and send it to him , and he dispatched Cocke to Tennessee to speed the word . Such determination was all too rare among the commanding generals . Meanwhile the American forces to the east and south had not been idle . Brigadier General John Floyd with 950 Georgia militia invaded the Creek country from the east and , on November 29 , attacked the village of Auttose , 20 miles above the Hickory Ground , where the Creek warriors a short time before had listened to the exhortations of Tecumseh . Artillery and a bayonet charge combined were too much for the nerves of the Creek warriors . Floyd slaughtered 200 of them with the loss of only 11 killed and 54 wounded in his own force . But , like Jackson , he was handicapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following up his victory . He halted at Fort Mitchell on the Chattahooche River . General Claiborne , to the south , received orders from Flournoy to march to the heart of the Creek country , drive the Indians to the frontiers and " kill , burn and destroy all their negroes , horses , cattle and other property that can not conveniently be brought to a depot . " Claiborne set out and on December 3 reached Econochaca , Weathersford 's own town . At the cost of one man killed and six wounded he accounted for a modest 30 Indians , and burned the town . He almost captured the half-breed chief himself . In the course of the fight Weathersford found himself surrounded by Claiborne 's men as he sat on his horse on a high cliff above the river . Rather than suffer the humiliation of surrender , as the Americans approached Weathersford dug his heels into the ribs of his mount and horse and rider to- // gether plunged into the stream . Both came to the surface uninjured and made good their escape . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hopes as it had done Jackson 's . Within a month only 60 men remained on duty with him in the fort to which he had retired and which bore his own name . When the books were balanced at the close of the year 1813 the Creeks were on the credit , the United States on the debit side . More than 7,000 troops had been poured into the Indian country and in the course of the several expeditions 800 Creek warriors had been slaughtered . Yet , after six months ' effort , the seat of the trouble had not yet been reached and the principal malefactors remained at large . It could not be said that Fort Mims had been avenged or even that guarantees had been created against a similar occurrence . On the American side , however , there was one potent factor . The tall , iron-gray soldier with the piercing eye and the determined chin was still at Fort Strother . Jackson 's indomitable will had not been broken . The obstacles that had stood in his way had merely served to strengthen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administration in Washington , as he had already convinced his soldiers on the march back from Natchez , as to what sort of a man he was . Shortly after New Year 's there arrived at Strother 900 Tennesseans enlisted for 60 days ' service . Jackson was determined to make those 60 days count . On January 15 , hardly before the new men had had time to settle down to camp routine , he set out with them on a raid in the direction of the Tallapoosa River . Accompanying the expedition were 200 friendly Cherokees and Creeks and Colonel Coffee with 40 volunteer horsemen , all that remained of his command after the choice had been given the men of staying at Strother or going home . The expedition gained contact with the Indians near Emucfau and at Enotochopco Creek , and results were achieved as was customary where the American forces could get within striking distance . Some 189 Creeks were killed with a loss to Jackson 's force of 20 killed and 75 wounded . After this minor success Jackson withdrew to Strother . It had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Indians from a similar raid being made by General Floyd from the east . Floyd 's column struck on the Calebee River . As soon as the Americans attacked the Indians retired , leaving 37 dead be-245 // hind them , but in their retreat they took a somewhat costly toll of 17 Americans killed and 132 wounded . The losses served to dampen Floyd 's enthusiasm and , besides , his men were on short enlistments which were about to expire ; so he , too , withdrew his force . Unimportant as these various expeditions had been in bringing about a decision they taught Jackson that he could not lead a large body of men into the wilderness of central Alabama and count upon their living off the land . Arrangements had to be made for carrying provisions and maintaining supplies . He also learned that 60-day militia and volunteers were not dependable for a sustained campaign . By February 6 , thanks largely to the efforts of Governor Blount at home , Jackson had under his command a force of 5,000 men , including some friendly Choctaws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulars of the 39th U. S. Infantry . Jackson used them to brace his command and also to help him in instilling discipline among the recruits . Some of the Tennessee volunteers were not altogether satisfied with conditions as they found them at Strother and openly expressed their opinions . Jackson perceived that here were the seeds of the insubordination that had given him so much trouble a few months before and he had no intention of allowing them to germinate . When word came to him that General Cocke , who had returned to Strother , had addressed the malcontents in a manner that might be interpreted as sympathetic toward their complaints , Jackson , indifferent to Cocke 's high rank , relieved that officer of his sword and ordered him placed under arrest . A private willfully disobeyed an order . Jackson called a court-martial and , when the charges were proved , had the boy executed . It was harsh action and caused a stir in Tennessee . But , at Fort Strother , it put an abrupt end to all rumors of mutiny . With this housekeeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Word now reached Fort Strother that a force of 900 Creek warriors with 300 women and children had taken refuge on a peninsula made by a sharp bend in the Tallapoosa River known as Tohopeka , or the Horseshoe , and that they had fortified the position and were awaiting attack . The Horseshoe was protected on three sides by the river itself . In its front , and extending all the way across the peninsula , the Indians had erected a rampart of stout logs . // Jackson accepted the challenge and prepared to move against the Horseshoe . To insure adequate food supplies for his men he arranged for boats to pass down the Coosa River and he also set his men to work cutting a military road through the woods . At one point on this road he erected a fort . As soon as he was assured that his line of communications was intact he marched his men to within a few miles of the Horseshoe . It was now March 27 . Along the line of communications Jackson distributed troops to protect it so that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduced to about 2,000 men . This was more than twice the size of the Creek garrison ; but , on the other hand , the Indians were protected by fortifications . Having given the last instructions to his officers and inspected his men to see that they were adequately equipped with arms and ammunition , Jackson was ready to strike . Early on the morning of the 27th Colonel Coffee , his cavalry and some friendly Cherokees were ordered to cross the river above the Horseshoe and make their way to the rear of the Indian stronghold . Jackson waited until he received a message from Coffee announcing that this movement had been successfully accomplished . With Coffee in the rear of the fort and separated from it only by the river , Jackson ordered the main body to advance until it was within 80 yards of the ramparts . On a near-by hill , and commanding the fort , he placed two cannons , weapons the Indians most dreaded . At 10 A.M. the engagement commenced with artillery fire . Jackson hoped to blast a breach in the defenses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the heavy logs which reinforced the ramparts . However , while Jackson was engaging the Indians in front , the Cherokees with Coffee swam the river and made off with the canoes of the Creeks which lay in the river behind the fort . Two hundred of Coffee 's men embarked in the captured canoes , recrossed the river , set fire to the fort and attacked it from the rear . The defenders thus found themselves caught between two groups of assailants and were forced to weaken their front line in order to meet the threat in their rear . The battle had now raged for two hours and the Indians were desperately holding on to their position . At noon Jackson determined to decide the issue by storming the ramparts . For this bold task he se-247 // lected the 39th Infantry to lead the van , supported by a brigade from East Tennessee . When the order was given the regulars , their bayonets flashing in the sun , rushed forward with a shout , to be met by a storm of bullets and arrows fired by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wounded , but still the regulars pushed on . Major L. P. Montgomery , at the head of his men , was the first to reach the breastworks . He leaped onto them and shouted to his men to follow . As he did so a bullet pierced his brain and he fell to the ground dead . Thus , at the most critical moment of the battle , the 39th lost its leader , but a young ensign was on the spot to take over the command . He was a Virginian and his name , later to become famous , was Sam Houston . Houston himself had been wounded by a barbed arrow but , unmindful of his injury , he ordered his men to give the Indians the bayonet . The Creeks with their tomahawks and clubs were no match for the cold steel of the Americans wielded at close quarters . Some stood their ground bravely and were cut down , but the majority broke and fled . Some tried to swim the river and while they were in midstream became targets for the sharpshooters on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to obey Jackson 's command to come out and surrender . Ensign Houston was ordered to dislodge them but before he could carry out the command he received another wound which put him out of the battle . Then the torch was applied and the Indians were smoked out of their hiding place . The battle now degenerated into a slaughter . Throughout the rest of the afternoon the Americans occupied themselves rounding up and killing Indians and among them some of the squaws and children . Jackson expressed regret over the slaying of the noncombatants which , he said , was accidental . From the standpoint of the Indians the Horseshoe presented a tragic spectacle . On all sides lay the corpses of Indians . Nine hundred warriors had faced Jackson from behind the ramparts in the morning . As the sun went down in the evening the bodies of 550 were counted on the peninsula alone , not including those who had attempted unsuccessfully to escape by the river . Of the original 900 only 200 remained alive . Compared to the victory achieved the American losses were slight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 99 wounded ; the friendly Cherokees lost 18 killed and 36 wounded . // At last Jackson had made good his purpose . Fort Mims had been thoroughly avenged . Equally important was the fact that the Horseshoe was the decisive battle in the war with the Creeks . Some of the Indian ringleaders remained at large and sought protection from the Spanish and British at Pensacola , but the Creek nation had been crushed . Weathersford did not wait to be hunted down but voluntarily went to Jackson , who withdrew to the Hickory Ground after the battle , and surrendered , asking Jackson to do with him whatever he pleased . Jackson , who admired Weathersford 's courage , magnanimously forgave him . Weathersford walked out of the General 's tent a free man , and also out of history . He gave no trouble again . A deputation of Creeks , representing principally those who had remained loyal to the United States , appeared before Jackson to arrange terms of peace . The General had in his possession drastic articles of capitulation which had been prepared for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Since the loyal Indians were the only ones with whom Jackson could deal he applied the capitulations to them , a proceeding that only impressed them all the more with the strange ways of white men . The Creeks could do nothing but accept the terms which hemmed them in on all sides by the whites . The Creeks had at last been conquered , but the victory was hardly to the credit of the United States . For six months no more than 3,500 Creek warriors , incompletely equipped with guns and ammunition and dependent chiefly upon their bows and arrows , had defied no fewer than 15,000 American regulars , volunteers , and militia . It had cost the United States Government thousands of dollars for food , pay and equipment , not to mention the thousands of dollars that were to be paid out to the survivors and their widows after them over more than a hundred years . The victory , if it can be called one , really belonged to the British . For at the cost of a small quantity of powder and shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allies they had succeeded in distracting the attention of 15,000 troops that could have been put to more effective use elsewhere . // Glory , But Nothing More WHEN the Canadian campaign of 1813 closed with the failure of Wilkinson 's expedition to Montreal the forces on the northern frontier remained inactive throughout the rest of the winter and early spring , save for Wilkinson 's brief and desultory attack at La Colle . Upon Wilkinson 's departure for home the Army of the North was again in search of a commander . If Canada was to be conquered something had to be done and done quickly . In Europe , from the American standpoint , matters had gone from bad to worse . On March 31 , 1814 , the Allies entered Paris and the fall of the French Empire became a matter of days . This was of vital consequence to the American cause , for the government in Washington had been informed that , with the collapse of the Empire , fourteen more British regiments of Wellington 's veterans would be released for service in America and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by August at the latest . If the Americans could not achieve a victory over the limited forces already in Canada there was little hope of achieving it after the arrival of these reinforcements . It devolved upon Secretary Armstrong to select a new leader . William Henry Harrison , who showed considerable promise , was no longer in the running . Ignored by Armstrong after his victory at the Thames he had resigned his commission and quit the Army in disgust . Jackson was still occupied with his Creek campaign . But even if he had been free it is doubtful if Armstrong would have risked adding to Jackson 's prestige by moving him to the Canadian theater of the war . Armstrong 's choice for the post was the Quaker , General Jacob Brown . Under the circumstances , assuming the disqualification of 250 // Harrison and Jackson , the Secretary of War could not have made a better selection . Prior to 1812 Brown 's military experience had been limited to the militia . However , he had displayed rare courage and initiative in his defense of Sackett @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been uniformly good ; in fact , one of the few bright spots in that disastrous campaign . What Brown lacked in the arts of strategy and tactics was fully made up for by his zeal , and he enjoyed the confidence of his fellow officers and his men , which is more than could be said of Wilkinson . The selection of a commander accomplished , the next thing was to devise a plan of action . Armstrong first proposed the now-familiar scheme of attacking Kingston in conjunction with Commodore Chauncey 's squadron at Sackett 's Harbor , preceding it with a feint on the line of the Niagara River . But Armstrong 's wording of the order was so ambiguous that Brown assumed the main attack was to be made along the Niagara and lost considerable time marching his men back and forth before an understanding was reached . Eventually , however , Armstrong 's first plan was scrapped ; it was decided to ignore Kingston for the time being and concentrate on Niagara . ( See Map II , p. 110 ) Brown 's available force consisted of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulars , one under Brigadier General Winfield Scott , the other under Brigadier General Eleazar Ripley . Scott 's brigade was encamped at Buffalo and consisted of 65 officers and 1,312 men recruited from Massachusetts , Vermont , Pennsylvania and Connecticut . Ripley 's brigade , 36 officers and 992 men from Massachusetts and New York , was stationed at Black Rock , a few miles from Buffalo . Also under Brown was Brigadier General Peter B. Porter with a force of 600 militia volunteers from Pennsylvania and a detachment of friendly Seneca Indians . Artillery to the number of 15 officers and 330 men completed the army . The British at this time held Fort Niagara on the American shore at the mouth of the Niagara River , Fort George on the Canadian shore directly opposite , and Fort Erie on the Canadian shore overlooking Lake Erie , Black Rock and Buffalo . The British army confronting the Americans , and distributed among the three forts and in the towns of Queenston and Chippawa , was composed of 2,300 officers and men , including a detachment of Indians , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an Irish officer of questionable ability who was said to have bought his way to his distinguished rank . However , at Burlington Heights and York were reinforcements capable of increasing Riall 's force to 4,000 . According to the final plan Brown was first to cross the Niagara at its source , capture Fort Erie , sweep down the left bank of the river through Chippawa and Queenston and capture Fort George , recross the river and recapture Fort Niagara . At the mouth of the Niagara he was to be met by Chauncey 's squadron from Sackett 's Harbor and , protected by the fleet , march on Burlington Heights , thereby driving the British out of the whole of the peninsula between Lakes Erie and Ontario . But a British attack on Oswego , New York , destroyed American supplies and weakened Chauncey 's position at the harbor where he was virtually bottled up . It was an ambitious proposal . The United States had at last got together an army with more than a semblance of discipline and order . This time there was to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the field because the term of enlistment had expired . Scott , in particular , had not wasted the winter months in idleness but instead had devoted them to the serious purpose of whipping his brigade into shape . Report had it that he drilled his men regularly from eight to ten hours a day , so that they had become an efficient , hard-hitting force . There was , however , one serious drawback . Defenders of Ripley say that he was a gallant soldier but admit that he was cautious , a characteristic that was possessed by neither Brown nor Scott . This cautiousness kept him out of tune with his superior and his fellow brigadier . He was not long in displaying the fact that he was not in accord with the expedition and questioned the likelihood of its success . Certainly his reticence did not make success more likely . Brown selected July 3 for the attack on Fort Erie and gave orders for the army to embark before dawn in boats provided for the crossing . Scott 's brigade was to set out from Buffalo and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cross from Black Rock and attack below . But the order did not suit Ripley . He doubted that the fort could be taken and said so . Furthermore he supported his objections by tendering his resignation . Brown , perhaps // unwisely , refused to accept it and told Ripley to go ahead and execute the order . Pursuant to his instructions Scott crossed the river in the early morning darkness and when dawn broke his brigade was on Canadian soil drawn up in line of battle ready for the assault . Ripley , on the other hand , had not left the American shore . Nevertheless Brown attacked without the aid of Ripley who a few hours later made the crossing . As matters turned out Ripley 's dilatory behavior made no difference in the outcome , for Fort Erie proved to be poorly fortified and weakly garrisoned . After the exchange of a few shots the British officer in command raised a white flag and the defending force of less than 200 men walked out and were sent as prisoners back to Buffalo . The skirmish cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British lost one man killed . Meanwhile Brigadier General Riall , receiving word of the attack , hurried forward reinforcements composed of 1,500 regulars and 600 Indians and militia . These had reached Chippawa , a few miles distant , when they learned that Fort Erie had already been captured and there Riall halted to await eventualities . On the following day , the anniversary of Independence , Brown ordered Scott 's brigade and Captain Nathan Towson 's battery to advance in the direction of Chippawa . Scott drove in the British pickets and marched to Street 's Creek , about a mile from Chippawa , where he encamped for the night . He was joined at midnight by Ripley 's brigade and Major Hindman with the rest of the artillery . Brown 's army numbered in all 3,500 men exclusive of the Indians . The American and British forces were now not much more than a mile apart . Between them lay a plain about a mile wide , flanked on the east by the Niagara River and on the west by a dense wood . South of this plain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ served as a protection to the American army , and north of it was the Chippawa River behind which was the British camp . A road skirted the bank of the Niagara and two narrow bridges carried the road over Street 's Creek and the Chippawa River . The rapidity with which the contending forces approached each other was due more to accident than design . Aware of their nu-253 // merical superiority over the British the Americans did not dream that Riall would risk an engagement . Riall probably would not have done so if he had not been misled by one of his subordinates , the Marquis of Tweedale . It so happened that before the opening of the campaign Scott 's men were in need of new uniforms . The conventional color for regulars was blue but when Scott put in his requisition he was informed by the Quartermaster Department that the only cloth available was gray . Scott was not the sort of man to haggle over the color of uniforms when his men needed them so he instructed the quartermaster to make them up out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uniforms the brigade was wearing as it approached Street 's Creek . Thus it was that the Marquis of Tweedale , observing the advancing American column through his field glass , noted the unusual color of the uniforms and concluded that the troops must be militia . It did occur to him that they were displaying a boldness that was somewhat rare for militia but he attributed this to the probability that they had , as true patriots , been celebrating the national holiday and were fortified with Dutch courage . He therefore reported to Riall that there was nothing but militia on his front and Riall felt completely assured and did not order a retreat . At noon on July 5 Scott was reinforced by General Porter with his Pennsylvanians and Indians . About 4 P.M. he observed British troops in the woods and , assuming that they were some insignificant detachment , he ordered Porter to advance and disperse them . Porter at once set his men to the task and accomplished it so successfully that he drove the enemy all the way back to Chippawa , never dreaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It did not take him long to discover his mistake and , in a few minutes Porter , his Pennsylvanians and his gallant Seneca warriors were racing back to the American camp in complete rout with hardly enough breath left to report that the whole British army was upon them . Brown , who first received the news , notified Scott . It seems that the Marquis of Tweedale was about 24 hours off in his calculations on the celebration of Independence . For some reason that had tl been postponed until July 5 when the American troops partook of a hearty dinner . But , Independence or no Independence , Scott refused to let a holiday interrupt his disciplinary routine . He deter- // mined to make his men sweat out the food and drink they had just consumed and , at the very moment Brown 's message reached him , he was leading his brigade across the bridge over the creek and on to the plain for a grand parade and review , as he expressed it , " to keep them in breath . " In spite of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressed doubt that he would find more than a few hundred British on his front . However , he would drive them off and then proceed with the review . While these thoughts were passing through Scott 's mind Riall 's army was already advancing toward him in three columns across the plain . In a few seconds Riall 's artillery , planted beside Chippawa bridge , began to play unmercifully upon the American ranks , and then at last Scott realized that he had not a review but a battle on his hands . Undaunted by the unexpected turn of events Scott calmly ordered Major Thomas Jesup and the 25th Regiment to move toward the woods to protect his left flank . On his right flank , near the Niagara River , he posted his artillery to deliver an oblique fire at Riall 's advancing column . In the center he placed Major John McNeil and the 11th Regiment and Major Henry Leavenworth with the 9th . His dispositions were made none too soon , for as the Americans hastened to their positions the British infantry approached within effective range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then the full weight of Tweedale 's mistake made itself felt . No militia could have executed a difficult maneuver as swiftly as did Scott 's regulars after they had been taken by surprise . The long hours of drill throughout the winter upon which Scott had insisted proved their true worth in the test . The American line , instead of breaking as Riall expected it to do , held firm . As the battle raged , gaps began to show in the British ranks . Scott was quick to detect them and equally quick to take advantage of them . He picked out a point where he thought there was a good opportunity to drive a wedge . Then he indicated the spot to McNeil and Leavenworth and ordered them to charge . With a shout the men of the 11th and the 9th moved forward and attacked the enemy with bayonets . And there , within sound of the great falls of the Niagara , on that late summer afternoon , Americans and Britons met in hand-to-hand combat and fought it out . 255 // The issue was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the pressure of cold steel , then broke . And in another instant the Britons , who only a short time before had marched proudly and confidently on the plain , turned about and fled while the men of the 11th and 9th Regiments followed in hot pursuit . The chase did not end until the British pulled up in comparative safety behind the protecting waters of the Chippawa River . Jesup , on the left flank , was equally successful with his assignment . The British forces against him , seeing the disorder in the center , gave up the struggle and joined in the general rout . Ripley 's brigade at last arrived on the field , but too late to take part in the battle . Consequently the American force actually engaged was slightly smaller than the British . For the first time in the war British and American regulars had met on even terms and the Americans held possession of the field . It was a tribute to the American regular but it was even more a tribute to General Winfield Scott . As the battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and both armies were thoroughly drenched by the downpour and their ardor considerably cooled . Reconnoitering parties from the American ranks reported the British position behind the Chippawa too strong to be taken by assault , so Scott called it a day . As the storm passed over and the setting sun broke through the clouds in the west Scott 's triumphant army reached its camp by Street 's Creek . The rest of the evening was devoted to counting the dead and collecting the wounded . In the engagement the Americans lost 61 killed , 255 wounded and 19 missing ; the British , 236 killed , 320 wounded and 46 missing . The plain on which the battle had been fought lay deserted . And , in spite of the American victory , the armies remained in the same positions they had held before the battle commenced . Next day Brown ordered a bridge constructed over the Chippawa to the left of the British position in order to assault it on the flank . The job was assigned to Ripley but , as usual , he offered objections . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of harm 's way , past Queenston and westward up the peninsula in the direction of Burlington Heights . In his train followed Brown 's army but it held to the shore road until it came within sight of Fort George . There Brown halted and looked for the sails of Chauncey 's // fleet which he expected would meet him at the mouth of the Niagara . But no fleet was in view . The General sat down and composed a letter to Chauncey in which he pointed out that with the assistance of the fleet he was prepared to drive the British out of Upper Canada . In language more forceful than was customary in Quaker usage , which prefers affirmation to oath , he concluded , " For God 's sake , let me see you . " But Brown was not to see Chauncey , who usually managed to have a good excuse for doing nothing . The Commodore at that moment was ill in bed with a fever ; and , even if he had been in good health , he could have been of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harbor by the ships of Sir James Yeo . Chauncey was not long in advising Brown of the situation . In addition , the General received the equally discouraging news that Riall had been reinforced by Lieutenant General Gordon Drummond . Not only was Brown unable to follow up his victory at Chippawa , but his own army was in a critical position where it had halted . There was nothing he could do but retrace his steps . The retreat soon got under way , but not before Colonel Stone of the New York militia had taken it upon himself to burn the village of St. David 's , which had no strategic value . Stone was court-martialed and dismissed from the service , but that , as events later proved , was not sufficient to prevent the British from making reprisals . On July 24 Brown and his army arrived at Chippawa and pitched camp above the Chippawa River . Close behind the retreating Americans followed the British who were soon reported at Queenston . There were rumors , too , that Yeo 's fleet was in the Niagara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the river at Lewiston . This was indeed alarming news , for Brown had a base of supplies at Schlosser , a few miles above Lewiston . Brown knew that a British advance in force on the American side of the river would force his withdrawal from the Canadian side , if he was to maintain his communications . There was one line of action he could take that would discourage the British movement . It required boldness . That was to send Scott forward to threaten Queenston and other points on the Canadian side . As a matter of fact , the information Brown had received was incorrect . British troops had crossed the river but they were only a 257 // small force that was repulsed by a body of American militia before it reached the base at Schlosser . The British main body was still on Canadian soil and advancing rapidly from Queenston . The head of the column had already reached Lundy 's Lane , a road which ran due west from the river a short distance below Chippawa . Pursuant to Brown 's order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than 1,200 men including Towson 's artillery , crossed the bridge over the Chippawa and prepared to move forward . No sooner had he done so than he discovered the British drawn up in line of battle along Lundy 's Lane . Scott did not dare to turn back for he realized what might happen if his brigade were seized by panic while attempting to escape by the narrow bridge in its rear . Besides , retreat was not welcome to Scott 's nature . Instead he decided to put on a bold front and lead Riall to believe that he had the whole American army to fight , hoping that aid might come to him in time . As a result of the battle of Chippawa Brown 's army had been reduced to 2,644 effectives . Riall and Drummond , on the other hand , had 2,995 men . Of this force Riall , with 950 men , was already at Lundy 's Lane , Drummond was three miles away with 815 men and six miles away was another British force of 1,230 . Though Scott 's force was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Riall had materially strengthened his position by posting his artillery on a hill in the center of the line . As Scott faced the enemy his keen eye , always on the lookout for any object of tactical value , fell upon a heavy growth of brush near the river 's edge which afforded excellent cover . He directed Major Jesup to use the brush as a screen for his movements , to intercept the British reinforcements which were coming up and turn Riall 's left flank while Scott himself attacked the center of the British line . Jesup , who had undertaken the flanking movement in the battle of Chippawa , now essayed the same task at Lundy 's Lane . His men crept stealthily through the brush , completely hidden from view . All the while Scott monopolized the enemy 's attention with a heavy fire directed at the center . Before the British suspected what was happening Jesup 's men had gained not only their flank but their rear . They even overran the British headquarters and among the prisoners captured was General Riall himself . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field in such numbers that Jesup could not hold his ground and , to escape capture , he had to retreat . Brown , back at Chippawa , heard the sound of the guns and realized that Scott had run into the enemy . He ordered Ripley 's brigade and Porter 's militia to follow him at the double quick to the scene of action . When he arrived he found Scott still holding on but his brigade badly cut up . It was now 9 P.M. The sun had long since set and the field of battle was lit by a July moon , shining faintly through the smoke of the guns . In the semidarkness it was virtually impossible to distinguish friend from foe and confusion reigned in both armies . It was worse among the British where detachments became lost and fired into each other . Scott 's brigade had borne the brunt of the fighting for something like four hours . The men were exhausted and their ammunition was giving out . The General himself had been severely wounded in the shoulder but continued in command . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It soon became clear that the key to the British position was the battery of guns mounted on the hill . Turning to Colonel James Miller , a veteran of Harrison 's campaign in the west who was standing beside him , Brown ordered him to take a detachment of his 21st Regiment , all Massachusetts men , and capture the guns . " I 'll try , Sir , " was Miller 's reply , which was to become a classic and to be drummed into the heads of American schoolboys for many years to come . Taking advantage of every bush and shadow and keeping low to the ground Miller and his men crept up the side of the hill . Without being detected they came so close to the British position that they could hear the talk of the gunners and see them distinctly silhouetted against the sky in the moonlight . There was a brief moment of suspense . Then , at a given signal , the attackers fired a volley at point-blank range which mowed down every man in the gun crews . With a shout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guns , beating back the British infantry that had been stationed behind the crest of the hill to protect them . Reinforcements now came up , for news of the capture of the guns spread swiftly through the British ranks , but though they suffered heavy casualties Miller and his men beat off every attack and remained in possession of the guns . By many people the capture of 259 // the British battery at Lundy 's Lane was regarded as the most gallant action on the field throughout the whole war . The hour was now 10:30 P.M. Not only had Scott been forced to leave the field , but General Brown also had suffered a flesh wound from a bullet and a bruise from a fragment of shell . His pain was so intense that he could scarcely sit his horse and he , too , had to withdraw . Brown 's injuries seemed to affect his mental processes for he then issued an astonishing order . Though the enemy was still on the field he directed Ripley to march his brigade back to Chippawa , feed , rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at dawn to renew the engagement . There were no horses available to draw the captured guns which had to be left on the hill . Ripley obeyed this fantastic order , but it was 1 A.M. before he reached Chippawa . And , very naturally , it was considerably after dawn before the brigade was again on its way to the battlefield . Before it arrived a courier galloped up bringing the distressing news that the British had risen earlier in the day and that they were already in possession of the guns , the hill and the field . All of the previous day 's labors had been in vain . As for Major Miller who , with the men of the 21st performed such heroic action , he might just as well not have tried . The American losses at Lundy 's Lane were 171 killed , 5 ' 72 wounded and 110 missing ; the British , 84 killed , 559 wounded , 193 missing and 42 captured . The British claimed the battle as a victory . In view of the fact that they held the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claim is justified in spite of the gallantry displayed in the combat by the Americans . Most serious , however , were the wounds of Generals Brown and Scott and Major Jesup . Worst of all , the fight at Lundy 's Lane proved the last for General Scott for many years . His shoulder refused to heal and he left the front to go to Philadelphia where he was treated by the capable Dr. Physic . Before he was again ready to take the field the war had come to an end . By this time General Brown had lost all confidence in Ripley and sent for General Edmund Pendleton Gaines , who was at Sackett 's Harbor , to take over the command . Pending Gaines ' arrival Ripley was ordered to fall back to Fort Erie . Ripley was all for returning at once to American soil , but was overruled by his fellow officers . // While Drummond lingered at Lundy 's Lane awaiting reinforcements the Americans set to work with a will to strengthen Fort Erie which was badly in need of it . From July @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constructing an abatis all the way from the star fort on the right to Snake Hill on the left , where Towson 's battery was stationed . Another battery was moved into position to the right of the star fort . The stronghold now had an impressive line of fortifications in its front while its rear was protected by Lake Erie . Adding power to the defenses were two armed schooners on the lake whose guns could be trained on advancing enemy columns . On July 29 Drummond received reinforcements of 1,100 men and immediately put his army in motion toward Fort Erie . He halted and pitched camp two miles away and raised fortifications of his own . A detachment was sent across the river to attack Black Rock but failed in two attempts and returned to the Canadian side . The British now commenced a methodical siege of Fort Erie . From August 7 to August 14 they maintained a heavy bombardment , but without doing serious damage to the fort or its garrison . General Gaines had by this time arrived and assumed command . In some manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night of August 14 for his assault . While he could not be sure of the truth of the report , nevertheless he took the precaution of keeping his men on guard . It was fortunate for him that he did so . At midnight a strange silence fell over the British line . Two hours later it was broken when the American pickets , who had been thrown out in the front of the fortification , fired their muskets to give the alarm and fell back hurriedly upon the works . The British attackers , bringing scaling ladders with them , followed close behind . They were divided into three columns ; one to assault the left of the American position , one the right and one the center . On the left Towson 's battery opened up ; and , though it had to fire blind , it succeeded in driving back the enemy in that quarter . Five times the British charged against the center where Ripley 's men were stationed along the breastworks , and each time the attackers were repulsed . The defense on the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a foothold and gradually made their way into the 261 // bastion . The Americans met them in a hand-to-hand encounter and , though they held the enemy at bay , they were unable to drive them out . Dawn broke and disclosed the British still in possession . Having gained this advantage the British had more than an even chance of strengthening their hold and enfilading the whole of the American line of fortifications . Indeed at that moment the defense of the fort seemed exceedingly doubtful . At this tense moment a terrific explosion occurred . The bodies of British and Americans were hurled into the air along with dirt , stones and timbers . By some accident the magazine under the bastion had been touched off . Those of the attackers who survived the explosion imagined that they had walked into a trap deliberately set for them . Fearful that this was only a prelude to something even worse they retired to their entrenched camp , leaving the fort safe in American hands . So , thanks to an accident , the Americans won the day though in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lake were captured by the British . Drummond 's losses were severe . No less than 221 of his men were killed outright , 174 were wounded and 186 captured . The Americans got off with only 17 men killed , 56 wounded and 11 missing . Gaines became the hero of the hour . He was promoted to major general , a gold medal was struck in his honor , resolutions were drawn up by numerous patriotic bodies and he received swords from the grateful states of New York , Virginia and Tennessee . Soon after the attack of the 14th Gaines was wounded and forced to give up his command . Brown again called on Ripley to take over the defense of the fort , an appointment that proved highly unpopular with the garrison . When he learned the state of affairs Brown , in spite of his wounds , assumed command himself . Meanwhile typhoid fever broke out in the British camp and Brown decided to profit by the enemy 's misfortune , make a sortie from the fort and attack the fortified camp . He was encouraged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2,000 fresh troops . Ripley lived up to his reputation by offering objections to the proposal . In the attack on Fort Erie he had shown that he was not lacking in courage when he was on the defensive , but the mere suggestion of an advance threw him into a fit of alarm and foreboding . Ripley 's attitude , however , had no effect upon Brown . He proceeded with his plan . // September 17 was the day selected for the operations . Under cover of a thick fog the Americans moved out of their lines in three columns and approached within a short distance of the British position before their presence was discovered . They proceeded to storm the works and in less than forty minutes captured four batteries , two blockhouses and the whole line of entrenchments . But the success was not without cost . Eighty of Brown 's men lost their lives and 480 were wounded . Though the British lost 500 men in killed and wounded , and 385 of their number were captured , the Americans could not break their resistance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the attack and return to Fort Erie . The assault , however , had its effect upon Drummond for soon after he retired voluntarily to a less exposed position behind Chippawa . Preceding the battle of Plattsburg , General George Izard led an army of 4,000 men from the Champlain front to Lewiston and replaced Brown in command on the Niagara . Izard conducted several raids on the peninsula which were fruitless . His only tangible gain was the destruction of 200 bushels of wheat . In fact the American invasion had so far degenerated that Izard was ordered to abandon Canada altogether . On November 5 , Fort Erie was blown up , and the same day the last of the American troops embarked and put off for the American shore . In the course of the summer of 1814 an American army of 3,500 men had taken Fort Erie , swept clean the line of the Niagara and fought two pitched battles . It had boldly withstood an attack on Fort Erie and gallantly assaulted the camp of the attackers . Then , after some three months of marching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which it had started . It had made history , but it had not gained an inch of new territory . The operations had made the reputations of Jacob Brown and Winfield Scott ; they had damaged the reputation of Eleazar Ripley . And this was strange , for Ripley 's continued reluctance was due primarily to his belief that the campaign would accomplish nothing . The results stand as irrefutable evidence of the correctness of his belief . // Washington Burned , the Government in Flight ON JULY 15 , 1813 , when Admiral Cockburn was spreading terror in the Chesapeake Bay country , General Philip Stuart , member from Maryland , arose in the House of Representatives and offered the following resolution : " Whereas the seat of government , from the unprepared and defenseless state of the District of Columbia , is in imminent danger if an attack should be made thereon ; and whereas the fleet of the enemy is understood to be within a few hours ' sailing of the capital , and whereas the immense value of public property exposed to destruction , the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerations , render it peculiarly important that any invasion of the metropolis should be met with vigor and successfully repelled , whereupon " Resolved : That in the opinion of the House , a distribution of such arms as are in the possession of the government within the District of Columbia should be immediately made to be placed in the hands of all able-bodied men within the district willing to be embodied to perform military duty , and also in the hands of such members of the House as may be willing to receive them , to act against the enemy in any matter not incompatible with their public duties . " Here was a suggestion to do something . But in mid-July Washington is oppressively hot . At that season of the year people who suggest doing something are unpopular . Not only was General Stuart proposing that the men of the town shoulder guns and knapsacks and execute military maneuvers in the broiling sun , but he was asking his fellow members of the House to set the example . Such energetic action would be almost as bad as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FLIGHT British . Besides , Cockburn was so fully occupied in the Bay country that it seemed unlikely he would go out of his way to attack Washington which , though it was the seat of government and contained many fine buildings , was merely a straggling village of 8,000 inhabitants . At any rate , as the members mopped their brows , that was the more comfortable attitude to take . After the House had gone into secret session to discuss the resolution a motion was made to lay it on the table . Indicative of the indifference of the House toward the emergency , 64 of the members voted in the affirmative , though the motion was defeated by ten votes . A motion to strike out the preamble was then carried and the resolution , in abbreviated form , was turned over to the Committee on Military Affairs . The Committee lost no time in bringing in its report . Indeed , the speed with which it did its work suggested that it had been content to ask the opinion of the Secretary of the Navy and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was most reassuring . " The Committee on Military Affairs , " read the report , " to whom was referred a resolution of yesterday , having relation to the present movement of the enemy , report , That they have examined into the state of preparation , naval and military , made to receive the enemy , and are satisfied that the preparations are , in every respect , adequate to the emergency , and that no measures are necessary on the part of the House to make it more complete . " Having thus met the matter to their satisfaction , the members dismissed it from their minds , hoped for the best and turned their attention to the more pressing problem of how to keep cool . The inertia of the House was fully justified by subsequent events . In that summer the British fleet sailed up the Potomac but remained a good 70 miles from Washington . Almost a whole year passed before the capital had further cause for alarm . When it came , the House and the whole administration had an admirable , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapidly in Europe . After the Russian campaign ended in rout and disaster , Napoleon organized a new army and invaded Germany . In October , 1813 , the Battle of Leipsic was fought and lost by the French . Central Europe and Holland rose against Napoleon and the Allies invaded France . On March 31 , 1814 , 265 // Paris fell and the Emperor departed in exile to Elba . On June 27 a British expedition , composed of veteran troops released from the war in Spain , set sail from the Gironde for Bermuda . It was under the command of Major General Robert Ross , an Irishman who had distinguished himself under Wellington in the Peninsular War . Ross 's mission , as outlined to him by the war office , was to create a diversion to relieve the American pressure on Canada . He was not to extend his operations at a distance from the coast nor to hold permanent possession of a conquered district . The point of his attack was to be determined by Vice Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane , in command of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the needless destruction done by the Americans to their own capital of York and to the towns of Newark and St. David 's . Sir George Prevost had made known the feelings of his countrymen to Cochrane , and Cochrane accommodated himself to their desires . To the commanders of his ships from St. Croix to St. Mary 's he gave orders to " destroy and lay waste such towns and districts upon the coast as you may find assailable . " On June 2 he wrote a letter to Ross enjoining him to " assist in inflicting that measure of retaliation which shall deter the enemy from a repetition of similar outrages . " To Secretary Monroe he penned another letter threatening fire and destruction unless the United States Government should offer to make reparations for the damage done in Canada . Whether by accident or design ? some held that the letter was antedated ? Cochrane 's message did not reach ' Monroe until the destruction had been accomplished . Ross 's expedition reached Bermuda on July 24 and , after revictualing , set sail for the Chesapeake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the armada with Cochrane , Cockburn and ' Ross aboard , dropped anchor at the mouth of the Potomac River . There the three distinguished commanders engaged in a council of war and devised a plan of operations . In the Chesapeake was Commodore Joshua Barney with a strong flotilla of gunboats . Upon learning of the arrival of the British fleet Barney had taken refuge in the Patuxent River , a tributary of the bay , wide and deep enough at its mouth to harbor a modern fleet but narrowing into little more than a creek midway between Washington and Baltimore . The first objective , as agreed upon at the council , was the destruc-266 // tion of Barney 's flotilla ; the second was Baltimore ; and the third , if occasion offered , was Washington and Alexandria . Cockburn , in particular , was described as enthusiastic for a bold dash on the capital once the gunboat flotilla had been destroyed . With this end in view , the squadron , on August 17 , weighed anchor and moved up the bay to the Patuxent . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the altered situation in Europe and the dangerous consequences that might ensue in the United States . But two factors worked against his taking energetic measures to protect the capital . One was the prospect of peace . The Czar of Russia had offered to mediate and Gallatin and John Quincy Adams were already abroad prepared to undertake negotiations so soon as the British Government should agree . In answer to their recommendation the President had called his cabinet and it had consented to waive the issue of impressment as a sine qua non of the discussion . More compelling than this hope , however , was the stifling influence of the Secretary of War . General Armstrong was brusque , short-tempered and positive in his opinions . He was the soldier , Madison the civilian . Madison knew how to wield a pen but he did not know how to wield a bludgeon , and a bludgeon was needed to impress Armstrong . Armstrong held firmly to the opinion that the British had no designs on Washington . There was not a single regular in the capital . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encamped there but , in spite of the gathering storm , Armstrong permitted them to march off to the Canadian front . However , on July 1 President Madison took matters into his own hands and called another meeting of the Cabinet to discuss measures of defense . Armstrong seems to have taken no more active part in the discussion than to provide a roster of the regular troops available for service in the neighborhood of Washington . It was thereupon agreed that the President should requisition the neighboring states of Pennsylvania , Virginia and Maryland for 12,000 militia , the majority of whom would be held in their respective states , ready to march . However , not less than 2,000 nor more than 3,000 were to be assembled for immediate service at some central point between the Potomac River and Baltimore . Finally , the District of Columbia militia , and various detachments of regulars // amounting to about 3,000 in all , were to be put at the disposal of the commanding general . On paper this made a rather impressive little army of 15,000 men . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preference was Major General Moses Porter , an old soldier of the Revolution who had risen from the ranks , and who was now in command of the 5th Military District , with headquarters in Norfolk . In this particular instance the Secretary of War was overruled by the President who , instead , selected Brigadier General William H. Winder , of Maryland . To save the feelings of General Porter the District of Columbia and the neighboring territory were divorced from his command and established as the 10th Military District . William Winder was an estimable gentleman , springing from the best stock of Maryland . His ancestry and environment were irreproachable . He received a liberal education , moved from Somerset county to Baltimore and became a distinguished ornament of the Maryland bar in competition with such astute legal minds as Luther Martin , William Pinkney and William Wirt . At the outbreak of the war he relinquished his practice and patriotically offered his services to his country . He led Maryland troops to the Canadian border and there engaged in several campaigns . It will be recalled that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Chandler in the ill-fated pursuit of Vincent after the capture of Fort George . The close of Winder 's career on the border was somewhat inglorious , though he was exonerated from blame . Upon being paroled he returned to Baltimore where he received all the honors customarily bestowed upon a returning hero . Yet , in spite of his distinction , the fact remained that he had never commanded a force larger than a brigade , he was not a soldier by profession and the services he had rendered , though adequate , had not been brilliant . His selection was not based entirely upon his military achievements . There was also a political consideration which weighed heavily with Mr. Madison in making the choice . The state of Maryland had a large Federalist contingent and , when Maryland was suffering under the heel of the invader during the preceding summer , the Madison administration rendered little or no assistance and the state had to depend upon its own resources . Now the shoe was on the other 269 // foot . It was Washington that needed the assistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the state was Levin Winder , an uncle of the General . So , reasoned Mr. Madison and his advisers , if the nephew of the Governor were given command of the 10th District , Maryland might be expected to enter more heartily into the defense of the capital . Never was an honor more fraught with impending disaster than that bestowed upon General Winder by President Madison . It was already known that a British expedition had set out for the United States and that its arrival was imminent . To meet the crisis , Winder had been given an army of 15,000 men but as yet it was an army on paper only . His superior , the Secretary of War , had not favored his appointment and did not promise the most complete cooperation . The newly created district was without magazines , provisions for forage , transport tools , general staff or troops . As one observer remarked , Winder " was left to the necessity of being his own commissary , his own secretary , his own vidette and to be himself his own express @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was about to endure a nightmare lasting no less than six weeks . Winder was notified of his appointment on July 5 and immediately entered with zeal upon his duties . At once the hopeless inefficiency of the preparations began to assert itself . General Armstrong delayed several days sending out the requisitions to the governors for the militia . When the Governor of Pennsylvania received his he replied that he lacked constitutional powers to raise his quota . At once Winder 's paper army was reduced by 4,000 men . The Maryland quota called for 6,000 , but Baltimore , Annapolis and Chesapeake Bay were as greatly threatened as Washington and Governor Winder was naturally unwilling to surrender all his troops for the defense of Washington . The 2,000 or 3,000 militia that were immediately to be concentrated at a point between the Potomac and Baltimore failed to put in an appearance and Winder appealed to the Secretary of War . But General Armstrong , it appeared , had a pet aversion to keeping militia idle in camp before the arrival of the enemy . The Secretary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mode of using militia was upon the spur of the occasion , and to bring them // to fight as soon as called out . " This remarkable theory was to have an excellent practical test a few weeks later at Bladensburg . For 18 days , between July 9 and 27 , while awaiting the raising of his army , Winder traveled constantly on horseback through the country he was expected to defend . He was at Baltimore , Annapolis , Marlboro , the Wood Yard , Nottingham , Piscataway , Warburton , and Port Tobacco ; several times at the same place and several times at Washington . That area is included in a triangle with sides roughly 30 miles in length , which gives some idea of the distance he must have covered . Bladensburg , a few miles north of the national capital , Winder had selected as the rendezvous . Yet as late as July 23 he was writing to Armstrong : " It will be necessary that arms , ammunition , accoutrements , tents and camp equipage be deposited there for them the troops . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearest the point , nor under whose charge they are . " Already weary in mind and body Winder established his headquarters in Washington on August 1 . At that late date no line of defense had been selected . Not a breastworks had been raised . Not a single tree was felled across a road to delay the march of the enemy . The total force assembled at Bladensburg amounted to one lone company of Maryland militia . On August 18 a messenger dashed into Washington to announce the alarming news of the arrival of the British fleet in the Patuxent . Then , at last , the President ordered out all the militia and regulars near Washington and sent fresh requisitions to the near-by governors for militia . Yet even at that late hour the Secretary of War remained unconvinced of the peril that hung over the capital . To General Van Ness , commander of the District of Columbia militia , who expressed grave anxiety over the situation , Armstrong replied , " What the devil will they do here ? No , no ; Baltimore is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequence . " To Winder during the next few days Armstrong gave abundant advice . What he failed to provide was the means of carrying it out . While the commanding officer remained in Washington to catch up on his paper work and respond to the hundreds of miscellaneous duties that fell to his lot , James Monroe volunteered to go to the 271
