txt While most of the countries of continental Europe are being brought under the sway of the totalitarian revolution , Britain , with characteristic deliberation , is going gradually ahead with a revolution of its own . One by one , directly or indirectly , the continental nations seem to be going down like ninepins before the combined onslaught of mechanized might and revolutionary aopaganda . The little Baltic states have capitulated to Josef Stalin as completely as the Scandinavian peoples are dominated by Adolf Hitler . The Balkans appear to be breaking up under the simultaneous threat from the three dictatorships of Russia , Germany , and Italy . Rumania has in the past few days Virtually gone over to Naziism after the loss of Bessarabia to the Soviets . Yugoslavia is showing ominous signs of cracking , under the strain . Hungary and Bulgaria are hardly more than pawns . Turkey is about to be submitted to heavy pressure by Russia . At the other end of the Mediterranean , Spain is being tied by Gen. Francisco Franco and his Falangist followers tighter and tighter to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sudden collapse of France and its chameleonic change from a rampart of democracy to an antidemocratic regime modeled on Nazi and Fascist lines has sharply thrown into relief the revolutionary nature of the present European upheaval . Watching this new French revolution , as well as other wholesale changes on the continent , the British have been driven to ask themselves : " What of the democratic regime in our own land ? Will it withstand the disruptive revolutionary forces working from within as well as the attempted invasion from without ? " The other day I attended , without knowing what I was getting into , a strange and remarkable meeting where " revolution " in Britain was freely discussed . A number of fairly prominent political and literary figures , mostly . from the Left , harangued one another vigorously . The word " revo- lution " occurred frequently in their impromptu speeches . Yet this unusual gathering  --  whose avowed intention was to obtain ? a more vigorous prosecution of the war  --  does not represent the real revolution which is now under way in Britain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is a typically English affair . Like most revolutions in England 's history , it is mainly pacific , even in the midst of war . The Times Points Way What is the essence of the revolutionary change now at work in the United kingdom ? It is extremely difficult Lo. - define . So far it has no detailed program , no battle cry , hardly even a slogan . Oddly enough it is that organ of tradition and conservatism , The Times , of London , which has come closest to providing a program for Britain 's revolution . In a leading article last week , which already has become historic . The Times said : " Over the greater part of Western Europe the main values for which we stand are known and prized . We must indeed beware of defining these values in purely nineteenth century terms . If we speak of democracy , we do n't mean a democracy which maintains the right to vote but forgets the right to work and the right to live . If we speak of equality , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic privileges . If we speak of freedom , we do n't mean a rugged individualism which excludes social organization and economic planning . If we speak of economic reconstruction , we think less of maximum production though this too will be required than of equitable distribution . " In the same editorial , The Times declared that " the problem of the new European order is , after all . the problem of every political organization : How to combine individual liberties with the authority necessary for social cohesion . " It went on to say that " the anarchic tendencies , of laissez faire are as obsolete internationally as they are in domestic policy . Some measure of pooled resources and centralized control is necessary for the survival of European civil-. / ization . " " Pooled resources and centralized control " ? these expressions summarize fairly accurately in a general way the stage Britain 's revolution has now reached . Government control of trade , of industry , of labor , of food production , and distribution has gone far beyond anything that would have I been imagined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stocks and rationalizing of production and even of overseas trade under centralized state control has thrown British business a long way along the road of economic planning . But the revolution in England is by no means confined to the economic sphere . Politically , the introduction of so many labor leaders into key posts in the Cabinet marks a new era . There are few persons who question the fact that Mr. Herbert Morrison and Mr. Ernest Bevin as Ministers of Supply and Labor are , after Prime Minister Winston Churchill , the mainsprings of Britain 's new leadership . These two men of the people have , in their few short weeks , silenced those multitudes who not many months ago were insisting that labor leadership at a time of crisis such as this would be catastrophic . Socially , three factors are destined to have revolutionary effects . The first is conscription . That is important not merely because men of all classes and strata of society are thrown together in the new militia army  --  though this is certainly important . It is also important because labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a Socialist Minister of Labor has the power to conscript the services or the property or wealth of any and every British man and woman . The most important innovation here is this : That whereas in the past the British people have felt that their safety and their victory have depended chiefly , if not entirely , on the exclusive and rather aristocratic navy or on a not very large nor very representative army , today there is a keen and growing realization that the continued independence , in fact the very existence of Britain , depends on the labor of every man and woman in these isles being put unstintedly to ( the very best use in the service of the Nation . Modern militarized warfare  --  total war  --  and particularly the impending threat of invasion has driven home to the British people the realization that labor and the production of the laborer and the producer are all important . Evacuation Is Factor The second factor in the social revolution is evacuation . The ultimate effect of this drastic shift in populations depends , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there has been a salutary mingling of children , mothers , and older persons from towns , and particularly from the poorer overpopulated industrial areas , with other strata of the British people . This first-hand experience being shared by millions has brought ' home in a way nothing else can the realization of how " the other half " I lives . Social problems which before were something for abstract consideration by hundreds of thousands of individuals have now become urgent human problems . Related to this is the third factor , education . War has struck one of its hardest blows at the British public school system . These exclusive schools are finding it hard to carry on . There is a serious project under consideration to give state aid to many of them and . in return , to modify if not abandon their traditional role as producers of the " ruling class " in Britain . Few things have been under such intense lire lately as the " old school " tie . Rightly or wrongly , there is a tendency on the part of the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ termed the " old gang " of conservative politicians with the public school type of Englishman , and to turn more and more away from this type for future leadership . Brake on Revolution Along with the " old school " tie , civil service in Britain has become one of the principal targets . Its honesty , its freedom from corruption , even its effectiveness in normal times are not challenged . The question that is being asked more and more insistently is whether what is termed " civil service spirit " is not a grave deterrent to the 100 per cent effort which it is realized must be made if Britain is to meet the totalitarian threat . The essence of the ' problem is that the British Civil Service , in the diplomatic , political , administrative , and other branches of public life , tends naturally to take a negative and passive attitude , Every civil servant knows very well he can not ' be penalized or dismissed for doing nothing , but he oses himself to the risk of censtt3e if he does anything which ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the average civil servant concentrates his efforts on avoiding initiative as much as possible and on maintaining the status ' quo which provides a very satisfactory situation for him . This " civil service attitude , " combined with the inherent tradition and conservatism of many English people and leaders , constitutes a brake on Britain 's new revolution . This brake is , of course , as indispensable to the nonviolent progress of Britain 's wartime revolution as is its driving force . The ' problem is to maintain a proper I balance and to let the changes gol on fast enough without letting them go too fast or too far . At the moment there is a wide- I spread feeling that too much use is being made of the brake . The demand is for speed and more drastic action . But it is probably ' a fact that as long as Parliament and the press are able to give free voice to this demand , the pent-up forces of change will be able to find expression without explosion . The greatest need , many persons here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for more dynamic devotion to the true essense of democracy . A letter in The Times from the Bishop of Chichester crystallizes this in striking form . It says in part : " While our struggle with Germany is both on a military and a spiritual plane , it is the struggle on the spiritual plane which is most crucial . " There is only one creed that can conquer that of National Socialism . It is the Christian creed . The main source in the spiritual life of Europe is Christianity . Christendom without Christianity is dead . We shall prevail against the Germans when we give the Christian religion . . . the same place in our lives , and in our political and social system , as they give the Nazi religion in theirs . It has not got that place , or anything like it , in England as yet . To secure that , place is . . . a challenge to statesmen , and men of affairs , men in business and industry , to laymen of sall communions , and in every calling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
