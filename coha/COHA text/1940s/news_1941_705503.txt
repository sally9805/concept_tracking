txt President Roosevelt was reported today to be considering a plan to allow American merchant vessels to carry war materials into the belligerent waters of Halifax , N. S. , starting point for most North Atlantic convoys . An authoritative source said today that the President had not reached a decision , and would " exhaust every other alternative " before reaching any conclusion on the escorting of convoys of merchantmen by American warships . The plan to deliver munitions to the British at Halifax would require legislation . Under the Neutrality Act of November , 1939 , American ships are not allowed to carry arms to the ports of a nation declared to be a belligerent . Some congressional leaders expressed the opinion today , however , that a request by Mr. Roosevelt for an amendment would not meet serious opposition . Although some Administration leaders oppose the Halifax plan as " untimely , " others believe it could be followed with little danger to American ships and with great help to the British . At present , British ships must pick up most of their American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 700 miles to Halifax to join the convoys . By delivering planes , oil and other war material at Halifax , American ships would release some British ships from the New YorkHalifax run and speed up the entire North Atlantic convoy system . Before any decision is reached by the President about Halifax he is expected to remove by proclamation the ban on ships entering the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea . There is concern here about the developing Italo-German drive toward Egypt in Africa , as well as in the Balkans , and since the collapse of Italian resistance on the Red Sea coast yesterday plans are being rushed to ship material to the British . It is recognized that the opening of the Red Sea and Halifax routes would not solve the British shipping problem , but these plans illustrate the steps considered by the Administration to stave off the day when , it is generally admitted , a // PRESIDENT WEIGHS SHIPS TO HALIFAX // decision must he reached about convoying with warships . Coastal Ships in Mind Several days ago Administration shipping officials were asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that could he taken to give Britain more ships immediately , or to increase the speed , carrying capacity and safety of her convoys . These suggestions have been sifted and some are already going into effect . Outside of the obvious suggestions of transferring more merchant vessels and warships to the British , there was a pi proposal to re- , lease ships from the United States coastal trade by transferring their cargoes to the railroads . There are now 420 ships of 2.062. - 248 gross tons operating in the coastal and intercoasta I trade . Some of these are not large enough or in condition for transatlantic , service : others are carrying cargoes ; that can not be transported by rail . and many more are needed to carry strategic war materials for our own defense program . Many others are engaged in " non-essential " work , ? however . and it is reliably esti-I mated that between 50 and 100 ' could he released to British crews for work in the North Atlantic . Rail Shipments Increasing The British have been helped already by this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British vessels have wasted a great deal of time in transporting lumber from the Northwest through the Panama Canal . Canadian and American railroads are now bringing much of this lumber across the country , thus speeding up transport . The second suggestion was that American bombers flying to Britain daily should he organized into a " transatlantic patrol " to spot submarines . In the past , the policy has been to concentrate on getting the American bombers to the other side . All available space has been filled with reserve gasoline and the planes have been operated by skeleton crews . It was suggested that these bombers travel over a predetermined convoy route . The idea of an air convoy is gaining support . It is recognized that Britain is still suffering from a lack of large , long-distance bombers and flying boats , but many observers here believe t he United States should . if necessary , risk its ! flying boats in such a patrol before allowing its warships to go into the U-boat zones . More Economic Pressure Urged Although the Administration 's economic pressure on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many departments have urged the adoption of a more vigorous policy of economic warfare . From several quarters , the President has been urged to exercise more drastic control over both exI ports and imports . This , it is pointed out , would not only put greater pressure on Germany , Italy , and Japan , but release ships to carry essential war materials , into this country and Britain . It is recognized , however , that this preoccupation with means of finding more merchant ships for the British and trying to patch up the inadequate British convoys is merely part of a passing phase , and that sooner or later the administration must face the question of usingl American warships to convoy its ' own war materials to Britain . Admiral Emory S. Land , chairman of the Maritime Commission , intimated in a radio address Monday night that American convoys would eventually have to be used to master the submarine . Many other officials , particularly officers at the Navy Department , are now expressing the same opinion , but the President evidently believes the people are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measures short of convoy , such as opening up the Halifax and Red Sea routes to American ships , and pressure on American shipowners are being considered cautiously .
