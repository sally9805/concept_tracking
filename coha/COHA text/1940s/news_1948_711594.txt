txt Author of Formula Urges Balanced Development for Peace or War Use By MEYER BERGER Bernard Baruch said last night that he did not believe another war was imminent , but that fear of war remained . He blamed Soviet leaders for vetoing " the American dream of a world free of the threat of atomic destruction " and advised that the United States " strike a wise balance between peaceful and military development of atomic energy . " Mr. Baruch spoke at the seventeenth annual New York Herald Tribune forum at the WaldorfAstoria . Hotel . The forum subject was " Our Imperiled Resources . " At the same meeting Paul G. Hoffman , Economic Cooperation Administrator , said he thought man could master his conservation problems unless war , which he called " the ultimate in reckless , waste , " should intervene . Other speakers warned that greedy growers , reaching for high postwar profits , were bringing on a new Dust Bowl era . " The threat of a new war 's destruction already overshadows the devastation of the old , " Mr. Baruch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , told the listeners . " I do not believe another war imminent , and hope it eventually will be averted . But the fear remains . To what distortions of our lives , hopes and habits we shall have to submit because of this overhanging dread , can not now be fully foreseen . " The great problem , he said , was to manage peaceful resources while preparing against war . " Viewed in , perspective , the tasks ahead are not hopeless , " he i declared . " We dare ot face the future with complacency , but we need not face it with despair . " He said the problem was one of education , of substituting intelligent saving for stupid waste . " The struggle is largely one of man against himself , between the instincts that make wreckers and those that make creators , " Mr. // Baruch said . " As old as the Biblical conflict between the forces of light and darkness , this struggle is also as new as atomic energy . Links Atomic Energy to Peace " The problem of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pre-eminently a wrestling between the fears which chain us to atomic development for destruction , against the courage to seek its fullest peaceful ' release . It was to free atomic energy for usefulness that the American people took the bold and unprecedentedly generous action of offering to give up this , the most powerful weapon in history , on one condition  --  that no other nation be able to make the bomb . " Since the Soviet leaders  --  not the Russian- people , who have never known the American proposal  --  have vetoed . the American dream of a world free of the threat of atomic destruction , we must continue manufacturing atomic weapons . But fear of war must not freeze peaceful atomic use . Our task is to strike a wise balance between peaceful and military development  --  the same balance needed all through life . " Mr. Baruch spoke of " dream seeds , " the potentialities of atomic energy applied to peaceful ends . He said there was a possibility of atomic isotopes unlocking the mystery of photosynthesis ; a chance that man may one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; a likelihood that ocean water may , some time in the future , be distilled to irrigate great stretches of earth that now lie barren . " Perhaps , " he said , " the No. 1 job of conservation , immediately ahead , is to restore and conserve man 's faith in his ability to govern himself . If that is lost , all is lost . It is essential , if we are to discipline ourselves to halt the waste of natural resources , to edncs'e our children to live in greater harmony with the land , to preserve the vigor of peaceful enterprise in the shadow of war . " Hoffman Sees Us Learning Mr. Hoffman said he had heard experts predict a dark future for humankind if conservation were not taken up immediately . " I am not made pessimistic by the facts and trends that have been reported today , " he said . " We are learning how to master the processes which destroy our Soil . We can master them if we have the will , and so , also , can Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long-range out , look for food . " Mr. Hoffman described the Marshall Plan as a program to promote peace and to conserve human and physical resources . Then he said : " War is the great despoiler of all resources  --  the ultimate - in reckless waste , the final stupidity . I for one believe that unless we can , with honor , avoid war , all planning ' for conservation will be waste , void and without significance . " Our one great hope to avoid war is , I believe , to keep our free America strong and prosperous , to help the free nations of Western Europe regain their strength - and prosperity , and to bind the free , strong prosperous nations of the Western world together into a union so firm that no aggressor will dare to march against it . " Fairfield Osborn , president of the New York Zoological Society and president of the Conservation Foundation , told how the world was becoming overcrowded , with a prospect that its population might rise to three billion or more by the end of the century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when the United States was born . William Vogt , chief of the conservation section of the PanAmerican Union , spoke bitterly of greedy farmers . He said that because corn and wheat prices have been high , such growers have ignored conservation for profit , " and we 're ' waiting only for a dry year or two to have another Dust Bowl . " Gordon R. Clapp , chairman of the board of the Tennessee Valley Authority , told of the benefits of that project . Louis Bromfield , author-farmer , described extensive conservation studies of his own acres and warned , " When our natural resources are gone it will not matter much how much gold we have buried at Fort Knox . " A panel of five experts discussed American land policy . On this panel were Mr. Clapp ; Bernard DeVoto , author ; Farrington R. Carpenter , member of the executive council of the American Livestock Association ; Kent Leavitt , president of the National Association of Soil Conservation Districts and Representative Clifford R. Hope of Kansas , chairman of the House Agricultural Committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agencies for setting up " little kingdoms " in the range country and " putting cattlemen out of business on the false charge that they are eneinies of conservation . " Mr. DeVoto answered that it seemed to be the attitude of cattlemen that " because their grandfathers ruined a good part of the country , we should allow the current generation to ruin the rest of it .
