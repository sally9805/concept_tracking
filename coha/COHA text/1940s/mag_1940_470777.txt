IN THE early spring of 1866 a young man named William Dean Howells quietly slipped into Boston . He was twenty-nine years old , slight , with a black mustache , mild in manner and modest in appearance . One saw that he had delicate perceptions and a shrewd gift of observation , and he gave one a marked impression of will and purpose . The brooding look in his eyes betokened a future . This young man had realized a bold ambition . The editor of the Atlantic Monthly , James T. Fields , had given him a post as coadjutor . Six years before , he had come to Boston , commissioned by his paper in Ohio , with hopes that he had openly confessed . In the Western Reserve , where he had lived , Boston was a sort of holy city . The people had largely come from New England , and those who cared for letters regarded Boston as many of the Bostonians regarded London . It was the hub of the universe , as Oliver Wendell Homes had said , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pilgrim , aspired to be the " linchpin in the hub . " His only recommendation was a poem in the Atlantic , and Boston had nothing to offer him at the moment ; but before he returned to the West , after this flying visit , an incident occurred that foreshadowed his future . Lowell invited him to dinner , to meet Holmes and Fields , in a little upper room at the Parker House . The talk lasted four hours , and Holmes said to Lowell , " Well , James , this is something like the apostolic succession . This is the laying on of hands . " The doctor 's little joke was prophetic , as time was soon to show . The young man had impressed the Boston and Cambridge Olympians . " Howells is sure to be somebody if he lives , " Lowell had written to Fields , who had called him back six years later ; and Charles Eliot Norton , struck by the papers on Venetian life he had published in the Boston Advertiser , exerted himself to find and helped him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There , with his wife whom he had married in Paris for he had been living abroad , as consul in Venice ? Howells passed the first of the twenty years that he was to spend in New England . A sweet-brier grew over the door and pine trees flanked the gate . There were pear trees in the yard and tangles of grapes and blackberries . When he was not in his office , reading proofs and writing reviews , or jogging back and forth on the horse-car that ran from Harvard Square , or working on his essays and travel sketches ? for he had scarcely begun to think of himself as a novelist he fed his eyes and ears with the Boston scene . Three years in Venice had not dispelled for Howells the charm of New England . He had acted with a strategy that marked his life for fifty years . A campaign biography of Lincoln had brought him his appointment as consul at Venice , and he had set his cap at Boston as the indisputable center of American letters . Later he was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York , or when , as people said , he carried it with him . At present , surrounded by men who aroused his ambition , in an atmosphere that stirred his imagination , he felt his every faculty on the stretch . He had been just in time , on his earlier visit , during the two days he had spent in Concord , to see Thoreau and Hawthorne , who had passed him on to Emerson with a friendly note ; and the sage had opened his door for the young man from the West and looked at him with a vague serenity . The exaltations of Concord were not for Howells , whose appetite was all for visible facts , much as he revered these luminaries , although Hawthorne , whom he adored as an artist , said what Howells felt : he longed to see an America that was free from the shadow of Europe . But he had not forgotten his excitement when , after meeting Dr. Holmes , he had walked the streets and the Common till two in the morning . He had approached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had first seen the ocean , and the meadows , newly mown , and the gray stone walls , the crumbling forts , the half-deserted harbors had evoked the American past of the histories and poems , as the great square mansions of Portsmouth and Salem , withdrawing themselves in reserve from the quiet streets , suggested a more complex civilization than he had known in the West . Marblehead meant Whittier 's ballad , Nahant recalled Longfellow , while the gaunt old hip-roofed houses brought back the magic of Hawthorne ; and Boston had overwhelmed him at the first encounter . Was it not a legend in the West that everything noble and grand , in the national life , everything magnanimous and enlightened , had originated in Boston ? There was the " cradle of liberty , " Faneuil Hall , a symbol of the days when there were giants , and there the genius of freedom had risen again in Garrison , Charles Sumner , and Wendell Phillips . There King 's Chapel stood , and Bunker Hill , the State House , the Old Corner Bookstore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Granary Burial Ground , renowned in poems . There Cornhill ran its crooked length , the resort of the antiquaries and the bookworms , and the back of Beacon Hill was an architectural jumble that rivaled Dr. Johnson 's haunts for quaintness . One saw the Franklin tomb , the black old gravestones of the sixteen-thirties , the Park Street Church at Brimstone Corner , the Frog Pond , the Long Path , where the Autocrat had asked a well-known question ; and there whole shelves of the books of one 's childhood strolled about the streets in flesh and blood . Faces rose out of the crowd , at casual moments , that one had known for years in pictures , the Autocrat 's quizzical visage or Richard Henry Dana 's ; or possibly one saw Emerson descending from a horse-car , or the scarcely less fabulous Dr. Howe , the husband of Julia Ward Howe , who had written the " Battle Hymn of the Republic . " The " sailors with bearded lips " sauntered about the waterfront , as if they had stepped straight out of Long-fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and accent satisfied one 's thirst for recognitions . History was visible and tangible in Boston . Was it not known that Copley 's daughter still lived in Beacon Street , the painter 's dearest Betsy , the sister of Lord Lyndhurst , three times chancellor of England ? Mrs. Greene , born Elizabeth Copley in Boston , had heard Burke 's opening speech at the trial of Warren Hastings . She had known Sir Joshua Reynolds , not as a child but as a grown young lady . As her father 's reader and constant companion , in the painting room in London , she had talked with Fox and Pitt and Mrs. Siddons . She remembered meeting Charlotte , the heroine of The Sorrows of Werther . Then , marrying a Boston man , she had witnessed every event in the town since the year of her return , 1800 . Nor was Mrs. Greene the only person who recalled the building of the State House . Venerable figures and things abounded in Boston . There was something harmonious and mellow , something old or odd , at every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps , the " Boston look , " a blessing for the budding man of letters . * The aspirant from the West had arrived at the psychological moment . ' Fen years before , the city of light and learning could scarcely have offered a foothold to the stoutest invader . Dominant , abundant , efflorescent , it was all too well supplied by its own New England , as twenty years hence the stout invader might not have cared to scale the Boston wall . At present , with the breach the war had made , and with all the treasure still within the city , Boston was ripe for invasion , and most of the younger writers throughout the country shared Howells 's feeling about it . New England ideals and examples had a commanding influence wherever people cared for thought and writing , and eastern Massachusetts was hallowed ground for thousands of the rising generation . Many a pilgrim like William Winter walked out to Cambridge in the moonlight merely to touch the latch of Longfellow 's gate . Many walked to Concord for a glimpse of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knock at the door . Others , like Forseythe Willson , who had written The Old Sergeant , admired and praised by Longfellow , Lowell , and Holmes , too shy to announce their presence , installed themselves in lodgings , in order to be near these famous men . These worthies were " high priests , " as the Atlantic was a " temple , " in the eyes of Emily Dickinson , who lived at Amherst . Miss Dickinson , a lawyer 's daughter , a somewhat rebellious young lady , whose friends left books for her in hiding-places , had visited during the war in Boston and Cambridge . She had ? The " Boston look " was a near-sighted look . occasionally assumed or affected , that presupposed an interest in all things intellectual . It was a favorite subject of the comic artists , especially in New York . where it was supposed that Boston people wore spectacles in their cradles.dreamed of meeting Tennyson in the office of Ticknor and Fields , and Cambridge for her was rather like Westminster Abbey . In the West , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meanwhile , for those who were merely romantic , the atmosphere of Boston had much of the bookish charm of Charles Lamb 's London . The auctioneers quoted Shakespeare ; and , if you entered a corner grocery , perhaps to buy a codfish , the man would ask you how you liked Lucile while he was tying it up . Many a queer old soul haunted the bookstalls , in quest of some ancient print or musty pamphlet , a relic of Fisher Ames 's days , or the days of Benjamin Franklin , or Swift and Pope . Another young writer who had settled in Boston , in the same year as Howells , after having lived in New York , wrote to one of his friends , " The humblest man of letters has a position here which he does n't have in New York . To be known as an able writer is to have the choicest society open to you . . . . A knight of the quill here is supposed necessarily to be a gentleman . In New York ? he 's a Bohemian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " In short , the " American Athens " still deserved its name , seldom as one heard this any longer . In 1855 Theodore Parker had called the town the " American Dublin , " which was almost more to the point , for the Irish power was rapidly rising with other strains of foreign birth . There were signs that the building days of New England were over , and all things were ripe for change in Boston . But the Yankees were omnipotent still in numbers , wealth , and prestige , and Boston had no second as a seat of culture . In some of the country districts , where culture had less glamour , and more primitive traits of character had larger sway , the natives , whose necks were usually stiff , challenged the pretensions of their Athens . " Boston folks arc full of notions " was a proverb in Rhode Island , and culture itself , in other parts , where good sense abounded , scanned with a doubtful eye the cant of culture . In New York , where nothing annoying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that , to enter the city , you had to pass an examination , and that when you left it , if you passed , you were given a kind of degree . The New Yorkers could afford to talk thus lightly , for the goddess of Boston was none of theirs ; but for those who had to recognize the goddess ? alien writers , artists , lecturers the Boston test was formidable , and sometimes alarming . For Mark Twain , who lectured there in 1869 , a Boston audience signified " 4,000 critics " ; and a Boston man 's mere presence in many a rural household struck terror into the heart of the local performer . Some of the younger Bostonians , feeling the danger that lurked in this , more for themselves than it lurked for the local performer , fled the city for other parts , through fear of being a " Boston prig , " an intellectual prig , the worst of all . Complacency , a pride of power that had not sufficiently tested itself , was , as it remained , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a consciousness of culture that others found insufferable or funny ; and many a visitor shared the feeling expressed by one who came to stay when he said that a group of Bostonians with whom he had talked were " simmering in their own fat and putting a nice brown on one another . " But Boston had earned its good name ; and , as for the unkind things that were said about it , one usually found some Boston man who had said them first and better . As the " little man " remarked in The Professor , Boston had opened , and kept open , more turnpikes leading to free thought and free speech and free deeds than any other city in the country . II The focus of culture in Boston was the Saturday Club , the club that Dr. Holmes would have invented if spontaneous generation had not produced it . There , once a month , the illuminati , the Auto-crat and Emerson and Lowell , Longfellow , Dana , Asa Gray and Sumner , Agassiz and Charles Eliot Norton , Charles Francis Adams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , met for the talk in which the town excelled . For Boston abounded in good conversation . Experienced outsiders , guests of the club , or perhaps of the atlantic , at one of its dinners , or at some private dinner for public men , were struck by the quality of this conversation . Sometimes , at two successive dinners , the same men talked for eight hours without a sign of fatigue , and the conversation never fell off in interest . If Dr. Holmes was not the center of it , the others mostly had their centers elsewhere , in Cambridge , in Concord , in Washington or London , while the Autocrat was not only Bostonian but more than anything else a talker . His poems were versified conversation , he had Boswellized himself , and , in his airy way , he had scattered freely , more freely than the profounder minds , the ideals that had made his town a center of culture . It was he who had named the Brahmins and described their function as leaders of learning and bringers of light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern science . It was he who had smitten the Philistines hip and thigh and routed the tribe of the Pooh-Poops with clouds of arrows , and , withal , as a wise old family doctor , he treated the Yankee household with a heart that was full of pity for human nature . Could one hold his incomprehensions against this lover of excellent things , who was always so bright and wide-awake ? He was certainly unfair to the reformers , and there were other doctors , well instructed , who felt he was setting up the old caste-idol , who resented his assaults on rustic manners and , still more , on the Orthodox faith , the better sides of which he knew not of ; for " The One-Hoss Shay " and The Guardian Angel , which aroused the indignation of thousands , true as they were , were not the truth regarding the depths of the old religion . Many of Dr. Holmes 's constant readers found much that was hard to bear in what he said , and in fact he was a wit and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sages . But what was Voltaire , what was Erasmus ? ? with whom he had so much in common , as a highly intelligent man , the most intelligent man in New England . He laid trains of thought that later became abuses , as the Boston mind developed under other conditions ; but whose heart , with all its foibles , was more innocent than his , or even more truly religious ? His hymns were sincere , with a touch of sublimity . No one loved life more , or fought for it more gallantly , as he fought for the sports that stood for health and the poems that stood for expressive living . He loved all sorts and conditions of men , as he loved prize-fights and trotting-horses , trees , good cattle , boats , and violins . The Autocrat stood for Boston in its hour of triumph . For Boston was indeed triumphant . Its conversation bore witness to this . The town possessed authority in every sphere . If it was ripe for change , for assaults from without and within , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war had been " Mrs. Stowe 's war , " in President Lincoln 's phrase , and , if Mrs. Stowe was not a possession of Boston , at least she appeared at Atlantic dinners , wearing her wreath of laurel . Charles Francis Adams , who lived at Quincy and had always quarreled with Boston , belonged more to Boston than to anything else , and , if Adams had not caused the war , he had certainly helped to win it : he had helped almost as much as Grant or Sherman by holding the British at bay . Motley , the Boston historian , represented his country at two important posts . Sumner , the Boston statesman , was unique in the Senate . He was the one man there , as even his enemies said , who , during the war years and after , kept in view the interests of thought and science ; for , if Boston had power and prestige in public matters , which gave an additional tang to its conversation , much more was thisthe case in affairs of the mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held in equal scales " the Yankee 's how , ' the stammering Briton 's haw " ; and its great new technological schools , its quarterlies , monthlies , and weeklies , the Lowell Institute and other centers , not to mention the Boston Symphony , soon to be founded , were institutions of national significance . The North American Review was recapturing its leading position . The supremacy of the Atlantic was unquestioned . To have published a poem in it , as the case of Howells showed , was to be known among writers all over the country . It was a force indeed throughout the country , setting the critical standard and spreading suggestions . Boston excelled in the machinery of culture , as well as in culture itself . In days to come , the Saturday Club , where the Boston Olympians gathered , reflected all the changes of the Yankee mind . Consisting chiefly of authors at first , acknowledged leaders of national thought , it altered when it alteration found . Local worthies , eminent men , but eminent mainly as men of Boston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sanction . As the scope of the membership altered so did the types , and lawyers and judges , professors of science , economists , physicists , chemists largely supplanted the men of letters , who spoke for the soul as well as the mind of the race . If Howells , after his first visit , observing the Boston of 1860 , felt that he must keep himself " in cotton " till he had a chance to see it again , one knew what he meant and understood it ; and the day had not yet come when all men said , the Bostonians most of all , " Ichabod , the glory is departed . " Two centuries lay behind the New England writers , and , if they largely ruled the national mind , if they were notes populi , there were reasons for it . They had grown in the great tradition of the Revolution , they were closely connected with the soil , they were readers and students of the classics ? three elements , deeply related , that explained their power and accounted for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Revolution , they spoke for the liberal world-community . As men who loved the land and rural customs , they shared the popular life in its roots , at its source . As readers and students of the classics , they followed great patterns of behavior , those that Europeans followed also . In short , as magnanimous men , well seasoned , they wrote with a certain authority and not as the scribes . If they believed in progress , and felt that America led the way , they professed their faith in a fashion that commanded respect ; for they had known doubts and struggles , wars and vigils , and they made their profession of faith as men who had won it , not without years in the wilderness and days of blindness . They had cultivated their gardens , they knew the country , the seacoast and the homestead , the lakes and mountains , where they had wandered as boys and lived as weather-wise men , familiar with plants and animals , the ways of nature , the trades and occupations of the people . Emerson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farms , and some of them , like Sumner , resembled Webster in their knowledge of common farming and all the species of cattle , domestic and foreign ; and they knew ships and shipping and the forest as well as they knew men and cities . Their books were full of all these human interests , this deep sense of the local earth , a sense that was fed by their classical studies ; for the Greek and Roman authors , most of whom were countrymen , had treated r:ral life with affectionate understanding . The reading of Virgil and Horace , who abounded in genial pictures of it , had always gone hand in hand with respect for the farmer . The decline of classical studies and the loss of respect for rural life concurred , in the age to come , with disastrous results . The Saturday Club , as time went on , witnessed many changes . Already , more and more , with the rise of the railroads , with the growth of the factory system , the Brahmins were going into banking , retaining their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handsome appellation pleased the patricians , who had sometimes done little to deserve it , but who were not unwilling to appear as tinctured with the well-known Boston culture , as patrons and even protagonists of it . The acquisitive instinct that marked the Yankees , diverted into other channels , where it had produced such victories of the mind , was returning to its original channel ; and trade itself was losing its wide horizons . The stately commerce of old , the India and China traffic , had been ruined by steamships and tariffs . This trade of an earlier day had connected Boston with the history of Samarkand and Venice and given it some of the splendor of Lisbon and Antwerp , and the young men who sailed before the mast ? perhaps reading Prescott in the maintop ? or went as supercargoes to Sumatra , had lived the sort of lives that were pictured in Homer . The days were past forever when the Danas and the John Lowells roamed the world as argonauts or wrote their wills among the ruins of Thebes ; and the young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their lives at desks in State Street , hugging their stocks and bonds and " standing pat . " This day had not yet come , though it was coming , as alien races pressed on the native race , as new religions rose , with alien faiths . Then the city lost interest in the country , except as a field of exploitation , for business or for holiday-making , and problems of immigration and factory problems replaced the older problems of good and evil , and men , immersed in money , ceased to read , and the " feminization of literature " was a haunting question . One could foresee a New England turned in upon itself , while Boston , sulking in its tent , refused to play with Denver and San Francisco . III At present , outside the Saturday Club lay social , financial , and " earnest " Boston , three Bostons known to fame , and all represented in it , that stretched far beyond in widening circles . Nor should one forget the other Bostons , religious Boston , often earnest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that lived apart . Webster was dead , with Everett and Prescott . George Ticknor , in himself a circle , ignored the Saturday Club . This grand and chilly old scholar , who had written the History of Spanish Literature and whose handsome Georgian mansion faced the State House , belonged to an age that was past and had small interest in present or future . When Howells , venturing into his study , remarked that the Civil War might be good for the South , Ticknor , who was gracious , waived the point and sighed , " Perhaps , perhaps . " The old days , slaves and all , had been good indeed for Ticknor , and , though most of the recent writers who had made Boston famous had been trained in modern languages in his Harvard department , he took no interest in them , their lives , their books , their talk . A more illustrious writer , Francis Parkman , who sometimes appeared at the club , moved in a world of his own for other reasons . An impetuous , active , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keen gray eyes and a military figure , and a chin thrust notably forward , Parkman had wrecked his health in his western adventures , when he tried to live like an Indian , and he had to follow a careful regimen . He was partially crippled by arthritis and partially blind , and he suffered from chronic insomnia and nervous disorders . As long ago as 1849 , he had published The Oregon Trail . Like Dana 's Two Years Before the Mast , this account of his journey across the plains had opened a new world for story-tellers ; and Park-man 's candid , cheerful nature , his martial tastes and his Spartan habits suggested Dana 's traits in many ways . He had written , a few years later , The Conspiracy of Pontiac , and he had been preparing ever since , when he was able to work , for his later series of volumes on the " old French war . " His life had been broken by years of pain and blindness ; but in 1865 , when he was forty-two , he had resumed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prescott , who had shared his physical disabilities , and certainly greater than Motley , whose work , since The Rise of the Dutch Republic , had lost itself in a welter of documents , Parkman was the climax and the crown of the Boston historical school , which was soon to shift its ground and its point of view . The last romantic historian , in a world that was turning scientific , deriving his impulse from Scott as he drew his design from Gibbon , Parkman was a lonely man who stood outside his epoch , an aristocrat , a Stoic and an artist . The other Bostons , aesthetic and " earnest , " were also represented by men who left good books and better talk behind them . The Boston Art Museum had not yet been established , and Norton had tried in vain to interest the town in James Jackson Jarves 's Italian collection . The demand for museums , however , was rapidly rising , and the day had passed when it required courage to hang a painted Venus in the Athenaeum . Even young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this respectable , sir ? " as they opened the door of the reading-room and beheld the casts . No one spoke for this change of feeling better than Thomas G. Appleton , the brother of Longfellow 's wife and the son of a notable manufacturer . This early friend of Motley , with large means and expansive tastes , was a gourmet and also a spiritualist , and a lover of purple and gold and all things edible , visible , touchable , including Persian rugs and downy sofas . A bachelor and a globe-trotter , a yachtsman and a book-collector , " Tom " Appleton was the only man who could ride over Holmes and Lowell and talk them down . There were many who cherished him for this , although Holmes was not among them ; for Appleton got the credit for some of the doctor 's " good things . " His wit was excellent and famous , and he loved all kinds of art and artists , beginning with cooks and ending with Corot and Millet . He encouraged the taste for French art that William @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painter from Vermont , had settled in Boston recently , as the apostolic successor of Copley and Stuart . His portrait of Chief Justice Shaw , which hung in the Salem Court House , had given him this position almost at once ; although Hunt , who was also a landscape-painter , a figure-painter , a painter of horses , for which he had a passionate affection , chafed at the time he wasted on Boston eyebrows . Somebody 's fourteenth cousin was always thinking that his eyebrows should turn up a little more . Hunt radiated an influence like Agassiz 's in science and Ticknor 's in the old days at Harvard ; and " what Hunt said " passed from mouth to mouth , even when he swore like a trooper . In Hunt , in Tom Appleton , even in Dr. Holmes 's talk , the energy of Boston was already following new directions . The old love of learning persisted , with much of the old religious feeling , which the doctor expressed in his hymns ; and the emphasis that was placed upon culture was certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the cause of reform had lost much of their former impulse , and the triumph of the banking interest was accompanied already by a growth of conservative feeling and all things mundane . The solid man of Bouon , A comfortable man , with dividends , And the first salmon , and the first green peas , presided over an Israel at last untroubled . The days of the great crusades were over . The Unitarian movement had spent its force , nor had any cause of equal strength taken the place of Abolition . People who loved goodness had ceased to " adore " it , with the burning heart of the saint who lay in Mount Auburn ; and , ceasing to adore , they ceased to struggle . Emerson , it appeared , was right ? the Unitarians , born Unitarians , had a pale , shallow religion ; and , as Channing had been born something else , so something else was to take his place , as the Catholics rose in power , before Phillips Brooks appeared and the light of an Episcopalian pulpit outshone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But outwardly Channing 's religion was still triumphant . With Theodore Parker out of the picture , the stirring and troublesome Parker , it was even more respectable than ever ; nor were excellent ministers wanting , admirable men , intelligent , humane , with ample hearts . The two great divines were Dr. Clarke and Dr. Hale : James Freeman Clarke , who had studied German literature with Margaret Fuller , and Edward Everett Hale , the author of The Man Without a Country . They represented a liberal faith with few , if any , doctrinal elements that might have been described as ethical culture . Both had been antislavery men , both were experienced writers , both applied their faith to social questions . They were " practical " theologians both . Clarke 's temper was more spiritual , and he was more of a thinker than Hale ; he was also more of the past , as Hale was more of the future . Hale , an exuberant journalist with a touch of genius , wrote more than sixty books . With his large , cheerful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In time he became the " grand old man " of Boston . IV If in these useful characters religious Boston showed , with whatever advances , a falling off , in zeal , in essential energy ? for neither Hale nor Clarke compared with Channing or Parker ? this was true as well in the sphere of reform . The moral passion of the old reformers , those who still survived , had largely lost its aim and its momentum . Wendell Phillips , however , continued to fight for all the new reforms ; and there were others , Miss Peabody , Mrs. Howe and Dr. Howe , the well-known " Cadmus of the blind . " In the good Elizabeth Peabody , the sister-in-law of Hawthorne , whose spectacles were often on her chin , whose bonnet was usually smashed , as if in some fresh encounter with the powers of darkness , while her white hair hung loose , like her opinions ? in the genius of the American kindergarten the passion for justice and progress fermented as ever , though her eyes were faded and strained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was one of the old reformers who never lost her zest , and Julia Ward Howe and Dr. Howe resembled her in this respect . Samuel Gridley Howe had had two careers . As the surgeon-general of the Greek navy , he had played a great part in the revolution in which Byron lost his life . He had fought with the Turks hand to hand , a nineteenth-century Yankee Cervantes , sleeping under the stars with the mountaineers , dressed in snowy chemise and shaggy capote , with only his cloak for a mattress . He had risked his life in Paris in the July revolution , and shared in a Polish revolt , and had later been imprisoned in a Prussian dungeon ; and the fund he had raised for the Cretans had paid for the education of a whole generation of Cretan children . His second career meanwhile had made his name a household word , with the name of his famous pupil , Laura Bridgman . For Dr. Howe , as for Wendell Phillips , the cause of reform was never-ending , nor was it ever to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 61 , working in the army camps , she had driven one afternoon with Dr. Clarke . The soldiers tramped beside the carriage , singing " John Brown 's Body . " Her nerves and her blood were beating with the rhythm when she woke in the middle of the night , and suddenly the words came that Dr. Clarke had asked for and she wrote the " Battle Hymn " in half an hour . If she never reached this pitch again , the " good hope of humanity " was the theme of her life , and for decades and scores of years she sang it and talked it until she became a national institution . As long as Mrs. Howe lived there were always a few apostles left to vindicate the name of earnest Boston . A small , shapeless woman , at present , who had once been exceedingly pretty , with an air of unmistakable distinction , she radiated bonhomie and wisdom . While her hat was often askew , she abounded in wit , and her reddish hair suggested a fiery temper ; but she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling , even as she excelled in common sense . Above all other jewels , she prized plain speaking . In this she resembled another woman , also born in New York , who represented the later Boston as Mrs. Howe represented the earlier . For Mrs. " Jack " Gardner already lived in Beacon Street , where she spent all her mornings in bed , though she was to rise betimes and gather culture in a fashion that astonished even Boston . In those days , a third woman , Mary Baker Eddy , was also to figure largely in the Boston scene . The doctrine of progress in the future was complicated by certain facts of which Dr. Holmes 's Boston was unaware , in the days when Howells surveyed the scene , when the " American Athens " rejoiced in its strength , in its statesmen and historians , wits and poets , all in the pride of security . At present , these complications were remote . Mrs. Stowe had called New England the " seed-bed " of the great republic , adding that its people were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " This still seemed a reasonable statement ! Moreover , if New England was the seed-bed , Boston was the hothouse . There the rarer seedlings came to blossom .
