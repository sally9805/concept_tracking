What 's wrong with the U.S. merchant marine ? After the late President Roosevelt 's " bold and daring " plan for its development was dropped late last year ( for lack of building materials ) , President Truman appointed a committee of five non-shipping men to find a new answer . Last week , after eight months of exhaustive study , the committee reported that the main trouble with the merchant marine was that there just was not enough of it . <P> The committee , headed by K. T. Keller , president of Chrysler Corp. , recommended to the President the immediate adoption of a program to build 46 passenger vessels in the next four years . Two of them would be 50,000-ton express liners of 2,000-passenger capacity , designed to compete with Britain 's Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth . <P> Prospect . Among the other additions would be three large ships for the New York-Mediterranean route , and five round-the-world cruisers . The committee urged that the Government start the program with a flat 50% subsidy of all costs , estimated at some $500 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the war ( e.g. , Liberty ships ) are uneconomical , so the committee asked for the construction of a new fleet of highspeed dry cargo and tanker vessels . But it sensibly warned the U.S. against trying to hog world shipping . Said the committee : " Many maritime nations are far more dependent for income on shipping than is the United States . . . . Any attempt on the part of the United States to monopolize a large part of world shipping . . . could constitute a threat to world peace , " by further impoverishing some nations and drying up world trade . <P> Obstacle . The committee had hard words for the unwieldy , badly organized independent Maritime Commission , " the most serious obstacle standing in the way of the development of the merchant marine . " It proposed dropping the five maritime commissioners in favor of a Maritime Administrator of sub-Cabinet rank , under the Secretary of Commerce , with a Maritime Board to perform the present agency 's legislative and judicial functions . The committee also recommended 1 ) continuation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to revive the nation 's coastwise and intercoastal shipping , through surplus ship sales and the elimination of discriminatory rail rates . <P> As in the case of the Roosevelt plan , tight supplies of materials were likely to pigeonhole the plan , for a while , at least . But before long the U.S. , owner of more obsolete ships than any country except Britain , was going to have to go back to shipbuilding again .
