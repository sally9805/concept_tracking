Toward the end of Walter Winchell 's hot flashes last Sunday night , a familiar voice broke in to read a classified ad . " Situation wanted , male , " announced Henry Morgan . " Young comedian will be unemployed after Dec. 3 . Prospective sponsors please contact Henry Morgan . . . . " <P> Morgan 's break with his sponsors ( Eversharp Schick Injector Razors ) was no great surprise-except to his circle of adoring fans . Since Henry returned to the air from summer vacation , his Hooperating has dipped to a sickly 7.8 , and his scripts have lacked their oldtime bounce . Worse still , the sponsor has complained of not selling as many razor blades . <P> The news was ominous for lesser comics of the Morgan school : all the brash , postwar lads whose specialty is making fun of radio and its sponsors . Things looked far from bright for three of the most prominent members of the toss-it-away brand of comedy : 1 ) come January , the American Tobacco Co. will reportedly drop Jack Paar ( TIME @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lewis ( TIME , June 23 ) is still a liability to CBS , with no sponsor after nearly seven months on the air as a sustainer ; 3 ) Alan Young , the Canadian wit , after starring for over two years on his own program , has been demoted to a supporting role on the Tony Martin show ( TIME , April 14 ) . <P> Morgan had tiffed with sponsors before . Life Savers fired him after the night he accused the company of " mulcting " the public ( " The company drills out the middle of Life Savers " ) . Another time , Sponsor Oh Henry dispensed with him for a Morganatic commercial about their candy bar ( " Feed your children enough Oh Henrys and they 'll get sick . . . " ) . Says Morgan : " I hate the sponsor , I love his product , and I adore his money . "
