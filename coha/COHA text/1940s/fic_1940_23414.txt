NEBRASKA CRANE BY THOMAS WOLFE E train had hurtled like a projectile through its tube beneath the Hudson River to emerge in the dazzling sunlight of a September afternoon , and now it was racing across the flat desolation of the Jersey meadows . George Webber sat by the window and saw the smoldering dumps , the bogs , the blackened factories slide past , and felt that one of the most wonderful things in the world is the experience of being on a train . It is so different from watching a train go by . To anyone outside , a speeding train is a thunderbolt of driving rods , a hot hiss of steam , a blurred flash of coaches , a wall of movement and of noise , a shriek , a wail , and then just emptiness and absence , with a feeling of " There goes everybody ! " without knowing who anybody is . And all of a sudden the watcher feels the vastness and loneliness of America , and the nothingness of all those little lives hurled past upon the immensity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train everything is different . The train itself is a miracle of man 's handiwork , and everything about it is eloquent of human purpose and direction . One feels the brakes go on when the train is coming to a river and one knows that the old gloved hand of cunning is at the throttle . One 's own sense of manhood and of mastery is heightened by being on a train . And all the other people , how real they are ! One sees the fat black porter with his ivory teeth and the great swollen gland on the back of his neck , and one warms with friendship for him . One looks at all the pretty girlswith a sharpened eye and an awakened pulse . One observes all the other passengers with lively interest , and feels that he has known them forever . In the morning most of them will be gone out of his life ; some will drop out silently at night through the dark , drugged snoring of the sleepers ; but now all are caught upon the wing and held for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which has become their common home for a night . At the far end of the car a man stood up and started back down the aisle toward the washroom . He walked with a slight limp and leaned upon a cane , and with his free hand he held onto the backs of the seats to brace himself against the lurching of the train . As he came abreast of George , who sat there gazing out the window , the man stopped abruptly . A strong , good-natured voice , warm , easy , bantering , unafraid , unchanged  --  exactly as it was when it was fourteen years of age  --  broke like a flood of living light upon his consciousness : " Well I 'll be dogged ! Hi , there , Monkus ! Where you goin ' ? " At the sound of the old jesting nickname George looked up quickly . It was Nebraska Crane . The square , freckled , sunburned visage had the same humorous friendliness it had always had , and the tar-black Cherokee eyes looked out with the same straight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they clasped each other firmly . And , instantly , it was like coming home to a strong and friendly place . In an-other moment they were seated together , talking with the familiarity of people whom no gulf of years and distance could alter or separate . George had seen Nebraska Crane only once in all the years since he himself had first left Libya Hill and gone away to college . But he had not lost sight of him . Nobody had lost sight of Nebraska Crane . That wiry , fearless little figure of the Cherokee boy who used to come down the hill on Locust Street with the bat slung over his shoulder and the well-oiled fielder 's mitt protruding from his hip pocket had been prophetic of a greater destiny , for Nebraska had become a professional baseball player , he had crashed into the big leagues , and his name had been emblazoned in the papers every day . The newspapers had had a lot to do with his seeing Nebraska that other time . It was in August , 1925 , just after George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That very night , in fact , a little before midnight , as he was seated in a Childs Restaurant with smoking wheatcakes , coffee , and an ink-fresh copy of next morning 's Herald Tribune before him , the headline jumped out at him : " Crane Slams Another Homer . " He read the account of the game eagerly and felt a strong desire to see Nebraska again and to get back in his blood once more the honest tang of America . Acting on a sudden impulse , he decided to call him up . Sure enough , his name was in the book , with an address way up in the Bronx . He gave the number and waited . A man 's voice answered the ' phone , but at first he did n't recognize it . " Hello ! . . . Hello ! . . Is Mr. Crane there ? . . Is that you , Bras ? " " Hello . " Nebraska 's voice was hesitant , slow , a little hostile , touched with the caution and suspicion of mountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ? . . Who ? . . . Is that you , Monk ? " ? suddenly and quickly , as he recognized who it was . " Well I 'll be dogged ! " he cried . His tone was delighted , astounded , warm with friendly greeting now , and had the somewhat high and faintly howling quality that mountain people 's voices often have when they are talking to someone over the telephone : the tone was full , sonorous , countrified , and a little puzzled , as if he were yelling to someone on an adjoining mountain peak on a gusty day in autumn when the wind was thrashing through the trees . " Where 'd you come from ? How the hell are you , boy ? " he yelled before George could answer . " Where you been all this time , anyway ? " " I 've been in Europe . I just got back this morning . " " Well I 'll be dogged ! " ? still astounded , delighted , full of howling friendliness . " When am I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the game tomorrow ? I 'll fix you up . And say , " he went on rapidly , " if you can stick aroun ' after the game , I 'll take you home to meet the wife and kid . How about it ? " So it was agreed . George went to the game and saw Nebraska knock another home run , but he remembered best what happened afterward . When the player had had his shower and had dressed , the two friends left the ball park , and as they went out a crowd of young boys who had been waiting at the gate rushed upon them . They were those dark-faced , dark-eyed , dark-haired little urchins who spring up like dragon 's teeth from the grim pavements of New York , but in whose tough little faces and raucous voices there still remains , curiously , the innocence and faith of children everywhere . " It 's Bras ! " the children cried . " Hi , Bras ! Hey , Bras ! " In a moment they were pressing round him in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , begging , shouting , tugging at his sleeves , doing everything they could to attract his attention , holding dirty little scraps of paper toward him , stubs of pencils , battered little notebooks , asking him to sign his autograph . He behaved with the spontaneous warmth and kindliness of his character . He scrawled his name out rapidly on a dozen grimy bits of paper , skillfully working his way along through the yelling , pushing , jumping group , and all the time keeping up a rapid fire of banter , badinage , and good-natured reproof : " All right  --  give it here , then ! . . Why do n't you fellahs pick on somebody else once in a while ? . . Say , boy ! " he said suddenly , turning to look down at one unfortunate child , and pointing an accusing finger at him ? " What you doin ' aroun ' here again to-day ? I signed my name for you at least a dozen times ! " " No sir , Misteh Crane ! " the urchin earnestly replied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't that right ? " Nebraska said , appealing to the other children . " Do n't this boy keep cumin ' back here every day ? " They grinned , delighted at the chagrin of their fellow-petitioner . " Dat 's right , Misteh Crane ! Dat guy 's got a whole book wit ' nuttin ' but yoeh name in it ! " " Ah-h ! " the victim cried , and turned upon his betrayers bitterly . " What youse guys tryin ' to do  --  get wise or somep'n ? Honest , Misteh Crane ! " ? he looked up earnestly again at Nebraska ? " Do n't believe ' em ! I jest want yoeh ottygraph ! Please , Misteh Crane , it 'll only take a minute ! " For a moment more Nebraska stood looking down at the child with an expression of mock sternness ; at last he took the outstretched notebook , rapidly scratched his name across a page , and handed it back . And as he did so he put his big paw on the urchin 's head and gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he shoved it from him and walked off down the street . The apartment where Nebraska lived was like a hundred thousand others in the Bronx . The ugly yellow-brick building had a false front , with meaningless little turrets at the corners of the roof , and a general air of spurious luxury about it . The rooms were rather small and cramped , and were made even more so by the heavy , overstuffed Grand Rapids furniture . The walls of the living room , painted a mottled , rusty cream , were bare except for a couple of sentimental colored prints , while the place of honor over the mantel was reserved for an enlarged and garishly tinted photograph of Nebraska 's little son at the age of two , looking straight and solemnly out at all corners from a gilded oval frame . Myrtle , Nebraska 's wife , was small and plump , and pretty in a doll-like way . Her corn-silk hair was frizzled in a halo about her face and her chubby features were heavily accented by rouge and lipstick . But she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and George liked her at once . She welcomed him with a warm and friendly smile and said she had heard a lot about him . They all sat down . The child , who was three or four years old by this time , and who had been shy , holding on to his mother 's dress and peeping out from behind her , now ran across the room to his father and began climbing all over him . Nebraska and Myrtle asked George a lot of questions about himself , what he had been doing , where he had been , and especially what countries he had visited in Europe . They seemed to think of Europe as a place so far away that anyone who had actually been there was touched with an unbelievable aura of strangeness and romance . " Whereall did you go over there , anyway ? " asked Nebraska . " Oh , everywhere , Bras , " George said ? " France , England , Holland , Germany , Denmark , Sweden , Italy  --  all over the place . " " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You sure do git aroun ' , do n't you ? " " Not the way you do , Bras . You 're traveling most of the time . " " Who  --  rne ? Oh , hell , I do n't git anywhere  --  just the same ole places . Chicago , St. Looie , Philly  --  I seen ' em all so often I could find my way blindfolded ! " He waved them aside with a gesture of his hand . Then suddenly he looked at George as though he were just seeing him for the first time , and he reached over and slapped him on the knee and exclaimed : " Well be dogged ! How you Join ' , anyway , Monkus ? " " Oh , ca n't complain . How about you ? But I do n't need to ask that . I 've been reading all about you in the papers . " " Yes , Monkus , " he said . " I been havin ' a good year . But , boy ! " ? he shook his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel it ! " He was silent a moment , then he went on quietly : " I been up here since 1919 ? that 's seven years , and it 's a long time in this game . Not many of ' em stay much longer . When you been shaggin ' flies as long as that you may lose count , but you do n't need to count  --  your legs 'll tell you . " " But , good Lord , Bras , you 're all right ! Why , the way you got around out there to-day you looked like a colt ! " " Yeah , " Nebraska said , " maybe I looked like a colt , but I felt like a plow horse . " He fell silent again , then he tapped his friend gently on the knee with his brown hand and said abruptly : " No , Monkus . When you been in this business as long as I have , you know it . " " Oh , come on , Bras , quit your kidding ! " said George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than himself . " You 're still a young man . Why , you 're only twenty-seven ! " " Sure , sure , " Nebraska answered quietly . " But it 's like I say . You ca n't stay in this business much longer than I have . Of course Cobb an ' Speaker an ' a few like that  --  they was up here a long time . But eight years is about the average , an ' I been here seven already . So if I can hang on a few years more , I wo n't have no kick to make . . .. Hell ! " he said in a moment , with the old hearty ring in his voice , " I ai n't got no kick to make , no-way . If I got my release to-morrow , I 'd still feel I done all right . . . . Ai n't that so , Buzz ? " he cried genially to the child , who had settled down on his knee , at the same time seizing the boy and cradling him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done all right , ai n't he ? " " That 's the way me an ' Bras feel about it , " remarked Myrtle , who during this conversation had been rocking back and forth , placidly ruminating on a wad of gum . " Along there last year it looked once or twice as if Bras might git traded . He said to me one day before the game , Well , ole lady , if I do n't git some hits to-day somethin ' tells me you an ' me is goin ' to take a trip . ' So I says , ' Trip where ? ' An ' he says , ' I do n't know , but they 're goin ' to sell me down the river if I do n't git gain ' , an ' somethin ' tells me it 's now or never ! ' So I just looks at him , " continued Myrtle placidly , " an ' I says , ' Well , what do you want me to do ? Do you want me to come to-day or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't let me come when he ai n't hittin ' he says it 's bad luck . But he just looks at me a minute , an ' I can see him sort of studyin ' it over , an ' all of a sudden he makes up his mind an ' says , ' Yes , come on if you want to ; I could n't have no more bad luck than I been havin ' , no-way , an ' maybe it 's come time fer things to change , so you come on . ' Well , I went  --  an ' I do n't know whether I brought him luck or not , but somethin ' did , " said Myrtle , rocking in her chair complacently . " Dogged if she did n't ! " Nebraska chuckled . " I got three hits out of four times up that day , an ' two of ' em was home runs ! " " Yeah , " Myrtle agreed , " an ' that Philadelphia fast-ball thrower was throw-in ' ' em too . " " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " went on Myrtle , chewing placidly , " because I heard some of the boys say later that it was like he was throwin " em up there from out of the bleachers , with all them men in shirtsleeves right behind him , an ' the boys said half the time they could n't even see the ball . But Bras must of saw it  --  or been lucky  --  because he hit two home runs off of him , an ' that pitcher did n't like it either . The second one Bras got , he 4660110041 w/0040*.wiri went stompin ' an ' tearin ' around out there like a wild bull . He sure did look mad , " said Myrtle in her customary placid tone . " Maddest man I ever seen ! " Nebraska cried delightedly . " I thought he was goin ' to dig a hole plumb through to China . . . . But that 's the way it was . She 's right about it . That was the day I got goin ' . I know one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says , ' we all thought you was goin ' to take a ride , but you sure dug in , did n't you ? ' That 's the way it is in this game . I seen Babe Ruth go fer weeks when he could n't hit a balloon , an ' all of a sudden he lams into it . Seems like he just cai n't miss from then on . " All this had happened four years ago . Now the two friends had met again , and were seated side by side in the speeding train , talking and catching up on each other . Nebraska 's right ankle was taped and bandaged ; a heavy cane rested between his knees . George asked him what had happened . " I pulled a tendon , " Nebraska said , " an ' got laid off . So I thought I might as well run down an ' see the folks . Myrtle , she could n't come  --  the kid 's got to git ready fer school . " " How are they ? " George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wool an ' a yard wide , both of ' em ! " He was silent for a moment , then he looked at his friend with a tolerant Cherokee grin and said : " But I 'm crackin ' up , Monkus . Guess I cai n't stan ' the gaff much more . " The quiet resignation of the player touched his friend with sadness . It was hard and painful for him to face the fact that this strong and fearless creature , who had stood in his life always for courage and for victory , should now be speaking with such ready acceptance of defeat . " But , Bras , " he protested , " you 've been hitting just as well this season as you ever did ! I 've read about you in the papers , and the reporters have all said the same thing . " " Oh , I can still hit ' em , " Nebraska quietly agreed . " It ai n't the hittin ' that bothers me . That 's the Last thing you lose anyway . Leastways , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an ' I talked to other fellahs who said it was that way with them . " After a pause he went on in a low tone : " If this ole leg heals up in time I 'll go on back an ' git in the game again an ' finish out the season . An ' if I 'm lucky maybe they 'll keep me on a couple more years , because they know I can still hit . But , hell , " he added quietly , " they know I 'm through . They already got me all tied up with string . " As Nebraska talked , George saw that the Cherokee in him was the same now as it had been when he was a boy . His cheerful fatalism had always been the source of his great strength and courage . That was why he had never been afraid of anything , not even death . But , seeing the look of regret on George 's face , Nebraska smiled again and went on lightly : " That 's the way it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you 're good . After that they sell you down the river . Hell , I ai n't kickin ' . I been lucky . I had ten years of it already , an ' that 's more than most . An ' I been in three World 's Series . If I can hold on fer another year or two  --  if they do n't let me go or trade me  --  I think maybe we 'll be in again . Me an ' Myrtle has figgered it all out . I had to help her people some , an ' I bought a farm fer Mama an ' the Ole Man  --  that 's where they always wanted to be . An ' I got three hundred acres of my own in Zebulon  --  all paid fer too ! - an ' if I git a good price this year fer my tobacco , I stan ' to clear two thousand dollars . So if I can git two years more in the League an ' one more good World 's Series , why " he turned his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freckled grin , just as he used to as a boy ? " we 'll be all set . " " And  --  you mean you 'll be satisfied ? " " Huh ? Satisfied ? " Nebraska turned to him with a puzzled look . " How do you mean ? " " I mean after all you 've seen and done , Bras  --  the big cities and the crowds , and all the people shouting  --  and the newspapers , and the headlines , and the World 's Series  --  and  --  and  --  the first of March , and St. Petersburg , and meeting all the fellows again , and spring training ? " Nebraska groaned . " Why , what 's the matter ? " " Spring trainin ' . " " You mean you do n't like it ? " " Like it ! Them first three weeks is just plain hell . It ai n't bad when you 're a kid . You do n't put on much weight durin ' the winter , an ' when you come down in the spring it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ git the kinks out . In two weeks ' time you 're loose as ashes . But wait till you been aroun ' as long as I have ! " He laughed loudly and shook his head . " Boy ! The first time you go after a grounder you can hear your joints creak . After a while you begin to limber up  --  you work into it an ' git the soreness out of your muscles . By the time the season starts , along in April , you feel pretty good . By May you 're goin ' like a house a-fire , an ' you tell yourself you 're good as you ever was . You 're still gain ' strong along in June . An ' then you hit July , an ' you git them double-headers in St. Looie ! Boy , oh boy ! " Again he shook his head and laughed , baring big square teeth . " Monlms , " , he said quietly , turning to his companion , and now his face was serious and he had his black Indian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ July ? " " No . " " All right then , " he said very softly and scornfully . " An ' you ai n't played ball there in July . You come up to bat with sweat bustin ' from your ears . You step up an ' look out there to where the pitcher ought to be , an ' you see four of him . The crowd in the bleachers is out their roastin ' in their shirtsleeves , an ' when the pitcher throws the ball it just comes from nowheres  --  it comes right out of all them shirtsleeves in the bleachers . It 's on top of you before you know MAGAZINE it . Well , anyway , you dig in an ' git a toe-hold , take your cut , an ' maybe you connect . You straighten out a fast one . It 's good fer two bases if you hustle . In the old days you could 've made it standin ' up . But now  --  boy ! " He shook his head slowly . " You cai n't tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in July ! They got it all growed out in grass in April , but after July first ? " he gave a short laugh ? " hell ! it 's paved with concrete ! An ' when you git to first , them dogs is sayin ' , ' Boy , let 's stay here ! ' But you got ta keep on goin ' ? you know the manager is watchin ' you  --  you 're gon na ketch hell if you do n't take that extra base , it may mean the game . An ' the boys up in the press box , they got their eyes glued on you too ? they 've begun to say old Crane is playin ' on a dime  --  an ' you 're thinkin ' about next year an ' maybe gittin ' in another Series  --  an ' you hope to God you do n't git traded to St. Looie . So you take it on the lam , you slide into second like the Twentieth Century comin ' into the Chicago yards  --  an ' when you git @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any of your parts is missin ' , you got ta listen to one of that second baseman 's wisecracks : ' What 's the hurry , Bras ? Afraid you 'll be late fer the Veterans ' Reunion ? ' " " I begin to see what you mean all right , " said George . " See what I mean ? Why , say ! One day this season I ast one of the boys what month it was , an ' whcn he told me it was just the middle of July , I says to him : ' July , hell ! If it ai n't September I 'll eat your hat ! " Go ahead then , ' he says , an ' eat it , because it ai n't September , Bras  --  it 's July . ' Well , ' I says , ' they must be havin ' sixty days a month this year  --  it 's the longest damn July I ever felt ! ' An ' femme tell you , I did n't miss it fer tither -- -I 'll be dogged if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it may be only July , but you think it 's September . " He was silent for a moment . " But they 'll keep you in there , generly , as Iong as you can hit . If you can smack that ale apple they 'll send you out there if they 've got to use glue to keep you from fallin ' apart . So maybe I 'll git in another year or two if I 'm lucky . So long 's I can hit ' em , maybe they 'll keep sendin ' me out there till all the other players has to grunt every time ole Bras goes after a ground ball ! " He laughed . " I ai n't that bad yet , but soon 's I am , I 'm through . " " You wo n't mind it then when you have to quit ? " He did n't answer at once . He sat there looking out the window . Then he laughed a little wearily : " Boy , this may be a ride on the train to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this stretch so often that I can tell you what telephone post we 're passin ' without even lookin ' out the window . Why , hell yes ! " ? he laughed loudly now , in the old infectious way ? " I used to have ' em numbered  --  now I got ' em named ! " " And you think you can get used to spending all your time out on the farm in Zebulon ? " " Git used to it ? " In Nebraska 's voice there was now the same note of scornful protest that it had when he was a boy , and for a moment he turned and looked at his friend with an expression of astonished disgust . " Why , what are you talkin ' about ? That 's the greatest life in the world ! " " And your father ? How is he , Bras ? " The player grinned and shook his head : " Oh , the Ole Man 's happy as a possum . He 's doin ' what he wanted to do all his life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If he felt any better he 'd have to go to bed . Strong as a bull , " said Nebraska proudly . " He could A  --  rastle a bear right now an ' bite his nose off ! Why , hell yes ! " the player went on with an air of conviction ? " he could take any two men I know to-day an ' throw ' cm over his shoulder ! " " Bras , do you remember when you and I were kids and your father was on thepolice force , how he used to wrestle all those professionals that came to town ? There were some good ones too ! " " You 're damn right there was ! " said the player , nodding his head . " Tom Anderson , who used to be South Atlantic champion , an ' that fellah Petersen  --  do you remember him ? " " Sure . And that big fellow they called the Strangler Turk ? " " Yeah , an ' he was good too ! Only he was n't no Turk  --  he only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was some kind of Polack from the steel mills , an ' that 's how he got so strong . " " And Bull Dakota  --  and Texas Jim Ryan  --  and the Masked Marvel ? Do you remember the Masked Marvel ? " " Yeah  --  only there was a whole lot of them  --  guys cruisin ' all over the country callin ' theirselves the Masked Marvel . The Ole Man wrastled two of ' em . Only the real Masked Marvel never came to town . The Old Man told me there was a real Masked Marvel , but he was too damn good , I guess , to come to Libya Hilt . " " Do you remember the night , Bras , when your father was wrestling one of these Masked Marvels , and we were there in the front row rooting for him , and he got a stranglehold on this fellow with the mask , and the mask came off  --  and the fellow was n't the Masked Marvel at all , but only that Greek who used to work all night at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Yeah  --  haw-haw ! " Nebraska threw back his head and laughed loudly . " I 'd clean fergot that damn Greek , but that 's who it was ! The whole crowd hollered frame-up an ' tried to git their money hack. ? I 'll swear , Monk ! I 'm glad to see you ! " He put his big hand on his companion 's knee . " It do n't seem no time , does it ? It all comes back ! " " Yes , Bras ? " for a moment George looked out at the flashing landscape with a feeling of sadness and wonder in his heart ? " it all comes back . " A
