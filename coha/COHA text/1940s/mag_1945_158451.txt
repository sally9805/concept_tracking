The reconversion plan for U.S. industry after V-E day was formally unwrapped last week . Home Front Czar Jimmy Byrnes had given businessmen a good peek at it when he turned over his job to Fred Vinson fortnight ago , but he left it up to WPBoss Julius A. Krug to take off all the wraps . In so doing , WPBoss Krug optimistically predicted that a year after Germany quits , the U.S. will be turning out as many refrigerators , stoves and possibly autos - and all other consumers ' goods - as it did in 1939 . <P> WPB 's reconversion blueprint calls for these steps : <P> A cutback of 12% in war production in the first quarter after V-E day . <P> An additional cutback of 8% in the second quarter . <P> Another cutback of 15% in the last two quarters . <P> Thus , by the end of the first year , even though the Japanese war is still on , industry can count on a minimum cutback of 35% in war production . <P> To speed things up , WPB @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry . Eventually it will drop it in favor of a simple system of priorities , controlling only such materials as are needed for the Jap war . <P> In short , WPB will take its hands off a big chunk of U.S. industry , free enough materials so that it can make what it wants . Only on scarce materials , such as rubber , tin , textiles and lumber , will WPB keep a tight hold . <P> First a Trickle . The cutbacks are approximately the same as WPB tentatively set a month ago ( TIME , March 19 ) . Big though they seem , they will bring only a tantalizing trickle of civilian goods at the start . The reason : WPB will first shore up the civilian economy at some of its dangerously weak spots , due chiefly to the shortage of railroad rolling stock and agricultural equipment . <P> The 1,500,000 tons of carbon steel , which the first V-E cutbacks will release , will be almost all chewed up filling these needs . <P> What is left will go for a sprinkling of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , blood banks , etc. ) , and machine tools needed for the overall reconversion job . <P> At first , WPB expects to keep a checkrein on reconversion , to make sure that civilians get what they need most . <P> But by six months after V-E day , WPB hopes that there will be enough materials and manpower available so that the gen eral run of industries can reconvert as they please , let supply and demand govern output . <P> Cars When ? Two days after WPBoss Krug let out his plan , he hustled to Detroit . There he conferred with automen on plans to reconvert the auto industry , biggest job of all . <P> To help matters , he named young ( 37 ) International Harvester executive-on-leave Henry P. Nelson , boss of WPB 's aircraft division , to head a special " task force , " which will recommend to WPB ways to 1 ) help the industry clear its plants of Government-owned equipment , 2 ) juggle contracts so that all will get off to the same start on reconversion , 3 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that autos can be turned out quicker .
