When Cab Galloway first heard Toni Harper , he paid her the highest compliment in the Galloway scale . " That little gal , " said he solemnly , " is real gone . " <P> However real she is gone , Toni Harper is obviously going further . A dreamy , fidgety little girl of ten , Toni is one of Hollywood 's about-to-be-discovered wonders . Columbia Records will shortly release her first two records , and last week she was signed up for a Hollywood musical . <P> When she patters to the center of a stage , smooths down her dress , poises her small hands like a tiny coffee-colored ballerina , and starts out on a husky , whispery ballad , she seems only a step away from being a Maxine Sullivan or an Ella Fitzgerald . In the records she has made for Columbia , the words sound like jived-up Mother Goose . Sample : <P> I 'm nine years old but I 'll soon , be twenty-four . I 'm nine years old but I 'll soon be twenty-four . The man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . <P> The words were written specially for her , to an old blues tune , * but otherwise the musicians make no concessions to her age . Toni does n't need any . Her breathy voice is grownup , her phrasing fresh , and her rhythm as good as if she had been singing since the birth of the blues . <P> Toni got her rhythm naturally . Her mother was once in the Cotton Club chorus , has always wanted her kids in show business . And her father , a redcap at Los Angeles ' Union Station , owns a roomful of hot records-Ella Fitzgerald , Duke Ellington , Louis Jordan . " Daddy likes to riff , " says Toni sternly . " ' Sometimes he keeps us awake all night . " But two years ago , Toni began riffing , too . <P> One day , M-G-M Dance Director Nick Castle , who runs a school for professional children on the side , heard her improvising on Waitin ' for the Train to Come In . He gave her a part in a Christmas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared in stage shows with Cab Galloway and a broadcast with Eddie Cantor . <P> Between shows and trips to the studio , Toni likes to skip rope , ride bicycles , and listen to the Lone Ranger . She is not much impressed by her singing and is cool when her father insists on playing her records for visitors ( " I just like to sing . It sounds pretty to me , that 's all " ) . At school , where she always gets As or Bs , no one else is much impressed either . Since she tends to syncopate even her school songs , her teachers do n't ask her to sing solo . But Toni does n't care . " School songs , " says she , " is corny . " <P> <P> *Sent for You Yesterday , Here You Come Today .
