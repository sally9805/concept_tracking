Allison said that the 68-year-old Negro died from internal injuries and shock . The accident occurred just south of the Franklinton line , which is about twenty miles north of Raleigh on U. S.

Scott , who was riding with him , was slightly injured . Scott said he was accompanying Johnson to New York from Texas , where the former champion had concluded a personal appearance tour . He explained that tor several years such appearances had been Johnson 's sole occupation . Both Johnson and Scott were thrown out of the car , which was demolished . They were taken to the hospital , where Johnson died at 6:10 P. M. Johnson 's wife , Mrs. Irene Johnson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming to Raleigh , Scott said . Funeral arrangements have not been made . Death ended a strange career when it took Jack Johnson-4 mad-cap existence that touched the heights , hit the depths and lingered at intermediate points in the scale . One of the craftiest boxers known to the ring , recognized by many as one of the five outstanding heavyweight champions of all time , Jack Johnson lived in the lap lof luxury , abused the fame and // fortune that came to him , and died bereft of riches . ' . Since 1937 he had lectured at Hubert 's ** 228 West Fortysecond Street , once a year or oftener , disregarding gibes that he was competing with the flea circus , and finished his last engagement there only three weeks ago . Friends who saw him recently said that he drove his own car , was well dressed , had an apartment in Chicago and had tried unsuccessfully to find one in New York . At the height of his career Johnson wore diamonds . His " golden smile " revealed a mouth full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half a dozen automobiles when they were a luxury . He shook hands with royalty as he traveled the world over with a retinue of servants . He was involved in a sensational court trial which ended in his conviction on a charge of violation of the Mann Act . He fled justice , roamed the world , a man without a country , until his fortune was gone . He confessed " faking " a fight , a battle in which he admitted he let his title pass to Jess Willard in Havana in 1915 . Got $120,000 in 1910 Among the distinctions that came to him was that of having collected the largest purse ever paid a boxer until the golden era of the Jack Dempsey days -- $120,000 he received in 1910 when he knocked out James J. Jeffries in fourteen rounds at Reno , Nev . For this bout Johnson collected 60 per cent of the purse of $101,000 , $10,000 as a bonus and $50,000 for his share of motion pictures . He was the cause of the " white hope " craze that swept the country after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being brought out of retirement " to bring the title back to the white race . " The result of that fight brought a ban on interstate commerce of motion pictures of fights . Also on the result came riots in different sections of the country which resulted in eight deaths and injuries to many . Johnson was arrested many times for minor law violations . He exhausted his supply of money while a fugitive in foreign lands . He came back after seven years and ser - ed a one-year jail sentence for his Mann Act violation , tried fighting again and failed , made a precarious living as evangelist , spear-carrier in opera and a maker of personal appearances at museums and carnivals . Out of the wealth of his ring experience he predicted that Max Schmeling would knock out Joe Louis and Schmeling won by a knockout , Known as " Li'l Arthur " John Arthur Johnson was his name . He was also known as " Li'l Arthur . " He was born in Galveston , Tex. , March 31 , 1878 . He was one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ righthand uppercut that was his greatest weapon of attack and defense . None has been seen like it in a heavyweight since his day . With Johnson , too , the art of feinting , parrying , leading an opponent into mechanical mistakes , drawing a foe out  --  all this passed , as it was known to the ring of another day and age . Usually supposed to have been discovered by Sam Fitzpatrick , who had managed Peter Jackson and Kid Lavigne , Johnson was discovered instead by Leo Posner , leader of the Galveston Athletic Club , quite by accident . It ' was later in his career that Fitzpatrick signed as manager of Johnson . and as heavyweight champion the Galveston Negro led his manager many a merry chase . Charley Brooks , who spent much time in Galveston gymnasiums , introduced Johnson to Posner at a time , when ring talent was scarce in Galveston . The test of the new . comer was made by Brooks , who was looking for an easy foe . Brooks was knocked out in the trial , for which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's ring career was launched . Won 8ix Fights in 1901 In. 1901 he ' won six bouts , one of them a two-roulid knockout of Brooks , and fotxht a draw , until he undertook . a ? clash with Joe Choynski , known , in ring history as a great boxer . Choynski knocked out Johnson . in three rounds , but the setback was temporary . Choynski took an - interest in Johnson when they ; were jailed as a consequence of the battle , and undertook a course of instruction which started in the jail yard and formed the foundation of the ring development of Johnson . In 1902 Johnson started a campaign in which he lost only three bouts in six years . He lost a twenty-round decision to Hank Griffin in 1902 , another to Marvin Hart in 1905 and in the same year lost on a foul to Joe Jeanette in two rounds . He was fighting all over the country , against whatever opposition was presented , and his engagements included bouts with Sam , Sandy Ferguson , Sam Langford , as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; round of their bout in Boston in 1906 Langford , hardly more than a welterweight , knocked Johnson down with a left hook early in the fight and Johnson , profiting by a count that was none too accurate , survived by calling upon all his consummate defensive boxing skill . They never fought again . Johnson 's 1907 victories included a two-round knockout of Bob Fitzsimmons , but the Cornishman at the time was at the end of his pugilistic ' tamer . This consistent campaign established Johnson as a title threat at i3 , time when Tommy Burns was wecognized as a champion . Burns ; shied away from a meeting , but Johnson pressed his challenge until ; he finally got a match with Burns in Sydney , Australia , and there ; pounded Burns to such an extent that police stopped the fight in the fourteenth round , giving Johnson claim to the title . Johnson 's next battle of note , aside from a six-round no-decision ; affair with Philadelphia Jack ; O'Brien , was a twelve-round knockout of Stanley Ketchel , world mid ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This was an ill-fated undertaking by the smaller Ketchel , who , : nevertheless pressed Johnson hard at times before being knocked out . It was also the last bout for Johnson before he knocked out Jeffries in the fifteenth round on July 4 , 1910 , in Reno , a contest pro ; noted by Tex Rickard and Jack , Gleason that drew an unpre-1 cedented $270,775 in receipts . Beset By Difficulties After that bout , his claim to the title undisputed since he had , ' knocked out the man who had gone into retirement as champion , John , son came upon difficulties . He married two white women . One of them committed suicide in a room above his Cafe de Champion in Chicago . The other he married while she was being interrogated as the Government 's chief witness in prosecution of charges that Johnson violated the Mann Act in transporting her from Pittsburgh to Chicago . The champion was found guilty , was released from jail , pending sentence , on $30,000 bond , was sentenced to a year in jail , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Canada as a member of a Negro baseball team , leaving Chicago after a game . He sailed from Montreal and arrived in Havre on the morning of July 10 , 1913 , as a fugitive . For seven years Johnson fought an foreign soil . Barred from music halls of London , he subsequently was expelled from the country . He fought three bouts in Paris in 1913 , beating Frank Moran , Al Sproul and Jim Johnson . In 1915 he went to Havana , where he was knocked out in twenty-six rounds by Willard , a bout for which Johnson later said he was promised , but never collected , $50,000 for " laying down . " Gradually Johnson disappeared from the picture thereafter , fighting in Spain for the most part until in 1919 he went to Mexico City to win a fight from Capt . Bob Roper . In 1920 he arranged for his surrender to Federal marshals who awaited him as he stepped across the border . Old and fleshy when he emerged from Leavenworth prison , Johnson intermittently undertook a ring come-back thereafter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Bob Lawson knocked him out in seven rounds of a scheduled twelve-round bout at Juarez , Mexico . He finally retired from the ring in 1928 after a six-round bout with Bill Hartwell in Kansas City .
