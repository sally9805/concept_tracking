Russia 's Andrei Vishinsky was all unaccustomed smiles , good humor and friendliness during the first three days of the Big Four meeting in Paris . The mood carried over into the working week 's one big social interlude-a state dinner given by French President Vincent Auriol for 40 top delegates and their wives . A military quartet played Debussy . Everybody wore evening clothes except Vishinsky , who showed up in a dark blue lounge suit . One of his aides apologized : " We worked so hard up to the last minute , the Minister had time only to change his shirt . We are always working , you know . In that respect we live on a plane different from that of you Westerners . " <P> The Maximum . The different planes from which West and East looked down on Germany became more evident as the week wore on . The courtesy wilted steadily . By Thursday night the talks had reached the level of restrained acerbity . The three Western powers were asking Russia to quit stalling and tell precisely what it wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition for lifting the Berlin blockade . Vishinsky was snapping back that no one could " impose " on him any topics of discussion . <P> The Western delegates believed that Russia was pursuing the tactic of a maximum , impossible demand at the outset . Vishinsky wanted : 1 ) re-establishment of a four-power Control Council to exercise " supreme power " in Germany ; 2 ) re-establishment of the Inter-Allied Kommandatura in Berlin ; 3 ) creation of an " All-German State Council " ; and 4 ) reestablishment of the All-Berlin Magistrat . <P> Clearly this meant trying to revive the corpse of the Potsdam agreement . U.S. Secretary of State Acheson called it " turning the clock back . " French Foreign Minister Schuman said it would mean " returning to the point where our paths diverged . . . whereas what we are trying to do is find a point where our paths can converge again . " Vishinsky retorted : " Until the peace treaty , Allied control of Germany must be as inevitable as the sun . You can not prevent the sun from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can not return to the dawn once the sun has risen . " <P> The Minimum . The Western delegates had no intention of losing what had been gained in Germany . German unity , they insisted , must come within the democratic framework of the Bonn constitution ( see FOREIGN NEWS ) . <P> The West was not sanguine that Russia would accept this position . It expected no dramatic general settlement . But it felt reasonably sure that the Russians wanted a limited agreement . If so , at what point ? <P> <P> The West suspected that the point was economic . The Allied counter-blockade had hurt Russian-controlled East Germany and East Europe more than the Soviet blockade of Berlin had hurt the West . Therefore Moscow wanted to resume trade between Eastern and Western zones .
