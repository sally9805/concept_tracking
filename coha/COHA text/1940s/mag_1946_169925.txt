Hard-drinking Haligonians have long beefed about the Government 's method of selling liquor and beer . They had to pay 50 for a permit , had to wait in slow-moving queues at one of the four Government retail stores . If they were lucky , they got four quarts a month of Canadian rye or gin , or two of imported liquors . Attached to each bottle was an admonition to take it straight home . <P> Ofttimes Haligonians took more devious routes to get a drink . They dropped in at smelly , slummy Grafton Street dives for a quick and illegal snort , or paid bootleggers anywhere from $8 to $20 for straight-from-the-still " Tiger Sweat . " <P> Two months ago they decided to do something about this semi-prohibition . Result : a ding-dong wet-dry battle . Headed by Mayor Allan M. Butler , the wets supported a plebiscite calling upon the Nova Scotian Government to permit establishment of taverns which would sell beer and liquor by the glass . Last week Haligonians voted for taverns , 2-to-1.        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
