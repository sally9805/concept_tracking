txt Miners in the Klondike field are n't going back to work just yet . It may take more than the power of government to get them back . John L. Lewis himself might not be able to turn the trick . After nearly four weeks of idleness , his men hereabouts have their belts tightened for a long siege . John Ozanich , president of the United Mine Workers ' local at the world 's biggest coal mine , stood in the back yard of his twostory green and red house . He puffed slowly on his pipe and nodded to the school children who ran by , taking a shortcut to their homes farther up the hill . One of John 's five daughters spaded the good black soil , and John said : " If Mr. Lewis sent a telegram tonight and the dispute ( over pension payments ) was not settled , we would n't go back . " Meanwhile , America 's industry was slowing production as strike effects mounted . Washington ordered coalpowered rail transport cut to half of normal . Story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Ozanich home is the Ronco baseball diamond . Young miners in their red and black checkered hunting caps took their cuts at the ball and ran the bases Others stood by . watching . In deep center . a bulldozer moved relentlessly leveling the bumps from the field . The machine had been sent over that morning by the H. C. Frick Coke Co , the big coal mining subsidiary of U. S. Steel Corp . The Frick mines have n't worked now since March 15 . Nor have the Frick miners , who made up most of the gathering at the ball diamond But the miners did n't seem to mind . A tall boyish miner with a peach face spoke up : " Do we look worried ? " Look at us . We 're playing ball . Some of the boys are fixing their houses . Some are out fishing . And others are digging their gardens  --  and that ai n't coal . " The other miners who were standing around laughed when he said that . Frank Boskovich , a union official . was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . " he said . " They 're pinched a little , but they see a time when they get something to look forward to , and when a man can hold his head up . " No doubt everybody wants to go back , but whatever John L. does we 're 100,7 , - behind him . " Frank is a committeeman at the Robena mine of H. C. Frick Coke Co . That 's the same local which John Ozanich heads . Robena is the world 's largest mine . It produces 14.000 tons of coal daily and employs 2.400 men . The Pemer of Robena Because it is such a large mine . Robena works a powerful influence on the other mines of the Klondike field . Its miners usually are the first to go out when trouble brews . When they decide to go back , others follow . The Robena union leaders say there is no talk now of a back-to-work movement . Certainly , an outsider does n't run into much return-to-work talk . " Naturally you wouldn't. " said a man at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's no one wanting to buck the organization . " But , hell . Lewis took them out too early this time . They got a contract coming up in June and they may be out then , too . Believe me. they 're thinking of that . Walk down the street here and talk to them and they 'll tell you . That is , if they know you . If they do n't , well ? ? " At Carmichaels , which is about a halfdozen miles from here , the young miner drinking beer at the bar summed up in a few words the sentiment you find wherever you go in the coal fields . " A lot of the men want to go back and a lot don't. " he said . " Myself . I 'd like to go hack and there are others who think about the same . But you ca n't do anything about it until all the rest do . I think we 're all going to stay out , even though some do n't want to . " This miner lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and February . The Monongahela River froze over , prevented barge shipments of coal and forced the closing of virtually all of the river mines . Most of his friends were in the same boat . They 're still trying to make up for what they lost during the " freeze . " The Klondike field , so named because of the wealth of its coal resources , is thick with the so-called captive mines owned by the steel companies . Frick is by far the biggest producer he : e , but Crucible Steel and Youngstown Sheet Tube also have mines nearby . These mines lost thousands of tons of production during the winter and individual miners lost anywhere from $200 to $400 in pay . That 's one reason why the " pinch " has started , as Frank Boskovich said . But it is n't serious yet . After Cash , Credit Miners are used to getting pinched . It 's happened so often they know exactly what to do when a strike comes . They cut down on their food purchases . Where they 've paid cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savings bonds . And , if they 've got cash in the sock , they start digging . How long can they hold out ? " Figure we can last indefinitely , " said on .. " Another week and it will be bad for some of the fellows , " said another . " Listen , " said a man in a bar in Masontown , " I live in the ' patch ' and I know Some of the people down there are hungry already . " " Yes . it 's pretty hard . " said John Ozanich. president of the Robena local . " But the men have their savings bonds and they 'll have to cash them . At the company stores , there is no limit on the credit but the men have cut down . " Most of the men would like to be working . but we 're looking out for the older men . And we do n't go back until this pension is settled on John L. Lewis ' terms . Something has to be settled , or we 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " John Ozanich was n't sure that the 10 cents royalty on each ton of coal mined is sufficient to pay pensions to everyone included in Mr. Lewis ' proposal . But he saw no difficulty there . " If the 10 cents is not enough , make it 15 cents " The Ronco miners are among the staunchest supporters of John L. Lewis . The few who do n't like their big boss do n't say much about it . The ones who do like him are enthusiast , young and old . Lou Markitoff has been in the union since 1922 . He 's 64 years old , and he was in a happy mood in front of the Union Supply Co. store at nonce ) . " And Sing a Lot " " Only thing I do n't have , " said Lou . " is money . " But me never go back . All I say is -- -stay solid , drink a lot of beer , and sing a lot . " The husky blond miner in the bar at Masontown was about 25 . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reason , " he said " Everybody wants to work , but we 're not going to until we get the pensions . The young fellows want to win this fight as much as the old ones After all , my dad 's a miner and he 'd he pensioned . " Would you stay out even if Lewis ordered you back and if there was no settlement on the pensions " Yes , I believe I would , " he said . You find that opinion repeated time and igain . One of the miners on the ball field at Ronco said the same thing in different words : " Lewis did n't tell us to go out and he ca n't tell us to go back . We 're not going back , maybe not even if Lewis says so , unless we get the pensions . " " We 've been out four weeks already , " said - mother miner , " and do you think we 'd go rack after that long if we do n't get the pen-dons . " Merchants in this southwestern part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks of idleness in the coal industry , their main support . But , as is the Case with the miners themselves , it is n't particularly serious yet . There are several reasons to explain this . The Klondike field and the other fields in the county have been enjoying abundant prosperity . Miners in the steel company-owned pits , which have been working six days a week , have been averaging about $170 a payday ( semi-monthly ) , or close to $350 a month . Many miners make considerably more than that , sonic as much as $500 a month . Redemption It 's an unusual miner who does n't stick a part of his pay into government " E " bonds . The bonds are handy things to have around in a case of a strike . Money pledged for the bonds ca n't be touched by the company in making deductions for grocery debts incurred earlier . Furthermore , the bonds are redeemable after 60 days . " And do n't think they 're not redeeming them . " said a banker in a Monongahela River @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on strike March 15 , this bank redeemed S422 in " E " bonds On the first day of the strike , redemptions suddenly leaped to $1,216 . On the second day , they were up to $1,600 . On the fifth day , they amounted to $2,311 . On April 3. redemptions totaled $2,200 . On April 5 , they hit a peak of $3,200 A second factor to explain why there has been a gradual , rather than a sharp , slump in retail business in mining towns is the liberal credit extended by most grocers , department store operators and other shopkeepers . Many miners deal directly with the company-owned stores , and , in these cases , the story around here is that the stores have continued extending credit pretty much as usual . There is little else they can do . If they cut off credit , they would have no business . As it is. their sales continue , although at a reduced pace , and they have the guarantee that the miner will pay up . The money is simple deducted from his pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Independent merchants find it tt their ad .. antage to grant credit . A hard-up miner denied credit when he has rough going would be likely to remember it when he is flush . " The miners are great installment buyers , anyway , " said a business man . ' ' They 're mostly always in a hole , but they always pay back . The merchants know that  --  arid they know that the miners are the lifeblood of their business . " Everybody 's felt the slump but it could be worse , and it will be much worse if the strike continues another week . " Storekeepers in the small mining towns are careful what they say about John L. Lewis . But a few are outspoken . " He 's got too much power , " said a druggist " The country 's gone to hell when they let Lewis get away with something like this , " said a filling station operator . But with the miners , the only story you hear is the same old one : " When are we going back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says so , I guess . He 's the boss . "
