Perhaps the " military idiots " of London and Washington were merely inciting Adolf Hitler to further rage and bafflement ( see p. 23 ) . Perhaps the Germans were merely inciting the Vichyfrench to open war on Hitler 's side . Or perhaps the many signs of visible preparation last week meant what they seemed to mean : that the Allies , unwilling to risk a second front in Western Europe this year , were getting ready to move in Africa instead . <P> &gt;Axis broadcasters reported , with a great air of knowledge , that U.S. combat forces were massing in western Africa ( see map ) : in Sierra Leone , Liberia , Nigeria , Cameroon . If so , then the U.S. , for all military purposes , had taken over the great coastal belt embracing the Allied ports of Freetown , Takoradi , Lagos and Accra , feeding the new air and surface supply routes to Egypt , the rest of the Middle East and Russia . Furthermore , if the Axis was right , U.S. forces were moving into positions from which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &gt; Dakar 's Governor Pierre Boisson prepared to evacuate European ( mostly French ) women and children . ( Dakar 's military commander , General Paul Felix Barrau , was in Algiers burying his wife and son , who were killed in a French plane crash last fortnight . ) <P> &gt; Dispatches " from the French border " reported that Vichy submarines had sneaked past Gibraltar and reinforced strong French naval forces in Dakar 's harbor . <P> &gt; Moscow 's Tass said that Berlin had given Vichy permission to reinforce its North African garrisons with three new infantry divisions , a tank regiment , two artillery regiments and one air group . <P> &gt; Vichy 's War Secretary , Lieut . General Eugene Bridoux , referred bitterly to the British conquest of Madagascar ( see p.21 ) and said : " Tomorrow new assaults may be conducted against certain of our territories . These assaults , if they should occur , must find us strong and in a position to fight . " <P> Why Dakar ? Allied seizure of Dakar alone would be mainly a defensive measure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack the Allies ' trans-African routes and the Atlantic waterway feeding those routes . But Allied action , once begun , need not stop at Dakar . A really effective African offensive might include simultaneous or successive moves against Casablanca and other key points on the long French African coast between Dakar and the Mediterranean . Every move up that coast would be a move to : 1 ) cut off Rommel 's forces in their rear ; 2 ) bar the Germans ' way to complete conquest of North Africa ; 3 ) restore Allied control of the western Mediterranean ; 4 ) assist a thrust into Germany 's southern Europe . <P> Africa is divided by two great military barriers : the jungles of the Congo , which isolate British South Africa from most of the continent , and the Sahara desert , which divides the Mediterranean littoral ( now mostly Vichy-and Axis-held ) from the more habitable portion of the tropics lying north of the Congo ( see map ) . By cleaning out Dakar , Timbuktu and other small holdings , the United Nations would have this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
