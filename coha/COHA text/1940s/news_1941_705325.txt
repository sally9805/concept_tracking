txt FARE RISE IS URGED FOR CITY 'S TRANSIT TO LIGHTEN BUDGET Citizens ' Group to Press Its Drive to Put System on Self-Sustaining Basis DEMANDS COUNTY REFORM Declares Municipal Expenses Must Be Reduced to Offset Growing Defense Costs The Citizens Budget Commission announced yesterday in its annual report that it would continue to work for a higher rapid transit fare to place the city 's unified system on a self-sustaining basis and thereby relieve the budget of a subway deficit approximating $30,000,000 a year . Last year it proposed a seven cent fare . Declaring that city government costs continue too high and that they must be reduced to compensate for growing national defense costs , the commission said it would continue to seek reform of county government in the city to save $500 , - 000 annually , urge the repeal of mandatory laws freezing payroll costs in the annual budget and fight for pension reform that would set up special reserves for the police and fire pension systems . " Excessive spending " was held to be the cause of the city 's financial stringency . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , chairman , said that " few real economies have been attempted and that if an appropriation falls below that of the previous year , the saving , large or small , is often diverted for increased spending in another direction . " Added Income " Gobbled Up " " Increased spending , " the report continued , " has sucked up the $13 , - 000,000 a year in added income from the 50 per cent jump in water rates ( $83,000,000 in all from that one source ) ; it has gobbled up $3,500,000 in the police and fire pension contribution ( which future administrations must somehow repay ) ; it has absorbed windfalls in the form of increased State and Federal aid for child welfare and old-age security ; it is eating up over $400,000 a year of the occupancy tax surplus . Still other examples could be cited . " There is one way to check the rising tide of city expenditure and that is by an aroused public opinion compelling economy . Former administrations were criticized for boosting the payroll . " But there are 20,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclusive of subway workers . The added payroll cost is $40 , - 000,000 . This $40,000,000 goes for new employes and salary increases . Pressure groups have been listened to , catered to at public expense . Protests against spending and proposals for economies from citizen groups have often gone unheeded . " Discusses Subway Costs Concerning subway costs , General Nolan said : " The heavy subway deficits are a burden the people can no longer bear . Our rapid transit system is now city-owned and operated . It can and must be self-sustaining , if the city 's finances are to be placed on a sound basis . " Additional subway extensions are unwarranted . They draw our population away from centers which // FARE RISE IS URGED TO LIGHTEN BUDGET // can and should be attractive residential districts . They add to the subway deficits ; they destroy taxable values within the heart of the city , without commensurate taxable expansion in the outskirts . They increase fire , police , school , lighting , street and sewer charges and other lexpenses ; they duplicate services and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . playgrounds , new bridges , tunnels , highways and public : buildings , have their place in a growing community . We have come through ' a period of extraordinary activity in operating these and other improvements . " Common sense dictates a recess in the undertaking of new projects . The municipal debt is at a staggering total ; the ' city 's borrowing capacity is practically exhausted . Much of the debt for recent and still uncompleted improvements must be paid for before the city can undertake further.improvements , excepting those necessary to public safety or those which ? are clearly selfsupporting . " The commission quoted Mayor . La Guardia 's - reference - to mandatory laws standing in the way of budget economy , and added ; " The Mayor touched only a . minor sore spot , a trifling fraction of the scores of millions under . mandate , . He was silent on proposals before the Legislature on educational salaries , the largest mandated , item in the city budget . " Three times in recent years the commission has drafted and sponsored laws to wipe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city administration withheld its support , the report said .
