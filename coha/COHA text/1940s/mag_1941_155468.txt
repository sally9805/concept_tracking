Among the tribulations of combat pilots are the flare of searchlights , the crump of bursting ack-ack shells . Another kind of flier , the duck , finds the same things just as annoying . Month ago the 198th Coast Artillery , at Camp Upton , L. I. , postponed its aerial target practice because hunters complained that the firing was scaring away wild ducks . Last week the 198th fell foul of the birds again . <P> This time it was the 100,000 domestic ducks of the Long Island Duck Farmers ' Association , fattening on nearby farms . Awakened by the searchlights feeling the sky for decoy planes , the ducks charged around in their wire pens like Brooklynites in the subway . They developed insomnia , turned up their bills at corn . Colonel Clair W. Baird , commanding Camp Upton , sighed , ordered his artillerymen to turn their lights the other way .
