Hispanidad is a curious , almost indefinable doctrine . Its present-day adherents preach that only by a spiritual union of the New World 's Spanish-speaking countries with Roman Catholic Mother Spain can mankind be saved from godless Communists and heretical Anglo-Saxons . In Argentina , where the Peron regime until recently made much of its close kinship with Spain , the doctrine has won many a convert . But last week , hard on the heels of the failure of Argentina 's trade agreement with Spain ( TIME , April 25 ) , a distinguished Argentine cleric was calling Hispanidad a lot of nonsense . <P> The priest was energetic Father Hernan Benitez , graduate dean of the National University of Buenos Aires , professor of philosophy , and Evita Peron 's longtime adviser on social problems . In Father Benitez ' opinion , France , not Spain , is Argentina 's true spiritual home . <P> " Not only the style of our houses , the art of our furnishings , the clothes of our women , but our very spiritual life , " wrote Father Benitez @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France from every pore . . . Every year some 20,000 Argentines go through Paris , while only a hundred or so pass through Madrid . In spite of differences in language , we Argentines feel at home in Paris . . . The man born on the pampas thirsts for wide , liberal and generous horizons , and hates fanaticism as well as mental and spiritual intolerance . Is not France , which has allowed free play for the individual will , more Christian than a country with inquisitorial corsetings and internal slaughterings ? " <P> The Spanish were furious , all the more so because , when Evita Peron visited Madrid two years ago , Father Benitez was a much sought-out member of her party . Madrid 's press fairly sizzled . Ya wrote : " It makes one wonder whether the priest 's mother had a weakness for a Frenchman . " Editorialized Bilbao 's El Correo Espanol : " A bilious and ill-adapted clergyman . " <P> Father Benitez was not taking back a word . " Can you imagine in these days such fanatical , Torquemada-like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he would open forums at which university students would be free to debate philosophy and politics . That , he said , would represent one step farther away from the hidebound teaching methods of the universities of Mother Spain .
