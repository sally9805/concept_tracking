Mr. Emmanuel ( Two Cities-United Artists ) tells the story of a sort of Jewish Mr. Chips , so creakily gallant and suicidally innocent an old gentleman that he goes from England to Germany in 1938 to look for the mother of a distraught Jewish refugee boy . He finds security , of an uneasy sort , in a seedy-bourgeois Jewish pension . But he soon learns that in Hitler 's Berlin it is as much as your life is worth to ask for somebody 's address , and that if you are a Jew , your British citizenship is worth only a laugh . When he takes his little problem to the police , he is arrested under suspicion of involvement in the assassination of a Nazi official . <P> The incredible guilelessness of Isaac Emmanuel 's errand , and his courage and dignity before his brutal judge and torturers , serve all the more to convince the Gestapo that he has a great deal to cover up . After prison scenes which recall those of Arthur Koestler 's Darkness at Noon , the old man is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nazi bigshot ( Walter Rilla ) who is infatuated with her . When at length old Isaac does find the boy 's mother , she has married a Nazi and has so wholly betrayed all that was ever good about her that , on his return to England , he thinks it best to tell the child she is dead . <P> Filmed in London , this screen version of Louis Golding 's novel ( TIME , July 24 , 1939 ) is in some respects as hammily insistent on wringing the last drop of emotion out of the audience as East Lynne or The Old Curiosity Shop . But since history has made its horrors real , and the story is intelligently produced and extremely well played , it is one of the most affecting of anti-Fascist screen melodramas . Stage Veteran Felix Aylmer turns in such a mellow performance as the fragile , intrepid old man that it is easy to forgive him for visibly licking his chops over the role . Norway-born Greta Gynt , as the cabaret singer , is so crashingly carnal in her first U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end . <P> Guest in the House ( Hunt Stromberg-United Artists ) is the psychological complement of another good Broadway-derived melodrama , Tomorrow the World ( TIME , Jan. 15 ) , in which a little boy from Hitler 's Germany tries to tear an American household apart . The heroine of Guest in the House is quite unpolitical , but she is a spiritual Nazi - a power-mad , not unfamiliar feminine type for whom psychiatrists could supply accurate names . <P> The minute whey-faced , invalid Evelyn Heath ( Anne Baxter ) enters the Proctor home and makes a tender request that nobody move and disturb this perfect picture for just a moment , any perceptive member of the family would have clapped on his hat and sprinted for help . But the Proctors , being merely nice , well-meaning people , are singularly unperceptive.
