In 1912 Congress made the transportation of prizefight films in interstate commerce a criminal offense ( $1,000 fine , a year in prison , or both ) . Widespread bootlegging weakened this ban and unhampered radio broadcasts made it almost meaningless , but it stayed on the books until last week . Then Franklin Roosevelt scratched his name to a repealing act passed by Congress , after 28 years making the movement of fight films over State lines legal . <P> Many grateful theatre managers and fight fans had forgotten why the ban had been imposed . Not so the man who lifted it , New Jersey 's Senator William Warren Barbour , now 51 and a fine figure of a Republican . <P> Reason for the 1912 law was Congress ' fear that action pictures of the conquests of big , black Champion Jack Johnson ( who not only mauled white fisticuffers but married a white woman ) would cause race riots . Of all the bumper crop of white hopes raised to beat Johnson , the choice of Roosevelt I and of Gentleman Jim Corbett was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barbour . Boxer Barbour , son of a wealthy thread manufacturer and known to his many admirers as " The Millionaire Kid , " was not averse , but his parents dissuaded him from turning professional . Last year , with another and more popular Negro champion on the throne , Senator Barbour thought it time to introduce his bill , got his friend Jack Dempsey to tell a Congressional committee that the movie ban was an archaic handicap to the manly sport . Republican Barbour is now training for a fast go with Democrat James Cromwell ( an amateur boxer who once went a few exhibition rounds with Tommy Loughran ) for his Senate seat .
