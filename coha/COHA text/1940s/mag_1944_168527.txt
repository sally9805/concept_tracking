Out of Aklavik in the icy Arctic came Fur Trader Stan Peffer ( also a hotel owner , grocer , theater operator , sawmill proprietor ) . In Edmonton on his annual business trip south last week he told a tale that sounded prehistoric . <P> In Aklavik , dinner tables groan under inch-thick steaks ( reindeer and caribou ) , heaping mounds of butter , jam , other war-scarce delicacies . Aklavik women , most of them Eskimos and Leacheau Indians , have all the silk stockings they need , can frequently be heard mildly bewailing " the third pair I 've ruined this week . " All sorts of consumer goods are available . <P> Explanation : nothing is rationed in Aklavik ( the population of 757 would not justify the trouble ) and Aklavikans get priorities because of their isolation and the importance of the Arctic fur trade .
