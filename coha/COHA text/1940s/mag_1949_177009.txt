Atomic-age man had better learn , and quickly , how to live with radiation . Last week the Atomic Energy Commission called a conference in Washington of sanitary engineers and sewage and water supply experts from all over the U.S. There is no reason to get panicky , the AEC said in its best scientific manner , but the U.S. must realize that the use of radioactive substances is increasing rapidly . Public health authorities must familiarize themselves with radioactivity as a regular problem . In the curriculum of the atomic age , said AEC Chairman David E. Lilienthal , radiation " has become a kind of fourth R. " <P> Locks &; Winds . At present , AEC experts explained , this fiercely dangerous stuff is well locked up . The Clinch River flowing near Oak Ridge is less radioactive than many mineral springs whose water is highly prized for drinking . The air outside the Oak Ridge plant is safe too . A man moving to Oak Ridge would get increased radiation equivalent only to the increase he would get ( from cosmic rays ) if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet , e.g. , Denver . <P> The new atomic plants now abuilding will be safeguarded carefully . The pile at Brookhaven National Laboratory , Long Island , 65 miles east of Manhattan , will operate only when there is enough wind to dilute its radioactive cooling gases below the danger point . Elaborate studies are being made by the U.S. Geological Survey to make sure that no radioactive wastes get into Long Island 's water supply . The " hot " uranium slugs from Brookhaven 's pile will be put underground to keep them from making trouble . <P> Plumbing &; Clams . But the time is coming , the AEC warned , when radioactive substances will be common outside such guarded centers . More &; more laboratories are using radioisotopes ( see above ) , and the atomic power plants of the future will necessarily contain vast quantities of radioactive material . It will be the duty of health authorities to see that none of the stuff damages the public . <P> To deal with the wave of future radiation , sanitary engineers should have Geiger counters and know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carefully all producers and users of radioactive material . They will have to make plumbers wear rubber gloves when cleaning " active " drain traps . They must test rivers , water supplies and sewers to make sure that no radioactivity has slipped in . <P> The problem is not a simple one . For instance , many water creatures , from bacteria to mollusks and fish , have the bad habit of concentrating certain elements , including their radioactive isotopes , in their bodies . They are not damaged by them , but the man who eats them may not fare as well . Fish market inspectors of the future may have to deal with shipments of " hot " clams . So far , the AEC has not recommended Geiger counters for the family refrigerator .
