The greatest liturgical composer who ever lived and one of the musical wonders of the ages was Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina , whose lacy counterpoint was the pride of the Vatican under Pope Sixtus V ( 1585-90 ) . The best U.S. interpreter of Palestrina is an Irish-American named Father William J. Finn , former choirmaster of Manhattan 's Church of St. Paul the Apostle , who has behind him nearly 50 years of high musical achievement . <P> Last week Father Finn published a book ( The Conductor Raises His Baton ; Harper 's , $3.75 ) . Extremely technical and written in a style of truly Celtic luxuriance , it is almost completely incomprehensible to laymen . But it is a required volume for students of sacred music and a fitting capstone to a distinguished musical career . <P> Father Finn 's musical specialty ( the a cappella* choral music of the 16th Century ) occupies the middle ground in the three great divisions of liturgical music . The others are : 1 ) the Gregorian Chant , pure , unharmonized 6th-Century melody , best heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France ; 2 ) the " modern , " which in liturgical circles includes all church music written since the beginning of the 18th Century - including Bach , Mozart , Beethoven and Verdi . Since 1904 , when Pope Pius X pronounced on the subject of sacred music in his famed encyclical Motu Proprio , the use of " modern " music by the Catholic church has been sharply restricted. ** But Palestrina 's 16th-Century creations ( best performed recently by the Sistine Chapel Choir of Rome , the Westminster Cathedral Choir of London and Father Finn 's choristers ) are regarded by Catholic authorities as liturgically flawless . <P> The Father . An Irishman , handsome as he is unmistakable , Father Finn rehearses his chorus in a polo shirt instead of a cassock , and can spur a choir boy to a Palestrinian high E with a flick of the eyebrow . Born 62 years ago in Boston , he became organist there at the Carmelite Monastery as a child . He began conducting Palestrina in Chicago 's old St. Mary 's Church in 1904 , a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to find out how to conduct it , " he says . In the meantime his Paulist Choristers became world famous . In 1918 Father Finn left Chicago for Manhattan . <P> During the past 35 years , he has trouped with his choir from California to Rome , where he was a great favorite with Pius X. In Milwaukee his playful choir boys stuffed the trombones and tubas , for an accompanied number , full of newspapers . The resulting tone , says Father Finn , " sounded like everybody was playing a fine-toothed comb . I had to ring the curtain down so we could fix things . " In Regina , Saskatchewan , Finn found himself without a baton . A gentleman , " a true gentleman , " says Finn , " took the rung of his chair and whittled it down so that it would fit between my third and fourth fingers , which is where I hold a baton . Halfway through the concert that baton flew out of my hands and struck a boy chorister across the face , but we continued . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
