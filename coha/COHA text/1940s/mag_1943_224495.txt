For more than 20 years tough old Nettie Thompson , a revolver strung from her neck-to use on interlopers-stuck to her barren cattle land on Wyoming 's Polecat Bench . She had homesteaded there in 1913 after hearing tales of a ranch hand who traced a suspicious smell to a prairiedog hole , lit his pipe as he peered into it-and woke up in the hospital . He had smelled natural gas . <P> There was oil around Polecat Bench all right : the Wyoming-Montana Elk Basin Field , that was first opened up by Ohio Oil in 1915 , has produced some oil and gas every year since . Oldtimers say the gassers used to " roar so damn much you could n't talk to your wife in bed without yelling . " But Nettie never struck enough to keep body &; soul together : in 1935 , hounded by creditors , she gave up and disappeared from Elk Basin. * No one knows what became of her , but if she could see her homestead today she would feel like shooting herself with her own revolver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood , a big rotary rig is drilling toward a great new oil-producing level some 4.000 ft. below the original " Frontier " sands . <P> Across 6,000 acres 19 deep wells are already flowing with black oil from the newly discovered Tensleep sands ; eight more are drilling and another two dozen are waiting their turn with the rotary rigs . At night great gas flares light the skies from Polecat Bench to West Squaw Tit at the Montana end of the field . The Tensleep sands , first proved to be oil-bearing last December , still represent the only major producing field opened up in the U.S. <P> since 1940 , with possible reserves of 300,000,000 bbl . <P> Led by Ohio Oil , the big U.S. oil companies swarmed over Polecat Bench . Last August Phillips Petroleum and Standard of Indiana 's Stanolind paid the U.S. Government $1.407,500 for drilling rights on 262acres of Federal land in Elk Basin-the highest price ever bid for the privilege of putting a drill bit into the ground . Last month Carter Oil , subsidiary of Standard Oil of New Jersey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discoverer of the Tensleep sands . <P> The big news at Elk Basin last week was Harold Ickes . The Basin 's swelling stream of oil has been pinched down to 14,000 bbl. a day for lack of adequate pipelines . The lines were approved by WPB , but frantically opposed by local truckers . Last week Oil Czar Ickes stepped into the fracas , recommended immediate construction of two new pipelines ( one to Billings and Laurel refineries in Montana , the other to connect with Stanolind 's big line to Salt Lake ) . When the new lines are pushed through next year , Nettie 's homestead will really begin to pay off . <P> <P> * Not to be confused with California 's Elk Hills Field .
