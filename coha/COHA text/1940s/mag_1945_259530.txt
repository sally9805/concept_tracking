Deep in Pennsylvania 's blue Pocono hills is a 350-acre tract of farm and wood land called Kirkridge . In Kirkridge 's ram shackle old farmhouse last week were gathered twelve Protestant ministers and laymen who described themselves as spiritually " hungry . " Kirkridge is a " retreat " of an unusual kind in the Protestant church . Three years ago a small group of ministers ( inspired by Scotland 's famed Iona Community ) met to plan a " dedicated order " in the Protestant ministry . <P> During the three days of their fourth retreat last week , they followed " a careful pattern of devotion , " manual work , discussion and meditation . In the mornings they went to the mountaintop to chop trees and work on their new Kirkridge Lodge , of modern design . Afternoons were spent discussing social problems and sharing " faith-building " experiences . In the evenings , after supper on long wooden tables , they met by the hearth for devotions and evening prayer , after which no body spoke until work time next day . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a bare table , a loaf of bread was passed around for each to break , an earthen Communion cup for all to drink from . The final prayer of the " hungry men " of Kirkridge : that they might achieve " a new , hardbitten , humble dedication to neglected but crucial tasks . . . . "
