Moscow had big literary news : Soviet citizens are going to get more to read this year than ever before . If the state-owned presses stay on schedule , 1947 will be the biggest year in Russian publishing history : 23,000 titles , totaling 430,000,000 copies , in the Soviet Union 's 100-odd languages and dialects . Every book is fit for Russian eyes and minds : Glavlit , the Government bureau in charge of such things , had seen to that by hand-picking each title . <P> No publishing risks are involved in Glavlit 's grandiose program .

Reader demand by itself can no more create a best-seller in Russia than public tastes can alter the content of the food ration . But popular writers sometimes get spectacular receptions , which indicate that Glavlit can guess wrong . For example , a 15,000-copy printing of Valentin Kateyev 's Son of the Regiment lasted just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach Soviet readers in small , carefully measured doses this year . Considered safe for reprinting are the works of Washington Irving , O.

Said the director of one Moscow publishing house last week : " We did n't see anything else that would interest Soviet readers . "
