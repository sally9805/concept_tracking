But this is the first self-pitying novel about the experience . <P> Under the stress of pre-induction anguish , the protagonist , a former employe of the Inter-American Travel Bureau , b haves very badly . He quarrels with his well-meaning relatives , insults his friends , lives off his wife because he sees no point in getting a job that can only be tem porary . He also plays around with a trol lop , and whenever he grows too utterly unhappy , goes out walking in the rain , getting his feet wet to spite everybody . <P> But this silliness conceals a noble heart . In nearly 200 pages of introspection , the dangling young man magnanimously forgives his rather unattractive intellectual friends their faults , even forgives the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shall shoot , I shall take lives ; I shall be shot at , and my life may be taken . Certain blood will be given for half-certain reasons , as in all wars . Somehow I can not regard it as a wrong against myself . " ) <P> The agony of waiting finally becomes too great for him . He writes to his draft board that he would rather be taken than kept waiting . And the draft board obliges . <P> Dangling Man is a very carefully written book .

It might be even more sympathetic if Author Bellow ( who is not in the Army ) ever seemed to suspect that , as an object of pity , his hero is a pharisaical stinker.
