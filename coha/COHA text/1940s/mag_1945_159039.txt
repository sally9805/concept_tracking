All last week , Red Army athletes prepped diligently for a Big Four track meet in Berlin 's Olympic Stadium . Then , just before they were to step on the field against British , French and U.S. Army men , loudspeakers blared : " The Russian team ... is not participating . " There was no official explanation . Unofficial explainers held that the Russians had merely made a belated discovery : that they would not have a chance , except possibly in the weight events . <P> Shorn of the Russians , the meet went on , with newsreel cameras grinding from what once was Hitler 's private box . The best performance was a 6 ft. 4 3/10 in. high jump by Sergeant Pete Watkins , ex-Texas A &; M , who also won the no-meter high hurdles in 15.3 sec . The score : U.S. 94 , Britain 43 , France 25.
