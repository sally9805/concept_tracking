Murder Makes Us Gayhotel somewhere on the mainland and communicated with us we -- well , something could have been arranged . You could have waited " I could n't wait . I waited seven years . You could n't appreciatewhat it feels like , after having been as free as a bird , to be cramped in a prison . But that was n't the worst of it . I spent every day waiting and trying to picture what the little fellow would look like when I got out . " Naylor laughed harshly . " Wait ? Why , I could n't get here fast enough . " " But what good does it do ? " Banks asked reasonably . " Why do n't you look facts in the face ? You 've got no future ; besides , with your reputation  --  you ca n't do Billie much good .

I can see by your expressions that that is just what you are planning to do , but you wo n't get away with it . Understand ? " He spoke without dramatics , but the very fact that he was so self-contained had a terrifying effect . Mrs Leighton had become very red and fairly screamed at Naylor . " Why , you  --  you despicable person ! You , a drunkard and a murderer , want to take a child into your custody , want to take it away from decent people and a decent home . You  --  you " Polly , please stop that noise , " Banks commanded irritably . Laura stood with a hand pressed to her breast . She seemed unable to do anything but stare at Naylor .

The season is almost over . Then we 'll be free to do all the talking you want . " " Why ca n't I be just another guest ? " Naylor asked , pleading in spite of his rigid self-control . " No , it wo n't do . People will remember , and in no time at all there ' II be a scandal . Why , just seeing you two together would start the talk . It  --  it gave me a shock to see how much the boy resembles you . Now ca n't you be reasonable ? " Denny looked at Naylor , whose eyes were fixed on Laura .

You made enough of a mess out of her life and you sha n't start again now . Everything has been so peaceful ; it 's a pity you could n't stay where you were . " " Mother ! " Laura exclaimed faintly . However , Polly had no intention of holding her tongue . Her tirade continued until Naylor turned to Denny . He shrugged significantly and led the way from the room . Outside he paused to light a cigarette . Denny said uneasily : " You must n't take the old lady serious . She 's daffy about this kind of life . " " I know all about her . Do n't forget she was my mother-inlawfor seven years . " They walked down the long , beautifully vaulted hall . Flowersand ferns were lavishly banked in all the niches , and where the sunlight penetrated the filigreed arches the colors of the wall mosaics shone brilliantly . A trim , white-liveried bellhop passed them with a brisk step ; his alert eyes had rested curiouslyon Naylor . In the rotunda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Us Gayverged , they came upon a little group of people who were chattering noisily . At the sight of Denny one of the women gave a cry of delight and came toward them . " Oh , there you are ! Polly said you were going to help She stopped , obviously fascinated by Naylor . Denny felt uncomfortable . The last person they should have met was the volatile Princess Clementina , but there she was , slender and regal , her shimmering blond hair piled up coronet-fashion , emphasizing her lovely throat , and her startling , velvet-brown eyes wide with surmise . There was nothing he could do but introduce them . A whimsical smile touched her lips . " You remind me of someone , Mr Naylor . Who can it be ? " She spoke in a beautiful , low voice . Sometimes at night , when she was in high spirits , she would sing for the guests in the patio . Then Denny was ordered to accompany her since she never would sing with anything but violin accompaniment . Whether she spoke or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Naylor could answer her teasing query the rest of the party joined them : Monte Korne , a sleek , dark individual , handsomely bronzed but unpleasantly arch ; Gerald Morrison , slouchy and dissipated ; Tony Seton , the extremely **25;7456;TOOLONG actor and Mary , his young sister . They were all jolly and since they all liked Denny they were willing to like his friend . Still , under their gay talk , one could see the speculations forming . Here was a man who did n't fit . Who was he ? Where did he come from ? Why was he there ? Tina put out deft feelers , but Naylor as deftly dodged them . Finally Denny said , as he noticed the persistent questioning of the princess : " Well , we 've got to be off . See you later . " With a comic gesturehe motioned them to be gone and pulled Naylor intoMurder Makes Us Gay 23one of the side halls . " Let 's get out of this for a while . How about a swim ?

I 'll not be in until twelve , when I have to get spruced up for the noon session . " Naylor went off without another word , and Denny sauntered out . He was thinking of Naylor , cursing the heat and the necessity to play dance music in the middle of the day . He had no real destination in mind but eventually ended up in the village . There he ran into Ray , clad in bathing trunks with a towel around his shoulders . " Coming ? " Ray asked laconically . Denny joined him , and together they went to the village bathing beach . There were few people out , and the waves washed lazily on the shore as though they , too , were too hot to show much spirit . " Damn this heat , " Denny groaned . " In an hour I 've got to put on a tie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . " Ray threw him an understanding look , but he wasted no effort in talk . Denny continued to grumble until they reached the little beach house . He went in to be supplied with a pair of trunks . When he came out he felt in better humor . Ray was already in the water , swimming straight out toward he horizon with long , easy strokes . Denny secretly envied Ray his physical prowess , but he did nothing to emulate it . He paddled amiably about a few yards from the shore until Ray i ame back , blowing like a whale . Then they retreated to the shadow cast by the beach house and settled for a smoke . For a while they did n't talk . Then Denny said : " Naylor worries me. " 24 Murder Makes Us GayRay , flat on his back , asked , " Why ? " " Oh , I do n't know . He 's so damned bottled up . I wish he 'd clear out . " " He wo n't . " " Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a swim I wish a shark would swallow her . " " Pity the poor shark . " After a minute Ray raised his head . " Why ? What 's she done now ? " " Nothing worse than usual . But I get so damned sick of seeingher dance the rhumba with that buck-toothed Korne fel-low . " Ray laughed . " Cheer up . It 's near the end of the season , and he 'll go the way of all the others . " " I do n't think so . From what I 've seen and heard Monte Korne 's out to marry the old gal . I have a hunch he 's stony . The other night at the casino I saw him snitch a few chips from Grandpa Stuyvesant 's pile . The old fellow 's deaf as a post and gets so excited when he plays you could steal his toupee , and he 'd never notice . " " Stealing , eh ? " Ray asked with distaste . " Are you sure ? " " Uh-huh , but do n't quote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't forget that . " " Was he slick ? " " Plenty slick enough to show long practice . " " Oh hell ! These guys are always around where there 's wealth and old ladies . " Ray flung away his cigarette and rolled over on his stomach . Denny sat with his back to the wall and his knees pulledup . He was wishing that he possessed some of Ray 's complacency ; then he could be as happy as the devil in this place . He was about to comment on this failing in his character whenLouise Brookes appeared around the corner of the building . " Well , look who 's here ! " she exclaimed . " I might haveknown . " Both Ray and Denny brightened at the sight of her . Murder Makes Us Gay 25Aside from her sprightly spirit she was wonderful to look at since her white bra and shorts left most of her supple , brown body exposed . " Anybody got a cigarette ? I left mine in the room . Ca n't stay long . I go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her as she pressed the water from her dripping curls . When he had transferred it from his lips to hers he said : " You and me both . This big bum can lie around all day . Being a policeman here is just a sinecure . You 've got to have pull to get the job . " " Well , sinecure or no , it keeps him wonderfully fit . You ought to get more exercise , Denny darling . You 're getting heavy . Look at how lean Ray is ! You know somebody could do a nice charcoal sketch of him . He 's got a face and figure that lends itself to angles and planes . " " Shut up , Lou , you 're making him self-conscious , " Denny remarked sotto voce . Lou sat up cross legged . " Look , you two  --  I think something is brewing . Just before I came out here the great almightyBanks had me into his office to give me a confidential message . You know Eleanor is on duty now , and he does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ message ? " Ray asked , always sticking to pertinent facts . " He wired the bigwigs to ask how he should go about gettingan undesirable individual removed from the island . That is , of course , without notoriety . He swore me to secrecy . I crossed my fingers and excluded you two . " " But what  --  say , Naylor ! Do you suppose it 's Naylor he 's planning to kick out ? " Denny was already indignant . Ray was cautious . " Need n't be . Might be Korne . You know how lynx eyed Banks is . Nothing gets by him . If you saw Korne Banks probably did too . " 26 Murder Makes Us GayLou wanted to know what he meant , and Denny explained . She listened attentively but with a slight expression of antipathy . At the end she said : " Maybe it was about that , but Banks looked rather upset . He does n't ordinarily , even when big things happen , like the time Brenda Shaw killed herself . I always thought he was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't see much of him . I usually get my orders from Chesty . " " Do n't we all ? " Denny muttered with a sigh . Robert Chester was Banks 's assistant and a typical little man made pompous by responsibility . " Did you notice , " Lou queried irrelevantly , " that Billie 's got a cleft chin just like Naylor ? He 'll be the spittin ' image of his dad as soon as he loses his baby roundness . I feel sorry for Naylor . I saw Pete this morning , and he told me he 'd got the impression Naylor was looking for a job . Flying one of the taxis , you know . At least flying is what they talked about on the way over . " Denny snorted . " Swell chance he 'd have for anything like that with the whole family set against him . " He was thinking of the scene that morning . Queer , Naylor should n't have had sense enough to know what his reception would be like . From various scraps of information Denny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those seven years he was in the penitentiary . He had no family outside of wife and in-laws , and his friends had faded away . If people had wanted him around would n't they have contacted him as his time came to an end ? And if he had wanted to could n't he have been paroled ? Maybe he did n't have the necessary cash if a bond was required . There were a lot of things Denny would have liked to know about Naylor , but instead he had to go and make music for people who talked louder than he played . Murder Makes Us Gay 27 " Well , angel , how about you and me trotting back ? " he suggested . Lou nodded and rose to brush the sand from her anatomy . Then she buttoned herself into a linen jumper , tied an enormousbeach hat onto her damp , mussed hair and said : " O.K. Let 's go . " Denny grinned . " That 's speed . But I 've got to get my pants . Do n't let Ray gang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a face at him . When he had disappeared she asked Ray , " Are n't you coming back with us ? It 's near feeding time . " " No . I think I 'll snooze awhile . " Lou dug the toe of her sandal into the sand . For a moment she burrowed busily , then she shrugged . " Suit yourself . See you later , " she chirped airily and started for the hotel . When Denny caught up with her she asked , " What 's the matter with Ray ? " " How should I know ? Do you have to talk about him when you 're with me ? " " I was wondering whether he was mad about something , " she continued , ignoring his question . " Maybe about you , " Denny remarked with an impudent smile . " Oh , be an ass if you want to and see if I care . " Lou flung up her head and put some space between them . " Honey , I 'll be an ass until you marry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lou sniffed . " You 'd get the surprise of your life if I ever took one of your silly proposals seriously . " IIINo ANSWER HAD COME THROUGH ON BANKS 'S CONFIDENtialtelegram , Lou reported , but it was a known fact that Leon Paine , one of the members of the syndicate , had arrived on the morning of the next day . So perhaps he was the answer . At dinner the second day Jim Baxter , the band leader , came in and favored Denny with prolonged , apprehensive looks . After a while Denny said : " Well , out with it . What do I have to do now ? " Jim 's long face turned red . All the men in the band liked him and worked hard for him , which was why the extra demandsof the mighty always put him on the spot . " The princess is giving a little party and wants to sing . That means you . " " Yeah . And of course it will be after hours ? " Jim squirmed and nodded . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how it is . " Denny fiercely broke a roll in half , smacked butter onto it , stuffed it into his mouth and after he had almost choked over it declared loudly : 28Murder Makes Us Gay 29 " When all day long is a party in this place why the hell does she have to give a little special party ? " " Shut up , Denny , you do n't want " I would n't care if she was one of the paying guests , but she 's only on the cuff . Why does Banks put up with it ? Is he in love with her by any chance ? " " I do n't know , " Jim said unhappily and began to eat his soup . He looked so mournful that Denny burst into a laugh , his temper evaporating as quickly as it had come . " All right , so I 'll go up and play her lousy gypsy songs while everybody gets drunk . Who 's the party for ? " " The princess has got a birthday or something . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All I could think was that after playing four hours , you 'd have to go there and fiddle another hour . " " That 's right . Go radical . It suits this place fine , " Denny commented . " It would be different if I had a date , " he remarkedmore soberly because he was thinking that Ray and Lou would probably have a grand time in the moonlight . Or they might go to Charlie 's and dance to the music of the juke box . He finished his dinner and afterward decided to walk along the sea wall . The path led past the dining-room windowsthrough which Denny could see the first arrivals at dinner . He had witnessed the scene so often that it hardly registeredany more . But that night as he looked at the opulence , the dignity and beauty spread out there he had a sudden insightinto the tremendous responsibility of running an establishmentof this sort . On the heels of this odd reflection came a mild surprise that Harold Banks was able to do it . However , when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had had a good meal and he was sleepy and , for once , content . He strolled along30 Murder Makes Us Gaythe wide parapet , enjoying the glories of early evening . A full moon was a yard above the water , filling the sky with a milky radiance . The water , banded in gold , lay almost motionless . The only sound was the faint rustle of the palm fronds and the lapping of the waves against the rocky shore . There were four kiosks along the wall which were supplied with benches . At this time of the night no one was about . A little distance from the last kiosk Denny paused to lean on the parapet . He let his cigarette butt fall from his fingers and watched it disappear into the water below . He had been standing there several minutes before he heard voices whispering . At first he thought nothing of them and continued his walk , which took him past the last kiosk . As he neared it he heard words that were much louder than the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the instant he paused he heard Laura say again : " No , Will , please listen to me . " She sounded as if she were crying . Involuntarily he peered into the dusky recess and saw Naylor with his arms about Laura , paying no heed to her struggles and kissing her violently . For a split second Denny was on the point of joining the scene . Then common sense made his feet move hurriedly toward the gate . There in the fragrant darkness Denny said : " Well I 'll be damned ! " He felt hot under the collar and wished to hell he had n't witnessed the scene . He wandered about , lighting one cigarette after another , and finally turned back to the hotel . " Why the devil should I worry ? " he asked the night . " It 's none of my business . " Arriving in the lobby , he ran pronto into Princess Clementinaand Jerry Morrison . The former , dressed in a set of inMurderMakes Us Gay 31tricately draped veils  --  Denny wondered whether there were seven of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to play for me ? " she asked sweetly . " Your wish is my command . " Denny 's frivolous answer brought her beautifully penciled brows together . " Do n't you want to ? " Her bluntness amused Denny , who replied in like manner : " No , but I will . " " Look here , Denny , watch your tongue , " Jerry admonished him sharply . Denny 's smiling eyes wandered impertinently over Jerry 's slouching figure . Even the best-cut clothes could n't hang right on it . His thinning hair , bulging forehead and pouchy face did nothing to improve his appearance . Tina was annoyed . " Jerry , do n't be a nuisance . Denny is joking . " Jerry shoved his hands into his pockets and continued to glower at Denny while Tina gave him instructions about her little party . It was to be in the small parlor near Banks 's privateapartment . They could be as noisy as they liked there because the casino was the only other set of rooms in that wing . Denny listened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking of Naylor and Laura . He was so familiar with Tina 's parties ; they required practically no thought on his part . He knew exactly what would happen . There would be twenty people in the room , all possessed with a screaming hilarity . They would drink champagne , and the princess would be coaxed to do impersonations . Eventually she would make a great to-do about choosing her songs , but nothing would come of it because she always sang the same old gypsy songs which Denny had learned by heart . He wished just for the sake of excitement that something32 Murder Makes Us Gaydifferent would happen that night . But nothing did . Except that the princess did not sing so well and that Jerry Morrison was in a bad temper , the party was as tiresome for Denny as all previous ones had been . It was a relief when Banks put an end to it by leaving . Denny was determined to go straight to bed , but when he reached his room Ray was there , sprawled in all directions . Denny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idea ? Have n't you got any home of your own ? " Ray 's overcast expression did not change . He merely pulled his legs up so Denny could reach the other chair . " I want to talk to you . " Denny divested himself of his clothes in record time . When he was down to his shorts he said : " All right . I 'm set . " " That was a silly thing to do if you want to go out again . " " But I do n't . I 'm going to sleep , believe it or not . " " Maybe . " Ray took the last two cigarettes from the packet , tossed one to Denny and lit his own . " I have a notion somethingqueer is happening around here . Paine had me on the carpet and pestered the life out of me about Naylor . Naturally I could n't tell him a thing . " " So what happened ? " " A couple of hours ago I went to see Naylor to ask him what all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Mrs Leighton ? And they were having a row you could hear in Florida . I 'm sure everybody in that wing heard it . Naylor looked just about ready to kill her . When she had gone he swore like hell and would n't talk to me . Finally when I would n't leave he ran out on me . " Ray nursed a deep silence . Denny waited a while and then he asked : " Where do we go from here ? " Murder Makes Us Gay 33Ray shrugged . " Paine is n't so smart . He 's got the house dicks all steamed up about Naylor . And you know what they are , " he finished with chilly contempt . " What 's the idea ? Wonder what Banks told Paine ? " " My guess would be that Naylor is going to kidnap Billie , and I would n't put it past him tonight . " " He could n't get away with it . " " Maybe not . He could swipe one of the planes . " " It 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Denny conceded . " But I do n't think Naylor would do a thing like that . " " How well did you know him ? " Ray 's black eyes glinted , and Denny had a glimpse of a side in his friend he did n't know so well . " Oh  --  not too good . Never heard of him until he was indictedfor manslaughter . After that I saw plenty of him . I liked him then and I still like him . " There was a lengthy pause while Ray digested this statement . Then he said : " Well , Paine thinks I 'm responsible for Naylor . I 'm sure I do n't know why . Evidently his precious private dicks are too good to watch ex-jailbirds . Might coarsen up their manners so they lose the gentle touch necessary for their clients . " " What do you want me to do ? Round up Naylor and have a heart-to-heart talk with him ? " Ray smiled . " I would n't like anything better . " " Are you serious ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Squid . He seemed about fixed to go on a bat . " Denny heaved a prodigious sigh . " Farewell , sweet sleep , " he quoted and reached for his pants . Gloomily he added a shirt and sandals to his trousers . " Well , there 's nothing like inviting trouble if you have n't got enough of your own . " 34 Murder Makes Us GayRay waited docilely until he was ready and then led the way out of the quiet building . " Where ' 11 we go first ? The Squid ? " Denny asked , more good natured now that he had started on the quest . " Might as well . " It was darker late that night because the moon was overcast . The artificial lights showed more plainly and were ugly in contrast to the former splendor of the night . " If you ask me I think we ought to mind our own business , " Denny said after a long silence . " They 'll have to fight it out some way . " Ray gave him a sidelong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight now  --  the state he 's in . If you 're a friend of his you ought to make him see reason . He was clean daffy to-night . " " I do n't blame him if Polly was screeching at him . She 's daffy herself sometimes . " Ray did not argue the point , but it was clear he also did not approve of Naylor 's behavior . There was no more talk till they reached The Squid , which Smiley was in the act of locking up . " Nothin ' doing tonight . I beat you to it . " " Has Naylor been here ? " Ray asked . Smiley shook his head . " Nope . I have n't seen him all night . In fact , not since a couple of nights ago . " From The Squid they went to Charlie 's , which was closing too . Then to the landing field . But the night watchman had seen nobody since the last plane landed . They searched along the dock where in a carefully constructed basin several smart cabin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watchman answered their question in the negative . " Maybe he 's back in his room  --  sound asleep , " Denny suggestedat last . Murder Makes Us Gay 35Undaunted , Ray said , " Let 's have a look . I 'd be damned glad to see him there . " The nearer they came to the hotel , the surer Denny was that Naylor would be in bed . He 'd probably gone for a walk , cooled down and then gone back to bed . All this tramping around had just been a waste of time . Ray was the one to knock on Naylor 's door . He did so softly and when there was no answer tried the handle . The door gave under his touch as though it had not been thoroughly closed . The dim light from the hall fell across Naylor 's bed , and , sure enough , there he was . Still dressed but asleep . Ray went close to the bed and stood looking down at him . Denny followed him . For a minute they studied the face of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though he were suffering from unpleasant dreams , and his breath was shallow and uneven . He tossed suddenly and murmured an unintelligible word . " Do n't wake him , " Denny whispered . Ray let himself be drawn into the hall , where he shook his head in pity . " The poor devil sure is shot to hell . " " Maybe you would be , too , if you 'd been through what he has , " Denny said shortly . " Thank God , he can sleep . " " Well , maybe he 's getting some good out of it . Anyway , he 's certainly not trying to run away with Billie , so let 's go to bed . " " A swell idea . " They walked down to the next floor . Denny paused to say good night to Ray . They were standing by a window , and just as Ray turned to go a queer sound disturbed the deep stillness of the night . Ray paused , listened a moment and then turned to Denny . " Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrugged . " Sounded like a bird crying . What 's the matter ? Getting the jitters ? " " There 's no bird here that makes a sound like that . It sounded  --  well , like a woman screaming , only it was so faint " Oh nuts ! Who 'd be screaming this time of the night ? " Ray was only half convinced , but he said no more about it . However , he had n't reached the end of the corridor before Denny popped out of his room again and came pounding down the hall . " Come on . Something 's happened . The whole casino is lit up . Maybe it was a woman screaming at that . " " Did you see anything else ? " Ray asked as they ran . " Some fellow was running down toward the village . It looked like Sparks , but it could n't have been . He has n't run in ten years . " They entered the hotel by the side door and were hurrying down the hall toward the casino wing when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bulging , and he was a pasty green . " Oh , this is awful ! This is awful ! What ' 11 we do ? This is awful ! " he kept yammering . Ray took him in a viselike grip that lifted him off his feet . " What 's happened ? " The clerk swallowed convulsively , his eyes popping more than ever . " Something terrible . Oh , what ' 11 Ray gave him a shake , and Denny shouted , " What the devil happened ? Ca n't you talk ? " " Mr B-Banks . He 's d-dead . " " What ? " Ray dropped him as though he were red hot . " Is n't it terrible ? What ' 11 we do ? Oh , this is awful and " Stop squawking and tell us how come , " Denny pleaded . The clerk pointed a finger vaguely toward the casino . Murder Makes Us Gay 37 " There . He 's s-shot . Killed . " " My God ! " Ray groaned and started on a run toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clerk stared at each other . " Was he murdered ? " Denny asked at last . The man spread his hands . " I , do n't know but I guess so . The house doctor sent Snarks for Captain Coburn when he did n't answer the phone . " Denny thought , " So Snarks had been running . " Impossible things did happen , it seemed . Just like Banks being shot . With an effort he pulled himself together and followed Ray to the casino . IVWHEN DENNY REACHED THE FIRST SALON OF THEcasino he found only the house physician , Dr Coates , Leon Paine , two house detectives and Coburn . Since he had expected to see the room overflowing with people the small group was a distinct letdown . They looked lost in the large , ornate place which was ablaze with lights . Denny approached them slowly ; he was n't at all sure he wanted to take part in the scene . Ray was kneeling on the one side of Banks ; Coates , on the other , was sitting back on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been dead a couple of hours ; at least that 's how it looks to me . Of course , I 'm not expert in things like this  --  I  --  well , my practice does n't include  --  er " Paine made an impatient gesture . " I know . I know . The point is he 's dead and obviously he did n't shoot himself and " We do n't know that , " Bert Nolan , one of the house detectives , objected belligerently. 38Murder Makes Us Gay 39The other , Joe Hinds , just stood and contemplated the dead man with a melancholy expression . " Of course he did n't shoot himself , " Paine barked . " Anybodycould see that . He could n't spread himself out neatly under a roulette table after he shot himself , could he ? " Paine was a tall , stoop-shouldered man . The one striking feature in his otherwise coarse face was his sharp eyes . They were narrow and cold and had a way of disconcerting his vis-a-vis with stabbing , critical glances . He was always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and too stupid to endure . Coates , an extremely polished gentleman , who resented the vulgarity of the whole business , rose and dusted off his trousers . " In that case you had better get in touch with the police immediately . They 'll have a man who knows how to handle these things . " Paine watched Coates wipe his hands on a beautiful white handkerchief which he had taken from the pocket of his silk dressing gown . Paine twisted his thick lips , and Denny had a notion he would have liked to spit at the refined doctor . Nolan poked Ray . " Here 's the police . Better tell him all about it . He came in a little late . " Ray ignored Nolan 's sneer . " I wish you would give me the details . " He was very quiet and matter-of-fact , which brought anotherimpatient gesture from Paine . " Better not stand around here talking while the murderer gets away . It would be a good idea to get after that Naylor fellow immediately . " " It would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , Mr Paine . For all I know , you might have shot Mr Banks because you were tired of seeing Banks make money hand over fist while you only lost it . " 40 Murder Makes Us GayPaine 's jaw dropped . He was too overcome even to glare at Ray . Nolan snickered while Hinds backed away to a more discreetdistance . Ray continued before Paine had closed his mouth . " Now , who found Mr Banks ? " " I did , " Nolan replied . " That is , I was the first here after Mrs Banks . She really found him and screamed . " There was no love lost between Nolan and Ray , but the former was no fool , and he knew Ray well enough to keep a civil tongue in his head when Ray looked as he did then . " What did you find ? " " Well , Mrs Banks was right here on the floor beside him , passed out cold after that one scream . He was laid out under the table , just like he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hands by his sides . Somebody must have wanted to hide him under the table . " " He was n't shot here ? " " How should I know ? I 'm telling you what I found . I took enough of a look to see he was dead and then I called Joe and told Snarks to get you . Joe and me tried to find a gun or anything else that might help , but there was n't any around . According to the looks of the wound , he could have shot himself , and somebody else could have tidied him up . " " That 's ridiculous , " Paine shouted . " You 're supposed to be a detective and you " How did you happen to come here ? " Ray interrupted . " I called him , " Hinds admitted dolefully . " We thought he ought to know . Him and Doc here . " " Anybody got anything else to tell me about this ? " Ray asked . " I mean  --  important , " he added as Paine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want all of you to clear out . Pronto . Except Denny . " This request was outrageous , and everyone said so , but RayMurder Makes Us Gaywas indifferent to their protestations . He instructed Denny whom to call from the mainland and whom to summon from the hotel . Then he turned back to the group . " All right . Clear out . " " See here , Coburn , I wo n't have you " Shut up and get out , " Ray ordered . Paine looked fit for apoplexy , but at last he strode from the room , apparently intent on raising hell somewhere else . Denny carried out the first half of his orders but then went back to the salon . He found Ray busy searching the room . " All the ash trays have been cleaned but this one . " He pointed to one which stood on a small table between two easy chairs . " I have a notion Banks sat here talking with someone after the casino had been closed and the trays cleaned . " " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was at Tina 's party . I saw him there myself . " Ray glanced at his watch . " Ten after five . Coates was probably a little generous with the length of time Banks was dead . Let 's say an hour and a half . Three-thirty . " " Who do you suppose did it ? " Denny asked . Ray raised his eyes from the chair he was examining . For a minute their gaze met . Denny began tapping his pockets in search of cigarettes , but he had none . " I was with him at one or so , " Ray said , still looking at the chair . " And we found him asleep a little after four . Would n't it  --  be hard to go to sleep after something like this ? " " I do n't know . I 've never tried it . " " Well , it need n't have been him . " " No . " " Damn Paine ! He 's all set to pin it on him . What do you suppose Banks told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We 'll find out . " Ray had straightened . " By six they ought to have a crew over here . We ca n't do much until then . " " Shall I round up Mrs Banks ? " " Yes . Maybe she 's over her faint . I want to talk to her and I do n't want to leave this room , so she 's got to come here . " Denny went in search of Laura . He rather expected to run into Polly , but the old lady was nowhere visible . Laura was sitting in her room , shivering . Katy , her elderly maid , was trying to apply cold compresses , to administer smelling salts and general consolation , but Laura sat unresponsive . She stared straight ahead with blank eyes . When Denny came in she scarcely noticed him . Katy made angry motions for him to leave , but Denny delivered Ray 's message . " Must I go ? " Laura asked dully . " I think you should . " Laura stood up and came toward Denny like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left little to the imagination and she would have gone as she was if Katy had not stopped her with a sharp exclamation . " Mrs Banks ! You  --  you ca n't go that way . " She hurriedly bundled her mistress into a heavy satin robe while she threw Denny disapproving looks . Then she fastened Laura 's tumbled hair with a blue ribbon . " There . Now you can go . " Laura submitted apathetically to Katy 's services . It seemed doubtful whether she even noticed them . It was only a short distance from her room to the roulette salon . Ray was waiting at the door . He made her sit in a chair from which little of the room was visible . He motioned Denny to retire to the side , and himself sat down opposite her . " Will you tell me just what happened tonight ? Until about three you were at the party given by the princess , were n't you ? " She nodded . She was very still , her eyes averted . Murder Makes Us Gay 43 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to your apartment ? " " No , I went alone . " " Do you know where your husband went ? " She shook her head . " How did you come to find him ? " She did n't answer . Ray waited several minutes . Then he asked : " Did you think he was meeting someone here ? " " No . No , I did n't . " " Then why did you come ? Were you worried when your husband did n't come back to the room ? " " No . " " Oh , come , Mrs Banks , you must have had some reason for coming in here . Usually this room is dark and closed by three at the latest . Often before if there are no players . You 'd have no reason for coming here unless you knew your husband was going to be here . Wo n't you tell me about that ? " He spoke in a low , kind voice and was very persuasive . Laura glanced at him but instantly averted her eyes again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came here . I  --  I just did . Perhaps it was " Her voice trailed off . " A hunch ? Is that what you wanted to say ? " She nodded . " Have you any idea who would want to kill your husband ? " At the question she caught her breath sharply and started to get up . Ray put out a hand to prevent her . " I mean aside from your  --  aside from Mr Naylor . " " He did n't do it , " Laura said , but in a queer , despairing voice . " I know he did n't . " " Well , let 's suppose he did n't . Have you any idea who did ? " Again she shook her head . " Not any idea at all ? You must realize that if Naylor did not shoot your husband someone else did . Did he have any44 Murder Makes Us Gayquarrels with a guest ? With anyone of the personnel ? With Paine ? " Each time she shook her head . " You 're not helping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin , and his forehead wore a frown . " I ca n't . I do n't know anything . It 's  --  it 's all so horrible . " " Well , how did you happen to see your husband ? He  --  was n't very conspicuous from the door , was he ? And it was dark . Or were the lights on ? " " No . No , it was dark . But  --  the lights  --  from the drive shone in ; there 's one right  --  right behind that window . " She pointed to the center one which was directly at the foot of the roulette table where Banks lay . " His white coat  --  the light shone on it  --  and somehow I just saw him . " She shuddered at the recollection . " I did n't realize just at first  --  and when I saw  --  I guess I screamed . Anyway  --  later  --  someone had carriedme back to my room . " Her face was dead white and sunken . It did n't seem possible that she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how she had looked at Tina 's party . Aloof , a little perfunctory smile on her full red lips . She had sat beside Banks , but they had not spoken to each other while he had observed them . She was then very self-contained , a little bored ; now she was near collapse , using all her will power to appear calm and coherent . Denny 's thoughts went back to Naylor . He had been asleep at a little after four . But it had n't been a peaceful sleep . " Your room is not very far from here , and these nights are certainly quiet . Did you hear the shot ? " " No . " " Nothing that sounded like a shot ? " " I do n't think so , though I may have and not noticed . I  --  I was thinking about other things . " " Well , were you in bed by three ? " Murder Makes Us Gay 45 " I -- no  --  it must have been later . I did n't go right to bed after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was so hot , you know . And champagne always makes me hot after drinking it . " " When did you leave the room to look for your husband ? After you had been to sleep ? " " No . I  --  waited for him . I wanted to talk to him . " " At four ? " Ray 's eyebrows rose . " Oh , what difference does it make whether it 's four or any other time ? It 's about the only hour of the day or night that I can talk to him without interruptions . " She pressed a hand to her forehead , swaying a little . " So when he did n't come you went straight to the game room to see what was keeping him . So you knew he was here . You knew he was having a private conference with someone where no one would hear them . " " No , no , I do n't . I  --  I just happened to go there . " Ray shrugged , obviously not believing her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he concluded , getting up . Laura forced herself to rise and tottered off down the hall . She had just vanished into her room when Paine arrived with Robert Chester . Paine was much calmer than when he had left and now looked worried . He lowered his voice when he spoke , coming close to Ray . " Now look here , Coburn , we do n't want this all over the hotel . It ' 11 be an awful scandal . We 'll give out that Banks is unwell . Lucky it happened when it did . None of the force but Snarks and the night clerk and a couple of others know about it . We 'll . . . " He continued at great speed to describe his plan of action . Chesty , looking like a pouter pigeon in a brown Palm Beach suit , kept poking his head in vigorous assent . He had reddish eyes , a little hooked nose and a mean trap for a mouth but he46 Murder Makes Us Gaywas a wizard at details . He was decent enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his high-and-mighty streaks . Denny was willing to bet his last dollar that Chesty was already calculating what chances he had of stepping into Banks 's shoes . Ray waited until Paine had finished . Then he replied : " I 'm willing to do all I can to cut out the notoriety , but you do n't know Coral Island if you think you can keep the guests from seeing a big crew of policemen wandering about the place . Not to speak of reporters . I admit it is twelve miles offshore , but that 's not the breadth of the Atlantic Ocean . Besides , it 's only eight miles around , so nobody can get lost . Whoever murdered Banks is on the island and has n't much chance of leaving it without our knowing . On the other hand , we 've got plenty of people to choose the murderer from . Most of them are going to say they were in bed when it happened . The couples can talk up for each other , but what about the singles ? You 're going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't in bed . Unless somebody 's kind enough to break down and confess this is going to be a swell party . " " I know all that , " Paine said impatiently , " but there 's no use making the people panicky . " " They 'll leave in a body , " Chesty moaned . " Two weeks of excellent business ruined because of this . " " Too bad Banks did n't do you the favor of dying on April sixteenth , " Ray remarked . " It would have helped to narrow down the suspects . " " Suspects ! I tell you , this Naylor " I would n't go around accusing people before you have any proof , " Denny said with a smile . " Naylor might sue you for slander , and , considering the seriousness of your accusation , he might get quite a good-sized sum out of you . " " That 's ridiculous ! If the man is n't guilty who is ? He can plead insanity for all I care but Paine 's declaration was abruptly terminated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Snarks tried to keep them behind him , but they just spilled over the place . Chief McLaughlin , Ray 's superior , was well informed upon the situation in Coral Island . He had sent a hand-picked squad who knew just how to go about their business and the message that as soon as Ray had covered the ground he himself would come over . Ray smiled wryly . " He means , after the dirty work 's been done he 'll supply the brains . Well , maybe I 'll beat him to it . " " Wo n't be the first time , " Denny said , knowing Ray 's past record included more than one clever crime solution . However , that was when he was on the mainland and before he had been given the sinecure on Coral Island . In fact , this post had been a reward for his earlier good work . " Still , I 'll be damned if I see how you are going to do it . " Ray himself was n't optimistic , but he settled grimly to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the various crews really got to work there was no room for him . Ray had changed from a phlegmatic , mild-tempered friend into a sharp , hard-driving police captain . Rather chagrined , Denny retreated to his room . Naturally he could n't sleep , so he had a shower , put on slacks and went down to Charlie 's for breakfast . He was in no cheerful mood , but the sight of Lou Brookes perched on a stool did a lot to improve it . " Hello , darling . You look terrible . Anything wrong ? " Judging by the sparkle in her brown eyes , he suspected she knew all about it , even though the rest of her face looked sweetly guileless . He grunted , " I was starved and could n't wait until the dining room opened . " The girl behind the counter set out coffee , toast , orange juice , and remarked : " Eggs in a minute . The heater is not working right . " Flossie was well acquainted with Denny King 's likes and dislikes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own48 Murder Makes Us Gaycounsel and refused to gossip , which was why Charlie put her on at the slowest time of the day . He knew how stimulating select gossip could be for the business . " Well ? " Lou asked as Denny persisted in being morose . " Got anything on your mind ? " " Sure . You know what it is . " " Do I ? " On second thought Denny wondered whether Lou would be looking quite so fresh and desirable , quite so irrepressible if she knew the horrible truth . Then he had another idea which made his heart feel as though someone had squeezed it . " Hey , you , " he asked suddenly , " you seem to have something on your mind . What have you been up to ? Did you and Ray ? " He signified the rest in pantomime . Lou looked surprise and innocence personified . " Why , Denny , wherever do you get such ideas ? " The imps came back into her eyes . " But if we did  --  you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , go to blazes ! " Denny was so relieved , he was mad . " Nobody knows where he 's at with you . You get me all excited when I have much more important things to think about . " " Here 's your eggs , Mr Denny , " Flossie said , shoving the plate between the toast and the coffee . " Kind of underdone , but the plate just wo n't get hot . " Lou made a face . " I 'll have to look the other way until you get through sopping those up . Better give him a spoon , Flossie , and do n't get any on your chin . There 's always something so undignified about eggs on a chin . " " Oh , shut up . You take all the pleasure out of life . " The eggs were slippery , and Denny had to concentrate on them . Lou slid off the stool and went over to the juke box , and after considerable thought stuck in a quarter . When the first notes sounded Denny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Murder Makes Us Gay 49Lou was executing impromptu but graceful calisthenics . In her starched , bright blue playsuit she Iooked more like a tenyear-oldthan the heart 's desire of two virile men . " She 's cute , " Flossie commented . " I hate cute women , " Denny growled and then shouted , " For Pete 's sake , Lou , come over here and act your age . " " Have you finished your eggs ? " " Yes , I have . " Lou gave up her acrobatics and climbed back on her stool . " I want a doughnut , please , Flossie , and some more coffee . " " Do you know what happened this morning ? " he askedsternly . " No , what ? " " I thought  --  maybe you knew . " " Well , I know some things . What are you talking about ? The Polly-Naylor row ? " " Oh , so you did hear it ? " Lou snorted . " I should say we did . Polly screamed enough to wake the dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folded his arms on the counter and waited avidly while Lou gobbled the last of her doughnut . " Seems like he 's a murderer , a home breaker , a thief and a general nuisance . " " That 's an anticlimax . " " Not the way she says it . Apparently Naylor makes Polly see red . Also Polly was terribly mad before she reached Naylor 's room because nobody could work up that kind of a temper in five seconds . " " How long did it last ? " " Oh , about a half an hour . Somebody came up and told them to quit the shouting . " " That was Ray . " Lou cocked her head inquisitively . " How come ? " 50 Murder Makes Us GayDenny explained about Paine and Ray 's apprehension . " Did you happen to hear Naylor come in ? " Lou shook her head . " I wish I had but I went to sleep right after all the hullabaloo died down . " " Is Polly often in the servants ' wing ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , all the help knows her strident voice . She ca n't speak softly if she tried . And then she  --  well , she 's always around . Some people are off the scene once in a while , but she just never is . She 's so high spirited , she makes me feel anemic . " " You have n't heard any kind of rumors about Banks , have you ? Aside from that telegram , did you hear or see " Say , what 's up ? Has anything serious happened ? You 're acting awful funny . " Denny did not reply . Instead he paid for their breakfasts and pulled her with him . The records were still playing as they left Charlie 's . " All right , Flossie ca n't hear you now . Tell me what it is . " " Banks was shot by somebody around three-thirty . He 's dead , and right now there are fifty fellows up there looking for the murderer . " " I do n't believe you , " Lou said flatly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or rather the devil 's . Ray is up to his ears in it , and Paine is all for arresting Naylor pronto . " " Oh , oh no ! " Lou gasped . She stood still , staring at him with a horror-stricken gaze . " It ca n't be . " " I do n't think it is either , but have you got the foggiest notion who it could be if it is n't Naylor ? " " I ca n't even believe it 's true , let alone know who did it . What does Ray think ? " Denny shrugged . " Have you got a cigarette ? " She sounded a little winded . " I  --  I do n't think I should have eaten that doughnut or done the calisthenics  --  or something . I do n't feel right . " Murder Makes Us Gay 51The cigarette did n't seem to help much . She continued to look frightened and sick . Denny slid his arm about her . " Buck up , angel . You 're not guilty . Neither is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about , is there ? " " No . But it 's so awful . Last night he walked by me  --  so spruce  --  and now  --  oh , why should anybody kill him ? " " I do n't know . Probably somebody hated him . Or was afraid of him . I never liked him much myself , and that goes back to Naylor . I always felt sorry for him , and it seemed like a dirty trick to swipe his wife while he was in jail . " " But she did n't have to marry Banks . She could have stuck by Naylor . " " Yes , that 's right , but some women  --  well , they have n't got much patience . And from what I heard they had been quarreling about his flying . " " Probably Polly helped there , " Lou said wisely . " Smart girl ! She most likely did . " " But that 's all ages ago . Whoever killed Banks must hate him right now . " Denny was feeling more and more depressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bad spot Naylor was in . Ray himself said he was acting daffy and Ray did n't know about the scene in the kiosk . Naylor had behaved there like a man out of his wits . Of course it was easy to explain . Naylor obviously loved Laura , just as he did Billie . If she came to meet him and they were alone it was n't so surprising his selfcontrolslipped . " What are you thinking about ? " Lou asked . " You look grim as death . You do n't think Naylor did it , do you ? " " Of course I do n't , " he replied with more conviction than he felt . " Poor Ray ! He 's going to have an awful time with all those swells. " 52 Murder Makes Us Gay " Oh , some of them are pretty decent . It wo n't take long to weed out the ones that have nothing to do with it . " " Do you suppose they 'll all leave ? " " Probably . " " Well , us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Denny was itching to look up Naylor . He was n't sure whether Ray would want him to go spilling the beans but he would n't have to . He could just talk around and see how Naylor responded . The more he thought of it , the more he felt inclined to do it . " What 's Pete want , do you suppose ? " Lou asked , breaking in on his meditations . They were skirting the landing field , and Pete , one of the pilots , was waving as he ran toward them . Denny squinted against the sun , trying to make out Pete 's expression . It must be some calamity to make the woodenfaced , stolid Pete take to running . When he reached them he was out of breath and the color of a ripe tomato . " Look , get up to the hotel as fast as you can and tell Coburn Naylor 's taken out the little crate , " he panted . " He 's got the kid with him . Left about fifteen minutes ago . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Were n't you ? " " No , I was n't here , " Pete interrupted angrily . " I just came down . That dope , Scotty , was here , and he thought Naylor was just demonstrating . He did n't know about Banks . I hope he 's got gas enough . I have n't checked it in days , but Scotty said Naylor looked , and the sap just let him go . I have n't telephoned because I do n't know what kind of a row it would start . I do n't want to drop a stick of dynamite where maybe he 's just giving the kid a joy ride . " Pete was calmer now , and his customary stolidity was making him more hopeful . Denny , on the other hand , felt worse . " I 'll pass on theMurder Makes Us Gay 53news , " he said glumly . " Funny thing , I was just getting ready to have a talk with Naylor . " " He 's taking an awful chance , " Pete remarked soberly . " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it up to the hotel . " Denny and Lou did n't have to be told twice . They set off on a run . VRAY LISTENED TO DENNY 'S REPORT WITH HARDLY ANYchange of expression . Whatever he thought of this development , he kept to himself . He gave two brief orders to the men helping him and then looked down again at the pile of notes on his desk . Denny was provoked by this lack of confidence . " How did he do it ? Were n't you watching him ? After what Paine said I thought you 'd have him under lock and key , " he said excitedly . " We 'll hear what Scotty has to say , " Ray explained , " before we go jumping to conclusions . If he is trying to get away he wo n't have much luck . And if by chance he should vanish , then it 's Paine 's fault for wanting to hush up this business . Everybody knows it by this time ; they might as well have known right off . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incredulously . A faint smile softened the hardness of Ray 's mouth . " You do n't want me skittering around the place having hysterics , do you ? " 54Murder Makes Us Gay 55 " No , but  --  well , I do n't know " Lou reddened under his cynical gaze . " You do n't have to be so cold blooded about it , " she flared . " There 's enough people around here with high blood pressure without me . " A man came in , and after a cursory glance at Denny and Lou he dropped a batch of papers on Ray 's desk . " There 's the next lot , Captain . So far we have n't found a thing worth putting on the top of the pile . Just routine questions and answers . " He hitched up his trousers and then brought out a pipe which he began to fill . As he did so he shot several looks about the room and finally remarked , " Swell place , is n't it , sir ? " Ray nodded . He had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had n't expected anything different . Absent-mindedly he introduced the newcomers . " This is Denny King and Miss Brookes , Lieutenant Conrad . " " Oh , you 're the wonder boy who plays the solos when Baxter 's Band broadcasts , eh ? " One of Conrad 's bushy eyebrowswas raised in interest . " You do all right . " " Thanks , " Denny replied with a grin . " It 's a relief to know the stuff goes across better than it sounds here . " " He 's just modest , " Lou inserted sweetly . " Yeah ? " Conrad stuck the pipe in his mouth and looked at Ray . " Well , do I start on the next fifty ? " " Guess you have to . It 's a dull job but it 's got to be done . " " My one ambition is to land a confession sometime when I 'm taking these mass statements . The shock might make me a new man , " Conrad said dryly and blew out a great cloud of smoke to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an instant a gleam of hope showed in his eye . " Do n't suppose you 've come across anything ? " " Not yet . " 56 Murder Makes Us GayConrad wagged his head resignedly and went out . Denny remarked : " He seems to be a good scout . " " Yes , he is . I 've worked with him before . He 's got no imagination at all , which is sometimes a blessing . Oh , here 's Scotty . " A little , sandy-haired individual in khaki-colored overalls edged up to the desk . He kept pulling his cap from one hand into the other . " I swear , Captain , I do n't know nothing about this . " He gestured vaguely behind him . " Naylor 's been down to the field before and into the hangar with Billie . He 's always been most particular not to get in the way . I  --  I thought he was just giving the kid some fun . And they did n't look like they was going to fly . Went just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stunt . I was taken clean by surprise . I do n't even know whether the crate 's got gas enough . If he 's got to set it down anywhere but on a runway it ' 11 fall apart . We do n't use it for anything but the boys and emergencies . " Scotty talked so fast , his words slurred together , and perspirationran down his cheeks . " We 're not blaming you , Scotty , " Ray said when the former came to a pause . " We just want to know what happened . You did n't notice anything unusual about Naylor ? " Scotty frowned and wiped his cheek with the back of his hand . At last he shook his head . " I do n't think so . He  --  well , he looks white with all these tanned fellows around and kind of tense but he always acts O.K. and knows his way around . He was just the same this morning . Kept talking and joking with Billie . That boy sure is nuts about flying . " " So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could tell . ' Course I was n't looking for anythingMurder Makes Us Gay 57and I had a lot of work to do . Ordinarily we do n't let the hotel guests near the planes , but he knew so much about ' em , and Pete swears he was a grand flyer in the  --  well , before , you know . So it seemed all right to let him hang around . " Scotty would have gone on explaining and apologizing indefinitely , but Ray sent him away with a brusk command not to let anyone go near the planes again . He 'd be given two plain-clothes men to help him watch , and together with the rest of the crew that ought to be sufficient to prevent a second slip-up . When the little man had gone Ray leaned back and lit a cigarette . For several minutes he smoked in silence while Denny and Lou watched with obvious interest . Finally he said : " There 's something very fishy about this case . Maybe I 'm just damned contrary but I ca n't see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , should have shot Banks . He sticks out like a sore thumb . And everybody I 've talked to is convinced Naylor is guilty . " " That 's because he 's new to the place . Better him than somebody you 've been drinking with and telling all your business to , " Denny replied promptly . " Yes , but " Hey , Captain , Joe 's spotted Mrs Leighton on her way out . Should he nab her ? " Nolan 's pug face was distorted with excitement as he stuck only his head in the door , ready to bounce off again . " Yes , have him bring her here , " Ray answered , and when Nolan had disappeared he explained , " Mrs Leighton has been inaccessible all morning . First she had a faint , then hysterics , then another faint and finally was supposed to be asleep . I set Hinds to watch her rooms . She could n't endure staying cooped up " He broke off as Mrs Leighton appeared betweenNolan and Hinds. 58 Murder Makes Us GayBoth detectives had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surroundings . Denny had often seen this metamorphosis between " back stairs and front parlor " and been amused by it . Hinds ushered Mrs Leighton gravely and sedately to a seat in front of the desk . Ray half rose and then dropped back into the swivel chair . " See here , my good man , " Polly promptly yelled , " you need n't try to bully me . I wo n't stand for it , and Mr Paine wo n't allow it . I ca n't understand how a man like you is in charge of the case anyway . You . . . " Her voice rode on , filling the room with din . Hinds and Nolan had vanished . Ray was examining the quantity of lead in his Eversharp pencil . Lou was trying to evaporate because she was certain that if Polly were to become aware of her presence she would have her fired for unbecomingconduct . Denny occupied the window sill and was reflectingthat the perfection of Polly 's face and accouterments showed she had been neither hysterical nor faint for the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the powder did not quite conceal the black circles about her eyes , but otherwise she was the smart , the high-spirited , the impossible Polly . She talked until out of sheer curiosity she stopped . Fluttering her blackened lashes she added : " Well ? What do you want of me ? " Ray , having solved the question of lead , put his pencil away . His level black gaze made her fidget . She crossed and uncrossed her legs and needlessly smoothed her gown . " Naturally I want to talk about your son-in-law 's death . You know all about it and are certain Will Naylor shot him . However , before we can convict him we have to have a case . Sufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the man is guilty . You , as an intelligent woman , must realize this . So I 'll have to ask you some questions . I haveMurder Makes Us Gay 59been told that since Naylor arrived there has been a general disturbance in the atmosphere . Now " I should say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upset , and as was only to be expected he  --  well , he was short with everyone . Even Mr Chester had to put up with unjust reprimands . And I myself was a victim of the most undeserved criticism . So you can see from this just how upset Mr Banks was . " She smoothed her strange , carrot-colored hair and carefully dabbed at the corners of her mouth . She had cultivated the knack of holding her chin up so as to smooth out the crepy folds beneath it . This posture slightly improved her chin line , but it caused the bony point of her jaw to become unattractivelyprominent . It also gave her a bellicose expression , which was the last thing poor Polly wanted , Denny reflected . " I 've heard that he spoke about Mr Korne 's shortcomings and ordered you to shed him . " " Do n't be vulgar , " Polly snapped , her eyes matching her voice . " Who told you such nonsense ? " " The walls have ears , " Ray remarked with a smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deny it . " " Well , what of it ? It has nothing whatsoever to do with this dreadful murder . " " You do n't want to give me the details ? " " Certainly not . Harold just did n't like Monte . There 's nothing else to it . " " What time did you go to bed last night ? " Ray asked abruptly . Polly blinked . " I ? Why , why I really do n't know . I did n't look at the clock . Some time after three . " " When the party broke up did you go right to your room ? " " No . I walked along the terrace with Monte . " " Would you guess that you were back in your room by three-thirty ? " 6o Murder Makes Us Gay " I do n't know what time it was . " " Did Mr Korne take you to your room ? " So simple a question apparently required thought . At last she replied : " No . We parted in the lobby . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " No . If I had I should have given an alarm , " she said snippishly . " It 's very warm in here . Ca n't you turn on the fan ? " Ray wordlessly obliged her . As he went back to the desk he reached for the telephone and asked for a Mr Reynolds to come and to bring with him Mr Korne . Polly sat up with a jerk . " What do you want with him ? He has nothing to do with this . He is the sweetest , kindest person . It 's ridiculous for you " Mrs Leighton , if you 'll stop telling me how to do my job it ' 11 be a big help , " Ray said calmly . " Since you do n't want to help I 'll call on people who do want to . " " Mr Reynolds , I suppose ? " she asked sarcastically . " He among others . " Mr Reynolds was a rotund , artless guest who became tipsy very easily . He was a passionate gambler and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good deal of money . When he came in that morning he was an entirely different Mr Reynolds from the one Denny knew . Still rotund but no longer artless . He used to amble about with a giddy amiability but now he was terse and very matter-of-fact . Polly scrutinized him thoroughly and no doubt noticed the change in him . She was torn between curiosity and apprehension . Monte Korne scarcely noticed her , which was also unsettling . He appeared to have eyes only for Mr Reynolds . Ray asked them to be seated and then invited Reynolds to proceed . Evidently the latter knew what was expected ofMurder Makes Us Gay 6 ihim , for he launched into a swift , concise narrative . With a little bow to Polly he said apologetically : " I 'm a private detective . Mr Banks sent for me with detailedinstructions as to what I was to do . My assignment was to pose as a guest and to take Mr Korne under observation . Mr Banks believed he was one of the light-fingered gentry . " At this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but neither did . Polly sat with her mouth open while Korne stared blankly at the floor . " I have made numerous notes on the situation which proved Mr Banks ' suspicions to be well founded . When I gave these to him yesterday afternoon he called Mr Korne , and we had an unpleasant half-hour which ended by Mr Korne being requested to leave the island . " " Oh , Monte , how could you ? " Polly wailed . " Why did n't you ask me for the money ? I 'd have given it to you . " Korne raised his head and favored Polly with an eloquent , liquid glance which informed her that never , never could he stoop to such a thing . His buck teeth rather spoiled the effect , but Polly did n't notice them , and if Banks had determined to separate his too-young mother-in-law from the dubious Monte Korne his wish was n't to be granted . For in a flash Polly had convinced herself with an amazing lack of logic that in addition to being sweet and kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present just how Monte Korne would be able to transform grand larceny into an act of desperation inspired by the desire to stay near the beloved Polly . Reynolds looked down his nose . " Mr Korne resented the order to leave and told Mr Banks what he thought of him . Mr Banks did likewise , and I left , since my share in the situation was over . " Ray asked then , keeping his eyes on the inarticulate Korne , " When next did you see Mr Korne ? " 62 Murder Makes Us GayReynolds replied solemnly , " Last night at three-thirty in the corridor leading to the casino . He was going toward the roulette room . " " Now , Mr Korne , will you tell us what you were doing there ? " Korne showed no distress . He said quietly , " I was n't there . Mr Reynolds is mistaken . At that time I was with Polly . " " What ? " Reynolds shouted , lifted out of his chair with indignation . " Are you calling me a liar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I was not mistaken , " Reynolds declared fiercely . " You must have been since I was n't there , " Monte insisted equally fiercely . " But I tell you I saw him , " Reynolds reiterated . " I was n't mistaken . " " You saw my back . I 'm not the only black-haired man in the hotel , and my size is quite ordinary . I was wearing the same type of evening clothes a hundred other men were wearing last night . Do I have any particular mannerisms whereby you identified me ? " Reynolds was stumped but undefeated . He repeated stubbornly , " It was you all right . " Ray put an end to the argument by saying , " All right , we 'll drop that for the time being . Did either of you see where Mr Banks went when he left the party ? Was he in company ? " " He went with Laura and the Setons , " Polly replied haughtily . " Monte and I went out on the terrace as I told you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " It 's very peculiar that of the twenty people in the room not one knows where Mr Banks went . " " Well , he might have just wandered off . Everyone does around here . " At this point Lieutenant Conrad came in to report . He took in the situation and was on the point of retreating when RayMurder Makes Us Gay 63abruptly dismissed the trio . Polly flew to Monte and clutched his arm . Reynolds withdrew reluctantly . When all three were gone Conrad said : " No word from Naylor . Has n't landed at the regular field . We 've about finished the routine business . Decker is finishing the last batch . Looks like the whole hotel had a good night 's rest . So far nothing to poke holes in . Doc wants to know if you 've got any objections if they take the body now . The boat 's leaving with a load of baggage , and it might as well go along with that . " When he had Ray 's consent he continuedbluntly , " They 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and those are Banks ' . The rest of the room is lousy with ' em . You ca n't get much of a lead from that , but your guess about the chair seems pretty good . Those are bloodstainson the arm of it . I 'd say he was shot there and then heaved under the table , though the devil knows why . " " To hide him . " Ray spoke impatiently , as though he had gone far ahead of Conrad 's slow exposition . " They did n't want him found until morning . " " But why ? " " I 'll know a lot when I know that , " Ray replied shortly . He was beginning to show the strain of his all-night vigil . Conrad fingered his pipe , shot Ray a look and then remarked : " Well , I guess I 'll get me some food . It 's noontime . " " My God ! " Denny ejaculated . " I 've got to get out of here . I 'd forgotten all about the band . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hall with Lou trotting behind him . He ran his hand over his chin , but the stubble was not reassuring . He 'd have to take time to shave . " Lou , be a good scout and tell Jim I 'll be five minutes late . Tell him  --  oh , never mind  --  do n't tell him anything . He knows all the answers . " 64 Murder Makes Us GayLou signified that she understood . When they came to the rotunda she dashed down the hall that led to the rear of the building while Denny made for his room . He half hoped that the death in the house would put a ban on the music making but he suspected Paine would n't allow it . He nicked himself a couple of times in his haste , which did n't improve his mood . When he arrived on the terrace , spruce enough and with the usual required boutonniere , he found the dancing floor was crowded . Jim Baxter favored Denny with a distinctly sour look . He could n't tolerate tardiness , and Denny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disguise the bleeding nicks , was definitely below par . Teddy , the curly-haired drummer , grinned at Denny as he took his place . " Laugh , clown , laugh , " he muttered while he bounced around on his seat . " On with the dance , though your heart be breaking . " " Shut up , " Denny replied as out of the corner of his eye he saw Jim 's thunderous expression . They played three numbers and then , when the crowd kept clapping , two encores . After that Jim ignored them , and the couples sauntered back to their tables . " Murder makes us gay , " Teddy said , continuing his monologue . " What 's the big idea ? The callousness of Denny kicked him in the shin , whereupon he lapsed into an injured silence , concealed behind Denny 's broad back . Jim had come up and was looking his reproof . Denny accepted it meekly . " I thought we 'd be in mourning today , " he remarked . Jim merely handed the notes to Denny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practiced it this morning . " Denny felt his ears burn . He 'd even forgotten that Jim had called a special rehearsal . Something he did once in a blueMurder Makes Us Gay 65moon . Well , a man is n't murdered every day . That ought to be a valid excuse . Except for the suppressed excitement in the atmosphere , the hotel life was going on as usual . The scene was just the same with the same cliques sitting together , the same routine of chatter , laughter and drink . The gay young things , the sedate old things and the smart in-between things carrying out their various performances . The only really big change was the fact that Polly and Monte did n't do the rhumba . The hour ran over to one-thirty , and people still thronged the terrace when the musicians put up their instruments and strode off for their lunch . Jim remarked to Denny : " Chesty was sure the season would be killed . It looks like just the opposite . Guests were getting bored . Now they 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't get scared off by a little murder . If anything , it ' 11 give the season a lift . " Denny agreed with him , and the afternoon proved he was right . Not only reporters arrived by the boatloads , but there was a sudden request for rooms . Paine , of course , did nothing to discourage the trade , and Ray had no reason to forbid new arrivals . At four Denny found Ray sequestered in his room in the village and surrounded by reports . The air was blue with smoke . When Denny came in his set expression relaxed . He folded his arms behind his head and indulged in a tremendous stretch . " Phew ! I never met up with a case like this one . " Denny undid his tie and unbuttoned his shirt before he sat down . " It 's as hot as hell in here and stinks too . How can you think ? " Ray looked surprised and sniffed . " Oh , that smell is from the landlady . Something she cooks . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , I guess you can get used to anything , " Denny admitted . " Tell me about the case . Any news from Naylor ? " Ray brought down his arms and leaned over his notes . " Not yet . I 'm surprised , because McLaughlin has sent out a description of him , and it ca n't be difficult to recognize that setup . Even if he fell between here and the mainland there must be hundreds of boats that could have spotted him . But what gets me is why the devil he wanted to do a crazy stunt like that . " He shuffled his papers impatiently . " With nobody around who could fit the role of murderer as well as he does he would have to play right into their hands . " " So you do n't think he did it ? " " I 'm not saying what I think . Whether he did or did n't he 's playing into their hands . " Ray flicked the sheets with his fingers and then inspected his cigarette . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Denny stopped rocking his chair and brought it down with a bang . " How come ? " " Paine . He thinks this is too big a job for me . Told me himself . Said I was n't accustomed to cases like this . " " I hope you told him to go to hell . What does he know about your record ? " " This has n't got anything to do with my record . " Ray ran his fingers through his smooth black hair . " Maybe McLaughlin wo n't take it from you . He 'll just collaborate . " Ray 's lip curled . " You do n't know McLaughlin . He 's tops and knows it . And he sent over his best men . Do you suppose that was because he loves me ? No , because he expects to come himself and wants good men working for him . Nobody 's going to take chances of Coral Island and the Alhambra getting a bad name for unsolved murders . They are going to find out who shot Banks and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Makes Us Gay 67everybody that you ca n't get away with anything on Coral Island . " " That 's no reason not to give you a chance . " " Well , I can string along . " Denny went back to the rocking again . He had a fairly good idea without asking questions as to how Paine had behaved , and the knowledge stirred up his temper . It made him particularly sore to see Ray 's bitter expression . " You are in on the ground floor . That helps , does n't it ? " " Certainly . There is n't much to puzzle over this time . In fact , the routine business moved along on greased skids . Oh , there are a few points still to clear up , but they will be in time . We have n't found the gun . The men have made a pretty good search for it  --  as good as they could . There are several people with not-so-good alibis , but so far there 's nothing to connect them with the shooting . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coates says she is suffering from prostration and ca n't be disturbed . " Ray shrugged . " Maybe it 's so and maybe it is n't . Banks ' lawyer is flying down from New York . He 'd been called by Mrs Banks before I could do it . Probably Paine instructedher . Paine is bossing everybody  --  except me . " Denny smoked in silence , waiting for Ray to continue . But he did n't . He went into a prolonged brown study from which Denny roused him by asking plaintively : " Do you have to go into a huddle with yourself ? I 'm waiting to hear more . " " I have n't any more to tell you unless you want to hear all the dopey answers I got to my questions . " The drone of a plane directly overhead startled them both . Ray sprang up , sending his chair to the floor with a crash , and flung himself halfway out of the window . Denny even grabbed hold of Ray 's trousers because he thought he was going all the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's massive back and finally spotted the plane low over the village . Since68 Murder Makes Us Gaynone of the regular pilots brought the taxis to this end of the island it was logical to suppose it was someone who was n't accustomed to landing on the small field . Ray suddenly backed into the room , his rear portion contactingvigorously with Denny 's stomach . " It 's the little one all right . My God , if it were Naylor ! Would that give me a laugh on Paine ! Come on . " Ray added insult to injury by nearly knocking Denny off his feet as he plunged across the room and out of the house . Denny had only one foot in the car when Ray started it . " That 's right , give me a black eye on top of everything else , " Denny shouted as he sank into his seat , but not before he had kissed the windshield with his forehead . " I want to get hold of him before anybody else does , " Ray explained , keeping his eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then began to settle as Ray drove the car ruthlessly across the bumpy , roadless beach . VINAYLOR WAS ALREADY ON THE GROUND WHEN THEYreached the field . Men closed in on him from all sides , but he walked straight ahead as though he did not see them . He was stopped only by Ray 's planting himself directly in his path . The two men eyed each other wordlessly until Ray said : " Come along to my place . " Naylor rubbed a hand over his bloodshot eyes and dumbly followed Ray . At the sight of the disheveled Denny he managed a twisted smile . " Hello , pal . On the welcoming committee ? " " This ai n't nothing . Wait until you see the reception you get at the hotel . " Naylor sat between Ray and Denny . His face was so gaunt the bones seemed about ready to come through the skin . His abundant hair , all on end , made his face look all the thinner . Denny felt like an ox beside Naylor and wondered how he kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coburn 's house , 6970 Murder Makes Us Gayand when they were in the room Ray went out again . After a while he returned with some coffee and sandwiches which he placed in front of Naylor . The latter stared at the food and then at Ray who was engrossed in lighting a cigarette . " You must be a mind reader , " he said at last . He began to eat with ravenous hunger . Denny sneaked a look at his watch and found it was ten of five . At five he was supposed to be at the hotel . Ray was in no hurry to make Naylor talk . He sat , complacently smoking , his face as blank as a Buddha 's . Denny went into the bedroom and with the aid of Ray 's belongings made himself presentable . He kept his ear cocked and when Ray broke the long silence he made for the room in double-quick time . Ray was saying , " How about telling me what 's behind this stunt ? And where is Billie ? " Naylor still looked dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I took him to the Ames Cadet School . Wilbur Ames is about the only friend I have . He did what I wanted and did n't ask a lot of questions . Billie does n't know about Banks being shot . " " Oh , so you do . I was wondering . " Naylor met Ray 's cynical eyes unflinchingly . " Of course I do . That 's why I took Billie away . Do n't you suppose I know what they 're saying around here ? I did n't want him to hear it , that 's all . At the aviation academy he 'll have plenty to keep him amused and interested , and the boys there wo n't know much about what 's happening here . Ames will keep an eye on Billie . " " So that 's the only reason you took the ride ? " Naylor shrugged wearily . " What other reason would I have ? I want to have a chance with the kid , and if he stayedMurder Makes Us Gay 71around here he 'd hear nothing good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and others . I want a chance to fight for myself . " Ray drew elaborate designs on the pad in front of him . Thus far he had been unresponsive . Now he asked : " Why are you so certain he 'd hear you being accused ? " Naylor laughed . " Do n't waste time being adroit . You know , and I know that I had every reason in the world to wish Banks dead . He has my wife , my child ; he 's got my record to use against me in case I fight for the child and he is the type to use it . Why would n't I be glad he 's dead ? Who 's got a better motive than I ? Who 's got a better reputation than I have to do the shooting ? Jail does n't make softies out of men . You learn a lot of things there you never thought of before . I have n't talked about this murder to anybody since I heard the night clerk crying about it but I 'm willing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the murderer . " His deep-set eyes met Ray 's mockingly . It was easy to read the answer in the latter 's face . " Oh well , you know how these people are , " Denny interposedquickly . " They jump to conclusions and " Exactly and I do n't want Billie to hear those conclusions or take part in the bloody mess . I do n't suppose it 'll do much good to say I did n't shoot Banks , though I hated his guts . " Naylor 's voice was harsh with emotion . Again Denny remembered the scene between him and Laura . " No , I 'm afraid it wo n't help much , " Ray said earnestly . " Not unless you have an ironclad alibi for three-thirty . Or rather say from a quarter past three to a quarter of four . " Naylor put his hands to his temples and rubbed them pensively . Then he smoothed down his unruly hair . " I do n't suppose I have . I was wandering around . I didn't72 Murder Makes Us Gaynotice any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I woke up about six . " " Yes , but what about three-thirty ? " " You got me there . I ca n't tell you a thing . " " You were just wandering , eh ? " " Well , I walked along the terrace , I remember , and through the gardens and along the shore  --  I did n't pay much attention . You ought to remember I was n't exactly calm . " " That was at one . Two hours is plenty of time to cool off . " " Sure . I do n't suppose I was as mad at three as I was at one but I was still plenty mad . " " Did n't you meet anyone while you were going the rounds ? " Denny asked impatiently . " My God , there 's always somebody awake in this place . " " I may have but I do n't remember . " " You 're not trying to help yourself much , " Ray said sternly . " Listen , I 've been cracking my head ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you suppose if I had any ideas I 'd hand them to you on a platter ? I do n't know these people . I do n't know what Banks has been doing the past seven years . All I can say , it was a big surprise to me to find him such an important personage . Seven years ago he was only a successful automobile salesman . Successful for those days . There was nothing spectacular about him , nothing to hint that he 'd one day be the manager of a place like this . " " That was due only to one lucky idea , " Denny explained belittlingly . " After that he hired assistants who knew their jobs ten times better than he did , and everything was a cinch . Do n't give him too much credit . " " In any case , I ca n't have any ideas about him unless I know what he 's been doing . You must know that . Have n't you any ideas ? " Ray 's expression was not encouraging . " I could give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Us Gay 73associates . I 've been here two seasons , and one was just like the other , except that the war has made this one bigger and better than the other . Banks did n't get intimate with anyone , or if he did he was so clever about it , even the help did n't know , and I do n't believe that 's possible . He was inclined to be reserved and undemonstrative . He hated Mrs Leighton , I think , because he wanted to surround himself with dignity and respect , and Polly spoiled the show every time . Besides , she 's goofy about young or youngish men and seems to be on the verge of marrying Monte Korne . You 've met him . The 1941 version of a 1928 gigolo . He was another pet hate of Banks . The only other people who were intimate with him were Gerald Morrison and Princess Clementina . She 's rather a riddle to me . In fact , both of them are . I 've often wondered whether Morrison is any relation to Polly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Naylor supplied curtly . " So that 's where I saw him , " Denny said as a great light dawned in his memory . " At your trial . Sure , only he has changed a lot . Shows the wear and tear of fast living . " Naylor smiled sardonically but made no comment . Ray continued with his resume . " As far as I can ascertain , Banks ' dealings with everyone else were superficial , except of course with Chesty and the chief assistants of the hotel , about eight in all . Most of the staff never saw him , except in the distance as a power to be feared . They are much more worried about their immediate superiors than they are about Banks who ca n't tell one from the other . With the guests Banks had to exercise very particular precautions to give just the right amount of attention to the various types of guests . He was very good at it . He has a knack for knowing people . " " Must be from the practice he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be . Of course this whole outfit was one of those74 Murder Makes Us Gaycrazy gambles that happen every once in a while , like the Blue Heron . Some men with a lot of money to invest and somebody with an idea that sounds good "  --  Ray spread his hands  --  " and there you are . If it were n't for the war this would n't be the success it is : it 's got a lot of foreign atmosphere with all the American conveniences . People with money want to have fun spending it , and so Banks was a success . Lots of people who had n't been up in a plane took a chance in the taxis . They sound familiar , and it 's only a short ride . " " It must cost a hell of a lot of money , " Naylor said with sudden interest . " Banks takes care of that in the rates , " Denny explained . " And now I 've got to beat it . Jim will probably have gone completely sour by now . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost dim past when he was a green young lawyer , full of legal dreams and court ambitions . When the Naylor case had come his way , mostly because it was just another case not worth Brabant and Voorhees ' immediate attention , he had tackled it with tremendous vigor . Of course later on Mr Brabant had handled the case and lost it , much to Denny 's chagrin . Naylor had had a crack-up in a plane the day before the automobile accident . He had been instructing a student , and when they came down the student had been killed , while Naylor had been only bruised . That had been the first piece of bad luck . he had brooded over it and ended up by getting drunk . Prohibition had just been repealed . Brabant had pleaded that Naylor had always been a sober man during the dry days and as a result had n't much practice in drinking . A little would go a long way . But everyone had felt the blame rested squarely on Naylor , and he should be made to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fellow who seemed too despondent and too overcome by his terrible guilt to say anything in his self-defense . SomeMurder Makes Us Gay 75people , Denny decided , were just born unlucky , and Will Naylor happened to be one of them . It was at this point of his meditations that Denny came upon the two Setons sitting alone , their heads together in earnest consultation . They were ordinarily the most high spiritedand lively of the young , favored group , so that their mournful aspect caught Denny 's attention . Mary was white and anxious , and Tony was apparently giving her brotherly advice to " buck up . " At the sight of Denny Mary started guiltily , but Tony 's face lighted with relief . " Oh , hello , there . I did n't see you come , " he said blithely . " Mary 's in a stew because she overheard a telephone conversationyesterday which she thinks might have some bearing on Banks ' death . However , she 's a squeamish kid who 's scared of helping the murderer get caught and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a killer 's death . So she ca n't settle with her conscience one way or the other . " Mary made a face at her brother . " You make me sound like a fool . " " I can see your viewpoint , Miss Seton , " Denny said soothingly . " But if a man killed once he might kill again , and that 's why you should tell all you know . " Mary looked skeptical . " He would n't kill anybody else , if Banks was the man he hated . Why should he ? It 's bad enough to kill one man without killing two . I 'm sure he 's wishing he had n't even killed one . " " She 's incorrigible , " Tony remarked , eying his sister with fraternal tolerance . " She 's got a code all of her own . When I talk to her about duty she 's stone deaf and then she flies off and does the most fantastic things without rhyme or reason just because some obscure instinct tells her she ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary insisted . " It might  --  might throw suspicion on some innocent person . " 76 Murder Makes Us GayDenny discerned the underlying tone of anxiety in her voice . She knew a good deal more than she was saying , and the responsibility was too much for the bit of fluff she was . As Denny scrutinized her pretty face he had a sudden hunch why Mary was so upset , and then his own spirits took a drop . " Do you know to whom Banks was speaking ? " " No , I do n't . He did n't mention any names . It was one of those one-sided conversations that do n't make much sense unless you put two and two together . " " Why do n't you tell me about it ? And that ' II act as a sort of confessional . Then I 'll pass along the information if it seems important . " They sat there in the purple dusk beneath the softly rustling palms . " I do n't know . I do n't know , " Mary fretted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end , and they 'll try to make me say more than I know and they 'll get me confused , and then I 'll say things I 'll be sorry for afterward . I 'm not very bright , you know , " she confided with adorable candor . Under her elaborate hair-do and mundane getup she was still half a child . " If I do n't say anything the police can find out about the call themselves . It 's their job . " " All the same , it 's bothering you , " Tony pointed out . " So you better get it off your chest . " " Well , make up your mind , " Denny said , " because I 've got to go . If you do n't want to tell me tell Ray  --  Captain Coburn . He 'll " Oh no , no , I 'd rather tell you . I 'm sort of afraid of him . His eyes always go straight through you . Well , here goes . The day Mr Banks was shot I went into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , and that 's why I went , because I was looking for some of those painted post cards they have of the Alhambra . Sketches , they arc . I thought one might still be in the desks there . Anyway , while I was rumMurderMakes Us Gay 77maging through the drawers I noticed somebody was using the telephone booth in the hallway . It 's sort of dark there , and the person had n't closed the door , so the light was n't on , but I 'm sure it was Mr Banks . I recognized his voice . " " She 's getting to the point now , " Tony said mischievously . Mary flared . " Oh , you ! It 's easy for you to laugh . You do n't " What happened next ? " Denny asked with one eye on his watch . " Well , I thought I must look awfully silly going through all the desks so I just sat down and began to write a letter to my niece . But Banks did n't notice me at all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my direction . " " And the call ? " " Well , he said something about discussing something . We can discuss it then , ' he said , or words like those . We want to get this settled once and for all , ' and then something about after the party in the casino and it being private . I was n't listening so I ca n't remember all of the call . But I do know he was making a date with somebody to meet him in the casino after a party which I suppose was Tina 's . " " That 's pretty serious , is n't it ? " Tony asked . " If the call is traced the other person will have a lot of explaining to do . " Denny got up . He did n't want the Setons to see how serious he thought it was . " What time was this call ? " he inquired . " About four , or so . Afterward I came out for cocktails , so it must have been between four and five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone instead of his office or room one ? To keep the thing a secret ? But why ? Who 'd care whether he met someone in the casino or not ? Sounds all very mysterious to me . " Tony was inclined to scoff at the whole situation , except that it was an indisputable fact that Banks was suddenly and78 Murder Makes Us Gayunaccountably dead . Denny himself , who had seen the corpse of the immaculate and dignified Harold Banks spread out under the roulette table , found it sometimes difficult to believe that the terrible crime had been committed . The elegant ritual of life in the Alhambra proceeded with its customary smoothness . The whole staff , from Chesty down to the newest bellhop , kept the routine going under Paine 's eagle eye . " I have n't the slightest idea who was at the other end of the wire , " Mary reiterated firmly , " so do n't let any of the police bully me about it . I 've told you all I know . " The cocktail hour seemed endless to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and over in his mind without finding any answer . The Setons had joined another group and were now right merry again . Perhaps , Denny thought glumly , he was a fool to meddle in the business . Why not let Ray or McLaughlin or Conrad worry about it ? Maybe Naylor had told Ray about it , and there was n't any mystery to solve . Finally it was seven , and Denny was released . Teddy looked at him critically . " What 's the matter ? You look terrible . Not grieving for Banks , are you ? Say , one of the big shots came this afternoon . McSomething  --  McLaughlin , that 's it . Took a peek around here before you came in with the Setons . Big , white-haired fellow with a jaw that looks like he uses it to chew iron . Paine was with him . He going to solve the mystery ? Why not Ray ? Is he stalled already ? Everybody 's whispering about the Naylor guy . You know , the father of Billie . Do you " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tramped off , leaving the astonished drum player staring after him . VIITHE FIRST PERSON DENNY MET ON THE WAY TO THEvillage bar was Lou . She had been sitting on the bank , evidentlywaiting for him , and scrambled down to meet him . For once her face was earnest and her brown eyes without laughter . " Oh , Denny , what 's happening ? Do you know ? I saw Ray only for a second , and he was fierce . The police chief has come over , and he 's established one of his men in our office . I 'm scared . " " Do n't be , angel . That 's just a front . McLaughlin is n't a devil . He only looks like one . Had any dinner ? " " No . I  --  did n't want any . Do you think they 'll arrest Naylor ? They 've taken him up to the hotel . That 's why Ray was so mad . " " Well , let 's get a drink and then eat , and maybe we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " I feel terrible because it does look as though the only person who could have done it is798o Murder Makes Us GayNaylor and I do n't want it to be him because of Billie . Besides , I  --  sort of like him . But Banks was nasty to him , and Paine seems to be positive he 's guilty . Do you think he is , Denny ? " " I wish to God I knew . He swears he is n't . But who else ? " " It would have to be someone close to Banks . There was only his family and a few people he came in contact with . You do n't suppose it could have been Chesty ? I mean professionaljealousy or something ? " Denny laughed . " Chesty ? I ca n't picture him , can you ? " " No , but we 've got to picture somebody if we do n't want Naylor to be accused . You hear such a lot , Denny . Do n't you know any other person ? " By this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lorne huddled in a corner booth . Smiley , noting the direction of Denny 's gaze , held up five fingers . " Come on , let 's join him , " Denny said , pulling Lou with him . Monte had difficulty in focusing his eyes on them and was bristling with resentment that anyone should intrude upon his alcoholic solitude . When he recognized Denny his glance wavered , and he made an effort to pull himself together . " Hello , " Lou greeted him sweetly , though her eyes sought Denny 's uncertainly . " Mind if we sit here ? We 'd like some company . Besides , we want to hear about the murder . " " It 's a dirty trick , " Monte mumbled thickly . His customary blandness had suffered decidedly from the strain of the last few days . " Sure it was , " Denny agreed warmly . " A dirty , underhand trick . " " That 's exactly what it was , " Monte said , peering at Denny with glassy eyes . He did not look very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his thick black hair had undergone the sage treatment . Murder Makes Us Gay 81 " But you would n't kill him for it , would you ? " Denny asked slyly . Monte hiccuped . " Of course I did n't kill him . Why should I ? You 've got to have a reason , do n't you ? " He leered at Denny as he drank up his whisky . " It 's customary . Though you might do it in a rage after the dirty trick he played on you . " Monte concentrated on this for several minutes and then replied vaguely : " Rage . That 's it . Everybody was in a rage . Polly and Haroldand Laura and  --  that  --  that goddamned Naylor . He started the whole thing , he did . " Monte rapped on the table and waved his glass at Smiley . Then he shoved his hands into his pockets and slid down on the bench until his feet were under Lou 's seat . " Damn Naylor , " he kept muttering to himself . " Polly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why ? " " Lousy temper , thassall . Just lousy temper . Because of Naylor . He just got fed up . He was a rotten sport . " " Did n't he want you to marry Polly ? " Lou expected Monte to resent Denny 's direct questions , but Monte was beginning to find the world very foggy . He caught only wisps of Denny 's queries and had difficulty in hanging on to those . " Polly . Marry Polly . That 's a good idea , but try and do it . Not with Banks sitting round watching . Poor Polly . She 's scared all right . " " About what ? Does she think you shot Banks ? " Monte failed entirely to grasp this question . He was trying to light a cigarette and when he was finally successful the smoke seemed to bring his wits back from the foggiest depths . He stared loweringly at Denny and said slowly : " There 's something funny about the whole family . Yes sir. 82 Murder Makes Us GayEspecially Banks . Now I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I never saw a manager like him . No sir . I did n't . Just a low-down rat . When you get around the way I have you get to know people . That 's what he was . A despicable character . " " What gives you that idea ? " Denny asked in surprise . " I know , " Monte replied mysteriously . " Was he up to any tricks ? " Monte did not answer . " You know , Denny , " Lou said pensively , " there 's nothing here , in the hotel or on the island , that fits to murder . Not the right properties , you might say . Of course there 's the casino , but Banks would n't let the stakes go too high , and when a customer began to lose too heavily he gave the sign for the game to close . Everybody knows that , and the people here can afford to lose without killing either themselves or Banks . He was so reserved . Almost bourgeois in his respectability . " " How about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their relationship . Was the old boy falling for her ? I admit she 's got attractions . " " Jerry Morrison is crazy about her . They 're always together . They were last season too . Eleanor says the general belief is they are more than friends in private . So where would Banks come in ? Besides , he was as unemotional as a fish . " Denny had to admit that there was little food for suspicion in any of them . " I suppose , " Lou said , breaking the silence , " McLaughlin will get right down to the bottom of it . He is from the outside and would be able to size up the situation with an unbiased eye . " If Paine lets him , " Denny replied . Monte decided he had had enough of his present surroundingsand unceremoniously took his leave . Murder Makes Us Gay 83 " These guys ! " Smiley said in disgust to Denny . " What are they living for ? " " Same as us  --  to eat , sleep and be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old lady to make a fool of herself , " Smiley declared virtuously . " I 'm beginning to be hungry . Can I have some peanuts ? " Lou asked . " No , we 're going back for dinner . But first let 's see if Ray is home and why he was so mad . Come on . " They found Ray in his room , and with him was Laura 's maid Katy . She looked up with fright as the two entered , but the sight of Lou was reassuring . " Shall we clear out again ? " Denny asked , hoping Ray would say no . Katy , always so staid and proper , replied before Ray could : " Oh , I 'll be going in a minute , sir . I was only telling the Captain that I was worried about my mistress . She acts so strange , and now with that Mr McLaughlin here I was terrified for her , I was . " Her gray eyes were anxious , showing how much she was in need of comfort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure you would n't say anything about it . In the hotel a body ca n't breathe withoutthe whole staff knowing it . They do talk too much , for all the ruling against it . And after the terrible fight Mrs Leightondid have with that Mr Naylor , and yelling so as the whole floor could hear , there 's just no end to the talk . " " I heard that fight , " Lou said , sitting on the arm of Katy 's chair . " It was a beaut . ' " Katy nodded sadly . ' Es Mrs Leighton who talks too much . Many a time she acts more like a small child than a grown woman . " She leaned forward and lowered her voice . " The afternoon of the day he was killed there was a dreadful fuss in the apartment . Mrs Leighton was crying she would kill84 Murder Makes Us Gayherself , and Mr Banks was saying for her not to be a fool and to give him the gun . ' T was a regular family row , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Are you sure he said gun ' ? " Ray asked skeptically . " Indeed , I am sure , " Katy replied . " I 'm not one to make idle talk or think up tales to be amusing . I leave that to the scatterbrained young ones . " " I wondered because I asked Mrs Banks whether her husbandowned a revolver and I asked Mr Chester . Both said no . " Well , perhaps it was the old lady 's gun . Did you ask her ? " " No , I did n't but I will , especially since you told me about their quarrel . " " You wo n't be saying I told you ? " Katy asked nervously . " I only want you to help my mistress . That 's why I 'm telling you this , not to tattle and make trouble . " Ray nodded understandingly . After a moment he said gently , " You do n't have any ideas about this business , have you , Katy ? " The maid 's plump face went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then she overcame her excitement enough to reply firmly : " That I do n't , Mr Coburn . ' Tis n't for me to think up no-tions . " " You never happened to overhear anything that would lead you to think Mr Banks had enemies ? Either inside the hotel or out ? " Again Katy shook her head . " He was a hard man and very ambitious . He would never take no for an answer , but I never heard him do anybody harm . He  --  was n't much of a father to the boy , if you know what I mean , but then Billie did n't take to him either . And in a way I do n't blame the boy . Children have often more sense than grown folk , " Katy concluded significantly . Murder Makes Us Gay 85 " So you do n't see any reason why he should have been killed ? " " Not unless he was very underhanded . " " Do you think he could be ? " Katy pursed her lips . She exuded such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great faith in her opinions . Finally she said : " Well , that is a hard question to answer . A man like Mr Banks do n't wear his thoughts on his sleeve . There 's one thing I will say , he was n't a frank and openhearted man . Whether he was just keeping his business to himself or whether he was being underhanded , I could not say . No word has ever come to my ear that he was anything but honest . " A pause followed this painstaking explanation , which Denny broke with a rather surprising question : " Would you say Mr Banks loved his wife ? " Katy stiffened . Her gray eyes darkened dangerously . " Why would you be asking me a question like that ? " Denny felt uncomfortable beneath her scathing scrutiny . Lou also was staring at him . He said lamely : " I have a reason . I  --  I just wanted to know . They never impressed me as being very fond of each other . At least  --  they never showed it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she resented the indirect slur he was throwing on her lady 's charms . " Aside from the quarrel Mrs Leighton had with him , did anything else happen on that day ? Tell me any little thing that was unusual , even if you ca n't see its importance . " " Well , my worry really started that day because my mistress was crying before dinner . ' T is a thing she 's never done before , being always so quiet and reserved . It gave me a fair shock , though she did try to hide it from me . I told myself it was being upset over the boy and his father , but she 'd been that for two days without crying . Since then it 's just gone from86 Murder Makes Us Gaybad to worse till I 'm clean out of my wits . I 've been right bold in talking to her , but she never gives me a fair answer . She 's most terrible upset over something , and if that mighty man takes her in hand he 'll just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working herself into such an anxiety that she was on the verge of tears . Lou patted her affectionately while Ray sat frowning . Denny wanted to ask several questions , but he was afraid to . He tried to use mental telepathy and was delighted when Ray put one of those he had in mind . " Do you think Mrs Banks knows something about the shooting , and that 's what is bothering her ? " " It may be , but do n't you go thinking she shot her husband . My mistress would n't do a thing like that . " Ray thought her faith pathetic . He had seen just such a blazing look of faith and loyalty in the tired eyes of mothers who believed their sons could do no evil , when said sons had already committed the worst of crimes . He himself was not at all certain that Laura could do no evil . He had learned early in this game to distrust even the fairest face . " Mrs Leighton now  --  she would be one to forget herself . Often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady should , " Katy said primly . Lou winked at Denny , who had a hard time keeping his face straight . " Mrs Banks is devoted to her mother , is n't she ? " Ray asked . " That she is , more than most daughters would be , " Katy replied angrily , forgetting her self-imposed discretion . " More than I should ever have been , were I in her shoes . The old lady is enough to try the patience of a saint , yet my mistress never says a harsh word . Pampers the old lady , she does . That 's what I say . Many 's the times I 've wondered how she held her tongue . ' T was a hard thing for me to hold my own . " Murder Makes Us Gay 87 " Did Mrs Banks oppose Mrs Leighton 's marriage to Monte Korne ? " " W-e-11 , the fact is , she did n't like it but she had no liking to talk about it either . And Mr Banks did enough for both of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there Mrs Banks would not preventher mother from marrying ? " " How could she ? Besides , she never is one to stand up to her mother  --  or anyone else , for that matter . Speaks well for the boy he is n't more spoiled , for she never could say no ' to him . " " You ca n't guess as to who Mr Banks was seeing in the casino ? " " Guesses are no good . Only trouble come from them , " Katy replied sternly . " I leave that to others . All I ask is that you find out what 's troubling my lady before she makes herself ill . Or before that big man McLaughlin comes down on her . " " Well , I 'm afraid I ca n't do very much . He 's my superior , you know , and what he says goes . Your mistress was not very obliging when I spoke to her earlier in the day . Perhaps she will be more impressed by McLaughlin . " Katy was properly squelched by the truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to understand , " he continued , " murder is something you ca n't hide like a poor relation or a black sheep of the family . Lying is n't half as easy as most people think . You have to be a damned good liar to fool a man who has years of practice in detecting lies . You might tell your mistress that . She wo n't be able to fool McLaughlin at all . I 'm willing to lay bets on that . Not unless she lies a whole lot better to him than she did to me . " " But how do you know she lied to you ? " Katy asked in a bewildered way . " I know she did . She had a reason for going to the casino . She probably knew her husband was there . " 88 Murder Makes Us GayKaty twisted her fingers and tried to be indignant , but she was too honest to conceal her real feelings . In the end she took refuge in laments . " Ah me , one never knows . There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a feeling in my bones this is only the beginning . " " With McLaughlin on the scene it certainly is , " Ray said dryly . Katy smoothed her gray alpaca dress and straightened its white cuffs and then heaved a great sigh . " Well , I shall do my best to help my mistress , but murder is a terrible thing to be sure . If there is anything you want of me you 'll be asking , I guess . " With that she rose and prepared to go . For a minute her gray eyes rested speculatively on Ray , and then she went out . " Did we miss much ? " Denny asked as soon as the maid was out of earshot . Ray looked tired and grim , very different from the Ray who lolled about on the yellow sands , eating cocoanuts or sleeping . " The most important thing so far is a phone call between Banks and Naylor , " Ray said glumly . " McLaughlin pinned down the operator , who swears she connected Banks and Naylorabout four that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locating Naylor . What are you making faces about ? " he asked as he noticed Lou and Denny exchangingsignificant glances . " Do you know anything about it ? " Ray 's sharpness made Denny describe hastily his meeting with Tony and Mary and the latter 's story about the call . " It 's pretty damning for Naylor , is n't it ? " Lou said , apprehensivelyeying Ray 's stern face . " He 'll have to explain a lot , " Ray admitted , glancing at his watch . " I 'll have to go up to the hotel now for a sessionMurder Makes Us Gay 89with McLaughlin . He 's about ready to roll up his sleeves and begin . " " Does he know anything ? " " Only what Paine told him , and of course he 's had a completereport of what happened so far . " " What did Paine tell him ? " Ray had disappeared into his bedroom while he was talking and now was evidently making himself presentable for the meeting with McLaughlin . He did not answer for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Banks had told him : that Naylor was a peculiar character somewhat unbalanced , and that he was afraid of what he might do to Billie or Mrs Banks . He wanted advice on how he could protect them and get rid of Naylor with the least amount of trouble and scandal . " Denny grunted his disgust . " Swell background for the murder , is n't it ? " " It 's a perfect background , " Ray answered Denny . " If you did n't know Naylor and just heard about this setup would n't you suspect him ? " " He 'd be a damned fool . " " Sure , but most murders are the result of a blowup . There are ten unpremeditated murders to one planned one . People get excited , lose their heads , and if a gun or knife is handy there 's bound to be trouble . If Naylor had an argument with Banks , and Banks , holding all the cards as he did , got disagreeable , it 's very easy to see Naylor going crazy . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd just want to see Banks dead for all he 'd done to him . That 's the way McLaughlin will figure it , " Ray concluded , clapping his hairbrushes together . " And his reasoning would be sound . " " But you do n't believe it 's that way , do you ? " Lou asked , eying Ray 's sleek aspect critically . " I 'm not so sure it could n't have been that way . " 90 Murder Makes Us Gay " But you and I saw him asleep , " Denny objected . Ray turned away . " Yes , but I took the time to go over his room . He has a supply of veronal tablets . They 'd put him to sleep in fifteen minutes . " Lou and Denny sat in solemn silence until Ray joined them again , now arrayed in a freshly laundered linen jacket . He stood looking at them with a faintly pitying expression . " Do n't be too glum about it . It 's just possible I can find another suspect . Now let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few cars on the island , and in this the three started up to the hotel . " As far as McLaughlin goes  --  Naylor 's the murderer  --  and of course it would n't do for me to doubt the great man 's wisdom , " Ray remarked en route . " You do n't like him much , do you ? " Lou asked . She was squeezed between the two , very mussed and very contented . Ray looked down at her , and suddenly a smile brightened his stern face . " No . I 'm jealous . " " Go on , I do n't believe you . Is he a brain picker ? " Ray 's smile deepened . " He likes co-operation and gets it . " They arrived at the hotel , and Ray parked his car beside the string of hotel automobiles that were so seldom used , the guests preferring the more picturesque and indolent locomotionprovided by wheel chairs and bicycles . " Will we see you afterward ? " Denny asked as they climbed out . " If I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Squidat two . O.K. ? " Ray nodded , but his thoughts were already with the " big man . " He left them abruptly , and Lou watched him stride toward the entrance . " You do n't have to look so wistful , " Denny said crossly . " He 's not being thrown to the lions , you know . " " Well , I 'll bet you 'd hate to have to face that bully . EspeMurderMakes Us Gay 91cially if you do n't agree with all he says , and I do n't think Ray believes Naylor killed Banks . " " Remember , he found the veronal . " " But there 's no proof Naylor took it . I 'd just as soon believe Monte shot Banks  --  or Chesty . " " You certainly do n't like the little fellow , do you ? After all , if he wanted to shoot him he could have done it ages ago . " " Ah  --  but then Naylor would n't have been here . Everything seems to have changed in the inner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Probably they all thought that as soon as he was released he would slink away and hide somewhere under a false name . Certainly they had made it plain enough that they did not want to have anything to do with him . Instead , the minute he 's out of jail he comes straight here and plops himself down in the midst of this glory and splendor , surrounded by two hundred odd of the best silk-hat society . It must have been a shock to them . " " I wonder what he hoped to gain by it , aside from seeing Billie , " Denny said . " He could n't hope for much , considering the circumstances . I 'd like to have a talk with Naylor . I 've got several hunches I would want to prove . But first we had better go eat before the dining room closes . " Lou agreed that this would be a sensible idea . VIIIAFTER DINNER LOU RETURNED TO HER OFFICE WHILEDenny went in search of Naylor . He knocked twice and then , instead of going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . He was faced with darkness , and it took him a minute to notice the silhouette framed by the window . " Naylor ? " he asked , feeling something of a fool . The figure started , and then Naylor spoke vaguely : " Oh  --  I did n't hear you . Come in . " He remained sitting by the window , his elbows on his knees and his chin resting on his clasped hands . He paid scant attention to Denny but continued to stare out at the scene spread below him : a wide expanse of moonlit water against which were outlined the feathery crowns of the palm trees . There was a night breeze that whipped up the surf to lay a white border on the black shore . A few of the guests were enjoying the evening by taking rides in the chairs whose lights flickered along the garden paths like fireflies . Denny seated himself opposite Naylor . Now that he was92Murder Makes Us Gay 93here he was at a loss for words . Finally he broke the silence by remarking : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounded sarcastic , which was the last thing he meant to be . Naylor , however , understood his meaning , for he replied : " Yes , it is , " just as though they were continuing a conversation . " It 's hard to believe it 's real after seven years of walls . " " And some of us here get so used to it we do n't even notice its beauty any more . " Naylor pushed a packet of cigarettes toward Denny but otherwise did nothing to make him more at ease . He went back to his contemplation , and the room was again filled with silence . Denny wondered restlessly how he could get at Naylor and at last decided to go back to their first meeting . He recalled the details of it and described his thoughts on the occasion , ending with , " I do n't suppose you remember but " I remember it very well , " Naylor said quietly . Denny was taken back by this reply . He had half believed that Naylor was n't even listening to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't remember about those days . I ca n't forget them even when I want to . I dream about them unless I take dope . " " I was pretty green then "  --  Denny hurried on  --  " but I still think Brabant could have done more for your case . " " He was all right . I was guilty and deserved what I got . I was plenty hot tempered in those days ; I can see that now . I 've had time enough to reflect on my sins . Only a man learns his lessons too late . I 've got a reputation I ca n't live down . " Denny was too clever to contradict him or to offer platitudesabout making a new start . " That may be , " he said , " but there 's no point in letting somebody else use your reputation . " Naylor sat up . " What do you mean by that ? " 94 Murder Makes Us Gay " I mean , if you did n't kill Banks  --  I say if , notice  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hide behind your black rep . I 'd fight him every inch of the way . " " How ? By talking ? " Naylor laughed . " I 'm up to my neck in it now and if I talked I 'd be over my head . You know , I 've got some common sense . " Denny watched the glow of his cigarette tip brighten as he inhaled deeply . For all his calm manner , he was keyed up tight enough to snap . " I 'm not saying you should talk to everyone but I know this place better than you do . You 've met McLaughlin . You know what he 's like . " " He was better than I expected . Treated me halfway decent in spite of Paine . I do n't know . Maybe it 's just a trick to fool me . " Naylor rubbed his hand over his eyes . " I 'm so tired ; sometimes I do n't care if they do get me for it . " " Look here , Banks telephoned you Saturday afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the casino , did n't he ? " Naylor did not answer . " You may as well admit it because Sally , the telephone operator , remembers the call . Did you go ? " Still Naylor remained silent . He sat motionless , and Denny could see his face only dimly . " Well , if you wo n't talk nobody can help you , " Denny said at last impatiently . " Maybe you did shoot him and you 're going to bluff it out . " " I did n't shoot him . " " If you did n't shoot him somebody else did . That 's elementary . Have you got any ideas ? " " No . " " Do n't be so unequivocal . We 've got to find another person who could be guilty . " Murder Makes Us Gay 95 " We ? " There was an undercurrent of mockery in Naylor 's voice . " Yes , we , damn it ! " Denny swore . " I wo n't believe you 're guilty until it 's proved . You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and enough cases to know the obvious is usually a fata morgana . It 's so easy ; it 's a shame it ca n't be true . If I 'd had any breaks I would have specialized in criminal law . Do n't blame me if I get excited about you . It 's my suppressed desires breaking loose . No great calamity will happen if I play your defense counsel for a while , not with McLaughlin and Ray being pillars of the law . You do n't know Ray Coburn as I do . You 're apt to be misled by his smooth , lazy looks . A lot of people are  --  especially women , " Denny added sorely . " But he 's a swell guy underneath . And plenty smart , only he 's scared somebody will find out . He 's on your side or at least he 's neutral . " " I would n't blame him if he was n't , " Naylor said , hunchingover again . " I was a fool to come here . I know that now when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for several minutes , his eyes on the lovely , tropical landscape below him , but he was n't seeing it . He was trying to find a chink in Naylor 's defensive armor . " It 's a funny thing about this murder . I saw Banks alive close on three . And the police doctor says he was dead by three-thirty at the latest . He says in heat like this and all it 's hard to tell the time exactly . So that does n't give much leeway for the man who shot him . If you talked to him at  --  say , three-fifteen  --  and then left  --  say at three-thirty  --  why the murderer must have come in as you left . " " Now you should ask whether I saw him , " Naylor said bitterly . " I was wondering . " " Well , I did n't . " Naylor rapped out the denial and for an96 Murder Makes Us Gayinstant was on the verge of saying more , but on second thought clamped his mouth shut as if Denny would take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Denny 's knee a conciliatory pat . " I know you mean well but I do n't think you or anybody else can help me . I  --  do n't trust anyone  --  not even you  --  not enough to tell them what I think . At least  --  not yet . " Denny jabbed his cigarette against the ash tray . " That 's O.K. by me . I do n't blame you . However , if you get to the point where you have to talk or bust or go on a drunk  --  come to me and talk . It ' 11 be a lot safer . Meanwhile I 'll gather up what I can in the way of clues . Not that I 'll be able to do much . Ray is really the fellow for that . " Whatever Naylor would have replied , Denny was not to know for just in that instant there was a knock . Naylor straightened and stretched out a hand to pull the cord of the table lamp . As the light sprang on the brilliance of the night was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window facing a barren room . Denny could see now how pale and tired Naylor looked , and how tense he was . " Maybe it 's McLaughlin again , " Naylor said with a thin smile as the knocking was repeated . Instead of bidding the person to enter , Naylor strode to the door and flung it open . Denny could not see who stood there , but Naylor 's exclamation brought him to his feet . " My God ! Laura ! " The agony in his voice made Denny flinch . " You should n't have come here . " Naylor pulled her into the room and hastily closed the door . Laura stood , tall and slender , silhouetted in black against the cream-colored walls . " Will , I had to see you , " she said , her breath catching and making it difficult for her to talk . Naylor had taken both her hands in his . Denny was acutely uncomfortable and wondered whether he should cough or whistle or just beat it from the room . While he was still vacillatMurderMakes Us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulder . She snatched her hands away and withdrew toward a corner of the room . A painful smile twisted her lips . " I  --  I came here because I thought this was one place I could see you alone and even here  --  even here " Shestopped and bit her lip . " I 'm sorry , " Denny muttered awkwardly . " I 'd have gone if I 'd known you were coming . I was here because I wanted to help him . " Laura made a pitiful gesture of resignation . " I do n't blame you  --  only it 's so terrible never having a minute 's freedom or  --  or peace to think things out . Everywhere you turn there 's a policeman , watching  --  searching " She shuddered . Denny looked at Naylor and then quickly shifted his gaze because of what he read in the latter 's face . For that one selfforgottenmoment Naylor 's defenses were down , and his feelingswere bared for anyone to see . A horror crept through Denny at the thought of what Naylor must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divorced him to marry HaroldBanks . After all , if he had been a free man he could have have put up some sort of a fight but locked in jail he could do nothing but submit . Naylor stood there , stiffly erect like a wooden soldier , his hands clenched by his sides and his eyes dark and smoldering . Laura became calmer , as though she felt the need of composureto combat Naylor 's passion . " I came about Billie . Are you sure he 's all right ? " " Quite sure . " " Is this Ames man  --  I mean will he be kind and protect Billie from the worst of  --  this horrible thing ? " " That 's why I took him there . Because Ames will understand . Besides , there are boys of his age who will keep him interested and amused . " " Oh , I 'm glad . I 've worried so . " 98 Murder Makes Us GayShe sat down suddenly and putting her hand to the high neck of her black dress , pulled at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You need n't worry about Billie . He 's in good care . " Naylor spoke in a cold , formal way that was in utter contrast to the expression in his eyes . " If you care to you can visit him . WilburAmes knows all about us . He 'll be much too tactful to ask questions . " An ironical smile twitched Naylor 's lips , and it seemed to make Laura uneasy . She looked down at her hands and then involuntarily covered the left finger where Banks 's magnificent rings still sparkled . " I 'm not criticizing you for taking Billie away from here . I think you were very sensible . If  --  if  --  I had had so much presence of mind I would have done the same thing . I was just thoughtless . " " You did n't have as much reason as I had . " " This hotel life was n't the right surroundings for him anyway , " Laura said fretfully . " I kept thinking it but I never did anything about it . I 'm an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reply , so Laura 's remark went unchallenged . Denny decided it was high time for him to go and took the first step toward the door , but Naylor 's hand shot out . " Do n't go ! I would n't want the wrong interpretation put upon Mrs Banks ' visit to me . It is just as well you are witness to what goes on here . Otherwise , Mr McLaughlin would have a still stronger motive for my killing Harold Banks , would n't he , Laura ? " " Do n't talk that way , Will . It  --  it is n't right . Oh , Denny , if you only could help us ! They all think Will shot Harold , but I know he did n't . " " How do you know it ? " Naylor asked with a peculiar smile , his voice harsh . " I just know it , " she said helplessly . " You  --  could n't do a thing like that . " Murder Makes Us Gay 99 " I killed your uncle Joshua , do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not yet twenty getting smashed to pulp . " " No ! Those were accidents . You could n't help them . They  --  they might happen to anyone who is unlucky . Do n't be so bitter , Will . You never were like this . You ca n't have changed so much . " Naylor abruptly turned his back on her pleading . He went to the window and stared down into the garden . Laura slumped in her chair . Her black dress was so incongruous in that room designed for heat and pastels or white that it made her seem a stranger  --  someone who had just happened in and did not belong there . Death , tragedy , mourning were all taboo in that land of sun and sea and sand . One could only look upon them in the way the guests did  --  not as reality but as a game , a pastime , a puzzle with which to beguile the long , lazy hours . " He was buried today , " Laura said softly , as though she were following Denny 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ messages , but few people came . Mostly reporters and people who were curious . It 's  --  odd , but he had n't many friends . Here in the hotel nobody seems to care that he 's gone . Except perhaps Tina and  --  well , one never knows with Tina just what she is thinking . Perhaps that is good breeding . " She pushed back her heavy , blond hair and pressed her hands to her forehead . Her eyes sought the motionless figure of Naylor while she asked Denny : " Do you think it will take much longer ? This Mr McLaughlin  --  is he very clever ? One ca n't tell ; he is so huge and so quiet  --  except his eyes . They are like lenses that catch everything you do . I noticed that he scarcely ever blinks . He just looks and looks until I feel like screaming . Perhaps in another day or two I shall . " She smiled wanly as with an effort she dragged her eyes from Naylor and looked up at Denny . He thought she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , always gentle and sweet tempered , simple candor making her blue eyes large and direct . But Denny was never sure that this was all there was to her . He sometimes had a notion she was half asleep because her fulllippedmouth with its sensuous curves certainly contradicted the coolness of her gaze . " Maybe if you and Naylor would tell the police all you know they might be able to solve the murder , " Denny said a trifle impatiently . Laura resented his remark . She flung up her chin and asked : " What makes you think we have n't told all we know ? " Denny shrugged . He was getting fed up with both of themand decided for a second time to leave . " Suit yourself about talking . In any case , you are n't obliged to talk to me . I 've got no position and not much experience to mention , but if you are innocent you better get busy to prove it . Do n't rely on the infallibility of the law . I admit the wrong men do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once in a while . So " Before Laura could voice her protests against this horrible threat or Naylor could offer any reply Ray barged into the room . His knock was so brief and his appearance so abrupt that he seemed to have materialized out of thin air . And he could very well have impersonated some evil genie . His black eyes were blazing and his mouth a thin line . " Hello , Denny , " he said shortly . " I might have known you 'd be here . " Denny had been gawking and now collected his wits sufficiently to ask the pertinent question . " What 's the matter with you ? " " Plenty . And not with me alone . " His eyes swept over the quaking Laura and came to rest on Naylor . For a moment he studied the latter , as though trying in his face to find the answer to a riddle . Murder Makes Us Gay i o i " Mr Naylor , McLaughlin wants to see you , " he said at last . " Again ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told him all I can and " This is about something else . " " Oh , dear God , what now ? " Laura gasped . Ray 's eyes never left Naylor 's face . " One set of fingerprintsfrom the roulette room match yours perfectly . They were found on the table under which Banks was lying . Both croupiers and Reynolds will swear to the fact that you were not in the game room Saturday night . McLaughlin wants to hear your story about the prints . " Ray spoke in a deliberate , measured way . Denny , watching him , wondered just what was his purpose . It would almost seem that he was giving Naylor time to form an explanation . Naylor , however , showed no agitation . His eyes never wavered from Ray 's direct gaze . " The croupiers and Reynolds must be mistaken . I was in the game room . " " It 's three against one , and they are all reliable men , trained to have sharp eyes . You 'll have to think up a better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my story , and I stick to it . " " These prints were found on the leg of the table . What were you doing with the leg while you were gambling ? " " Perhaps I was touching wood for luck . " At Naylor 's answer the vitality drained from Ray 's face , which assumed a curiously blank expression . " All right . You can tell that to McLaughlin . He has already said you would offer some such alibi . " Ray gestured toward the door . " Come on . " Naylor followed him without a word or glance at either Laura or Denny . " The damned pigheaded fool ! " Denny swore . " Ca n't he see1 02 Murder Makes Us Gaythe hell of a fix he 's in ? He wo n't get anywhere by bucking the police . He 's behaving in the only way he could if he had shot Banks . By God , I 'm beginning to believe he did do it . " " No , oh no , you must n't , " Laura @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook it hysterically . " You  --  I -- we 've got to stick by him . Somebody has to . These  --  these things go so quickly . Like last time . It was just a few weeks and then it was over , and he was gone . It must n't happen a second time . Please do n't let it . " Then to Denny 's amazement and disconcertion , the selfcontainedLaura began to weep . Not hysterically , but in a soft , heart-rending way . " Everything 's been so dreadful and so wrong for years and years , " she said , still crying and pulling at the lace of her handkerchief while the tears ran down her cheeks unchecked . " Will and I  --  something was always coming between us  --  Mother and money . I used to think if I had lots and lots of money life would be wonderful , and it 's only gotten worse . If only Will had n't come here . He should n't have . The minute I heard he 'd come I knew there would be trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sadly and irrelevantly . Now she put her handkerchief to good use while Denny still stood tongue-tied . When she had dried her face she gazed up at Denny shyly . " I 'm such a fool . You look horrified . " A faint smile blotted out some of the strain in her face . " I do n't do this often . It must be that terrible McLaughlin man . He exasperates me till I feel like exploding . " Denny gave her a cigarette and waited for her to calm down a little before he said : " If you want to keep him out of jail you 'd better help me find another candidate for the murderer . I do n't know myself why I believe he 's innocent , because it certainly is a swell case against him . " Murder Makes Us Gay 103Denny paced up and down the room trying to lay his hand on the elusive reason upon which he based his opinion . Some- where in the depths of his mind , under layers of popular songs and semiclassic lyrics , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had groped about his memory like a blind man trying to find an object whose familiar feeling would help him to get his bearings , but so far his search had been fruitless . " The case is n't all circumstantial evidence either . He had more than enough motive . It will be hard to convince a jury that he did n't do it . His best chance would be to plead tem- porary insanity . He might get away with a long sentence then . Perhaps life . " " Oh no , " Laura said aghast . " Not again . Why , he 'll have spent his whole life in prison . He will go insane then . Ca n't you see what it 's done to him , those years in jail ? Do n't you remember how  --  he was before ? " Denny remembered all too well . In spite of the shock , the horror and shame of that other trial , Will Naylor had been a fine specimen with a slightly aggressive air of freedom and pride . His passion for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alertness to his whole body so that Denny , seeing him in court , could n't believe that such a man was to be confined to the limitations of prison walls . Yes , Denny remembered him very well , considering their brief acquaintance . How much more clearly must Laura remember the man to whom she had been married eight years and who was the father of the sturdy little Billie . " He 's changed a lot , " Denny said abruptly , coming to stop in front of Laura . " He 's fine-drawn and he has n't much faith left  --  but I do n't believe he 'd shoot a man either in temper or cold blood . " Laura averted her eyes and began to tease her handkerchief again. 1 04 Murder Makes Us Gay " Of course I do n't either . But the others do , and that is what must decide our actions . " Denny now sensed something evasive in her manner . Two minutes ago she had been all candor . He hastily reviewed what he had said . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took another turn about the room and then remarked : " This whole thing must be a dreadful blow to your mother . She was very fond of your husband , was n't she ? " " Oh yes . She always preferred Harold to Will , " Laura replied , showing no surprise at the abrupt change of conversation . " Still , I suppose she 's one of those people who can always find consolations . " Laura smiled ruefully . " Yes , I 'm afraid she is . I 've told her I did n't think it was nice for her to dance tonight , but she seems to think if she wears a black dress that makes it all right . " " Is she afraid of Mr borne being fickle ? " Denny asked with a grin that took the edge off the question . Laura lifted one shoulder in an expressive gesture . " What can one say to the business ? Poor Mother is frantic to be young . Nothing makes her so insane as the thought of having to look her age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she simply has to get out among them . Really , I do n't know where she gets the energy or patience . The things she endures at the hands of Hedda seem to me almost as bad as medieval torture , but she suffers through it all . " Again Laura shrugged . " I 'd never do it . Sometimes I think our places are mixed . She is I , and I am she . I think I 'll enjoy a nice peaceful old age . Some of the old people who come here , so sedate , so dignified , and yet they look so comfortable . There have been times when I envied them . Is n't it silly ? " " Certainly , it 's silly . It 's not only silly but bad . You 're a quitter . It 's a good thing for the progress of the world thatMurder Makes Us Gay 105not all young people have your lukewarm attitude .

And Jerry and Tina do it . And Will used to with Uncle Joshua . He said he was just teasing him , but it was bickering all the same . And I hate it . I 've always hated it  --  since I was a small child . My father was sweet and patient , and Mother fussed him every minute that he was home . I think he was almost glad to die . I can understand that . I 've felt that way sometimes  --  only I have Billie , and he makes things better . If it were n't for him I 'd give them all the money they are everlastinglyscrapping about and go away where it 's peaceful . " Laura was flushed , and her eyes were blazing with a queer passion . For once Denny had to admit she was living up to the promise of her mouth . But even as he admitted this the fire that had transformed her died down , leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry . I did n't mean to shout like this . Today has been so dreadful . I think I 'd better retire to bed . And is n't it about time for you to go on ? " She was pleasant but aloof , entirely the wife of the manager , and Denny , as an employee , was well aware of it . But he was not going to allow her to push him around . " We have gone pretty far afield . I do n't know just how it happened but we were discussing " " Let 's not any more now . Tomorrow perhaps . " She rose and proceeded determinedly on her way , and Denny could not follow her . He had to change to formal dress . On his way to his room Denny meditated on what he had witnessed . All in all , he had spent a curious two hours , the outcome of which was an intense feeling of depression . No matter how much he might want to deny it , he knew thatI o6 Murder Makes Us GayNaylor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , too , and it had been a grim disappointment . Denny felt he was in part to blame for Ray 's attitude because he had always championed Will Naylor . Why ? That was the riddle . Why did he always take up cudgels for a fellow who had been instrumental in the death of a harmless old man ? Ordinarily he was not the least sentimental or altruistic . Obviously Will Naylor had some connection with Banks 's death . Yet how could a man take part in a murder and not be guilty ? Denny heaved a gusty sigh which nearly blew his crisp white jacket from its hanger . " Oh , to hell with it , " he thought morosely and began to shed his clothes preparatory to taking a shower . IXAFTER THE CALAMITY OF THE FINGERPRINTS DENNYexpected the worst to happen . But still McLaughlin did not arrest Naylor . Ray was uncommunicative , and not even Lou 's wiles could make him more sociable . The Crystal Court had been sweltering in spite of the sea breezes and electric fans , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regular guests had moved northward as per schedule there were more than enough new ones to replace them . The reporters , finding little in regard to the murder to write about , turned to these new and dashing guests to supply the sensational news which is why the guests came , why they looked so ravishing or handsome according to sex and why they behaved so merrily . Denny , facing that crowd of vivacious , overstimulated people , thought cynically that this was one murder which supplied gaiety . He could see Leon Paine , standing discreetly in the shadows , his eyes glittering while he mentally rubbed his hands . Wherever Paine was , there was Chesty lurking at his elbow . But poor Chesty didn'tto8 Murder Makes Us Gaylook too happy . Mr Paine had donned the late Banks 's shoes , and they fitted him much too well to please the ambitious assistant manager . The excellent music , the heavy fragrance from the lush gardens , the drifting shadows cast by the gently breeze-swung lamps distilled just enough intoxicating essence in the air to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Above this brilliant , flowery panorama there loomed the terrible mountain of McLaughin . Denny had seen him only at a distance . It was as close as he cared to see him , though , if Ray 's tight-lipped oppression and Naylor 's exhaustion were an indication of his influence . McLaughlin , working hand in glove with Paine , was keeping the investigation so quiet that it in no wise disturbed the magnificent routine of the hotel , except to add a flavor of piquancy to the normally sweet existence in the Alhambra . Denny , sauntering along the boardwalk in front of the Cabana Club the next morning , noticed that the usually animated corner where Tina held court was strangely empty . Later he saw her sitting alone , far out on the jagged coral rocks . For one who was always the center of every important event , this isolation was preposterous . Denny would have gone out to investigate if Jerry Morrison had not had the same idea in the same moment . About a quarter of a mile further on he passed Naylor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasantly shaded by three slanting palms , and Denny himself had introduced Naylor to the virtues of the spot . If it had n't been so hot Denny would have gone to Naylor . Besides , the latter looked as dejected as Princess Tina , and Denny had no stomach for more dejection . After a swim maybe he would be able to dispense a few platitudes . Right now he beach Black Jo , the dispenser of towels and suits , split his face in a grin and informed him in a lovable singsong that " Mr Ray and Miss Lou done gone an ' swum out to the raft . I'se to tell you all to wait heah fo ' dem . " Denny morosely went through the performance of cooling off , and after twenty minutes of lazy swimming he abandoned the water for the shade of the bathhouse . He lit a cigarette and stretched out on his back and stared up into the cerulean vault above him . Dolce far niente , Denny thought in a melancholy mood . Why the devil did Banks have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? He must have done something to invite murder , Denny reasoned ; otherwise he would n't have been killed . Denny was a firm believer in the laws of retribution . It was a satisfying credo to know that somewhere along life 's road old scores were settled , and justice dealt out . So if Banks was killed he had harmed someone too . Come to think of it , he had antagonized several people : Naylor , poor Polly and Monte , perhaps Tina with her lack of money and Jerry with his fondness for gambling and Tina , possibly Laura and Chesty . Still , none of them had half so good a score to settle as Naylor . The least Banks could have done was to give Naylor a chance with his own son  --  but to sick that damned Paine on to him was a really dirty trick . Thus far Denny reflected ; then he sat up and squinted at the raft . The two little figures , which represented Lou and Ray , were still lying side by side on the seesawing logs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Funny , he thought , his mind jumping back seven years . Supposing Naylor had been killed along with old Leighton ? Queer , this escape of Naylor . That 's what had bothered Denny about the case in those days , but Brabant had only pish-tushed his worries and claimed there were hundreds of t o Murder Makes Us Gayfreak accidents where several people were killed , and one miraculously escaped . When he had finished pish-tushing he had nailed Denny with a stark eye and cautioned him to remember , for the sake of their client , that if his escape was n't a miracle the only other supposition was that old Leighton 's death was murder . Denny could n't follow Brabant 's reasoning and therefore was awed into silence . Heaven forbid that he should bring a murder charge down on their unfortunate but attractive client 's head . He kept his inexperienced notions to himself after that although he went right on having notions . Things had always looked black for Naylor . Like now  --  he would be lucky if he could get off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ melancholy reflections Ray and Lou returned from the raft and flopped down beside him . Both were out of breath but in excellent spirits . " Hello , darling , " Lou said , shaking the wetness from her hair , most of the water landing on him . " Is n't it heavenly ? " " What , specifically ? " " Oh , everything . " She gestured widely . " All around here . " " Have you forgotten Naylor ? And Banks ? And the murder ? " Lou distorted her pretty red lips . " No . But I made Ray promise not to talk about it , and he did n't . " " What 's the use ? " Ray asked resignedly . " McLaughlin knows all there is no know . He has cross-examined every person and thing that has come in contact with Banks in the last five years -- and there 's not a single prospect or even a lead except Naylor . The chief says you 've got to have something to start from , even if it 's only a canary seed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's being very prudent about Naylor . Does n't want to rush things . That 's McLaughlin . Take your time and be sure you are right . He 's going to have a heart-tohearttalk with Devlin Seabury , Banks ' lawyer , today . And ifMurder Makes Us Gay IIInothing comes from that " Ray completed the sentencewith a shrug . " Do you take part in the session with the lawyer ? " Denny asked casually , poking holes in the sand . Ray smiled . " Oh sure . McLaughlin likes to have somebody to check his memory . " " Would you say Banks was disturbed at Tina 's party ? I mean , did he seem to have something on his mind ? " Lou wanted to know . " Nothing but the princess , " Denny replied curtly , without for the moment realizing the significance of his remark . " What do you mean by that ? " Ray asked . " Oh , I do n't know . Why heckle me ? " " But you said it as though it meant something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be something in the back of your mind you do n't know about . " " It 's just as well I do n't , " Denny grumbled , annoyed at the way they scrutinized him . It was a perfectly obvious remark . Why should he have to explain it ? " Come on , Denny , do n't be a bear . What did you mean ? " Denny sat up with a sigh . " I tell you I do n't know . When Tina 's around everybody has her on his mind  --  his or her mind , for that matter . You know it as well as I do . " He stared across the gleaming blue waters , narrowing his eyes against the glare of the sun . He tried to recall that evening and the atmosphere that had been in the room . Now as he pictured the scene he remembered there had been a flat taste to the party . Tina herself had not been up to par . And Banks had sat like a heavy-eyed dummy , making perfunctory answers until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party 's breakup . " Lou , " he asked suddenly , " would you say Banks had a lot of appeal ? " II2 Murder Makes Us GayLou 's eyes sparkled mischievously . " Oh , you want the woman 's viewpoint ? Well , for myself I 'd say no but I can see he 's got certain attractions . If he were a little taller he 'd have been a fine example of manhood . Even so , there was nothing wrong with his face . Eleanor was always smitten . It seems , according to her , his mouth was ruthless , and his cold eyes had a particular effect on certain women . In Eleanor 's case it was pretty devastating . Whenever he happened to come into our office Eleanor was completely demoralized . Does that answer your question ? " " I ca n't see any similarity between Eleanor and the princess if that 's what you 're getting at , " Ray said dryly . " The princess has the benefit of expert training ; remember the Colonel 's lady and Judy O'Grady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Of course . He 'd have questioned the mice if there ' d been any around . I was there myself , and the results were nil . " " How did she behave ? " " Well , she was very much the grand duchess , and poor McLaughlin was impressed , in spite of democratic intentions . I do n't blame him . As you say , she 's really got something and when she 's cast for tragedy she 's got Garbo beat by a mile . " " Do you think she was putting on the tragedy ? " Denny asked curiously . Ray shrugged . " Do n't expect me to know what a woman like that would do ; but if you want my opinion for what it 's worth I 'd say she really was cut up about Banks . " " Was she frank ? " " Frank ? " Ray repeated the word scornfully . " None of those people are frank . Not even Polly , who jabbers incessantly . My God , can that woman talk ! And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think she suffers from the delusion that continual screamingchatter denotes vitality , and vitality is synonymous with youth . " Murder Makes Us Gay 113 " Poor Polly , " Lou said pityingly . " She certainly is a twentieth-centuryPonce de Leon . " " So the princess was n't frank , eh ? " Denny asked pensively . " Not so you could notice it . But maybe she really does n't know anything . Of course , since she 's an intelligent woman she 's made some guesses as to who would shoot Banks , and maybe it 's just these she 's keeping to herself . McLaughlin is very curious about her , especially what means of support she has , but he ca n't ask questions because she tells him everything before he has a chance to . In that way she covers a lot of ground without having to answer any awkward questions . " " Well , who does support her ? " Lou asked . " Her jewels and nice friends . " " Hm . There are possibilities in a reply like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Banks was helping her to live like a princess she naturally would n't kill him . Ca n't you dig up any suspect besides Naylor ? " " Not so far . " Ray was grim . Denny reluctantly heaved himself to his feet . " Well , there 's no use sitting here and talking words without getting anywhere . I 've got to mosey back to work . Coming ? " Both of them said yes and halfheartedly started the trek back to the hotel . Black Jo , who had been listening to their conversation at the window overhead , informed them when they handed in their towels : " I done heard all you folks said and I don ' never believe any father o ' that boy , Billie , killed a man . It jus ' ai n't natcheral , that 's what . " Lou , nimbly taking two steps for her companions ' one , said , " He hit the nail on the head . I 've been trying to say just that for nearly a week now . " " Such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angel . Ray ca n't save Naylor because he helped put Billie into the world . " I 14 Murder Makes Us Gay " All the same , things like that ought to count , " Lou insisted . Then spying a couple ahead of them , she exclaimed , " Look ! Whatever is she doing way down here ? " Denny , having seen Tina on the way over , was the least surprised . He had been looking for the solitary Naylor , but the rocks under the three palms were vacant . They approached Jerry and the princess who were vainly trying to open a cocoanut . In the shade of her broadbrimmed hat Tina looked pale and lovelier than ever . There was an expression in her large , soft eyes which made even Denny respond , and he had ceased to respond to anything female other than Lou since she stepped into his life . Tragedy seemed to have a sobering and salubrious effect upon Jerry Morrison . As he continued to saw on the cocoanut with his penknife he looked a lot less seedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in a great sweat over his labors . Tina smiled as she watched him . " Poor Jerry is determined to get the thing open because I happened to say I wanted a piece . The age of chivalry is not dead , it seems . " Jerry , flushed and apparently irritated by their combined regard , said peevishly : " These things are devilishly hard . I do n't see how the darkies get them open . " " They have the right kind of a knife , " Ray remarked , taking the cocoanut from him . " Here let me show you . It ca n't be done with a pretty little knife like that . Be back in a minute . " He ran across the street to his house and in a while reappearedwith a long-bladed knife . With this he proceeded to open and cut the cocoanut . Having much practice , he did it well and quickly . The princess was all admiration , and so was Jerry , although he added : " Well , of course you ought to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Murder Makes Us Gay 115Tina laughed . " Jerry , what a remark ! Are you jealous again ? " Jerry was too red to get any redder , but he looked distinctly uncomfortable . He shoved his hands into his pockets and moodily refused to eat any of the cocoanut meat Ray was pass- ing around . " I 'd have liked to drink the milk , " Tina said as they started to walk again to the hotel . " Too bad you spilled it all . " " Do n't mind Tina , " Jerry growled . " She always wants something different from what she 's got . " " I do not , " Tina pouted , nibbling on the hard , white nut meat . " I just want something in addition to what I have . There 's a difference . " Lou dropped behind a little , and now Denny joined her . They followed silently while the princess talked to the mono- syllabic Ray and the moody Jerry . " Do you know that your colleague , the estimable Mr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she asked finally when several topics had been touched upon and discarded . " I was told he had some business more pressing than this terrible tragedy to attend to . It is difficult to believe . Do you know what it is ? " No one could accuse a beautiful woman with such gracious manners and such a low , caressing voice of doing anything so vulgar as fishing for information . Still , one could n't deny , the princess was very , very curious . Ray replied blandly , " I have n't the slightest idea . Sorry . " " Not that it makes any difference to me . I 'm glad when that X-ray-eyed policeman is n't anywhere near me . I 'm afraid he may persuade me to confess I 've had my face lifted or that my hair is false . " " Has he found out anything at all ? " Jerry asked , leaning forward to peer at Ray . " It does n't seem possible that allt i 6 Murder Makes Us Gaythose chaps can be figuring around on it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more unsolved murder cases than you 'd believe , " Ray said . " There has been very little evidence of any sort , and what there is points to Naylor , as everyone in the hotel appears to know , thanks to the reporters . " " Do n't you think he did it ? " Tina asked , tossing away the remains of her piece of cocoanut . " What I think is of no importance . What matters is the evidence , such as it is . " " Can they make a good case of it ? " Ray shrugged in reply to Jerry 's question . He was so brusk about it that both the princess and Jerry lapsed into silence until they reached the shallow , broad steps which led up to the entrance . The princess stopped to gaze up at the blinding white hotel . " Every time I look upon this place it delights me anew . It is such a fantastic copy of its namesake . You know , it really is n't a bit like the real Alhambra . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , it is a wonderful little copy of some architect 's dream of that place in Granada . It always reminds me of the splendid palace Ala-ed-Din bade the slave of the lamp erect in front of the Sultan 's serai for his lovely lady Bedr-el-Budur . Perhaps some day the Moorish sorcerer will come riding on one of those terrible hurricane winds and blow the whole pretty thing into the sea . He really should have come the night Harold Banks was shot . " The dark eyes of the princess sped over the astonished faces of her companions , and then she burst out laughing . " Oh , you all look so droll . Do n't you like my fancies ? They are quaint , are n't they ? And you Americans are so practical . You ca n't believe even for a moment in jinn and magic palaces . " She was still laughing as she ran up the stairs with a careless wave of her hand . Jerry followed more slowly while RayMurder Makes Us Gay 117and Denny and Lou stood staring after them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dumb but I have a hunch that whimsy was supposed to mean something . " " Let 's get a copy of The Arabian Nights and study up on Ala-ed-Din ; maybe that will give us the answer , " Denny suggested . Ray , however , had no interest in their remarks . Rather abruptly he said , " See you later , " and marched up the stairs . " Curiouser and curiouser , " Lou murmured . " You and me seem to be out in the cold . " " I 'd rather be out in the cold with you than in heaven with anybody else , " Denny declared fervently . Lou chuckled . " That 's what I love about you , Denny . You always come through with the tag line . Now I 'll go eat . I 'm famished . " Denny sought out the rear of the exquisitely cool Alhambresquebar over which the merry Max presided . The musicians and hotel staff were not permitted to lounge about on the embossed leather chairs and benches of the bar proper , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his aids concocted the hundreds of drinks consumed on the other side of the wall . Max was plump and dimpled and never allowed anything to disturb his equanimity . In the present circumstances Max was worth his weight in gold . Paine was the first to realize this and had promptly told Max he admired his way of carrying on . Max blinked a little . Not being able to act other than he always did , this praise was a little incomprehensible . " It would be different , " Max told Denny , " if Banks was anything to me . But he was only a boss , and the world is full of bosses . " On this day , when Denny wanted to sneak a drink before118 Murder Makes Us Gaylunch , Max was in his customary cheerful frame of mind and all set for the twelve-to-one rush . He gladly gave Denny his drink and then , spreading his hands along the edge of the back counter , remarked , " Well ? What 's new ? " " Nothing . I come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going back to the mainland before he 's got the case solved ? " " Well , I guess he thinks it 's solved . He took the gun over for a ballistics report or whatever you call it . " " Gun ? What gun ? " Denny asked , very nearly dropping his glass . Max beamed . " Have n't you heard ? " " No . For God 's sake tell me . " " Do n't get so excited , " Max cautioned him , still beaming . " I 'll tell you . Nolan found a gun , and it 's the same size as the bullet they dug out of Banks . Nolan is ' bout ready to bust with pride . " " Probably McLaughlin fell around his neck . " " I should n't wonder . Nolan looked like somebody handed him the Medal of Honor . " " When did he find it ? The whole crew has been searching for the gun for days . Who had it ? " " Nobody had it . Nolan found it on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me of it because one of McLaughlin 's buddies came in and collared him . Told him to keep his mouth shut . Nolan was sore as hell , but he 's scared to death of McLaughlin . I mean , he wants to impress the big fellow . " " Do they know whose gun it is ? " " If they do nobody told me , " Max replied cheerfully . " Probably turn out to be Naylor 's . " " Et tu , Brute ! " Denny groaned . " Cut out the French and tell me why it should n't be Naylor 's . He 's the funniest acting fellow I ever came across . Murder Makes Us Gay 119Barged in here the night of the murder and ordered a double scotch . Then all he did was look at it . Would n't drink it at all . Must have thought I was out to poison him . " " What time was that ? " " Oh , ' bout two . He was all tied up in knots and red as a lobster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practically kissed his pardon . The old coot 's as deaf as they make ' em , and so he could n't understand anything Naylor said . Now he 's sure Naylor is crazy and should be locked up . Of course he 's only going by appearances . From all I hear , Naylor is nuts about the kid  --  and probably about Mrs Banks too . " One of Max 's assistants came in , and Max promptly sent him on an errand . When he had gone he said : " Keep this under your hat , Denny . I do n't want to help the police any more ' n I have to . They are no particular friends of mine . It 's their guessing game , so let them think of the answers . They chose their jobs ; let them earn their money . I do n't go around asking people to tell me how to mix a drink . " " I still do n't believe Naylor shot Banks . It does n't make sense . " " Lots of things in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn about when you grow up , " Max remarked with a grin . " But do n't you feel sorry for a fellow who " Now wait a minute . If I 'm going to feel sorry for anybody it 's going to be myself . I do n't know anything about Naylor , but any man who makes faces at a drink I hand him is no friend of mine . " " There 's such a lot of prejudice in the world . " Denny sighed and finished his drink . " You better get out of those slacks and into your flower . Baxter 's been around already . " " All right , all right . Do n't rush me. " r2o Murder Makes Us Gay " What 's the matter , Denny ? You 're always so grumpy these days . The customers are beginning to notice your lack of the spirit of old Vienna . ' One lady , stunning , too , told me you used to have such a lovely invitation in your gray eyes when you played but now - ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment Denny regarded him in stony silence . Then he said : " I ca n't make up my mind whether to drown you or poison you . I 'd like to do both . " " Do n't blame me ; blame your fatal charm . " XAFTER LUNCH DENNY PROWLED ABOUT THE CASINO ANDthe hall leading to the Banks 's apartments . He kept hoping he would be invited to the conclave which he suspected was going on behind the closed doors . He had just about given up hope when Ray appeared in the company of a fine old gentleman who carried his embonpoint like a decoration . Denny met them with pleading eyes and his tongue practically hanging out . Ray introduced the newcomer as Devlin Seabury , the Banks 's lawyer . Seabury had shrewd , twinkling eyes and seemed to be a mind reader , for he said to Denny : " Why do n't you come along ? There 's nothing very private about a case that 's being read by millions of people . " " Denny does n't believe Mr Naylor shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prove it , " Ray statedsoberly but , Denny suspected , with his tongue in his cheek . " Well , that 's interesting , " Seabury said , equally sober . " I'veI2I122 Murder Makes Us Gaynever met Naylor , but from what the papers say he must be a ferocious chap . " They had walked on and now reached the apartment . Ray knocked and upon invitation opened the door . The room was already crowded . Laura , Polly , Korne , Jerry , Tina , Paine and Chesty were in the midst of an animated discussion . As usual , Polly was doing nine tenths of the talking . At the sight of Seabury she stopped dead . In the pause that followed Seabury was introduced , and from the ensuing conversation Denny learned that Seabury had already passed through a long session with Laura and McLaughlin . He had come here at Laura 's request because she felt that both Paine and Chesty should be informed of Banks 's financial condition . She herself was obviously too listless or oppressed to evince even the slightest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group assembled , thought the selection very significant . They were all intensely interested in the dignified Mr Seabury who was now ensconced in a comfortable chair , knees crossed and hands clasped upon his rotundity . Paine could not wait for him to speak but blurted out with his usual impatience : " Well ? Well ? What is this nonsense about Banks ' not making a will ? " His sharp little eyes stabbed at Seabury , but the latter remained unruffled except that his thick white eyebrowsrose slightly . " It may be nonsense but it is quite true . Mr Banks was a reserved , not to say secretive , man . He resented any interferencewith or advice upon his affairs . He seldom asked my counsel except in routine matters . The meagerness of his estate was as much a surprise to me as to you . " " He made plenty of money here , " Paine said resentfully , still thinking of the money he and his associates had lostMurder Makes Us Gay 123before the Banks 's era . " He was by no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " That is true , but the majority of his profits went into his personal account and from there were withdrawn again as cash . Where they went after that I do n't know . As I say , Mr Banks was an extremely reserved individual . The only part I can locate is that which he gave his wife . This was in repaymentfor large sums which he borrowed from her . He possesses no investments other than this establishment , and his cash assets amount to a little less than ten thousand dollars . " " How very strange , " Polly said indignantly . " I  --  why I ca n't believe it . Harold was a very methodical person , and not to make a will is hardly methodical . I 'd have thought ... " But she did n't voice her thought , lapsing instead into a preoccupied silence . Korne watched her without seeming to . Tina looked bored , as did Jerry . Seabury had surveyed the circle , too , and ended by saying gently : " Perhaps Mr Chester can enlighten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his vicinity , and this was no exception . His self-important expression was wrinkled by distemper . " No , " he replied curtly . " I ca n't . I was n't Mr Banks ' secretary nor his confidant . I was assistant manager and dealt with problems of this hotel . What he did in his personal life was no concern of mine . " " Was he a good manager ? " Seabury asked abruptly but still amiably . Chesty puffed up . " That is hardly a suitable question to put to me . Mr Banks was comparatively new to the hotel business , whereas I have been associated with hotels for twenty years . Needless to say , Banks did not have my practical knowledge . " 124 Murder Makes Us Gay " Still , he made the business pay ? " " Oh yes , we always have a full house , if that is what you mean . However , the quality of the hotel keeping was not due to him so much as to the excellence of his staff , all of whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotels of the country . " " We know all that , " Paine snapped , brushing aside Chesty 's valiant attempt to take a little glory unto himself and the people he had hired . " The point is to find out just how Mr Banks left his affairs . " Chesty lapsed into an offended silence . " You know he did not own this hotel . Indeed not , though I have no doubt that he hoped to in the future . It is , however , doubtful whether we would ever have allowed him to do more than hold the lease , even if he could have hoped to make enough money to buy us out . " Paine almost smacked his lips and did rub his hands . After all , Mr Banks had had the idea which had transformed the white elephant into the place where Mr High Finance , Mrs Social Register , Mr Theater , Miss Hollywood and Mr and Mrs Satellites found it not only delightful but also desirableto spend a few weeks each year and Mr Banks was reaping the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to no more than the crumbs . Now at last they could move in on the ground floor of the enterpriseinstead of looking in hungrily at the windows . These reflections stirred in the back of Denny 's mind as he watched the glittering eyes of Mr Paine . Seabury examined his nails while Paine rushed on , spitting out jerky sentences that had little to do with the present . Eventually he paused , and then Seabury said : " Mr McLaughlin was disappointed that there was no will and also that Mr Banks ' affairs offered so little material forerinvestigation , shall we say ? Except , of course , the perMurderMakes Us Gay 125sonal account . It 's very interesting . His deposits and withdrawalsshow that while he made a great deal of money his expenditures must have pretty well balanced his income . Mrs Banks , could you offer any suggestion ? " Seabury enhanced his question with a gentle smile , but Laura did not respond . On the contrary , she seemed irked by it . " I have told Mr McLaughlin several times that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not at all a businesswoman , and business details always bore me . When we were first married and he asked me for money I naturally gave it to him . Later he insisted on me having my own account but he took care of it for me . I do n't see what concern it is of the police how he spent his money as long as he does n't owe money to anybody . " Seabury was not disturbed by Laura 's vehemence . He sat complacent as before , waiting for her to stop . When she did he said : " It is a matter of interest  --  because cash checks are a good way of paying for blackmail . There would be no names to trace . " " Blackmail ! " Polly screamed . " Why , that 's ridiculous . Who would blackmail Harold ? Besides , in order to be blackmailed one has to have done something disgraceful , and I know Harold did n't . I know it positively . Why , I 've lived with him every day for years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't believe a word of it . You are just trying to defame his character . To  --  to excuse that impossible Will Naylor . Well , I wo n't have it . I wo n't sit here and let you talk that way about Harold . Laura , why do n't you say something ? He was your husband , a good husband , too , and you " Oh , Mother , please stop , " Laura ordered , interrupting her mother 's strident tirade much more rudely than was her custom . " I wo n't stop , " Polly snapped , gesticulating violently . " This126 Murder Makes Us Gayhas been going on long enough . It 's time somebody spoke his mind and cleared up this mess . I admit that it 's too bad Will is Billie 's father , but that ca n't be helped . You can say he was crazy , that he did n't know what he was doing . Goodnessknows , if he was in his sane wits I do n't see how he could come here , here of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But that does n't pull the wool over anybody 's eyes . He just brooded and brooded in jail and was determined the first minute he got out to come here and spoil everything for us . And he has certainly succeeded . Poor Harold is gone , and that means we ca n't have the hotel any more , and everything  --  everything is spoiled . I hope they do kill him . He deserves " Mother , if you do n't stop this ridiculous behavior I 'm going to leave . " Laura had risen and was towering over the hysterical Polly . For an instant it looked as if she would slap her , but then she turned away and went to the window . Jerry rose to help himself to a cigarette from the box on the table . While lighting it , he remarked : " I do n't think any of this is getting us anywhere . We talk and talk about what we know nothing . There are plenty of explanations for his cash checks . There 's the casino for instance . And as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't leave any debts . We all admit McLaughlin is a competentchap , is n't he ? " Jerry addressed Ray , who had been as silent as Denny during the scene . " Of course , " Ray replied . " He would n't be where he is if he were n't competent . But since he 's human he could make a mistake . " " He has n't arrested Naylor yet , so perhaps he does n't believe him guilty . In any case , he 's more competent to handle the investigation than we are . We were all intimates of Harold , as Polly says , and none of us ever saw or heard him do a thingMurder Makes Us Gay 127for which he could be blackmailed . On the contrary , he always was inclined to be a dud . " " You should n't talk of him like that , " Tina admonished him . " I 'm only trying to show Mr Seabury how foolish the blackmail idea is . You ca n't blackmail a man who has lived a blameless existence . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Under his white brows his eyes regarded the company alertly . " I quite agree that our talk is futile . I did not approve even of this session . Except that you are connected with him in some way , I suppose , and therefore entitled to be informed of his affairs . I came here expressly upon Mrs Banks ' request and now  --  unless you have some other questions to ask me  --  I will go . I plan to return to the mainland tonight . " " Well , of course , I have several matters of great importance to discuss and " I think it would be better to settle such questions as you have through the routine business channels , " Seabury interruptedPaine 's impetuous speech . He rose , bowed slightly and proceeded majestically toward the door which Denny opened for him . He thanked Denny with a courtly dignity and strode off down the hall . Paine was angry , especially since Chesty 's lips were curled in obvious derision . The two certainly had no fondness for each other ; but then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seabury 's departure the conversation in the room was desultory . Denny speculated as to whether the news had spread about Nolan 's find . No mention was made of the gun , and Ray 's face gave no hint to such an important discovery . He just sat inconspicuously in the corner , smoking and silent . Denny wondered whether he was waiting for someone to utter an interesting remark . Paine was the first to take an abrupt leave . Chesty followed128 Murder Makes Us Gayclose on his heels , as though he did not trust the hated man out of his sight . Denny tried to catch Ray 's eye , but he seemed lost in contemplation of the fine rug at his feet . Korne and Jerry had embarked on an argument concerning the comparative merits of two methods of deep-sea fishing while Polly moped in the corner of the davenport . The princess , like Ray , was absorbed in an abstracted study of the rug . In such a scene it was no wonder the ringing of the telephone was almost as shattering as an exploding bomb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He picked up the instrumentbefore Polly , who was sitting beside it , could do so . Ray said , " Yes ? Speaking . It was ? Very well . Right . I understand . Yes . Yes . O.K. Good-by , " and put down the telephone . Denny noticed Ray 's waiting expression had changed to a grim one . He stood facing them , looking down into their curious eyes . " A report has just come through which is of great importance . Mr Banks was shot with a .38 colt , and this morning Detective Nolan found a gun on the shore , hidden in the crevices of the coral rocks . It was a clever place to hide it . Considering the number of rocks around here , the chance of finding the gun was a small one . It could n't be hidden in the hotel and it could n't be thrown into the water which might wash it up on the shore again , so it was hidden in the rocks . If it had n't been for Nolan 's perseverance and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was pushed far under the rocks by the water . We could n't very well blast away the whole shore in the hope of finding the gun . " He paused and looked from one to the other . Denny followed his gaze . Laura was listening with parted lips . Polly had her chinMurder Makes Us Gay 129thrust out and for once was silent . Korne and Jerry looked merely interested . " This gun has been examined and , as McLaughlin expected , it was the gun which fired the bullet . It is a colt .38 and is registered in the name of William Naylor . It was bought almost nine years ago . " " How can you be so sure ? " Laura asked , coming close to Ray . " How can you know ? " " The records show all that . What interests me is that Mr Naylor came here directly from the penitentiary . He did not have it with him when he left there . " " No , of course not . He got it after he came here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the gun we 've always had . Haroldtook it away from me last week and he " Mr Banks took a gun away from you ? " Ray asked sharply . " When was this ? " " I 'm telling you . Last Saturday afternoon we " And yet on Sunday when you were questioned both Mrs Banks and Mr Chester declared that Mr Banks did not own a gun . " " Well , he did n't . It was Will 's , " Polly said impatiently . " And when I asked you , you , too , said you knew of no gun . It 's very strange . " Polly began to squirm under Ray 's penetrating stare . She glanced about for aid , but the others were as withdrawn as possible . " You need n't glower at me that way , " she whimpered pettishly . " I I 'm not the only one who knew about that oldthing and I simply forgot about it . I ca n't remember every-thing . " Ray 's black eyes revealed his scorn for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mr McLaughlin will be very interested in this brand of forgetfulness . I 'll let him inquire further into it . Now I 'd like to know more about130 Murder Makes Us GaySaturday afternoon . Was Naylor here when the quarrel took place ? " " Why , yes , we all were , " Polly replied with satisfaction . " You would be , " Ray muttered through tight lips . " It was the terrible afternoon when Harold quarreled with Chesty about something , and then he was very cruel to Monte and me , and I was quite upset . I could n't bear the quarreling and all this fuss and I really wanted to kill myself and " How was it you had the gun so handy ? And loaded at that ? Especially when you could forget it so easily on other oc-casions . " " Oh , we 've had it ever since Will went to jail . Why should we throw it away ? Harold always kept it in his desk , just in case there should be burglars or something . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't loaded . " " And last Saturday in front of several people you declared you were going to kill yourself ? " Ray 's voice was heavy with sarcasm . Laura interposed quickly , " Mother is impulsive . She forgets herself when she is very excited . We had all come here to discuss the April Fool Ball , but Harold was in a bad temper because of Will , and one thing led to another and finally there was a  --  a " " A brawl , " Jerry supplied maliciously . " Quite an explosion . We all took sides , and it might have gone on indefinitely if Polly had n't begun brandishing the revolver . She scared us to death . We promptly took to cover  --  all except Banks who in his usual cold-blooded way disarmed her . It was a very diverting afternoon  --  a fitting prologue for what came later . " " I thought you said Mr Banks kept the gun in his desk . Did you go out to get it ? " " No . It was in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small console table . " Billie brought it in several days ago and asked me whether he could shoot at the sea gulls . Murder Makes Us Gay 131Of course I took it away from him . I was in a hurry and dropped it in there , thinking I 'd remind Harold later to lock it up , so Billie could n't get at it again . Firearms should n't be left where children can handle them , " Polly concluded virtuously . " And yet you left it for several days in that table . " " Well , I forgot . Besides , Billie is obedient . Since I 'd told him not to touch it he would n't . " " So you forgot about it until Saturday afternoon when you suddenly recalled it and staged an attempt at suicide . " " I wo n't have you talk to me like this , " Polly shrilled . " I 'm very sensitive and I ca n't have people sneer at me . You 're rude and insulting . " Korne forced himself to go over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You must n't excite yourself this way , darling . You 'll make yourself ill , and I 'll have no one to play with . Be a good girl and calm down . " He managed to invest his tones with a good deal of affection which had some effect on Polly but not as much as might be expected . " Mr Banks took the gun from you , and then what did he do with it ? " " I do n't know . I was too upset ; I could n't possibly notice , " Polly snapped , shaking off Korne 's caressing hands . " You 'll have to ask someone else . " " Does ailyone here know ? " " I saw him toss it on the table behind him . This big one . He was  --  well  --  wrestling with Polly , " Tina volunteered with a faint , deprecatory smile . " I must say it was a very extraordinaryscene and I 'm afraid we were all more or less startled out of our wits . Such fits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is another word . It was dreadfully hot , and Chesty was being a nuisance with his hemming and hawing . It is rather funny in retrospect  --  civilized people scream-132 Murder Makes Us Gaying at each other and fighting over guns  --  but that afternoon it was very tragic . " " Does anyone know who took the gun from the table ? " " I did , " Korne replied uneasily . " I was trying to tell you . Harold told me to put it back in his desk , and I did . The desk in his private office next door , you know . " " Did you lock the drawer ? " " No , of course not , " Korne said sharply , annoyed at Ray 's bruskness . " I did n't have a key . I just dropped it in the top drawer . " " I see . And the hall door to this private office was open ? " " Yes . It usually is . Unless Harold is talking over something very private , which is seldom . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chesty and the stenographers are . " " Was anyone else here beside you ? " Ray gestured to include all those present . " I told you ; Will was , " Polly said quickly . " And Chesty was still here , was n't he ? " " No , " Jerry asserted , " he 'd gone out when Harold started fighting with Monte and you . He is very discreet , you know . " " Or so he makes out , " Polly sniffed . " I 've caught him snoopingplenty of times . " " Do n't we all ? " Tina asked , laughing . " Really , Polly , you know you snoop just as much as he does . Do n't be so righteous . Half the fun in life is snooping into other people 's affairs . " " Then , acording to your evidence , any one of you may have used that gun Saturday night . " " Do n't be ridiculous ! " Polly exclaimed . " Why should we do that ? Will may have and probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it gave him the idea . Yes ! I 'm sure of it now . That 's what happened . He saw the gun and jumped at the chance to get rid of Harold . Oh , I see it all so clearly . Just as if I 'd been in his head . Oh , dear , I should n't have been so headless that afternoon . I 'm really responsible in a way . " Murder Makes Us Gay r 33Polly sighed deeply while the others stared at her incredulously . Ray looked thunderous , and Denny felt the way Ray looked . If the old fool jabbered this into McLaughlin 's ear he , too , would see it " all so clearly . " It was the horrible plausibility of the whole case against Naylor that gagged Denny . He could feel his own faith in Naylor 's innocence sag under the weight of accumulating evidence . " Any number of people may have known about the gun , " Laura said slowly , as though she had to force the words out . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have if she came in on an errand to Harold 's desk . It need n't be  --  just one of us . " " It is very convenient for the murderer that the gun belongs to Will Naylor . " " But look here , Captain , " Jerry protested , " do n't you think that 's a bit farfetched ? Who 'd have known it was Naylor 's gun ? I mean seeing Polly have it did n't let me know it was Will 's . I 'm sure most of us thought it was Banks ' if it was n't Polly 's . The gun did n't have a tag on it . If Will did take it he might not have known it was his . Do n't all guns look a lot alike ? " Lorne agreed excitedly with Jerry 's protest . He quite forgot about Polly who was angrily chewing her nails . Even Tina showed animation . " Yes , that 's quite true , " she said . " You ca n't possibly accuseme of knowing it was Will Naylor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just for a minute  --  do n't be angry , Polly  --  I thought it was a fake one that Polly was using to work up sympathy . " " Why , Tina , how could you ! " Polly gasped . " I said not to get angry . But really we do n't have guns as an everyday bill of fare , " Tina insisted reasonably . " And with all this talk about the April Fool Ball I thought you were just being a little premature . " 134 Murder Makes Us Gay " Why , I never heard of such a thing ! " Polly exclaimed indignantly . " How could you misunderstand me so ? " The argument between Tina and Polly might have continuedindefinitely if Ray had not suddenly decided to leave . Laura ran after him , catching hold of him in the doorway . " Oh , please , please tell me . They  --  they are n't going to arrest Will , are they ? " Ray released his arm none too gently . " It 's up to McLaugh-lin . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " What I think does n't matter . I 've told you that before , " he said shortly and turned to go . In the hall he growled , " It 's just as I thought it would be . McLaughlin knew it too . He checked up on Naylor 's trip here , and there was n't a chance that he picked up the gun en route . Would n't you know that old lady would score a bull's-eye without even thinking ? " " Does McLaughlin think Naylor got the gun here ? I thought he was all for thinking Naylor came here with the intention of killing Banks . " " No . He thinks it was unpremeditated . Done in a rage . " " It would n't be a rage if he snitched the gun from the desk and carted it to the casino . " " Oh , some rages last that long . Anyway , he was there , saw the gun and presto  --  got the idea of shooting Banks . You heard Polly . " " Yes , but he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people knew about the gun . " " Even Billie , it seems . " " My God , Ray , you do n't think the kid would do a thing like that ? " Denny was thoroughly shocked for the first time in years . " I do n't know what I think , " Ray said angrily . He led the way into the main office where Chesty was dicMurderMakes Us Gay 135tating some letters to a vivacious , gray-haired woman whose name was Etta Mason but who was nicknamed Sunny . Chesty was annoyed at the interruption and showed it . He was annoyed at a good many things these days , as the forbearingsecretary knew all too well . " All right , Mrs Mason . You can start with those . " Sunny retired to her corner and typewriter , and Ray took her chair . Denny lounged in the doorway , feeling very much the fifth wheel on the wagon . He knew from the withering glance Chesty had bestowed upon him that the assistant managerdid not approve of his presence anywhere except behind a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this gun Banks owned , " Ray began harshly without preliminaries . " The last time we asked about it nobody knew anything about guns . Now all of a sudden we learn that Mr Banks kept a gun in his unlocked desk in his private office , of which the door was also unlocked , and thereforeanyone would have access to the gun . Now what do you know about it ? " " Nothing . If I had known about it I should have told you so the first time you asked me , " Chesty stated loftily , his queer , reddish eyes glowering at Ray . " You never saw it in the desk drawer ? " " I do n't open the drawers of other people . " " Did n't you ever have a legitimate reason for using Mr Banks ' desk ? " " No . " " So you are positive you never saw or heard of this gun ? " " Yes . " " You did n't hear about the excitement over a gun last Saturday afternoon ? " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if he were afraid he might lose more words. 136 Murder Makes Us Gay " It was known to the help . " " I do n't gossip with the help . " " What was the quarrel you and Banks had ? I 've asked you before . I 'm asking you again . " " I 've told you it was a personal matter . " " That makes it important . " Chesty averted his eyes from Ray 's level gaze and sat drumminghis fingers . For several minutes the only sound was the tapping of typewriter keys punctuated by the margin bell and the slam of the carriage as Sunny shifted it . Finally Chesty leaned forward so that his unattractive face was within a few inches of Ray 's . " I 'll tell you , though it has no relation to Banks ' death . If it were n't for my guidance Banks would have made a dozen blunders a day . What did he know about the science of hotel keeping ? All he had was ideas , and most of them were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being an ambitiousman , and many times I let him do the wrong thing just to show him I was right . It 's the only way to show these big fellows sometimes how much they depend on the little ones . " Chesty 's eyes were wide open , and he stared avidly at Ray to make certain he understood . " He did n't know anything about running a hotel : how to order supplies , how to hire help , how to organize the management . I did all of that  --  down to the last towel and last bellhop . The type of people who come here expect the best , and they would n't stay if they did n't find it . They know the best , even if Banks did n't . I know the best too . In four years this hotel has acquired a reputation which other places have n't gotten in twenty years . About the only thing Banks was good at was planning advertisements . He did have a flare for that . And he looked the part of manager for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could have run the place without them . Murder Makes Us Gay 137Of course I ca n't behave the way he did  --  I 've got too much work , too many responsibilities to be suave and cool tem-pered . " " And your quarrel ? " Ray asked , being a little impatient with Chesty 's venomous recital . " I 'm coming to that , " Chesty snapped . " There were some things he did that were bad for the business but were beyond my jurisdiction , such as letting the princess live in one of the best apartments without paying a dime . If Banks had been any different than he was there would have been a stinking scandal long before this , the princess being what she is , but somehow nobody could imagine Banks having an affair with her . So scandal did n't come , but resentment did . If the princess did n't go around telling everybody she was living here free  --  and in a best apartment , mind you  --  it would n't have mattered so much , but other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ richest of them a little  --  and then have the princess pay nothing . Such favoritism is bad  --  very bad for business . The crowd that comes here is n't impressed by royalty . A lot of them have royalty married into their families , and the rest are too rich , important or famous to care about rubbing elbows with a princess  --  at least not to the extent of paying when she does n't . I 've had several veiled hints about it , and Mrs Mason has heard the same thing , not to mention the cashier who gets it often and directly from the guests . I 've never presumed to criticize either Banks or his family but I did think it was necessary for the sake of the business to say a word about the princess . And that 's when we had our quarrel . I said more than I meant to . And he  --  why he had the audacity to say he would sack me if I mentioned it again . " Chesty gave a dry cackle of a laugh . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the idea of resigning . Just leave him to flounder here by himself . If  --  if I were n't so devoted to this hotel I should have . " Chesty sank back in his chair , suddenly looking exhausted. 138 Murder Makes Us GayHe ran a shaking hand across his forehead and , feeling it moist , brought out a handkerchief to dry it . " Have you any idea why Mr Banks persisted in boarding the princess if he was n't interested in her ? " " Oh , but he was interested in her . Definitely . You 'd have to know Mr Banks as well as I do to understand that . No one could know the princess and not be interested in her . She is charming , beautiful , talented and with all that , an aristocrat . " Chesty 's thin lips twisted in a sardonic smile as he stuffed his handkerchief into his pocket . " It must be very hard to be an aristocrat with no money . On the other hand , it must be very nice to be so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Exactly what do you mean by that ? " " Oh , come , Captain Coburn , you do n't want me to spell it out for you , do you ? It would n't be discreet . It would also be unwise since I have no proof for what I am saying . I told you Mr Banks was ambitious . It 's a nicer word to use than climber . ' " Ray accepted this without comment and for several minutes sat in silence . Then he stood up . " Well , thanks for clearing up some of the smoke . I have just one more question . Did you hear any of the discussions which took place between Paine and Banks ? " Chesty 's face went blank so abruptly , it was comic . He shot Ray a queer look before he replied evasively : " Oh , very little , very little . " " You did n't hear them talking about Naylor ? " " Er  --  well  --  vaguely . I was attending to my work . Paine was more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the height of the season . He should see it then . Of course , this year the cold weather up north has kept the people down here longer . " Ray stood looking at Chesty , who was now fussing withMurder Makes Us Gay z 39papers on his desk . At length he turned on his heel and went out with Denny . In the hall he said , " Well , what do you make of it ? " " I think he knows the gun was there , just as the others did . " " And this about the princess ? " " That 's nothing new . We all know it , and I 've wondered the others did n't kick up a row sooner . I agree with Chesty that it 's no way to do business . " Ray shook his head . " What a setup ! It beats me . " " Did McLaughlin say he was going to arrest Naylor ? " " He sounded damned like it . Said he was coming over in the morning to finish the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PLAYING THATDenny received a note from Laura requesting him to come to her for a few minutes after he had finished playing . So at nine he promptly set out for Laura 's apartment instead of searchingfor Lou who was really on his mind . Laura answered his knock and ushered him into her own small sitting room . The moment he saw her he realized that she had been fretting ever since Ray had told them about the gun . She asked Denny to be seated and passed him the cigarettesbut she herself wandered about the room , from the chaise longue to the window , from the window to the table where she stood looking down at him with a puzzled frown . Then she wandered off again to turn on the fan . Its soft whir combined with the rustle of her long , starched skirt and the hiss of the waves of the incoming tide as they broke along the shore beneath her window . " It 's the heat , " she said suddenly . " I ca n't stand this heat . I ca n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's tuning up for a storm , " Denny replied , catering to her distrait remarks . " The sun went down in black clouds . Another day or two , and we 'll have rain . " Laura did not seem to be listening . She had wandered back to the window where the night insects were beating a tattoo against the screen . Denny smoked in silence , watching her rigid back and wondering when she would reach a decision . After several minutes she came back to the chaise longue . Leaning on its back , she said tensely : " I simply must talk to someone or I 'll go mad and I do n't trust anyone  --  no one ! Not even my mother . It frightens me  --  all this mystery  --  and people . They frighten me more than anything . What does one know about them ? Nothing ? Nothing but their faces . What is behind the face ? Oh , if I only knew that ! If I only knew ! " She pounded the chair in despair . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed in a week . She was n't the same Mrs Banks he had known so long ; she was a new and completely different person . " I finally decided to talk to you for two reasons . One is that you did believe Will was innocent and the other that you do n't belong to us . I mean , I ca n't see any possible connection between you and Harold . You 're an outsider , and therefore I trust you  --  at least a little . " Denny smiled . " Well , thanks . It 's nice to know . " " Please do n't joke . I probably sound silly but I 'm very earnest . " " Look , why do n't you sit down and tell me what 's so terrible that 's new ? All the stuff so far about this case is plenty bad . There ca n't be much that 's worse . " " Oh , but there is , " Laura protested , sinking at last onto the chaise longue . " And you must promise not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 're asking a lot , especially after what happened this142 Murder Makes Us Gayafternoon . It must be some evidence that makes things look worse for him and  --  well , supposing you tell me what it is ? " Laura nervously rubbed her hands together . " Does it have something to do with the night it happened ? " Denny asked as a bait to make her talk . She nodded . " Yes . It 's so horrible to think about , and yet the scene always comes back to me . " " Wo n't you describe it ? Ca n't you start back a little earlier in the day ? Did you know your husband was going to talk to Naylor ? " " Yes , I did . We 'd done nothing but argue since Will came . It was dreadful , and Mother made things worse by criticizing Will , which infuriated Harold because he hated Monte Korne and all men like Monte Korne . You ca n't imagine how awful those few days were . " " Did you persuade him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I  --  pleaded with him and tried to make him see how the two belong together . Billie and Will , I mean . I was in a horrible position . I never realized until the minute I saw Will  --  what I 'd actually done . It was a terrible shock , and for a crazy instant I could n't believe I had done it . Looking back five years , I ca n't really remember exactly how I did come to marry Harold . Is n't that fantastic ? " she asked with a peculiarsmile . Denny admitted that it was and suspected that Will 's reappearanceand Harold 's subsequent death had unbalanced Laura 's mind . She reached for a cigarette and slowly lit it . " It 's odd how things happen . Will and I never had a quarrel that was just a little quarrel such as all couples have . Somehow Mother and Uncle Joshua always managed to develop it into a major crisis . And afterward there was always Mother and Harold . " " In other words , you 've just been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Murder Makes Us Gay 143 " Well , I do n't know . I did n't think so at the time  --  but now  --  in any case , I felt Will should have his share of Billie and so I pleaded with Harold . He was n't very willing . He seemed to hate Will , which struck me as peculiar since he was rather a friend of Will 's in the old days . " " Not so peculiar in view of the fact that he had persuaded you to divorce Will and marry him . We always dislike the people we 've wronged . They keep knocking on our conscience , and it annoys us . " " Perhaps that was it . Anyway , he would n't listen at first but after a while he changed his mind . He said he would arrangeto see him so Mother could n't interfere . He 'd make some arrangement he said . " " Did you know he was going to meet him in the casino ? " " No . But after Tina 's party I asked him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , but I 'm going to now . ' We walked as far as the hall leading to the casino , and there I left him . " " Was anyone else about ? Did they hear him say it to you ? " " They may have . I 'm not sure . I said it as we were leaving the parlor . There are always so many people around that we grow accustomed to them . I might n't have noticed . You see , I was worried and thinking about their meeting . In a way , I wanted to be present and yet  --  I  --  I could n't face Will  --  and hear him  --  and Harold discussing when he could see Billie . It seemed so wrong since Billie is so much like Will  --  and Harold  --  well , he 's not overfond of children . " " So your husband went to the casino . Then what ? " " Well , I came here  --  and waited . " " Did you happen to notice the time ? " " When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the salon has chimes , and they were ringing as I came in . " " Then what happened ? " " I waited and waited  --  until half-past three , when I couldn't144 Murder Makes Us Gaystand it any longer . I went out to the casino . As far as the door . One lamp was on , the one next to the window , and Haroldwas sitting beside it . Will was leaning against the roulette table , looking down at Harold . He seemed to be listening to my husband and -- not particularly angry . I watched another second and then came back here . " " Was your husband talking ? Did you hear what he said ? " " Not at that distance . I only heard the sound of his voice , not the words . " " But he was alive at three-thirty ? Are you positive ? " " Of course . He was gesticulating and  --  of course he was alive . That 's just what is worrying me . " Her agitation had increased again , and now she resumed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see ? " she flung over her shoulder . " The doctors say Harold died at three-thirty , and Will was with him then . " " Yes , I see that all too well . I do n't suppose you heard the shot on your way back here ? " " No . You see , I was relieved to see them talking so quietly that I came back here and decided to take a shower and go to bed . I kept expecting Harold and finally when I got to bed I dozed off . When I next woke up it was four-thirty and when I saw the time I thought Harold must be back , but he was n't . That frightened me , and I got up . " She came back to the chaise longue . She was as white as she had been the night the tragedy had occurred . " I went to the casino a second time  --  and that 's when I found him , " she said despairingly . " Of course you jumped to the conclusion that Will had shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same ? " " I do n't know . Perhaps I should have . Was he lying under the table as we found him ? " Murder Makes Us Gay 145She nodded , pressing a handkerchief to her lips which had begun to tremble . " Have you asked Will about it ? " " He wo n't talk , " she said in a whisper . " All he says is that he did n't shoot Harold . He  --  does n't talk to me much anyway , " she added forlornly . Denny felt like getting up to pace the floor , but it would n't do to have both of them chasing circles about the room . He lit another cigarette instead and pondered upon what she had told him . " Next to having seen him shoot your husband , this story is about the best you could do for Will , " he remarked after a pause . " I told you so . That 's why I wo n't  --  could n't tell anyone else . And I 'm terrified that if they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I wo n't  --  I wo n't ! I 'll not do anything to make things worse for Will . I wo n't help to convict him . I 'll  --  I 'll kill myself first . " Denny raised an eyebrow . Suicide threats seemed to run in the Leighton family  --  only that Laura was in dead earnest about it . " But supposing he did shoot your husband ? " " I do n't care if he did , " Laura said wildly . " He must have been provoked  --  or  --  I do n't know what happened . All I know is I 'll not testify against him . " " He 's not indicted yet . " " No , but he 's going to be . I 'm sure he is . The situation is so obvious . So damning . " " The situation , yes , but the proof  --  not so good . The prosecuting attorney will have to work up a lot of feeling against Will . " Laura made an impatient gesture . " I hear the remarks made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Poor fellow , ' they say , it 's easy to understand why he did it . But after146 Murder Makes Us Gayall , murder is murder  --  even with the best provocation in the world . ' The worst thing is that they are so sure he 's guilty that they feel sorry for him and hope the jury will return a verdict with a recommendation for mercy . Life imprisonment ! Think how awful , how terrible that would be for Will . My God ! If we only could do something , instead of sitting here and letting that hateful McLaughlin collect evidence against him . " " He 's collecting evidence  --  but not particularly against Will . He has n't arrested him yet , and even if he does it does n't mean Will is convicted , " Denny said calmly , hoping to curb her hysteria by his own placidity . " Will must have some story . If you can persuade him to tell his version maybe we could make some progress . Until he does he 's blocking any chance of finding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've thought and thought about it , " Laura lamented with great dejection . " I ought to be able to supply some other personbesides Will  --  but I ca n't . I really ca n't . The trouble is , you see , that Harold was so reserved . He never told me anything unless I asked questions , and most of the time I was n't interested enough to ask any . " Denny paid little attention to her murmurs of regret . He was trying to visualize the scenes at three-thirty and again at four-thirty as she had described them . At a little after four Naylor was lying in his room asleep . That left approximately thirty-five minutes unexplained . " Look here , " he said suddenly , realizing that his hour of intermission was almost over , " just what do you want me to do , aside from playing father-confessor ? " " I was hoping you could help him , " Laura replied wistfully . " There must be some explanation , and I thought you might find it . " Denny shook his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You ca n't just pick a solution out of the air , you know . " Murder Makes Us Gay 147 " I know , I know . But you can try , ca n't you ? " she asked desperately . " You have some knowledge of law and cases . Does n't that help you ? " Her remark caused Denny to smile ruefully . What did he remember after eight years ? Next to nothing . Of course he need not disillusion Laura on that score and so he replied with becoming modesty that he would do his best . The way she looked at him  --  like a drowning man at a good , solid raft  --  made him very uncomfortable . " Mr Seabury has advised me to engage a Mr Lucius Gordon , who is supposed to be very good . " " Yes , he 's good all right . But he is also one of those criminal lawyers who have a reputation for defending men with the evidence stacked against them . I think sometimes he does more harm than good to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If they are guilty he 's the best man you can get . " Poor Laura looked so confused and unhappy that Denny added hastily : " Let 's hope you wo n't need any lawyer . " This transparent optimism did little to cheer Laura , and Denny left feeling torn between pity and impatience . If only she were not so passive , so docile  --  such a damned fool  --  maybe all this mess would n't have happened , he told himself on the way to the Crystal Court where the dancing was to be . A large crowd was present , and the band had to work hard , but still the night dragged interminably . The only bright spot for Denny was when he took his midnight recess for a walk along the parapet and found Lou loitering there . She was being carried along on a billowing white organdy skirt , and since such elegance was not customary for Louise Brookes Denny almost passed her by as one of the guests . Her husky little laugh stopped him in his tracks . Denny caught her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near-by kiosks . She followed under protest and when they148 Murder Makes Us Gaywere secure in its shadows and Denny proceeded to embrace her she submitted still under protest . Her lips were very sweet but oh , so cool that Denny came down to earth with a chill . " All right , let 's skip it . Have you got anything on your mind beside the desire to deprive me of my few remaining wits ? " " No , I just came out tonight to see what I could see and to hear what I could hear . " " Admirable intentions . Did something in particular inspire them ? " Denny gave her a cigarette and , as he lit it , studied her face in the flickering yellow light . " Nothing except that Ray told me McLaughlin intends to arrest poor Will Naylor tomorrow . Also , I heard from Sunny that Mr Paine is asking the princess to pay up or vamoose . Also , Paine telegraphed his buddies on the mainland that he was closing the hotel the first of May . Thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sighed involuntarily and concluded unhappily , " It does seem so terrible to have all this glamour and gaiety going full tilt while Banks has been dead hardly a week and Naylor  --  do you think he is guilty , Denny ? " " Yesterday I would have said no but today I 'm not so sure . " Lou accepted his reply in silence . After a pause , during which both contemplated the melancholy significance of his remark , she said : " Should n't you be going back ? " " I guess so . If you see Ray will you ask him to come to the casino at two ? " " But it ' 11 be closed . " " I know . I just want to have a look around with him . " " The police have already looked holes in the place . You could n't possibly find anything they did n't . " " You never can tell , " Denny quoted blandly . He walked back along the parapet with Lou , taking great pains to suppress his yearning sighs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left him and was soon lost among the paths of the dark gardens where her white dress showed between the bushes like a bit of white down . The next two hours seemed like five to Denny . But eventuallythe final note was played , and he was free to go to the casino . The last of the gamblers were straggling out from the salons , and the lights over the tables had been extinguished . Reynoldswas chatting with two croupiers who were closing up for the night with a speed and efficiency engendered only by long training . One of the night cleaners was briskly emptying ash trays and picking up what odds and ends of papers , empty cigarette cartons , forgotten pencils lay about , preparatory for the vacuum-cleaner crew who came the first thing in the morning . He shoved the chairs back to their proper places , pulled a table till it stood in the center of the group , jerked the cords of a dozen floor lamps , thus gradually extinguishing the friendly glow . The two overhead chandeliers threw a matwhitelight which gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worn-out look . Denny asked the man as he was about to leave , " Do you do this every night ? " The man gave a pensive scratch to his chin and looked Denny over before answering laconically : " Yeah , every night . " " Slick at it , are n't you ? " " Sure . We 've got to be  --  or else . Why ? " " Nothing . I was just wondering . " " Say , you would n't be another detective , would you ? " " Why ? Do n't you like them ? " Denny asked with a laugh . The man vehemently shook his head . " No sir . They ask too damned many questions and always the same ones . They 're either dumb or hard of hearing . " " Thanks for the warning . I wo n't try to ask you any . " 150 Murder Makes Us GayThe man nodded in agreement and trotted out of the door with his dustpan . Reynolds followed him . He hesitated as he passed Denny but decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suited Denny perfectly because he wanted to look the room over before Ray should arrive . He crossed to the two chairs and table where Banks had been shot . The stained one had been removed , and in its place was a gold-brocaded wing chair . Denny stood looking at it and then at the table against which , according to Laura 's story , Naylor had been leaning at three-thirty . He tried to visualize the scene and imagine what might have happened . The chair and table were at least fifty feet from the door . The room occupied a corner of the building with three arched windows along the drive . The various salons of the casino were separated by filigree walls which ran three quarters of their height and were banded along the top with ornate mosaics . These open walls made the rooms much cooler and yet to some extent guarded their privacy . In order to maintain the harmonyof the decorations , the second outside wall was also filigreedbut reinforced on the exterior with heavy screens hooked into the arches . If Banks were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have shot him was Naylor . The distance to the door leading to the next room was almost as far as the door leading to the hall , and the medical examiner had said Banks was shot not more than three or four feet away and from the right-hand direction . The more Denny pondered it the more impatient he was to hear Naylor 's story , because if Naylor did not shoot Banks he must certainly know who did . No man could come near enough to shoot Banks and reach either door without Naylor 's seeing him . One of the croupiers came up to Denny and informed himMurder Makes Us Gay 151that he room was to be closed . Instead of answering him on that , Denny asked : " Are you one of the men who was on duty last Saturday ? " The man 's sallow but rather pleasant face assumed an expression of painful resignation . " Yes , I was . I must have answered a million questions about it . Do you have to ask me some more ? " " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Denny replied with a grin . " Well , do n't . The police have it all down in black and white . Ask them . Are you leaving now ? " " Not just yet . I 'm expecting Captain Coburn . " " Oh . " The man wavered , and then finally his longing to be gone overcame his prudence . " Well , you 'll have to tell the night watchman when you do leave , so he can throw off the switch . Good night . " " I 'll attend to it . Good night . " The croupier hurried off , and Denny was left alone in the large room . He sat in the gold-brocaded chair and sank into a melancholy reverie . It was while he was absorbed in these vague surmises that Naylor came in . He was right next to Denny before the latter realized his presence . " It 's just what I do , " Naylor said without preliminaries . " It does n't help . The facts remain . " " But it is also an irrefutable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did . " " You 've said that before . " " I know . I keep repeating it because it 's the only tangible fact I have . " Naylor smiled while he pulled out a pack of cigarettes and offered them to Denny . " Mrs Banks has told me what happened as far as she knows it , " Denny said , tapping his cigarette on his thumbnail . " Why do n't you tell me your side ? At three-thirty you were talking to Banks who was alive and at  --  say four-ten Ray and152 Murder Makes Us GayI stood in your room , watching you sleep . What happened in between ? " Naylor was startled by Denny 's remark , and his surprise was so obvious that Denny asked : " Has n't Ray told you ? " " No . Why did you come ? What were you doing in my room ? " " Ray was worried about you . You 'd had a row with Polly  --  remember ? And he wanted to see that you 'd calmed down all right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh . I begin to see . " Naylor leaned against the table and folded his arms . He assumed the pose unthinkingly , but it reminded Denny of that other night . " We 'd just finished looking you over when the alarm about Banks was spread . I must say you got to sleep in a hurry after either murdering a man or seeing it done . " Naylor grimaced wryly . " A veronal tablet will work won-ders . " " I do n't doubt it . But as long as we 've gotten this near to the truth why not relieve my torture and tell me what did happen ? This must be the tenth time I 've asked you . " Naylor favored Denny with a look that was half compassion and half gratitude . Denny thought he was an exceedingly good-looking chap , now that the semitropical sun had routed his prison pallor . If he were n't so haggard and tense he would be more like his old self . " Well ? " Denny asked as the pause lengthened . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warn you , " Naylor said slowly , still hesitant . " I get streaks where I think that maybe I did shoot him after all , that maybe I have blind spots in my memory . " Murder Makes Us Gay 153 " Do n't be an ass . If you ever tried shooting a man you would n't have any blind spots about it . " " I 'm not so sure . You see  --  I have n't the slightest recollection of having driven through those two barriers when I killed the old man . I never did have . It drives me crazy sometimes , trying to remember . Of course I may have had it knocked out of me with that concussion . But I do n't know  --  I do n't know , " Naylor repeated in a desperate way . " That time was different . You had been drinking and " But that 's just it . If I 'd been drunk do you think teetotaler Uncle Joshua would have let me drive him to the station ? I 'd had two or three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Well , let 's get back to last Saturday night . What happened ? You were standing there , and Banks was sitting here . Then what ? You may as well admit that you were here because Mrs Banks said she saw you , and I believe her . " " So Laura does n't even care enough to give me a break , " Naylor said bitterly . " Oh , she 's only trying to help you . If it 's any satisfaction to you she said she would kill herself rather than testify against you . " Laura would n't do a thing like that because of Billie . " " I would n't be too sure . She 's mighty stirred up and since she is the only one who saw you here she will be the only one who can testify to your presence here . So far the police have had only the supposition based on Bank 's phone call to you , and that is n't incontestable proof . Now if we could just find out who really shot Banks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Well , you 'll have to be a magician to do it , because as far as I make out the murderer is  --  the invisible man . " XIIBEFORE DENNY HAD TIME TO DIGEST NAYLOR 'S REMARKabout invisible murderers Ray appeared in the doorway . Denny had , up to that moment , always welcomed the sight of the tall , black-haired captain , but this was one time when he wished him miles away . Naylor promptly receded into himself like a turtle pulling in its head , and Denny had little hopes of hearingthe rest of his story . Ray joined them , and though he looked tired enough to go to sleep on his feet he managed a fairly cheerful grin . " Your two trusties are moaning over the fact that you never go to bed , " he said to Naylor . In a place like Coral Island there was no question of discreetshadowing . The " tails " McLaughlin had put on Naylor had no choice but to flaunt themselves behind him , and Naylor had quite simply promoted them to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die doing their duty but who still thought Coral Island a swell place to sleep . " I told them to relax while I was here , " Ray continued , 154Murder Makes Us Gay 155 " and I think they are going to snooze on the powder-blue divans across the way . " " I hope they dream of houris . There 's plenty of stuff for such dreams around here . The poor fellows watch the glamourparade from the Cabana Club and sit on their hands so they wo n't be tempted to touch , " Naylor remarked indulgently . He had relaxed a little and , though still wary , at least showed no signs of leaving . Ray must have sensed the situation , for instead of plying either of them with questions he went on casually discussing the hotel until Denny interrupted the amiableflow of that harmless conversation . " Before you came we were having a very interesting discussion . Something you 've never heard  --  namely  --  how Banks was shot . " " So ? Anything new ? " For a moment Denny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slight shrug which signified both resignation and acquiescence . Having gained this much , Denny hastily described what Laura had told him , expecting every instant to have Naylor interrupt him . However , he reached Naylor 's peculiar remark without a hitch and was gratified to see Ray look as puzzled as he must have . " It really is n't as fantastic as it sounds , " Naylor said a trifle impatiently . " I was standing here , and Banks was squirming about in that chair . He had just come to his so-called propositionand was leaning forward to emphasize it when the shot came . " Both Denny and Ray involuntarily pressed closer to Naylor , who hardly seemed to notice them . It was more as though he were describing the scene to himself in order to understand it . " It was very quiet in here , and the shot was loud enough to fill the whole place with noise . I jumped a mile myself , and then Banks  --  sort of keeled over and slid to the floor . I stood156 Murder Makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him over . He was dead then . Whoever did the shooting was a swell marksman . I stared around the room  --  rather stupidly I 'm afraid  --  and then I realized that he had been shot through the wall . I looked out through the holes into the court ; nobody was there . It could n't have been two minutes since it happened , but the place was empty . I had n't heard anyone walk , and there are flagstones out there , so I should have . I did go out  --  I went the whole length of the court and at the end almost bumped into the night watchman . He was ambling along very placidly , so I was certain he had n't heard or seen anything . " " Your guess was right , " Ray said tersely . " Old Jeff checked his clock at three-thirty by the Lily Court and said there was nobody about and no shooting . " " I ca n't understand why no one heard the shot . It was so loud . I expected everybody to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was getting panicky . You have n't been through what I have , without seeing all the bad sides of a situation before you see the good ones . I thought how cockeyed my story would sound and how everybody would jump to the conclusion that I 'd shot Banks , just as they have . Well , if nobody knew I was there maybe I could get by , I figured . I was n't only thinking of myself ; in fact , I was n't thinking at all . I was acting according to instinct . I wanted to get away before anybody saw me but I also wanted to have a chance to get to bed before anybody found him , which is why I put him under the table . I hoped he would n't be found until later in the morning . I 'm sorry I did it now . " " Well , it certainly did n't help any , " Ray remarked dryly . " You robbed yourself by giving the murderer the same help you planned to give yourself . " " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've counted all the mistakes I made , so you need n't list them . My only excuse is that I was rattled  --  and scared  --  yes , plenty scared , and youMurder Makes Us Gay r 57would have been , too , if you had been in my place . Remember I 'd been free less than a week and  --  here  --  was something  --  much worse than last time . It was  --  devilish . " " It must have been , " Denny remarked with keen sympathy . " I 'd have been just as crackbrained as you were . But who on earth did fire the gun , do you suppose , and where did he go to ? After all , the night man is trained to see prowlers . He could n't have passed him , and there are only two ways out of the Lily Court . One you came through , and the other old Jeff passed . " " That 's why I said he must have been invisible . " Ray had gone to the section of wall beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 've done that too . There is n't a scratch or mark . " " But the wire netting outside " Ah , that 's what I thought , but the screens are hung in sections and fasten with catches at the bottom . I suppose they are replaced by boards when the hotel is closed . At any rate , they swing very easily , and apparently the one for that section was lifted up . I tried it and could do it all right . " " Hump . Somebody must know the hotel damned well to make use of this setup , " Ray said , still fingering the openwork . " Just try looking through it and see what a nuisance all that fancy carving is . Still , I know there was no one in the court when I looked out . " " Somebody must have known of your meeting with Banks . He knew that this place is deserted after two o'clock and that if Banks was shot in your presence you 'd have a fine time explainingit , " Denny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person to the role . " If you tell this to McLaughlin he 'll sneer at an imaginary murderer . Someone I invented to distract attention from myself , " Naylor said wearily , his brilliant eyes searching Ray 's face anxiously. 158 Murder Makes Us GayRay straightened and shoved his hands into his pockets . He nodded thoughtfully . " I 'm afraid you 're right . McLaughlin would n't believe it possible for a person to fire the gun , snap the screen into place and run ten yards  --  all silently and all invisibly . Not with Jeff on one end and you on the other . It is a bit difficult to picture . " " Could n't he have hidden in the court ? " Denny asked , knowing the question to be futile . The Lily Court was a plain little place opening onto the drive , paved with flagstones which circled the lily pond . There was no colonnade , no corners , no recesses where a man could hide . " I went the whole length of it and back , " Naylor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have seen the man ? Remember , I was looking for him . " " Then he got by Jeff . Maybe he was n't as alert as he should be . These grounds are black as pitch that early in the morning when the moon has set and most of the lights are out . He may have slid by in the shadows . " " Well , of course , that 's the explanation I 've reached , " Naylor agreed . " But still , Jeff is a sharp individual , and he 's positive no one went along the drive in either direction . He could n't have come into the building at this end because the night clerk would have seen him or Snarks would have . If I had had the slightest hint I would have told you sooner , but  --  you see how it is . " Denny and Ray saw all too well . Now that Naylor had told them what he knew the situation was not one whit better for him . Their silence was eloquent . Naylor said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It does n't matter much and it is just as well to have as few people as possible know about this . I 'll go over the reports and see if there is anything I can match up with it . You say Banks was on the point of making a proposition . Was it about your son ? " Murder Makes Us Gay 159 " I assume it was , although he did n't have time to tell me about it . He just leaned forward gesticulating a little , and that made him a perfect target for the person outside . He had been none too cordial and had spent the first quarter of an hour telling me why I should n't have come here . " " He used to be a friend of yours , was n't he ? " Denny asked . Naylor laughed . " Used to ' is right . Looking at him now , I wonder why I ever liked him . Of course , back in the good old days I was too much up in the clouds to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at bridge . " " Was he Polly 's friend ? " Naylor rubbed his chin . " I rather think he was . I believe he sold her a car and taught her how to drive  --  or something . Polly and I were never great friends , so what she did was of little interest to me . " " Maybe it should have been , " Denny muttered . " I think I could do with a drink . How about going to The Squid ? " Naylor was unenthusiastic , but Ray was game . So the three notified the night watchman and then set out for the village . " Did you see Lou ? " Denny asked as they clicked down the stone stairs . " Yes . We went to Charlie 's . " " Was the dancing nice ? " Denny asked sarcastically . " Swell ! " Ray 's blandness was infuriating , but Denny refrained from voicing his opinion . " I 'd like to be a guest on this island , " Naylor interposed tactfully . " A guest with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be pretty close to heaven . " " Especially with the right girl , " Ray detailed with a chuckle . " And there are always barracudas handy when you want toget rid of a particular pest , " Denny pointed out .
