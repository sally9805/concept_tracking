On Dec. 27 TIME War Correspondent James Shepley left Supreme Allied headquarters in France , flew to New York . Within the bounds of security , this is his report on the German counter offensive . <P> Rundstedt set up his attack like a chessmaster . Good guesswork or good forecasting told him the Rhine Valley would be covered with weather the first two weeks of December . Under such a blanket he moved divisions with a minimum chance of Allied air observation . His G-2 never functioned better . <P> The four U.S. armies facing him were on the offensive and their deployment obviously was offensive . General Eisen hower could not possibly have held an impregnable line from the North Sea to Strasbourg and at the same time mobilized sufficient strength to attack the Siegfried Line and the inner defenses of the Rhine Valley . <P> From the Aachen salient to the Third Army 's drive into Germany at Saarlautern , the U.S. lines were thinly held by divisions resting from combat . At the last minute , when ground reconnaissance finally picked up traces of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Bastogne to strengthen the line along the German-Luxembourg frontier . <P> The night of Dec. 1.5 Rundstedt 's guns began to hammer with deadly precision at the U.S. positions on the Belgium-Luxembourg front . His attack was swift and sure . Spearheaded by the 1st SS Panzer-the Adolf Hitler Division-his point rammed two U.S. divisions on the northern flank , overran a third like a tidal wave . <P> For this desperate push Rundstedt threw away the rule book . There were reports that hundreds of U.S. prisoners were stripped and shot for their clothing and identification tags . In any event the leading elements of the German columns were in many cases American jeeps loaded with German troops in U.S. uniforms and equipment complete to dog tags . German tanks and trucks were marked with American stars . The deception was highly successful and forced U.S. Military Police to make time-consuming checks of all vehicles using the roads in northern France and Belgium . American slang and American lore became the one sure test to pass an MP . <P> For the first three days of the breakthrough the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rundstedt . From the fourth day until last week the Ninth Air Force had some clear hours every day to press home its attack on German motor columns and supply trains . <P> That was Rundstedt 's first upset . The second was the heroic refusal of the 101st Airborne to be overrun at Bastogne . The Americans ' northern peg held firm when a regiment of one of the overrun divisions refused to give ground and enabled First Army divisions to the north to wheel in on that flank . <P> If it had missed the concentration of Rundstedt 's power , American intelligence was quick to recover . By the end of the second day 17 German divisions had been identified in the attack .
