SCENE : An invasion barge is dimly outlined in the darkness against the vast side of a transport . Men with full packs and wearing helmets stand with their backs to the audience quietly waiting for a signal . Several men are still in the process of climbing down the rope ladder hanging from the side of the transport into the barge . A FIRST SERGEANT , upstage and facing the audience , happens to catch the light on his face from a briefly opened porthole . He speaks peremptorily , but softly . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU I want the signal right on the nose , Abe . ABE Opening the porthole wideYou 'll get it . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU From you or from the corporal ? ABE From me , you suspicious bastard . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU That 's what I wanted to know . Porthole closes part of the way . A silence WINKLE How long we going to wait here , Sarge ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU That 's a bright , intelligent question . We 're going to wait here till they tell us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't take me in on the over-all planning of this operation , but looking at the way the barges are lined up , I judge we 'll be the last to cast off . Captain Johnson 's in the lead , then the three lieutenants  --  and we 're fifth with a lousy first sergeant commanding . SIMEON O.K. , O.K. , we know you 're lousy . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Before we start moving , I want every man to check his ammunition . Be sure you 've got it and you can reach it quick . They feel for their ammunition in the dark . Be sure your pieces are locked . They try the safety catches . Now loosen the slings on all packs and guns . If we 're fired on before we land , we may find ourselves in the water , and you may have to get rid of your stuff in a hurry . MART I only hope somebody knows where that muckin , bench is . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Somebody does . The captain 's got a French fisherman with him . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose sight of him and end up making a commando raid on the south of France . But the chances are we 'll follow right up on the beach at Oran , and nothing worse 'll happen to us than getting our feet wet . A short pause SIMEON What 's the name of that town again ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Have you managed to forget Oran after all we said ? SIMEON Well , they changed it , Chooley Macally , they changed it . First they said it was Rabat  --  and all those damn names sound like double-talk , anyway . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU If we 're going to be sitting here a while , I 'd better go over the whole set-up . We 're landing on the beach just east of Oran . If anybody gets lost from the outfit he can follow the coastline west and he 'll get to the city docks  --  and they 're going to be damn soon held by Americans . We 're going to be met at the beach by a Frenchman who 'll know the password . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , say " Whiskey " to him and he 'll respond with the same sacred word . He 'll have some Arabs with him with donkeys and camels to carry our heavy stuff , and they wo n't know the password or any English at all . Do n't get excited and shoot ' em before you know who they are . On the other hand if we meet with opposition  --  that is , if there 's any enemy action  --  have your arms ready for trouble . Do n't get yourself killed because the other fellow fired first . SIMEON How are we going to know enemy action if it happens , Sarge ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU I 'm damned if I know , Simeon . I never landed on the coast of Africa before , any more than you did . Try to keep close enough to the officers to hear all orders given . Do n't show any light . CHELLIE Are you scared , Sarge ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Hell , yes . Who is n't ? My guts are sticking to my backbone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scared of ? If you 're dead you never know it , and if you 're alive you 're lucky . This is the real thing . A lot of people never get a chance to see the real thing , and we 're seeing it . SIMEON You 're doing a hell of a lot of talking , Peter . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU ( 1st Sergeant ) . I 'm nervous . I 'm talking to cover it up . Another thing .  --  We 're a company of infantry and I 've heard some fellows bitching about being in the infantry . They want to be in the Navy or the artillery or the air force . Let me tell you something . The infantry is still the queen of battles . When the artillery gets stuck it sends for us . When the air force gets all through bombing we have to march in . When the Navy gets to the edge of the water that 's as far as it goes . That 's where we take over . The infantry is it . We 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important . He turns and looks off. p. 4 SIMEON You 're telling me ! MART Do n't I know ! SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Not a glimmer of light anywhere . Nothing but black water . This could be Long Island Sound or the Gulf of Mexico , or the Pacific Ocean just as well as the Mediterranean . WINKLE What 's that Arab word for " no " ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Turning backLak . We might as well go over our whole muckin ' Arabic vocabulary while we 're at it . What does " Izek " mean ? MART How are you . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU " Hamdulala " ? CHELLIE Allah with you . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU What 's the word for " yes " ? WINKLE Aywa . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU How do you say , " Wait here " ? CHELLIE Estana henna . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU What 's the word for " Thank you " ? SIMEON Checka . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU That 's right . Sounds like " check . " That 's a way to remember it . Count up to three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Is that as far as you go ? DOUGIE I was hoping I would n't need any more . Three beers . " Telata beera . " SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Suppose four of you wanted to order beer ? SIMEON You could order two beers twice . DOUGIE Or three or four times . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU As a matter of fact there wo n't be any beer . And no whiskey either . MART My feet ! There is a general stir among the men. p. 5 SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Cut it out , you guys ! Nine-tenths of a war is waiting , and the other tenth is worse . The word for " Come here " is " Ishma . " SIMEON How do you say " Come to papa " ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Stay away from those Arab women . If you do n't get a knife in your back you 'll get something worse . DOUGIE Did you leave a girl behind anywhere , Sarge ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU I left so many girls behind if they all got together it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As beautiful as that ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU I like ' em beautiful . DOUGIE Do n't you ever go steady with one ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU When it comes to girls a soldier has to live off the country . SIMEON I had a dream once about a place called Detroit . DOUGIE Was there a girl in it ? SIMEON You bet your Chooley Macalley there was a girl in it . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU It 's no time to be thinking about girls , when you 're pretty soon going to be creeping up a beach with a bayonet stuck out four feet in front of you . SIMEON How the hell did I get into this situation ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU I know how I got here . I got drafted , the same as the rest of you . I did n't want to be a soldier . Nobody did , only we knew the job had to be done , and we had to do it . And the only way to fight a war is to make the other fellow so Goddam sorry he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it again . And the only kind of soldier to be is the best there is . That 's why we went through all that infiltration hell . We 've got to be so good they 'll never want to see us again . There is a distant explosion , then a breathless pause , and another explosion nearer . A far-away burst of machine-gun fire is heard. p. 6 DOUGIE Are they shooting at us ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU It does n't sound exactly like a twenty-gun salute , does it ? That 's right , you sons-of-bitches ! Shoot your friends down as fast as they come in ! ABE Porthole opens . From withinTry to keep wide to port , out of reach of those harbor guns . The motor starts . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU You hear that Chellie ? CHELLIE I heard it . ABE We 're all set to turn you loose , Pete . Griffin and the Captain are under way . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Swing those gun butts over to fend us off when we let go . The men obey . Any time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The muffled engine turns up a bit louder . The MEN lean outward as the boat starts. @x SCENE : An officers ' tent , covered by a camouflage net , which has been pitched in the open outside Maknassy . To either side of it are similar tents . A flap , partly opened , leads to the interior of the tent . A field telephone attached to two G.I. packing boxes down Left . A teletype machine against the wall of the center tent between the flap and the Left net pole . A cot in front of the Left tent . Two or three scattered about the stage . A table and two chairs downstage Right . Between the tents one can see the near-by city  --  or village  --  consisting of a number of round , brown hive-like thatched native huts and a few white-washed square houses . It 's early morning in April . The sky is blue and cloudless . AT RISE : Offstage , a MUEZZIN is chanting a prayer . A private , DOUGIE , is standing guard before the Center tent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a yakmish , are kneeling in prayer upstage . The teletype is clicking out a message . The phone rings .

DOUGIE looks to left and right , then goes to the phone and answers . MART Private MacDougal . Yeah . No . O.K. I 'll have to call Mart . He puts the receiver down . Hey , Mart  --  are you supposed to answer the phone  --  or not ? p. 8 MART Entering from between the tents LeftA man 's human , you know . He goes to the phone . DOUGIE I would n't know about you . MART Sycamore talking . That you , Kelly ? This is Mart . Yeah , the sun 's out this morning , but it looks like it 's going to be another scorcher today . I can read the report . We lost twenty-one men and a lieutenant in the landing and fourteen two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Peter 's around with his arm in a sling . The captain 's up at the forward command post and one of the louies is with him . The other louie went back to Gafsa for mail . Well , I 'll try to give you a rough idea . About thirty of the regular outfit  --  the rest scattered up and down the road moving stuff . And seven or eight crazy bastards belonging to some Signal Installation Company , with Simeon riding herd . No , he 's one of our own , but he 's just as crazy . Only seven wounded right now . Then we 've got a crazy French paratroop officer  --  that took an oath he would n't smile till Hitler was dead , and a couple of crazy American nurses , one of whom has been jumping off the tops of tanks lately . Because she thinks maybe she 's And she thinks maybe that 'll cure it .  --  I do n't know , but I suspect the muckin ' 1st Army .  --  About two miles west of here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We could certainly use a replacement .  --  I get you . One Australian nurse , one American nurse , one British captain and a radar . We 'll take care of them when they turn up . And we 'll send back the jumping one for inventory and a recount.  --  I said we 'll take care of it . Go take a tablet and tell the colonel to do the same . Roger . Snafu . He hangs up . A number of ARAB WOMEN go through , upstage , from Left to Right . DOUGIE looks at them and whistles . You ought to stop them from going through here , Dougie . p. 9 DOUGIE I got orders not to stop ' em because when we set up the tents we thought this was a sort of vacant lot but it turns out there 's a kind of local Knights of Columbus hall over on that side and this is the way to it . Two more ARAB WOMEN cross upstage Left to right . MART It 's a mosque , you dope . DOUGIE O.K. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church . DOUGIE O.K. , it 's a church . MART Crossing to teletypeIt 's where the muezzin appears on the mezzanine and orders general prayers . Five times a day he comes out like a cuckoo out of a clock , and every time every Mussulman has to flop in the dust and talk to Allah . DOUGIE Crossing to MARTYeah , you 're the guy that read the handbook . MART You mean you did n't ? Several more ARAB WOMEN cross upstage Left to Right . DOUGIE Why should I plow through all that stuff ? Somebody always tells you . MART crosses to table . One of them native women gave me the glad-eye yesterday . Could n't see anything but her eyes , but , boy , did she make them eyes talk ! p. 10 MART There was plenty in that handbook about native women . DOUGIE I do n't want to hear it . Every day I stay here they look whiter to me . I 'll bet when you unwrap ' em they 're not so different from Brooklyn . A BREAD-SELLER , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loaves like cord-wood comes in from the Left . You better call the mess-sergeant . He was hoping he could buy some bread . MART Hey , Goober ! Bread . BREAD SELLER Say  --  ee-da , effendi . MART Hello , George . WINKLE From off RightGoober 's at the market . MART Get Simeon , then . WINKLE I do n't know where Simeon is . MART Aw , nuts .

The MUEZZIN is heard chanting from the Left , and the BREAD SELLER falls with his face to the east , gabbling a prayer . There is a NATIVE WOMAN passing through , upstage from Left to Right , who also prays . THE MUEZZIN Ullah Akbar ! Ashed wullah elehheh ullala , ou ashed wenah Mohammed errusool Ullah ! Haya alla Salat ! Haya alla falah ! Ullah Akbar ! Ashed wullah eleh-heh ullala ! DOUGIE Now what in hell are they doing ? MART Leafing through a handbook " You will observe many puzzling sights and strange practises among the native population . Do not be disturbed by them , and above all do not interfere . " Period . The MUEZZIN finishes his prayers . DOUGIE Ai n't it the truth ?

PETER enters from between the tents Left and crosses to the table . He has a sheaf of papers in his right hand . The left is in a sling and there is a wide bandage across his chest as if he had got a bullet through the left shoulder . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Hey , Simeon . SIMEON Pete , I 've been looking for you . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Yeah ! I 've been looking for you . The line between here and the Sened C.P. has been cut . Can you get that patched up before lunch ? SIMEON There 's no Jerries in there . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU It must have been Arabs then , because the line 's cut . And the old man wants it in a hurry . SIMEON The sappers have n't been through there yet ! There 's mines all along the road and booby-traps at every pole . I 'm losing half my men already on those pioneer jobs . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU We got to fix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all my men who 's going to get me more ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU He sits . All right , do n't fix it . p. 16 SIMEON Hell , Peter , I ai n't no moisenflay ; we 'll fix it ; but if we lose the war do n't blame me . I did n't send in signal corps to do sappers ' work . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU You get out there and blow up those booby-traps and miss those mines . And if you get yourself killed , I 'll hold it against you , because I need you for something else tonight . SIMEON What ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU I want you to come up to the front with me . There 's artillery lines cut all over the place  --  SIMEON Jeez  --  have n't they got any installation corps up there  --  ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU You come with me . I need you .

SIMEON Leading him to the LeftLook , we 're driving along the Gafsa road last night and we see a celebration going on  --  SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU What do you mean ? SIMEON You know , a lot of Arabs yif-yiffing in the desert , around a fire  --  a kind of horse-thieves ' convention  --  and we get out and go over to it , and there 's a kind of auctioneer moisenflaying around , getting the crowd all Chooley Macalleyed , and pretty soon he 's selling some girls  --  SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Girls ? SIMEON Shhhhh ! SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU I told you to lay off that white wine . SIMEON Honest to God . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU They do n't sell girls .

MART enters from between tents Right . SIMEON Nothing . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Did you say you bought one ? SIMEON Eight hundred francs . MART Do n't let him fool you , Pete . He paid exactly ten francs for that bread . SIMEON The most beautiful hunk of morale in all North Africa . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Where is it ? SIMEON Out in the weapons carrier . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU You 're crazy . SIMEON I certainly am . I 'm crazy about morale . MART I 've got a whole sheaf of orders for you , Pete . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Let me have ' em .

SERGEANT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to writeShoot. p. 19 MART Looking at his notesFirst , there 's a radar coming up and it 's to be installed temporarily for the use of the artillery recognizance group . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Where ? MART I do n't know where . On a hill , I suppose . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Are they sending an expert ? MART No . It 'll have directions with it . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU How much does it weigh ? MART Sixteen hundred pounds . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Looks like a job for Simeon . SIMEON Peter , look , give me a break , will you ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU You freeze right where you are , front and center , and sweat it out . MART Then  --  the whole line 's moving up tonight toward Mazzouna and Sekhira . We 're going to fit in under this ridge , right here . He shows a map . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Taking mapAnything on the teletype about that ? MART Yeah . He hands PETER the teletype sheet. p. 20 SIMEON Pete ! SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU After examining the orderI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gafsa on the train and two more are coming up as replacements . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Right . MART Then there 's an English liaison officer coming to travel with the company . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Eighth Army ? MART I did n't ask . I think so . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Sure . If we break through toward Sekhira we 'll meet the Eighth coming up the Coast , and he 's here to cushion the shock . O.K. MART He 's expert on this region , too . You 're supposed to consult with him about the positions we take up . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU O.K. If he 'll talk to a sergeant . Somebody sounds the triangle for breakfast . DOUGIE Breakfast , Pete ! SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Where the hell 's Captain Johnson ? MART Down at the French C.P. near Kebili . He 'll try to join us in the morning . p. 21 SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU That 's a juicy little bunch of assignments . The telephone rings . Answer your phone , Mart . MART goes to phone . MART Sycamore rear . SERGEANT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be here for a while . Consider yourself relieved . DOUGIE Thanks , Sarge . He exits right . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU First of all , you did n't buy anybody . Slavery is abolished . SIMEON No , but just the same I gave them the money and they gave me the girl . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Simeon , if anybody could turn this war into a travelling circus you 'd do it . In the middle of a black night , raining like Tophet , you came into camp with a baby camel lost from its mother . You did n't see any reason why you could n't keep it . You came back from a day 's leave in Tabessa with three baby chimpanzees you adopted . Thought they 'd be nice for mascots . Now you pick up a dirty female Moslem wearing a yakmish and with no education which she can use standing up . Huh-uh . SIMEON Look , Peter  --  be human , will you ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU You 've been away from the States too long , boy . Anything female looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these Arab girls , too , you know . Mostly they 're homely as sin , as dirty as the ground they walk on , and probably highly infectious in more ways than one . What 's more , they 're circumcised . p. 22 SIMEON The girls ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Yes , the girls . SIMEON Who told you ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU It 's common knowledge . You take her back where she comes from and fix that telephone . SIMEON Look , Chooley Macalley  --  I ca n't take her back because the camp 's gone  --  there 's nobody there  --  and what 's more she says she belongs to me and she wants to go where I go . She 's moisenflay about me . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU What do you talk to her  --  Arabic or double-talk or the language of love ? Suppose you really wanted to say something to the girl ? SIMEON What would I want to say ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU It might come down to that after a while . SIMEON She can parlay a little French .  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her down in the desert with a canteen and a can of K rations ? She 's got no place to go . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Well , for God 's sake , where could you put her here ? I do n't know what you can do . Give her a hundred francs and tell her she 's on her own . SIMEON O.K. He turns . Who told you that about the girls ? p. 23 SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU God damn it  --  I read it ! If she 's Arab she 's circumcised . SIMEON That 's a funny custom . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU I 've heard of funnier .  --  That 's about enough about it . I 've got plenty to do , and so have you . SIMEON starts to exit between tents Left . Fill up the truck with sand , and then if you run over a mine maybe it wo n't kill you . I 've got to have you tonight .

Kapish ? p. 24 STEFANO Si , si , kapish  --  gracias ! He trots out right , smiling . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Who was on the phone ? MART Message from the old man . If Joslin does n't get back from Gafsa before ten you 're in charge of taking the company up . And about ten thousand orders and instructions about where and when everything goes . He hands notes to PETER . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants his breakfast hot now 's the time . WINKLE Starts off LeftI 'll do that . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Maybe I 'd better go along . What happened to the nurses that were going back ? WINKLE As they turn to goThey took the train this morning . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Heard from Wilmington lately , Winkle ? WINKLE She does n't write to me , Sarge . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Hell , she writes to you . You 'll get letters when the mail comes through . And if she did n't write , would that worry a soldier ? p. 25 WINKLE It sure worries me . PETER and WINKLE go out Left . An Australian nurse , LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY , comes in from between the tents Left , carrying a small travelling kit . She is weary and a bit bedraggled . She is followed almost immediately by an American nurse , LIEUTENANT KATHRYN BYRNE . LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY The AUSTRALIANDo you suppose anybody wants to see us , Sergeant ?

STEFANO goes out. p. 26 MART I gather you 're going up forward but you 'll have time for breakfast . LIEUTENANT KATHRYN BYRNE You do n't happen to have a tube of cold cream on you , Sergeant ? MART Huh ? LIEUTENANT KATHRYN BYRNE Lipstick ? MART Who , me ? LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY Do n't be offended . She asks everybody on the chance that some day somebody will have one . Come on , Kathy .

MART Who has gone to the teletype'Morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Badly . I could hear the cannon off in the mountains . MART Yes , I heard that . I guess the Jerries are trying to break through to the south . STEFANO re-enters with more cups . PETER comes back . MART Find the captain ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Yeah . He 'll be along . p. 27 LIEUTENANT DAMMARTIN That fellow waits on the table here ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU He enjoys it , sir . Prisoner of war . LIEUTENANT DAMMARTIN Personally , I do n't take prisoners . I say , let them die . All of them . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Well , that would simplify matters . LIEUTENANT DAMMARTIN It will simplify them . It will be done . Maybe not by you . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU I 'm fighting my own private war too . But I do n't include Stefano . STEFANO exits . LIEUTENANT DAMMARTIN What private war do you fight ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU My father was born in Czecho-Slovakia . LIEUTENANT DAMMARTIN I see . A war of the second generation . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Something like that . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He exits Right . KATHY enters from between the tents Left . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Hello , Kathy . LIEUTENANT KATHRYN BYRNE Damned if it is n't Sergeant Moldau. p. 28 SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU SalutingIf you want to be formal , Lieutenant Byrne . LIEUTENANT KATHRYN BYRNE SalutingI remember , Peter 's the name . How are you , Pete . Shaking hands SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Right . LIEUTENANT KATHRYN BYRNE You look unfamiliar without your crutch . How 's the leg ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Damn useful . Good as new . There 's another nurse with you ? LIEUTENANT KATHRYN BYRNE Yes . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Not Thomasina ? LIEUTENANT KATHRYN BYRNE Yes , your little Australian . We drove from Tozeur with an English officer . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU I 'll be damned . LIEUTENANT KATHRYN BYRNE She will , too . I 'm just getting something out of my kit . She starts out Left . Where 's Chellie these days ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU That 's right . You used to see Chellie in Constantine . LIEUTENANT KATHRYN BYRNE Is he here ? p. 29 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that same mine-field where I got this . He was a good guy . LIEUTENANT KATHRYN BYRNE Yeah , he sure was . She exits down Left . TICKER , an English corporal , enters from up left , carrying a large khaki bag and a folding armchair . CORPORAL TICKER Should I set them here ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU What are they ? CORPORAL TICKER They 're Captain Sutton 's . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Set them in the tent there , if you like . TICKER sits up the chair at the table takes the bag into the tent . TOMMY enters from between the tents Left . Hello , Tommy . LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY Peter . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Yes . LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY You 're walking around . TICKER comes out of tent and hurries off Left . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Thanks to you . LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY This is funny . Do you know where I 'm going ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU You 're one of the two they sent over to cadre some green American nurses . p. 30 LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY With your outfit ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I could have got out of this , too . They called for volunteers . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU You 're sorry you came ? LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY If I have any sense I am . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU I wo n't bother you . LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY No , I 'm sure you wo n't . Well  --  She turns . I must wash . We drove all night . No sleep . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Er She stops . Were you with the Eighth ? LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY For a few weeks . They needed everybody they could get . It 's better there now . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Going to get worse around here maybe . CAPTAIN SUTTON enters from between tents Left . LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY I do n't know . I just do as I 'm told . CAPTAIN SUTTON There you are , Tommy . LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY You 've met Captain Sutton ? p. 31 SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Just this moment . DAMMARTIN enters Right . KATHY enters Left with two towels . CAPTAIN SUTTON Yes . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU And this is Lieutenant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French . Captain Sutton , Lieutenant Grey and Lieutenant Byrne . CAPTAIN SUTTON Set down that plate and take a salute , Leftenant . We salute you all round . That was the longest march in military history . I congratulate everybody concerned . LIEUTENANT DAMMARTIN Thank you , sir . CAPTAIN SUTTON We 're thanking you for being here . LIEUTENANT KATHRYN BYRNE I found the towels , Tommy . And they 're ours . There 's no mistaking that Bengazi smell . LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY Excuse us , please . LIEUTENANT KATHRYN BYRNE To DammartinYou do n't happen to have a tube of cold cream or a lipstick ? LIEUTENANT DAMMARTIN Unfortunately , no . LIEUTENANT KATHRYN BYRNE I just keep asking . TOMMY and KATHY go out between tents Left. p. 32 CAPTAIN SUTTON Do n't stand on ceremony , Leftenant , eat your breakfast . LIEUTENANT DAMMARTIN Thank you , sir . Crosses Left to cot , and eats . CAPTAIN SUTTON I 'm reporting for liaison duty from the British Eighth . Where is the company C.P. ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU This is it , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Captain Johnson is at Kebili  --  asked me to apologize for him , and one of our lieutenants is up near the line with supplies and one 's in the rear bringing up the mail . Matter of fact , I 've had word I may have to take the company forward tonight . CAPTAIN SUTTON You 're in command here now ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU At the moment . CAPTAIN SUTTON Hell , I seem to be reporting to you , Sergeant . They salute . I 've heard it said the English are n't adjustable , but I 'm learning to adjust damn fast . MART enters from between tents Right . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU I 'd better explain , sir , that when the officers are all away , I usually eat here at the captain 's table . The breakfast has just been dished out  --  or , if you 'd rather take over the table  --  p. 33 CAPTAIN SUTTON Not at all  --  invitation accepted . Ticker ! CORPORAL TICKER Yes , sir . Enters CAPTAIN SUTTON You 'd better move the car around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll take it apart if it stays there . CORPORAL TICKER I 'll watch it , sir . CAPTAIN SUTTON No , do n't watch it . Bring it around . And find something to eat and then get started on these slit trenches . I 'm gunshy and I want my burrow quick and I want it handy . Where can I have it dug ? MART and PETER exchange glances . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU I beg pardon , sir , the slit trenches are behind this tent , but we have a company regulation that every man and officer digs his own . CAPTAIN SUTTON Well , I 'll be a son-of-a-bitch . Who made that regulation ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Captain Johnson , sir . CAPTAIN SUTTON Do n't get the impression I could n't dig my own if I had to . I 've done it . But I have other things on my mind this morning , and I intend to have a slit trench at once and I 'm not going to dig it personally . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU The regulation exists , sir , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . p. 34 CAPTAIN SUTTON What happens to me if Ticker does my excavating ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU I could n't say , sir . CAPTAIN SUTTON Ticker , you will bring the entrenching tools and set to work . CORPORAL TICKER Yes , sir . He salutes and exits Left . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU You wo n't really need one of your own . The officers dug theirs right here behind the tent and you can use any one of them . CAPTAIN SUTTON I 'd rather have my own , if you do n't mind . I 've tried jumping in with friends , and it often leaves the rear exposed . I 'll be court-martialed , naturally , and thrown out of the mucking army for disobeying rules , but the trial will be damned amusing . Damned amusing people , you Americans , anyway . That regulation , for example . Your captain was n't joking , by any chance ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU No. sir , He was quite serious . CAPTAIN SUTTON Yes , he would be . You 're a very serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , is not a democratic institution , no matter what you do with it . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU You 're telling me sir ! CAPTAIN SUTTON When do we get strafed here ? p. 35 SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Any time . CAPTAIN SUTTON It could come during breakfast ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU It certainly could . From over that line of hills . CAPTAIN SUTTON I 'll just take a look at the trenches . He walks up between tents Left . They look good and deep . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU They are . We 've been strafed pretty hard . MART Hey , Sarge . He brings PETER a small hand-book and crosses to phone . CAPTAIN SUTTON Coming backForgive me , but I have a prying nature , and I 'm a bit farsighted . That 's one of your hand-books , is n't it ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Yes , sir . CAPTAIN SUTTON Is it , by any chance , a disquisition on Anglo-American relations ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU It 's a little number on " How To Get Along With the English . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . CAPTAIN SUTTON How to get along with the English . He 's late with it , is n't he ? TICKER arrives with the entrenching tools. p. 36 CAPTAIN SUTTON Ticker , are my pistols loaded ? CORPORAL TICKER Yes , sir . Your gear 's in the tent , sir . CAPTAIN SUTTON Bring me the Book of Common Prayer and my pistols . This is getting to be a situation . CORPORAL TICKER Yes , sir . CAPTAIN SUTTON You 'll find the prayer book in the map case . CORPORAL TICKER I know , sir . He goes into tent . CAPTAIN SUTTON I read a little squib the other day about the first meeting of American and English soldiers in Africa . One of them , according to the story said , " Hi , Yank . " The other said , " Hi , Limey , " and they sat down to share their rations . But if you have a handbook , I 'll have a handbook . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU That 's only fair , sir . CAPTAIN SUTTON I hope you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm a retired steel worker that met up with a couple of slugs crossing a mine-field . You appear to be wounded yourself . CAPTAIN SUTTON Bitten , Sergeant . Bitten by parasites . And we ran out of sulfa where I was . No , I 'm no hero . But I 'm covered with desert sores and I itch . p. 37 LIEUTENANT DAMMARTIN You came along the coast with the Eighth , sir ? CAPTAIN SUTTON Right . Before that I was at Freetown . Before that I was  --  at Dunkirk , for instance . I 've soldiered all over Europe and Africa  --  with stubborn Yorkshiremen and cursing New Zealanders and dour Scotsmen and the singing Welsh and the mucking Canadians . And just when I begin to know what to expect from all those quaint specimens , they send me here to take orders from an American sergeant who acquired most of his military experience on a drill-field in  --  New Jersey ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Pennsylvania . CAPTAIN SUTTON Pennsylvania . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU And I 'm not giving you any orders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pistols . Ah , now we 're on even terms . You look up answers on your manual and I 'll look up answers in the Anglican Book of Common Prayer . We can eat breakfast with our reference books on the table ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU It looks as if I was going to need mine . CAPTAIN SUTTON I 'm going to need mine  --  we 'll keep the pistols in reserve , Ticker . Phone rings. p. 38 MART Sycamore ! CAPTAIN SUTTON I forgot to ask if I could have a bath . How 's the water situation ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Yesterday we brought in a new water-point , a regular gusher , and we 're dishing out a gallon to a man . CAPTAIN SUTTON Do I have to return it ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Return what ? CAPTAIN SUTTON The water . Back with the Eighth each soldier used to get a pint , but it was only a loan . You had to turn it in to the supply sergeant . He filled radiators with it . Or somebody used it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad here yet . CAPTAIN SUTTON You 're lucky . Exits into tent . MART Hey , Peter , Simeon wants to talk to you . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU What about ? MART He says he knows a couple of Arab sheiks that want telephones installed in their tents . One lives at Maknassy  --  or not far from here  --  and one at Sened . They want telephones so they can order groceries , Simeon says . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Who has gone to the phoneLook , Simeon , you 'd better come home and give yourself up . You 've finally gone crazy . Hello ! He hung up on me . What did he say to you ? p. 39 MART Said he was discontented in the army and we did n't appreciate him . Thought he 'd go into the business of supplying telephones to his wife 's relatives . Is Simeon married ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU He 's involved . I ought to send somebody after him  --  but I would n't know where to send . Hell , he always took care of himself before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What do you mean involved ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU If I told you about him , I 'd have to tell him about you . MART comes back to phone . No , I 'm just the father confessor around here . A number of NATIVE WOMEN cross from Right to Left . CAPTAIN SUTTON returns from the tent . CAPTAIN SUTTON Hope you 'll excuse this filth I 'm wearing . Have n't had time to change clothes or bandages . He sits . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU I used to bathe every day before I came to Africa . Down here a fellow gets discouraged . CAPTAIN SUTTON For one thing the doctors do n't believe in it . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU That 's right . In the winter they used to say the natural oils kept the wool lively in your underwear . p. 40 CAPTAIN SUTTON My underwear got damn lively from time to time . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Think we ought to wait for the girls while the stuff cools off ? CAPTAIN SUTTON Give ' em rope . White women are scarce . You 've met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Constantine . I got this since then . I 'm supposed to take this sling off after the doctor looks at it , but the doctor never shows up . CAPTAIN SUTTON How are we going to work this business out  --  going up forward ? You 're liaison here , Leftenant ? LIEUTENANT DAMMARTIN For the Fighting French , yes . CAPTAIN SUTTON And I 'm liaison . That means we 're both staff , and the Sergeant 's the O.C. and that 's something new in the history of warfare . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU It 's temporary . CAPTAIN SUTTON You give orders and we give advice . Correct ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU I guess that 's the way it has to be . CAPTAIN SUTTON Your company is at the extreme right wing of the Americans ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Yes . SUTTON looks at the map. p. 41 CAPTAIN SUTTON You 're to move up to this ridge , as I understand it , and extend to this valley , just out of Kebili . The French are to dig in on your right  --  right here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . CAPTAIN SUTTON From there on the English take over all the way to the coast . The French and the Americans are supposed to hold the Germans where they are while the English smash them . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU I was n't told that . LIEUTENANT DAMMARTIN Nor was I. CAPTAIN SUTTON Well , I was . I got it , strangely enough , from head-quarters . Of course , the C.G. is an American , but he makes a lot of sense . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Oh , some of the English talk sense  --  I 've noticed it . CAPTAIN SUTTON Thanks . A flight of planes is heard approaching . MART , DAMMARTIN and the CAPTAIN are on their feet instantly , the CAPTAIN diving for the rear . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Looking upIt 's all right . P-40 's . CAPTAIN SUTTON Have n't heard many P-40 's . And I 've got the jitters about planes overhead . DAMMARTIN exits between tents Right. p. 42 SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU So have I. We 've lost a lot of good men that way . Just did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came over . So I jump . TOMMY and KATHY enter from between tents Left . CAPTAIN SUTTON God , they look cheerful ! LIEUTENANT KATHRYN BYRNE Are we late ? CAPTAIN SUTTON The food 's cold . Not that it matters with guck like this . They sit at the table . LIEUTENANT KATHRYN BYRNE This place is positively lavish with water , and we had n't had our clothes off for a good week  --  so we pooled our rations , and poured the stuff over each other . CAPTAIN SUTTON A blissful picture . LIEUTENANT KATHRYN BYRNE It felt blissful . Cold water running right down the middle of your back . Imagine . CAPTAIN SUTTON I am imagining . LIEUTENANT KATHRYN BYRNE Think about the water , Captain . Water is really scarce . CAPTAIN SUTTON Not as scarce as beautiful white women pouring water over each other in the middle of Tunisia . LIEUTENANT KATHRYN BYRNE Is he always like that ? p. 43 LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY He has a dirty mind , I guess . Good , clean dirt , though . CAPTAIN SUTTON Would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ educated to be a priest in the church of England ? The answer is no . Nobody . LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY When do we leave this place ? CAPTAIN SUTTON That 's military information . Eat your G.I. breakfast . The truth is I can leave as soon as I 've got in touch with my colonel . He 's at Sened . Have you got wire to Sened ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU It was cut last night . We sent a man out on it , but he may have gone crazy , judging by a telephone call we had from him . CAPTAIN SUTTON I might have to drive to Sened , then . How far is it ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Not far . But there 's no road . Just trails . MART Mostly full of mud . You 'd better wait  --  and see if the line 's fixed . CAPTAIN SUTTON I could wait ,  --  and have a bath . Any volunteers to pour water over an aging English captain , covered with festering sores and very dirty ? Do I hear huzzas ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BYRNE No , but I will change those stinking bandages of yours . p. 44 SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Maybe I could interest a competent nurse in deciding whether I can take this sling off ? LIEUTENANT KATHRYN BYRNE They do n't allow me to decide things like that yet . Tommy would know . Phone rings . MART answers . LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY I doubt it . MART Sycamore . Well , at the moment we do n't know whether we 're front or rear . O.K. , we 're rear .  --  Today ?  --  You 're sure you mean today ? On what hill ? He writes . Djeladin Djebel Djeladin . Over ? Yes , that certainly is enough . Roger tarfu . He hangs up . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Now what ? MART The radar will be here this morning  --  it 's coming on the train  --  and Corps Headquarters wants it set on Djebel Djeladin . That 's a hill . CAPTAIN SUTTON It is indeed a hill . MART Corps Headquarters wants it up there , and working , today . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's the highest peak on the ridge . How do you get sixteen hundred pounds up there ? p. 45 MART It comes apart in four sections . About four hundred pounds each . CAPTAIN SUTTON And no road ! Who 's going to carry four hundred pounds up a mountain ? The phone rings again . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Damn that phone ! Every time it rings it means more trouble . MART At the phoneSycamore rear . What ? Wait a minute ! Wait a minute ! Do n't hang up . PETER rises . Simeon says the Sened wire is in . PETER crosses to phone . Hey , Peter wants to talk to you . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Look , Simeon , every time I think the war is lost and everybody 's gone crazy you fix something  --  and we can go on for a few minutes . A miracle man . That 's all right . I do n't mean it . I just want to get you to do something else .  --  I want you to set the radar on a hill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I do n't know . I do n't know . I do n't know . The radar will be here as soon as you are and the hill is on the map . Over . What ? Same to you , boy , same to you . He hangs up . MART Pete , could you watch the phone while I get chow ? p. 46 SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Sure . MART goes out Right . CAPTAIN SUTTON Did you mean it about those bandages ? LIEUTENANT KATHRYN BYRNE If I can find the gauze . Shall I have a look ? CAPTAIN SUTTON Would you ? I can put them on myself . STEFANO enters to clear the table . LIEUTENANT KATHRYN BYRNE No reason why you should . She goes out between tents Left . CAPTAIN SUTTON Crosses to PETER at phoneHow do I get Sened ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Pick up the receiver , ring , and ask for Eucalyptus rear . CAPTAIN SUTTON At phoneEucalyptus rear . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Is it working ? CAPTAIN SUTTON Seems to be . Hello . Eucalyptus ? Yes  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to talk to Colonel Sneath . STEFANO exits . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Would you really know whether I could get rid of this sling ? p. 47 LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY I guess so . Sit down . She goes toward him . He loosens his shirt . I guess you 'd better take it off . He does so . She looks at the bandages and rips an adhesive loose with professional precision . CAPTAIN SUTTON At the phoneColonel Sneath ? I 'm just outside Maknassy . Sir ?  --  Yes sir . Takes paper and pencil and makes notes . LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY You 'll have to wear the bandage for a few days yet . I think you can dispense with the sling if it 's not too painful to move your shoulder . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Not very . LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY Do n't put too much weight on it . I 'll tape the bandage down again . She takes an adhesive roll and a pair of scissors from her kit and fits adhesive to the bandage . CAPTAIN SUTTON Righto . Over . LIEUTENANT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tape over the shoulder . She continues bandaging . CAPTAIN SUTTON Starts out , stops , turnsTommy , will you do me next if you have time ? p. 48 LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY Sure . SUTTON exits between tents Left . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU That 's the first British officer I 've seen . Are they all like that ? LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY No.  --  He 's a lord . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU A what ? LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY He 's Captain Sutton down here , but in England he 's Lord Sutton , Marquis of Something . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU I thought he was educated to be a preacher . LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY Maybe he 's a younger son ; anyway he came into the estate and the title . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Pretty soft . LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY He does n't think so . Says it 's damned expensive . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Is that why I never heard from you ? LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY Is what why ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU You know what I mean . LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY He 's in love with me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says so . PauseDid you expect to hear from me ? p. 49 SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Yes . LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY Finishes bandagingI told you you would n't . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU TOMMY helps him on with his field jacket . Look now , Tommy . Just about the time I found out I was n't going to be a cripple , and you were teaching me to walk in the evenings , and I began to think if the war would let us alone what a wonderful world it would be , you checked out of Constantine and I never knew why you went or where . LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY And you never guessed ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU This is a big place , North Africa . Jesus , I wish you 'd said something before you picked up and went away . Sometimes you say what you think and you have a little quarrel and then you go along all right . LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY I did n't want to go along . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Or if you had a previous engagement  --  or somebody was waiting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Then , for God 's sake , what was going on behind that funny face of yours ? p. 50 LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY You were n't really in love with me , Peter , and I wanted you to love me . Only you did n't . So I got out of there . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU I did love you . But if you 're in a war you 're married to the war . You ca n't promise anything , not if you 're honest . Because you never know where you 're going to be , or how long you 'll be gone , or whether you 'll come back , and you have n't got a thing in the world except what 's in your pack and what you get at the end of the month . You do n't belong to yourself and you do n't know about tomorrow . That goes for men and for women too . LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY I know . And there are a lot of girls who get to be  --  part of the army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And then he 's killed . And there 's another . And pretty soon they do n't expect anybody to come back and it does n't matter so much who it is . And that happened to me . I 'd been in love with a boy in Australia , and he was killed . There was a lieutenant here in North Africa . I was in love with him , just for a week . And he was killed .  --  I did n't want to love any more . He 'd be killed . So I went with the others , from one hospital to another , and the wounded poured in  --  and nothing mattered except that men had such a little time to live .  --  But I 'm not like that . I know I 'm not . I 'm not made that way . It 's all wrong for me . I want  --  p. 51 SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU What Tommy ? LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY Something to hold to . So everything wo n't be swept away and lost .  --  Everything goes by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm lost . And there 's nothing to believe , and nobody to believe . And it wo n't stop  --  forever . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Do you think it would do any good for two people to stand up before somebody and have words said over them ? Would things last any longer ? LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY They might . Never mind . It was just my bad luck we happened to stop here . I should n't have said anything . I never meant to see you again . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU What good did it do to leave me and take up with somebody else ? LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY He does n't matter . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Goes to her You certainly matter to me , so for God 's sake , Tommy  --  He puts his arm around her . LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY Pushing him awayNo ! No ! No ! Oh , darling , I 'm sorry ! I forgot ! SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Why not , Tommy ? p. 52 LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY Because  --  with you  --  it had to be more than that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I meant  --  never to see you again  --  SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU How was I to know ? LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY You know . They break . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Does Sutton want you to marry him ? LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY There 's a Lady Sutton . He 's just lost . Even more lost than I am  --  so he hangs on to me . It was just bad luck  --  stopping here . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU The hell of it is I feel the same damn way about you  --  only  --  LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY No.  --  Do n't try to fix it up . It ca n't be fixed . And why should it be ? What 's it all good for , anyway ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU No , I mean it . I 'm not much to talk about it , Tommy , but it 's true  --  only  --  LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY Only what ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Only you 're looking for something that 'll last forever  --  and things do n't last forever in this war , you know that . p. 53 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes in from between tents Left with a bundle of bandages . LIEUTENANT KATHRYN BYRNE Has his lordship emerged from the tub ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU No  --  he 's a thorough man , I imagine . LIEUTENANT KATHRYN BYRNE They 've got everything packed to go . I had a devil of a time getting this stuff . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU It probably never got unpacked . SUTTON comes from between tents Left in a bathrobe . CAPTAIN SUTTON That was like the pool of Bethesda . I 'm a new man . Where 's the angel that promised to trouble the waters ? LIEUTENANT KATHRYN BYRNE I 've just managed to break these out . CAPTAIN SUTTON Shall I sit here and stick out one limb at a time , or do we need privacy ? Sound of a camel caravan approaching LIEUTENANT KATHRYN BYRNE I can work here . SUTTON sits on cot and puts out a scarred leg for her to bandage . She goes to work . Several NATIVE WOMEN appear Left , watching curiously. p. 54 SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU If you want privacy , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a crowd gathering . MART enters from between tents Right . DOUGIE enters from Right . MART It 's a caravan arriving . LIEUTENANT KATHRYN BYRNE Looking upCamels  --  donkeys  --  I 've never seen so many camels in a town before . The confused distant noise of men calling to their charges can be heard . WINKLE enters from between tents Left . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU What 's cooking ? WINKLE Looks like a muckin ' army . DOUGIE and WINKLE go on through to the Left . ARABS are heard shouting to the animals . ARABS Musakh bagra ! Burra ! Burra ! Kalb ! Gideem huwaish ! Akhad kalb ! Intoom mush bahee haiyawaan ! Kalb ! Burra ! Burra ! Burra ! MART Look  --  they 're barging right through here . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Tell ' em they ca n't come this way . MART runs out Left . DOUGIE enters . DOUGIE Hey , Pete  --  it 's Simeon . p. 55 SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU What ? Who ? DOUGIE It 's Simeon . He 's riding on a camel . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty camel drivers  --  SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Well , keep ' em out of here . They ca n't come through this way . DOUGIE You ca n't come through here  --  you 'll have to go around  --  SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Allez ! Allez ! You ca n't come this way ! DOUGIE Allez ! Allez ! Get the hell out ! SIMEON Enters LeftPeter , my boy , come to papa 's arms , kiss me , Chooley Macalley , I 'm an Arab , I 've got everything fixed for the army  --  we 're all set and moisenflay  --  SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU What the hell have you done now ? SIMEON Is the Sened wire working ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Yes . SIMEON Who fixed it ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU I got the impression you did . SIMEON That 's what I 'm telling you ! I can do anything ! I 've got a formula ! It 's magic ! p. 56 SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Hashish is the same as marihuana , you know . SIMEON Do you want to know how I fixed the Sened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was Arabs cut the wire , and when I told Mabroukha about it she said , " Let me talk to the Sheik . " SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Who 's Mabroukha ? SIMEON The girl . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU I see . SIMEON She talked to the Sheik for me and she found out he was miramar about telephones . All his life he 'd heard about telephones and he thought if you had a telephone you were really globiosus . So every once in a while he stole one of ours , but he could n't make it work . He wanted a telephone so he could talk to his cousin , who is a Sheik at Sened . So we hooked telephones on for him and his cousin , and they 're probably sitting over there now , spilling each other the Chooley Macalley over the phone . We 're hooked into the same wire on another circuit and now we 've got wire to Sened . What 's more it ca n't be cut without cutting the Sheik 's communications , and he 'll have the living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's burmashawm now ? Does that sound like hep ? p. 57 CAPTAIN SUTTON Who has come round to look at SIMEONWhat language does this man talk ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU It 's code . He 's signal corps . SIMEON salutes . CAPTAIN SUTTON Returning saluteI see . It bothered me because sometimes I seemed to understand it . LIEUTENANT KATHRYN BYRNE Give me your hoof and stay out of this . SUTTON returns to KATHY and the bandaging . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU O.K. , Simeon , you got the wire in to Sened , and you gave the Arabs a vested interest in it so it wo n't be cut  --  and that 's all to the good . But what in hell are you doing here with fifty camels ? SIMEON Twenty-seven , Peter , that 's all . Why , I asked my good friend , Sheik Kalipha , how could I have a radar up on a mountain with no roads . And we sat there eating cous-cous for a while and finally he said why yes , it could be done with camels . Se @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rode on one . Some time I want to talk to you , Peter , about the noises made by camels . A camel is a bad case of indigestion which walks around and you sit on it . It 's like a travelling volcano in eruption , with a stink like H2s . It 's disgusting  --  But I can get the radar up Djebel Djeladin with ' em , and so they 're out there with their wally wampus in the middle and the safety valves blowing off at both ends .  --  And when you get the radar up , who 's the Number One boy that did it  --  why , the same kid that got wire to Sened  --  p. 58 SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Simeon , the magician  --  SIMEON No.  --  Mabroukha . It was her idea . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Oh , it was her idea . SIMEON Well , it was my idea to give ' em telephones , but it was her idea to talk to ' em . She said , Look  --  only it was in French  --  Voila , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but you should n't shoot them ; you should arrange matters . This is their country you fight over . They steal from you because they are hungry and you are rich and you are here without permission . That 's a rough translation . Fact is , she 'd been stealing from the U.S. Army herself ; she had two cans of C rations and a can of coffee under her shawl when I bought her . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Stolen rations ? SIMEON She returned ' em to the army . I was hungry . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU I see . SIMEON So I said , I do n't talk Arabic , and she said , Let me try . And she moisenflayed with the Sheik , and that fixed the business . Now she 's our liaison with the Arabs  --  and those Arabs  --  they 're the pay-off  --  they 're the miffdown , they make all the difference  --  SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Yeah , maybe so . But there 's no provision in the field manual for soldiers owning girls . p. 59 SIMEON You need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have Mabroukha and the service of supply was snafu . Today she 's on our side and it all gets ironed out . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Look  --  maybe she 'd be useful to the army , but no soldier can take a woman along , you know that . Where is she ? SIMEON Out there holding the camel drivers together . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU What do you want me to do ? SIMEON You 've got to see her , Chooley Macalley . I told her you had to decide and she 's all ready to come in and talk to you . I 'll tell her you 're here  --  He starts off . DAMMARTIN enters from between tents Right . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU I ca n't decide anything  --  it 's all down in the army regulations . SIMEON Do you want that radar on the mountain , big boy , or not ?  --  Mabroukha ! Entrez-vous . Pause . MABROUKHA comes in Left , wearing a yakmish and native dress . She looks round timidly at the assembly , then turns to run out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , non , Mabroukha  --  vous avez parle  --  parle le piece d'occasion  --  p. 60 MABROUKHA Non , non  --  s'il vous plais  --  non , non  --  SIMEON Voila ! MABROUKHA C'est l'homme ? SIMEON Aywa ! MABROUKHA Le grand pere blanc ? SIMEON Oui , oui . Aywa . The great white father . MABROUKHA Crossing to PETERSa  --  e  --  da , effendi . SIMEON Say , Lieutenant , can you moisenflay Arab ? LIEUTENANT DAMMARTIN I speak one or two dialects . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Would you help us out here ? LIEUTENANT DAMMARTIN Coming forwardSurely . I-da nak-der , a-na nfa-rej lik . MABROUKHA Llah jee-ja-zeek eb-Khayr , tab-ghee nab-da ? El-likaya . LIEUTENANT DAMMARTIN Aywa . MABROUKHA Ra-nee gha-dee nab-da el-hi-ka-ya em-ta-ee LIEUTENANT DAMMARTIN This , she says , is her story . He bows slightly. p. 61 MABROUKHA Dirt ha-ja Kha-ye-ba m-ha wa-hid ar-ra-jil fee dar am-mee . LIEUTENANT DAMMARTIN She was , shall we say , indiscreet with a young gentleman of her acquaintance . He bows . She continues . MABROUKHA OO lazim a-lay-ya es-jin fee Kasbah . LIEUTENANT DAMMARTIN For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the tribal authorities , to the Kasbah . The Kasbah , in case you are unfamiliar , is the house of corruption , and a girl who is sent there must remain till she earns her way out . He bows to MABROUKHA again . She proceeds . MABROUKHA Balk me be-ghayt ne-rooh les-jin , ha-rabt bel-hag . LIEUTENANT DAMMARTIN Now Mabroukha , how shall I say , she had taken her pleasure with one young man , but that did not mean that she wished to take on mankind in general . Therefore she ran away . He bows . MABROUKHA Kem-sho-nee i-a-doo oo ba-oo-nee . TOMMY enters from between tents Left . LIEUTENANT DAMMARTIN She was seized by strangers . p. 62 MABROUKHA Bel-hag , bez-har en-ba-et el wa-hid Sergeant al-li Ka nab-ghi oo n-hab nakh-dmo dee-ma . LIEUTENANT DAMMARTIN She was sold , fortunately , to Sergeant Simeon here . She loves him and is extravagantly happy to be his . She comes forward , kneels , and kisses PETER 'S hand . MABROUKHA Armil Maroof . LIEUTENANT DAMMARTIN And now she prays you on her knees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , no ! Tell her to get up . We do n't do that here . LIEUTENANT DAMMARTIN La , la , la ! Moosh heena . She rises and crosses to SIMEON . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Look , Simeon . I guess you win . Speaking for the army I have to say stay away from native women or I 'll restrict you to quarters . Officially if I catch you with Mabroukha again I 'll have to put you under arrest . On the other hand you 're in charge of signal installation . If you need cooperation from the natives you have to manage that for yourself . If Mabroukha rode a camel as far as Djebel Djeladin I would n't know her from any other camel driver .  --  What does she look like ? Is she going to take off that domino ? Starts crossing toward MABROUKHA p. 63 SIMEON Uh-uh ! Us Arabs , we do n't allow any monkey business with our women . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Then you can get the hell out , you Arabs , and hamdulala to both of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It looks as if you 're doing pretty well , Simeon . It 's a little like buying a pig in a poke , but judging by what I can see she 's all right . SIMEON Stay away from my girl , Sarge . If you want one you go and buy a Hedy Lamar of your own .  --  Matter of fact , Peter , much obliged . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Glad to do it . Drop in any time . No trouble at all . SIMEON Come on , Chooley Macalley ! SIMEON and MABROUKHA exit Left . LIEUTENANT KATHRYN BYRNE And that finishes you , too , you whited sepulchre . Get up and see if you can walk . The CAPTAIN rises , feeling his new bandages . SIMEON is heard calling outside . SIMEON Come on , come on , get a move on you , guts  --  come on , moisenflay , come on , Chooley Macalley ! Get started ! The calls of the camel drivers begin again and gradually melt away . Drivers . Musakh bagra ! Burra ! Burra ! Burra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Burra ! TOMMY crosses to table and sits. p. 64 CAPTAIN SUTTON Well , Tommy , I 'll get my clothes and we can start . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU There 's no reason why you and Tommy and Kathy and Ticker should all crowd into that one jeep with baggage and equipment , you know . There are other modes of travel . CAPTAIN SUTTON For example ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Well , there 's a native train . And there 'll be a hell of a lot of carriers going forward . I 'm taking the Captain 's station wagon . LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY Would there be space on the train ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU We 'd clear a space . LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY I think I 'd like to try it . CAPTAIN SUTTON And if there 's no place on the train then of course she could travel with you . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU I would n't object . CAPTAIN SUTTON I think possibly I would . In this man 's army you leave your girl for a few minutes and when you come back she 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my dear . CAPTAIN SUTTON Pardon me , busy . When does the next train leave ? p. 65 SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU There 's no schedule . CAPTAIN SUTTON Shedule . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU There 's no shedule either . The trains run irregularly to take up supplies . CAPTAIN SUTTON That 's what I thought . There 's no telling when they 'd arrive . LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY Does it matter ? CAPTAIN SUTTON You 'll be setting up a new medical station . Kathy here has n't had the experience , and anyway it would take the two of you . You 'll have no transport from the train to where you 're going , and you need every moment there is . LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY I 'll manage . I always have . CAPTAIN SUTTON If you do n't come with me the station wo n't be open for business tonight , and the wounded might begin coming in . The Sergeant will tell you the same thing . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU I 'd just as soon you did n't ride with him . I 'd rather you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be honest , the train would probably get you there toward evening . I 'll be starting around noon . CAPTAIN SUTTON And you wo n't beat the train much , either . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Possibly not . p. 66 CAPTAIN SUTTON Quite aside from my personal interest in the matter , I do n't think she ought to be late . LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY I 'm sick of setting up stations  --  I 'm sick of being on time ! I 'm sick of the whole war ! I do n't think it matters if I 'm late ! CAPTAIN SUTTON Tommy , I happen to know the place . You 'll be taking over an old wreck of a building the Germans used as a field hospital and just evacuated . It 's filthy from end to end  --  bloody mattresses and stale bandages lying around . You ought to get there as soon as possible . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU I guess it does matter , Tommy . I do n't like to let you go , but if that 's true we 'd be taking a chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong . LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY Well  --  maybe I 've set up so many stations it no longer seems worth-while . But  --  we 'll start right away . CAPTAIN SUTTON Ready in three minutes . Calling offTicker ! Exits between tents Right . MART Hey , Peter . Enters Left . Can you take a look ? There 's some Ayrabs unloading canned stuff and every once in a while they smash a crate just so they can steal it . Two ARAB WOMEN cross from Right to Left. p. 67 SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU You 're grown up , take care of it . MART exits Left . The MUEZZIN is heard chanting off Right . LIEUTENANT KATHRYN BYRNE We 'd better pack . I undid both bedding rolls looking for tape . KATHY and TOMMY start out Left . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Meeting TOMMY as she passes him and putting his hands on her shoulders . So long , Tommy . He kisses her . She makes no response . See you at Mezzouna . LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY It wo n't do any good . Nothing will do any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her@@ SCENE : The same tent , flanked as before with neighbor tents Left and Right , but pitched now against the steep side of a rocky desert hill . It 's a week later . About three o'clock in the afternoon . MART is talking over the phone , now down Right . The table Left Center , and a cot perpendicular to the Right of the center tent . SUTTON 'S chair is in the tent entrance to the Left of the cot . MART We 've been here a week now , and we 've stood only one pretty tough counter-attack , the second night we were here . Casualties light among the men , but we certainly had bad luck with officers . That 's right .  --  Captain Johnson 's mortar squad was wiped out by a shell , all except the Captain himself , who was wounded . Griffin was hurt the next day in the mine field , I told you about . Peter 's running the company again . Captain Johnson is still in the field hospital here . Griffin was sent back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet . We 're about three jumps beyond snafu but we have n't really got to tarfu . Sopafu comes pretty close to it . Look , Kelly , it goes this way . Snafu . S.N.A.F.U. , Situation normal  --  all mucked up . Then Sopafu . S.O.P.A.F.U. , Standard Operating Procedure , All Mucked Up ; and finally you get to Fubar . F.U.B.A.R. Mucked up beyond all recognition . That 's as far as you go , even in the Army . What ? Sure , I can spell , but did you ever happen to see the sign posted here by our C.O. ? The sign says : " Officers and men reporting over this telephone will refrain , in the interests of brevity , from all words ending in it , itch , uck and astard . " Thanks . Roger Sopafu . He hangs up . The teletype starts clicking . He crosses to it . KATHY and MABROUKHA enter from Right carrying piles of towels and pillow cases . Oh , Miss Byrne , there 's a package for you at the number one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plasma you were waiting for . Here 's the chit for it . p. 69 LIEUTENANT KATHRYN BYRNE Thanks , Mart . She takes the chit . Tommy 's waiting for this , so I 'd better go back . MABROUKHA Looking at the chitPour l'hopital ? Teletype stops . MART tears out sheet , crosses to table and sits , decoding message . LIEUTENANT KATHRYN BYRNE Oui . MABROUKHA Estana henna . She takes the chit . LIEUTENANT KATHRYN BYRNE It 's heavy . PantomimesRi-zeen . MABROUKHA Non , non . She puts down the linen and exits Right . KATHY sinks on the cot . TOMMY enters from between tents Left . LIEUTENANT KATHRYN BYRNE You 're hurrying again , darling . Remember what the doctor said about this climate . LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY We 're out of plasma  --  right down to the bottom  --  and I have three more injections to give before dinner . LIEUTENANT KATHRYN BYRNE It seems to be at the dump . Mabroukha 's gone back to get it . p. 70 LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY Can she carry it ? LIEUTENANT KATHRYN BYRNE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can take the weight off your arches for a minute . You did n't lie down at all last night . LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY I was asleep for a while . She sits on SUTTON 'S chair . LIEUTENANT KATHRYN BYRNE When ? LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY I sat down to have a cup of tea about five and the strafing woke me  --  I must have been out a couple of hours . LIEUTENANT KATHRYN BYRNE I slept right through the strafing . LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY So did Captain Johnson . I looked in and he was sound asleep . LIEUTENANT KATHRYN BYRNE Is he going to come out of this ? LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY Oh , yes . If he gets enough plasma . That stuff 's really astonishing . A man can be dying , and you pump him full of plasma , and three minutes later he 'll sit up and ask for a cigarette . It gives you a strange feeling about life and death . It 's such a tiny step , one way or the other . A sentry ( WINKLE ) crosses Right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hylas used to say : " What 's a man , anyway ? Just a sack of blood . Fill him up and he 's fine . Empty him out and he crumples . " LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY I have a lot of respect for men , though . They believe in things , and they go right out and get killed for what they believe . I do n't think I could do that . LIEUTENANT KATHRYN BYRNE You could be killed here , too , you know . LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY It 's not the same .  --  I 'm getting to be a terrible coward about the strafing . Every time there 's a plane overhead  --  just any plane  --  even one of our own  --  I have to hold myself like iron or I 'd drop the needle or the tray , or whatever 's in my hands , and race for a slit trench and burrow down . LIEUTENANT KATHRYN BYRNE Captain Sutton feels the same way . LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY There 's excuse for him . He 's seen so much of it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BYRNE By the way , what with propinquity and all I 'm more and more fascinated by the English aristocracy . LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY Any luck ? LIEUTENANT KATHRYN BYRNE I gather he just ca n't forget you . p. 72 LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY Give him a few days more . He 's exceptionally constant . SIMEON comes in from the Right , followed by MABROUKHA , who carries a large package on her head . LIEUTENANT KATHRYN BYRNE Shame on you , Simeon , walking seven feet in front of your woman , like an Arab , and making her carry that stuff . SIMEON Look , Lieutenant Byrne , you been noticing me , all subdued and quiet , and ca n't think of any new words ? LIEUTENANT KATHRYN BYRNE You 're not quite as fledderis as you used to be , Simeon . You stay more on the trax wax . SIMEON Well , I found out something about these native customs . Do you know why the man walks in front ? LIEUTENANT KATHRYN BYRNE To show disrespect to the female behind him . SIMEON No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . And do you know why she carries the bundles ? LIEUTENANT KATHRYN BYRNE Because she 's the beast of burden , and he 's the master . SIMEON No . She do n't trust him with anything valuable . MABROUKHA Doogbree fissa ! Vite ! Vite ! SIMEON You hear that ? Straight ahead ! Hurry ! He picks up her yakmish to kiss her . A la fum ! She lifts her face and he kisses her on the mouth . That puts her in her place . He replaces her yakmish . You ought to see her some time . She 's the real three-ply madrasca. p. 73 MABROUKHA Vite ! SIMEON You go ahead . He points  --  then takes her shoulders and tries to start her . Bil-laa-hee . MABROUKHA Non , non . Lak ! Vite ! Zhi-mal ! SIMEON That means camel . Now I 'm the camel , see , and she 's the camel-driver . They exit between tents Left . LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY This camel has to move , too . LIEUTENANT KATHRYN BYRNE Ca n't I take care of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kathy ? LIEUTENANT KATHRYN BYRNE . Picking up the linenI 'm sure I could . LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY Because now I 'm down I do n't seem to be able to get up again . LIEUTENANT KATHRYN BYRNE Which ones are they ? LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY There 's a list on my pad , with all the names crossed off but three . LIEUTENANT KATHRYN BYRNE Right  --  Try to fall asleep . LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY I 'll just sit here . KATHY goes out between tents Left. p. 74 MART Hey , Peter . Where 's Peter ? He starts round the tent . WINKLE . OutsideHe 's digging an extra slit trench . MART Going round the tentPeter ! PETER comes from behind the tent with an entrenching shovel in his hand . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Right here . MART Peter , I just decoded it . I knew you 'd want to read this . He hands PETER the message . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU After a pauseCall Sequoia , will you , and tell them I 'd like to talk to Lieutenant Dammartin , before twenty-one o'clock . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can find Captain Sutton . MART goes to the phone . PETER stands studying the message . TOMMY has fallen asleep in the chair , her head against the tent . MART Sequoia ? Lieutenant Dammartin there ?  --  Merci.  --  Merci beaucoup . Over . He hangs up . He 's on his way here . Started around fifteen . p. 75 SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU The Captain 's probably having tea . MART I 'll find him . He goes out Right . PETER looks up from the dispatch and sees TOMMY . He goes over to her and after a moment gently puts back her hair , which has fallen over her forehead . She does n't move . He bends over and kisses her lips . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Tommy ? LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY Opens her eyes with difficulty . Peter ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU You were working all night , were n't you ? LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY I do n't remember . At the moment  --  I ca n't remember anything . Not even where I am . I must have lost my mind . SERGEANT PETER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY Oh , yes . She sits up slowly . You kissed me . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU I 've been wanting to for a long time . LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY It was n't fair , though . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Why ? p. 76 LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY I was asleep . I 'm still asleep . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU It was the only chance I had . LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY I have to go . Time to serve the boys their chow . I was going to give those last three injections . No , Kathy was SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU What ? LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY Never mind . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU You are dopey , are n't you ? How long since you 've had a night 's sleep ? LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY I sleep . I can sleep anywhere . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Are n't we ever going to get together again , Tommy ? LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY Peter , what in hell would I want with you ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Look , girl  --  LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY You ca n't answer that and I certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But seeing you here all the time  --  and remembering  --  I ca n't stand it . You never look at me . You 're always behind a barrage of instruments and anaesthetics and mops and dishes in that station . And I know it 's not really that way . p. 77 LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY Oh , it 's not ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU No . I have to look at you , and you 're there all the time  --  and I want you , and you want me  --  and nothing ever comes of it . We just work .  --  I know you when I see you  --  even a long way off . I know every little thing you wear . When something 's different I know . But you 're always going the other way . LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY I do n't believe any of it , Peter . Or not much of it  --  SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU But it 's true  --  LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY No , what 's true is that things do n't last in a war , just as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get before it goes by . It wo n't be here tomorrow and you wo n't be either . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU God knows I could wish it was different , but  --  LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY It would have been all right if you 'd been somewhere else , I could have forgotten all about you . But you 're right here , and every time I see you , I always just want you and nobody else . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU That 's what I was hoping . I love you , Tommy . LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY No , that 's an entirely different matter . To you I 'm just that nurse , what was her name , Tommy , the one that went by fast somewhere in Tunisia . But maybe it 's better this way . It 's better to know that nothing 's ever forever . p. 78 SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU That 's a damn pessimistic view . When can I see you ? LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY Later . Right now I 'm on duty . She turns to go . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Things are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is D day ? She turns back . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Something like that . LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY Do you know when things start ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU There 's a patrol this afternoon . Then tonight something happens . Will you give me a kiss for luck ? LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY Yes . She comes over and kisses him lightly . They separate , then she rushes back to him , they embrace and kiss again . That 's better . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Jeez , we have wasted a lot of time . LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY Have n't we ?  --  I must go now . She turns away , PETER holding on to her hand . SUTTON enters Right CAPTAIN SUTTON You sent for me , I believe , Sergeant . p. 79 SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU I ca n't give an order to an officer . CAPTAIN SUTTON In that case I 'll finish my tea . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Oh , just a moment  --  just a moment , please . CAPTAIN SUTTON I see . You did send for me , but you do n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something we ought to talk about  --  CAPTAIN SUTTON I find myself in a very humorous position here , Sergeant . A damned Yankee non-com walks in , takes my girl , takes over my functions , gives me orders , and in effect makes me out a muckin ' jackass  --  all in the name of military discipline . It 's a good joke , but I 'm getting weary of it . How much longer am I likely to think it 's funny ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU I 'm sorry , sir . but I ca n't step very far from the ' phone and an order just came over the teletype  --  He crosses to table . LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY She crosses to SUTTON . I believe I heard you say that Peter took your girl . CAPTAIN SUTTON I said that . Yes . LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY Well , he did n't . Nobody takes me from anybody . If I leave one man and take up with another , it 's my own doing . I do as I please . That 's one thing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property any more . She 's a person in her own right  --  as good as a man  --  and as much her own as a man . You two quarrel over anything you like , but do n't think for a minute you 're quarreling over me . The only tag I wear is the dog-tag around my neck . She turns to go. p. 80 CAPTAIN SUTTON Tommy  --  will you wait just a minute ? TOMMY stops . Seems to me I remember a very competent nurse that transferred to the 8th Army from the Americans about a month ago . Quiet little girl , all business ; everybody liked her but she was n't playing . Well , I checked into her ward with some shrapnel embedded in my obverse , we understood each other and we got acquainted . For a time she would n't talk much but when the tale finally came out there was an American sergeant in it . His name was Peter and he did not emerge as an admirable character . Does that speech of yours mean you 're going back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes . CAPTAIN SUTTON God knows I have n't much to offer . While the war 's on we 're all desert rats together . I 've been in it so damn long I 've forgotten everything I ever knew except fighting and when it 's over I think I 'd bet more on the blast furnaces of Pittsburgh than on the British Aristocracy  --  Yes , and I have a wife somewhere  --  I remember that because I have a picture of her  --  but even so I 'm certain you 'll find me more dependable than Sergeant Peter here for as long as I last . I do n't want to lose you , Tommy . LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY I have to go with Peter . I did n't want to . But I ca n't help it . p. 81 CAPTAIN SUTTON They say the test of civilization is whether the man decides or the woman . I 'm not sure how civilized I am , because I 'm not giving you up , and I expect you back ! And damn soon . LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomorrow . Or who 'll be there . She exits between tents Left . CAPTAIN SUTTON Well , shall we get back to this mucking war ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU If it is n't one war , it 's another . Handing the teletype page to SUTTONYou want to see this ? CAPTAIN SUTTON ReadingThe Jerries are already in the pass , then ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Yes . They did n't try to hold them at the upper end . There seems to be a better position at the South exit . The plan is to bottle the Jerries up in there . CAPTAIN SUTTON Well , what do we do ? He sits . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU I 'm trying to find a trail up to the crest overlooking the pass so we can chuck stuff down on them from up above . CAPTAIN SUTTON Is this your idea ? p. 82 SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU No . It 's from corps headquarters . CAPTAIN SUTTON I think there is such a trail . I did n't map it because I was n't sure where it started , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PETER MOLDAU Simeon 's been moisenflaying with the local goat-herds and such . He may locate one that can give us the information . CAPTAIN SUTTON Well , let 's suppose there is a path that will take us to a position behind the Jerries . What do we do ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU I want to get up there behind them tonight and pour down murder on the pass . CAPTAIN SUTTON How many men will we have ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Just what we can pick up here around the message center . It may come to thirty or forty . CAPTAIN SUTTON That 's pretty slim to really pour down murder . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Yes . But it 's all we 've got . CAPTAIN SUTTON You 'll send a patrol up this afternoon ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU If I can find the way . CAPTAIN SUTTON I 'd like to go . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Good . We can both go . p. 83 CAPTAIN SUTTON And tonight we take our thirty or forty and try to muck up the pass ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for one thing . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU What 's that ? CAPTAIN SUTTON By one of those inconceivable fatalities that are always happening in a war here you are again without an officer and here am I hanging around acting as staff . When you go up there this afternoon will that be your first patrol ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU No . I 've taken out patrols . CAPTAIN SUTTON Do you feel sufficiently experienced to handle this ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Well , it 's up to me to handle it . I 've had some experience . More would be better . But the only way to get more experience is to have it . CAPTAIN SUTTON Well , I hope I 'm not unduly egotistical , but I 've had a lot of contact with Jerries . I think I 'll know what 's to be done here the instant I get a look at the terrain  --  and I doubt that you will . I think you should let me take over . From this point on . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU I 'm certainly going to ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same . A man 's either in command or he 's not . A commanding officer is constantly finding himself in a jam of one kind or another , and having to make decisions  --  instantly . One mistake and you 're gone . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU I know . CAPTAIN SUTTON Then there 's no time to ask advice , is there ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU No . CAPTAIN SUTTON I do have a point ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU There 's no doubt that you 've had more experience than I 've had . And very possibly you 're more competent to be in command . CAPTAIN SUTTON It 's simple , then . Call the non-coms together and tell them from now on they take orders from me . They 'll go along . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Of course they would , but I have no right to do it . No authority . And I do n't think Captain Johnson would have the authority either . You 're a staff officer , not a line officer . You 're not in the chain of command . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . CAPTAIN SUTTON Look , Sergeant . You 're sticking to the book on this . The book says line officers command , staff officers advise , but when you get into battle things get too hot for these fine distinctions and they melt . p. 85 SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Well , that may be true . But right now I ca n't take anybody 's word on a thing like that . I have to stick by my orders . I 'm supposed to command here and I 'll have to do it . CAPTAIN SUTTON Christ , I 've heard about Americans , but when you actually meet them it 's worse ! They 're out to save the world , but only if they can run it ! SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Well , what in hell do you mean , coming to me and asking me to turn over a command to you ? I do n't make the rules . I 'm not running the army ! Go to somebody that is running the army ! Talk about Americans ! The British are no better than anybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time ! CAPTAIN SUTTON You know what depends on holding this pass ! The whole bloody line could depend on it ! SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU I know that . CAPTAIN SUTTON Do you mean to risk losing it , with inexperienced leadership , and losing men 's lives , when there 's an experienced man here ? And do you expect me to risk my own neck under you ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU You can stay here . CAPTAIN SUTTON Oh , forget the bloody books and let me catch the mucking bastards on the flank ! If I thought you could do it , I 'd say for Christ 's sake go ahead ! But I doubt it  --  and you doubt it ! I 'm making a formal demand , right now , that you turn this post over to me. p. 86 SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU I ca n't do it , Captain Sutton  --  and I wo n't do it . CAPTAIN SUTTON You could be damn well court-martialed  --  SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU I 'll have to take that chance , I know . I think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out about the trail . SIMEON enters Right , followed by MABROUKHA and an ARAB GUIDE . SIMEON Hey , Pete . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Any news for us , Simeon ? SIMEON Beg pardon , sir . He salutes . The CAPTAIN returns the salutation . Son-of-a-gun , Peter , but we 've got an old Snerb right off the desert . He spends all his time herding grinks over the hills here , and he says there 's a path  --  CAPTAIN SUTTON Good God , look at that face ! SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU He 's certainly got a villainous looking face , Simeon . SIMEON You ca n't tell by that . Hell , they all look kind of vimilforty . No blamis about ' em . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Well , ask him . SIMEON There is a path . Anyway the Snerb says so . It 's there but the Germans know about it . His brother sold out to them . p. 87 SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Maybe we 've got the wrong family . I 'd be happier about it if he had a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the path at night . SIMEON Gaw-wood-na-l-doo-aj fil-lel.The Arab . El-Al-man hoom-ma hi-nak ba-e-da . MABROUKHA The Germans  --  they are there . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Ask him if he 'll lead us anyway . MABROUKHA Gaw-wood-na wa-kha ? THE ARAB Aywa . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU He says yes , but he certainly looks like a Barbary pirate . MABROUKHA Hoo-wa wa-hid ra-jil sa-fee . SIMEON Mabroukha says he 's honest . She says we can trust the old Snerb . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Maybe we 're going to have to climb up there and push the Germans off that ridge . CAPTAIN SUTTON How many are there ? SIMEON To MABROUKHAAsk him how many Germans on ridge . MABROUKHA Ash min a-dad dil Al-man fil-ja-bel ? THE ARAB Je ne sais pas . p. 88 MABROUKHA He does not know . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU We might have to try it . Can you amuse Akim Tamiroff till we want him ? SIMEON We 'll just feed him . That can last as long as necessary . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Take him out and feed him then . We may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We eat . Toltash , taffelsnords . He indicates eating with gestures . Frimps and hermilberris  --  with cream . THE ARAB Ah  --  kataherech ! Checka ! SIMEON , MABROUKHA and the ARAB go out Right . CAPTAIN SUTTON By God , I 'm beginning to believe they understand him ! This is a real job , Sergeant . The Germans are up there waiting for us . You 'd better reconsider . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU I ca n't . But I would like to have you along . CAPTAIN SUTTON Oh , I 'll go . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Thanks . CAPTAIN SUTTON I think I 'll be needed . There is a hornet hum , rapidly growing louder . It swells to the sound of approaching planes. p. 89 MART Yelling from up Right . Jerries ! They 're at it again ! He leaps for an opening and disappears round the tent . SUTTON and PETER are after him in a flash . The plane goes overhead making a terrific racket , and the noise of a machine gun adds to the din . A brace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut in two and falls on the cot . The planes gradually die out . MART , PETER and the CAPTAIN reappear , dusting themselves . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU GrimIt cut the net right where we were standing . CAPTAIN SUTTON Also grimIf I 'm not killed in this war I 'm certainly going to be scared to death . MART Shaking his head , rather bewilderedSomething hit me . I do n't know what it was . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU It was me . CAPTAIN SUTTON You were on the bottom . MART Oh . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Something hit me , too , and I know what it was . It was the Captain . CAPTAIN SUTTON I should have worn my heavy boots . p. 90 SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Jeez , somebody was hurt . He looks out to the Right . SIMEON enters , carrying MABROUKHA and followed by the ARAB . SIMEON See if you can get the doctor , will you ? Mabroukha was hit . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Mart ! MART runs out between tents Left . PETER and SUTTON clear the cot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were all right . I thought they missed us . But then she fell down  --  and she 's  --  CAPTAIN SUTTON Where was she hit ? SIMEON God , I do n't know . KATHY , TOMMY and MART enter from between tents Left . TOMMY unloosens MABROUKHA 'S clothes while KATHY removes her yakmish . LIEUTENANT KATHRYN BYRNE She 's beautiful . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Yeah . I never saw her face before . SIMEON Is it bad , Tommy ? Is it going to be serious ? Can I carry her to the hospital ? LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY No . SIMEON What can I do ? p. 91 LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY There 's a machine-gun bullet through her heart and another through her right lung . She was dead when you laid her here , Simeon . SIMEON I see . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU She was beautiful . SIMEON Are you sure , Tommy ? LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY Yes . The ARAB comes forward and gently replaces the yakmish over MABROUKHA 'S face . THE ARAB La illaha il ullah . In shallah . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it means , The Will of Allah be done . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU I ca n't quite go along in that . LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY Come on , Simeon . I know how it is . It 's better not to look too long . I 'll send some of the bearers over . She puts an arm round him . SIMEON All right . But he stands staring at MABROUKHA . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Crossing to SIMEONYou 're coming with me , Simeon . We 're making a reconnaissance patrol along that trail . I 'll need you . p. 92 SIMEON All right , Peter . He turns to go with PETER . CURTAIN p. 93 Act 2 , Scene 2 Act Two : SCENE II SCENE : The dry bed of a stream in the mountains above Mazzouna . A foot-bridge has been blown apart so that the broken ends rest on the floor of the gully . The region is rocky desert , with occasional brush . A few loose rocks have fallen in the foreground . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU OutsideHey , Dougie  --  duck around under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keep your head down . DOUGIE comes in . There is a rifle shot in the distance . What do you see ? DOUGIE This is pretty good , Sarge . Cover on three sides and you can look all the way down the valley . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Get in there , Chuck , and take Oujda with you . DOUGIE Wait a minute . When I fire put your head down and run for it . A rifle cracks just outside and CHUCK comes in , head down , followed by OUJDA , the ARAB GUIDE . As they come in , there is a rifle shot in the distance . CHUCK Hit anything ? DOUGIE I would n't know . He fires again . PETER and SIMEON come in . There is another rifle shot in the distance. p. 94 SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Who 's missing ? CHUCK Augie 's behind that big rock about fifty yards back . There 's a sniper got him pinned there , and every time he shows anything the sniper lets go at him . He is not happy . SIMEON walks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to set up the radioThey 've got us all pretty well pinned down . I would n't like to start out of here standing up .  --  Look , here 's the situation . We ca n't stay here very long , because the Germans know we 're here  --  and it 's going to be rugged when we start back . We 'll have to do a lot of crawling . But if anybody can see where that mortar fire 's coming from it 's worth it , because then we 'll know where to find the Jerries tonight . Do n't expose yourself , but keep a look-out . He motions to Chuck to stand guard Right . SIMEON You can see part of the ridge from this side , Sarge . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU O.K. Keep your eyes open , but do n't stick your neck out . I got you into this and I do n't want to lose any of you . That 's all . I 've got to make some kind of map so we can find our way back up the trail tonight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his note-book . The men shift to watch for enemy positions. p. 95 SIMEON What happened back there , Pete ? I was having trouble with my pack and could n't keep up  --  SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Hopper stepped into something  --  probably a mine  --  and got blown clear off the trail and caught on the rocks down below where we could n't get at him . We could see you could n't do anything for him . He was all blown apart and screaming so loud you could hear him all up and down the valley . That 's what brought the snipers down on us . SIMEON I do n't know what you could have done about that . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU I could have shot him and kept him quiet . That 's what the Captain said I should have done . And he 's right . DOUGIE That 's no reason for him to think he 's running the whole war . He thinks he 's the O.C. here now . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU I guess maybe he is . He 's certainly giving the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And he knows it , too . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU If the Jerries had n't heard that screaming we could have slipped up here and down again without meeting a soul . CHUCK You just ca n't do things like that . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU In a war you do . You have to . It was one dying man 's life against a dozen healthy men . That 's the logic of war and that 's one of the things we have to learn . If any of you get killed up here it 's my error  --  and if the Jerries block this trail tonight and we ca n't relieve Joslin that 's my error too . p. 96 SIMEON What happened to Hopper ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU The Captain shot him . But too late . The Jerries had caught on where we were . A man can make a fool of himself damn quick in this business . The ARAB looks in . CHUCK Crossing to the ARABOujda seems to think we can see more from over there . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Keep under cover . DOUGIE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DOUGIE and OUJDA go out Left . A mortar is heard firing in the distance . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU I wish I had an extra crystal for this thing . SIMEON Crossing to radioI always carry a spare . I 'll slip it in . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Want help with that ? Something wrong ? With your arm ? SIMEON No , no . I had a little talk with George on the way up , Pete , and I found out why he 's working with us . He 's a man of principle . With him it 's a matter of conviction . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU I 'm certainly glad to hear it . p. 97 SIMEON Yeah . Last week he was working for the Germans . They paid him off in Vichy francs , and when he took the stuff down to market , it brought about half-a-cent to the nickel . Right there he began to lose faith . He began to see there was something rotten in the entire German way of life . Because the Americans pay off in Tunisian francs , twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An old McKinley man . So out of conviction he came over to our side . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU What 's the matter ? Were you nicked ? SIMEON I ca n't use this hand , Pete . I can move it , but I ca n't feel anything with it . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Sure one of those snipers did n't reach you ? SIMEON No , I do n't think so . No blood anywhere . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Let me see your hand . Can you feel that ? SIMEON No . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU When did it happen ? When that German got the drop on us ? SIMEON Away before that . When we first left the camp . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Oh ! Well , you just have to rest it , that 's all . SIMEON Why , did you ever know it to happen to anybody else ? p. 98 SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU God , yes . SIMEON Without being hit or anything ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Sure . It happens all the time . A man 's all wired up inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he thinks too hard about one thing it burns out wires . SIMEON Oh , you mean the elfinan is supposed to cross the parcrum but the taurus has a reduced operational voiture and that cuts off everything below the amphibrac . Sure  --  it 's an obvious case . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU You do n't say ? SIMEON Yeah , I 'm scared , Pete . SitsThis is a sign of . Am I losing my mind ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Hell , no . SIMEON Of course , you can always ask , how would that affect me any if I lost my mind ? But I 'm scared . I 've always been a kind of clown , making fun of everything , but now I 'm really ridiculous . I 'm so ridiculous it 's driving me nuts . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU What the hell are you talking about ? SIMEON The way I am inside , Pete . Look , am I a complete half-wit  --  or is there sense in it ? Damn it , she was an Arab , and a Mohammedan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her  --  but that 's what I wanted to do . p. 99 SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Well , why not ? SIMEON Because it 's crazy , Pete . And on top of it , this crazy business ! What 's happening to me ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Oh , hell , in this war anything can happen . And nearly everything does . When this is over and we get home and they begin to ask us what was it like we 're going to open our traps to say something and then we 're going to realize nobody at home will ever know  --  and we ca n't tell ' em  --  and we 're going to shut our traps and keep ' em shut . Because it 's impossible . Look at Mabroukha . The way she came into camp . How could you tell your mother and sisters and the folks on the next block about that ? And then look at you , falling in love with her . How could you make anybody back home believe that ? And now you ca n't feel with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl you purchased for eight hundred francs . How is anybody at home going to savvy that business ? No , this mucking war is out of this mucking world and out of range of the English language . I defy anybody to tell anybody what Africa 's like . You ca n't even describe the stink of it , let alone how it feels to be here and what it does to you . But when you 're here you get used to the stink , and you get used to running up against indescribable stuff of every kind  --  because here it is . It 's just , by God , here . p. 100 SIMEON What do you do when you 're in love with a girl and she 's dead ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU That happens , too .  --  How 's the hand now ? He takes SIMEON 'S hand . SIMEON About the same , I guess . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Can you open it ? SIMEON Yes . But I ca n't feel when it 's open or when it 's shut . THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the Captain . THE RADIO Almanac One calling Almanac . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Almanac . Sergeant Moldau speaking . Over . THE RADIO Sutton speaking . Where are you ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Under the foot-bridge  --  the one that shows on the map . It 's been blown up , though , and ca n't be used . THE RADIO We can see Jerries crossing the upper end of the ravine . They 'll be down on you in fifteen minutes . You never should have gone up there , and you 'll have to move fast . Over . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU The snipers have got the path covered , Captain , and we have n't found out much yet  --  A mortar is heard firing in the distance. p. 101 THE RADIO For God 's sake , move , and move fast !  --  SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU O.K. We 'll have to make a dash for it . Over . He hangs up . Dougie , Chuck ! We 're getting out . DOUGIE and CHUCK come in . DOUGIE Hey , Pete , I just saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? DOUGIE It came drifting over the mountain  --  a little white puff right after they fired . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Point it out to me . DOUGIE Look . They go to the Left . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU I get it . That 's Djebel Nef on the map . He turns . Look , fellows , get the stuff together . We 're going to have to make a break right through the sniping . There 's no cover the first ten or fifteen feet . It wo n't do any good to crawl because they 're shooting down on us , and it wo n't make much difference whether we go one at a time or several together . Simeon and I will go first . They pack up . Chuck , stick something out to draw fire . Stay on my left , Simeon . CHUCK sticks out a cap on the end of a gun . There is a rifle crack in the distance . Here we go . PETER and SIMEON duck out . There is another shot in the distance. p. 102 DOUGIE Under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , quick . SIMEON OutsideWhat 's the matter ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Get in there . PETER and SIMEON come in , SIMEON dazed . I told you to stay on my left . SIMEON I get everything wrong . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Sit down . Where is it ? SIMEON It feels like something 's wrong with my back . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Get that stuff off him . SIMEON That would happen to me , too . I want to be a hero , and what happens ? I get shot in the back . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Yeah . It 's not bleeding , but they got him in the side . We can use the sulfa and the morphine , anyway . You 'll be all right , Simeon . SIMEON I do n't have to fight this war any more , do you realize that ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Shut up , Simeon . You 'll be all right . Where 's the case ? The ARAB enters p. 103 THE ARAB Al Al-man ! SIMEON The Germans ? THE ARAB Aywa . SIMEON Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guys are healthy . Do n't stick around here for me , and get yourselves killed . That 's the logic of war , you said it yourself . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU You 'll be fine . They break out the sulfa and the needle . SIMEON Yeah ? Sometimes you say things to fellows to keep ' em going . You think of the thing the sergeant ought to say , and you say it . You know God damn well I wo n't be all right . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU You want to be left here on the mountain ? SIMEON What difference does it make now ? I used to believe you when you talked about soldiers being married to the army and living off the country . But it 's all wrong . It 's not true . If you have n't got somebody to go back to , what 's it all good for ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Still working with the bandageYou 're talking to me about Tommy ? SIMEON No , I 'm talking about yourself . If you 're a soldier all alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone you have n't got any country , and it 's no use going home . I 'm alone now . p. 104 SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU You two carry him while I keep the snipers busy . I know where one of them is and maybe I can scare the others . They lift SIMEON . SIMEON Damn it , Peter , if you 're a good soldier you 'll get your men the hell out of here ! SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU I 'm taking care of you , Simeon . I need you . And do n't you forget it . SIMEON You take care of yourself . I 'm full of dope , and I 'm fine . PETER goes to the Right with a rifle . A shot is heard . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Now try it . DOUGIE and CHUCK carry SIMEON out . The rifle cracks again . CURTAIN p. 105 Act 2 , Scene 3 Act Two : SCENE III SCENE : Before the tent , nine o'clock the same evening .

How that girl loves to torture me ! WINKLE What girl ? CHUCK My wife . Look . She sends me a new picture of herself . In a bathing suit . Showing all the curves .

Set me down anywhere in the United States , any state , any town . I 'll find my way home .  --  I 'll walk home , that 's how I feel . Where 's the muckin ' chow ?

Yeah , Mart talking .  --  Yes , Peter took a small patrol up along that path and there are Germans up there all right . He had a little brush with an outpost and took some prisoners . He 's going to interrogate but he does n't expect to get much . He 'll certainly get in there if he can . What 's cooking at the lower end ?  --  You want me to tell Peter that ?  --  Did we lose many ?  --  Yeah . Yeah . Yes , sir . Wilco . He hangs up . TOMMY enters from between tents Left .

WINKLE and DOUGIE and CHUCK go out Left . PETER enters from between tents Right. p. 108 SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU I want to get Joslin on the phone . MART He just called and gave me a message for you . Do you want me to call back anyway ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU No . What was the message ? TOMMY comes out from tent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hypodermic . MART He says they 've got a permanent barrage laid at the end of the pass and it 's holding the Afrika Korps up to the moment . A party broke through once and got chased back in . That part of it was pretty bloody and we lost quite a lot of men . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU From our company ? MART Eighteen or twenty from our company . The rest French . He says the French are doing fine only they 've slowed down their artillery fire and he 's going over there to find out why . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU What 's he doing with the casualties ? MART He 's sending all he can move over here . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU You hear that , Tommy ? LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY We 'll have to put some on the floor , I 'm afraid . But we 'll manage .

I said you 'd certainly do it if you could . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU O.K. That was all ? MART That was all . By the way , Peter , I 've been trying to locate a padre , but the nearest is about seven miles down the valley . The chaplain is over at the Sequoia hospital . Trying to get back here between twenty-one and twenty-two . There 's some casualties coming in at Sequoia , too . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Let me know if you hear from him again , will you ? MART Sure . You know , Peter , I 've been thinking about hand-books ,  --  and you know the hand-book I 'm waiting for them to issue ? p. 110 SERGEANT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the natives in the United States  --  and how to get along with Americans . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Yeah , we 'd all like to see that one . DAMMARTIN enters from Right . Hello , Lieutenant . Anything wrong over there ? LIEUTENANT DAMMARTIN Yes . We have run short of ammunition both for the seventy-fives and the 81 millimeter mortars , and our own supply has failed to come up . Very likely they have no more at the dump . Is there anything you can send us ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Is that why you slowed your rate of fire ? LIEUTENANT DAMMARTIN Yes . We thought we could perhaps make it last till three o'clock . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Our ammunition 's all American . LIEUTENANT DAMMARTIN We are using some old seventy-fives . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Well , we can send a lot of that . LIEUTENANT DAMMARTIN Your ammunition works in our mortars . We 've tried it . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU We 'll give you all you 'll need ! Phone rings . STEFANO enters from Left . MART goes to phone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 111 MART Sycamore rear . LIEUTENANT DAMMARTIN Nothing since breakfast . And again must I eat from the hands of an Italian ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU You can always carry it for yourself . LIEUTENANT DAMMARTIN Yes . Exits Left . KATHY enters between tents Left . LIEUTENANT KATHRYN BYRNE One , two , three , where 's my dinner ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Coming right off the fire , I gather . LIEUTENANT KATHRYN BYRNE And what is this dinner ? She sniffs . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Looks like slop on a shingle to me . Camel meat and rice . KATHY sits at table . SUTTON enters from tent . MART Lieutenant Joslin wants to talk to you , Peter . MART crosses to cot . PETER goes to phone . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Hello , Lieutenant . DAMMARTIN enters from Left with his plate full . LIEUTENANT KATHRYN BYRNE Is it good ? p. 112 LIEUTENANT DAMMARTIN I think it is the worst I have ever tasted . LIEUTENANT KATHRYN BYRNE Camel ? LIEUTENANT DAMMARTIN I would say rather yes . Probably camel . LIEUTENANT KATHRYN BYRNE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think the same . LIEUTENANT KATHRYN BYRNE Yes . It was never a very good camel , and age has n't improved it . CAPTAIN SUTTON Go on . Encourage me . Tell me more about it . LIEUTENANT DAMMARTIN To me it is a new flavor , the very essence of North Africa . CAPTAIN SUTTON Concentrated ? LIEUTENANT DAMMARTIN Yes . Eating it you understand Tunisia . Why nobody lives here but Arabs and why the Arabs hate the whole world . STEFANO brings MART and SUTTON each a plate . CAPTAIN SUTTON For the mess we are about to receive the Lord make us duly thankful . LIEUTENANT KATHRYN BYRNE Is that high church ? CAPTAIN SUTTON Very . Why this is exquisite . LIEUTENANT KATHRYN BYRNE I 've heard the English like their meat a bit dated . p. 113 CAPTAIN SUTTON A bit ? We bury it like dogs and dig it up months later . LIEUTENANT KATHRYN BYRNE I can understand why you 'd bury it , but why dig it up ? LIEUTENANT DAMMARTIN If the English can do it the French can do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cot and sits . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Hangs up phone . Will you get Chuck for me , Mart ? MART Sure . He goes out Right . TOMMY comes out from tent and sits . PETER crosses to table . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Joslin says they 're being pushed hard down there . He came pretty close to saying it depended on us  --  whether they could hold . CAPTAIN SUTTON We do n't know how many Jerries are up there . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Maybe we ought to interrogate now . If we 're to start at the moonrise we 'll have to hurry . LIEUTENANT DAMMARTIN Yes , I think so . The moon rises at twenty-two , or a little after . We have about twenty-five minutes . MART re-enters . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU You 're not getting much chance at that plate , Mart . Now I want the two prisoners for interrogation . One German , one Italian . MART starts to exit between tents Right . For God 's sake , try to find a couple who understand English . p. 114 MART I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awkward to have everything jammed up this way because I asked the chaplain to try to get here before twenty-two to perform a marriage ceremony over a couple of unbelievers . LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY Arabs ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU About as heathen as Arabs . LIEUTENANT KATHRYN BYRNE I do n't understand . The chaplain 's coming here ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Yes . LIEUTENANT KATHRYN BYRNE Who 's getting married , Peter ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU I thought I would . LIEUTENANT KATHRYN BYRNE You ? Who 's the unfortunate girl ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Tommy . LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY RisingNo , Peter , thank you . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU I know it looks silly , but  --  LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY But you 're doing it for me . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU No . LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY You 're doing it for me , Peter . You can forget it . p. 115 SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU I 'm not doing it for you . LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY Who , then ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU For me . LIEUTENANT KATHRYN BYRNE Why , Peter . This is so sudden . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MOLDAU Yes . LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY He thinks I want to get married . He thinks I have some silly feminine notion about it , so he 'll do it to please me . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU You 're wrong , Tommy . That 's not the way it is . SUTTON starts to rise . LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY No . Do n't go ! SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Look , Tommy , have you changed your mind about me ? LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY Yes . Oh , I wanted you to say this . I wanted you to ask me to marry you . But I do n't want you to worry about me or try to take care of me . I 've been here a long time . I 'm an old hand and I 'm useful where I am . So keep yourself free , and after this is all over you can go back and marry a sweet young thing who was never run over by a war . I wish I were a sweet young thing , and I wish to God I 'd never seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about that . I 've got work to do . Exits between tents Left. p. 116 LIEUTENANT KATHRYN BYRNE RisingShe 's trying to make you say you love her , you sad sack . Follows TOMMY out . PETER rises and starts to follow her . CHUCK enters Right . CHUCK is a sergeant . CHUCK You want me , Peter ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Yeah , I 'm afraid this is an all night job . It 's about twenty-one forty now and the moon rises soon after twenty-two . That gives you at least twenty minutes . I want you to load the weapons carriers with shells for seventy-fives and eighty-one millimeter mortars . The French are running low on ammunition . CHUCK It has to get there tonight ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Before three . CHUCK I do n't know the place . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Lieutenant Dammartin will ride with you . CHUCK How are the mine fields ? LIEUTENANT DAMMARTIN If we wait for the moon I can find the way through . CHUCK I thought I was going up on the ridge with you tonight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . p. 117 CHUCK We 'd better get started loading . Seventy-fives and eighty-one millimeter . He exits Right with DAMMARTIN . MART enters from between tents Right . MART Pete , I got one Heinie and one Eytie for you . Ready for ' em ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Bring them in . MART exits . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU You 've had more experience with this , sir . Will you put the questions ? CAPTAIN SUTTON Not I. You stick to your prerogatives . Ask for yourself . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU All right . If you say so . MART enters , followed by the GERMAN prisoner , guarded by DOUGIE ; and the ITALIAN prisoner , guarded by WINKLE . To the GermanYou speak English ? CORPORAL HERMANN GEIST A little , yes . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU I 'm supposed to find out from you as much as possible , you know that ? CORPORAL HERMANN GEIST Yes , naturlich . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU You 'll probably refuse to answer , but I 'm asking anyway . How many men did you have in the party overlooking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU You do n't mind giving your name ? CORPORAL HERMANN GEIST I am Corporal Hermann Geist . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU And your organization ? CORPORAL HERMANN GEIST That I can not say . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU You 're a very careful man . He leafs through several identification books , picking out the one belonging to Geist . Your papers were in perfect order and they gave your company and your corps . CORPORAL HERMANN GEIST The papers will be returned to me ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU After the war . Yes . CORPORAL HERMANN GEIST I shall have them before that . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU You think so ? Puts GEIST 'S identification book in his pocket . CORPORAL HERMANN GEIST Casablanca is in German hands . You are already cut off here in the Mediterranean . You were fools to venture into the Mediterranean , you Americans , for now we have the west coast and you will never get out . I shall be recaptured. p. 119 SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU The last I heard Casablanca was the main port of entry for American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with propaganda and you believe it . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU I see . They fill us with propaganda . CORPORAL HERMANN GEIST Why not ? You have no education . When those who lead are military idiots not much can be expected of the schwine who follow . PETER makes a move to rise . SUTTON stops him with a hand on his shoulder . CAPTAIN SUTTON We were amazed at the accuracy of your fire , corporal . You dropped those shells just where you wanted them . Did you have howitzers up on the mountain ? CORPORAL HERMANN GEIST No . Only mortars . Our mortars are accurate . CAPTAIN SUTTON They must be . And you use them with deadly efficiency . You must be specially chosen men , all of you . CORPORAL HERMANN GEIST In my division , yes . We are all specially chosen . CAPTAIN SUTTON It 's really hopeless to fight against such superb forces . So well equipped and in such great numbers . Now a small group like yours  --  how many did you say were up there ? p. 120 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I think you make a game of me . CAPTAIN SUTTON Do you indeed ?  --  You 'll find that we do n't play for fun , corporal . Achtung ! GEIST snaps to attention . Why you poor ignorant Teutonic bastard . Put up your hands ! Will you talk ? CORPORAL HERMANN GEIST No ! CAPTAIN SUTTON Get out , then ! Take him out and let him sweat a while , and then bring him back ! DOUGIE Yes , sir . DOUGIE and GEIST exit Right . CAPTAIN SUTTON To get anything out of a German you have to flatter him or else scare him to death . You ca n't really beat him but you can yell at him . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU You should have put the question . CAPTAIN SUTTON No . This one was hopeless anyway . WINKLE nudges the ITALIAN PRISONER closer to table . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU You speak English ? SQUILLINI Si , signor . Excuse me , I forget . Sure-a-ting . I was speak-a da English from my brothers when dey com-a back from-a da Chicago . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SQUILLINI Dominico . Dominico Squillini . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU How long since your brothers came back to Italy ? SQUILLINI Maybe a twenty-year . You ask-a da questions . I got ta da answers . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Where are your brothers now ? SQUILLINI Deysa fight-a da army . Not-a moch . Not-a fight moch . Dey loffa d'Americano . Dey loffa da great Americano men . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU They love the great Americans ? SQUILLINI Loffa dem . Roosefelt . Teodore Roosefelt , Tom Mix , Roberto di Taylor , Herberto Hooffer . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU You were up on the mountain with the Germans and the Italians ? SQUILLINI Si . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU How many Italians were there ? SQUILLINI Maybe da hundred . You say , " Hallo ! Come out ! " and d'Italianos put up da hands and come out . Dey got ta brains . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU How many Germans up there ? SQUILLINI Much-a Germans . Da hundred , see , maybe da two hundred . Mucha Germans . p. 122 MART Jesus . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU What kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ta everything . Machine-gun , mortar , everything . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU I guess that 's all . Gracias . CAPTAIN SUTTON You 're not asking about the enemy positions ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU No , sir . CAPTAIN SUTTON Well , it 's your affair . MART That 's all , Winkle . SQUILLINI Gracias . Gooda night . He goes out Right with WINKLE . MART Jesus . Looks like you were going up against a young army . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Do you think he 's telling the truth , sir ? CAPTAIN SUTTON You can leave me out from now on . I 've had my bellyful . As soon as I can manage it I 'm getting transferred and I 'm getting out from under . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU You 're getting transferred ? CAPTAIN SUTTON I am . And I want you to know why .  --  Exactly what I predicted happened . You made an error under fire and at that moment the command passed to me . You knew it . Everybody knew it . I was conducting the patrol . But suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next ridge , running unnecessary danger and incurring unnecessary casualties . p. 123 SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU We did n't go up there just for the climb ! We had something in mind ! CAPTAIN SUTTON Well , would you mind letting me in on what it was ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU The positions , for God 's sake ! We went up to take a look ! Dougie saw a little film of smoke over the trees on the next hill . So we took a chance and went up  --  and we got a squint at where the Jerries are before they drove us out of there ! You saved our lives all right , and you took the prisoners , but do you know where the bastards are roosting ? CAPTAIN SUTTON No , I do not . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU They 're holding the little plateau behind Djebel Nef . CAPTAIN SUTTON Damn your Pennsylvania soul , why could n't you say so ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU I 'm telling you now , it 's the first chance I 've had . CAPTAIN SUTTON Could you estimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of Germans . Could have been two hundred . CAPTAIN SUTTON Well , by God  --  you knew that , too , and you said nothing to me ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU I was n't sure ! It looked like a lot but I was n't sure .  --  And while we 're on this subject I want to tell you that I 've made up my mind to turn the command over to you whether I can do it legally or not-and they can court martial me if they want to ! I might have piece of luck  --  in fact I had one  --  but I do n't know enough yet and so to hell with the regulations ! p. 124 CAPTAIN SUTTON I told you I 'm getting out of this area and I am ! SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU You 'll still be around tonight . And it 's tonight we 're going to need you . CAPTAIN SUTTON You 're not going back up there tonight . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Why not ? CAPTAIN SUTTON Do you want to get your men merdered ? Two hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knock them out with thirty ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU I guess they 'd want to go . CAPTAIN SUTTON They 'll go anywhere you take them , but you 've got no right to lead them into that ! SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU If you 'd heard Joslin on the phone you 'd think I had . We might manage to get behind that plateau . I do n't think I could do it , but I think you could . CAPTAIN SUTTON Let 's get this thing clear . I 'm taking no responsibility here till I know where I stand . I asked for the command once and you refused it . If I take it now you 'll snatch it back presto the first time I disagree with you . Suppose I say no attack tonight ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Jesus . We have to go . CAPTAIN SUTTON That 's what I thought . You 're not turning the command over to me . You 're asking me to run the show as long as I run it your way ! I ca n't work with you on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't like your conditions , and I wo n't take any more ! p. 125 SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Do n't get the idea I do n't know I 've made mistakes . A top sergeant is in a tough position all the time , what with trying to be just a good dog , taking orders , to the officers , and a tin god that ca n't be wrong in front of the men . He has to act all the time . He has to act yes-sir , you 're right , sir , to the officers , and in front of the men he has to be like Napoleon Bonaparte and the Angel Gabriel bringing down revelations from the general staff in heaven . And when he gets stuck with too much authority the way I am , and there 's a staff officer technically under him the situation gets too damn confusing . But all I want really is for you and me and the rest of us to get together and kick the Germans out of there . CAPTAIN SUTTON What I want is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it fast . And I want to say right now that unless I decide when and where we go  --  and whether we go  --  I 'm not taking any responsibility . If I 'm running the show I 'm running it , and if you 're running the show you 're running it . That 's final . Now which do you want ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU After a pauseAll right . It 's your decision . Do we go or not ? CAPTAIN SUTTON Do you take orders from me ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU From now on all orders come from you . p. 126 CAPTAIN SUTTON As an officer I ca n't justify the attack . Reckless methods do n't pay off in long run . But sometimes a thing like this has to be done , and damme this looks like one of those times . So I 'll go . And I 'll take the command . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Thanks . I might have known you 'd say that . CAPTAIN SUTTON Against my better judgment I 'm beginning to like you  --  in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CAPTAIN SUTTON Yes , you son-of-a-bitch ! They shake . We 'd better start , too . The moon 'll be up before long . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Mart , will you go over to the mess and tell the boys where we 're going and ask how many want to come along ? MART Crosses LeftSure . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Tell them we 're carrying light mortars and heavy machine-guns . MART Sure . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Wait a minute . Was that right , sir ? CAPTAIN SUTTON That 's right . MART exits Left . TOMMY enters from between tents Left. p. 127 SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Tommy ! She stops . To SUTTONAnd do we have a couple of minutes before we start ? CAPTAIN SUTTON I ca n't see the moon yet . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Because no matter what comes of it there 's something I want to say to Tommy before we go up the hill . And I would n't mind if you heard it , Captain .  --  I guess the time comes when the war catches up with you , Tommy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what you meant when you said you wanted something to hold to . LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY I was wrong . There 's nothing anybody can hold to . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU There has to be . LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY In the middle of all this blood and death ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Yes . A lot of men die around you  --  and you do n't think about it  --  you put it out of your mind and go ahead  --  just being a soldier  --  and then suddenly it all catches up with you . And you hate war and all it does to you  --  and you know you have to go on with it , but you 've got to know something 's coming after it  --  you 've got to know this is n't all there is  --  LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY Can you see that far ahead ? I can't. p. 128 SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Simeon 's dead . He never wanted to come back down that hill . I knew that when we started up . He did n't get himself killed , mind you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed ? She sits . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU On the second ridge when we climbed up to look at the positions . I carried him as far as I could , and he told me to get some things out of his pocket , some things that had been Mabroukha 's , and then pretty soon it was n't any use carrying him any more , and the Germans were getting the range , so I had to leave him there . Turning , takes a step to SUTTONWe 'll go back tonight if we can , Captain ? CAPTAIN SUTTON Yes , surely . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU He was killed because I made a mistake . And others were killed  --  because I made a mistake . I have n't learned how to be hard enough and ruthless enough . And I got them killed because of that . All right . I 'll go ahead and learn to be ruthless and learn to be hard , and learn to be a better soldier , but I ca n't do it unless there 's soemthing beyond , unless there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , why did n't you say it before ? p. 129 SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU I did n't know it . You get in the army and they teach you it 's better to be footloose . And at first it looks like a holiday with your expenses paid and no responsibilities  --  and you think that 's a way to live . But you are n't living . You 're just taking orders and eating rations and killing  --  and you 're nothing  --  nothing !  --  unless you 've got a line out to that blessed place back there where there are homes and children and peace . Or a line to the future  --  or a hope of somebody that loves you and does n't let go . So , it is n't silly to be married , darling , even if one of us is killed . You have to have something like that  --  or you 're nothing  --  just nothing . LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY And suppose we lived through the war , what then ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Whatever people have together , we 'd have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , to cook for you , and live there for years  --  and you would n't mind what 's happened ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Nothing will ever matter except not losing you or getting lost from you . LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY Are we in love , Peter ? Enough to last all our lives ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU I am . I always was if I 'd let myself believe it . p. 130 LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY I am if you are . I always was . The phone rings . MART enters Left and crosses to phone . MART They all want to go , Pete . You 'll have about twenty-five . At the phoneYes . Sycamore . What ? Jeez , that 's no good . He is ? O.K. , I 'll tell him . He hangs upThere 's a road block and the chaplain 's stuck over at Sequoia . He 'll get here as soon as he can . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Well LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY It does n't matter , dear . We 'll say it to each other , and mean it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time ? CAPTAIN SUTTON Running pretty close . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Maybe we 'll have to put it off . I did n't want to , though . LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY Never mind . I wo n't ever forget . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU You carry a prayer-book , Captain Sutton . Do they print a marriage service in that ? CAPTAIN SUTTON Yes . It 's badly torn , but most of it 's legible , I think . p. 131 SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Could n't we just have somebody read out the questions ? LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY Do you really want it , Peter ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Yes , I do . LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY All right . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Captain Sutton ? CAPTAIN SUTTON Yes ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU You heard what I said to Tommy . And what she said to me . Would it be a little more  --  real  --  if you read the service ? CAPTAIN SUTTON I 've never done it . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Would you do it ? CAPTAIN SUTTON I do n't know how to make it solemn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here , stand over here , soldier . TOMMY and PETER cross Right . MART Running out LeftHey , fellow  --  the top 's getting married . Comes back in CAPTAIN SUTTON Mart , will you move the table back ? MART moves table Right , up and downstage . WINKLE runs across Left to Right upstage , taking in the scene. p. 132 WINKLE Off RightHey , fellow  --  Pete 's getting married ! CAPTAIN SUTTON ContinuesHas anyone a ring ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU This is n't a wedding ring . It was Mabroukha 's . CAPTAIN SUTTON There 'll be certain lapses in the text , but  --  even so , there 's a lot of it . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Could you just ask the questions ? KATHY enters from between tents Left . CAPTAIN SUTTON Yes . Peter , wilt thou have this woman to thy wedded wife ? Wilt thou love her , comfort her , honor and keep her , in sickness as in health , and forsaking all others , keep thee only unto her so long as ye both shall live ? DOUGIE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU I will . CAPTAIN SUTTON The page is torn here  --  but Tommy , you take Peter 's right hand in your right hand . She does so . I , Thomasina , take thee , Peter , to my wedded husband . LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY I , Thomasina , take thee , Peter , to my wedded husband . There is a hornet whirr in the distance. p. 133 CAPTAIN SUTTON To have and to hold from this day forward , for richer , for poorer  --  MART For God 's sake , are they strafing at night ? Get those lights ! EVERYBODY jumps except those concerned in the ceremony . MART throws switch on ridgepole of center tent . The hornet drone continues . TOMMY speaks out of the darkness .

Everybody except TOMMY , PETER and SUTTON throws himself to the ground . LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY During the height of the strafingPut your arms around me , Peter . The sound of the planes gradually becomes more distant. p. 134 LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY According to God 's holy ordinance , and thereto I give thee my troth . CAPTAIN SUTTON Put on the lights , Mart . MART does so . Is anybody hurt ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU He looks aroundNo . Not here . CAPTAIN SUTTON Where 's the ring ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Here .

SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU That was a nice bit about my worldly goods . MART Hey , Pete , I guess now we kiss the bride ! SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU I hear it 's done . MART Here we come , Tommy . Several of the MEN approach TOMMY p. 135 LIEUTENANT THOMASINA GREY Mart , I do n't want to kiss anybody  --  except Peter . Please . MART O.K. , Tommy . The MEN move back .

As soon as we hit the beach the gun-crew will unship the gun and start hauling it in through the surf . Everybody else will remain in the barge covering the landing against possible opposition . As soon as the gun 's out of the way I 'll give the word and we 'll all hit the beach . If the crew needs a hand with the gun the nearest man will grab on and help . Only do n't get caught on the damn thing and get pulled under . We lost men in Sicily that way . CHUCK How , Peter ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU If you get your pack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can imagine how . While we 're here we 'll go through the regular routine . Check your ammunition . They do so. p. 139 Be sure your pieces are locked . They do so . Loosen the slings on packs and guns . They obey . When we get to the beach we 'll hook them on . If you do n't hear the order take care of it for yourself . A VOICE The front barge is still lashing the gun . We 're always ready and somebody always holds it up . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU There 's no hurry . DOUGIE No , not by me . CHUCK Can anybody talk the language ? DOUGIE Hell , I 've even forgot my Italian . All the Italian I remember is the four prices . I learned them in Salerno " Effa da dolla . " " Una da dolla . " " Fifa da dolla . " " Tenna da dolla . " That 's as high as you go . In Salerno . CHUCK Some things you do n't find in the hand-book . DOUGIE Remember Mart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? CHUCK Mart was n't with us in Sicily . He got it in Africa , remember ? On Cape Bon . DOUGIE That 's right . WINKLE We 've landed on so Goddam many beaches and lost so Goddam many men you forget who was with you when . DOUGIE Ai n't it the truth ? CHUCK No matter who you lose you have to go on anyway . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Do n't forget a lot of Germans never got off Cape Bon . WINKLE No , that 's right . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU And the Germans never broke through that pass where we lost Simeon . CHUCK No . DOUGIE I wonder if there 's anybody that adds up ? SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Adds up ? DOUGIE Well , you know , Simeon did n't have to go up on that hill . Nor Sutton either . Does anybody give them credit ? CHUCK Back in Washington maybe there 's somebody . They give out Congressional medals . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Look . Every once in a while I have to make a speech to you soldiers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might try doing a little adding up for yourselves . Nobody will ever know those guys as well as we did  --  Simeon and Mart and the others . We knew what made them tick . They probably wo n't get any medals  --  but what we think about them , what you soldiers think about them , that 's worth more than medals .  --  They wanted to go home . We all want to go home . I have n't met a soldier yet that wanted to buy in on these foreign parts . America  --  that 's for us.  --  It 's certainly for me . I 've got a wife and I hope to God I can take her back there with me some time . I remember once I told you when it comes to girls a soldier lives off the country . I know better now . The best soldier is the one that has a picture in his pocket . And every time he looks at that picture it means home to him . It means his country and what he 's fighting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  --  But do you suppose we 'd be allowed to keep a place like that if we were n't willing to fight for it  --  and run our chance of dying among these Goddam European ruins to keep it ? Hell , no ! The year we go soft enough to say we wo n't fight for it there wo n't be any United States . Only we have n't gone soft yet . There 's Mart and Simeon and all the rest back there to prove it . And they 'd rather stay there , among the ruins , than let their country down . And so would we . On the other hand , we 're learning this game . Every time we land on a beach we do a better job of it . We 're going to take this town so damn fast they wo n't know what hit it . ABE Looking out p. 140 You can rev up , Peter . The captain 's cast off . SERGEANT PETER MOLDAU Wilco . DOUGIE What the hell 's the name of this town we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want to know ? Take the damn town and then look at the name on it . There is a sound of distant firing . Oh , oh  --  I guess they do n't want us in there . Swing those pieces over to fend us off . The SOLDIERS obey . Pour it on , skipper . The engine turns up at the rear of the barge . The MEN lean outward as the boat starts.
