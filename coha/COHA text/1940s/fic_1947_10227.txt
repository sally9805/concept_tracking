... ' Yes ? ' I suppose we are old , are n't we ? ' Fifty to sixty ? Is that old ? ' Then Miss Hedwig sighed . I do n't know , ' she said on a rush of breath . It 's not age so much , ' Miss Amelia said . It 's that we 've grown old without remembrances , with nothing to remember . ' We have remembrances , ' Miss Hedwig put in weakly . But Miss Amelia seemed not to hear . Were we ever young ? ' she asked . Were we ever young ! ' It was a weak echo , no real remonstrance . Some people can live on remembrances . We ca n't even do that . I sit around trying to remember better things from the past , richer times than these ' She paused , and then for the first time moved as she slapped one hand desperately down into the other on her lap . The sound was sharp in the room . Then she said , There are n't any , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There were and there still are . Why , even at that excursion last month , I enjoyed myself , was glad to be alive . ' Enjoyed yourself ! You did n't and neither did I. We 've pretended so long that it 's easy now . But enjoyment  --  no . Sitting around and watching other people 's children playing . ... You call that enjoyment ? ' Miss Hedwig snorted a little . Come , come , Amelia , you can go too far with this . I never wanted children , never grieved for that , at least . ' Again , Miss Amelia , wrapped in her own dream in the dusk , did not hear , but spoke remotely , fleetingly out of the dream to no one : ... one child fell and hurt his arm , and all the way home on the boat his mother held him in her lap , and I sat across from them and wanted nothing but to cry . It was dark on the lake , and I could just make out the blur ofP101his white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him , tried to soothe him . I felt terrible . I do n't know why , but everything made me feel terrible . . . the waves lapping at the sides of the boat , the motor chugging , the little boy whimpering . . . ' She paused . Then abruptly she remembered Miss Hedwig and what she had said . ' Enjoyedit ! Misery , that 's what it was for me ! ' Miss Hedwig squinted and looked narrowly at the shadowy form of her sister . She felt a vague unhappiness then , but again , weakly remonstrated : In our childhood  --  why , there were many happy occasions then , many things to remember . On winter mornings we would run down into the kitchen in our flannel nightgowns , with the wood in the stove just starting to burn , and thick , white streams of smoke curling out of the cracks on the stove top , and cook would dress us as we stood shivering on chairs . Our stockings were held up by circular bands of black elastic . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all sorts , and once you got sick from too much lemonade and peanuts . Then there was the time when I fell in the mill race and almost drowned , and was saved by a branch hanging over the water , which I managed to cling to somehow . And we were the first girls in the village to have bicycles , called them wheels , then , and had special wheeling clothes . Why , there are a hundred things like that , all precious to remember . We had youth ! ' Precious ! That 's what 's so bitter ! Those things  --  they 're all we have got . Trivial , trivial . . . nothing at all . And precious because there 's nothing else ! ' Miss Hedwig sat silent . There was a pause . She could hear her sister 's breathing . Then she saw her raise her handkerchief to her nose and sniffle into it . The room was darker . They could hardly see each other . Vaguely the silver still gleamed , but now the faces of the sisters were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's dark . ' Miss Amelia sniffled . Not yet , ' she said . Wait , ' p 102 Miss Hedwig looked out through the windows at the scatteredstars twinkling palely through the trees , until at last the street-light on the corner went on , and Miss Amelia 's face was clearer to see again . But Miss Amelia did not seem to feel that the light fell on her , for she sat on , staring as if unseeingbefore her , her mouth still half opened . Suddenly she spoke again . She said , No . Turn on no lights . I 'm going to tell you something . I 've never mention edit to you . It has always shamed me . But not now . It was my chance . It would have given me something now . Listen You remember Burk Haydon ? He was the town rake . Mother shuddered when his name was mentioned . To me he was rather repulsive . Except once . Oily and sleek , dark hair plastered down , a moustache . . . . You must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and disappeared . I never heard him mentioned since . But that was Burk Haydon  --  tall , always dressed too carefully , too jauntily and loudly for a man , with a flower in his buttonhole , and a kind of knowing sneer on his mouth . His mouth was heavy and cruel , his lips always wet . I have a clear remembrance of him though it is years now that he 's gone . One night  --  I was about nineteen  --  I met him on a dark street . Quite suddenly . I was startled . He stopped and talked . We knew each other , of course , but we had never talked . I remember his voice , too . It was soft with something insinuating in it , something knowing . I shivered a little when he looked at me . As though he looked through all my clothes . I had felt that before , times when he just passed me on the street , looked at me for just a second . But on that night he stopped me , spoke to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could walk home with me . I said of course . He turned and walked by my side.  |p103He  held my arm as we walked . I felt his fingers on my arm . When we came to the park he stopped . He said that he wanted to talk to me , that I should come in the park with him and sit down for a while and talk . The park had its reputation then , just as it has now . I knew at once what he meant . I refused and started to walk on . Then he seized my arm . His fingers pressed it hard in their grip . He stopped me again and I saw his eyes and I heard him say then  --  and I know I was n't dreaming  --  that I was beautiful . I was frightened . I think I laughed at him , from fright , though . But I knew how he lied . I was not beautiful . I was not even attractive . Neither of us ever was , Hedwig . I knew he lied . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he held me there with his eyes , and then , in the shadows , he seized me and for a moment held me tight in his arms , and then I screamed , so that he let me go , and I ran , and ran until I came home , and then had to sit outside on the back porch for a long time until I was calm enough to come into the house , and then for days I was not really calm , could not forget how there for a moment he held me tight in his arms and how I screamed . I was ashamed , and I could not forget . ' There was a pause . Miss Hedwig did not comment , made no movement . Miss Amelia looked at her hands in her lap . In the dim light from the street , her face was agitated , her full breast rising and falling with her agitation . Then suddenly she looked at Miss Hedwig , her face tortured . I was a fool ! Ashamed ! I should have been proud ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean it . If I had gone with him  --  well , I would n't be like this now . I 'm sorry I did n't go . I 'd have something now . You will say that that could n't have made me happier . But I know that it could . You will say that it was n't lovely . No . It was ugly . But an ugly thing , too , could be remembered . Yes , and I would have known that he did n't care for me ,  |p1o4  that he would never have paid me another moment 's thought . I would know it now , too . It would have been brutal , but even that would be enough for me now . The fact would remain . In this terrible twilight I could remember that fact . You will say that I would n't want to remember it . But I would . I know I would . It would have put me into life ! ' She paused . Her breathing was loud in the room . Then she went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now Miss Hedwig was not hearing , was rising slowly from her chair , like a person arising in a dream , was gripping the arms of her chair , her napkin dropping unnoticed to the floor as she stood up thin and tall in the dark room , lost to the room , something triumphant in her figure , something strong and heedless and triumphant . Burk Haydon ? Miss Hedwig thought with a start . Rememberhim ! But why is she talking about him ? She 's never mentioned him before . Can she know ? Can she ? No  --  how she describes him , with what clear remembrance  --  the flower in his buttonhole  --  his mouth , heavy and cruel , the wet lips . How clear he is to her ! As clear as he is to me . But what is she coming to ? It is n't that she knows , she ca n't . For she describes him with tenderness , or fascination , or something like it , though she can hardly know that it 's there in her voice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he stopped her and talked to her . His eyes pierced her clothes , saw her naked . I remember his eyes , remember how they burned , how my skin burned under their gaze . He walked with her . He took her arm and held it . She felt his fingers . He stopped at the park ! When he said I was beautiful as we stood there under the trees , in the darkness , I felt his strength . My mind knewp105that he was lying , that I was not beautiful or very attractive , but my blood did not know . I stood there limp with fright and he stood so close to me that his strength leapt across the gap between us and was in my blood , and I felt as I had never felt before , was mad . And when he took me in his arms suddenly , seized me and held me close and breathed his flattery on my face , I could not move , I had no muscles , no bones , was his completely , and let him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if commanded by a power . I could not fight and did not wish to . We did not talk . We sat in the grass and his arms were around me and my fright disappeared and I was mad there . In one short moment I thought of jumping to my feet and fleeing , but the moment passed and his mouth , heavy and cruel , was on mine and I had no will at all , was like someone else under his hands . The rest was terrible . I ran home alone . He did not follow me . When Amelia came home , she is saying , she sat outside for a long time . So did I. Later I went to my room alone , avoided Amelia and mother , and all that night I lay awake , frightened to death , ashamed to death . She says that she was ashamed . Why should she have been ? It was I who had to be ashamed , who could not look into anyone 's eyes for days , who faltered whenever I met Burk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he finally left town , and only then could be myself again . But what she has said can not be true . She is silent now , and it can not really be , what she has said . She has said nothing , and all this while I have been dreaming . It can not be . Proud , she is saying . Proud/ She should have been proud ? But listen  --  it is n't , it ca n't be Amelia talking ! Sorry ? ... Have something now ? I will say that it could n't make her happier now ? I will say that it was n't lovely ? I will say that she would n't want to remember it now ?  | Slowly , then , Miss Hedwig arose from her chair , arose like a woman dreaming , stood erect in the dark room , her head thrown back , her body straight , strong and heedless and triumphant . Miss Amelia 's quiet talking lapsed into a sigh , and presentlyshe looked up at Miss Hedwig . I should n't have told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criticizing me for it now , are n't you ? For daring to suggest that I was wrong in running from him . I should n't have told you , Hedwig . But that is what I feel . I ca n't help it . ' Miss Hedwig stood stiffly erect , breathing heavily now too . Her eyes looked far beyond the room . What 's wrong with you , Hedwig ? ' Miss Amelia cried suddenly . Are you angry ? ' She stood up and came slowly to her sister 's side . She touched her arm softly . Do n't be angry , Hedwig . After all , I did n't go with him . Maybe I 'm wrong in saying that I should have . It 's age , Hedwig . It 's this awful twilight that comes every night , this emptiness , this nothing . Forgive me ! ' Miss Amelia began to weep in her handkerchief . Miss Hedwig relaxed a little . She looked down on Miss Amelia as she cringed by her side , weeping for the emptiness of her life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a faint smile , pitying and superior . You poor thing , Amelia , ' she said . Stop crying . I 'm not angry . Stop crying and turn on the lights . I 'll take the tea things out . It 's high time we had supper . Come on , now , Amelia , stop it ! ' Miss Amelia sniffled into her handkerchief . She blew her nose and walked across the room . Miss Hedwig 's eyes fol/lowed her . She shook her head pityingly and thought , the poor thing , the poor thing ! My years of shame were mistaken . She 's right ! She should be sorry ! An ugly brutal thing is enough ! I was put into life !  | IT BOTHERED THE MAN . He had to sit there in his car waiting , and it made him nervous . He kept trying to look away , to look at the street and the shop windows , but he could not keep his eyes turned away . He had a feeling that he was not seeing the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it made him feel that something was wrong . The boy had a stick in his hands , a mop handle or the sawed-off end of an old broom . But the man could not tell what he was hitting with it , or if he was hitting anything but the ground . The boy was kneeling just inside the opening of a wooden fence made by a couple of missing boards , and the man could see only the part of the stick that he had in his hands . But he could see that the boy 's hands were clenched tight on the stick , and he could see the funny , dead-pan expression on the boy 's face as , almost methodically , he kept lifting the stick and letting it fall , over and over , with no change of expression . It got so that the man almost thought he could hear the thump that the stick made . He looked away again . All right , it was a kid with a stick . So what ? He looked at the jammed-up , dusty store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him at the narrowing structure of the elevated as it gradually came to a point many blocks away . The place had the air of uncanny emptinessthat out-of-the-way streets in a city have on Sunday afternoons , and the man wanted to get away from there . Ap109train suddenly roared overhead ; but the sound died away almost at once , and he was alone in the block with that kid again . After a while a taxi shot by , and then another car more slowly , and then the block was empty again . The man leaned out of the window of his car and looked up at the side of the building where he was parked , at the dirty lace curtainsheavily drawn over the windows , and the windows shut tight , and the structure of the elevated seeming to press against the building , throwing its checkered shadow on the faded red brick walls in the pale sunlight . Come on , let 's get going , he thought ; but still the man he was waiting for did not come out of the building . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street , at the opening in the fence , at the boy kneeling there on the ground , lifting the stick in his clenched hands , and letting it fall . Thump , it seemed to go , and the man knew that he was not seeing the whole thing . Suddenly he opened the car door , got out , and started to walk rapidly across the street . The boy heard his heels on the pavement and looked up sharply , and for a moment the stick stopped moving , in midair . Then , still looking at the man as he came nearer , the boy let the stick come down very slowly , let it drop without any force , and raised it again . The man stood before the opening in the fence staring at the boy , and the stick came down . The man heard the soft noise it made , and he looked inside . It was no surprise to see a dead dog lying there , its sides flattened out by the perpetual drummingof the stick . Why , you ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made the boy 's dark , empty eyes blink in his soiled , white face . He tossed his head to get the hair out of his eyes , and without looking at the dog now , he kept lifting the stick and letting it fall as he stared . He was ten or eleven years old , a very thin kid , and he had an old red sweater with half-unraveled sleeves , ragged pantsp110that came to his knees , no stockings , and a pair of shoes with holes in the bottoms . The man could see his bare feet through the holes . The close sight of the boy , alone in the bare lot , with the blind backs of closed up buildings all around him , made the man hesitate . And that mangy little dog on the ground , dead , flattened out .. . He pulled himself together and said , Why , you little rat ! Why 'd you kill that dog ? ' The stick went up and down , and the boy looked at the dog . I did n't kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scram ? ' What do you mean , you did n't kill him ? What are you doing there anyway ? ' What 's it to ya ? ' Again the man hesitated . It could not be right , he was missing something . The methodical way that the boy went at it , over and over , without much force but with almost mechanical relentlessness . It made the man feel sick , and he said , Why do n't you go play with the kids ? ' What kids ? ' The kids around here . There must be kids around here . ' What kids ? ' Why do n't you get away from that dog ? What do you want to worry that dead dog for ? Why do n't you let it alone ? ' What 's it to ya ? ' the boy asked , tossing his head again . Whenever he bent forward , his straight black hair fell across his forehead and hung in his eyes . What 's it to me ? Why , you ... ' ' Well ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's voice seemed loud to him in the empty block . He 's my dog . Why do n't ya scram ? ' The roar of the elevated was almost a relief , but again the sound died away , and the man said , Why 'd you kill it ? What made you do it ? '  |p111Nuts  , ' the boy said , and looked back at the dog . Where 's your old man ? ' How should I know ? ' the boy asked without looking up . Where 's your ma ? ' The boy did not answer . Do n't you know any kids around here ? Where do you live ? ' The boy tossed his head , and the lick of hair fell back beside his ear . If it 's your dog , why do you want to hit it ? Why did you want to kill it ? ' I did n't kill him , you bastard ! ' the boy cried . Do n't you go calling . . . ' He pulled his arm back to cuff the kid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his knees , crouching away from the man 's hand . Aw , I 'm not going to hurt you , ' the man said . Honest , I did n't kill him . ' Who did ? ' The boy looked at the dog and said , The damn fool ran out in the street and got run over . ' You 're lying . ' He should 've known better . Why 'd he wan na do it for ? He did know better . ' You 're lying . ' Nuts . ' He picked up the stick which he had dropped and almost idly tapped the dog with the end of it . Cut that out , ' the man said . Why do n't you go home ? Why do n't you go play with the other kids ? ' And then , suddenlyoutraged , For God 's sake , cut that out or I 'll call a cop . ' The boy only said , He 's mine , see ? I c'n do what I want with him , see ? ' And , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog . The man felt sick at the sound and reached out to seizep112the boy by the neck , but then he heard someone across the street call Hey ! ' to him , and he turned round and saw that it was the man he was waiting for . He straightened up . The boy had not noticed his anger . He was striking methodically at the dog , a little more forcefully with each blow . The man started to speak again , but then turned away . He felt helpless , caught in something he was missing . But as he stepped toward the curb , away from the fence , he heard the boy 's thin voice , and he turned round again . He saw the boy still kneeling on the hard ground , alone in the empty lot with the dead dog , the two of them made minute by the grimy buildings that seemed suddenly to tower all around the lot ; but now the white face was intense with effort and pain , and the boy was hitting the dog as hard as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost yelling , God damn you , Jack ! Oh , God damn you ! ' The anguish made the man hurry away , made him walk as fast as he could without running.  | THE LITTLE GIRLS were having tea in the garden , sittingrather primly , rather stiffly , at their table in the shadow of the blooming syringas . Their white dresses were bright in the sunlight against the lush green of the garden ; and the little girls were very careful how they sat lest they wrinkle their dresses . They kept smoothing out their short skirts precisely over their bare legs and fluffing up their short puffed sleeves . Finally one of them said , I 'm tired of this tea . It 's only lemonade anyway , Margie ! ' Why , Ellen Carson ! It is not ! Have you ever had tea ? ' No , but I 've had lemonade ! There is n't anything like yellow tea ! There 's only green and black . ' There is so , Ellen Carson , and this is it ! ' Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small cup away , looked with great weariness at the fragments of dry toast on her plate , and glanced gloomily at Margie . All right for you , ' said Margie , and she poured herself another cupful . There 's Jesse , ' said Ellen . The cat came slowly from behind the house and walked around the tea table , then wound itself through the thickly grown base of a syringa bush , shaking the stalks . Some blossomsexploded with small popping noises and the petals dropped down to the table and the ground . Jesse stretched himself in the shadow and rolled over on his back in the dirt.  |p114Give  Jesse some tea , then ! ' Ellen cried . If it is tea , he 'll drink it . My grandmother 's cat does . If he does n't , it 's lemonade . ' All right , ' said Margie . Come here , Jesse . ' The cat lifted its head and looked at her . Come , Jesse , Jesse , Jesse , ' she called , pouring her saucer full . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tail , and Margie put the saucer on the ground . The cat sniffed at the saucer with delicate scorn and went slowly back to the shadows and stretched out again . There ! ' cried Ellen triumphantly . I told you , Margie Davis ! ' Jesse drinks milk , naturally ! Only a queer cat would drink tea . You have n't proved a thing ! ' Ellen said stiffly , My grandmother 's cat is not queer . ' With mild conciliation in her voice , Margie said , But most cats do drink milk , Ellen . You know they do . ' Ellen dismissed the matter abruptly . Oh , let 's play some-thing . ' What ? ' We could play having cocktails . ' My mother and father have cocktails every night , and I can pour them ! ' That 's nothing . When my father has lunch at home , he and mother have them at noon . There ! ' My father 's a professor , ' said Margie , and he 's got a black gown and a square hat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ellen . That 's nothing . My father 's a lawyer , and he 's got a gown and a square hat too , and a red and blue thing for around his neck besides , and he never wears any of them at all because he does n't care about them ! ' Margie said , But lawyers do n't have anything to wear them to , silly ! ' That just shows how much you know , ' said Ellen with a fine scorn . They do so wear them , if they warn ' to ! '  |p115Well  , to what ? ' All sorts of things . ' No , they do n't , ' said Margie wisely . Yes they do . ' No . ' Yes . ' No , I said ! ' ' Ye-es . ' Margie ! ' her father suddenly called from an upstairs window . Margie looked up at him , his head poked out of the window . Find your mother , ' he said . I 've cut myself . ' Oh ! ' said Margie . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Margie glanced at Ellen . Excuse me , ' she said with preciseimportance and rose from the table . She ran round the corner of the house to the terrace where her mother was reading in a deck chair . Mummy , Father 's cut himself and wants you , ' she announced . Oh , dear ! ' said her mother . She pulled a hairpin from her head and put it in the place in her book , then hurried into the house and upstairs . Margie followed quietly behind her . She looked into her father 's study through the crack in the door and saw her mother 's head bent over her father 's hand . Then she saw blood on the floor . She stared at the blood for a moment before she ran down the stairs and out again . She stood beside Ellen breathlessly and said , There 's blood all over the floor . ' It must be bad ! ' It 's very bad ! ' Margie said . Then Ellen stood up , and both of them stared at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Margie 's mother came around into the garden with her hat on . She said , Margie , your father 's cut his hand rather badly , and I 'm going to drive him to the hospital . We 'll be gone only a short time . '  | Oh , is it bad ? ' He 'll be all right as soon as the doctor ties it up . You 'll be a good girl , wo n't you , Margie ? ' Yes , mummy . ' And do n't wander off the grounds , either of you . ' They watched her disappear round the corner , and then they listened to the motor being started , and heard the sound die away on the street . They 've gone , ' said Ellen . You stay here Ellen , ' Margie said quickly . I 'll be right back . ' Oh , Margie , where you going ? ' You wait , I 'll be right back . ' Oh , Margie , where  --  what . . . ? ' Ellen looked dismayed . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back of the house . She went in cautiously and tiptoed up the stairs . Carefully she pushed open the door of her father 's study and looked in . No one was there . She walked into the room without making a sound and looked at the spot of blood on the floor and at the blotches of it on the papers scattered over the desk . Open on the floor , with a stripe of blood on the blade , lay the sharp knife with which her father sharpenedhis pencils and cut the pages of his books . Then Margie saw what was beside it . For a moment she stared at it , startled and unbelieving . It was the tip of her father 's finger , the very top of the tip . She knelt down and looked at it closely for a long time , and at last she picked it up and laid it gingerly in the palm of her hand . She closed her hand over it slowly , as if over a treasure of some sort , and then turned and ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and out again . Guess what I 've got , ' she said . What ? ' Guess . ' I give up . ' Oh , guess ! '  |p117I  ca n't , Margie , I give up . ' Margie opened her hand triumphantly . What is it ? ' Ellen asked . Silly , it 's what my father cut off from his finger ! ' Oh , ' said Ellen , staring at it . They looked at it in silence for a long time , until at last Ellen said , There 's a piece of his nail on it . He must have cut right through his nail . ' Of course he did . It 's a very bad cut . He 's had to go to the hospital , has n't he ? ' Ellen touched the bloody thing in Margie 's hand with the end of her finger and then drew back quickly . What 's the matter ? ' asked Margie . Nothing . ' Ellen touched it again . Then suddenly she said , Give it to me , Margie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give it to me , and then I 'll show you . ' What for ? ' Margie 's hand began to draw back and close over it . Give it to me and I 'll show you , ' Ellen said slowly , exasperated . ' No . ' Come on , Margie . I want to show you something . ' What ? ' Well , give it to me ! ' No . ' Oh , Margie Davis ! You make me mad ! ' Ellen cried . Then , Come Jesse , Jesse , Jesse . ' The cat crept out from under the syringas and looked at them . Margie looked at the cat and then quickly back at Ellen . Then she let out a scream of delight . Oh , I know ! ' Forgetting her clean dress , Margie fell quickly to her knees and stretched out her hand . Come , Jesse , Jesse , Jesse , ' she crooned . The cat lifted its head and sniffed the air , then ran swiftly toward Margie 's sticky open palm  |p118That  's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought of it first and you 're a mean thing , Margie Davis , and I 'm going right home ! ' Margie , engrossed in the precise movement of Jesse 's jaws , did not look up . Nor did Ellen move . She watched Jesse , too . And in the green garden , in the sharp sunlight and shadow , their fluffy white dresses looked as bright and tidy as the blossoms on the syringas.  | IT WAS a quiet , shady street , on a Sunday afternoon , and the houses , set back on long lawns , looked closed up , deserted . A few people were walking on the street , under the trees , and some children were playing in an empty lot next to a small apartment building . A car passed me , and just then a dog ran out into the street , and the front wheels of the car hit it . The car did not stop , and by the time I had stopped mine it had disappeared round a corner . The old man who had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bent over a little , looking down at the dog where it had been thrown in the gutter . The children stopped their playing and drew nearer , and a man and woman paused on the sidewalk behind the old man and stared at him curiously for a moment , said something to each other , and went on , looking back at him over their shoulders . I got out and started to walk toward him , and then he did a curious thing . He bent over and fastened the leash which he had in his hand onto the collar of the dead dog . I was beside him when he straightened up , but he did not look at me . He was looking down at the animal and pulling at the leash with insistent little tugs , as if he thought that the dog might be persuaded to come along . It was perfectly clear that the dog was dead . He was a very old man who had behaved as a child would behave in the same situation , pretending in the face of catastrophe that no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was trembling with shock and grief , with the knowl/edge of what had happened . I was afraid that he might toppleover , so I said , Sit down here and I 'll bring my car closer , ' and helped him to a sitting position on the curb . Still he said nothing , still had not even looked at me . He sat staring at the dog , with the leash shaking in his hand . The children had moved into the middle of the street , where the three of them stood in a line and stared . One of them suddenly began a shrill crying , She 's dead ! She 's dead ! ' and ran back to the sidewalk across the street . The others followed , and then they all ran into the middle of the street and circled back again , all crying in a shrill , excited chorus , She 's dead ! ' I was going to tell them to be quiet , but then I saw that the old man did not hear even their racket . I walked back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I drove up to where he was and got out again . I touched his shoulder and said , Tell me what I can do . Where do you live ? ' He looked up at me with watering eyes , and then down at the dog again , and said , She 's dead . Cissy 's dead . ' He said it with something like awe in his voice , with a child 's frightened incredulity . He was trembling more than ever , utterly confused , really sick with fright and shock , and , of course , grief for his dog . And again he said , Cissy 's dead , ' as if he had to restate the fact to himself if he was to understand it . I 'll put the dog in the back , and you get in the front with me , ' I said . I bent over the dog and was about to unfasten the leash from the collar when he said , No , leave that on . Do n't take that off . ' I said , All right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' He handed me the end of the leash , and I picked up the dog . It was a wire-haired terrier with some Airedale in it , and overfed  --  not much of a dog as dogs go . And now it was heavy , sagging with the heavy limpness of newly dead ani/mals , and a trickle of blood was drying on its muzzle . I picked it up and put it on the floor in the back of the car , and rolled up the trailing leash . From his seat on the curb the old man watched me handle the dog , and when I had closed the back door and came toward him he said , Take me to 14 Stephens Street , will you ? ' I said , Yes . Let me help you in . ' He seemed now to have more or less taken in his situation , but he was not able to get to his feet . I helped him up and then had almost to lift him into the car . I could feel how frail he was , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had shattered what small strength he had . I went around and got in beside him and started the motor . Stephens Street 's only a few blocks from here , ' I said . I 'll have you home in a moment . ' As we started off , the three children , who were standing quietly on the other curb now , staring , began their high screaming again : She 's dead ! She 's dead ! ' The old man looked at the fixtures on the door of the car and said , May I have some air ? ' I ran down the window on his side . Then he said , I 'm not well . I 've been sick for five years  --  not feeling quite well . ' I 'm sorry . You 'll be all right now , wo n't you , until you get home ? ' He breathed quickly , as if to get as much of the fresh air into his lungs as he could , and said , You 'll see that I get home ? It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' and drove a little faster . His hands , which he held gripped together in his lap , were clean and well-kept . White hair hung in neat wisps under the upturned brim of his black hat , and he had a carefully tended white beard . His clothes were black , clean , and a little worn . Altogether , he looked like a retired professor , like a man who had grown old in gentle surroundings and a pleasant profession.  | We turned into Stephens Street . I would have placed him somewhere else . Stephens Street was deserted , drab , without trees . The packed rows of houses with their blank windows seemed two-dimensional . Number 14 Stephens Street was exactly like the houses on either side of it . This is it , is n't it ? ' He looked out at the building and said nothing , and except for his trembling , which had not abated , he did not move . I live with my daughter-in-law , ' he said finally . My son 's dead . It 's her house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light , a tall frame structure painted a shade of tan which reflected the sunlight in a solid glare . It was obviously a three-flat arrangement , with ugly dark interiors , and grim people . My son 's been dead for four years , ' he said . I 'll take you in , ' I said . He looked at me with his sorrowing eyes as if he were asking a question , and I thought I answered the question when I said , Yes , I 'll carry the dog in . ' I helped him out , but instead of moving toward the house with me he clung to the open door of the car and looked down into the back where his dog lay with the leash on her collar . What shall I tell my daughter-in-law ? ' he asked in his quavering tones . Well , Cissy 's yours , after all , ' I said . His voice turned a little shrill . Oh , no ! No ! ' he cried . She 's always told me  --  she 's told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leash ! I knew it , I knew it  --  I was told And then suddenly he let go of the door and sat down heavily on the running board , and I saw that he was looking at me not with grief at all , but with absolute , quaking terror . It was the terror of a child who knows the punishment ahead . I looked at the bare front of the house , and for a moment I had an impulse not to take him in there at all . But of course there was nothing else to do.  | THE ACCIDENT took place on a foggy evening , at about six o'clock , just outside the city , and very near one of the big municipal hospitals . It was no time at all before the ambulance had picked up the patient , who was unconscious , and had her in the hospital . In the operating room her eyelids began to flutter , and the attending surgeon , an elderly man , ordered ether . Keep her under , ' he said . This looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to handle the pelvis . I do n't want to touch it , and there 's plenty to'keep me busy . Checked the heart action ? ' Abnormally slow . ' Adrenalin . ' The fluttering eyelids of the patient opened wide just before the ether mask covered her face . In her condition , she submitted to the anaesthetic without struggle , in fact , as it seemed , eagerly .. . ... you might have been under the sea . The trees had lost the spininess of earth , had been turned to veils which undulatedgently and with infinite luxuriance in the slow currents that ceaselessly brush across the incalculable bottom of the sea . It was late afternoon , and there was a green light in the air still which intensified this sense of a submarine world , and only the greenness saved vegetation from monstrous appearances . And somewhere the sun was shining curiously , and sending strange , horizontal beams of pink and yellow light through the thickness , rays which died in the very act ofp124penetrating the fragile , inexorable barrier of fog , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cut like spears , sheared like knives , grated cruelly like bone splintered in the thighs , the stomach and the chest , the very head and brain . And yet the fog saved her from the ultimate , grinding pain , blurred things softly , and let pain swim in almost dreamlike waves against her , as she herself swam dreamlike , boneless , in the fog , in the remote depths of water . Then out of the billowing gray a voice began to come . Back her up , ' it said flatly , distantly at first . Back her up , back her up , back her up . There you are , there you are , there you are . ' Through what immeasurable depths of ocean did this familiarrepetition of sounds float ? Back her up , back her up , back her up . ' The cold and metal voice , the dying , dropping sound ? Back her up , back her up , back her up , ' and , There you are , there you are , there you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew , a voice which made no effort to lift itself above the steady , monotonous hum of motors which was like the deadened roar of waves on a distant beach , yet effortlessly detached itself from the whole background of throbbing sound and flatly said , Back her up , back her up , back her up . ' The voice was empty of everything but metal words , no fear , no pity , no dread of catastrophe , no love of it either , was catastrophe itself , articulate and cold : Back her up , back her up , back her up . ' In the glistening , slightly tilted mirror she saw behind her how , in that subaqueous world , a corridor appeared , empty and cold and infinite , its narrowing length beyond the power of the mirror to tell , but infinite , infinite , white and gleaming and cruelly empty , endless as it narrowed down to a point no eye could truly find , stretching endlessly through the gray , green , billowing world . And , Back her up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice relentlessly said over the rising roar . Then , as dread accumulated and mingled with the alreadyp125experienced pain , these two illogically mixed , the fear and the fact which was feared ; then , as all the motion of the world took on both violence and order , the green fog swirling now into patterned arrangements of wheels and wheels and wheels , and the rays of curious sunlight suddenly swinging up , much brighter , as from points of earth , and wheeling out in patternedrevolutions piercing the fog but never finding sky ; then , as all sound came together in the powerful and helpless drone of one motor , and that somewhere above , lost in the depths , and for which the lights made their vain and ordered search  --  then , fixing her glance with sober frenzy on the mirror in which the endless corridor stood askew , she began to back , back , back , first fearfully , and slowly as the voice was slow , then , as gradually it spoke more rapidly , terrorized , and faster , faster , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with such terrific speed that she knew that she was no longer driving it , but that it was compelled , pulled back by space itself , the magnet of space fixed on the helpless objectof time , which now charged back and back and back , as still the voice said , Back her up , back her up , back her up , ' and dread became an unendurable ecstasy of suspense . And then abruptly the voice changed , and it was the old man 's voice , quavering and uncertain , yet speaking the same words ; and as the machine flew ever backwards , the old man himself appeared , a crazy , yellow figure dancing like fury before her , down the limitless corridor , forever down , and always faster , faster , faster . But with the change in the voice , dread dissipateditself , and now she was laughing at the joke , and the old man , dancing in his painful fury before her , laughed too , with the toothless gums in his yellow , ancient face . And then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air , the machine lifted itself from the ground , from the corridor , from the old man , was in the fog itself , and , in the revolving lights , found its own orbit at last . Then there was once more the infinite luxury of submarine motion in her body , and all pain was gone ; only the undulation of the orbit itself , in the bright light , as the light went ever out and out into space , and the orbit with it , the marvelous magnetized arc in space which held her , orbit in space dipping , dropping , rising , falling , out , out , out into the darker air , the sound of the motor above fainter and fainter , the voice retreating , retreating , a vast silence preparing itself for the secret she was to learn at last out here , in space unendurably cold yet not felt as cold , as the orbit was graying , then was lost , and fog lost , sea lost , sound lost , voice lost , only cold and black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfortably moved . The mask was lifted from the face . Under , ' said the attendant . Observe the heart action closely , ' said the surgeon to the nurse . A young man , black eyes alert above his mask , came into the brilliant , shining room . Hello , Carver , ' said the older man , and with his glittering instrument he indicated the patient 's pelvic region . The young man grunted and glanced briefly at the patient 's face . Quite suddenly , and , as it seemed , not curiously , she was on solid earth again , in a familiar world . Her hard heels struck sharply on the sidewalk as she went rapidly down the street from her mother 's house to the garage where she kept her car . It was a late September afternoon heavy with fog , and she was anxious to get to the airport where , she knew , Dave was soon going to make a landing that would not be easy . He would not be pleased to see her there again , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , over the most terrificinsults to your pride , got over your pride itself when you were really put to it . She pushed the heavy garage doors apart and slid in through the aperture . Ether Voice was scraping spark plugs at the repair bench . Hi , ' she said.  |p127Hello  , Miss Walton . Going out ? ' Yes . ' It 's a bad afternoon . ' Not too bad . ' Pop 'll help you out . ' The old man was beside her , bobbing up and down a little , his zany 's grin on his parchment face . Hello , ' she said to him , and , smiling to herself , walked back along the rows of cars to her own , with the old man limping along behind her . Sometimes she wondered why the old man amused her so , what it was about an old man with yellow skin , no teeth to speak of and one foot in the grave , that was funny . Most people would pity him , she supposed , so old , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not any too warm and cozy in winter , sleeping in a chair through long winter nights in the drab , concrete office , which is what he had to do when he was on night duty , and that was most nights , because his son had to get real sleep to run the place in the daytime when the real work was done . It was that he was both so old and always so foolishly chipper that was funny . She was fond of him , as one might be of someone mildly defective , and she had a pet name for him , and one for his son , too . To herself she called the father Old Death , and what an archaic clown he was ! The other , because of his flat , monotonous voice , like the emotionless voices one hears under anaesthetic , she called Ether Voice . Their real names she did not know . She edged her way through the narrow space between her car and the next and climbed in behind the wheel . The old man stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , prepared to signal her to come ahead . She started the motor , glanced at him , smiled , and heard him say in his high , croaking voice , All right , bring her out , bring her out , bring her out . ' His bony old hand beckoned her in a circular motion . She put the machine in gear and let it move slowly ahead . Almost at once it scraped up against the fender of the car on the right . She pulled on her brake and stopped short . The old man was grinning helplessly and shaking his head , and Ether Voice , who had looked up sharply , came toward them at a run . By God , Pop , you got ta watch what you 're doin ' ! ' he said in his metallic voice , from which one could not have known that he was angry . I thought them wheels was straight , ' the old man wheezed . Okay , ' said Ether Voice , and , looking up at her , Half our profits the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ta repair . He ca n't get a car in and he ca n't get it out without somethin ' . ' She put her head down on the steering wheel and laughed . Every time , ' she cried , every time ! He does n't miss a chance ! ' Something in these little accidents , these parodies of catastrophe for which the old man was always responsible , seemed almost unbearably amusing to her ; now she was laughing so hard that tears came to her eyes . It ai n't funny any more , ' Ether Voice said , and looked briefly at the old man who stood there grinning , ashamed of his ancient incompetence , and , with his good foot , kicking at a post like a schoolboy . All right , Miss Walton , ' Ether Voice said . Turn your wheels sharp and back her up . ' She put the car into reverse and straightened the wheels . All right , back her up , ' he said in his flat tone , his hand waving her back . Go on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are . ' She was about to move the car forward again when they heard the telephone in the office ringing loudly . Wait , ' said Ether Voice , till I answer that . ' He trotted up to the front of the garage , disappeared , and in a moment came back again . It 's your mother . Wants to know if her daughter is here . Wants you to come home a minute . '  |p129Oh  Christ ! ' she said . Ether Voice said , All right , now . Bring her out , bring her out . ' Slowly she edged the car out of its space , and then swung it round to face the doors , which the old man was straining to open . Ether Voice walked along beside the car and said , Now take it easy , Miss Walton . It 's bad driving . ' Okay , ' she said , and , waving to the two of them , slid out into the gray-pink fog . Once she had heard him say to the old man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' eatin ' at her , ' and she could remember the old man 's meaninglessgrin which almost suggested relish . And now , in her impatience , she pressed her foot hard on the gas and drove the few blocks to her home swiftly , recklessly through the mist , pulled up in front of the house with a jerk , jumped out , slammed the door , and ran up the steps . She went directly to the sitting room where she knew her mother would be , and there she was , sitting heavily in the firelight on a little settee which she seemed to crowd , a decanter of sherry and two glasses on the table before her , her fat legs stuck rather ridiculously out , the great knees apart , and her little hands folded tidily in her lap . Something in the neat arrangement of waves in her mother 's hair , something about the genteel gray hair itself , so well-kept and glistening in the firelight , outraged her. 1 ' What is it ? ' Her mother smiled with studied patience . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her hat . Well , what ? ' Sit down . ' Impatiently she sat down on the edge of a chair . What ? ' Darling , you 're looking lovely . That blue , fuzzy wool becomes you  --  your eyes , and your hair . It makes your hair positively yellow ! I like it combed down that way . Makes you look like fifteen . ' Come on , mother , what is it ? '  |p130Do  n't always be so sharp , dear . It 's only that when I saw that you 'd gone out , without saying anything , I was worried . That 's all . Where were you going ? ' For heaven 's sake ! ' ' I 'm serious , Marge . Do take off your hat . Have a glassof sherry with me . Be my daughter for a change . ' What rot . Come on , mother , what do you want ? ' Her mother hesitated , and then , in a helpless little voicewhich was comic in a woman so heavy , she cried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tell me . What is it ? ' If you did n't have a pretty good idea , you would n't be worried . ' No , Marge . Just your driving . That 's enough to worry me enormously . ' What about my driving ? I like to drive , that 's all . I like machinery . I like to make it go . ' But you 're so reckless . ' Anybody who knows how to handle a car ca n't be reckless . Now what is it , really ? ' Her mother bent over and poured sherry into the glasses . Here , dear , ' she said . I do n't like the stuff , thanks . ' Mrs. Walton sipped at her glass . Well , there is more than your driving , then . You have n't always been this way . So  --  nervous , distraught . So abrupt with me . ' Oh , I 'm sorry . But look , I am in a hurry . May I go now ? ' Where are you going ? ' You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes . To see Dave Roberts make a landing . ' That man . ' ' A good man , ma . Too good for me , I guess . ' What do you mean ? You , who have every opportunity . Think of the expense to which I went to educate you , then to bring you out properly , and now you wo n't have anythingp131to do with your own kind of men . Or the girls , for that matter . ' Bores , mother . The most terrific bores , all of them . I ca n't stand them . I 'm sorry about the expense , but it was never I who wanted to come out . Or any of the rest of it . ' But that man  --  that Roberts ! ' Marge stood up . Get something straight , mother , ' she said . I 'm in love with him . In love ? No . Crazy . I 'd give anything to get him . Anything . You 're right . Something is wrong . I 'm slightly crazy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lacy teagown fell about her short legs in heavy folds , shrouded her dainty feet . Marge , stop ! I wo n't listen to this from you . I wo n't , I tell you . ' You asked for it , ' Marge said quietly . Do you mean to marry this man ? ' She laughed . Marry ? Listen , a girl in my position does n't hold out for marriage . ' What are you talking about ? ' I mean he thinks I 'm so much dirt . ' ' Oh ! ' Her heavy shoulders hunched up in outrage , and her bosom rose and fell above her folded arms . It 's true . How about it ? Can I go now ? ' No . Sit down another moment . I want to tell you something . ' Mrs. Walton spoke quietly , with an effort . Well , what ? ' You know that I 've not had an easy life . Bringing up a child , always headstrong and increasingly so , and in all these last , difficult years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you no father . And now , Marge , do n't you see , this hurts doubly , because somehow it must be my fault . If your father had lived , if you had a father now who could talk to you , I 'm sureIt is n't a father I need . ' Mrs. Walton blinked rapidly . Marge , you wretched girl ! '  | Do n't I know it ? ' She waited to go , and as she stood she felt a sharp twinge of pain in her chest , or her bowels , and slowly , as she stood there , and the room began to fade from sight , it grew into a terrible pain in her whole body , a ripping , tearing pain , and as she cried out , she knew that what she said had never been said . Oh my God , mother , help me ! ' Mask ! Mask ! ' But her mother was already gone , had vanished in the mist which was swirling in the room , and the glow of the firelight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roar of a motor grew loud in her ears again , and it was suddenlyvery cold as she was driving faster and faster and faster until she was shrieking with terror , and shrieking a strange thing , something else she had never said , Father , help me , father , father ! ' But when at last , in the cold blackness , she was free of the car and found herself moving slowly out and out into the space beyond , where there were no longer any searchlights but only a few distant stars , or any sounds , or any pain , she moved with strange , compliant comfort , until she knew that in a moment she would have moved out of mind and into that knowledge toward which she yearned now in agony and joy . Okay . Way under . ' Pulse ? ' Dropping . ' Watch it . ' And then she was on the ground again , driving fast but safely , the fog heavier and the day a little darker , taking the last curve on the highway before she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharply , and coasting into the nearlyp133empty parking space . She pulled on the brake , jumped out , rushed into the brightly lighted , metallic place , and asked the first person she saw , Is Roberts down yet ? ' Coming down now , ma'am . ' She ran on down the shining corridor and out again , into the fog . She heard a droning motor above her in the mist , and she saw how all the sentinel lights were obscured on the ground in the deepening fog . The big searchlights were on , playing on the air , and in their powerful , barrel-like beams , the fog swirled in clouds . But the beams , even before they narrowed , were drowned , dissipated , blurred , unable to penetratefar the incredible murk . She glanced up at the controls tower where she could see the operators through the big windows , and she wished that she could get up there and listen to them bring him down , but she knew that they would prevent her . She clutched a moist , chromium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his motor as he circled the field . As she stood there , she had only one desire , to be up there with him , to feel what he was feeling , to know what it was like to identify so perfectly the will and the mechanism and make this mechanical triumph over these non-mechanical obstacles , and come down smoothly , sweeping onto the ground exactly as you had calculated , but never knowing that you were going to ; or not making the triumph , and come booming down from the soft , treacherous fog into the solid , smashing concrete as you had not calculated . The tension in either case was something which , even as she stood there on the earth , she could feel , she was certain , as powerfully as he , whose tension it was . She clutched the railing with both hands and strained her face upward . His motor now sounded farther away , then seemed to have stopped entirely , then picked up again with a sudden , near-by roar , and in the next moment she saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver machine through the fog like an obscure monster in a dream . She waited for him . When he came through the gate she stepped up to him . That was very neat , ' she exclaimed . He paused and stared at her . My God , ' he said . Again ! ' Sorry . ' She walked along the runway with him , trotting at his side to keep up with him , and into the bright interior . He stopped abruptly and turned to her , his face red with exasperation . Listen ' he said . Oh , do n't say it ! ' Well , good Lord ' I know , I know . Just do n't say it again . ' Now , listen  --  ' No , no , do n't . ' I 've got to report , ' he said . Okay . I 'll wait , ' she said , and watched him disappear up a little flight of metal stairs . Presently he came down again and , without speaking , walked by her into the restaurant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the leather-topped stools at the bar . Coffee , Marie , ' he said , pushing his pilot 's cap back on his head . Two . ' He turned and looked at her . What do you want , any-way ? ' Do n't be silly . ' Well , why do n't you give up ? No kidding , I 'm not inter-ested . ' Listen , Dave , ' she said , watching her fingers as she unwrappedone of the squares of sugar and dropped it into her coffee . I 'm not asking for much . I 'm not trying to involve you in anything . I know you do n't want to get mixed up with a woman . But you wo n't , do n't you see ? What I can give you , you probably pay for other places . And you 'd be just as free . '  |p135Jesus  , what a woman ! ' Well , why not ? Am I ugly ? What 's the matter with me ? Am I ugly ? Do I smell ? ' He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attractive , that you 've got everything a girl needs , including bucks . You got so much that you ought to have better things to do than chase me . ' She put down her cup . Sorry . I have n't . ' Well , why me ? ' he suddenly cried , so that the girl behind the counter heard and turned her bleached head sharply to stare at them . Why me ? ' he asked more softly . Why ? I do n't know . It just is you , that 's all . You just happen to be everything , see ? I do n't know why . Maybe it 's the way you can bring a plane down . Besides being so beau-tiful . ' He stared at her curiously . You know , you make me uncomfortable , ' he said , because I do n't think it 's me at all . It 's something else you 're after , something you got me mixed up with . Maybe just flying . Well , there are a lot of better fliers than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Girlish fancy about speed , or danger , or some-thing . ' Maybe , ' she said . But there it is . ' I ca n't accommodate . ' She paused . Look , there is something else . I 'm no tart , you know , if you happen to think so . ' He laughed briefly . She looked squarely into his dark eyes . Dave , ' she said , did n't you ever do anything you did n't want to do particularly ? Just to be generous ? Just to help someone out who was in a bad way ? Did n't you ? ' Sorry , ' he said , I got a girl , and I do n't want another . It just happens . Besides , she would n't like it . Which reminds me , I got a phone call to make . Excuse me. '  | He got up and started toward the door , and she stood up too , and ran after him . She caught his arms , and he swung round to face her . She half-moaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Embrace me for just one second . Kiss me , just once ! ' There were tears crowding out of her closed eyes . For Christ 's sake ! ' he said , pulled his arms loose , and went out . Dave ? That girl ? ' she cried , and her terrible yearning turned into pain . He disappeared , and as she stood there , with her hand out , the pain spread in her chest and bowels ' again , slow at first and not hard , but then growing , and growing , and then she was calling loudly to Dave , something she had never said , she knew , Dave , for God 's sake , help me , you hurt me , ' and then the pain was so terrific that it seemed to lift her from the ground , and she saw how the fog was pouring in through the windows , filling the room , and the room vanishing , and Dave vanishing , and herself alone again , somewhere in space , in one of those beams again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , driving furiously , furiously , out and out and out toward the blackness and the tiny stars , and with the knowledgesuddenly that she was going to learn something , hear a voice from the motor drone , hear something which would explain everything , so that she would know at last , in the empty blackness , from the furious speed , what her whole life was a struggle to learn , if she did not smash up first , if terror did not drown her , learn what this fog , these lights , this roar of machinery , this grinding pain , these cries to him for help , were for .. . Mask , quick ! ' Here . ' How is the heart ? ' Slower , Doctor . '  |p137Adrenalin  . ' This is ticklish , ' the young doctor muttered through his mask . There , she 's going under again . ' ... and now out and out into the blackness , where pain ceased , and danger ceased , and sound and light and real motion , and you were hurled smoothly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was all you yearned for in the blackness and the unfelt cold .. . But then , once more , everything was real enough again , and she had learned nothing except that now it was necessary to drive as fast as she could , tear up the highway , away from him , racing back to what ? Home ? The garage ? She did not know . But she knew that she had to press the gas down as hard as it would go and take these corners sharp , let up a little as she came to them , and then , as she went into the curve , press down hard so that the tires stuck on the right side and she swept out free and fast into the straightaway . Somewhere the sun was shining , sinking , sending a curious pinkness through the fog , and the air was faintly green , because  it was day still , but the trees which shed the greenness on either side of the highway were limp and strange , like trees under water , dripping and waving like vegetation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waving their arms . Careful ! She jammed her foot on the brake so that her tires screamed , swept up on the wrong side of the curve , but met nothing , and coasted over again on the right side , and then once more let the motor out . Her hat was on the seat beside her , and her hair streamed in the wind like a flag and the wet air struck her face sharply like hands . Ahead , the fog was red with the lights of the city going on , and now , through the thinning trees along the highway , the lights of houses shone . She pressed down hard on the gas and heard the soft roar of her engine in the deepening dusk , and the machine fled , or charged , along the dim highway , swept round curves , leaped up rises and roared into declines like an armored beast , enraged and incredibly powerful . She drove with a controlled fury , her hands exerting only a normal pressure on the wheel , but her foot pressed down hard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this speed were about to reveal something momentous to her , as if this speed were itselfan answer to something , this speed which then seemed more important than anything in her life , even life , even Dave . She was coming to the intersection with the highway which led directly into the city , and she took her foot off the accelerator . At the intersection she stopped for lights . She was breathing hard with excitement . Then she got her signal and turned sharply right , onto the city highway . Here the traffic was heavier , and she had to drive more slowly , but still she drove faster than she should have , unable to keep her speed down , darting in and out between cars , expertly , and not troubled by the fog now because the highway was illuminated , not troubled , as long as she kept up her speed , by thought . She came to a stretch without traffic , and she let out the motor again . The powerful purr of the engine pleased her , and , leaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she smiled . Only then she saw that she was taking a curve , sweeping out on the wrong side , and , too late , sweeping ahead at lights , a great shape , a truck , then a tremendous jolt , and then nothing at all .. . ... nothing but blackness , out into which she kept moving , free of her car now , and moving wonderfully in a regular circle , a circle which widened and widened , and as it did so letting all sensations , one by one , fall away . A familiar voice was saying Back her up , back her up , ' a flat , metallic voice , a voice without feeling or meaning , a voice at once strange and familiar in its curious , mechanical repetitiousness . This voice , in the blackness , was her only sensation . Lights andp139roaring and pain had gone , and in the blackness , as she swung ever out and out , nearer toward what seemed to be a few cold , distant , unblinking stars , only the voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changing to the older voice  --  and as the voice changed , she felt her whole being wracked with longing  --  the slightly wheezing voice , the clownish voice , and the words changed , and now , as she seemed to straighten her course and soar swiftly and cleanly out toward the distant stars , the new voice said , Bring her in , bring her in , bring her in . ' Everything she had ever felt seemed concentrated now into a single yearning desire to be with the voice and then presently , in the blackness , the form itself appeared , the old man , motioning with mechanical regularity , until , weeping with desire , she came to where he was . And then she began to laugh , as , in that outermost place , she felt his arms grip her and , in that embrace , they moved farther out together . She was laughing , and wanting to say something , for now everything was clear . She looked close into his face as they sped through blackness , at the old skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relishing grin , and she laughed again , as she had often laughed at him without knowingquite why , this ancient clown . But his arms were sinewy around her , and there was no longer any wondering in her mind , any yearning in her anywhere . She closed her eyes , and this embrace was everything  --  Dave , mother , father , life  --  and her laughter died to a smile . She opened her eyes and , in his thin arms at last , swam out with infinite pleasure , in the cold blackness , toward those cold and distant stars which now , slowly , were blinking out . Later , in the doctors ' dressing room , the two men were talking . Who was she ? ' the young man asked . She 's just been identified , ' said the other . Her name was Marge Walton . Rich girl . '  | Marge Walton ! No fooling ? I 've seen that car . What a baby ! ' ' So ? ' Big , open , high-powered foreign job . Black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a boat . Like a big , roaring beetle . What a waste ! ' You could probably pick it up cheap now . ' Yeah ! ' laughed the young man . After she tied it up in knots . ' The old man was buttoning his shirt and suddenly paused . He looked at the young man and shook his head . I do n't understand it . She was banged up pretty badly , it 's true , and she had lost some blood , but not enough to cut her off like that . From the moment she came in , everything began to slow up . The adrenalin did n't begin to take hold ! She was n't trying very hard , I 'm afraid . ' And the young man , who was about to leave , said , Some want to live , some do n't . That 's something we do n't know about , and something they do n't  --  until they go under . Well , I 'll see you . '  | THEY WERE SITTING on the steps in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elbows , their legs stretched out . The boy stared at the Georgian dormitories across the street and the neat Ionic columns of the library . The trees were bright red and yellow , and leaves kept falling listlessly to the fading grass . Smoke was curling up from a pile of leaves . It 's different in your last year , ' the boy said . It 's a lot different . ' The girl looked at him briefly . Is it ? ' Everything 's clearer , sort of , ' he said . Buildings , trees  --  people , too . Smoke makes you feel sad . ' The girl sat up suddenly and said , You know , Johnny , I 've been thinking  --  my father really ruined my mother 's life . That 's what it comes down to . ' He turned in quick surprise . Your father is a great man , Gay . ' She twirled a flower in her hand  --  a late daisy she had pulled up idly in a meadow where they had been walking  --  and said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , he 's a dear , but he is stuffy . ' He 's the greatest headmaster in this country ! ' Do n't be so solemn , ' she laughed , twirling the daisy in his face . Headmaster ! ' She leaned on her elbows again , threw her head back , and stared up at the sky . Think how full of excitement the world is , ' she cried , and  --  and life ! I want to be great , a really great artist . I want to be the great pianist that Marian did n't become , and play before huge audiences , and be applauded , be really great ! ' She turned to him abruptly and asked , Do you think I can be ? ' You sound like Katharine Hepburn , ' he said quietly , but his breath caught as he looked at her . She ignored him . Marian 's wonderful , ' she said , and Dearest , too .... I 'm going in ! ' He touched her forearm . Gay .. What ? ' Gay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' She laughed . Let 's go in , ' she said , and jumped up . He stood up and said again , Gay ... ' But she was openingthe door , and he followed her into the house . Her mother and grandmother were in the music-room , and he shook hands with each of them , and then Mr. Baring , the headmaster , himself appeared , like a shadow from somewhere in the room . He seemed slighter than he did out of doors or in chapel , and his voice seemed softer in that room . He greeted the boy and turned to speak to Gay , but she was settling down between the two women on a sofa . Each of them took one of her hands . We were just going to have some of the Tristan music , ' Marian Baring said . Do you like it ? ' He said that he did , and sat down on a hard chair , frail and old , with a yellow satin seat . When he turned to speak to Mr. Baring again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up from the narrow sofa , but Gay cried , No , Dearest , let me ! ' She went quickly to the phonograph , and presently the music began to pour into the room , softly at first , then louder and louder , until the delicately-papered walls might have burst with the swell . Gay tiptoed back to her seat between her mother and grandmother . Dearest 's eyes were closed tightly , everythingp143in the room shut out from her ; Marian 's eyelids drooped , as if she were dozing in a warm place ; only Gay 's were open , clear and exultant . Together the three of them swayed gently back and forth , their heads and shoulders just perceptibly moving . The old grandmother was garish . She wore a green silk dress that made her face , in spite of the bright spots of rouge on her cheeks and the lipstick on her mouth , look like wrinkledyellow parchment ; her white hair was not quite ordered , and not quite white ; long drops of jet shook from her ears , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gay 's mother had some of Dearest 's features , but she looked like an artist of the early twenties : black hair combed tight against her head , heavy brows and sleepy eyes , and an ivory-white skin ; dressed simply in a linen blouse , high at the neck and full in the sleeves , which hung over a rather long black skirt . Gay , taller than they , with her father 's hair , straight and the color of sand , wore a rough skirt and woolly sweater with a short string of pearls . Her bare arms and legs were tanned , and her face had the brown , scrubbed look that Johnny found so moving , with a gleam in her cheeks and chin , and lips the color of coral . Her eyes , blue like her father 's , had a curious light in them as she listened , which made her lovelier than ever , but which left Johnny , set away from the three of them on his straight chair , looking vaguely unhappy . When Gay rose to turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harsh sigh from the grandmother and the click of the machine were the only sounds . They settled down on the sofa again until the record was finished . Gay snapped off the machine . The old woman opened her black eyes and said in her deep , cracked voice , Oh , dear ! How I yearned to sing Isolde ! ' Gay , leaning against the victrola , said to Johnny , I told you that Dearest sang in opera when she was young , did n't I ? '  | And the old woman , with a shiver of acute remembrance in her voice , Oh , those days ! Those days ! ' It was in Richmond , Virginia , ' Marian said , that you first sang Isolde , Dearest . I remember the flowers in your dressing-room afterwards  --  you were a great success , and so beautiful ! And the people driving off in their carriages , horses prancing , and the city very gay ! I was a little girl in a white dress , with pink flowers in my hair , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was proud ! ' Gay , in her clear , high voice , cried , Was n't it thrilling ! ' And , to her grandmother , her voice more subdued , Your life was so lovely ! Oh , I shall be a pianist ! ' Of course , you will , child ! Of course , you will ! ' Dearest croaked . Tell him about Prince Rupert and the jewels , ' Gay said . The old woman wagged her head . That 's our secret , child , ' she said . We must all keep some secrets if we are to live at all . But the Prince was very gracious ... She was just one step from the Metropolitan . . . . ' Marian mused . Well , ' said the old woman , one step or two , but  --  oh yes , close ! Only those were hard years , and Art suffered . And our poor company was forced to disband . And the Metropolitanwas n't hiring young singers in those lean years . And your father , Marian , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hard man in some ways , with fixed masculine ideas about the proprieties , and glad , really , that my career ended . I do n't think he ever quite understood me , my needs ... But , Dearest , he loved you , ' Gay said , surely he loved you ! ' Loved me ? Of course he loved me  --  in his unbending way . But sometimes  --  ' She broke off , held her hands out before her and looked at the glittering array of rings on her fingers . I 'm sentimental about that music . Let 's do have just the Liebestod , if the young man does n't mind . '  |p145I  'd like it , ' he said quietly . Gay started the phonograph , and the three women again sat together on the crowded sofa , swaying to the rise and fall . When the Liebestod was finished , the old woman opened her eyes and looked at Johnny closely , then began to wag her index finger at him . Art and Love , Art and Love ! You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we women , we 're such ninnies , we do n't usually regret our choice . ' Marian smiled faintly as she rose and walked toward the piano . The grandmother watched her sit down and , pointing to a picture at one end of the room , cried abruptly , Do you see that portrait , young man ? ' It was of Marian as a young and beautiful woman , wearing a white taffeta evening gown with a brilliant blue sash , and the toes of blue slippers showing under the stiff hem of her skirt . She was sitting with her back to a black piano , one elbow on the keys , her head resting on her hand . That , ' croaked the grandmother , is my daughter when she , like me before her , was on the very point of becoming a great , indeed a renowned , artist . And then , like me  --  ' She laughed again , her harsh , theatrical laugh , and wagged her finger at Johnny once more . You men ! You men ! ' Johnny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she demanded . Of course ! Marian was a very handsome woman , were n't you , my dear ? And the artist , young man , was Sargent , a very great painter , as you no doubt know . ' She turned to her daughter quickly and cried , Do you remember those sittings ? You were just twenty .... ' Yes , ' Marian said , her eyes as slumbrous as if she were listening to the Tristan Prelude again . Yes , I remember . Sargent was an old man , and very witty , and he painted from a white palette . I remember he said that that explained the intensity of his colors . ' Gay , who had been looking from one to the other with shining eyes , cried , How could you bear to leave all that ? '  | Her voice was almost anguished , and Johnny turned his face away quickly . Both women looked at her with silent benediction , and Dearest said , Let the child play . ' Do , Gay , ' Johnny said . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , no . Look , here 's father . ' The headmaster was standing in the doorway , his thin shoulders stooped , his arms dangling at his sides . Johnny got to his feet . Sit down , sit down , ' he said . Do n't let me interrupt . Is the music finished ? ' Tristan , Tristan ! ' the grandmother sighed . I shall never have enough of it while I live . ' Nor I ! ' cried Marian . Nor I ! ' cried Gay . The headmaster , hesitating just inside the door , looked at the three of them and said , I thought Wagner had gone out of fashion . ' They looked up at him sharply . Fools ! ' snapped thegrandmother , and Gay cried , Oh , father , do n't be silly ! ' They stared at him , and he said , I 'm sorry .... ' Johnny faced the headmaster , his back squarely to thewomen . I must go , ' he announced . Do n't go , young man , ' said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marian . Stay a while ! ' Gay said casually . Johnny , looking intently at the headmaster , did not turn . Finally , Mr. Baring said , Do n't let me frighten you away . ' Oh , no , sir , it 's not that . . . ' he said . It 's been very nice to see you , ' said Marian . It cheers me to find a young man who 's fond of music , ' croaked Dearest . Come again , soon , Johnny , ' Gay said . Thank you , ' he answered , and went out.  |p147Mr  . Baring held the door open . Yes , do let us see more of you , ' he said in a voice that sounded like something coming from the bottom of a well . Johnny said , Thank you , sir , ' loudly , and hesitated . I like to have the boys come in . Not many of you do . ' Oh , sir , ' Johnny started , we I ' His voicebroke , and he could hardly mumble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ? ' Mr. Baring asked , smiling faintly . Johnny drew a deep breath . Nothing , sir  --  I guess . ' He plunged down the steps . It was late afternoon , the sky was bright blue and streaked with saffron , the leaves were incredibly gay , the smell of smoke was sharp on the air , and the distant sounds of boys ' voices came from the playing fields . Suddenly , he did not know what to do next . He shoved his hands into his pockets and shuffled along the sidewalk , kicking through drifts of dead and rattling leaves . Damn , ' he muttered , damn , damn , damn ! ' And finally , stopping dead in his tracks and looking up , God damn them ! '  | IT WAS TWO O'CLOCK in the morning and the still brilliantly illuminated living room of Lotta Gordon 's country house had a cold air of emptiness , which the three people in it did nothing to relieve . All the other guests had gone upstairs to bed , and the ladies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Mr. Payson , who , unaware of the affront , was resting stuporously with his chin fallen forward on the bulge of his shirt front , his eyes closed . Mrs. Payson leaned forward . I must warn you , Lotta , ' she said . In a moment he 'll begin to snore . We 'll try not to hear . ' Our conversation is not stimulating , I should say . ' Pay no attention to him , ' Mrs. Payson said as she turned to look at her husband with glassy-eyed distaste . Lotta sipped at her highball before she said , He drinks rather too much , does n't he ? ' Mrs. Payson nodded . Constantly in the country . And so it is a delight to find someone who will sit up after everyone else has gone to bed and be lucid with one . ' Lucid ? ' Lotta repeated doubtfully . You are lucid , Lotta , you know . ' Am I ? ' Oh , definitely ! '  |p149Lotta  looked down into her glass and said , It was amusinglyevident , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a struggle was going on . His back so erect , eyes fixed on one small , stationary object or another , almost desperately . ' Mrs. Payson laughed . My dear , I know ! He always loses . ' She smiled and put her head back , arched her spine , and lifted her arms in a long stretch . Drinking , Lotta , is a refinement that should be reserved for the appreciative . Now I  --  I get the most delicious sensations . Sometimes almost of a submarine world . All movement becomes luxurious . Sometimes I seem to myself almost like a strange plant on the ocean floor . ' A sound broke from Mr. Payson , at first almost like a purr , but in a few moments stronger and louder until presently it had developed into an obvious and disturbing snore . Mrs. Payson did not turn to look at him , but Lotta 's eyes moved ever so slightly until her cold glance fixed itself upon him . Do be still , ' Mrs. Payson said sharply , without turning , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And now , ' she said , now I must get him to bed ! ' We 'll wake him Wake him ? My dear , you do n't know ! You ca n't wake him . He 's as good as dead now . Wake him , indeed ! That is n't sleep , Lotta . That is a drunken stupor . ' Yes , ' said Lotta , so it is . What shall we do with him ? ' Mrs. Payson put her head back and emptied her glass . Then she came to her feet , swaying slightly , and said , There 's only one technique . ' Let me call one of the servants , ' Lotta said , rising too , and standing beside Mrs. Payson . In their long gowns they looked very tall , fragile , and very slim . We must not take advantage of him , ' Mrs. Payson pointed out , and , glancing at him again , added , Unattractive jelly that he is ! ' A speculative silence followed upon her wordsp150as they regarded him together . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one technique . If urged , his feet will more or less work , so we shall not have to carry him , at any rate . We 'll push him up the stairs . From the rear . ' Oh . ' To begin , ' she went on crisply , we must each take hold of an arm and pull . ' They leaned over the figure in the chair and wrapped their long , sinuous arms round Mr. Payson 's heavy ones , and , when Mrs. Payson signaled All right , ' pulled . With a grunt which interrupted the snoring  --  indeed , ended it  --  Mr. Payson 's ample body came to its feet . Walk ! ' Mrs. Payson ordered . A kind of shudder passed through the sagging form , and then , feebly co-operative , the dragging feet moved along between the ladies ' into the foyer and to the foot of the stairs . Now we rest , ' said Mrs. Payson breathlessly . Mr. Payson was let slowly down on his face , his head on the fourth step , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoes so that he would not slip down . Lotta , disheveled but hardly panting , leaned against the wall . Her hand , it seemed to Mrs. Payson , rose dreamily to her face as she said , Such a burden to you , dear . ' I ca n't tell you , really . ' Poor dumb thing , ' Lotta said wearily . No pity ! ' Mrs. Payson warned her almost sharply . I have n't a shred of it , you know , not a shred ! It 's a sad admission , but '  --  and her arm went out in a languid arc until her hand pointed at him with limp accusation  --  I ask you , in all fairness , has he deserved it ? ' Poor dumb thing ! ' We 'll have another highball , ' Mrs. Payson said , once We 've got him tucked away . ' And more briskly , more brightly than she had yet spoken , Well , then , to work ! ' With the efficiency of experience she bent swiftly to herp151task . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encircling his torso with her arms , and , panting , pulled him up . Onto the banister , thus ! ' With his chest flat against the broad marble banister , one arm flung over it , Mr. Payson seemed to rest comfortably . Now I 'll need you , Lotta . He 's really quite heavy , is n't he ? We push now . ' She moved her arms until her hands were firmly planted against Mr. Payson 's bottom , and Lotta arranged her hands similarly . Now ! ' cried Mrs. Payson . Slowly Mr. Payson began to move up the stairs . Inch by inch his chest slid along the banister and his limp feet , reluctantly , with the ladies ' feet just behind them so that they could not slip back , dragged themselves up , step by step . Save your strength for what 's ahead , ' Mrs. Payson admonished . A slow , steady pressure does wonders at this stage . ' Lotta , laughing a little , said , No one can know how much this has done for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , can know the discipline to my spirit ! ' The unsteady progress continued until , with a note of imminenttriumph in her voice , Mrs. Payson called out , Gently , now ! Gently ! Just one more step ! ' And , There ! ' With a quick movement she braced herself against the body . Up ! ' she commanded harshly as the feet threatened to slip . Up , now ! ' The feet obeyed and Mr. Payson , doubledover the top of the broad banister , became stationary . Lotta moved to a mirror and pushed her hair back from her face with languorous hands . Lotta , with your head raised that way , your neck  --  really , it 's lovely . ' Lotta smiled and said , Let 's finish . Your room , fortunately , is just there . '  | From here to that table , then on to the door , ' Mrs. Payson said . Will you open it ? ' Once more , with their arms wrapped round his , the ladies pulled Mr. Payson along between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him down again . But the movement was too abrupt or Mr. Payson too heavy for the table , for instantly , without a warning creak , the table crashed under him and he fell headlongamong the ruins of it , his head , after one thud , resting gently against the opened door of his own room , his body half across the , It 's quite all right . ' How too exasperating ! ' Look , ' said Lotta then , do n't you really think that one 's always spending much too much time on drunkards , always trying to get them from where they are to where one thinks they should be ? Why not leave him there ? He 's perfectly comfortable , you know . ' Mrs. Payson 's face broke into smiles of pleasure . Lotta , ' she said , you are lucid , you see ! Just one moment . ' Stepping cautiously around Mr. Payson 's head , she disappeared into their room for a moment and returned with a comforter . Or I 'll be having to nurse him with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the still form . The gentle introductionto his snoring had begun again , and Mrs. Payson listened to it for a moment before she straightened up and said , Now for our reward , our highball ! ' Lotta started down the stairs , moving slowly , with infinite grace , her gown molded about her long legs and trailing behind her in exquisite folds . It seemed to Mrs. Payson that she moved like a figure in a slow dance or like vegetation in a submarine world . Then Mr. Payson 's purring broke again into the harsher snore , and suddenly Mrs. Payson swung around with repressedfury and stamped her long , narrow foot at him . Oh , you ! ' she cried.  |p153He  did n't touch his coleslaw , ' said Mrs. Payson to Lotta Gordon , and both of them looked up from the ground before them , from the cloth on which the bowl of coleslaw stood fresh and incongruous , to glance at the figure of Mr. Payson recumbent against the trunk of an oak tree . Oh , well , ' said Lotta cheerfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't want coleslaw for our picnic . He insisted . Lotta , I wanted an idyll . ' And with a little gesture of despair , she indicated the half-dozen sheep grazing in the meadow beyond . It 's the first opportunity those beasts of his have ever had to be of any earthly use . ' It 's lovely , ' Lotta said comfortingly , and the creatures are very apt . ' Not lovely enough , ' said Mrs. Payson . This was to be my celebration of the season , Lotta ! ' And to think that he could have been the season 's god today ! ' Lotta said . Precisely , ' said Mrs. Payson , a little startled by the idea . They were seated on the ground at the edge of the grove behind the Paysons ' house , just where it joined the meadow in which Mr. Payson confined his sheep . The sun shone brightly in the meadow , but in the grove , where the new foliage on the trees glittered faintly , the shade was deep and green . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which held the remnants of their luncheon  --  the ravished guinea fowl , the aspic collapsed among its garnishes , and two wine bottles , one of them empty ; Mr. Payson , no longer of the party , reclined a few feet away . He , ' said Mrs. Payson as she looked away from him with a slight shudder , he decided , of course , long before you ar/rived , that he needed neither wine nor the wretched coleslaw for which he had clamored . He 's been on whiskey now for hours . ' There 's something of the zealot in him , is n't there ? ' said Lotta with a thin smile , as she looked at the empty tumbler beside Mr. Payson in the grass . Mrs. Payson looked at the sheep . Beyond the wooden fence , they seemed like little clouds which had settled on the grass they munched . I need a turn , ' Mrs. Payson said , and then both ladies untwined their limbs , rose slowly , and began to weave toward the sheep . ' My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ float ! ' Heady wine , ' Lotta commented , floating beside her . In the bright sunlight of the open expanse which skirted the grove , the ladies , drifting toward the fence , appeared remarkablytall and thin , but their fragile presence somehow alarmed the sheep , which looked up unanimously in sharp inquiry and moved together into a suspicious group . Why do they huddle so ? ' asked Mrs. Payson , leaning against a fence post . They 're not accustomed to the attention of shepherdesses , ' said Lotta . Mrs. Payson glanced back at her husband where he slept against his tree . Shepherdesses , dear ? ' she said . Then what is he ? ' Lotta , who had been poking with her pointed toe at some green vines which trailed along the ground below the fence , drew her foot back suddenly and , smiling , said , Your weary swain , of course . ' Mrs. Payson sighed Ah , me ! ' and then , with a sharp laugh , she cried Swain ! ' The sheep , startled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the center of the meadow . Silly things , ' said Mrs. Payson , a little flushed . Let 's have a drink . ' The rites of spring , by , all means , ' said Lotta , and theyp155swayed eagerly back to the cloth spread on the ground . While Mrs. Payson busied herself at a basket which stood open and conveniently near Mr. Payson 's tree , he made a sudden indelicatesound , a grunt or a snore , and the ladies looked at him dubiously over their shoulders . Lotta , taking her glass from Mrs. Payson , said , The swain is omitting nothing today , is he ? ' And at that moment , as if in reply , a second , sodden rumble from Mr. Payson 's throat thrust itself upon the pleasant air . But he 's so easy to live with , ' Mrs. Payson said . You 've no idea how relaxing he is . ' Lotta smiled and stretched her thin length tentatively along the ground as the solid rhythm of Mr. Payson 's snoring broke steadily upon the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lotta , drank almost rapidly , but Lotta , resting her head on her slim hand , sipped at her highball with her usual impassivity . When she had almost emptied her glass , Mrs. Payson rose from the ground and stared at her husband . This air , ' she said , whets my appetite astonishingly . ' She turned to the meadow , where the sheep were nibbling their way near again . You know , we do n't get out enough , Lotta . The earth , and all  --  we 're hothouse things , I suppose , really , are n't we ? ' Lotta said , Nonsense , my dear , we 're the season 's pretties . ' Her eyes glittered with laughter . Spring , ' exclaimed Mrs. Payson with soft-voiced reflection . Lotta sat up and looked at her . My dear , ' she said , did n't you speak of a rite to be performed ? ' It was Lotta herself who had suggested a ceremony , but Mrs. Payson did not notice the imposition . So I did ! ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ god . ' She glanced at Mr. Payson . But what was it that they did , Lotta  --  the Greeks ? ' They crowned him , my dear , they crowned him , ' Lotta said.  |p156Mrs  . Payson put down her empty glass . Dear swain , ' she said , and patted the top of Mr. Payson 's head . His sounds ceased and he moved a little under the impact . He lifted his knees , and then let them fall again , his legs stretched out once more straight before him . His toes pointed directly toward the sky . Mrs. Payson turned away from him and moved unsteadily about under the trees , searching the ground . Not a thing to weave with , ' she said disconsolately , walkingtoward the fence . Not a thing here that one could use to make a proper crown . ' The sheep fled again as Mrs. Payson came near them , and Lotta , turning her head to watch , saw that her friend was supporting herself against a fence post with one hand , and plucking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came wavering back to the grove , her arms filled with vines . Lotta sat up . What is that ? ' she asked . It 's myrtle , I 'm sure , ' Mrs. Payson said , or laurel , or something of the sort . I 've no idea , really , but wo n't it do beautifully ? ' Lotta 's quick glance darted to Mr. Payson 's head , and she allowed herself a small shudder of delight . Oh , beautifully , darling . It 's just right . ' Mrs. Payson made her way to her husband , and sinking to her knees before his upturned feet , she laid her green offering on his extended and unfeeling limbs . Then she began to separate the strands of vine and weave them into a crown . Do I look like his handmaiden ? ' she called merrily to Lotta . Lotta found it difficult to speak . Indeed ! ' she cried . If only he could witness your loving care . ' Wasted ! ' Mrs. Payson said , and she fixed together the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' she exclaimed with satisfaction for her handiwork , and pressed the green wreath upon his moist brow . Very slowly then , Mr. Payson 's eyelids lifted and for ap157moment his glazed eyes tried to comprehend the presence before him , but then , very slowly , the eyelids closed again and slowly the crowned head bowed . Lotta , too weak to rise , too weak to lift her elegant body from the grass , turned her head and saw that the sheep were moving timorously toward the fence again . She let her eyes rest on the place where Mrs. Payson had , by such remarkable chance , found the poison ivy , and then , thinking of the Paysons ' next day , she broke into exhausted little spasms of laughter . The happy home ! ' said Lotta Gordon as she stepped into the Paysons ' white drawing room that Sunday afternoon . She stood still for a moment , looking first at Mrs. Payson , in her lavender tea gown with its yards of chiffon draped round her , then at the defective whippet that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's thin hand was dangling toward the dog 's head . Mr. Payson sat oblivious in a chair near the small fire which burned decorously in the grate . On the table beside him were a half-emptied glass and the equipment for highballs . Lotta , how nice ! ' Mrs. Payson exclaimed . I 'm on my way into town , ' Lotta said . How pleasant of you to stop on your way . Sit here . ' Mrs. Payson patted the place beside her on the blue satin sofa . Lotta looked at Mr. Payson for a moment longer with that cold unconcern which almost never left her face , and then , languidly adjusting the half-dozen narrow furs which were wrapped about her neck and shoulders , came and sat down beside Mrs. Payson . The whippet raised its fragile head and sniffed the air.  | Little martens , are n't they ? ' Mrs. Payson said . They 're perfect for you ! Never wear large furs , Lotta . It 's those delicious little lank things that truly become you . ' Thank you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Mr. Payson ? ' She looked toward him inquiringly . His head was resting on his chest and his legs were stretched out before him . Do not mention the situation , ' Mrs. Payson admonished . I 've become quite accustomed to these charming Sunday afternoons at home in the country . Only occasionally do I still wish that he could get through until supper . Let 's sit over there . ' They rose , and the whippet clattered to its feet on the bare floor and tapped after them with its limping gait . They sat down again on a sofa which faced the windows , their backs firmly turned on Mr. Payson , who was , as it were , alone then in the room by the little fire . Now let us forget about him , ' Mrs. Payson said . But he 's making some sort of noise , ' Lotta said . As if he were trying to say something . ' Mr. Payson was making a series of small , grunting sounds , but he had not raised his head . Pure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Payson , and then , after a pause , Do you know , I 've met an old love of his . ' Vague animation stirred in Lotta 's eyes . Tell me , ' she said . ' Who ? ' Mrs. Payson produced the name with an air of restrained triumph . Vanessa Park . ' Lotta looked searchingly upward for a moment and then asked , The writer ? ' Is n't it marvelous ? ' Tell me , ' Lotta said again , and this time rather hurried to find a cigarette in her bag , lit it , and sank back quickly to listen . Mr. Payson 's muttering , somewhat more insistent now ,  |p159broke  the momentary silence , and the women glanced over their shoulders at him and quickly away again . Then suddenlythe whippet clambered to its feet and trotted into the middle of the room . It stood quite far from Mr. Payson and looked at him , its haunches quivering . Come back , Molly , ' Mrs. Payson ordered , and the dog came back to her . Poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand run idly along the dog 's lank side . The dog put its long head in Mrs. Payson 's lap for a moment , its thin legs trembling . About the old love , ' Lotta prompted . To be sure ! He announced abruptly one night not long ago that he had been lunching with her . " Vanessa Park ? " I said . " You know her ? " " Oh , yes , " said he . " But when ? When ? " I said . " How fascinating ! " I learned then that they had known each other somewhere once and have never quite lost touch  --  you know the sort of rather messy thing . He has all her books on his shelves . I did n't discover it until after he told me about her . Whenever she comes to town , which is about twice a year , they arrange to meet  --  to talk , I suppose , about the good old days ! ' Intrigue , ' Lotta said . I had n't suspected . ' Nor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intrigue , ' Mrs. Payson added , or I should n't have insisted that she come for dinner , which , you see , I did , being , I admit , really vulgarly curious . But you can see  --  I mean , one would be . ' Lotta put her head back and laughed silently . Of course ! ' she cried . How did it go ? ' I dressed in a rather frilly thing , but she , Lotta , she came directly from a library , where she had been all day , came loaded down with notebooks and papers and a map ! A great roll under her arm , heaven knows why . The idea did not strike me as particularly creative . And looking quite grubby , in a plain little suit , and her hair rather a mess . ' Lotta shifted her furs and let the toe of her narrow shoep160just touch the ear of the whippet , which quivered even as it lay at their feet . Not only was I made to feel giddy , Lotta , ' Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite overcome by the spectacle of my good man  --  the interest , the animation , such restraint with the liquor , and , most startling , the wealth of utterly unsuspected information on matters literary . ' Really ? ' It was definitely not my show . ' Shurlug glaw , ' said Mr. Payson rather loudly behind them . Please , ' said Mrs. Payson , only half turning her head . And once more the whippet rose and went to look at Mr. Payson . Come away , Molly , ' said Mrs. Payson . The whippet gazed at her over its narrow shoulder and came back . Then it stood looking out of the windows , at the meadows and the still-barren trees . The thin sunlight made its white coat gleam and cast faint shadows along its sides , where the fragile bones showed through its short hair . Its long neck was lifted and the little head alertly raised , and all the time its haunches quivered . Then suddenly its long , thin legs folded up under it and it rested once more at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bag for another cigarette . Tell me more about her , ' she said . I quite liked her , ' said Mrs. Payson reflectively . ' Althoughit was obvious , of course , that she loathed me and that she is a little lightheaded about my provider still . But I quite liked her . She has an air , of sorts . I felt real admiration for her , or at least as much as she would allow me to feel . ' She was friendly ? ' Yes , but rather in the way that God would be . So that I kept saying such silly things . Sickening things , really . How wonderful it must be to write books , for instance . " How fortunate you college women are ! " I said . '  |p161Lotta  smiled , and Mr. Payson repeated , Shurlug glaw . ' You 're quite certain ? ' Lotta asked , glancing over her shoulder . Stiff , ' said Mrs. Payson . No sensation whatever , you know . ' Molly raised her head from where it rested in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Mr. Payson . She said that she had read so much in preparation for a new book that her brain was utterly addled . Lotta , I heard myself giggle like a girl and say , " Oh , Miss Park , you should do as I do . I never read . " And she looked at me and said , " Do n't you really ? " Now , of course I read . I read quite a lot . What prompted me to say that ? ' Lotta 's voice was faint with mirth . Oh , my dear ! ' she said . At one point  --  but this was after several highballs  --  when he was talking about her first book , I said , " Flow depressing , Miss Park , to think that while you were doing that I was spending a whole year on coming out ! " and instantly could have fled . I had no intention of saying that , Lotta . Why did I ? ' Lotta stirred . She looked at me like a sad Minerva , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked , " What did you do before your marriage ? ; I mean , what sort of work ? " ' Lotta closed her eyes and laughed without making a sound . My dear , ' she said , the woman sounds impossibly thick . I should have said the same things . ' Oh , no , not you , Lotta , ' Mrs. Payson said . You are really composed . You are a profoundly composed woman . ' Wearily , as if the narrative had rather exhausted her , she rose then and said , Let us have a drink . ' She walked across the room toward Mr. Payson , with her chiffon veils fluttering gently round her , and the whippet made its staccato sounds on the bare floor . Lotta rose too , moved her little furs about her neck , and followed . The dog stopped at a good distance from Mr. Payson 's chair and regarded him with its remote glance . Mrs. Payson , mixing highballs , was bending over the table beside Mr. Payson 's chair . Mr. Payson continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his feet out before him . Lotta looked down at him from what would have seemed great height if he had opened his eyes . Shlooks liker gaw , ' Mr. Payson said . He is troubled by a dream , ' Lotta said . I am sure of it . ' Nonsense , my dear , ' said Mrs. Payson as she handed her a glass . They stood above him , looking down . There is no sensation whatever . ' The whippet clattered cautiously up behind them and leaned against Mrs. Payson . She let her fingers creep about its throat and feel the taut cords that stretched under its skin . Then she caressed the delicate skull and gently pulled at the pointed ears . After she left , Lotta , ' she said at last , still looking down at Mr. Payson , he asked me how I liked her , and I said , " Oh , very much . " " Do you ? " he said . " Yes , " I said , " I do . If only she would let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing the world 's work  --  it brings out the very worst in me . Everything I said tonight was absurd , and I 'm quite annoyed with myself . " And then , my dear , he looked at me in a way that rather turned me cold , and he said , " I wish you were , I wish that I could think you really were . " ' Lotta gave her silent laugh again and the whippet raised its small head from among the lavender folds of Mrs. Payson'sgown and looked at Lotta inquiringly . Then Mr. Payson'sfeet moved and his relaxed hands twitched on the arms of his chair . Shlooks liker gaw , ' he said . He 's making an effort , ' Lotta said.  |p163Mr  . Payson was making an effort . His hands gripped the arms of the chair , his feet drew in , his head straightened . He could not , apparently , open his eyes , but with almost desperateclarity he said at last what had been troubling him all the while . He said , She looks like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She laughed with little hoots of mirth , and a tiny shriek , and her shoulders shook so violentlyfor a moment that the furs about her neck suddenly looked like little live things.  | AT LAST Willard Penny even read Gregory Marvin 's book of poems . He gave the better part of an eveningover to it , and when he snapped the thin volume shut after he had read the last lyric , he did it with a kind of triumphant dispatch , and went to bed feeling very fine indeed . For now , more than ever , he was convinced that Marvin was the merest egotist , such an unbalanced poseur that he did not deserve a rational man 's attention , much less his impatience . He lay in bed and planned his lecture for the next morning , outlined in his mind a preliminary talk on Milton'searly poems , and was annoyed that a line from Marvin 's book should now and again come bouncing into his brain . He had been formulating his opening paragraph : Ladies and gentlemen  --  the early poems of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true idea of the poet 's temperament . So different are these verses from the poems he was to produce in his later years that it is difficult to believe they came from the same pen . Take , as an example , the famous lines from L'Allegro . ' . . . And then , for no reason , he was quoting to himself that frightful line from Marvin : ... heroes ' feetWashed by dreaming women 's hands . . . Take , as an example , the famous lines from L'Allegro ' . . heroes ' feet ! Damn the man ! he thought , and skipped ahead in his lec/ture : To know Milton , really , we must look carefully into those days he spent at Cambridge , those days in which he was unkindly nicknamed the lady of Christ 's . ' Do his writingsof this period indicate that he was indeed what that name implies ? Take , as an example , this early sonnet . . . heroes ' feet , heroes ' feet , heroes ' feet ... or has the bulk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man ... heroes ' feet , washed by dreaming women 's hands ... . Great God ! Only Marvin could have written such a line , and only Marvin would have had the tastelessness to publish it . And addressed , no doubt , to his wife , poor creature ! The insufferable arrogance ! He rolled back and forth on his bed and tried with desperate concentration to keep Milton in mind . You will find in the Epistles to Diodati a characteristic spirit of youthfulness and amiability ; likewise , in certain of the early sonnets you cannotescape . . . heroes ' feet . . . dreaming women 's hands ... heroes ' feet . Later he drowsed off , between twisted sheets , on a hot pillow . Willard Penny looked like a dried-up little man of sixty or more , but he was only forty-six . During the last twenty years , besides lecturing on English literature , he had made three trips abroad and had published a small collection of essays on the religious poets of the seventeenth century . With bald head , scraggly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his nose , and chin retreating into a wrinkled collar , the picture was not auspicious . In the company of strangers he was overcome with timidity , and even among his closest colleagues he was shy , and so he lived almost entirelyto himself . Except for two gestures toward matrimony , his existence had been singularly free of romantic adventure . In his youth he had made inarticulate love to a classmate who had finally chosen to devote her life to social service . Much later , not without fear and trembling , he had proposed to the widow of a colleague who , after some hesitation , assured him that she would always think of him with fondness and then , rather too promptly , married the baseball coach . Ever since , Mr. Penny had restricted his devotions to teaching and to literature . By the time he reached forty , he no longer had the inclination to look beyond them . Only Gregory Marvin had seriously and consistently broken in on his content . It was unfortunate that they were members of the same department in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poet to the attention of Mr. Penny almost every day . Gregory Marvin , although he , too , was in his forties and a teacher of English literature , was wholly different from Mr. Penny . He was tall and lean , and had a rugged , browned face . His hair was thick and iron-gray , and it flowed back from his high forehead like the mane of an animal . He dressed meticulously and affectedly , with his shirt open at the neck and his collar brought outside his coat , or with a flowing scarf tied in a bow as a cravat , and he wore no hat . He , too , had produced a critical work , entitled The Romantic Fulfillment . He conducted himself with a disregard for academic convention which marked him as a poet , even a prophet ; and , being a loquacious individual , he did not hesitate to speak what was on his mind to anyone who cared to listen . He was an experimenter in verse and a liberal in politics . His life had never been orthodox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditions of his respectable family and gone to sea . Later he had subjected himself to an education and then , before the prospect of teaching , had become successivelya cab driver , the conductor of a Rocky Mountain tour , the founder of a magazine in Prague , and the proprietor of an advanced bookshop on Eighth Street in New York . When the bookshop failed he was in his early thirties and ,  |p167|perha|ps  because some of his energy had subsided , he settled down to two years of graduate work . Finally , in spite of earlier vows , he accepted an appointment as lecturer in romantic poetry . Since then he had been married three times and publicly in love at least thirty . There was nothing about him that Willard Penny did not seem to despise . Marvin was a man of supreme self-confidence , who clearly felt that his life and his personality and his poems marked him off from the crowd as a man of unusual endowment . Penny thought his life merely undisciplined , his personality obnoxious , and his poems maudlin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Penny had sat ill at ease and wordless through innumerable faculty meetings , and for ten years Gregory Marvin had not let a meeting pass at which he had not found something to say . What is more , his audience listened . Perhaps that more than anything else irritated Mr. Penny  --  that anyone should listen ! He sometimes thought with satisfaction that the girls rather than the men in Marvin 's classes found him marvelous . Likewise , the wives of his colleagues rather than his colleagues themselves listened to him with rapt attention . Surely , Mr. Penny thought , something innate in every man must be revoltedby the qualities of his mind and by the flavor of his personality . And yet , there was the evidence of the faculty meetings : men did listen to Gregory Marvin . So for ten years Willard Penny 's life was tinctured by this hate for a man he knew only from a distance . Often he laughed at himself , told himself that it was ridiculous to allow the man , who was , after all , of infinite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he next encountered him in the corridor towering above a cluster of admiring females , waving his hands in the air while he expostulated on the characteristics of Byronism or the political principles of Shelley , Mr. Penny would scurry into his office , slam the door behind him , and sit down at his desk in a trembling frenzy of rage that he could not overcome for hours.  | By the end of the day he would have forgotten again , or would have laughed himself into a better mood and then , likely as not , he would meet the Marvins on his way to dinner . ( They always seemed to be walking the streets ! ) And seeing them together enraged him more , if that was possible , than seeing Marvin alone . The fashion in which they walked represented for Mr. Penny not only the relationship between Marvin and his wife but the whole relationship which Marvin thought that he had established with the rest of the world . Perhaps it was because the poet walked so fast that his wife could not keep up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression of her humility that she walked quietly , a few paces behind him . Whatever the reason , the sight threw Mr. Penny into such a fury that , meeting them thus , he would clench his fists so tightly in his pockets that his nails left marks in the palms of his hands . The arrogant oaf striding ahead , with head thrown up and hair and tie flowing back , and that docile creature , his wife , hurrying along lest she fall too far behind , her head lowered so that she hardly saw the people who passed . This was the epitome of Marvin 's character , and what Mr. Penny felt on such occasions , the very essence of his outrage . And then , on one fine winter afternoon , Mr. Penny closed his books , secured himself against the weather in rubbers , muffler , overcoat , hat and earmuffs , and started out on a long walk . He went out of the town by way of the campus and was presently surrounded by winter fields , and he was happy . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Morning of Christ 's Nativity ' sang themselves through his mind : It was the winter wildWhile the Heaven-born childAll meanly wrapt in the rude manger lies . . . He thought that some day he would publish an anthology ofp169Christmas verse , and this poem would have first place . He walked along swiftly , and took pleasure in the crunch of his feet on the crusted snow , in the wind that blew into his face , in the bent branches of trees fabulously spangled with ice . He almost sang the words of the poem : No war or battle 's sound Was heard the world around . The idle spear and shield .. . And as he turned at last to make his way back to the town , a mood for work was suddenly upon him , and he hurried , lost now in thoughts of the paper on Milton 's debt to the Metaphysicalswhich he would begin that very afternoon . He was crossing the campus again , planning his essay , storing away in his mind phrases that he could use and illustrationsfrom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the skating rink , a flying figure on the ice caught his eye , and he looked up out of his reverie to see Marvin and his wife alone on the rink , the poet cutting and recutting a figure eight , and his wife , standing still on her skates , watching him . A purple muffler sailed behind him as he skated , and his feet cut across the ice with marvelous precision and grace . Willard Penny suppressed a groan and then , almost unwillingly , stopped to watch . In an instant he had forgotten all about his paper . The skater slowly came to a stop before his wife and , seeing Penny , waved to him . Hello , Penny ! ' he called . Fine afternoon , what ? ' Mr. Penny smiled unhappily . Yes . . . fine , ' he called back . Mrs. Marvin looked up and smiled at him for an instant before she looked back to her husband . She said something to him , and he looked away from Penny and down at her , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down at her shoes , and for what seemed to be some time they stood in that attitude , the poet tall , colorful , his bare , gray head sharp against the blowing , purple scarf , and the woman small before him , a rather drab figure with her mittened hands folded across her breast and her head bent so that Penny saw the white curve of her neck above the fur collar of her skating jacket . What Penny was thinking at that moment , he did not know , and in another instant he was thinking nothing at all , for it was then that an outrageous thing occurred . Suddenly the world had changed , and where there had been snow and ice and bare trees , there was now a green meadow studded with brilliant flowers , great leafy trees around it , and above , in place of the leaden winter sky , a fabric of blue such as he had never seen on a summer 's day . And in the middle of the meadow , where the skaters had been standing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a tall , magnificently formed man with a straight , brown body and a noble face , and the other , worshiping , a woman , soft and lovely and gleaming white , her breasts lifted in her hands like an offering , and her head bent in complete surrender . The slope of her shoulders and the arch of her neck were eloquent with adoration before the overwhelming pride and strength and beauty in the body of the man . In an instant the vision was gone , and the world was of snow and ice again , and the two people on the rink were properlyclothed once more and were suddenly circling and recirclingon the ice with incredible speed and grace . A late afternoonwind blew into Mr. Penny 's face , and he shivered . But the sensation he had experienced in his vision , that what he saw was essentially and terribly right  --  that lingered for a moment , and with it a glow of admiration . Then these faded , and he discovered that his rancor had gone too , and as he started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unprecedented thing that had happened to him , he knew that Gregory Marvin could never seem the same again . But what was much more disturbing , he , Willard Penny , could never possibly seem again the same to himself . And afterward , it was always that fact which outraged him.  | Do YOU KNOW , ' Mrs. Herman said , that we are probablylooking directly at Lisbon ? ' Her daughter and her son-in-law were sitting on the beach . beside her , but even when she spoke to them she did not take her melancholyeyes from the point where the pale-blue Atlantic joined the pale-blue sky . Lisbon , ' she said , a little door toward which half the population of a continent crowds , or yearns to . ' She spoke with a husky , forensic flourish , like an old-school actress . Eve Abrams , sensing her mother 's mood , gave a snort of impatience and called to her children . The children paid no attention . At the edge of the water , Dickie was pursuing little Evvie with a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was crying . Jellyfish ! ' Harold Abrams stood up and said , I 'll get them , Eve , ' and trotted off . It was late in September and the beach was as empty as the sea . There was an offshore breeze , but under the dune where Mrs. Herman now sat alone with her daughter the air was still and the sunlight mellow . The tide was in , and the sea between the two great rocky arms reaching out from either end of the long beach , was almost quiet . At the shore the water was motionless ; only at the base of a great , black rock which jutted from the water a hundred yards out did it move tirelessly , in small , foamless , slapping waves . Iron-gray at the shore , it soon softened to amethyst , then to turquoise , and then , limitlessly , to the soft , burning blue which was almost identical with the color of the sky . Mrs. Herman pushed her hands into the sand on either side of her and let it drain through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . Think of it ! That one little outlet for the millions who long to pass through . The enormous aching . ' Eve opened the picnic basket and said , We 're going to eat now . Try not to be gloomy , please , when the children are with us . ' Mrs. Herman shifted her eyes . She glanced at her daughter , who looked very handsome kneeling there against the dune . Eve had on red sharkskin slacks and a yellow blouse . A yellow ribbon kept her black hair on top of her head in a casual and becoming pile . Mrs. Herman smiled bitterly and said , Poor Eve . The sky could fall Nonsense . I 'm as aware of things as you are . ' Eve said . But there 's no point , Mother , in all the timeNo , Eve . I know you too well . The sky could really fall and you 'd try to save your china . ' That 's ridiculous ! I simply do n't believe that there 's any point in burdening children , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I feel it as much as you . Everyone does . ' Mrs. Herman 's pale lips twitched . It is not a matter of burdening or not burdening ourselves . We are burdened . ' She stood up and pointed with a thin arm . Form a picture of Europe in your mind . Try to see it . That one open port . The few airplanes and the few ships , the money it costs , and the impossible number of people , and the terrible difficulties . See it as a picture , and you may feel it  --  all of Europe , and all the roads crowded , and all leading there . In spirit if not in body . All crowding down , or yearning to . That longing means nothing to you . It 's only an idea , all of it , only somethingthat you read about . But you 're young . ' Now that Mrs. Herman was standing , the wind blew the light silk material of her white dress and made it flutter.  |p173Sit  down , ' Eve said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is , exactly what I mean . Sand on the cloth ! ' Well , Mother , we 've got to live , after all ! ' Eve cried impatiently . The old woman raised her eyebrows , curiously heavy and dark for her delicate and bony face . Her white forehead wrinkled . Yes , ' she said . Yes , we must . ' Her voice had taken on the excessively rational tone of one who is explaining something to himself . My great-grandfather lived until he was a hundred and eight . ' Oh dear , Mother ! ' Eve groaned , and once more shook out the blue-and-white checkered cloth . Now sit down , for heaven 's sake , or go and help Harold bring back the children . ' But there was no need ; Harold and the children were nearly back . The wind ballooned out the back of Harold 's shirt and plastered his linen slacks against his legs . The children covered their eyes with their hands and bent their naked , brown bodies forward against a peppering of fine sand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then , as the wind dropped , Harold picked up the little girl and said , Come on , Dick , ' and joined the others under the dune . Wind 's rising , ' he said , and looked up at the sky . On the northern horizon puffy white clouds were forming and the color of the ocean had undergone a subtle change . I got sand in my eyes , ' Evvie cried . Here , baby , ' Eve said , and put down the paper plates . She found her handkerchief and said , Lie back and close your eyes . ' She rubbed the child 's lids gently . Now sniff . ' Evvie sniffed and blinked her eyes tentatively . Better ? ' Eve asked . Yes , ' Evvie said . Dickie said scornfully , She 's scared of those old jellyfish . ' They 're not jellyfish , ' Evvie said . They are so ! ' he cried vehemently . Sit down , both of you , ' Eve said . We 're going to have lunch . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ninety , ' Mrs. Herman said abruptly . I 'm only sixty-five . It 's very depressing . ' They all stared at her , and Eve said sharply , What do you want , Mother ? Chicken or ham sandwich ? ' Either , please , ' she said , and then , turning to Evvie with sudden tenderness , she said , Come here , dear . Sit next to me . ' When the little girl had settled down beside her , Mrs. Herman , holding her sandwich up to her mouth , said , You 're right . They 're not jellyfish but just some kind of seaweed . A plant . Do n't let him tease you . ' I know it , ' Evvie said , and looked at Dickie calmly . The Abramses all had very black hair and brilliant black eyes . Mrs. Herman 's hair , though gray , was still streaked with black . Her eyes were dull . Yet now , as they ate their lunch looking out at the ocean , it was her eyes which seemed to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if she were trying to draw the outlines of that city , the door to freedom , out of the vast Atlantic distance . Look , Dickie , ' Eve said . That rock out there is shaped like an elephant , is n't it ? ' Without a trunk , ' Dickie said . Oh , but do n't you see that line on this end , down the front of it ? That 's the trunk . ' Elephant Rock , ' Dickie said . Let 's call it Elephant Rock . ' Then , gulping down his milk , he tossed the paper cup in the air and scrambled up the side of the dune . Sand scatteredthrough the air . Dick ! ' his father shouted . Watch what you 're doing ! ' Dickie , perched above them on the crest of the dune , looked down at Evvie meaningfully and began to chant , I 'm the king of the cas-tle and you 're the dir-ty ras-cal . ' Evvie stared up at him , finished her milk precisely , put down her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her back , marched to the shore.  |p175Dickie  , trying his tune once more without effect , scrambled from the dune and followed her . There 's a lion ! ' he shouted , pointing at the empty beach , and they ran wildly down the shore , both screaming , Lion ! Lion ! ' Each generation dies off a little earlier , ' Mrs. Herman said . There is that much , anyway . Their vitality seems to diminish . My great-grandfather  --  the one who had the bank in Prague  --  he was , as I said , one hundred and eight . My grandfather  --  the first of our family in this country  --  he was ninety-seven . My own father lived to be ninety and my mother eighty-nine . ' They were very chipper old people , ' Harold said . He had taken off a sneaker and was emptying the sand from it . Eve lit a cigarette . That 's a magnificent heritage . What are you lamenting about , for heaven 's sake ? ' She flipped the dead match away impatiently . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . Old people always are . But that is nothing . Think what a burdenthey were to themselves ! How they must have ached sometimesLook where the children have gone , ' Eve said . They were far up the beach . They 're all right , ' Harold said . Do n't worry about them . ' It may storm , and it 's getting chilly , ' Eve said , as she dug into a bathing kit , and their swimming suits are damp . ' She found two sweaters and started up the beach. ... yet they were spared these later horrors , at least , ' Mrs. Herman said . The tide 's going out , ' Harold said . Along the shore , where the water had receded , was a strip of wet sand , and small , white-capped waves were beginning to roll in . At the rock the slapping sounds had changed to long , low thumpings . The clouds on the northern horizon had fanned up and turned gray , and the water was dark green and purple but still glinting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harold said . My husband 's family is very different , ' Mrs. Herman said . Most of them die comfortably in their sixties , the way he did . ' We 'd better get packed up , ' Harold said . Look at that water now . ' What a strange thing ! ' Mrs. Herman said . Here the tide rolls out , and I suppose that means that on the other side it is rolling in . That brings us very close , does n't it ? I never saw Lisbon . I was never in Portugal . I have been abroad seven times and I 've seen many countries . I counted them once . I 've been in twenty-three countries . ' Portugal was never much of a place to go , was it ? ' Harold said , putting the picnic things into the basket and making a pile of the scraps on a piece of newspaper . He looked down the beach at the three figures coming back . Then he glanced at the sky . The sun had abruptly and altogethervanished . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The only door . A little , narrow door , and behind it millions of lives that ca n't possibly squeeze through it , ache as they may . ' We 're going to have to hurry , ' Harold said .

' Eve said as she came up with the children . They were wearing their sweaters . Yes , ' Harold said . Everything 's nearly ready . ' We 'll put your shoes and socks on in the car , children , ' Eve said . Dickie bit his lower lip . You said we could dig clams when the tide went out , ' he complained to his father . I want a starfish , ' said Evvie . Some other day , babies , ' Eve said firmly . She folded the cloth and put it quickly into the basket . Come on , Mother . ' Mrs. Herman stood up slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said.  |p177With  the rising wind , the waves were much higher and the thumping on the rock had changed to a distant booming , like remote thunder , or cannon . Harold said , It sounds far away , does n't it , as though it 's from the horizon somewhere , not from that rock at all ? ' Yes , ' Mrs. Herman said . It 's because the wind 's from the shore , ' Harold said . Let 's go , ' said Eve , nervously . Look at that sky . We 'll be caught . ' She took both children by the hand and hurried them up a dim path in the sand between the dunes . Harold picked up the basket and the kit and followed her . Mrs. Herman looked down at the parcel of scraps , which he had ignored , and listenedfor a moment longer to the waves on the rock . On the dunes , the colors , under the lowering green sky , were curiously intense . The fading gorse was blotched with orange and a poisonous green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as blood . Eve 's clothes , although she was far ahead , were as bright and sharp as if she were only a few steps away . She was carrying one child now and dragging the other behind her , and she was running as if their very lives depended on reaching the car before the rain began . Harold paused to look back , but after signaling to Mrs. Herman , he hurried after his wife . Mrs. Herman did not hurry . She lowered her head a little against the flying sand and trudged along comfortably . Even when the first heavy raindrops splattereddown from the dark sky , she continued to walk as though it did not matter in the least if she were caught in the full torrent which would break loose any moment now.  |p178GEORG  LESSING was a quiet , middle-class Austrian in his late fifties  --  not a man you would notice on the street and certainly not a man you would suppose destined for heroic action  --  who had escaped from Europe with his wife in 1938 ; and they could have lived here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet he is that Lessing whose execution , accompanied by so much brutal ceremony , figured prominently in the Nazi news releases about a month ago . Of the melodrama  --  by what incredible means he managed to get from New York to Vienna in the year 1942  --  I have no more information than the newspapers . They had only the official release  --  that Lessing , an exile in the United States , had succeeded in coming back into Austria and , by careful plotting , managed to shoot six officials , two of them very prominent , from a garret in which he was hiding as their cars drove through the street below ; that it was an extraordinarydisplay of marksmanship for a middle-aged professorwhose eyes were none too good ; and that he was of course immediately arrested and the Reich revenged . According to the interview of our reporters with Frau Lessing in New York , which was published the next day , I found that she had known of his plan and that he had , in going , accepted death . She said that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came and that she had heard nothing from him once he had left . She said he felt that his nerves were shattered , thatp179very soon he would be of no use whatever and that he must do something while he could . But how much of his plan had he revealed to his wife ? the reporters had pressed her . And how long had he been forming it ? She was very indefinite ; but twice she quoted him  --  and the repetition seems significant  --  as saying , One sees one 's duty , at least , nickt wahr ? ' With that curious accent on duty , as if one saw nothing else . And she said too , The sense of duty , it can grow from very personal things , is it not so ? ' Then I remembered . I am certain now that Lessing 's plan was in the making for nearly four years and I am certain that that personal thing underneath his boldness and cunning and the whole extraordinary adventure is so prosaic an item as a pair of spectacles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their son , because of the Nazis , had been trapped in Turkey for years , and their daughter , with her husband , had vanished in France in 1940 . Yet I am sure of the spectacles . What trivial details ultimately underlie the exaltationsof humanity comprise , after all , the whole mystery of ourselves . I had seen how important Lessing 's spectacles were to him ; his only symbol of security , perhaps , in a world that had grown dark and confused and trackless arouild him ; and I had seen him , too , in that moment later when his gray sadness fell from him like old clothes  --  the bright plot suddenlycomplete in his mind  --  and he as radiant as a boy who is about to have everything he has dreamed of . I should say that I saw the Lessings only a few times all together , and that was in 1938 . In September of that year they went to Saint Paul and stayed there for three years , until Herr Lessing 's nerves got the better of him and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came back to New York , and he had been doing well as an adviser on iconography in one of the museums . After 1 read of his death I tried to get in touch with Frau Lessing , but she had already vanished from her basement apartment in Jones Street , andp18o the Manhattan police have not yet found any trace of her . Has she , plump and nearsighted , gone off on some such secret errand as her husband 's , as inappropriately magnificent and bold ? Or , more likely , is she dead , a woman whose life has been systematically robbed of every love , an anonymous suicidein some brown river of the city ? The spectacles take us back to an automobile drive on a very hot day in late August of 1938 . In the back seat , my wife and the Herr Doktor had immediately launched into their reminiscences , but I had not known these people before , and so , at first , there seemed only one subject for Frau Lessing and me to discuss . She felt this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , talking of the past , she took a very bright tone with me about the present . You know , ' she said as soon as we had started , it is rather amusing to change your country . We find it quite amusing . ' So ? ' I asked dubiously . Oh , yes , ' she said lightly , for very young people and for old people , it is quite amusing to make  --  what do you say ?  --  yes , drastic moves . For people of your age , with small children , and a home just starting , it is difficult , but for very young and for old people , it is ' she groped for the word , ' all , stimulating . You say stimulating , yes ? ' She was quite nearsightedand she blinked at me through the thick lenses of her glasses . Yes , ' I said . Stimulating . ' My wife had known these people when they had a large house on a shady street in the outskirts of Vienna , with severalUtrillos on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two of them seated on a sofa , by their friend Kokoschka . I believe that Mrs. Lessing 's grandmother on her father 's side had been a Jewess , and Georg Lessing , a distinguished art historian in the University of Vienna , had inevitably had occasions on which to express publicly his mildly liberalp181views . New York in that summer , and constantly being with other exiles , had depressed them , and so they came to Cambridgein August . Cambridge , as they found at once , is expensiveand by no means cool , and we suggested that , since rest was what they wanted , they let us help them find rooms in the country . They had more than a month before Herr Lessing had to go to Saint Paul . We had not discussed places with them but had decided to drive them to Annisquam first . Then Mrs. Lessing , looking at a bleak row of Cambridge three-deckers as we crept toward Highway IA through snarls of traffic , said , It is the green that I want  --  just the green to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lessing , whose English was more fluent than his wife 's . Not the ocean , but grass . ' No , not water , but the resting green , the grass . ' How about Topsfield ? ' my wife said . We might try Topsfield , ' I said . So we turned into the traffic on Route I.It is only your hat shops , ' Frau Lessing said , that I cannotlike . ' Women 's hats are awful right now , ' I said tritely . Oh , not the styles , ' she said quickly . The styles I like fine . No , no . I mean I can not get a hat to fit me . You see , I have a very big head . ' She laughed . Oh , come , ' I said , any large shop could give you your size . ' Yes ? Yes ? ' she cried in scorn . y4ber nein ! Not even so the very largest . ' You could n't get your size anywhere , really ? ' No . I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this dress  --  yes , this . You like it ? ' It was a casual dress , for the country , of hopsacking , I believe , looking very American . Very nice , ' I murmured . You see , we had no summer clothes at all . '  | You must get my wife to tell you about someone she knows who makes hats . ' Oh , I have had made , yes . You see , this that I wearHer hand went up to the crownless jersey turban which sat on the very top of her head , with the great roll of hair at the back jutting out in a manner not intended for turbans , this is fine . Now all my hats are  --  what do you say ?  --  turbans , yes ? ' Turbans . That 's right . ' You do not think my head large ? ' Not especially . ' But it is , it is ! In my will , I give my brains to the Surgical Institute in Vienna . They never have enough brains to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head is nearly as big as Lenin 's . You believe it ? ' I wanted to laugh but when , between rows of rapidly movingcars , I glanced at her quickly , I saw that she was quite solemn , the blinking , questioning eyes waiting for an answer . ' Well , perhaps , ' I said thoughtfully . Now , of course , the will can not be executed . But now in Vienna there is also no need of brain dissection , is it not so ? ' Yes , ' I said , it is so . ' We were on the very edge of Cambridge , waiting for a traffic light to change . In an empty lot on the corner stood the tents and booths and painted contraptions of a traveling carnival show , all of it looking very faded in the bright sunlight , the Ferris wheel bleakly skeletal against the pale summersky , the organ music from the merry-go-round sounding thin and tired . I heard my wife point out that , yes , this was still Cambridge , that there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes ? ' Herr Lessing was saying . Yes , yes ? Is it so , yes ? ' I saw him lean forward to watch a sailor at a trap-shooting stand , picking off the white clay ducks one by one as they went round on their endless track . His gun was sharp and crackling in-the traffic lull.  |p183Frau  Lessing laughed as we started forward again and , her head cocked , she said , You know , my daughter , Trilla , she has a small , pretty head , and I must tell you now  --  I must tell you of her very amusing experience . ' Yes ? ' I said , falling into their habit . Yes ? ' And through the hot , bleached stretches of Somerville and Everett she told me the story . Now I must tell you , Trilla is very pretty , very charming , ' she began . Trilla , it seems , had married a young Jewish physician some months before , Anschluss and she had rejected a rather well-known Austrian Nazi to do so . Trilla was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her brother , on a passport about to expire , was teaching in Beirut , and the parents were doing research at the British Museum on a sabbatical . On the morning of that famous day in 1938 , March ii , Trilla and her husband boarded a train for Switzerland , their papers in order , but by the time Schuschnigg made his wireless address that evening , they had not yet arrived in Innsbruck because their train had been stopped so often . They got off the train then , abandoning everything but a rucksack each , their skiing clothes , which they put on , and their skis . They skied for three days and two nights and at last came to the border . There were two trails  --  one , they knew , across into Switzerland , the other back into Austria ; but they did not know which was which . At a customs shack near-by , they boldly asked for the trail back into Austria . One of the young men in charge took a look at Trilla and offered to take them back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of hours of desperate flirtation , with the young husband making himself as inconspicuous as possible , and a dozen efforts to shake off the ardent guide . At last , only because he had to pursue three people obviously in flight did he abandon them . That night , in the darkness , they escaped.  |p184And  so now she is in France , and her passport too is aboutto expire , but she is very pretty , very charming , and they stillhave a little money .... I think it will be all right , yes ? ' What is that , please ? ' Lessing asked . It 's an outdoor movie , ' my wife said . You drive in and sit in your car and watch the picture . ' Outdoor movie ? So ? ' Frau Lessing said eagerly and then , abruptly , chagrined , flch , Georg ! ' I glanced into the reflector . Herr Lessing 's face had gone quite pale and he was searching desperately through his pockets . My glasses ! ' he said to no one , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my wife said , looking there herself . He bent down too , and his hands ran rapidly over the floor of the car in a frenzy . Behind you , under you ! ' his wife cried nervously . Frantically he searched the seat . No , ' he said , No , Ursula . Gott ! ' Did you have them ? Are you certain you had them ? ' my wife asked . Gewiss , gewiss , ' he said impatiently . Always I have them . ' I drew up to the side of the road  --  we were more or less in the country by this time  --  and shut off the engine . The man was frightfully upset , and I was already wondering how much glasses cost . In his budget , clearly , they would be no small item . Stupidly I echoed my wife . You 're sure you had them ? ' He looked at me with stricken eyes and his wife answered for him . Ach , ja , ' she said , in her own nervousness lapsing completely into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gerade hier . ' She put her hand on her breast to indicate the inner pocket of a man 's jacket and added , Always he has them . He is so careful . They are most important . ' I climbed out of the car and said , Let me look . ' But our search , which at Herr Lessing 's plea involved the removal ofp185the tightly fitted rear seat , was fruitless . I said , We 'll go back and see if you forgot them . ' I did not forget , I did not forget , I did not , I know , forget . ' By this time his head was in his hands . Ach , Georg , ' his wife mumbled sympathetically , almost as stricken as he , but when she caught my eye on her , she laughed . It is so silly , in one way ; his glasses are so weak  --  what do you say ?  --  compared ?  --  yes , compared to mine . It is so silly .... ' I made a quick U-turn and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miserable , and Herr Lessing was making another even more frantic search through his clothing . Try to imagine , I kept telling myself , how important ten or fifteen or twenty dollars are when you have so little . And still , it all seemed quite excessive , I thought . Tell me , ' I said , trying to make conversation , did Herr Lessing have his appointment here before you left England ? ' She looked at me in surprise . But of course , ' she said . Otherwise we could not have come without guarantors , or so quickly . They would not have let us in , you know .... ' Of course , ' I said . It 's for a year ? ' A year at a time , yes . That is a long time now in our lives . ' Yes , ' I said , beginning to thread our way back through the horrible suburban traffic . I was driving too fast but I had a feeling that everyone in the car wanted me to drive faster . It must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unable to get back , your house just gone like that , and everything you owned , really , was n't it ? ' She smiled . ' So that I had not even one summer dress . ' Yes . ' It was not happy , ' she said , and yet it was , too . There was only one thing that we really had to have from our house . Now I must tell you that the first half of my husband 's new book was already written . We were working on the second half , you see ? And the first half  --  I do not know why , butp186we had been stupid enough to leave it . It was all in the man . uscript still and so bulky . It is to be a very large book , you see ? ' You mean he 'll have to rewriteOh , but no ! He went back . ' I looked at her . What ? ' Yes . He went back . He got it . Everything in the house had been  --  what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our picturesgone , our silver , my clothes , his academic gown  --  but the manuscript , that was there , scattered over the floor . How dull they must have found it . ' Oh , but how fortunate ! ' She looked at me , her wise eyes blinking . Yes ? ' she said . Yes ? Yes ? ' Well , was n't it ? ' He was gone for two months , you see . I did not hear from him , I did not know what had happened . That was not happy , yes ? ' I saw him in the reflector . He was sitting in one corner of the seat , very erect yet somehow crushed there , his head lifted yet his face gray with misery . He was not listening to my wife 's chatter . I began to wonder if I could find the money for new glasses and if he would let me ... He caught my eye in the mirror , and before I looked away , I saw him pull himself together and smile in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this city of Saint Paul , you know it ? ' I 've been there . It 's pleasant , I guess . ' And then we all gave up trying . We were in Somerville . I began to cut through traffic like a police car and ran a red light and every yellow one . Then at last we drew up before the student rooming house where the Lessings were staying . Herr Lessing leaped out before I could help him . He stumbled up the shabby steps . The door , with its blank lace curtain , closed behind him . Frau Lessing , peering through her heavy glasses , lookedp187searchingly at each of us , first at my wife and then at me . At last she looked down at her hands , gripped together in her lap . I must tell you now , ' she said , those two months that he did not come back to England ... You see , he was seized at once ; he was in Dachau for seven weeks . You know Dachau , yes ? They let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ con  --  convinced ?  --  ' both of us nodded vigorously , when he convinced them that he had employment in America and that men of importance here were expecting him . You see , in the end it was all right ; but at first ... Now I must tell you , the first thing that they did to him on the train to the camp was to tear his glasses from his face and step on them . You see , that hurt him , and now when he does not have them he is like that , afraid .... ' We saw him come running down the steps . The glasses were on his face . All of us sighed and then smiled . So stupid , ' he muttered as he climbed back in , so stupid of me . You forgive , yes ? ' It was nothing . ' I 'm so glad you found them , ' my wife said . I started the motor and I heard him saying pleasantly to my wife , When you were with us that time , did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I was wondering just now ... No ? She is He was making a notable effort to steady himself . Now I must tell you , ' Frau Lessing was saying to me , , now I must tell you about our son , Brendl , and his very amusing experience . I must tell you that Brendl is very  --  what do you say , alert ?  --  yes ! So it was that Brendl had  --  but first I must tell you ... ' Everyone but Lessing seemed very happy now , when his voice , deeply troubled , explaining to my wife , broke in . It is just nerves . So stupid , to have to depend on anything that way . Like spectacles ... ' Brendl  --  ' Mrs. Lessing was saying loudly . I must tell you nowp188Lessing 's hand touched my shoulder . That place where the sailor was shooting  --  could we stop there ? ' Ach , Georg , ' his wife cried , the country , we must get onNo , no , ' he said , it is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we stop , yes ? I must train my sight . To learn to hit a small target , that would be good for the sight , yes ? Could we stop ? I want to see Y'Of course , ' I said . Why not ? ' To shoot at those clay ducks , that would be good , yes ? We will , then ? ' Certainly . Glad to . ' And that was the moment in which his quiet , saddened face turned radiant . Astonished , I saw it in the mirror and I saw his wife and mine turned toward him , staring . Believe me , he was a different man.  |p189IT  WAS ONLY eight o'clock in the morning , but Sara Thorntoncame to breakfast in her hat , an early spring model , brilliant red , with a wide brim that fanned off the face to accommodate her soft brown pompadour . The red hat was in sharp contrast to her cocoa-brown suit . Kick me , Jack , ' she said to her husband . I 've made a hideous mistake . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mummie ? ' Sage , their six-year-old son , asked . Where you going , Mummie ? ' asked Susan , the **27;2085;TOOLONG sat beside him . Do n't echo , Susan , ' Sara said . She kissed them both abstractedly on the top of the head and sat down and opened her napkin . I 'm coming to school with you , ' she said . Are you really ? ' Sage cried , bouncing up and down on his chair . I could die , ' Sara said . What can she think of me ? ' Jack watched her drink her orange juice . Who ? ' he asked . Mrs. Crawford . She 's what 's called the class parent ... Oh , good morning , Nellie . ' Nellie , the Thorntons ' servant , took the empty orangejuiceglass and put down a plate with a poached egg and toast , and went out . Start at the beginning , ' Jack said . Well , I had two bundles , ' Sara began , one full of discardedchildren 's clothing for the school 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practically all in rags and not children 's clothing at all but an old jacket of yours out at the elbows , some shrunken old flannels , my old green house coat , and  --  oh God , it 's sickening !  --  some torn woollen underpantsof mine ! Not even washed . Of course they were n't washed . Why should they have been ? ' What was that for ? ' Salvage ! And that bundle went to the school three days ago . I just discovered the right bundle still in my closet . ' Sage broke in . We have to give things to The Poor that we really like , otherwise it is n't giving , is it ? ' The voice of Miss T. , ' Sara muttered to Jack . Sage looked from one of his parents to the other . I know who Miss T. is , ' he said . It 's Miss Thomas . ' No , Sage , ' Sara said , it is not . And Sage , you will have to learn not to interrupt us if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the kitchen again . ' I do n't pay three hundred dollars a year to what 's supposedto be a liberal school just to get back nineteenth-centuryideas like that one ! ' Jack exclaimed . The Poor ! ' I know , Jack , ' Sara said quickly , warning him with a glance . I 'm going into that with Miss Thomas this morning if I have a chance . ' Do I know any of The Poor , Daddy ? ' Sage asked . Yes , ' said Jack , glancing at his watch . ' Very well . Me . ' Finish your milk , Susan , ' Sara said , but Susan slid under the table and Sara turned to Jack again . The school was very explicit about what it wanted . Children 's clothing only , and it had to be in good condition and clean . It was supposedto be attractive ' ' Where does Mrs. Crawford come in ? ' She 's in charge of the collection from Sage 's class . Sorts it out and so on . If it were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' I know Timmy Crawford , ' said Sage . He 's on my side . '  |p191I  know Timmy Crawford , ' said Susan , who was sitting under the table untying her shoelaces . You do not know Timmy Crawford , either ! ' Sage shouted scornfully . Sage ! Quiet ! ' Sara cried . She turned to Jack again . Why ? Because the Crawfords are rolling in money and she has four servants , who give her plenty of leisure to look like the perfect , thoughtful mother , not to say the perfect , thoughtful liberal who runs a half-dozen worthy committees . Have n't you ever seen their house ? It 's supposed to have ten bathrooms . ' Have you ever seen it ? ' Often  --  from the outside , ' Sara said as she pushed the last bit of egg on the last bit of toast and put it angrily in her mouth . Do n't you see ? She probably wo n't even see that it is a mistake ! ' Why are you going to the school ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women like Mrs. Crawford who are responsible for the atmosphere which producesthe p-o-o-r . ' P-o-o-r , ' Sage spelled after her . I know ! Poor . The Poor . ' The poor , the poor , the poor , ' sang Susan , still under the table , where she was fingering the suede bows on her mother 's shoes . Be careful of my stockings , Susan , ' Sara said with irritation . In fact , get up off the floor . For heaven 's sake , Susan . Come here . ' She took the child 's hand and pulled her out from under the table . You and Sage go to the kitchen and let Nellie help you on with your coats and things . ' The children went out and Jack said , I still think we should have sent them to a public school . Is this America or is n't it ? ' Darling , ' Sara said , I believe in the public-school system just as much as you do . But everyone knows that the public schools in this town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's a disservice to a child ' Figure it out . Two hundred dollars for Susan in a nursery group , three hundred for Sage in first grade . It 'll be five hundred dollars apiece by the time they get to the eighth grade . Aside from the little problem of where it 's coming from , what are they getting for it ? ' Oh , Jack , that 's not fair . They get a lot . Leafy Lane really does train for citizenship in a democracy  - -  Y'My idea , ' Jack said , is that when you 're paying that kind of money , you 're buying something else . Timmy Crawford 's company , I guess . ' He glanced at his watch again . I 've got to go . Give ' em hell . ' That 's just the point , Jack , ' Sara said eagerly . The fact that I can , the fact that the school asks for parent criticism , shows that Mrs. Crawford is not the school . It really is ' He kissed her before she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . See you tonight . ' Good-bye , darling , ' she said , swallowed the last of her coffee , and called to the kitchen , Hurry , children ! ' Leafy Lane School consisted of ten low , new buildings and a playing field safely enclosed within a wall . The building had been weatherproofed but not painted and , in spite of the expert architecture and planning , looked casual , almost homely . Sara Thornton came through the gate with her two children , and carrying a bulky brown package by the string . She left the children at the door of the main building , where they attended the morning assembly of twenty minutes , and proceeded briskly along a winding gravel walk until she came to the first-grade building . Oh , good morning , Miss Thomas . I 'm so glad I found you . ' Miss Thomas , a young woman with colorless hair andglasses , was on her knees sorting a pile of large finger paintings . Oh , good morning , Mrs. Thornton . ' She stood up andp193smoothed out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't expect you . The office always lets us know ' Oh , I 'm not really visiting . I came about something else . About that package I sent up with Sage  --  the charity things . I 've just found I sent the wrong one . This is the right one . ' Miss Thomas took the package . You can leave this , but I 'm afraid the others have gone . ' Mrs. Crawford ? ' Sara asked tentatively . Yes . She 's taken them all home with her . ' Oh , dear . ' She must have them still . You could call her . ' Yes , I could , ' Sara said as she glanced unhappily at a row of paintings fastened on one wall . Those are nice , ' she said . Some of them really do very well , ' Miss Thomas answered . She put the package on top of the schoolroom piano . Any of Sage 's ? ' Sara asked casually . ' Well , no . There are n't any up now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't matter . ' Miss Thomas glanced at her . Well , it does , really , ' she said . As a matter of fact , Mrs. Thornton , I 've been wanting to have a chat with you about Sage . Sit down a moment , wo n't you ? ' She pointed to a child 's chair , and after Sara sat down on it , her knees awkwardly high , Miss Thomas pulled up another chair like it and sat facing her . Sage is n't doing as well as he should , you know . He is apparently unwilling to concentrate . He seems to lack direction or any real interest in what he 's doing . ' I do n't see ' Sara started crossly . I 'll show you , ' Miss Thomas said . She knelt before the stack of paintings , quickly leafed through them , and laid two at Sara 's feet . This is Sage 's , ' she said , pointing to a chaotic mass of muddy colors , and this is the little Jackson child 's , a child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performance , you see.  | Sara looked at a skeletal but recognizable locomotive passingover a rudimentary trestle . I see , ' she said . When Sage paints , ' Miss Thomas went on , he rushes , as he does with everything . In the shop , or if you watched him with blocks , or his impatience with numbers , or when we do a little spelling , or rhythms  --  it 's all the same . A mad scrambleto finish a chore which has no interest for him . ' Is n't it the business of the school to give him direction , Miss Thomas ? ' Sara asked coldly . Yes , ' Miss Thomas said , but we must have the co-operationof the parents . I 've noticed , for instance , that you have n't been here nearly as often as most of the parents . ' Sara stared at her . Please do n't be offended . Of course you do n't neglect him consciously . He 's your child . But do you make him feel that he has a place in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for granted . But no more easy than it is for a child to get the feeling that he 's an outcast in an alien , adult world , neglected , even a burden , you know , a poor unfortunate ' Poor ? ' Sara echoed sharply . And then he may lose his whole sense of purpose , begin to make all sorts of complex compensations , identifications , develop anxieties I'I wanted to speak to you about something , too , Miss Thomas , ' Sara interrupted , but then , without warning , the door flew open and the class began to file in . To your lockers ! ' Miss Thomas shouted cheerfully , and , turning to the piano , struck out a series of martial chords . Sara watched the children troop past her . At the end of the line came Sage . When he saw her , he stopped . My mummie ! ' he shouted loudly , and the children turned to look at her . He ran and threw his arms about her thighs . Why , Sage ! ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' He looked up at her doubtfully and followed reluctantly after the line to the lockers in the next room.  |p195How  happy he was to find you here ! A display of interest is all ' Well , thank you , Miss Thomas , ' Sara said severely . I 'll come another time soon . ' But you wanted to ask me ' Oh , not now that the children are back . And I do have to see Miss Graham for a moment . ' Outside , on the gravel path , Sara began immediately to compose the remarks she would make to the head of the school . I meant to take this up with Miss Thomas , but I doubt if she 'd understand me . Leafy Lane is supposed to be liberal , is n't it , interested in our society , in today , in preparingour children to live in the twentieth century ? But Miss Thomas seems to have some curiously outmoded ideas . Ever since the school 's charity was first mentioned to him , my child has been talking incessantly about something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him , a six-year-old ? Some strange abstraction , the sort of notion one might have picked up in a Victorian boarding school . It does n't seem either realistic or liberal . You know , Miss Graham , someone has called this the people 's century . In another year we may all be penniless . Certainly it is not the time in history to instillin children such patronizing attitudes . The very smugnessof that term  --  " The Poor ! " I must say that the whole thing shocks me deeply . ' Sara was at the main building and very angry . She went firmly through the door and into the office . I 'm Mrs. Thornton . May I see Miss Graham , please ? ' she said to the girl at the desk . Miss Graham 's busy just now . Wo n't you wait ? ' Sara sat down . She took off her hat and put it on the chairbeside her . She would not wear it or even take it into MissGraham 's office . Then she remembered Mrs. Crawford . May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me call your number . '  | Would you ? I want to speak to Mrs. Crawford . ' The girl looked at a list tacked over her desk and dialled a number . She asked for Mrs. Crawford and after a moment she said , Mrs. Crawford ? ... This is the school . Mrs. " Thornton would like to speak to you . ' She handed the instrument to Sara . Mrs. Crawford ? ... I 'm so embarrassed . I ca n't imagine what you must think of me .... It 's about that bundle my child brought for the charity . Have you opened it ? ... Oh , good ! I 'm so relieved . You see , I made a ridiculous error . The real bundle is here now , but the one you have is full of perfectly useless things . Could I get it ? ... For tea ? This afternoon ? Oh , I 'd love it ! ... Why , how sweet of you ! Of course I 'll bring him . He 'd adore it . He talks about Timmy all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' She was smiling when she put the instrument down , and she said Thank you ' to the girl in a warm , happy voice . Miss Graham should be free any moment . I 'm sorry to keep you . ' But Sara was putting on her hat . I do n't think I will wait now . I can see her another time . It 's not really importantat all . '  | 0 NE SUNDAY MORNING Sara Thornton awoke to the usual sound of ack-ack above her , loud and sharply explosive , an expert imitation by her six-year-old son , Sage , who could apparently think of no better way to greet the morning . Sara looked at the clock on her bedtable : ten minutes to seven . She groaned and began to pull the covers over her head when Jack said , Good God ! ' My wonderful bedroom , ' she muttered . What a laugh ! ' The morning light sifted through the slats of the blinds and laid stripes of sunlight on the burgundy walls , across the arched Victorian grate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although Sara 's bedroom was not quite the retreat she had planned it  --  the four-story house was old , and the walls and ceilings thin  --  it was the most attractive room in the house because the children were never allowed to enter it . It representedthe principle of personal rights . Order and charm were preserved here , and at least a degree of quiet , and , as well , an important air of dalliance and domestic romance . To this sanctuary the Thorntons fled the household to have a quiet cocktail or to listen to the news over Sara 's white portable radio in relative peace . The ack-ack ceased and Susan , the three-and-a-half year old , sang shrilly and deliberately in her bed above them , One , two , three , four , five , six , seven , forty . ' Jack laughed . That sweet , silly girl . ' Sara looked at him . It was only when he first awoke , withp198his black stubble unshaved and his hair rumpled and stiff , that Jack still seemed as young to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sweet monsters , ' she said . Look what they 've done to us . And to all our lovely plans . All that traveling we were going to do . ' An unnatural mother , ' he said . What happened to that scheme of spending an occasional week-end in a hotel , to get away from it all ? ' What did ? How about next week-end ? ' Good . Nellie can manage them on Saturday , and I 'll get someone for Sunday . Maybe Helen will . ' Eleven , eleven , eleven , eleven , ' Susan was screaming . Eleven , eleven , twenty , eleven . ' In Sage 's room , loud thumpings began . What 's that ? ' He 's getting into his foxhole , ' Sara said resignedly , and then , when the rat-tat-tat of machine-gun fire began , she said , Damn it , ' and got up . What Sunday mornings used to be ! ' Jack watched her hastily pull on a quilted robe . It is n't worth it , ' she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stairs . Susan ! Sage ! Get dressed ! ' she called sharply . When she came back , she closed the window , adjusted the blinds , and sat down before her dressing table . Jack lay on his back with his arms behind his head and watched her brush her brown hair . Well , ' he said after a wide yawn , let 's get them out and give the Moores a treat . ' The Moores ! I forgot all about them . Were n't they nasty ? " The right to a little peace . " Is n't that what he said ? Really ! ' she cried angrily , turning to look at him , her brush stopped against the curled ends of her hair at her shoulder . Very nasty . ' I have no intention of worrying about the Moores , ' shep199said firmly , and winced as the sounds of power-diving came piercingly through the ceiling . Speak to the child , Jack . Make him dress ! ' After breakfast , Sara went out into the yard with the children to unlock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stared at the apartment building which abutted the Thorntons ' tiny garden and towered over the row of houses in which they lived . Behind some of those countless windows lived the wretched Moores , who had complained of the noise the children made outside , and who were no doubt peering down at her now . She tugged at a yellow steam shovel which was too heavy for Sage to lift , and glanced down the . stairs at the collection of engines and metal instrumentsand machines , all capable of considerable noise , but every one the perfect right of any child . When she came in , she said , I hope those Moores did n't think I brought the children in right away because they telephoned . It was their suppertime . I would have brought them right in anyway . ' Are you worrying ? ' Jack asked . Not in the least . But how really unnatural ! ' she exclaimed . They had hardly finished their coffee when Sage appeared in the dining room with Susan trailing after him . We want to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . ' Cold ! Why , Sage , the sun and air will make you big and strong . You want to grow up to be a commando , do n't you ? ' Yes , but  --  We want to play upstairs . ' We want to play upstairs , ' said Susan . Nonsense ! ' Sara said crossly , and then , taking a very patient tone , Sage , listen to me . You know this is Sunday , do n't you ? ' Yes . ' Well , who does n't come on Sundays ? '  | Nellie . ' That 's right . And I have to do all of Nellie 's work . And you and Susan must help me , Sage , or we 'll all get angry and impatient with each other , wo n't we ? ' But we 're cold , and we want to play upstairs . ' Sara 's lips tightened . But Sage , you will only help me if you play out of doors . And later this afternoon who will come to read to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yes . So come along now . ' She tried to take his hand , but he edged away . ' Come along , ' she said again . He backed toward the wall . No . ' Why , you naughty boy ! ' she cried angrily . I will not have you imposing on your father and me . ' She seized his hand and pulled him out of the room with her . Susan trailed silently along behind them . Jack , who had been reading the Sunday Times , looked up when he heard the commotion . Presently Sara returned . There , ' she said , that 's settled . ' After Sara had stacked the dishes , and just after she had put the children 's lunch  --  peanut-butter sandwiches , salad , milk , and stewed prunes  --  before them at the kitchen table , the doorbell rang . She wiped her hands on a tea towel , pulled off her smock , and went to answer it . She opened the door to a stranger . Mrs. Thornton ? ' the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' she said . Jack came down the stairs behind her . Hello , Thornton , ' the man said , I 'm Moore . ' He put out his hand . Jack said , Oh , ' and shook hands with him . Come in ? ' Well ' the man hesitated . I came to apologize aboutcalling you yesterday . Thought I might have seemed rude . ' Well , come in , ' Jack said . It 's cold out . ' He was quite a tall man , in his early forties , thin , slightlyp201stooped , a little bald . His hands nervously turned his hat round and round . He smiled bleakly and said , I thought I ought to explain . ' Yes , ' Sara agreed , staring at him . Perhaps you do n't realize how noise carries back there . We 're on the third floor of the apartment building , all our rooms on the back , you see . So there 's no way of escaping the sounds . And you people , living in this block of tall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is concentrated by the two walls , and apparently it has to go up , all of it up , and it gets amplified , because of the peculiar relationship of this block of houses and our building , and , well ' Sara said , We 've lived here for two years and no one has ever complained . ' The man smiled . I 'm an accoustical engineer . But I do n't think I 'm unusually sensitive to sound . ' He laughed uneasily . The Thorntons stared at him . Sara said , And your wife  --  she 's an accoustical engineer too ? ' The man stopped smiling . The noises are very disturbing . It is n't that I do n't like children , I do . But all morning , ever since eight ' Do you have any ? ' Sara asked sharply . No . ' You 're new here ? ' Why , yes . We 've lived in France mostly . I worked with the Televox people . Now we 're here , and we 've just got settled in this apartment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't bear excessive noises ' Jack said , Every sound our children have ever made has been perfectly normal . ' It 's only , ' the man began to explain , the way it carries . There must be something peculiar about the particular relationof our apartment to the entire area of sound , you see ' I do n't see , Mr. Moore , ' said Sara.  | He looked at his bony hands twisting his hat . Mrs. Moore thought if you could keep them out of the yard just part of the weekend . Take them out to the park or some-thing ' This is a noisy city , Mr. Moore , ' Sara said . Perhaps you and your wife should live in the country . ' I work here , ' he said , with difficult hours . I need to rest on the weekend . ' Who does n't work ? ' Jack asked . He tried once more . Please come and listen . Please come to our apartment and listen . It 's probably quite different ' I know my children 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have to take some action . My wife What action ? ' Jack demanded at once . Why , the police , I suppose . ' Sara opened the door . Good-bye , Mr. Moore , ' she said , and after he stepped out , she closed it immediately behind him . Then at once she said to Jack , We have to get to the police before he does . Now . That 's the only thing . Complainabout them . This is outrageous , but if they went first , they 'd have the advantage . ' Oh , I do n't think they 'll go . Not that fellow . ' Listen , Jack , ' Sara said , I can see his wife . I know that type . Childless , neurotic , spoiled , lived all her life in Paris , everything her way . And now she 's going to tell me how to deal with my children . The gall ! I slave , and she frets . Listen , you 've got to go right down there . ' She seized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jack ? ' Sure , ' he said , but let 's have lunch first . ' Later in the afternoon , Jack came in , dropped his hat in the hall , and went quickly upstairs . Baby , ' he said in the living room , you can stop fuming . He was wonderful . The name is Murphy . '  |p203What  happened ? ' Sara dropped her book . Would n't Murphy love children ? You should have been there . He would n't even let me finish the story . " What are back yards for if they are n't for kids ? " he wanted to know . " Listen , Mr. Thornton , " he said , " the next time those peopledisturb you , you call me , personally . Do n't you take anything from them , just refer them to me , see ? " ' Oh , Jack , that 's lovely ! ' I said , " Lieutenant Murphy , is an American to be penalizedfor having children ? And by someone who has n't even been living in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Where are they ? ' They 've been out all afternoon , and not a peep from the Moores . ' Jack and Sara went to the back of the house and looked down . The gardens on either side of the Thornton yard , tiny as they were and in spite of the ugly red board fences between them , were really gardens , with tidy evergreens and a laurel or two , brick paths , and brick borders to mark off grass and neat flower beds in spring and summer ; but the Thornton garden was only a yard , its vegetation and order long devastatedby the onslaughts of the children . Even now Sage was working furiously at the last fragments of concrete which had formed some more enterprising tenant 's bird bath , his shovel efficiently uprooting them and presently tossing up a few random pounds of earth . Then he crouched in the shallow hole which he had achieved and pulled a curious contraption of narrow strips of wood in after him . Aiming this at Susan , who was busily and clangingly hurling the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rat-tat-tat of machine gunning began once more . Then suddenly the areaway was echoing with shouts and screams , Sage crying , Fall down , you dope ! You 're dead ! ' and Susan , furiously and shrilly , insisting that she was not . The telephone rang . Sara watched Jack as he listened top204the voice , his mouth twitching angrily and then smiling in a rather nasty way as he said , You go right ahead , ' and put the receiver down firmly before the voice had stopped . He laughed . Do n't we really plan to co-operate about those children ? If not , the Moores are going to get up a petition to run us out of the neighborhood . Oh , Lieutenant Murphy ! ' He dialled the telephone , and while they waited for an answer , they heard the children below suddenly chanting loud and clear their wild version of God Bless America . Where 'd they get that ? ' Jack asked . School , I guess . ' Lieutenant Murphy , please , ' Jack was saying . Hello ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you this afternoon .  --  Yes , that 's right .  --  Yes , just now . They 're threatening a petition to force us to move .  --  Yes , sir .  --  You can ? You will ? That 's fine .  --  Thank you , sir . ' He chuckled . Lieutenant Murphy will be right over to wait on the Moores . He 's going to tell them who will move , if anyone does . ' Oh , dear , ' Sara said . I 'm worried . ' Why ? ' Remember the old lady who used to live on the third floorof that building , Jack ? I was just thinking . They , are noisy , of course . That old lady used to wave at them out of her window at first , and make faces , and once or twice she told me how sweet they were . But then she stopped , and one day when I was out there with them , she opened her window , with her hand on her gray hair , and she said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed . Sure , they 're noisy . All kids are . ' And you think it will be all right ? ' With Murphy ? Baby ! ' The sounds of God Bless America rose to a high and faltering crescendo . Sara listened . I know , When will he be there ? '  |p205The  station 's a couple of blocks away . He was furious . He 'll be right along if I know my Murphies . Why ? ' Sara was on her way to the storeroom on the top floor of the house , and when she came down , she waved a small American flag at him . She rushed to the kitchen , opened the door to the yard , called in the children , said ' Do you think I 'm crazy , Helen ? ' to the high-school girl at the sink as she hastily picked over the pots on the pantry shelf , and gave each child a firm kiss on the cheek . Look , Mummy 's thought up a game . That 's a lovely song you were singing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sing ? It 's a patrioticsong , you know . Susan , you can carry this flag and march in front . And here , Sage , is a drum for you to keep time on . You must both sing . Helen , give me that metal ladle . There . Is n't that a good idea ? ' The children , who were accustomed to thinking up their own games , beamed with pleased surprise . Sage beat tentativelyon the bottom of his kettle , which made a very satisfactorysound , and Susan began to sing shrilly , From the mount  --  ings , to the prair  --  eee ... ' Now , outside with you . March round and round the yard . ' The Thorntons peered down from behind glass curtains . The parade was a triumph , loud , seemingly endless . Presentlya heavy red hand pulled back curtains on the third floor of the apartment building , and a man 's large face appeared at the window . He smiled , and then he scowled , and broad shoulders swung round forbiddingly as he faced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other with pleasure , watched the hand appear and reappear before the window , stubby index finger out , in a gesture which could demonstrate only the utter innocence of the scene below . And they listened to the high , relentless voices of their children with delight . I 'm going upstairs , Jack , ' Sara said afterwards . Get us a drink . Helen will bring the children in. '  |p2o6  When Jack came up to Sara 's room , everything was cozy . The blinds were closed against the twilight , a fire was glowing in the grate , the lamps with their white shades were lit , and Sara was looking lovely and rested and happy , stretched out on her lounge in a white negligee . Oh , dear , ' Sara sighed . Was it mean of me to getup that parade ? He was such a mild , timid man , in a way ' Mean ? Listen , darling , ' Jack said as he poured their martinis , we could n't match them for meanness . You had the word for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Through the open door , the sharp sounds of the children 's high voices rose from the living room below . They were quarreling about who was to have the first story . It 's my turn , ' Sage was insisting . No , mine , ' cried Susan . My turn , Helen , tonight . ' No , my turn , Helen . ' Close the door , Jack , ' Sara said . He closed the door , handed her a cocktail , and sat down at her feet . Everything was quiet now , and charming . The coals in the grate crackled comfortably . Sara stretched her legs against Jack and sighed again . They just do n't like children , ' she said . If they did , they 'd have some . ' You know , Sara , ' Jack said , I guess I never felt like a parent before . ' He laughed . Rising furiously to protect my young . Sara , who was sipping her cocktail , suddenly frowned . ' But why should I hate them so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? I mean , if they are just eccentrics , they should probably be pitied . But I do n't pity them in the least . I loathe them , as though they meant something to me . I really do loathe them . '  |p207THEY  HAD FINISHED LUNCH , they had stopped laughing , and now the three of them sat in silence at therestaurant table . The middle-aged man in the blue , pin-striped suit stared into his empty highball glass , and the middle-aged woman in the black dress with the rose in red sequins on her shoulder drew parallel lines on the cloth with her index finger , and the boy with the brown hair cut like a brush stared at the ceiling and whistled without making any sound . Suddenly he stood up . I have to go , ' he said . His father pushed himself up rather awkwardly and swayed a bit on his feet . He was a big man , as tall as his son but heavier , with a brown face that clearly had always been stronger than the boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Frankie , ' he said . The boy struggled into a wrinkled reversible coat and reached for his worn brown hat . Do n't take it so hard , ' he said humorously . The father forced a smile . Hard ? Hell , Frankie , I 'm not taking it hard . Why , Frankie , I 'm as proud as  --  Do n't I know you 're going to show ' em what ' Okay , ' the boy said deprecatingly and glanced at his wrist-watch . I 'll be late . ' He turned to the woman . Well , good-bye , Louise . I 'll be seeing you . ' They shook hands and suddenly he bent down and put his cheek against hers . Good-bye , Frankie , ' she said , and when he turned to his father again , she dabbed at her eyes with her handkerchief.  | ' Good-bye , Dad . ' Good-bye , boy , ' his father said and put his arm around the boy 's shoulder . Frankie stood still for a moment , then moved abruptly away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the restaurant . His father remained standing until the boy went past the windows , his head ducked into the drizzling rain . It was pleasant in the soft smoky light , with waitresses treading about silently , the soft sounds of silver and glass on linen , low voices at lunch time , and the rain falling silently in mist outside . The street , through the tall windows , was faint and remote , the rain drifting in thin clouds across the hard buildings opposite , blurring vehicles , softening the outlinesof people who passed , and the whole street . It was all pleasant , all subdued , and the man 's voice had some of that soft quiet in it when he said , He called you Louise . ' He 's always called me Louise , ' she said . You never notice anything . ' A waitress came to their table when the man signaled to her and he ordered more whisky . You were always good to him , ' lie said to the woman . ' Jesus , for nine years now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' He was always away at school , ' she said . Oh , but the times in between . Holidays . You made his home , such as it is ' And camp in the summers , ' she said . You were good to him . And you 've been pretty sweet to me . Do n't think I do n't know it . ' She looked up at him and smiled painfully . Do n't talk so loud . ' He put his hands on the edge of the table , pushed his back up straight , threw out his big shoulders , and , with dark anger in his handsome , tired face , stared about him . He said , I mean it . You 've been pretty nice . I 'm grateful too . ' Andp209when she did not answer , he added , A time like this  --  when something like this happens , it makes you think . How lucky you 've been , or unlucky . What you 've had in your life . What you have n't had . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had a full pink face , a worried mouth , and redrimmed , uneasy eyes . She was a little plump , and looked embarrassed , as if she felt out of place , and kept glancing at the people round her . Whenever she moved her head a small red plume on her hat nodded and shook . The waitress put down two jiggers of whisky , glasses witli ice , some soda . The man drank his straight , in a swallow , and looking into the glass , he said , Poor Frankie . He wo n't be home for a while now . ' No , not for awhile , I guess . Still , he 'll have furloughs Home , ' the man said . He looked up from his drink . Hemust have known about us . He must 've always known . ' You should have gone to the Induction Center with him . It would have been nicer . ' This was easier , ' the man said , and presently , again , He must 've always known . Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman said . You never worried about anything that had to do with Frankie . And he does n't know . I know he does n't . ' Frankie is n't stupid . He knows , all right . And is n't that something dandy to remember when he 's in a tough spot , when he 's got a bullet in his stomach , or when his legs are crushed , when he 's lying alone on a hard field somewhere , or on hot sand , and something sweet is what he needs . ' Frankie , ' she said . He looked so white ' He stared at her moodily , and his broad mouth twitched just before he said , Stop that , ' coldly and deliberately . What ? ' Picking at that cloth . Why do n't you take care of your hands ? Spend a dollar and get a manicure . '  | She put her hands quickly in her lap and said , Let 's go . ' She picked up the white cloth gloves that lay beside her dessertplate . Take it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had too much now . ' Ahh  --  ' he said , and batted his hand toward her . She sat staring , and neither spoke for a while . The man ordered another drink , and when the waitress left their table , he said , You ought to get somebody to help you buy your clothes . ' Why are you nagging at me ? ' she murmured . What have I done ? Just after you 've been saying how grateful --  That flower . ' She flinched , and again both of them stared at the table . Finally the man said , Frankie will do all right . He 's in good shape . Frankie 's a fine athlete . ' Yes , ' she agreed . Do you know anything about it ? ' Do n't talk so loud . ' He looked round him defiantly . I 'll tell the world , ' he said , if I feel like it . He 's one swell kid . ' Sure he is , ' she said . No one 's arguing . ' He would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have stayed there . He 's a great swimmer . I taught him . ' Did you ? ' He shook his head from side to side , remembering , and smiled . When he was about so high . But husky as a kid could be , and rangy , too . Before you saw him , long before that . When we used to go to a place in the Cherry Valley in summer , a white house with an orchard that went down to a lake ... Before Jenny died  --  ' He broke off abruptly , but the almost gentle , reminiscent smile lingered on his mouth . ' Jesus , ' he said , ' that 's the way I still mark time , it 's A.D. and B. C. '  |p211The  waitress brought his drink and when she turned away he drank it quickly . He watched the woman stirring her highball , which she had barely touched . Come on , now , ' he said , let 's see you drink it . ' I do n't like to drink right after a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' She flushed and said , I do n't want it . I 'm going . ' She stirred restlessly and began to pull on her gloves . Take it easy , ' he said . No , I 'm going , ' she said , and as she strained at her glove , she knocked a spoon from the table with her elbow . She bent down . Leave that there , ' the man said to her , his voice dead quiet . She came up slowly and glanced at him . Leave it there , ' he said , carefully pronouncing each word , his face rigid . She dropped her eyes . He relaxed a little . ' Wo n't you ever learn ? ' he asked . ' Wo n't you ? ' She was pulling on the second glove . The headwaiter was hovering near their table now , and the man , slumped down again , looked idly at the check and said , Pay it , will you ? ' He dug into his pocket and threw some bills on the table . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars on the table and began to rummage through a coin purse . The man 's eyes fixed themselves on the quarter which she laid on top of the six bills . What 's that ? ' The girl 's tip . ' Listen , do n't be like that . Remember what I told you about tips ? ' The man snorted and reached into his pocket . His hand came out and he tossed a half dollar on the table . That 's just silly , ' she said , looking at the two coins . Can you divide by ten ? ' he asked , and then shook his head back and forth slowly , pityingly , and looking at her , not unkindly now , he said , I always did what was easiest . Now that Frankie 's gone , I see that . That 's the trouble , I guess , you do what 's easiest . '  | ' What are you talking about ? ' You do what 's easiest , I 'm saying . ' Who ? Me ? ' No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' ' Well ?

' ' I 'm not blaming anybody , ' he said . ' It was just my bad luck . And it 's like I say  --  you do what 's easiest , that 's all . ' Meaning me , I suppose , ' she said angrily . Meaning you , ' he said . Come on , there 's a bar a couple of doors up ' No more bars today , thanks , ' she said , struggling into her black coat . Then she leaned forward and for the first time spoke to him with feeling . Listen , ' she said , I 'm sick of bars , and I 'm sick of rooms full of cigar smoke , I 'm sick of whisky and all hours of the night and nothing neat or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to dress and men whose life is just a long going to pieces . I 'm sick of everything . Myself , too . ' She covered her face with her handkerchief and wept into it . When she looked up again she said , ' I 'm not much , I know . I 'm just a plain woman , plain , you hear , and one who likes things to be neat , and I never did want that kind of a life . ' Stop sniveling . ' As he looked at her the lines of his face tightened . God damn , ' he said reflectively . She buttoned her coat . ' Listen , ' she said softly then , ' I 've done more ' ' I know , I know , ' he answered , more than most women would have . Sure . That 's the trouble . Why 'd you do it , when that was n't what you wanted ? I did n't want it either . That was n't why I hired you .

The headwaiterrushed up and took his arm . Go away , ' the man said , pulling free , and went out , one arm in a sleeve of the coat , and the end of it dragging . The woman hesitated before the windows ; the drizzle had turned to hard rain , almost obscuring the traffic as it moved patiently uptown and downtown . When the man appeared , she stared at him and then helped him with his coat . She got his arms into it , straightened out the collar , and buttoned it . The red plume on her hat was sagging from the downpour as she started away from him . He put out his hand and seized her sleeve . They began to argue . She tried to push him away , but when he staggered , she clutched his arm and held him up . And then , helping him along the wet sidewalk , letting him support himself on her arm , they disappeared . Then there was only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glittering curtain of it , the dim shapes of traffic , and presently , other people , bent forward into the rain , walking rapidly by.  | HARRY FOSTER surprised his wife , Alice , by telephoning her one morning at about eleven o'clock . She had been straightening out her little boy 's room and wondering , as she always did when she was in it , if they would ever be able to afford an apartment where he would have a larger and sunnier room . When Alice heard Harry 's voice saying that he had been made a merchandise manager in the store where for five years he had been merely a buyer for a number of unimportant departments , she began to cry . Harry , I 'm crying , ' she said . How wonderful ! How perfectly swell ! Oh , darling , I 'm ' So start packing , ' Harry said . You mean we can move ? ' Sure we can move  --  on fifteen hundred more . ' Wait a minute , ' she said . She found a wad of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes with it and blew her nose . How will we celebrate ? I want to go to the Oval Club . We have n't been in a night club for three years . ' I 'll fix it , ' Harry said . Good-bye , baby . ' That evening , when the Fosters arrived at the Oval Club , they were shown to a table next to the dance floor , which was a platform at the end of the room opposite the entrance . At the back of the platform the orchestra sat under a kind of canopy provided by a structure shaped like an enormous , scalloped shell . Harry ordered drinks , and Alice said , Listen to whatp215they 're playing . ' She reached across the table and squeezed his hand . What is it ? ' ' It 's " Love in Bloom . " Do n't you remember the Barbary Coast Orchestra at Dartmouth ? They played it all that week end of House Parties when we got engaged . You kept singingit . ' Did I ? ' Harry said . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why do n't we ever go back there ? I love Hanover . ' Do you ? ' I love those white buildings . When everything 's green and the sun 's setting . You never feel like going back , do you ? ' No , ' Harry said . The waiter came and put their drinks down . When he went away , Harry looked at Alice and said , It 's a second-rate college . Two good ones turned me down and Dartmouth took me . ' Alice laughed . Is that supposed to be a joke ? ' ' No . ' Well , it 's not true , Harry . Why are you saying it ? ' Of course it 's true . ' You never mentioned it before . ' It 's still true , ' he said . She put out her hand again and took his . What 's the matter ? Are n't you happy ? This is a wonderful day , Harry . I feel wonderful . Just think what it means to us , to Phillip . Why , everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . Come on , be happy . ' Ah , ' he said , and , pulling his lax hand from under hers , finished most of his highball . A few couples had started to dance on the platform , and Alice watched the men 's trouser legs and the trim legs of their girls as they passed before her eyes not more than a foot away , their knees about on a level with the table . She smiled and turned back to Harry . You know what Phillip said today ?  |p116I  was boning what was left of last night 's mackerel to cream for his supper , and when lie saw the backbone , he said , " Oh , Mummie , can I have it for my museum ? " Is n't that cute ? ' Hmmm , ' Harry said , watching the dancers , and then , That Weiner . He is really a stinker . ' Oh , Harry . ' He really is . God , how he hated to have to tell me I was promoted . ' Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had n't lost half their men , I would n't have had a chance . He said , " Foster , you 're very lucky . This kind of position has always been for a first-class person . " The crust of the guy . ' Well , it is lucky --  ' Thanks . That 's what Weiner kept rubbing in . ' I mean ' And I would n't have got it if it had been up to him . For five years I 've had to listen to his belittling remarks and take his lousy sniping . He ca n't stand to see me get out from under . ' Harry , be reasonable . Why should Weiner have a grudge against you ? He just works for the store like you do . He does n't own it . He does n't even run it . ' He runs me . You never saw Weiner . Cracking the whip while I run is Weiner 's chief pleasure . It breaks his heart to let me get ahead this way . For half an hour in his office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and went over most of my records to prove it , and about the time I thought he was going to tell me I was through , he had to break down and tell me I was getting a promotion instead . You do n't know him . You do n't know what I 've had to take from him for five years . His favorite topic  --  first-class men . He 's a firstclassbastard . ' Let 's dance , Harry . ' They stood up and Alice smoothed down the skirt of herp217black dress . They went up the steps onto the platform and Harry put his hand on her back and they started dancing , slowly and soberly , like most of the others on the floor . Then a new couple appeared , a girl in a light-blue dress with a short , full skirt and a young man in a greenish suit . Neither of them was over twenty , and they were both very short , hardly more than five feet , and both had dark complexions and very black eyes and hair . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swinging and turning of the jitterbug . Oh , my God ! ' Harry groaned . How did they get in ? Do we have to put up with that ? ' They 're cute , ' Alice said . How do they do it ? ' They were executing their complicated steps very easily among the other dancers , twisting and turning , moving away from each other and coming together again , all very rapidly , and apparentlywithout looking at anyone but themselves . The girl 's long black hair swung out and around her head the way her skirt swung out and around her legs . Cute ! ' Harry said . Just a moment later the short young man backed into him , and he said loudly , Take it easy ! ' Sorry , ' the young man said automatically , without glancingat Harry , and moved away again . Let 's sit down , ' Harry said . I 'm having fun , ' Alice said . I 'm not . I do n't feel like dancing . ' The Fosters went back to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the short , dark couple weaving in and out among the other dancers for a while and then he said , Would n't you know it ? Out of this whole roomful of people , all of them content to dance quietly up there , the two people to come up with that stuff would be a couple of I'Do n't say it ! ' Alice blurted out . But there it is . Right in front of you . You could n't ask for better evidence . No sense of their surroundings at all , of how other people behave . Just a good chance to show off . Exhibitionists . You could predict it . It would take a couple ofDo n't say it ! ' Harry looked at her with pitying disgust . How do you know what they are ? ' Alice asked . They might be anything . They might be Italians , or Greeks , or Spaniards , or anything . Why , they could be Irish ! Anyway I think they 're very good . They are very clever , Harry . I 'd give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm happy . I love everybody . I love being in this room . I love everyone in it . I love the music , I love you , I love those kids  --  ' Alice in Wonderland , ' Harry said sourly . I love that girl 's legs , too , ' Alice went on . The one with the lace at the bottom of her dress . ' Harry looked up from his glass . The girl was just dancing past their table . She had rather large feet , in plain , black suede pumps with a medium heel , and her legs were nicely shaped , with robust calves and well-defined ankles . The shoes are about 9-B , ' Harry said . But are n't her legs lovely ? ' No , ' Harry said . They 're much too thick . Those are the kind I like . ' He was looking at the legs of the next girl dancing past their table . The feet were short , with a high arch , in very high-heeled black sandals with an ankle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man 's hand could easily encircle and calves just perceptibly developed . Skinny , ' Alice said . That 's the kind I like , and they 're very sexy . ' Harry looked at Alice almost speculatively . She glanced at him and smiled . Well-developed legs are sexy , but not poor , spindly things like that . Here are mine again.  |p219Hulks  , ' Harry said . Then the jitterbugs came by , the girl 's blue dirndl skirt wrapping and unwrapping itself about her knees as she was twirled away from and back to her partner . Harry turned his back toward the platform in disgust . The music ended abruptly with a flourish of drums . Alice and Harry watched the dancers come down from the platform . There 's mine , ' Alice said , looking at the girl with the heavy legs and the lace around the hem of her skirt . There 's mine , ' said Harry . Mine 's wearing stockings . ' Younger girls do n't have to , ' Harry said . Alice bit on her lower lip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The jitterbugs came down last of all , and then Harry and Alice saw that the headwaiter was confronting them and talking rapidly , angrily . The young man began to argue , and then the girl pulled him away . Thank God , ' Harry said . Why ? What happened ? ' He told them they could n't dance that way here . Maybe he told them to get out . ' Alice said , That 's the first time you 've sounded happy tonight . Let 's go . ' She picked up her bag . Go ? We just came . You wanted to see the show here . That 's why you wanted to come . ' I 'm going . What 's wrong with you , Harry ? Why do you have to spoil everything ? Why do you always spoil everything ? ' What are you talking about ? ' Alice stood up . Those people were n't harming you . They were having a good time . So was I. We came here to celebrate . I felt good . Why did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? Or do n't you think I knew you were really talking about my legs ? '  | Listen- " She felt tears coming into her eyes , and she said , Oh , damn you , ' and walked quickly toward the door at the far end of the room.  | TODAY , TODAY , ' Dickie Morris said again , quietly , almostmusingly , and no one in the room looked up at him . His sister Margie sat on the floor , busy with a parade of wooden animals she had removed from a creche under the Christmas tree ; his mother was reading on the sofa ; and his father was still completely hidden by the Sunday newspaper . Today 's the day , ' the boy said , and turned to a window . He looked out at the suburban street , piled high with new snow , brilliant in winter sunshine , and he watched a man in a blue mackinaw pulling a boy on a sled , and a setter leaping beside them over drifts . I-le heard the newspaper rattling behind him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had dropped it . Now ? ' he cried . Dan Morris yawned and stretched out his arms . Sleepy ? ' Kitty Morris asked , looking up . I woke up at four and could n't get back to sleep . ' You were sleeping at seven . ' Yes . Finally . ' What was wrong ? ' ' I do n't know . Nerves . ' ' You  --  nerves ? ' Draft nerves , I suppose . ' Now , Dad ? ' Dickie asked , crowding between his father 's knees . Dan hugged him briefly . Wait just a second . ' He hunted through the rumpled pile of newspaper , pulled out the front section , and walked over to the chintz-covered sofa where Kitty sat reading . Her legs were pulled up under her , and she had not pinned up her hair , which hung loosely and unevenlyabout her neck , and she looked young in her white housecoat . He sat down beside her and pointed to a column of print . I can still be called up any time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly , It 's just the same as it was , is n't it ? Is n't it just the same ? They wo n't actually be needing you yet a while . ' Kit , we 've been all through this , time and again . But  --  well , I ca n't see ahead for you , even now . And of course I want to do my share . If they need me , I 'll go  --  of course . ' He was looking around the pleasant living-room , flooded with morning sunshine , at the garlands of tinsel on the tree and the holly strung in the doorways , and suddenly he reached out and seized Margie , who had left her animals and was standing before him , and held her against his chest . Dickie was watching . What 's going to happen ? ' he asked . Nothing , dear , ' Kitty said . How about that train , Dick ? ' Dan asked abruptly . The children followed him into the small sun parlor off the livingroom . It was empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , everything but the green and yellow flowered draperies . How 're you going to do it ? ' Dickie asked as he stared at the sheets of plywood stacked against the wall . Just nail them down . Let 's see  --  hammer , nails , screwdriver , tacks for the tracks , tack hammer  --  you bring the tracks from under the tree . ' They 're here , they 're all ready , they 've been waiting Trains , too ? Okay . I 'll get the tools . ' He went out . Dickie , ' Kitty called . She patted the place beside her onthe sofa . Sit here , dear . '  |p223You  read to me , Mummie ? ' Margie asked , holding a book she had picked up from under the tree . Six-year-olds , ' Kitty said emphatically to the boy , almost always have the wind-up kind of train , andBut mine 's electric , ' Dickie exclaimed . Yes , but the point is , Dickie , that you really are too young . Only we thought we could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be quite a while . Even the plywood , you see , Dickie , was hard to get . You ca n't just call up and get things any more . ' Why did we need the plywood ? ' The floor is warped , and an electric train needs a smooth floor . You 've been very patientWhat does the war need plywood for ? ' I do n't know . Airplanes to bomb the Nazis . No , it could n't be planes . Gliders , perhaps . But the point is , Dickie , ' she said firmly , we expect you to take care of the train as though you were eight or ten , a big boy . ' Dan came back with the tools . He had put on sneakers and an old gray flannel shirt . Dickie jumped to his feet . The panels of plywood had been cut to the shape of the sun parlor , and in a few minutes Dan had them in place and started to nail them down . Kitty pulled a chair up to the French doors of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The children crowded round their father as he moved about on his knees . Do n't eat those nails , ' Dickie said happily . Dan glanced at him and grinned , the nails between his teeth , and went on pounding . Finally he stood up . There , Dick , that 's done . Now where are the tracks ? ' Margie stood beside her mother . You read to me ? ' she asked , fidgeting on one leg and still holding her book . When her mother did not look up from the newspaper , Margie went back to the tree and pushed the intricately carved sheep and cows into a heap . A.p224How 's that ? ' Dan asked when the tracks had been laid out in a large oval in the center of which he squatted with his son . ' Christmas week bombings terrific , ' Kitty read aloud . She looked up . Can anything be left of those cities , anythingat all ? ' Dan came into the living-room and took a cigarette from a box . ' " Blockbuster ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word ! Oh , Dan , what 'll we do when --  ' Dickie , who had been listening to them , came out with two pieces of track in his hands . Is this the way ? ' He tried to join them . Just a second , Dick . Let me have this cigarette . ' To Kitty he said , When I go Margie looked up from the animals . Where you going , Daddy ? ' ' This is n't the time , I guess , ' Dan said to Kitty . You want to be a soldier , Dad ? ' Dickie asked , looking at him with interest . Who said anything about being a soldier ? ' Would we move ? Could I take the train ? ' Come on , let 's get the tracks together . ' He finished his cigarette and they went back into the sun parlor and Dan began to join the sections of track . I 'll help , ' Dickie said . He tried to fasten two pieces of track and was still struggling with them when Dan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Oh , ' he said , and crawled around the circle to work the other way . At last Dickie got his two pieces together and began to fasten them to the large section which Dan had already finished . He lifted the end of the arc of track off the floor and it suddenly fell apart . Dan looked up , and his jaws tightened . He spoke in a low , exasperated voice . Damn it , Dick , that 's not helping . I do n't intend to work at this thing all day . '  |p225Dickie  dropped the track and looked at the floor . It 's my train , ' he murmured . Dan stood up . Okay , you set it up . ' He started to walk away . Dickie watched him despairingly . Or do you want to let me do it ? ' Dan asked firmly . You do it , ' Dickie said , and slid back against the wall . Then , as something snapped and crackled in the living-room , they turned to look . Margie had stepped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the floor in splinters . Oh , Margie ! ' Kitty wailed , standing over them . Those were mine ! I 've had those ever since I was little ! You just wo n't learn to keep away from my things . ' She swooped down and picked up the child . You sit in the hall until you really want to be in here with us , ' she said . Margie was howling . Kitty plumped her down on the bottom step of the stairwayin the hall and came angrily back into the living-room . She picked up the fragments of painted wood and looked at them in her hands . How maddening ! My grandmother brought these things to me from Switzerland when I was a little girl . Really --  " Dan was grinning a little . Things , ' he said . ' Do things matter ? ' And the smile left his face as once more he looked lingeringly at the living-room , and his eyes fastened on the wax flowers under a Victorian glass dome on the mantel . I guess they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wastebasket . No , ' she said , they do n't , of course . ' In the hall , Margie was sobbing , and Dickie was looking at his mother accusingly . She did n't mean to do it . ' Kitty stared at him and suddenly she said , Of course she did n't . Things ! Dickie , I 'm ashamed of myself . Losing my temper over a few broken sheep . Oh , I am ashamed ! Margie , come back , ' she called , and sat down again . Margie , sniffling , walked stiffly past her mother and on into the sun parlor where Dan was fastening the track to the plywood with carpet tacks . Dickie had emptied all the cartons which had been stacked in a corner , and put their contents in the center of the oval  --  the transformer , the tunnel , the trains  --  engine , coal car , tanker , gondola car and caboose . They looked bright and new in the sunlight . This piece is n't very definite , Dan . I still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' said Kitty . Why do n't you face it , Kit ? And forget it . ' The newspaper rattled into her lap and her face suddenly seemed much older . But Dan  --  I do n't mean I want to keep you here  --  if they need you . I 'm sure I could find some work somewhere , and the children --  ' I want you to look at this engine , ' Dan said abruptly to Dickie . I did  --  lots , ' he said absently , but he was staring at his mother , and he asked , What did you say ? ' Look at it closely , ' Dan said , tugging at his sleeve . He picked up the engine . It was solid and heavy , beautifully designed , a perfect model . Look in there , Dick . Delicate as a watch . You 've got to handle it carefully . ' I know it . ' Well , let 's connect the transformer . ' He pulled a jackknifeand a coil of fine wire from his pocket , cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the ends , connected the two bare ends with the plate fastened under the tracks and the two other ends with the transformer . Now we line up the trains . ' He put all the cars on the track and joined the fine couplings . Now you have to be sure that all the wheels are on the track , and especially these . ' The children and their father were all on their knees , staringunder the engine . Now look at this , ' Dan said , pointing to a small lever on the top of the engine . When it 's in the middle , it 's in neutral . This side is reverse . This side is forward . Always have it in the middle when you plug in the transformer . Then move it to forward . See ? '  |p227Dickie  nodded breathlessly . Plug in the transformer , ' Dan said , pointing to an electric outlet in the baseboard . Suddenly the little headlight on the engine flashed on and the motor began to hum . There she is , ' Dan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excitement . Okay ! ' Dan pushed the lever . The train began to move , then quickly picked up speed , and when it reached the first curve in the oval track , rushed off , dashed against the wall and toppled on its side , its wheels spinning and the motor buzzing loudly . Too much speed , ' Dan said . He adjusted the switch on the transformer , picked up the cars , put them back on the tracks , connected those that had become uncoupled in the spill , and said , All right , here we go . ' Once more he moved the lever . Just then Margie screamed , The tunnel ! ' She grabbed the forgotten tunnel and put it over the track , but before she could straighten it , the train had bumped into it and once more crashed off the tracks , all the cars on their sides again , the wheels spinning . God damn it , ' Dan said . All right , Margie . You get off there to the side and stay put . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me , ' Kitty called , but Margie backed against the windows of the sun parlor and stood there . Once more Dan put the train in order , and this time it stayed on the track until it came to the curve . Once more it dashed across the floor , against the wall , and spilled . Still too fast , ' Dan said . He adjusted the transformer and went through the whole business again . This time the train barely crept along the track , but it went around the entire oval , and then for the second time passed safely over the treacherous curve . Dan touched the transformer , and the train picked up a little speed . Margie came closer , and both children jigged with excitement , and when the engine came to the curve , it crashed once more . God damn it ! ' Dan cried , loudly this time . He bent down closely over the crucial curve and examined the tracks . Nothing wrong here , ' he said . They 're tight as anything . ' Dan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it again . Now both of you keep quiet . Do n't hop up and down . ' Dickie and Margie stood side by side against the wall and watched Dan put the cars together again and push the lever . Slowly the train started forward and picked up speed . As it came toward them , both children held their breath , clenched their fists tightly , and then , as it passed them , began to jig . The train dashed off the tracks at the curve . Dan was kneeling tensely in the center of the oval . His face was bright red . He seized the engine in his hand and began to shout at the children . God damn it , ca n't you do as you 're told ? I told you not to hop ! You shake it off ! Do you want this damned train or do n't you ? I 'll smashDan ! ' Kitty cried . He looked up at her . Then he looked at the children . Margie 's lips were trembling and tears were in her eyes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father 's , staring at him . ' Dan , ' Kitty said . He put the train down , pulled the plug of the transformer , and walked out . Kitty followed him into the dining-room . Dan , ' she said , it was n't the children . I tried to tell you . From where I sat , I suddenly saw that the plywood right there slopes , just the way the floor under it does . We 'd better get a carpenter . ' Dan 's face was white now , and his hands were trembling as he clutched the neck of a decanter and poured whisky into a tall glass . He drank it quickly . P229You must n't lose your temper that way , especially over objects . It really was the engine you were outraged about , not the children . You really must n't , Dan . Oh , darling .. He looked away from her at the leaves of the laurel wreath in the center of the mahogany dining-table . Holidays ! It was n't even the engine , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that pounding ? ' Then Margie was crying out to them from the door of the dining-room . Dickie 's  --  Dickie 's  --  Dickie is ' She could not finish what she was trying to say , but her parents did not wait . They rushed past her , through the living-room , to the doors of the sun parlor . They saw Dickie kneeling on the floor , Dan 's heavy hammer in his hands , slamming it over and over with methodical fury on what was left of the engine , and shouting , I 'm a Nazi bomber ! I 'm a Nazi bomber ! ' Dan , leaning weakly against the door frame , watched him without saying anything . But Kitty was crying . Dickie looked up . His face was red , and he was biting his lip . He lifted the hammer again and struck it with a bang against the wreckage . Defiantly , he lifted it once more , but this time he brought it down less heavily . Then , still looking at his parents , he began to cry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hammer fell from his hands . The tears streamed down his flushed face , and he sobbed again , I 'm ashamed ! I 'm ashamed ! ' Dan dropped to his knees and seized the boy 's hands . No , do n't be , Dickie , do n't be , please , ' he whispered urgently . I 'm the one , Dickie , I 'm the one . ' And I , ' Kitty cried , and I ! '   ALBERT SAMPSON was waiting for a student late one summer afternoon in his office in Morris House , the white clapboard building which sheltered the RomanceLanguage Department of the New England college in which he taught . He had , for the moment , forgotten the heat outside . His office was on the north side of the building , and in the afternoon a row of old elm trees just outside the windows kept it dark and relatively cool ; also , he had come across the yearbook of his class , 1930 , while straightening his shelves , and now , sitting behind his desk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open window , he was looking at his photograph in the book . He could not see any great difference between his face then and the way he looked now ; the face in the photograph was more eager , of course , more open , yet not really different . His hair , perhaps , was thinner now , receding at the temples , but he still wore a crew cut . The eyes looked at him from the picture with the same easy candor with which , he supposed , he still looked out at the world . But when he glanced at the print under the photograph , his gray-green eyes narrowed , and the lines on either side of his mouth , wrinkles formed by a characteristic smile , deepened into fretfulness . Most Popular Man . . . . Destiny : brilliant critic or novelist . ' Thirteen years . And he was now an instructor in French at thirty-one hundred a year , without prospects of promotion or f a raise in salary . P231The ringing of the telephone on his desk was so startling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legs of his chair came down on the floor with a bang . It was Sally , his wife . Albert , ' she said , there 's a letter for you from the Army Air Forces . Shall I open it and read it to you ? ' His breath stopped in his throat . He hesitated . Then he said , No , I 'll come right home , ' and started to put the instrumentdown . Oh , Albert ' ' Yes ? ' Bring a loaf of whole-wheat bread on yours way , and a small melon . ' Yes , ' he said . And stop at Larkin 's to see if they 've repaired the electric fan . The heat has had the baby howling all afternoon . ' Yes , ' he said again . He got up quickly , pulled on the seersucker jacket which hung on the back of a chair , and rushed into the corridor and out of the building . Outside , on the steps , the heavy , damp heat of the August afternoon struck him with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up at the pallid sky ; its vast insipidity promised no relief . Sweat broke out all over his body . He pulled a damp , wrinkled handkerchief from the hip pocket of his gray flannnel trousers and wiped it across his eyes . When he looked up he saw Richard Crane running toward him along the path that led to the steps where he had paused . Sorry I 'm late , sir , ' Crane said , panting . He was sweating , too , and , like Albert , mopping his face . I wanted to say good-bye . ' Where are you going ? ' Fort Devens , sir . Tomorrow . ' You 've been drafted ? But I thought you were 4F ' I was reclassified last month . ' P232Oh . Well , look , walk along with me . ' They went down the path between neatly boxed hedges toward the main quadrangle of the campus . When it 's over , ' Crane said , I want to come back and do some more work with you on Racine , if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speculatively , and then , Crane , I do n't care , you know , if I never hear of Racine again . ' The boy looked at him with solemn surprise . Why --  ' he said , but Albert interrupted him . You see , Crane , I 'm going in too . ' Into the Army ? ' I 've applied for a commission . Army Air Corps . ' Albert 's voice was elated . They need instructors . Of course , I may not get it  --  everyone is n't getting a commission now , the way it was a while back  --  but even so , in my interview the officer said my chances were good . I 'll be teaching straight technical subjects . If I teach , that is . ' But if the commission is for teaching --  ' Oh , that . I 've been told it does n't matter much . If they like your looks , they put you in action . I know men from the last war who went in this way and then found themselves at the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And you can see , too , ca n't you , Crane , what it makes of Racine ? And of all this ? ' Albert swept his arm out in a semicircle . They were now in the quadrangle , nearly deserted in the hot , late afternoon . The Georgian buildings , standing tidily on the brilliant grass , among the well-kept , symmetrical trees , looked like enormous dolls ' houses . All dead , Crane . Pretty and dead . ' What about your book on the Symbolists ? ' I 've lost interest . That 's why I have n't any future here . They think I 'm lazy . They think I have n't lived up to my promise . But with this ahead of me , I can tell you what I think , and it 's to hell with them . ' P233The boy 's eyes , behind his spectacles , were puzzled and hurt . As he and Albert emerged from the quadrangle , he said , Here 's where I turn . ' I 'm afraid I talked mostly about myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhere . And do n't worry , Racine will keep . ' They shook hands , and Crane , as if he suddenly felt shy , ducked his head and swung off in the direction of his dormitory . Albert began to whistle and walked rapidly away toward his home . The Sampsons lived on the second floor of an old house which had been converted into flats . It was painted an intenselyugly color , a nearly mustard yellow , and whenever Albert approached the building , he found himself doing so with repugnance . But today he did not notice . He watched the newsboy swing close to the curb on his bicycle , throw the evening paper up on the steps , and then wheel out into the street again . As Albert came closer , he saw Claudia , his sixyear-olddaughter , playing aimlessly on the steps with some bits of gravel she had picked up from the drive . One cheek had a gray smudge on it and wisps of her brown hair had escaped from her pigtails , which were neat and tight in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands were grimy . He bent down and kissed her and , more cheerfully than usual , said , Hello , darling . ' Ic picked up the newspaper and ran up the steps . Claudia followed him in . Albert saw the letter at once on the cluttered telephone table in the hall , a long white envelope which seemed faintly luminous in the gloom of the dark corridor . I le picked it up and walked into the living room . The baby , whimpering and nearly naked , was in his play pen in the middle of the room and Sally was working at her desk . Hello , darling , ' Albert said . What did the letter say ? ' Sally asked eagerly . P234I have n't read it yet , ' he answered . He dropped the newspaper in a chair and kept on walking . Claudia came in after him , holding a doll . Daddy , fix my doll 's ' she began , but Albert was already in the back hall . He went into the bedroom and closed the door behind him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the door , the letter in one hand . Then he walked over to his bureau , which stood between two windows . He looked at his name on the envelope and he saw how the envelope was shaking . He looked away from it and his glance fell on the unused gifts on his bureau top . Sally and he had agreed , before his birthdaya few weeks ago , that he had better be given things which he would need when he got in . ' The pigskin toilet case was from Sally , the writing kit of durable imitation leather was from Claudia , the black wallet , small enough to fit in a hip pocket and equipped with transparent flaps for all the identificationcards one needed to carry , was from the friends who had been asked to his birthday dinner , and the cellophane money belt , which had cost a dollar and nineteen cents , was , Claudia had insisted , from the baby . Albert looked at these things and abruptly tore off one end of the envelope . A glance was enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered . . . so many applicants with a high degree of technical training . . . can not now consider . . . ' He crumpled the letter in his fist , put his arms on the bureau , and laid his head down on them . When he straightened up , he looked at the gifts again , and presently he opened the top drawer of the bureau , where he kept his neckties and handkerchiefs , and pushed the toilet case , the writing kit , the wallet , and the money belt into it . The crumpled letter he stuffed into his pocket . He walked to the door and stared at it , and at last he went back to the living room . The baby was crying ; Sally looked up from the papers on her desk . Did you getP235the fan ? Bobby 's miserable and I 've been too busy all day to take him out . ' I forgot , ' he said dully , and I forgot the groceries , too . ' Oh , Albert ! ' Daddy , look , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hands and held out its wig to him , a matted , carrotcoloredcap of imitation hair . Albert glanced at the curious bald head of the doll . Well , ' Sally said , one of us will have to go for them . We have n't any bread and we have n't any dessert . But first I want you to look at these . ' What ? ' Albert asked , and turning to Claudia , he said , Put Bobby 's toys back in his play pen and keep him quiet . ' These billsOh , Lord . ' He dropped the doll into a chair , picked up the newspaper , and glanced at the weather report . ' Continuedhumid . " Christ , I 'll go crazy , ' he said . He took off his coat and opened the collar of his shirt . Is n't there anythingwe can do about this apartment ? It 's as damp as a cel-lar . ' Albert , ' Sally said , this is the last liquor bill we can pay . We 'll have to cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everything 's become so expensive , and all the talk about easy money and high wages just does n't fit us . Your salary is just what it was three years ago , but pricesSally , do n't , ' he said . He was looking at her dress , of blue cotton with a mild little pink flower printed all over it . Then he looked at her bare feet under the desk , and her shoes , lying where she had kicked them off . And finally , he looked at her face , white and tired , without makeup , drawn . I mean it , Albert . And that is n't all . I 've got to let the cleaning woman go , and I 've got to do more of the laundry myself  --  all but your shirts . We just ca n't run bills like these any more . I 'm at the point where I juggle one against the other , figure out which one can slide or which one I canP236pay just part of , and it gets worse every month . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , Daddy ? ' Claudia asked . She had put the toys back in the pen , and for the moment , while the baby threw them out again , he was quiet . Albert saw that his diaper was wet . Thanks , ' he said to Claudia . And now will you fix my doll ? ' asked Claudia . There 's some glue in your desk . ' Did you hear what I said , Albert ? ' Sally asked , looking at his face , which seemed listless and dull . No , ' he said . She stood up angrily , and he noticed how small she was without shoes . You have a streak of absolute infantilism , you know . Darling , we ca n't pretend we have more money than we 've got . We ca n't drink liquor we ca n't buy or hire a cleaning woman we ca n't pay . You just wo n't face anything . But I ca n't live on fantasy . I 've even thought this afternoon of putting the children in one room and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for God 's sakeOh , ' she said , surprised , what did the letter say ? ' His face became suddenly alive again . I was turned down , ' he said , and then , in a rising voice , he cried , But do n't worry , they 'll get me yet . I 'll be drafted ! This war is n't over by a long shot ! Do n't you worry ! ' She drew in her breath sharply and backed away a step as she saw his eyes , narrowed , and burning at her with a kind of wildness .   I LIKE AN AIR OF SUCCESS , ' said Roger Shaw into the darkness . It was eight o'clock on a warm evening in early October , and , except that black night had already shut down utterly and that a persistent wind moaned through the trees  --  it would have seemed like summer still . That dining room is always empty , ' Roger went on as he led the way up the path to the cottage . It 's depressing . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Wentworths , picking their way along behind Lucia Shaw , said nothing , and Lucia made another of those sniffling sounds which they had all heard ever since they left the inn where , as a farewell gesture , the Wentworths had taken the Shaws to dine . How have they kept that place going all summer ? ' Roger demanded almost angrily . They were walking along the side of the house toward the back porch , where a light was burning , and when Lucia blew her nose firmly , Roger said quickly , In an empty dining room like that , you have to whisper , or the waitresses hear everything you say . ' They would n't have been fascinated by our conversation , ' Lucia said quietly and rather thickly . We should apologize to the Wentworths . Our domestic problems are pretty dull . ' She turned her face away from the others as they came into the light , as though she were engrossed in the curious shadows of waving branches on the ground in the open space behind the cottage . P238What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had asked the question twice at dinner , said again . God knows ! ' Roger answered , desperately , at last , and almost violently pulled open the screen door . He held it for the others . The light fell on a chair placed just inside the porch door . What 's this ? ' asked Lucia . On the chair was an empty milk bottle , and in the bottle , a piece of white paper . Lucia took the paper , pushed the chair aside , and led the way in . She looked at the note . It had been written by Judy , her eightyear-olddaughter , who had been left alone with Peter , the two-year-old . Lucia read it aloud . " Mummie , call Washington . Operator 46 . They called twice . " ' Washington ? ' Roger asked . Washington , ' Lucia said , puzzled . I have n't been there for nine years . Who could it be ? ' Aline looked at the paper . What a wonderful child Judy is ! ' she said . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Independence is a virtue which the poor develop early , ' Roger said with a sour smile . Oh , listen ! ' Perry protested , frowning . The four of them walked through the kitchen into the livingroom of the cottage . Aline Wentworth went straight to a wicker sofa . She was wearing a large black hat which dipped down over her face , hiding her eyes unless she raised her head high , and a dress with narrow black and white stripes , and short white gloves . She took some children 's things off the sofa  --  a soiled yellow rabbit , some sort of cart , a pink sweater and a pair of damp training pants , and a few blocks  --  stopped to unfasten the straps of her high-heeled sandals , stretched out full length , and then pulled off her gloves and kicked off her shoes . She did not remove her hat . The shoes lay on the floor among the toys . Lucia walked to the stairs where the telephone was . SheP239stood there hesitating , her hand on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Go ahead , ' Roger said . But I do n't know anybody in Washington . It 's nine years since I worked there . Who could it be ? ' There 's only one way to find out , ' Roger said impatiently . He picked up the telephone . This is Stamford 6-2003 , ' he said . You have a Washington call for Mrs. Roger Shaw . Operator 46 . ' He handed the telephone to Lucia . She sat down slowly on the lowest step on the stairway and put the instrument on her knees . In her ankle socks and moccasins and her simple gingham dress , her figure looked like a young girl 's , but her plain , vaguely pretty face was tired and drab . The men stood in front of the empty fireplace , looking at Lucia and then at one another and saying nothing . All lines to Washington are busy . They 'll call me , ' Lucia said , dropping wearily into a wicker chair with faded cretonne pillows . The men sat down . Lucia found her knitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and her lips moved rapidly , silently , as she worked her needles . For a few minutesno one said anything , and the tapping of a branch against a window pane was the only sound . It was the end of the week-end ; and the Wentworths , who were going back to New Haven in the morning , should have gone twelve hours earlier , when heavy silences such as that now settling on the room had not occurred . Perry stirred uneasily in his chair . What do you think you will do ? ' he asked Roger once more . What can we do ? I guess we 're going on with Wentworth charity . ' There 's no charity . Do n't say that . This cottage is yours for as long as you want it . It 's no good to us . We have n't even used it in the summer for six years , let alone at this time of year . But it does n't solve anything for you . With no heating system , you 'll be freezing before long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If only we did n't have to decide so soon , ' Lucia said complainingly . If only we had a few more months ' grace , somethingmight happen . Fate , or something ! ' But like what ? ' asked Aline from under her hat . Well , sometime Roger 's pictures will start to sell . He has four or five in New York now . Any day someone might buy one . And once we get started .. Her voice trailed off and no one encouraged her to go on . The branch tapped suggestively at the window . Presently Aline sat up . Lucia , let me take Judy back , as I 've asked you . Just until you decide what you are going to do . She 's missed several weeks of school already , and she 'll miss more before you leave here , wo n't she ? Honestly , I 'd love having her . She can have the guest room absolutely to herself , and I 'll take wonderful care of her . You know I adore her . ' Aline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked . You have n't the remotest notion , Aline , of the trouble a child is , or how Judy would mess up that lovely place of yours , with everything so perfect . It 's kind of you It 's not kind at all . It 's selfish . Really , I 'd love to have a child in our house . ' Lucia looked dubiously at Roger . Well , perhaps we 'll have to , for a few weeksPerry spoke firmly . Roger , I 'm going around tomorrow and see if you ca n't get something in the University again . ' No , ' Roger said hopelessly . That 's out . When I left for the Navy , they told me my appointment was over . Now I 'm out of the Navy , but also a job . Anyway , years ago I swore that when the job was over , I was going to stop teaching the stuff and start doing it instead . ' If only ' Lucia began , dropping her knitting into her lap . We should be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Aline asked . With children , it 's frightening to cut loose this way . I 'm a simple homebody and I like things settled . ' She spoke rapidly and nervously , as if talking relieved her . There are jobs , of course . I 've tried to persuade Roger to go to Hartfordor Bridgeport and see what he could get  --  in his line , of course . Industrial designing , or something . But naturally he hates to until we 're really strapped . Roger , who could that call be from ? Washington ! I ca n't imagine . It makes me nervous . ' Aline took off her hat and shook out her loose black hair . We forgot to tell you , ' she said to the men , that Lucia and I picked up two soldiers on the beach this afternoon . ' You did , ' Lucia said . No strange man has looked at me for years . ' Aline said , We were the only people down there , and these boys came along and asked if we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down anyway . ' Lucia went on , I tried to discourage them . I told them we were talking about husbands and children and houses . But they sat right down , one on either side of Aline , and watched her painting her glamorous toenails . They did n't say anything to me . ' She glanced nervously over her shoulder at the telephone . Aline , in her bare feet , walked to a table where there were cigarettes . She lit one and came back to the sofa . ' Husbands , ' she said . You know , Perry is funny . He does n't like the word . When I say , " I 'll ask my husband , " or " This is my husband , " he gets annoyed . He wants me to say Mr. Wentworth to people we do n't know well enough to say " Perry " to . ' The Shaws looked at Perry . Husband , ' Perry said . I do n't like the sound of it . ' Aline raised herself on her elbow . He objects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be catalogued as Husband Wentworth . I do n't blame him . ' And you , ' Roger said rather harshly , you are not his wife , but his mistress . Is n't it all out of a novel of the twenties ? ' Lucia tittered , and Perry changed the subject . Were the soldiers interesting ? Did they have anything to say ? About politics , or anything ? ' Lucia , who had been worriedly staring at Roger , broke in . Do you know the Huebers ? Talk about husband ! Fanny Hueber never uses Jack 's name at all . She always says , " Husband likes this , " and " Husband wants me to do that . " And giggles . It 's ridiculous . Like old Irish women , always saying " Mister " instead of Tim or Dan . Or like Mein Herr , only coy . ' Aline said , Christ ! ' Roger was looking broodingly at his feet , and Lucia , watching him still , said suddenly , I 'm like Fanny , ' and went quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She sat on the arm of the chair and smoothed his thin , reddish hair . Cheer up , ' she said to him . You 're nothing like her ! ' Aline said . Women like Fanny Hueber make me want to say something coarse . ' You know her ? I never saw her at your house . But then , she would n't have been there . You always have such smart parties . ' Nonsense , ' said Aline . Of course , you do . Everything in your life is perfect , and you have everything . Your parties are as smart as you are , and as your house is . With all that glass , and the Aalto designs , and everything . ' Lucia was looking at her with frank admiration . But as she continued to look at Aline , her lips tightened , and her expression changed . It pays , does n't it , if you can afford it , in a college , ' she said , with deliberate pauses , to entertain well , and to have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's mean , Lucia , ' she said , P243and if you really think that I 've had anything to do with Perry 's success , it 's also foolish . ' Oh , I did n't , dear ! ' Lucia protested , and she was looking at Aline admiringly again . Oh , I did n't mean that . ' Aline threw her cigarette into the fireplace , and with a slight twitch about her mouth , she looked around the shabby cottage room , with its washed-out cretonne , its sagging wicker furniture , its cracked and faded wallpaper , and all the evidence of children . As a matter of fact , I 'm tired of our apartment , ' she said . It 's too hard and bright . The next time we move , I 'm going to have a bed with an organdy canopy . All that glass , as you say . I 'm tired of it . ' She stood up and walked to the mirror over the mantel , where she applied a smooth layer of lipstick to her mouth as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands . She had just finished when the telephone rang , and she turned to watch Lucia walk over to it . Lucia 's face was apprehensive as she picked up the telephone , but then suddenly she smiled , and the next moment she cried , Why , Evelyn Masters , what in the world ! ' Aline lay down on the sofa again , crossing her long legs and gazing down at her crimson toenails . Lucia was saying , All right , Evelyn . I 'm listening . ' Roger and the Wentworths could hear the woman 's rapid , distant voice . Lucia was nodding , and at last she said , Of course I 'm interested , Evelyn . When would it start ? ' She paused , and then she said , Oh , dear . But I 'm probably no good any more , it 's been years ! ' Roger Shaw looked interested . He walked over to Lucia and sat beside her on the step . How much ? ' he said . Ask her how much . ' How much , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put the telephone against her flat chest and said , Four thousand and overtime . About forty-four hundred , we could figure . ' And then she said into the telephone , Can I call you back to- morrow , Evelyn ? We 've got to talk this over . Okay ? Good . And thanks a million . ' She put the telephone down and stood up . Well ! ' Tell all , ' said Perry . Roger was hovering eagerly beside her . What is it , Lucia , what is it ? ' It was Evelyn Masters . She was my boss in the Departmentof Agriculture before Roger and I were married . Nine years ago . Now she 's organizing some new office . She heard through someone that we were on the loose . A writing job is open , and she wants me for it . She said she 's never found anybody she could work with as well as me . I have n't even seen her for five years . Forty-four hundred . ' She sat down . How lovely , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't that solve everything ? ' Lucia was looking at Roger . What do you think ? ' What do I think ? ' I was just thinking of the hours . They 're hard . Eightthirtyto five in the office , every day . It means practically never seeing the children , having no sort of home , really . We 'd probably have to live way out somewhere , and what with transportation , it would be seven to seven , or worse , for me . But the children could go to good schools , Judy to the Friends ' School , and Peter to a good government nursery school . But I do n't know . What an awful life ! ' But ' said Roger . What ? ' And when he did not answer , she said , Oh , yes ! The advantages ! I know . The money , and the leisure for you , and nothing to worry about , and you could paint in peace . Oh , yes ! ' I do n't want to push you into itI 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine years , and now I 'm going to do it for a while . We can have a parttimenurse . ' She took a deep breath and straightened outP245her shoulders . I 'll feel that I 'm doing something important , even if it is slavery . You know , it makes me feel wonderful  --  that Evelyn should pick me out . Out of all the people she must have had under her in the last ten years . It 's something , knowing that you can still get a good job , that you 're actually sought out  --  and for a useful , civic thing . ' She looked at Aline 's inert and handsome form . It 's that " something " we 've been waiting for , ' Roger said , very gently , persuasively . It 's fate , taking over for us . ' The wind suddenly whistled around a corner of the cottage , and he added , Winter can come now . ' Aline twisted her shoulders and looked at them . But now I do n't get Judy , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned around . I could take the job , and there 'd 1 ) e no household to worry about . ' Lucia was staring thoughtfully at Aline 's shoes where they lay among the toys on the floor , and suddenly she picked one of them up by its strap and held it dangling in front of her , as if it were some sort of small dead animal . Those barbaric heels ! ' she exclaimed derisively . Look , Roger ! ' The shoe had a thick platform sole and a square , patent leather heel at least five inches tall . There was nothing more to it than a network of patent leather thongs at the toe and an ankle strap . Look , Roger , ' Lucia said again , with curious elation , and the two of them , standing close together , watched the shoe dangle at the end of its strap as Lucia held it gingerly before her . Barbaric , but pretty , ' said Perry . Pretty ? ' Lucia echoed . Well , they 're not for an Indian maiden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not that kind of pretty , ' Perry said . They ruin your posture , ' Roger said . What 's the fuss ? ' asked Aline . They 're old shoes . ' Roger said humorously , They also destroy your Achilles '   tendon , and they do dreadful things to your female organs . ' What is this ? ' Aline said dully . Suddenly Lucia was looking very bright , and with her small mouth drawn into a smile of fixed sweetness , hesitated , but then said what was on her mind : You forget Aline 's operation , or did n't you know ? ' Aline turned her face away and Perry said quickly , High heels do something for a woman 's foot . They raise the arch . Like ballet slippers . The arch is a famous point of beauty . ' Lucia seemed not to be listening . She had one arm around Roger 's waist , and was leaning against him , and she was saying thoughtfully , You know , Perry , those soldiers were stupid . You were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were really stupid , dull . They did n't say one thing that indicated any kind of interest in the world around them . Or did they , Aline ? ' And Roger , for the first time that night , looked contented . He put his arm around Lucia 's waist , as hers was around his , and he said good-naturedly , Oh , well , the army , you know , takes in practically anybody , ' and he laughed happily . Lucia dropped the shoe clatteringly to the floor , and turning to him , so that they were very nearly embracing , she said as happily as he , Husband is cute . ' The branch tapped slyly at the window , and Aline , lying flat on the couch , turned her white face to Perry as if for help , looked at him with eyes which might have been begging that he save her from drowning .   THE HIGH HILL on which the house was situated still blazed with sunlight , the green lawn as brilliant as if it were dyed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but in the valleys all around evening was gathering in black pools and the tall pines were indigo . Here on the hill all objects had a last lovely separateness and clarity  --  flowers , leaves , flagstones , each rock in the wall , a robin that chirped aimlessly on a slender branch ; but below them everything was merging , outlines fading , all separateness being obliterated by the chilly encroachment of Vermont night . Slowly the hill and then the house would be engulfed . It was the most difficult part of the day for Julia Milton , and now she felt her helplessness as if it were a physical attribute , felt it in the way she felt her size , her smallness , her neat little body . Her son was watching her . He repeated his question finally . Where is he now ? Do we know ? ' She picked up the magazine he had spread out on the porch step where he was sitting and glanced at the advertisementwhich had brought the question to his mind . It showed a medical officer giving plasma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees , smashed like broken spears , jagged against a blasted sky . Julia closed the magazine and tossed it up on the narrow porch . The Pacific is the biggest sea , ' she said with inappropriate brightness , and her incompetencedismayed her ; but she went on . It has so manyp248islands . I know a city that 's an island . Hongkong . It 's like the top of a mountain , jutting out of the sea . ' She could not keep his interest . As she spoke , she saw his glance slide away from her face , first to her thumb , because he hated pain and was unable to resist reminders of it , to the clumsy bandage over the burn which she had awkwardly given herself on the range , then down to his sneakers , and at last across the lawn to the old barn , smoky gray and rubbed with pink by the late afternoon light . She could see , in the sudden kindling of his eyes , his desire to be there in the barn , some plan suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to her ! All the fighting is , of course , on islands . ' He looked at her at once , sharply . Japan is a group of islands . The Philippines are islands . Manila ... ' Before she got farther , Tom and , now , Kate , too , were looking away from her , staring down at the ground at the foot of the steps . Somewhat dreamily they were watching two large black ants lugging a third dead one across the stone path . She sighed , and her voice rose with feeling as she said , Manila is a lovely city . It is the whitest city in the world . After your father and I were married , we went around the world , and we lived in Manila for two weeks . ' Both children looked at her again , but she thought it was not because of what she had said but because her voice had become a little shrill . Should she tell them now of storms that came off the Pacific , bending and twisting tropical trees like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses in strong sunlight , white as if they were built of chalk ? Should she tell them of the bazaars of Kowloon , of coral atolls in a turquoise sea , of the sea-cliffs of Formosa , or of eastern gardens kept as carefully as ladies ' elaborate hair ? What could she say in the late Vermont afternoon , where loneliness was something that she breathed with air , where the quiet was more quiet because of the last twitterings of a bird and the insistentp249whirr of a mower working in a distant field  --  what could she say here of the Pacific that would not make her voice go up and that they would care to hear ? The robin had flown to the grass , and suddenly Kate leaped up and ran toward it with a shout . She watched it fly to the wall along the road , and when she came back toward the steps , she began to sing . She had the thin , piping voice of a five-year-old , and the song was one she had learned at play-school in the spring , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It began : I have a bonnet trimmed with blue . Do you wear it ? Yes , I do . I will wear it when I can  --  ' But Tom broke in . He said , as if by prearrangement , We 're going to the hideout , ' and they immediately started off together . No , ' Julia cried , and half arose . You 've just been cleaned up . Do n't go ! ' But they did not turn round , and in the dimming , illusory light they suddenly seemed very far away from her , small and remote on the wide lawn , a white shirt and a pink dress , bright objects far beyond her reach or the power of her voice , and she let them go . Do n't get dirty , ' she called without conviction . And when they had vanished in the barn , she sank down on the step and felt a sharp bitterness toward them . Children , she said to herself , have an infinite capacity for detachment . They are like cats , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is sentimentality . Their voices rose suddenly from the barn  --  a high shriek from Kate and then the awful sound of Tom 's imitation of machine-gune fire : aa  --  aa  --  aa  --  aa  --  aa  --  aa . Their endless , aimless , valueless war games ! If Dick were here , he would have organized some activity for them , been in it himself or interested them in it so intensely that he would not have had to be . But Julia lacked some necessary knack with them . Each day she tortured her brain for something constructive to occupy them for more than a moment , and everything she thought of failed . Their gardens were a tangle of weeds ; in the shed off the kitchen hung the pieces of plyboard she had given them for butterfly and insect collections , and on Kate 's there was a single maimed cricket , on Tom 's , one dragon fly and the wing of a crow ; their scrapbookswere a mess of dried paste and a few pictures put in crookedly ; Dick 's workbench in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was piled with jumbled tools and scraps of wood , and nothing but one misshapen thing that he called an airplane had come of that . What was it  --  about them , about her ? She glanced down into the deep , dark valleys , and she gasped a little . If she could only manage this time of day without falling into her mood of nervous resentment against nothing , and hopelessness ! She called the children in the middle of the afternoon and got them cleaned up early , so that they could all be together at this time ; but like today , she was unable to hold them , and they almost always left her again . On rainy days it was better . They had to stay indoors , she lit a fire , they listened to her while she read , and it was cheery . But to wish for rain at Faraway  --  Dick would slap her if he knew . Still  --  on sunny days they disappeared . She would see them wandering off through a field , and then , much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be in the barn for hours at a time , either making their terrible mock-battle racket , or being absolutely quiet . Sometimes she came upon them suddenly and found them whispering together , and she could not repressthe suspicion , admittedly foolish , that they were almostconspiratorial . Once , when she asked them what they were whispering about , Tom looked at her shrewdly and , in an elaborately offhand way , said , Oh , we got a secret weapon.  |p251Kate  was singing again , behind the barn , and the sound of her small voice made Julia shiver . I will wear it when I can , Going to the ball with my young man .... ' Some secret quality in Kate 's voice disturbed Julia , the remoteness , or perhaps only her self-contained air when she sang , as if she felt that there was no one else in the world , that her song was a miracle by which she transcended all wants . Mrs. Jacobs , the farmer 's wife , for whom Julia had been waiting , was coming up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue dress appear and disappear between the trees , and she stood up to greet her when she got to the gate . The eggs , ' Mrs. Jacobs said , and the fowl . ' She handed Julia the paper box of eggs and the dressed chicken wrapped in newspaper which had become sodden . Sit down for a minute , wo n't you ? ' Julia was glad to see her and her voice was warm with welcome . Mrs. Jacobs was a spare woman of fifty or sixty , with long , taut tendons showing in her brown neck , and thin brown hair pulled tight over her skull . She looked tired and sat down on the steps with a sigh . She took off her gold-rimmed spectaclesand rubbed the steam off them with the edge of her skirt . What do you hear from the Doctor ? ' she asked . I have n't heard anything for more than a month , ' Julia said . It 's not the same up here without him , I guess , ' Mrs. Jacobs said . Julia did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think it was a mistake to come at all this summer . Everything 's so difficult  --  the marketing . . . And the children and I get lonely ! '  | Mrs. Jacobs put her glasses on and looked at her . You 're used to people and need them , ' she said with a curious lack of sympathy . Especially since the Richards did n't come up , ' Julia continued . ' We used to go over there all the time , or they came here . And the Harrises , too . That leaves only the Jacksons , of our friends , and they live on the other side of the village . ' Came through the Harris place . There 's a dead fox in their swimming pool . ' Our shutters need painting , ' Julia said . Maybe you should n't have come , ' Mrs. Jacobs said . I would n't have , but I wanted to get the children away from talk of war . That 's all they hear in the city . Even at school . Everywhere  --  war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't normal . I ca n't bear to think of them growing up to believe that war is the normal thing in life . ' Julia talked rapidly , as if she wanted to say a great deal before Mrs. Jacobs stood up again to leave . Is n't it ? ' ' War ? ' You fight weeds , or you fight to make money , or you fight to make a place in the world or to keep the one you 've got . ' But killing  --  I mean killing . That 's not normal . And breaking up homes , and lives . ' It 's harder for a woman like you , I guess , ' Mrs. Jacobs said . The war ? ' Your husband being away . ' What kind of woman am I ? ' Julia heard herself laugh nervously . Mrs. Jacobs looked at her squarely . I used to see the Doctor shake out your dustmop . ' Julia laughed again , easily . That 's nothing , ' she said . I 'm clumsy with my hands . See @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dust out of a mop . He has someP253knack with his wrists , so he could shake it quickly and --  The Doctor does for you . And the way you live , somebodyalways does for you . ' Oh , come now , Mrs. Jacobs . We 're not wealthy . I 've had two children . I manage a big house inWash ready ? ' Mrs. Jacobs asked abruptly , and stood up with a heavy sigh of finality . Do n't go ! ' Got supper to get . ' Julia opened the door and pulled out a white laundry bag , stuffed full , and Mrs. Jacobs swung it over her shoulder . Tuesday if it do n't rain , ' she said , and started off down the path . Once more Julia watched the blue dress flash between the trees , and , leaning slackly against the frame of the screen door , she continued to stare down the road long after Mrs. Jacobs had disappeared , until the dark trees blurred in her vision . A yell from the barn startled her . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered with dirt . Tom was howling . He danced up and down before Julia , flapping one hand and shouting , My hand ! My hand ! ' Rusty nail , ' Kate said wisely . Tom stopped his noise and clutched the wrist of the injured hand . It was n't rusty . ' Let me see ! ' Julia commanded . She had been trying vainly to take hold of Tom 's hand . Do n't squeeze ! ' he yelled . Do n't you be a baby , ' she said sternly . She turned the hand up and looked at the scratch on the palm . It was rather deep and it was not bleeding much - - the kind of wound which easily became infected . It was n't rusty , honest , ' Tom protested . Yes , it was , ' Kate said . Tom looked at his mother apprehensively . Do I need iodine ? ' P254Let 's not have another scene about iodine . All cuts need iodine , whether the nail is rusty or not . Your father is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Tom . ' He was pulling away from her in terror . It burns ! ' he wailed . Julia got a tighter grip on his wrist and tugged him close to her . Listen , Tom , ' she said severely , you 're seven years old . The last time you scratched yourself , I did n't force you to put iodine on it . And your foot got infected . You had to soak it in epsom salts for five days . Do you remember ? The water has to be very hot . A little stinging now  --  and it 's nothing at all  --  it 's better than an infection later . And you must get over this foolish fear . It gets worse and worse . Come along . ' He began to struggle with her . He braced his feet against the steps and pulled away from her . His face , under the streaks of dirt , was white and desperate . Julia 's lips tightenedwith resolution . She got behind him and put her hands under his arms and marched him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cried . No ! No ! No ! ' he begged , and his legs kicked out ahead of him . I 've got you , ' she cried . Do n't fight ! I 've got you ! ' Kate followed them . She had been grinning when they first appeared from the barn , but now she looked troubled . Julia felt for a moment that she would not be able to handle Tom , and it was only with what seemed to be a supreme demandupon her strength that she got him through the house to the small washroom off the kitchen . There she made him sit down on a chair . Then , as she turned to open the medicine chest , he tried to dart past her . But now she felt that the situation was hers . Very well , ' she said curtly . She took him by the arms and , in spite of his struggles , manoeuvered him into the corner near the medicine chest . Then she leaned against him and held him there withP255her weight while she opened the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She caught a glimpse of herself in the mirror . Her hair had fallen about her face , there was sweat on her forehead , and a streak of blood across her cheek from Tom 's scratch made her look savage . She was panting . As she took the stopper from the bottle , she saw Kate in the doorway , her dirty face frightened , her eyes wide and staring . Go away , Kate , ' Julia said as calmly as she could , but Kate did not stir . Tom , who had momentarily ceased his struggling and was sobbing quietly , now began to twist and turn and to yell again . His face was bright red as he arched his back and strained to free himself . Stop it ! ' Julia shouted angrily . Listen , you baby , ' she cried , you 're always wanting to hear about war . All right , I 'll tell you . Do n't you know what war is ? Men get killed ! They lose their arms and legs , they get blown to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or can any day ! And you 're afraid of a little iodine ! ' He was staring at her frantically , his eyes wild , but for the first time he was wholly quiet . She pulled his hand roughly to her , lifted the stopper from the bottle , and applied it . Toni gave a great shriek and freed his hand . He began to blow on it furiously . Julia pushed her hair out of her eyes . She put the iodine away . Kate watched her solemnly , and then suddenly turned round and went into the kitchen and out through the back door . Outside she began to sing . Julia walked into the kitchen and sank down on a chair beside an open window . She put her elbow on the sill and rested her head on her hand . Tom was sobbing quietly in the washroom , still huddled in the corner . Dimly , she heard him groan , Oh , you nut-head ! You nut-lead ! ' She remembered something Dick had told her once about the threshold of pain in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person , and that Tom was apparently even more sensitive to pain than most children . She clenched her hands in repentance . Nothing had been gained , nothing , and her head sank in the knowledge of a loss , instead . When she lifted her head and looked out of the window , she saw Kate wandering into the meadow which sloped up , behind the house , to the top of the hill and down to a wood on the other side . Only her shoulders and her brown hair were visible above the tall grass , but the thin song she sang came clearly back on the deadened evening air : ' My young man has gone to sea ; When he comes back , he 'll play with me . Tip to the heel and tip to the toe , That 's the way the polka goes . I have a bonnet trimmed with blue ... ' Julia started to get up . The sun was down now and the meadow was gray with twilight . She would have to bring the child back . But suddenly she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the chair and put her head on the window sill and began to cry . Strength was illusory . Everything was illusory , and above all now her past , which seemed suddenly as if she had never lived it or possessed it . Tom came out of the washroom and looked at her coldly for a moment . Then , tiptoeing across the kitchen , he too went outside , and once out , he began to run .   FBASER knew that his wife was still awake , but she would not say good-bye . It was snowing outside , a damp , heavy March snowfall that had already muffled the city and closed it in upon itself , and a queer white light that came in through the slats of the blinds showed him her face quite clearly . He stood beside her bed and watched her eyelids , sure that he could see them flicker , and he listened to her breathing , which was too quick for the breath of sleep . " Then he was suddenly aware of his own breath , fast and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could feel his heart beating . He went to the windows and closed the blinds quietly , and as he walked past his wife 's bed he stopped and said , Good-bye , dear , ' softly , and then went out of the room and across the hall into his study , where he kept his clothes . It was ten-thirty , time for him to leave . He took his shabby tweed overcoat and his battered hat out of his closet , put them on , picked up his overnight bag , snapped off the lamp on his desk , and went into the hall . He opened the door of Tim 's room and saw that he was covered to his chin and sleeping soundly . Then he started down the hall toward the living room , but stopped , turned round , and went back and looked into Hal 's room , too . In the living room , Fraser put the screen in front of the fireplace , even though little was left there but ash , and switched out the lights . In the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door into the foyer , checked the lock , and , just before going out , put his hand into his inner coat pocket to be sure he had his wallet , and then into his pants pocket to be sure he had his keys . When he got outside , he looked up at the apartment windows and saw that they were all black . The snow had been falling for four or five hours , and as Fraser started his walk to the Square , where he could take the subway to South Station , the soft , delightful hush over everything made him suddenly remember what it was like to be a boy in a snowstorm in a small town , and immediately he felt much better than he had since his quarrel with his wife an hour before . He hoped he would have time enough in New York to find some attractive present for her  --  she had long wanted some ear clips to wear with a particular pin  --  and then he gave his mind to the lecture he was to deliver at Princeton the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shuffled through it , and about his wife . He was to talk on The Prospects of a Liberal Peace , ' a subject which would involve him in a certain amount of fancy footwork if he was to please all the elements in his audience . And Fraser was determined to please . If the lecture was successful , he would almost certainly be offered the vacant chair in Political Economy . He was uncomfortably aware that it was already March ; his present appointment , since he had failed to get a permanent one , ended in June . On the subway platform he bought a Record and glanced at the front of it . There were big war headlines , then a large picture of a pretty girl and under that , the beginning of a story about her divorce . It brought the quarrel back to his mind . A train banged into the station and as Fraser got on it , he swore softly with irritation and shame . His wife had said , in perfectly good faith , he knew now , Why do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Princeton man , and I think he sometimes does work for the trustees . '  |p259Harold  ? What does he know about political economy ? Harold is a corporation lawyer . ' She hesitated . I mean , he has influence there . He could help you . ' Harold help me ? ' Why not ? He 'd be glad to . He 's perfectly friendly . ' They were in Fraser 's study . He was packing his bag . He had his back to her , and he could see his hands trembling . He made himself put his pajamas and a shirt into the bag before he answered , and he folded a tie meticulously and laid it on top of the shirt . Then he said , Is n't he a wonderful fellow ! So magnanimous . My God  --  Harold ! 1 Iarold ! Harold ! ' He faced her in a sudden fury of distress . Ca n't we ever get rid of him ? ' She closed her eyes . Are we on that again ? I 'm sorry I brought it up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , after all those years with him ? ' Four years , to be exact . I do n't think of him for days at a time , as you perfectly well know . But of course I ca n't forget him . Why should I ? For one thing , Hal happens to be his son . ' Fraser stared at her . Then , softly , he said , Yes , there 's that . And it reminds me of something I 've wanted to point out . You get a hundred and fifty a month for I ! al 's support . He 'll always be able to go to the best schools , as lie 's doing now . Next year Tim starts school , and on the kind of money I 've earned so far , he is n't going to be able to . Have you thought of that ? ' Yes , I have , ' she said quietly . It is n't very important . Tim is n't going to suffer . Would you rather have Hal have less ? ' Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes blazing at him . What are you at me for ? What have I done ? ' You have n't done anything , ' Fraser said . I 'd only like to know sometime how much you really regret . '   She stood up . You know , you 're crazy . I do n't regret anything . You make this up ! ' He could see her lower lip trembling , as it always did before she began to cry . She went to the door and turned round , and she was crying . If there had been no Jews in Germany , Hitler would have found somebodyelse . You used to tell me that . This is the same thing . ' What do you mean ? ' I mean that I do n't know what 's under your quarrels . All I know is that if you did n't have Harold to quarrel about , you 'd find something else . You like it that way . What do you want of me , anyway ? ' She did not wait for an answer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and closed the door . He stood still and stared at the closed white door , as he stared now at the gray tunnel walls flickering past the windows . Then the walls changed to gleaming white tiles , and the train stopped . Fraser read the signs  --  South Station Under . ' He had twisted the tabloid into shreds without opening it . When Fraser came into the station , he saw by the big round clock over the first newsstand that it was just eleven . His train did not leave until twelve-thirty , but he had had to come in early to pick up his reservation . He went into the waiting room to one of the Pullman windows and gave his name to the man behind the grill , and when he had his ticket , he walked out of the waiting room and stared at the clock again . It was ten minutes after eleven . He had a deep and uncomfortable feeling of self-disgust , and decided that what he wanted was a drink . He went outside and plowed through the thick snow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been before . Brassy music from the dining room at the right of the small lobby greeted him as he entered . He turned left and walked past groups of commercialtravelers , service men , and a few gaudy women toward the bar . At the entrance he gave his hat and coat and bag to the check girl , and hesitated a moment to see whereP261she would put his bag , which contained his lecture . Then he went into the dimly lit room . There was only one empty stool at the circular bar , and that was between two men who seemed to be talking together . Fraser paused tentatively behind them  --  one was a sailor , the other a portly civilian of about forty  --  but their conversation had broken off , and when they made no effort to move together , Fraser climbed up on the stool . He ordered bourbon and water , and when it was put down in front of him , he paid for it . Four dollars a night for a room in a flophouse . With bugs ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other man . Fraser leaned back so that the two could see each other . The civilian was not as respectable as he had at first appeared . His shirt collar was gray , and there was a day 's growth of stubble on his loose and somewhat blubbery face . His eyes were small and reddened and he looked at the sailor with an odd intensity . My ship docked yesterday morning . First thing I did was stop in a place to get a wallet , ' the sailor said , prodding his fingers into the pocket of his blouse and bringing out a small black billfold . Two-fifty . And look . ' I lc opened it and held it across Fraser to show the man that it had already cracked at the folds . Paper . ' Fraser took up his glass and studiously looked into it . The conversation was making him uncomfortable . It 's like I tell you , ' the heavy man said . I go into a joint for breakfast . A doughnut and a couple of eggs and coffee . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 'll roll you every time . ' Look at this bar . You would n't know a lot o ' guys had bled and died for ' em , would you ? What a town like this needs is a couple of bombs . ' The civilian flung out his hand , plump and hairless , in a gesture of disgust . This town 's the same as all of them . I travel a lot , and I see this country . It 's the same all over . The service man 's the sucker , and the civilian 's making the hay . What 's in it for you ? You 're giving the best years of your life for them , and maybe your life , and they 'll gyp you every time you move . But what do you expect with this government ? ' Fraser decided to get away . His drink was only half finished , and he did n't want to seem obvious about leaving , but he was afraid that if he stayed , he would be drawn into the conversation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face had flushed . He said , We 'll show ' em yet , do n't worry . ' Yeah ? How ? ' the civilian demanded aggressively . How ? Wait 'll we 're out . ' Wait 'll you 're out  --  in the breadlines . ' None of that stuff . Wait 'll there ai n't no S.P. 's around . ' Then what ? ' the civilian urged . We 're going to take over this country , and we 're going to run it the way we like it . For us , see ? ' Bud , now you 're talking . There 're a lot of people you got to fix up . I hope you do n't forget it . ' We wo n't forget it . We 're learnin ' plenty . ' Do n't you forget it , bud , do n't youFraser put down his half-emptied glass , slipped off the stool , and walked quickly out of the bar . He gave the girl at the coat rack his check and put a quarter down on her salver . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and came round to the side of it to help him with his coat . He turned to get into it , and found himself confronted by the sailor and the plump civilian . They were standing very close to him , both with their heads thrust forward , and he took a quick surprised half step back . So you do n't like us , ' the civilian said . Fraser got his arms into the sleeves of his overcoat and , asP263casually as possible , asked , What do you mean ? ' His voice sounded too high . I mean so you do n't like us . ' Fraser cleared his throat nervously . I did n't say anything to you . ' You left your drink . ' I 've got a train to catch . ' He put on his hat and picked up his bag . No you do n't , Jack , ' the sailor said , and , reaching out a big hand , seized the front of Fraser 's coat at his chest . If you do n't like what we were sayin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside and tell us why . ' Fraser heard the girl moving behind him . She had shoved aside the little table , and now she stepped between him and the sailor and pulled his hand off Fraser 's coat . You go have a drink , ' she said sweetly to the sailor . The gentleman has a little explaining to do , ' the civilian said with nasty emphasis . With her free arm , the girl pushed Fraser back . He glanced behind him and saw that she had cleared a space on the coat rack , and that behind it was a door . He ducked through the space , turned the knob , opened the door , and found himself outside . It seemed miraculous . Without waiting , he started to run across the street . The thick snow made running difficult , and when he got to the sidewalk beside the station , his heart was pounding and he was trembling all over . He walked swiftly to the first entrance he came to , and when he got inside he stopped and leaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure that he still had his wallet . As his fright drained away , and the episode began to seem a little foolish , he remembered his wife and the way he had left her . At the end of the wide corridor in which he stood were three telephone booths . He decided that he could not bring himself to get on his train without her forgiveness . The telephone rang for a long time before she answered ,   and when she did , he did not say what he had meant to say , but asked , Are you all right ? ' I 'm all right , ' she said . Are you ? ' He laughed shortly . Yes . Sure . ' You woke me . ' I 'm sorry . I could n't leave without asking you to forgive me . ' Of course , ' she said . I 'm sorry . I honestly am . I was very foolish . It 's all right . ' I do n't know why I go off the deep end that way . ' It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Make a good speech , wo n't you ? ' Good-bye , dear . ' Good-bye . ' He smiled to himself as he put back the receiver , bent to pick up his bag , and turned to open the door of the booth . But the smile changed slowly to a foolish grimace when he saw the two men waiting for him in the corridor . They stood by the opposite wall , directly in line with the phone booth . The sailor 's arms were folded over his pea jacket and he stood with his feet apart . The civilian 's hands were thrust into the pockets of his sagging gray coat , and his little eyes peered straight at Fraser from under the snapped brim of his hat . Automatically , Fraser shoved his foot against the fold in the door so that it could n't be opened . He kept it there as he reached in his pocket , turned to the telephone again , took up the receiver , and pretended to drop a nickel in the box . Then he dialled a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel the moisture of his palm against the receiver . Under his hatband , points of perspiration were forming , ticklinghis forehead . He decided that he would have to wait where he was until someone came through whom he could ask for help.  |p265With  his eyes on the corridor , but studiously off the two men , he moved his lips . At first he could bring out no sounds , and when he did begin to talk , the disjointed phrases which came from his mouth were fragments from the lecture he had so carefully prepared for the next day . He could think of nothing else . ... in a world miraculously diminished by new systems of communications and of transportation ... ' He paused . No one went by . ... the superb achievement of technology and the dire threat it contains ... ' I lc paused again , and with dismay saw an old man lumber drunkenly and obliviously toward the entrance . He waited as long as he could before he spoke again , and as he waited , two girls in shabby fur jackets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then did , too ; their eyes were fixed upon him . ... with our native proclivity to an isolation more arrogant than it is indolent ... ' ... the brutal force of the economically dispossessedwhich we can not expect again to palliate with ... ' He stopped . He could not go on . Sweat was streaming down his face , and he was suddenly limp with terror . He could not stay there any longer , trapped like some animal , helplessly . He would pull himself together now , open the door , and run for it . He could not believe his eyes when he saw a policeman slowly walk by toward the concourse , and at first he only gaped , until the officer was almost too far past to help him . Then abruptly he let the receiver bang down against the wall of the booth , seized his bag , violently pulled open the door , and called , Officer ! Officer ! ' For all his vocal effort , his voice was not loud , but was somehow strangled by his breath . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , please ? ' Fraser panted as he reached him . The officer pointed toward the big clock over the newsstand as they came into the concourse . About twelve . ' I thought I was late . ' Gratefully , Fraser saw that here there were plenty of people . P266You been running ? ' Yes . ' They walked along together toward the train gates . It 's a nasty night , is n't it ? ' Fraser said . Sure is . ' These March blizzards . . . ' He was still breathing heavily , and the policeman glanced at him with curiosity for the first time . Fraser laughed uncertainly . Well , my gate 's over there . Good night . ' Good night . ' Without glancing back , Fraser walked swiftly to Gate Twelve , where two conductors were sitting on high stools at a narrow table . Fraser faced the desk and looked over the heads of the men . No one was following him . He put his tickets on the desk and kept his eyes on the people moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , upper twelve , ' one of the conductorssaid . Thank you . ' He took his stub and passed through the gate . Immediately he realized that those men would not have dared to attack him back there at the telephone booth ; it was too public a spot . They had followed him simply to frighten him and amuse themselves . Then he was absolutely overwhelmed with shame . It was like something horribly physical , like a dreadful disease of his skin which had infected every inch of him , every pore ; but even then , as he was overcomeby the sensation of a scrofulous disgrace so strong that he nearly groveled under its force , his mind leaped to somethingelse . Walking uncertainly along the train to his car , it occurred to him with shattering conviction that sometime when he went away from home like this , on an overnight trip , or perhaps merely to a class for an hour , he would come back to find that the apartment was empty and that she had gone . He would shout , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IS WILLIAM B. BROWNE III . I am thirtyfiveyears old , decently educated , and successful in work which I do not exactly despise but which leaves me with an increasing sense of failure in the midst of accomplishment . I should state at once that I am a man of many discontents , and that I have not expected anyone but Mary , my wife , to view my problems with perfect seriousness . My discontents are probably chronic , and if in other professional circumstances they should disappear , I would no doubt develop a set of new ones . Yet , for myself , in the interior debate , I can not hold to irony . Nor can I dismiss my state of mind with a shrug , as I am prepared to have others dismiss it . Nor can I escape it simply by attributing it to modern history . All this is merely to say that although I am not at all suited to advise other men of unsettled mind , I was expected to perform that function for Jeff Grandison . Betty Grandison'sinvitation had made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week-end party . She was not really equipped to entertain people in the place where she and Jeff and their child had spent the summer . But summer had slipped into autumn , and they were still there , and she had arranged the week-end at last because Jeff had to be stirred up . I had been asked because I am a lawyer , which Jeff had planned to be , and because his father had been a senior partner in my firm before his death and because it had always been understood that   when Jeff finished law school , there would be a place in the firm for him . The war had interrupted Jeff 's career . At the end of his first year at law school , he was commissioned in the Navy , and now that he had been discharged , he showed no inclination to return . , I was to help persuade him . The other man Betty had chosen was a young scientist friend of theirs , one of those brilliant young men whom the war had really created and who now enjoy such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Betty hoped that either his great self-confidence or his conspicuous success or both togetherwould stimulate Jeff to efforts of his own . Mary and I did not know either the scientist or the girl he was bringing with him , and we had no reason to think that they were the rather noisy couple who sat a few seats away from us on the train that took us to the shore . All the way these two laughed uproariously over some childish game they were playing with their fingers . Mary and I did not talk much . We sat with our arms linked , our shoulders pressed together , thinking of nothing , but close . We have long taken each other for granted , and we have been , I suppose , dependent on each other in the way that only childless people are if they depend on each other at all . When we got off the train , Betty Grandison and a man in Navy grays whom we first took to be Jeff were waiting for us . Betty waved , and as we came closer we saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Mac , ' Betty said . Lieutenant McLaughlin . ' He was a man in his late twenties , with a dark , preoccupied face and a somber air , but his voice was friendly and seemed slightly Southern . We thought you were Jeff , ' Mary said . We thought Jeff was back in uniform . ' Where is Jeff ? ' I asked . Jeff is at home , ' Betty said . ' He does n't stir any moreP269unless he has to . ' She was looking about her , up and down the length of the train as she talked , and then she waved . There they are , ' she said . They were the noisy people . The girl was very handsome , thin and dark , with glossy black hair , a high color , and beautiful teeth . She was wearing well-tailored black slacks , and she looked as though she had been living in the country , not as though she had just come down from the city . She was waving one arm and shouting , Hi , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not tower over her man , but the man did not seem to be disturbed by her height . He was short and slightly rotund , and he carried himself with an easy , bouncing jauntiness which struck me as comic until I discovered his arrogance . He wore no tie , and as he came toward us the wind blew his unbuttoned , wrinkled seersucker coat behind him , and we could hear his moccasins flap along the platform . Clearly , he was without any interest in the impression he conveyed . Hello ! ' Betty said warmly . Lynn Barker and Pat Dorius . Meet Mary and Bill Browne , and Mac McLaughlin . Mac was in Africa and Sicily with Jeff , and now he 's stationednear here . ' Hello , hello , hello , ' said Lynn Barker brightly to each of us as she performed three little motions which were to suggestcurtsies . Hi , ' said Pat Dorius , and he shook hands laconically with McLaughlin and me . Lynn Barker was hardly twenty , and Pat Dorius could not have been more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which commented both on our age and our dress . We would be , it was clear , the oldest people at the Grandisons , and objectionable as both of us already found Dorius and his girl , we were aware that they rather than we had accurately estimated the week-end . It was hot and they looked comfortable . Mary was wearing a black city dress with satin insets and a new fall satin hat and some heavy silver jewelry and open-toed shoes with spike heels . I was wearing the dark-blue suit I had worn to work that morning and a detachable collar on a Finchley shirt . We had looked good to each other when we met in the station after lunch , but now Mary looked overdressed , and I felt stuffy and uncomfortable as I stood listening to Pat Dorius tell how he and Lynn had seen us on the train but had not thought that we were the other Grandison guests ! Does it all seem rather trivial ? It would be , perhaps , if it were not that Mary and I have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we 're all here , ' said Betty , holding down the skirt of her gingham dirndl as the hot wind suddenly blew at it . Let 's go . ' We piled the luggage in the back of her car and got in . Mary was squeezed between Betty and me in the front seat , and when the car started she took off her hat and held it in her lap . How long are you staying on here , Betty ? ' Mary asked . Ask Jeff . I honestly do n't know . I wish I did . It 's comfortableenough in a ramshackle way , but I hate loose ends , and ever since Jeff got out of the Navy , we 've had only loose ends . Ile wo n't make up his mind to go back to law school . Now he thinks he wants to do something else entirely . " But what ? " I ask him , and he does n't seem to know what , and he does n't do anything . ' It was a long speech for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a quiet girl , with an unusual serenity in manner and a calm brevity in speech . I leaned forward to speak to her , and she looked harried and nearly gaunt . The wind lifted her loose blond hair away from her cheeks , and her pretty face , in spite of the healthy tan , was tired . She looked older than Mary , whose round white face was , as usual , placid . I said , We must not urge him to go on with law if he does n't want to . That was my mistake . I let my fatherP271urge me . I wanted to be a journalist . A liberal journalist . We have yet to develop a really enlightened political analysis of current events in this country . ' For the first time J felt that it was vaguely sickening to hear myself say that , I had heard myself say it so often before . Bill 's never been happy in law , ' Mary said , but it 's too late now to change . ' It was a contented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often , and I felt a moment 's wild irritation with Mary for assuming so complacently that it was indeed too late now . Bill , ' Betty said earnestly , work on Jeff , please , wo n't you ? ' The anxiety in her plea brought my mind abruptly back to her problem . We were in the country now . It was October , and it was strange to see the woods so gaudy when the temperature was like July . Dead leaves blew down from the trees , and every now and then the speed of the open car whipped a spray of leaves , like small birds , up over our heads . The ocean flashed darkly blue between the trees , and the beaches looked white and hot . Betty turned on to a side road and then , lowering her voice , she said , There 's one other thing . Let the bedroom situation ride . ' What do you mean ? ' Mary asked . Well , Lynn and Pat . Everyone knows they 're sleeping together  --  he 's waiting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know if they know that everyone knows . Let it take care of itself . I think I have it fixed . ' The car was slowing down and she added , I Jere we arc . ' We all looked at the modest bungalow with its brown , shingled sides , and as the car turned into the drive , we all saw a boy in the front yard throw a croquet mallet at a small black and white dog . The mallet caught the dog smartly on the rump and sent him yipping shrilly in pain and terror round the farther side of the house.  | Pat half stood up in the back seat . Why , that dirty --  Shh ! ' Betty said . The boy was nineteen or twenty and had on a dark-blue shirt which hung out over his trousers . A girl , obviously pregnant , with long , yellow , fuzzily permanented hair and a big pompadour , stood leaning indifferently against the porch . Betty drove slowly to the barn behind the house . Do n't you know who that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' That dirty --  ' Pat started to say again . He 's Joe Henry , ' Betty said , the war hero . ' My God ! ' I exclaimed . What a nasty temper , ' said Mary . But he looks like a caddy ! ' shrieked Lynn Barker , and as we " got out of the car , she said , And the white trash live in the barn . ' We laughed politely . Jeff was waiting for us . He was slouched down in a big wicker chair and did not get up when we came in . He was wearing dungarees , but he had no shirt on and his feet were bare . His chest looked caved in and his face was white and empty . Greetings , ' he said amiably . Everyone exclaimed about the barn . The room was enormous , with windows at the back and large panes set into the original sliding doors at the front . Three small bedrooms were partitioned off along one side of the room , and a bedroom , a bath , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loft had been removed , and the beamed interior of the tall roof was completely exposed except for one side , where the wall that shut off the three bedrooms continued up . Rough stairs near the back of the room led to a landing and a door in that wall . Through the back windows , perhaps a quarter of a mile away , the ocean flashed darkly between sable tree trunks . Sit down , ' Jeff said . We 're here for the winter . All we do is light that stove . . . . ' He turned his head just enough to indicate a round , airtight stove near the windows . P273We are not here for the winter , and will you please put a shirt on ? ' Betty said . You look peaked , kid , ' Lynn Barker said . Where 's that old Navy brawn ? ' I 'm okay , ' Jeff said . Sit down or I 'll have to get up . ' No , ' said Betty . Let 's get the room situation fixed up first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in there , and Betty JaneWhere is Betty Jane ? ' Mary asked , and the eagerness in her voice reminded me that when people tell us occasionally that we really ought to have children , my first impulse is always to tell them that we have not tried not to have them . But I usually say , instead , that it is my observation that children heighten rather than solve the problems of their parents . Betty Jane 's in the bathroom , ' Jeff said . Betty went on . That leaves the room next to the bathroomon this floor , and upstairs are two rooms . Now we can put Betty Jane in with us , but I thought if Lynn and Pat would use the two rooms upstairs , then the BrownesThat 's fine , ' Pat said . Okie-dokie , ' said Lynn . Can I telephone ? ' Mac asked Jeff . Stop asking , ' Jeff replied . We picked up our luggage and started toward our rooms , and then Jeff called out , Do n't mind Mac , he telephones all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come live with him . ' Put your shirt on , ' Betty said , and when he did not stir , she went into their bedroom and came out with a sweat shirt and a pair of sneakers . She threw them at him and they landed in his lap . Mac was clicking impatiently at the telephone . He began to say , Hello ! Hello ! Hey , hello ! ' P274We changed our clothes . I got into flannels and a tennis shirt , and Mary put on a tweed skirt and a green linen blouse and some espadrilles . As I was about to open the door , she said , I still do n't feel just right , ' and it was true that she did not look just right , that now she looked very short . Mary needs high heels . Jeff must have heard her through the thin walls . You alwayslook good , Mary , ' he said . He had put on the sweat shirt and the sneakers , but he was still in the wicker chair . How about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jane , ' she called from the kitchen . Are you crippled ? ' I 'm crippled , ' he answered pleasantly , and when he did not stir , I said , Let me . ' Jeff raised no objections and I went out to the kitchen . Betty Jane , the Grandison 's fouryear-old , was sitting on a stool at the kitchen table , and Betty leaned over the table , holding out a spoonful of cereal . That 's what I mean about Jeff , ' she said softly . He wo n't move . Sometimes I think it 's some disease he picked up in Africa ... ' She had thrust the spoon into the child 's mouth , and now she was scooping a dollop of the cereal off her chin . The child had Betty 's wide brown eyes and yellow hair , and a kind of solemn poise which was like Betty , too , when she was less nervous than now . There 's the liquor , ' she said . How about daiquiris ? ' There are lemons in the ice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large tray , Betty kept whispering to me . Remember , Bill , he 's twenty-seven years old . He 's been away from law school for almost four years . I do n't know  --  perhaps it 's too late already . . . It is n't the uncertainty I mind so much , the insecurity . . . Do you remember his tennis game , the terrific game he used to play , and how he loved it ? Well , now . . . ' She really did not give me an opportunity to reply . P275As I came into the living room with the cocktail tray , the upstairs door opened and Lynn appeared on the landing . She cried , Why , Betty , you cute thing , there really are two rooms up here . ' Of course , ' Betty shouted . Lynn came down and sat on the floor next to Jeff . She had let her hair down and instead of her black jacket , she had put on a tight red wool sweater . What 's Joe Henry doing here ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' Mary asked . Mac , looking scrubbed , came out of his room . Ile had taken off his blouse and he looked younger in his shirt , clean and dark and angry . He 's the one that lied his way in when he was sixteen , ' he said . He got the Bronze Star at Normandy , the Silver Star in the Bulge , and finally he jumped up in the middle of a lot of cross-fire somewhere in Germany and laid out twenty-three krauts with his last grenade . Ile saved a platoon . Then he got the Congressional Medal . ' And then , ' Jeff said sourly , he got the works . ' When he 's got his medals on , he ca n't straighten up , ' Mac said . Mac , how 's the scrap drive ? ' Jeff laughed . Jokes of that sort irritate me . I believe that the war , in spite of the utterances of some of our military men and the cynicism of most of our diplomats , was fought on ideological grounds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I said , I do n't think that 's very funny . ' No one paid any attention . But why is Joe Henry here ? ' asked Lynn , and then she glanced up and said , Hello , darling , ' to Pat , who was just coming out on their landing . Pat looked exactly as he had before , except that his coat was more wrinkled . I had a nap . My God , how will I get in my sleep in the atomic age ? ' He came jauntily down the stairs and looked at the tray . Rum cocktails ! Whose idea was that ? '
