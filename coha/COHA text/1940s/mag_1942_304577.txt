The tragic irony of the U.S. 's steel shortage was underscored last week by a new report on how much steel the U.S. can now produce . According to the American Iron &; Steel Institute , U.S. steel capacity ( conservatively rated a good 2% below all-out capacity ) was stepped up 628,350 tons in the first half of 1942 to a colossal 89,198,320-ton total . The increase alone meant enough ingots to build twelve more Victory ships or 1,200 medium tanks every month , and the new total represents 50% of all the world 's steel and almost half again as much as the U.S. had at the end of World War I. Moreover , since World War II broke out , the U.S. has added nearly 8,000,000 tons to its steel plant-more than the total capacity now available to Japan . Another 9,000,000 tons is being rushed to completion by the middle of 1943 . But so far the U.S. is not using within 5,000,000 tons of its present full capacity . <P> <P> To boost war bond sales , Chicago 's 40-year-old Belden Manufacturing Co. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dividends in war savings stamps , beginning with a 37 payment voted last week for Sept. 1 .
