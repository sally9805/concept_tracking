Members of the A.F.L. 's beefy executive council had cat-footed through the first stages of their convention in San Francisco , nervously aware of a cloud , no bigger than a ham , hanging on the horizon . The cloud was John L. Lewis , eleventh vice president of the A.F.L. <P> John was determined to take the A.F.L. headlong into a struggle with the Government over the Taft-Hartley Act . The council was just as opposed to the Act as he was , but unwilling to fight on John 's line , which was a technicality over signing an anti-Communist affidavit . The council members wanted to avoid the issue by wiping out their titles of vice president , a technicality which would relieve them of legal responsibility under the law . What would John do ? One raucous day last week , he strode to the platform and thundered : " Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the . corn . " Then , for 58 minutes , while President Green blinked and occasionally closed his eyes ( see cut ) and while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lewis sizzled and poured . <P> Stately Asses . He called the Taft-Hartley law " the first ugly , savage thrust of fascism in America , " and shouted : " Is it true that the leaders of our movement are to be the first to put their tails between their legs and run like cravens before the threat of that bill ? <P> " I am reminded , " he said , " of the biblical parable , ' Lions led by asses ' ... intellectually fat and stately asses . . . . <P> " I will not be a candidate for election to this debased executive board . Perhaps you will say , ' John Lewis is trying to hold a gun to the head of the convention . ' I do n't think that the federation has a head . I think its neck has just grown up and haired over . " <P> Belly-Crawlers . John had indeed tried to hold a gun at the haired-over neck , but it did n't go off . Uncle Dan Tobin , boss of the teamsters , rose up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . the Brotherhood of Teamsters never crawled in their lives . " George Meany , ex-plumber and secretary-treasurer of the A.F.L. , declared : <P> " Of course the president of the United Mine Workers has upheld the position of the United Mine Workers in regard to Communism . With his right hand from 1935 to 1940 when Lewis was boss of C.I.O. he has upheld the position of the United Mine Workers in uncompromising resistance to Communism ; but with his left hand he made a fellowship with Harry Bridges , Julius Emspak , Michael Quill , Lew Merrill , *and all the other stinking American-haters who love Moscow . " <P> Meany sat down amidst loud applause , the " delegates overwhelmingly passed the motion abolishing their vice presidents . <P> When the time came for the formal election of the 13 council members , John L. had disappeared . He would have nothing to do with a " debased , denatured and dehydrated council . " Daniel Tracy , boss of the electrical workers , was elected to his place . John L. had failed in his effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , held the spotlight . <P> <P> *Bosses respectively of C.I.O. 's longshoremen , electricians , transport workers . Merrill recently retired as president of the office workers .
