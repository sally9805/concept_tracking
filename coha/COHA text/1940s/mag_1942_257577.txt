One early morning long ago , before Hitler was master of Germany , the late Hangman Reinhard Heydrich rushed to see his Fhrer on a matter of desperate urgency . He tramped through an anteroom to the Fhrer 's bedroom and . with his usual disregard of anything that stood in his way , drove his heavy boot into the body of a man who was lying in front of Adolf Hitler 's door to protect him from assassination . <P> The sleeping bodyguard , a big , tough veteran of World War I , got to his feet . He had two broken ribs . Perhaps it was unfortunate for Heydrich that Hitler was within hearing . Otherwise Heydrich might easily have died , sooner , to be sure , but more quickly and pleasantly than he did last month in Czecho-Slovakia . <P> The man whose ribs Heydrich had broken was Erwin Eugen Johannes Rommel , now a field marshal of the German Reich . The only man on earth whom Rommel looks up to is Hitler . And he looks down contemptuously on all other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military men Rommel is now variously appraised as : 1 ) a bold and brilliant desert commander who makes mistakes like any other ; 2 ) the best armored-force general of World War II ; 3 ) one of the great military commanders of modern times . The outcome of the battle for Egypt and the Middle East may well settle Rommel 's place in history . <P> Whatever his place , he is such a man as some of the commanders Napoleon assembled around him in his youth : tough , untutored , plebeian , successful . The German radio recently quoted him as saying : <P> " If you kick an Englishman in the stomach today , in the teeth tomorrow and on his behind the day after , he will be unable to stand it . His command can not adapt itself to such measures . " <P> The remark was quite in character . <P> Self-Made General . In common with Hitler , Rommel is no Prussian aristocrat . His father was a schoolteacher in south Germany . Like most German boys who were born in 1891 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Army . He started the war as a humble lieutenant , but his war record was remarkable . <P> Commanding a detachment of mountain troops in the first battle of Champagne ( 1915 ) , he captured an important French position , forced a whole French brigade to retire . ( Reward : Pour le Mrite , highest Prussian military decoration . ) In 1917 Rommel distinguished himself against the Italians at the Isonzo . Recently the Germans , with characteristic tact , reminded their World War II allies by stating , in a radio sketch of his life , that Rommel " captured 9,000 Italian troops in less than half an hour .
