OPM last week announced progress in U.S. defense : military aircraft production for the first six months of 1941 had increased 42% over the production of the preceding six months . <P> Like most figures , this one was too simple . Since a great slice of new military aircraft building at the end of 1940 was trainers-badly needed by the Air Forces but useless for combat-the figures behind this figure were more significant . <P> In the first half of 1941 U.S. aircraft factories had got going with a bang on fighting planes . Output of two-engined bombers was up 92% ; single-engined dive-bombers and torpedo carriers , 146% ; pursuit , observation and other combat aircraft , 142% . Only in the production of four-engined bombers was there little or no gain in the first half of 1941 , but there was reason to expect that there would be plenty in the second half , with Consolidated ( B-24s ) and Boeing ( B-17s ) getting into high-speed production . <P> The increase in U.S. aircraft production in six months : 1,036 military planes in January @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
