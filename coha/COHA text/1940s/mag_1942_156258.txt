The President , like the people , is in trouble . His desk is piled high with unsolved problems . There is the threat of inflation , the lag in production , the lack of unity in his Army &; Navy-to say nothing of far-flung problems of democratic unity throughout the world ( see P-25 ) . <P> In such a situation , the President needs able men . He already has working for him many of the ablest men in the country ( see p. 20 ) . But still last week the President seemed to be looking for a man-a man whom he could trust and a man whom the public trusts . <P> To whom could he turn ? There was , inevitably , Elder Statesman Bernard M. ( " Bernie " ) Baruch , production tsar of World War I. The President ( said informal sources ) was thinking about him . Baruch is 72 years old but carries his 6 ft. 3 in. height with gusty vigor . <P> On the count of foreknowledge , Baruch might well be the man . Years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interrelated that no single step should be taken without adjustments in all fields . Understanding the whole , he might help mightily with a part . <P> Baruch has two other great advantages : it is certain that he would surround himself with aides of unquestioned integrity and ability ; and no man is more conscious than Franklin Roosevelt of Bernard Baruch 's loyalty to his President .
