In the Arctic icefields off Newfoundland 's east coast , hardy , wind-bitten swilers ( sealers ) were out on their annual seal hunt . <P> With sirens screaming and bunting gay in the rigging , a dozen stout-planked ships had slipped through the Narrows of St. John 's Harbor and out of sheltered northern ports . If they came back in four to eight weeks with prime pelts stowed fore &; aft , every swiler would get around $200 apiece for his voyage . If they came back clean , both they and the merchants who backed them would get nothing . As always , the hunt was a gamble . <P> The terms of the gamble had long been set by law and custom : no seals , no pay . The risk is great . The rafting ice might shear off a rudder or propeller , or jam the ship so long it would miss the main patch of seals . But the adventure still thrills the hardy Newfoundland fishermen . <P> They know that each spring , without fail , the harp seals ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet the Arctic ice floes , honeycomb them with blowholes , whelp near the holes in late February . In three weeks , the ravenous young cats weigh about 70 pounds , are prime young " whitecoats . " <P> The Slaughter . Newfoundland swilers are old hands at blasting and nudging their craft clear into the whelping ground . There the barrel man , high in the crow's-nest , spots the whitecoats . The ship runs alongside , the men grab a gaff ( a pole with a steel hook on the end ) and clamber overside . They race to kill the first whitecoat and bring back its tail to dip it ceremoniously in a glass of rum as a toast to a bumper trip . <P> Once in the patch , the slaughter begins . A sharp blow on the nose with the gaff kills the seal , a few deft strokes of the knife and the pelt is sculped off . All day long the killing goes on ; the ice runs red with blood . At night the crewmen trudge back to cramped quarters aboard ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of black tea . Then a night 's sleep , fully clothed , a breakfast of " fish and brew is " ( boiled hardtack ) , and off on the ice again . In a good day a sealer can sculp 120 seals . <P> In St. John 's and the outports , the return of the sealers would be anxiously awaited , for the seal hunt and tragedy have long been synonymous . But when they come back , badly in need of a bath and reeking of blubber , the sealers will be able to make a few more dollars by selling flippers ( up since the war from $1 a dozen to $1 apiece ) to housewives for flipper pies . The flippers , which taste something like saltwater duck , are one of Newfoundland 's national dishes .
