For the past year the British working classes have grown increasingly aware that they were getting two negatives where they wanted two affirmatives . Last week they had good reason to exult . To one demand ( the other is a second front ) the British Home Secretary , Laborite Herbert Morrison , finally said " Yes , " permitting the resurrection of the British Communist newspaper , the Daily Worker . The decision was proof that labor could still control its leaders by agitation . <P> Until 1941 the Daily Worker had been a noisy ragamuffin of British journalism . In a country where newspaper circulations run to millions , only " about 100,000 " workers bought it . When war came the Worker followed the Communist Party into guerrilla warfare against His Majesty 's Government , and in January 1941 Herbert Morrison 's Home Office banned it . Solemn Scotland Yarders moved into the printing offices , solemnly played rummy while the Worker staff got out appeals against the ban . The public , with blitz problems at hand , reacted only dimly . <P> When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the home front . But the buried Daily Worker could report its change of heart only by clamorous broadsheets . The broadsheets appeared in factory canteens , at churchhall meetings of workers , at Friends-of-Russia rallies . Herbert Morrison appeared not to notice them . <P> But as a Labor Party leader , the Home Secretary could not fail to note other phenomena . The Communist Party 's paying membership jumped from 20,000 in January to 53,000 in June . Londoners , with vehement regularity , jammed Trafalgar Square , 30,000 strong , to approve demands for a second front and revival of the Worker . The Labor Party voted a resolution against the ban . One after another , unions of miners , railwaymen , textile workers , locomotive drivers and journalists cried for the Worker . <P> By last week the Communist Party 's ragamuffin had grown in public sentiment to a full-sized martyr , and Herbert Morrison , whose minority party exists by trade-union support , had no kidney for a test of strength . <P> Reprieved from martyrdom , the Daily Worker , admittedly controlled and owned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work , arranged a public stock issue to pay for replacements of its blitzed presses , planned , as promised , to help Britain win the war . First issue , it announced , would appear at the national trade-union meeting .
