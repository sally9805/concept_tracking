THE BRANNAN PLAN THE TAXPAYERS of the nation spend millions of dollars each year in subsidies to farmers . New and greater subsidies are proposed in each Congress by both parties ? as indeed they must be . With every farm bill that is passed , the real grievance of the city people grows deeper . They pay taxes to support the farmer so that he can grow the food which they ' need to eat . Do they then get it at a price which reflects the money they have already invested in subsidies ? They do not ? as eggs at 99 cents a dozen prove every day . On every front , agricultural products are available in unparalleled abundance , while , paradoxically , the city consumer pays the inflationary prices associated with the lean years of scarcity . A Democratic administration , which has its basic voting strength in industrial city workers , could have been expected , sooner or later , to become conscious of the political danger inherent in this picture . That it has now awakened is to the credit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposing the Brannan Plan , has found a way out of the dilemma which now restricts consumption of agricultural produce by the city worker . The essence of Brannan 's proposal is simple ? let the eggs , the cheese , the milk and all other products for which the farmer receives payment at a high government support price , find their own price level on the grocer 's shelves . With a glut overhanging the market , those prices will be low , and the city worker will get the benefit of ' the money he has paid in taxes to help the farmer maintain a standard of living comparable to that of the skilled city worker . In every way ? and especially politically ? the first part of that proposition , reasonable prices , appeals to the city worker . The second part , a sustained high income , has an equal appeal to the family farmer . The two parts together constitute the makings of a political coalition , the beginnings of which can already be seen in some states . The Brannan Plan is building up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as editors , commentators and the politicians of both parties pontificate that it is only a memory . At the very same time that Governor Dewey , campaigning for the election of Senator ? Dulles , was telling upstate New York audiences that a vote for Dulles is a vote against " the package phony Brannan Plan , " the Republican National Committee 's farm meeting in Sioux City was hearing demands from farmers for a Republican type of Brannan Plan . At the Democratic Party meeting in San Francisco , in late September , the story was the same . The party workers and leaders of the West were reflecting a grassroots feeling for Brannan and his plan , a feeling not shared by most politicians ? or indeed by the leaders of the biggest farm organization , the American Farm Bureau Federation . From the day that the Brannan Plan was announced , the leaders of the Bureau led an envenomed attack on it . In some circles this attack was thought to be the consequence of Allen Kline 's personal feeling of bitterness . Kline , head of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now held by Brannan was logically his own . But that personal feeling , however strong it is , was not the decisive factor which brought the Bureau 's big guns to bear on the Brannan Plan . The Farm Bureau , though it has enrolled many small farmers in some states , is the voice and the apparatus of the very biggest factory-farm operators of the country . The Brannan Plan favors the operator of the small farm ? Brannan Plan subsidy benefits decline as farm operations become larger ? a provision which is anathema to big farmers . The Brannan Plan insists on prescribed minimum soil-conservation practices , acreage allotments and marketing quotas . Though none of these is a new departure in farm legislation , the big farmers oppose them all and have hoped to do away with them . Along with their opposite numbers in industry they demand subsidies , while they term all regulation " statism , " " regimentation " and " the welfare state . " Moreover , and quite naturally , the big farmers of the Bureau are monopoly-minded . Kline spelled this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's a good thing to emphasize the complete interest of all the rest of the economy in having a relatively few people produce the necessary food . " The Brannan Plan will eliminate the opportunity for the big squeeze on small farmers . Finally the Farm Bureau is in firm control of the most effective apparatus in government ? the County Agent system , operated jointly by the Department of Agriculture and the Land Grant Colleges . This is the most vital of all the Bureau 's instruments , since its in-. fluence is felt on . every farm in the land . The Brannan Plan , building ? as it does ? the strength of the small farmer , is bound to cut the Farm Bureau County Agent monopoly down to size , and this the Bureau can not brook . Every reason that the Farm Bureau has for opposing the Brannan Plan is a reason for the National Farmers Union to support it ? which it has done vigorously since the plan was announced . This is the organization of family farmers who own and operate the acres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles of soil conservation and of regional development and they believe equally firmly in the coalition of interest of the working farmer and the working people of the cities . The NFU also realizes that government is now the decisive factor in the stability of agricultural economy and it wants to move the small farmer into the position of influence with government which is now occupied by the Farm Bureau through the County Agent system . Finally , it is committed irrevocably to the proposition that the family farmer shall receive an income on a par with that gained by any other group of workers in the nation . As soon as the Brannan Plan was announced , the leaders of the NFU undertook to convince Senators and Representatives of the merits of the plan ; but with its philosophy and approach , the NFU did not find a welcome awaiting it in the offices of most of the Southern delegations , who immediately saw a threat to the plantation operations to which they are so firmly wedded . Congressmen who do the bidding of the Associated Farmers in California and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are , first and foremost , spokesmen of the great ranchers , were equally hostile . Confronted with this lineup , the NFU moved out into the grassroots to do its convincing and the fur began to fly . In Alabama , Aubrey . Williams , president of the Alabama Farmers Union , debated the Brannan Plan , with the state president of the Farm Bureau in the columns of the Montgomery Advertiser . Farmers read the arguments pro and con carefully . They began to ask questions , in letters to their local papers and especially in the meetings of their farm organizations . A fire was lit . Heat from that fire is already singeing the Bureau . Today Alabama leaders of the Farmers Union report a tremendous increase of interest in their organization ? an interest which grows directly out of the small farmer 's belief that the Bureau has let him down . And as the conviction grows that it is the Brannan Plan which will supply his needs , the farmer 's letters to his Congressmen grow more emphatic . Alabama is not foremost in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respected Wallace 's ' Farmer and Iowa Homesteader polled its readers and found that of the farmers who knew about the Brannan Plan , more liked the sound of it than did n't . Minnesota has had two polls ? independently taken . The last vote was ten to four in favor of the Brannan Plan : The great future political significance in these figures is made clear by looking at the record of the 1948 Truman victory . In Iowa Truman 's majority was less than 35,000 . In Minnesota it was less than 184,000 . In these terms the Brannan Plan is readying a fine crop of political hay for reaping in the coming elections : This time , the efforts of the NFU are decisive . In Iowa , in Minnesota and in all the other states which are ordinarily Republican , the NFU is beating the bushes . State presidents debate the officials of the Farm Bureau . Polls become ammunition . In Arkansas a poll revealed that 56 of every 100 Bureau members were in favor of the Brannan Plan ? despite the fact that both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bureau are vociferously on record against it . The meetings , the results of the polls and the discussion in the country papers are riddling Farm Bureau morale as applications for membership begin to come to the NFU from dissident Farm Bureau members . In one township in Minnesota last year the Farmers Union did not have a single member . Today 47 of the 68 farmers in the township have joined the NFU ; only one signed up with the Bureau . According to James Patton , president of the National Farmers Union , the drive toward the Brannan Plan and his own organization is firmly based on the agricultural facts of life . The yields of both wheat and corn are straining the storage capacity of the country . A vast new cotton crop is crowding the 5.25-million-hale surplus carried over unused from 1948 . In storage now are 203 million dozen eggs , 175 million gallons of dried milk , 55 million pounds of butter and 2.25 million pounds of cheese . The production ' of potatoes and of many other crops far exceeds the present demand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is helping farmers to realize the political meaning of the great revolution in agriculture which has characterized the last ten years . Since 1940 , crop yields per acre have increased by more than 25 percent . In the next decade the gains are expected to be even more spectacular . The reasons are to be found in improved technology , in the reduction of rate of soil loss and in the reinvigoration of soils which had become impoverished . Agricultural technology is in its infancy and it is on the growth of this factor that the predictions are made for greater acceleration of production in the future . Patton expresses the problem in these words , " We have got to learn to live with abundance and like it . " Politically the farmer 's security is wedded to the worker 's ability to get all the food he wants at reasonable prices . If the farmer is to have the benefit of continuing support by the taxpayers , last year 's waste can not be often repeated . In 1948 , according to Secretary Brannan , " Taxpayers bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no good out of them , " a situation duplicated in many other foods . The politics of abundance demand coalition between farmer and worker . In the Brannan Plan , the leaders of the NFU see a welding iron with which an active , . political farmer-worker alliance can be created . This , of course , has always been a liberal pipe dream , except during the early thirties when both groups were economically shattered and on relief together . The missing economic link may be found in the Brannan Plan . Secretary Brannan and the Democratic high command are obviously proceeding on this theory . Brannanhas been given the green light . Though his travels are less publicized , he has already roamed as widely as the President to take his program to the country . In the next months Brannan will be all over the lot . The Republicans will be fighting him with the same success that they would a feather bed , since they have no pro gram for the small farmer and they have no hope of carrying the cities . Meanwhile , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the United States Chamber of Commerce , the metropolitan press and the radio will continue to smother news of the Brannan Plan . When they mention it at all , it will be to remark that " the vicious regimentation of the Brannan Plan has been buried under a wave of protest from the farmers them selves . " And Congress , tied in knots because it does not want a farm program which favors small farmers any more than it wants a program which would favor small business or workers , has passed a bill which , though it grants high price supports , favors the big farmer and gouges the consumer . The act , passed on the last day of the session , is in the grand tradition of Congressional stalling . The stalling is a bluff which will be called in the elections to come . There will be only a few political tests of the Brannan Plan this year . But even those few will shake the boys who think they have buried it . In 1950 and ' 52 , the Brannan Plan will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , Congress will enact a new farm bill ? one which is based on low prices for consumers and a high standard of living for family farmers .
