txt Percentage or Permillage ? To Sports Editor of The New York Times : I should like to suggest that you institute an innovation in baseball nomenclature . Club averages and batting averages are spoken of as percentages . For instance , a batting average of .342 is referred to as a percentage . This , of course , is incorrect , the percentage in such an instance actually being 34.2 . The correct term for batting averages as now expressed is per millage . The baseball public might be a bit slow in accepting the change ; it would seem odd at first . But I am sure the change could be put over if the baseball authorities would adopt it . Permillage and per mille are perfectly good words . Both the Webster and Standard dictionaries list them and there is no reason why they should not be used where they apply . ARTHUR C. PERRY . Central Valley , N. Y. , June 30 , 1941 Editorial Note : Quite right . Percentage is the wrong term , but the baseball fan has accepted it @ @ @ @ @ @ @
