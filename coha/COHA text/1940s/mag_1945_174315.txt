This week , on doctor 's orders , the grand old man of Southern football quits as coach of Georgia Tech . Football coaches everywhere accepted Bill Alexander as a blackboard wizard . Season after season , he thought up new ways to baffle old opponents , put new twists on old tricks . No man to keep his opinions to himself , he argued doggedly against the huddle ( because it slowed the game ) , once brushed off a proposal for fancy new uniforms with a terse : " You look mighty silly when you lose in a trick getup . " <P> Necessity was the mother of his gridiron inventiveness . Because Tech 's academic standards were high , his squads correspondingly small , onetime Mathematics Professor William Anderson Alexander devised an intricate type of play that few but his apt engineers could have mastered . Ruddy-faced Coach Alex carried his chalk and blackboard to the half-time dressing rooms , substituted diagraming for tear-jerking pep talks . He said rousing up the boys produced mental instability . <P> During his quarter-century reign , the rambling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tied eight , played in five Bowl games , and piled up enough anecdotes to liven the Alex legend for years to come . Sample stories : <P> A star player got a front tooth kicked out in the last quarter of a tight game . The nerve was exposed and quivering , but the player begged Alex to keep him in the game . Alex finally gave in , took a wad of chewing gum from his own mouth and plastered the jumping nerve . The player finished the game , with third-stringers furiously chewing gum on the sidelines , at Alex 's order , to keep the star supplied with packing . <P> One season , when Tech had a particularly strong eleven , the schedule included a game with Clemson , a weak sister that year . The Atlanta gamblers spotted Clemson 35 points . Alex heard about it , played the entire game with his B team , and eked out a 7-to-0 victory . The gamblers lost their shirts , but none of their respect for Coach Alex .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
