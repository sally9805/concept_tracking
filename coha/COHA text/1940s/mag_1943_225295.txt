London had got two new Noel Coward plays last week , with Coward starring in both of them . If the audiences hoped for something with the drama of Coward 's cinema tribute to the Royal Navy , In Which We Serve ( TIME , Dec. 28 ) , they were disappointed . Present Laughter is another of Coward 's smooth , neatly frapped cocktails , and This Happy Breed is a wholesome and slightly doughy shepherd 's pie . <P> Present Laughter spins with the dalliances and divorces of a group of theater folk . They , like the play , are dominated by Garry Essendine ( Coward ) , a charming , exhibitionistic , highly temperamental actor first glimpsed in a flame-colored dressing gown and lemon-yellow pajamas . <P> The play - with its repeated slamming of bedroom doors - guys bedroom farce , and a very plain , very sane woman secretary points up the looniness of the artistic temperament . <P> This Happy Breed , a cavalcade of lower middle class life in a London suburb between two wars , is an attempted salute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it tells the sometimes drab story of the durable Gibbons family , their births , marriages , deaths , their small joys and fair-sized sorrows . Rich in accurate observation , and at moments funny , it is lean on drama and lacking in depth . No British Chekhov or even Odets , Coward has the wish to be a serious dramatist without the wherewithal . A born sophisticate , he is at ease on figure skates , but slightly awkward in the average man 's shoes .
