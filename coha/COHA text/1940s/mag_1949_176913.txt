Last week Nation 's Heritage , the newest , heaviest ( more than six pounds ) , and most expensive ( $30 a copy ) " magazine " on the market , was unwrapped in Manhattan . It was like an art annual , a camera history , and a college yearbook all rolled into one . <P> Across the front and back covers was a Grant Wood painting ( Stone City ) , printed in eight colors on linen . Inside were reproductions , many in fine color , of 389 other photographs , paintings , etchings and woodcuts . They covered everything from Thomas Edison to the oil industry , from Yankee clippers to undergraduate life at Princeton . There were no ads , no " think pieces " ; there was a bare minimum of text . Explained 30-year-old Editor Robert K. Heimann : " In thumbing through other magazines I 've often found myself skipping-the solid reading matter . . . " What text there was in Heritage could be skipped also . Example : " A nation 's heritage is its people-'the fellers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a train . . . " <P> Heritage had a press run of only 5,000 . But 29-year-old Publisher Malcolm Forbes , son of Publisher B. C. Forbes , hoped that his bimonthly magazine would be " visited " by thousands more , at schools , libraries and in reception rooms .
