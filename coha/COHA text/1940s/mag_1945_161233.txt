U.S. farmers and gardeners are better armed than ever before for this year 's battles against their prime enemies-insects and weeds . Against insects , the wonder insecticide DDT is scheduled for large-scale Government tests and a limited amount will be available for civilian experiments this year . Against weeds , the No. 1 enemy , which cost farmers as much ( $3,000,000,000 ) as all other pests combined , the prospects are even brighter . Some promising weapons : A flamethrower . Used mainly on cotton , sugar cane and corn plantations , this tractor-drawn implement spurts a 2,200 flame along the ground between rows , burns off weeds without harming the stouter stalks of crop plants , costs only one-tenth as much as hoeing .

Ammonium sulfamate . This new chemical , recently put on the market by Du Pont , has been so successful against poison ivy that enthusiasts predict the complete eradication of that noxious weed from the U.S. <P> 2-4-D . Last week news of a sensational new weed killer which may eclipse all these was spreading rapidly among U.S. farmers and suburbanites .

It is also deadly to poison ivy , poison oak , sumac , horse nettle , chickweed , thistles , plaintain , dandelions , ragweed . But it is harmless to animals , is not inflammable , does not corrode sprayers or reduce the fertility of the soil .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
