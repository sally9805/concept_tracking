Perched on the edge of his chair , the man at the piano glanced nervously about the orchestra , as if sure that something was about to go wrong . Robert Casadesus has played 100 times in Manhattan . But last week he had a special worry on his mind . This was the first time the New York Philharmonic-Symphony Orchestra had ever played one of his own pieces . Only when white-maned Conductor Leopold Stokowski got the orchestra safely through the opening bars did Composer Casadesus turn back to the keyboard and seem to relax , as he gave Manhattan its first hearing of his third Concerto for Piano and Orchestra . <P> Like Fellow Pianist Artur Schnabel and many another performer , Robert Casadesus has an itch to prove to the world that he can write as well as read music . " Since 15 , " says he , " I am composing all the time . Everywhere-on trains , airplanes , boats . " He has written three symphonies , three concertos and about 35 other compositions . The new piano concerto , 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Berkshires , and has already been played by Casadesus in Minneapolis and St. Louis . <P> " My music , " says Casadesus , " is clean music . It is classical , like Mozart . Mozart is my god . " His concerto was indeed clean : sharp and clear as good glass , with only patches of dissonance and agreeable smatterings of syncopation . Composer Casadesus still had some distance to go , however , before he would be on the same plane with his god . <P> The Carnegie Hall audience greeted the piano concerto warmly . But bowing and beaming , Composer Casadesus had more on his mind than the applause . He had a half-finished cello concerto waiting for him at home . Said he backstage : " I know I will compose tonight . I never rest . I am always in the fire . "
