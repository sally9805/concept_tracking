The meaning of the Cassino Monastery Incident was 80 miles north in Rome . Must the Allies bomb St. Peter 's into rubble and then fight their way , chapel by chapel , through the Vatican ? <P> In the valley below Mt . Cassino an American artillery-battery commander spoke : " I do n't give a damn about the monastery . I have Catholic gunners in this battery and they 've asked me for permission to fire on it , but I have n't been able to give it to them . They do n't like it . " <P> The Germans were using the famed 1,400-year-old Benedictine abbey as an artillery-observation post . This seemed well established , as hundreds of young Americans died on the slope below . Collier 's War Correspondent Frank Gevasi reported : " I saw 800 Americans go out and 24 come back , because the Germans could see every move and turn their fire on them . " And the Germans , after noting heavy , bloody U.S. losses , laconically reported in a communiqu that Indian Gurkha troops had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew too great . After weeks of soul searching and delay , the Allies decided to bomb and to shell the abbey . They followed a Dec. 29 , 1943 order of General Dwight Eisenhower : " We are fighting in a country . . . rich in monuments which illustrate the growth of the civilization which is ours . We are bound to respect those monuments so far as war allows . If we have to choose between destroying a famous building and sacrificing our own men , then our men 's lives count infinitely more , and the buildings must go . " <P> On a sunlit morning last week the buildings went . <P> " That 's Beautiful . " In the Liri Valley , thousands of U.S. soldiers , whose buddies had died on the slope , watched . Then , at 9:28 a.m. , from beyond the snow-capped peaks , came the first wave of lordly Fortresses . From the mountain peak came great orange bursts of flame , billowing smoke . The muffled crunch of explosions grew like a roll of thunder . <P> Three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9:45 . Watching the precision bombing , a U.S. general cried : " That 's beautiful . " He seemed to want to direct the planes : " That 's the way . Keep them over to the left . Oh , oh , that one 's a little bit close . That 's better . Oh , that 's beautiful . " <P> The bombers came on , 226 of them , Fortresses , Liberators , Mitchells and Marauders , roaming the cloudless sky undisturbed , dropping their bombs with exquisite exactness . Between the waves of bombers the artillery Long ' Toms and 240-mm. howitzers pumped shells up the hill . The mountain seemed to jump and quiver , like a great bear twitching in sleep . Observers counted 200 men , some allegedly in uniform , scurrying out of the devastated monastery . As the next-to-last wave of 20 Marauders dropped a cluster smack on the abbey , an American soldier yelled : " Touchdown . " <P> Thus the great Benedictine abbey , built 400 years ago on ground where Benedictine abbeys had stood for 1,400 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the next day Marauders swooped over to pick these ribs .
