txt Thanksgiving turkeys this year are only half what they used to be . That 's because they are twice as biz . raradoxical as this may sound , it 's what the meat markets would have us believe . However , One may be thankful that , along with the half-turkeys they 're featuring , they tactfully refrain from mentioning any other half-way measures with respect to items for the Thanksgiving menu . Seems there 's an over-supply of big turkeys this year . Which is far different from the situation a year ago when turkeys of any size were . almost in the class of the dodo . The big , birds were raised to fill Government orders for the armed forces . But , the war is over , and the big birds are now finding their way into retail stores . " Half a turkey is better than none , " they tell us . And then they go on to say how xnuch more meat one gets for less money . For example , a 12-pound whole turkey , at . the current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The bird will weigh a little less than 10 pounds after being cleaned . , On the - other hand , a half-turkey , weighing 10 pounds ( all drawn and ready to cook ) costs 55 cents a pound , or $5.50 . " There 's more meat on a drawn half-turkey weighing 10 pounds than there is on a whole turkey weighing 12 pounds , " the ads tell , us . Plenty of prime turkeys were available in Greater Boston markets today , and buying was reported as very brisk . But , most of the birds were of the larger sizes . There were definitely not enough of the small or medium-sized turkeys to meet all demands . All of which seems to bring us back to a choice between a large bird  --  or half a bird .

And , while we 're on the subject of wishing , what about a " wish bone " that 's already wished upon as the butcher split the turkey ? ? Give a youngster a drumstick , and he 's all set . Give tWio of them the whole wishbone , and you have table conversation for the best of families . But , with one lone drumstick , one lone wing , and half a wishbone  --  well , there 's only one consolation  --  no neck at all may be infinitely better than half a neck . These and many more considerations flit through one 's thoughts as the purchase of a whole or half-turkey is contemplated . There 's also the problem of the generous , " **33;212;TOOLONG " buyer who throws caution to the winds and settles for a plump 22-pounderonly to find that , by no manner of squeezing , can ' it be fitted into the biggest roasting pan on hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having decided  --  or having it decided for us  --  that a half-turkey in the oven is better than a whole turkey in the butcher 's showcase , here 's how the Poultry and Egg National Board , of Chicago , recommends that it should be prepared and roasted : The First Step Step .
