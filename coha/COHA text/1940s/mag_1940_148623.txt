As everybody had expected , Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King 's Liberal Party won last week 's Dominion election hands down . But nobody had expected such a rout as Mackenzie King 's enemies suffered . Conservative Leader Robert J. Manion lost his seat , was expected soon to lose his leadership . In Ontario , where blustery Premier Mitchell Hepburn had precipitated the election by knifing his leader in the back ( TIME , Feb. 5 ) , the Liberals won 55 seats against 25 for the Conservatives , and Mitch was so discredited that his retirement seemed also in order . Quebec returned Minister of Justice Ernest Lapointe in triumph , defeated all the lieutenants of disgruntled ex-Premier Maurice Duplessis who backed Conservative candidates . <P> In the new House of Commons Liberals will have 176 out of 245 seats . Even the Senate , which has a 51-45 Conservative majority , will soon become Liberal , since Prime Minister Mackenzie King is assured of five more years in power and members are appointed for life . The Senate has been Conservative since the days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who served for 20 years ( 1867-74 , 1878-91 ) . <P> If 65-year-old Mackenzie King serves out his term , he will have been Prime Minister for 19 years , not quite so long as Sir John Macdonald but five years longer than the late great Liberal leader , Sir Wilfred Laurier , whose protege he was . <P> Sir Wilfred Laurier began to watch William Lyon Mackenzie King as early as 1900 , when he learned that the young man had entered the civil service ( as Deputy Minister of Labor ) in preparation for a public career . Up to that time Mackenzie King had been headed for social service . After graduating from the University of Toronto and Harvard he had studied social conditions in Europe , done social work under Jane Addams at Chicago 's Hull House . But his grandfather had led an abortive rebellion against the British in upper Canada , and Sir Wilfred thought the grandson had the stuff of a leader in him . He made him Minister of Labor in 1909 . From 1911 , when the Conservatives came in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King was his faithful lieutenant . Two years later the Liberals were back in the saddle , and Liberal Leader Mackenzie King became Prime Minister . Since then he has been out once , in since 1935 . <P> Poetry-loving Bachelor Mackenzie King spends so much time at his country house , " Kingsmere , " that Mitch Hepburn dubbed him " The Hermit of Kingsmere . " In win-ter he lives at " Laurier House " in Ottawa , which Sir Wilfred left to the Liberal Party . A Gladstonian Liberal , the red-faced Prime Minister once investigated industrial relations for the Rockefeller Institute , worked out a plan of employer-employe representation that was put into practice by Colorado Fuel &; Iron Co. , Bethlehem Steel Co. and others . He is just the sort of " safe " Liberal that Canadians could trust to see them through the war without grabbing too much power , and last week he was at work on Canada 's first billion-dollar budget to pay for it .                 @ @ @ @
