FATIGUE A Story CHRISTOPHER LA FARGE This is the fourth story in Mr. La Farge 's series , " East by Southwest . " The others appeared in our August and September numbers. ? The Editors y ou must understand that this partic- ular evening was not a peculiarity , but was like many others on that South Pacific island . Otherwise I should not write of it . I must tell you too that I was somewhat weary when I arrived at the Officers ' Club at Tou6bon , where all this began . I had gone far up the island of Balade to Poumbea , driven by an Engineer officer to his supply depot , where I was able to pick up a jeep for my own use for a week  --  and jeeps were invaluable and not easily come by . Then , in the heat and the glare , I had driven the jeep back to Touebon , down the narrowly winding , mountainous , sharply crowned road , in a steady stream of fast traffic of big trucks that kicked up thick dust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembering all the way the comment of the Engineer as he had pointed to a large new cemetery on the side of a high hill . " That , " he had said , " is composed ninety per cent of truck drivers . " Sometimes a jeep can seem even smaller than it is . I mention all this because one 's views and responses are so sharply colored by fatigue . Nevertheless I do not believe that my own weariness could whollyaccount for the feeling I had when I saw Lester Purdey at the Club . It was not shock , for I had long got over being shocked , and it was not concern , because I knew him too slightly . It was perhaps more a sense of loss , of the sort one feels when , revisiting a meadow once peaceful and admired , one finds it scarred by a new development . I had seen Purdey a month before . He is about twenty-two years old , a lieutenant , the skipper of a PT boat . He was just back from New Zealand then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face was fresh-looking , without lines , and his heavy tan did not hide the young color in his cheeks . We had spent a pleasant and a peaceful evening together , talking of music and of hooks , of New Zealand and so , necessarily , of fishing for the magnificent trout there . I remember that his conversation was remarkably free from profanity . He was intelligent and had more education than most of the other Texans I had met . Finally we had talked of the war and he had told me a little of the job of the PT boats . It was a calm and objective account : he had laid aside his duties from him for the time being , for he was rested , and he could see the picture whole . He was an example to me then of how gentle a young man can be and still preserve the full toughness of his fiber . He did n't wear the ribbon of the Navy Cross ( for no one wore ribbons there ) but he had it to wear . The bar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a quarter past six  --  with about three hundred officers . They were from all branches of the services , they were young and middle-aged , and they included some New Zealanders and some Frenchmen , and a few very heavily escorted Nurses , whose degree of beauty in form and figure was various but whose power of attraction was an indisputable absolute . It took me some time to buy myself a bottle of beer , and then I wandered away from the bar and started looking round for Captain Sam Cheston , a Cavalry officer with whom I had agreed to dine . It was while I was looking for Cheston that I spotted Lester Purdey . He was one of a group of four Navy men gathered about one of the slot machines . He was clutching a dozen quarters in the same hand that held a bottle of beer by the neck , and with the other hand he was operating the machine . His face was more deeply tanned than before , but under the tan was a gray that was clearly evident , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . He seemed taller than I remembered him until I realized that he had lost weight , and he had some lines in his face  --  between his eyes , and running down from his nostrils  --  that did not belong with his age . So different indeed was this from the man I remembered that I approached him a little tentatively , wondering if I were mistaking someone else for him . " Hi , Purdey , " I said . " When did you get in ? " He looked round at me , rather the way someone looks at you when you interrupt him with a girl , but then he smiled and said hello and called me by name . He turned back immediately to his machine , put in another quarter , and gave the handle a hard pull . Without taking his eyes off the revolving symbols , he said , " I got in to-day . How 're things with you ? God damn ! " The symbols backof their little glass window had clicked to a stop with two lemons showing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I asked . " She gave once , " he said . " I 'll just make the son of a bitch give once more and then I 'll quit . " He pulled the handle viciously and the symbols whirled round . " Want to eat with me and some other guys ? " " Where ? " he said . " La Rotonde , " I said . " There 'll be no food here , with this mob , unless you stand in line now . " " No , " he said . " And no time to drink . Hell ! " The machine registered another miss and he put in another quarter . " O.K. What time ? " " We 've reserved the table for seven-thirty , " I said . " O.K. , " he said . " Double bloody hell ! " The machine showed a lemon again as it stopped . At once he put in another quarter . " You 'll lose every cent you 've won , " I said . " It 's all velvet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . " He gave the handle a gentle pull . " What in hell is the use of money here ? " He finished the bottle of beer and set it on the floor . As he did so the symbols came , one by one , to their clicking stop , a line of three blue plums ; the machine gave a bell-like note that made every head in the neighborhood turn , and a cascade of quarters noisily filled the metal trough at the base . " Hot damn ! " said Purdey . He scooped out the quarters and put them , without counting , into his trousers pockets . At that precise moment one of the ten bartenders behind the long , L-shaped bar rang a ship 's bell . " Aaah ! " said the three hundred officers and Nurses within the barroom , and " Aaah ! " echoed from the two hundred more officers who had been seated in the shady garden outside . It was the signal for the beginning of hard-liquor sales . Purdey and I immediately moved toward the bar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whisky , for the customers were three deep at the rail already . When we finally succeeded we had great difficulty in getting away from there ( which was the accepted and sensible rule ) because of the influx of men from the garden , most of whom were hurriedly finishing their bottles of beer . The noise was terrific , for they all talked a whole tone louder than before , and as the floor of the room was paved in red tiles , the sound echoed and echoed again . When we were clear of the worst of the crush I spoke to him . " Let 's go outside , " I said . " It 's quieter . " " Hell , no , " Purdey said . " I love it . And that 's too far away from the bar . " He was gulping his drink . " All right , " I said . Then I remembered something I wanted to find out from him . " What happened to the victrola and those records ? " He looked past me , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " The ones Roddy Black gave you when he went home , the lucky stiff . " " The hell with that stuff , " he said . " That 's all a lot of crap . " It was so rude that it did n't seem so  --  he was n't aiming it at me . " Want another drink ? " " Not yet , " I said . " In time . " " Time ? " he said . " you never know about time . Time can run out . So can liquor . " . He started to edge toward the bar . " I 've got to find Sam Cheston , " I said . " I 'll pick you up then and we 'll eat . " " O.K. , " he said , but he was n't paying me any attention . He was busy edging in to the bar . As he did so he bumped a man he knew and the man turned . They greeted each other noisily and lie and Purdey worked toward the bar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a feeling that I was intruding . It was an odd sensation with a man like Purdey . I made my way down the room looking for Cheston . About half way down I ran into Colonel Ike Masters of the Intelligence , a tall , wiry man with a pleasant smile . " Hello , " he said . " I hear you 've got your orders for the A3 to-morrow . " The A3 is a cruiser , and it was true I had my orders for her . " News travels fast here , " I said . " Sure does , " he said . " Her executive officer is here , Commander Burrows . I thought you might like to meet him . He 's as nice as they come . " " Thank you , " I said . " I 've seen him but I have n't been introduced . " " Come along , " he said and he turned and starred for the outer wall of the room , where the slot machines arc . He had hardly taken five steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of whom I 'd met long before , though I 'd forgotten his name . He was a lieutenant commander . " For Gaaad 's sake ! " he cried . " Look who 's here ! " " You must have got in to-day with all the rest of this howling mob , " I said . " You 're God-damned tootin ' right , " he said . " And boy ! are we glad to get here ! I want you to meet the greatest guy in the U. S. Navy , the captain of the old Carlyle , the best damn transport vessel in the whole damn Pacific , even if she ai n't what she used to be , many long years ago . " He began to sing . " Many long years ago , many long years ago . . . " . The man with him , a commander , a short , stocky , red-faced , clever-looking man , joined in . So did Colonel Masters and I. So did several other men near us . " The old gray ship , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sang the Lieutenant Commander and the rest of us , until we had come to the end of the chorus . As it ended , and without a pause , the Lieutenant Commander said , " Many long years ago . This is Commander Elihu Fry , the best God-damned skipper in the whole world . " " How do you do , Captain ? " I said . " How do you do ? " said Commander Fry coldly , and we shook hands . Fry stood and looked at me . He held a glass of whisky in each hand . From time to time he would take a drink from one of them and , immediately after , drink from the other . He swayed hack and forth on his feet , like a comedy cop except that he did n't bend his knees . It was a perfectly controlled movement . " So you wanted to meet me ? " he said . " Very much , " . I said , as that seemed indicated . " And of course you 'll be wanting to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly , but I said , " Yes of course . " " Everyone knows about the Carlyle , " he said . " Everyone wants to come aboard . By God , we can give you a meal that ca n't be beat this side of La Rue 's in Paris . Mr. Carnally here , " he said , moving his head toward the Lieutenant Commander , " can show you over the whole ship . See her work . Watch her unload . Lunch to-morrow . Twelve o'clock at the naval landing and ask for the Carlyle 's barge . Twelve o'clock . Sharp . " He took two drinks , one from each glass . " Want to come ? " he said to Colonel Masters . " Of course he wants to come , " said Carnally . " Sure I do , " said the Colonel . " But I ca n't . Is n't that hell ? " " That 's damn tough luck , " said Carnally . " Another time , " said Fry . " Twelve o'clock , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spain . And Portugal . Persia . " " That 'll be fine , " I said , not having the faintest idea what he was talking about . " I 'll be prompt . " " We 're off , " said Fry to Carnally . " Get that God-damned Marine , and we 're off . " " Right , " said Carnally . " Twelve o'clock . I knew you 'd be lucky if I introduced you to the captain . " He turned and made his way toward the bar . Fry rocked back and forth on his feet , his eyes tight shut . The interview seemed to be over . " Come along , " said the Colonel . We edged past Commander Fry , and again made our way toward the outside wall . " Who in hell is he ? " I asked . " Him ? " said the Colonel . " Boy , that Carlyle has been through more stuff than any transport in the whole Pacific . Battle of Savo . She 's got seven Jap planes to her credit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You 'll hear a lot tomorrow . Now he 's  --  well  --  he 's just ashore . I really do wish I could have gone with you . " Nettle and Zipper are the code names of islands north of Balade , nearer the equator  --  and the Japs . Almost no onegives them their right names . People who took transports there could have plenty to tell you  --  if they were sober . " Is he drunk ? " I asked the Colonel . " Good God , no , " said Masters . " He 's just got in . He 's been out here over a year . " " Oh , " I said . He was trying to tell me something , but I did n't understand what it was till much later . By this time we had reached the wall and we turned along it till we came to the fourth slot machine . Leaning against it , an empty glass in his right hand , was Commander Burrows . I had plenty of time to look him over before we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin . He had a young face with sharp lines in it , and his thick hair was almost entirely white . He had dark circles under his eyes . His mouth hung a little open , like that of a man with a cold in his nose , and his lips were pale . He was rapidly smoking a cigarette in a long black holder , and the thin , well-shaped fingers of his left hand were stained in spite of the holder with the deep yellow of nicotine . Colonel Masters introduced me to him . " How do you do ? " he said . " I understand you 're coining aboard . We only got in to-day . We shall be in port for a few days . You 'd better come aboard in time for supper to-morrow night . Get aboard by five-thirty . We have a new movie . " Between each sentence he took a pull at his cigarette . In spite of his words his manner of speech was cultivated . " There will be much to tell you , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll come out at five-thirty . " I waited . It would not then have surprised me if he had added , " I 'll tell you all about India and the Galapagos Islands . " There was something astonishing in the manner of all these men to-night . " Have you met the captain ? " he asked . " Not yet . I 'm looking forward to it . " " He 'd tell you just what I 'm going to , " he said . " You might as well understand it . " He moved his shoulders , like a man assuming a heavy weight . " Do n't try to tell us how to win the war . " " Oh , " I said . " No . " " No , " he said . " These people fresh with a fine skipper . A mag- : Erie ship , crew . We do n't need people to ten us how to win the war . Wholly unThere 's enough trouble at necessary , home , strikes , Lewis , isolationism , discord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those , that they can come out here and tell us what to do . " He edged the butt out of the holder with his thumbnail and put in a new cigarette . I struck a match and he lit his cigarette at it " Thank you , " he said . Then suddenly he smiled at me , an altogether young and charming smile . " You 'll be most welcome aboard , " he said . Then in his previous manner and with great firmness , he added , " Good night . " " Good night , " I said . " Thank you for the advice , Commander . " Then I turned to leave him , as I had so obviously again been dismissed . Colonel Masters had disappeared . I found Sam Cheston and together we looked everywhere for Lester Purdey , but we could n't find him . It was almost eight o'clock and we were afraid we 'd lose our table , so we set off for La Rotonde without him . If in your experience the name of La Rotonde has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one at Touebon . It creates no nostalgia . One enters it by a narrow , smelly , black little alley , past a dreary room with dark-red walls that is called , magnificently , the Private Dining Room . Then one turns into a broader hall , and goes down three steps into the main dining room . It has dirty brown walls , a high ceiling of patterned tin , also brown , a couple of chandeliers fitted with naked and glaring electric bulbs . The floor is wooden and unswept . We found our table for four , and the other two we had expected , a New Zealander and a Frenchman , were already there and had ordered wine . Ordering Wine means that you have a long argument with a Kanaka , in pidgin French , and that he finally brings you an unlabeled bottle of extraordinary cm ordinafre , which is just drinkable and does n't give you dysentery like the water . The Tanaka wears trousers and an armless , once-white undershirt , walks barefooted with a surly dignity and an upright carriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ halfway up his skull and the rest of the unclipped bush is bleached to a henna color . One school of thought proclaims that this bleaching means he is in love , but another suspects a basic desire to eliminate lice . The food is edible but that 's all . You get soup , an unidentified fish and an unidentifiable meat and a green vegetable and potatoes and an inedible dessert and black coffee with chicory in it , which is excellent if you like chicory . However , it is all better as a meal than a cold Spam sandwich at the Club , or the malted milk and piece of pie that is all you can get in the shops . If you are not too late at La Rotonde the food is hot . We were having a pleasant time at dinner . The Frenchman and Sam Cheston got going on local gossip and were being extremely funny , and we had all had enough to drink to laugh a lot . The New Zealander was ( like most of his kind ) as nice as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carnally suddenly came into the room and to our table . " By God ! " he said to me , " there you are . By God , I been looking high and low for you . Come along . " " Sit down , " I said . " No , " he said . " Hell no , gents . He wants you . Come along . " " Who wants me ? " " The skipper , " he said . " The old man . Fry wants you . By God , I been looking everywhere for you . " I could n't imagine either where he 'd looked in this little place or what Commander Fry wanted of me , but I got up and followed him . He fed the way back to the Private Dining Room and entered it . " Here he is , Captain , " he said . " By God , I found him . " Commander Fry was sitting in a large wicker rocking chair , two glasses of whisky in his hands , both eyes shut . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dark-haired little Frenchwoman , no longer in her first youth , though she must once have been pretty . In a far corner there was a gramophone going , playing old and badly scratched French records , and it was tended by a Marine captain . I could n't see his face , for his back was to the room , but I saw his huge ears which stuck out at right angles to his closely clipped head . On a round table were coffee cups and empty plates and the remains of dinner , and one bottle of Scotch whisky , three-quarters full . As I entered no one moved . " I got him , " repeated Carnally , very loudly . " Here he is . " Commander Fry opened his eyes and looked at me . Then he sprang to his feet , put both glasses on the table . " Sit down , sit down , " he said . " Get a chair , Carnally . Make yourself at home . " Carnally touched a chair at the table , and I sat down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frenchwoman remained motionless and so did the Marine captain . For almost a full minute we sat there saying nothing . Then the record ended , and the Marine at once put on another . " Here , here , " said Fry . " For heaven 's sake , Carnally , give the gentleman a drink . " I started to protest , seeing they had only the one bottle for four of them ( if the Frenchwoman drank ) , but Fry brushed my protest aside , saying , " Nonsense , nonsense , " and he rose again himself and went to the side table and got a tall glass and put ice in it from a glass bowl . Carnally poured me a stiff drink . Then he made one for himself and refilled both the Commander 's glasses and put in fresh ice and water . Then they sat down again . " Thanks , " I said . " Here 's how . " " How , " they said together . " Glad to have you aboard , " said Fry . He took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . The only sound was the raucous noise of the gramophone emitting a stream of almost indistinguishable French words . I am not sure how long this silence lasted  --  perhaps two minutes , for the record was still playing when Commander Fry spoke . " Castleton , " he said in a loud voice . " Wake up , man ! Wake up ! Here he is . " The Marine turned his head and looked at Fry . " Here he is , " Fry repeated and poi ? to me . " What are you waiting foo , ? Ited " Oh , " said Captain Castleton , Ile rose and came over to us . I could see that he was a very good-looking man now nose ' ( except for those ears ) , with a long and handsome mouth altogether distorted into an expression of suffering that persisted even when he smiled . " Come on " he e said to me . " We 've been waiting for you , " " Twelve o'clock , sharp , " said Fry , I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my time , but never quite like this nor in such circumstances . I looked at Carnally . He was sitting with his glass in his hand , gazing out the window that gave on the black little alley . The Frenchwoman rose and went over to the gramo. phone , which had run down . Com . mander Fry sat with his eyes closed , hold . ing his two drinks . " Come along , " Castleton said , and he splashed some whisky into a glass and turned at once and left the room . All I could do was follow him . He lcd me up some narrow stairs and into a totally dark room . After some fumbling he found the switch and turned on the ugly electric chandelier . As he did so a Kanaka suddenly materialized . He was younger than the one in the dining room but otherwise similar . " Non , non ! " said Castleton . " Allen . Non . Rien . " The Kanaka looked at us and then disappeared . " Sit here , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baize card table and we sat down . " So you want to know about the Artillery , " he said . It was so unexpected that I laughed . Then , collecting myself , I said , " Why , yes . At least , I 'm always interested . " " What ? " said Castleton . " I 'm deaf in my left ear . Gunfire . " He turned his head half round , presenting his right ear to me . It was a trick he did each time I spoke and , though reasonable , was disconcerting . " Yes , " I said , raising my voice . " I 'd like to hear about the Artillery . " " On Guadalcanal , " he said , " it was the same as it is everywhere . The function of the Artillery is to support the Infantry . You never want to forget that . " " No , " I said . " On Guadalcanal , " he said , " we had no surveys . So we had to do it by guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surveys ? " I asked . " The men just went forward and observed , " he said . " Sometimes behind a Iog , sometimes up a tree . It made no difference , for we had our job to do and you just do it the best you can . You just remember always that the job of the Artillery is to support the Infantry , and you 're all right . " The Kanaka came into the room . " Lumiere , " he said , pointing to the chandelier . " Non . Non lumiere . " " Non , " said Castleton . " Get out . Allez . Dans une minute , nous sommes finis . Non . " He waved violently , and the Kanaka went away . " I never got through college , " he said . " But I was lucky . I studied under Professor O'Reilly at California . He was a wonderful man on mathematics . I 'll never forget him . Did you ever know O'Reilly ? Have you been to Guadalcanal ? ' ' " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Artillery ? " he said . " Well , I 'm not really , " I said . " How did you get the idea I was ? " " We 'll get a rest here , " he said . " I 'd like to get home but I do n't see a chance of it . You get tired . " " Yes , " I said , " of course you do . " The Kanaka reappeared . " Lumiere , " he said . " Non . " " We 're going now , " said Castleton . " Nous allons . " He rose and offered his hand . " Good night , " he said . " It has been a very great pleasure talking to you . But just remember about the Artillery that its function is to support the Infantry , even if it has no surveys , and you 'll not make any bad mistakes . Good-by . I 'm a little late . " He shook me by the hand , his sad mouth twisted into an altogether terrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Lumiere ? " " Oui , " I said . " Douse it . " The Kanaka at once switched off the light and I went downstairs again . As I passed the Private Dining Room I couldsee Commander Fry in his rocking chair , Mr. Carnally on his chair at the table , the Frenchwoman sitting bolt upright beside Fry , and Captain Castleton at the gramophone , his good ear turned toward it . No one was speaking . Fry had his eyes tight shut , but he was not asleep because he took two drinks as I watched , one from each glass he held . The single bottle of whisky was now quite empty . I went into the big dining room . The New Zealander and the Frenchman had left . Lester Purdey was eating at my table , with Cheston . I joined them . " I came at last , " said Purdey . " Sorry to be so late . " " It 's O.K. , " I said . " I thought you would n't come . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The liquor wo n't touch you . " " Are you getting enough to eat ? " I asked him . " Sure , " he said . " I ca n't taste anything , but I guess it 's food . " " Look , pal , I 've got to go , " said Cheston . " Listen , will you run me down to the Club ? I 'm awfully late . " " Yes , " I said ; and to Purdey , " Will you wait here for me ? " " Sure , " he said . " Do something for me . I left my cigarette case back of the third slot machine . It 's green . It 's a good-luck case . You know ? Will you look for it and bring it back if you find it ? For God 's sake , find it will you ? " " I will , " I said . I drove Chcston to the Club and he picked up his own car there and left at once . I went inside . About @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more to drink . I found the case where Purdey had said it might be . It was made of a light-green plastic , of a shape to hold a pack of cigarettes , and on it in gold letters was stamped : Hollis Funeral Home Ambulance &; Hearse Telephone 2-1717 Hollis was Purdey 's home town in Texas . It was a fine good-luck token . As I left I passed near the fourth slot machine . Commander Burrows was standing there and , as far as I could see , had not moved . He held an empty glass in his right hand and he was smoking rapidly , as before . There was a young man talking to him . " Why not come outside and sit down , Commander ? " the young man said . Commander Burrows looked at him and then said , with great deliberation , " No . No . I think not . If you once sit down it is so difficult to get going again . Do n't you agree ? " I went right past them and out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Purdey had left the dining room . I looked for him upstairs , where there was a big crap game going , and in the little room ( still dark ) where Castleton of the Artillery had talked to me , and in the lavatory ( if you can call it that ) , and I asked the proprietress ; but I could not find him . So I left and walked uphill in the darkness to where I had parked my jeep . I got in and switched on the lights . Their beam fell on Purdey , who was sitting on the edge of the gutter , about fifteen yards farther along . I got out and went to him . He was crying softly . " Come along , pal , " I said . He stopped crying at once and he said , " I did n't know how in hell I 'd get home . No . Not home . But to the Navy camp . Thirteen . It 's so God-damned far . " " I 'll take you there right now , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He got up and we walked to the jeep and got in . We started the four-mile drive out to the camp . I did n't know what to say , so I shut up . After we had got out of town he spoke . " Those records , " he said . " Roddy Black 's . There were ten of them . All classical . Brahms , Bach , Debussy , Stravinsky , Beethoven . We played them tillthey plumb wore out . You get sick of jazz and boogie-woogie  --  as you get older . I do n't know what we 'd have done without them . Gone crazy . I thought you 'd like to know . " " Yes , " I said . " What did you like best ? " He did n't answer . He had gone to sleep sitting up . I drove to Camp Thirteen and I woke him up at the gate because I had no pass to go in . He got out and left me without a word . He walked straight enough , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guard at the gate looked closely at him , but he evidently recognized him , for he did n't stop him . He was through the gate when I saw his green case on the seat . I jumped out and ran to the guard . " Get the Lieutenant back , " I said . " He 's left this . It 's his lucky piece . " The guard ran after Purdey and touched his arm . I could n't hear what he said , but Purdey turned and walked back to me . " You left it again , " I said . He took it and looked at it , feeling it with his fingers . " Yes , " he said . " Thanks . It 's just we 're all so tired . " Then he turned again and walked away toward the huts . The guard looked at him and at me and shook his head . I drove back to my camp then and parked the jeep . I too was so tired by then that I wondered if I had the strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the dark to my tent . But I did it , knowing all the time that the fatigue I felt was of a different sort , that would all be cured by one night 's good sleep .
