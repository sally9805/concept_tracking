Bill Mauldin 's sardonic , unshaven Willie once summed up his attitude to the reckless flood of U.S. decorations in World War II . Said Willie : " Just gim me a coupla aspirin . I already got a Purple Heart . " <P> By war 's end most front-line troops agreed with Willie . They had their own jeering nicknames for the even cheaper noncombat awards . The Asiatic-Pacific Theater ribbon was the " malaria bar with atabrine clusters " ; the pre-Pearl Harbor service medal was the " Lend-Lease cross . " <P> It became an overseas gag that a WAC who had done nothing more than commute to &; from the Pentagon could hardly miss at least three awards : the American Theater Campaign Ribbon , the Victory Medal , the Good Conduct Ribbon . Totals ran so high that the wartime U.S. could not afford the metal to strike the medals themselves , issued ribbons instead . <P> But this week the War Department began to catch up with itself , and made an already ridiculous situation more ridiculous . It began issuing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Occupation Ribbons. * Distribution would run into the millions . <P> * One occupation medal last week went to Washington Newsman Nelson M. Shepard , 29 years late , for service with the Fifth Marines in World War I.
