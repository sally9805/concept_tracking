The U.S. is being sternly reminded this week-National Heart Week-that medicine is making little headway against public enemy No. i : heart disease . Though heart disease , as obituary columns remind readers every day , is now the biggest killer ( nearly 600,000 deaths a year ) , it gets scant research attention . Even more shocking , says the American Heart Association , is the nation 's neglect of the treatable disease known as rheumatic fever . <P> Rheumatic fever not only kills more U.S. children each year than almost all other diseases combined : it accounts for 40% of all heart trouble . <P> Launching . " the most comprehensive assault on heart disease ever waged by this country , " the A. H. A. is concentrating its heaviest publicity fire on rheumatic fever . Some facts : At least 1,000,000 U.S. citizens suffer from R.F. and its sequel , rheumatic heart disease . <P> Of those who get the disease , a fifth die within ten years , another fifth are crippled for life . <P> Though primarily a children 's disease ( ages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World War II . <P> Heart specialists have found rheumatic fever a complicated , baffling disease . Though it is usually preceded by a streptococcus infection ( e.g. , a " strep " throat , scarlet fever ) , researchers have not been able to establish the connection between the germ ( hemolytic streptococcus ) and R.F. It seems to thrive best in crowded slums , but it is not unusually prevalent among Negroes . It is chronically high in sparsely settled Colorado . <P> Rheumatic fever is hard to diagnose . Its symptoms-fever , aching joints ( " growing pains " ) , nosebleeds , loss of appetite and weight , twitching resembling St. Vitus ' dance-are easily confused with the symptoms of grippe and other ailments . Patients may recover from an attack without permanent damage , often without knowing they were really sick . But unless the patient gets skillful treatment , R.F. may . recur . <P> The most effective treatment is complete rest . But doctors frown on the old idea that an R.F. patient must be treated as a permanent invalid .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
