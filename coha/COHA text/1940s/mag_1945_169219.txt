The long , narrow spearhead that Marshal Georgi K. Zhukov had thrust toward Berlin broadened out . While Zhukov paused , Marshal Ivan S. Konev hammered into line on his left . The Red armies were linked along the east bank of the Oder , their flanks more secure . <P> Now spearheads on the west bank could reach farther . Konev columns snaked around Breslau , sealed off Silesia 's largest city , locked up its garrison . Red Army Tommy gunners broke into the town , began a grim house-to-house fight . <P> Another Konev column plunged nearer to Dresden . Still another surged up the Autobahn toward Berlin 's southern gates , in a drive aimed through the Cottbus rail center . Hard fighting raged inside the walled , medieval town of Guben , communications center 65 miles southeast of the Reich 's capital . Great clouds of smoke , rising from fires set by British and American airmen , beckoned them on . <P> Shaping Up . Still Zhukov hesitated before Berlin , waiting while the whole line assumed the same curving shape it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Along the Oder , Red Army engineers split boxlike German windmills to build barges for their tanks . <P> These Russians looked about them at Germany . Wrote one Red Army correspondent : " The sky is the same . The earth is the same . There are the same lakes and swamps all cut with dykes . But morally this place gives our men a huge , incomparable satisfaction understandable only to a Soviet man . " <P> Men wondered what had happened to the Germans . Here &; there they stabbed at the Red forces , everywhere they fought desperately to hold , but they had not struck out in a full-scale counterattack as they had done four historic times before to check Russian offensives . Surrounded in cities behind the Russian lines were an estimated 650,000 Germans . Perhaps the long drain on manpower was at last beginning to tell . The 50-day agony of Budapest , one of the surrounded strong points , came to an end . The guns fell silent and out of the rubble crawled the garrison , 110,000 dazed men . Red Army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Pfeffer-Wildenbruch , out of a sewer .
