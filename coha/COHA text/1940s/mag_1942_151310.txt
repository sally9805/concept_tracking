Intelligence from Africa , as reported by TIME 'S resident correspondent on the Gold Coast , Henry B. Cole : <P> " After this war , if I say ' Hello chappie , I 'm for the U.S.A. , ' do n't think I 'm referring to New York or do n't think my kit is packed for any other part of Uncle Sam 's domain . <P> " By Golly , no ! You 'd better ask me what I mean . Then I 'll tell you I refer to the United States of Africa . Well , do n't knock your head off . It 's not my idea , anyway . It 's General Smuts 's . <P> " Addressing forces of the Union of South Africa recently , whilst on a tour in the East , General Smuts told the men that they were building ' a greater South Africa which will ultimately stand foremost in a U.S. of Africa . ' <P> " Has the pattern been made clear ? Sure . It 's by no means fanciful . The spectacle is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but also at local and regional collaboration . . . . It would also provide a model for the rest of the world in the difficult days of post-war reconstruction-if and only if South Africans accept the Rooseveltian slogan of ' no color bar . ' * <P> " The transformation of a Union of South Africa into a U.S. of Africa is a task which General Smuts is capable of undertaking with a view to give Europe a lesson . " <P> * A possible political power in a new U.S.A. would be Chief Nana Kojo Agyeaman of the Brongs . Impatient with Vichy 's failure to resist Germany , he recently led his tribe from the French Ivory Coast to British Ashanti adjoining the Gold Coast . As they marched , the Brongs chanted a traditional song : <P> I have come from a very far country <P> I have been living on cassava <P> Now I see yams <P> I thank you all .
