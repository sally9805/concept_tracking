you hear a lot about woman 's hair . It 's one of her favorite topics , and at the hairdresser 's she collectively spends an annual $250 , - 000,000 slice of her husband 's salary . Magazines , newspapers , and newsreels show its current styles and forecast its future . It 's an open book to her husband , who feels free to criticize her current coiffure or deflate her domestic dignity by deriding her hair curlers at the breakfast table . But what about man and his hair ? Do you ever hear anything about the Male Coiffure ? Is it ever the subject of style showings ? let alone home discussion ? Does it draw admiration , approval , or even attention from woman ? Not so far . Woman does n't seem to realize there is such a thing , and about the only times she notices her husband 's crowning glory are when : he needs a new haircut , he 's just had one . There 's a lot more to the Male Coiffure than that . And it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The first fundamental to know is : Male coiffures fall into two groups ? those man wears from choice when he 's young and those he wears from necessity when he 's older . The former , which he nev ? er seems to want to change , could be more original . The latter , which he ca n't change much even if he should want to , are the best he can do with the hair he has . Or has not . For the lowdown on how man does his hair , take a look around these pages . On a clear day with good visibility most of the hairdos  | shown are easily discernible to the naked eye . See how many you can spot the next time you 're out . But do n't stare , for man 's hair is not meant to be conspicuous . Actually , man has about as many current coiffures as woman . The thing is , you just do n't notice them because they 've been current for so long . What 's more , it looks as though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come . Most men wear the same basic hairdo they 've worn all their lives and would n't dream of any drastic change , because they 've finally got it down to an irreducible minimum of effort . Just look at this simple setup and you 'll see why man 's styles are so static : He spends only a scant minute a day arranging his hair , seldom brushes it , never has to fuss with anything like pins and curlers , shampoos his hair right along with his shower , goes to the barbershop for 20 minutes every couple of weeks or so , and the drab reasons he gives for having his hair cut are simply comfort , neatness . And what do you think is man 's idea of a really good haircut ? One that does n't look.as though he 'd had a haircut at all ! A good male haircut , it seems , should be a secret that no one 's in on except man and his barber . Which is why , as soon as he sits down in the barber chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy ? not too short ! " Then , instead of directing the barber in detail , to be sure it 's going to be exactly the way he wants it , he settles down to wonder about baseball , wish  | he were playing golf , ask about a horse , or complain about politics . Imagine ! Of course , some men are less particular and some are more particular about them hairdos ? just as they are about shaver or shoeshines or anything else . For in - stance , the most lax are artists , musician ; and Senators , because they think they look more impressive shaggy . And tramps , because they ca n't afford to look any other way . The most fussy ? because they 're sticklers for looking neat ? art physicians , salesmen , brokers , urban New Englanders , and Jimmy Walker . You 'd think offhand that man would get tired of wearing the same old hair style year in and year out , and when he 's at the barber 's he 'd at least take advantage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ styles ? as his wife does at the hairdresser 's . But he does n't . Man usually goes to the barbershop during his lunch hour or on his way home front work . At both times he 's hungry and just does n't feel experimental If you should challenge your husband on how he could change the style of his hair , the chances are he 'd say he could change the part , which is probably on the left . This is pretty radical . But even this has its limitations , for there are only a few ways he could do it . He could have a center part , a half-part a little lower , a three-quarter part lower still , or no part at all , like Clifton Fadiman . Later on in life , the part in man 's hair gets to be like the hand of a clock and tells how much older he 's getting . Here 's how it works : The top of his head starts poking through his hair . So he moves the part lower and lower , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then , when the part gets as low as it can without dissecting his ear ? say about 3 o'clock ? and even the camouflage hair begins to wane , man adopts as a last resort what 's technically known as the " sardine " or " shoestring " arrangement . Every sparse hair is geometrically and systematically plastered across his pate where it will do the best concealment job . WOMAN worries about keeping her hair in style ; man worries about keeping his hair . This is one of his prime headaches . He seems to give this more thought than losing his job , his wife , or even his shirt studs . In fact , it 's so much on his mind that his favorite gesture is smoothing his hand over the top of his head just to be sure his hair is still there . You really ca n't blame him for his concern , because the whole picture of his getting bald is pretty grim . In the first place , the life of each hair on his head is just about half that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get bald than she is . It 's just about a fifty-fifty tossup he 'll get somewhat that way . The likelihood of loss is , in descending order , when it 's wavy , woolly , straight . And again in order , blond , brunet , red . However , there 's little need for him to worry until his middle thirties ? about the time his wife starts noticing gray hairs . Then , if he 's going to lose it , it will begin thinning gradually on top and shrinking around the temples . From then on his wife never will hear the end of it . Man at this stage of the game is a pushover for all sorts of tonics and restorers , which he hopes will make his  | hair grow . He spends more than $75,000. - 000 a year on them , plus unrecordec hours of speculation on whether they ' ; work . If they do n't , he has two courses c action . He can resort to concealing hi absence of hair with a toupee ( local ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pride and vanity and sport his pate in defiance Occasionally he even goes so far as to have it polished like an apple . Man 's artificial crowning glory ? though no woman can think of it with a straight face ? is no laughing matter with him . It : dead serious . And rather touchy . He keeps it just as much on the QT as his wife does her age . Even more so9 because he does n't have to divulge it on an auto license or marriage certificate , Even though it 's individually hushec up , collectively the business of retreading man 's pate is booming right now , In the past couple of decades , due to . so many waning-haired movie stars ' wearing toupees ( and perhaps your favorite ! ) , mar is going in for them more and more Sometimes he splurges on several , to coincide with his haircuts ! Nor are toupees so unstable as the old Mack Sennett comedies would have them In these scientific days they 're held or by springs , elastic , plaster ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're practically guaranteed against wind , tornado sudden shock ? in fact , almost everything except terrific concussion and out-andout pulling . ( Note : man 's ' toupee should not be worn swimming , and the place he ' ' most likely to lose it is in bed . ) Wigs are something else again . Only a few men wear wigs , and until the pasdecade or two wigs were pretty much limited to the Metropolitan Opera , octo genarians , actors , clowns , and Santas . But recently man has been going in more for wigs , because they 're being made to look not as his hair used to wher he did have it but as it would if he still had it . To wit : with graying temples , to match his eyebrows , thinner on top o* lighter in front to look bleached by the sun . Now he can fool the public fairly easily . Unless , of course , they 're smar enough to scrutinize and spot the artificia hairline at the back of his neck , IF MAN sports his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He can tell himself it stands for dignity and wisdom , mature philosophy stability and generosity , and symbolizes jolliness and joviality . Besides , he can take his stand in history beside such notables as Socrates , Julius Caesar , , John Quincy Adams , Oliver Goldsmith , And he nc longer has to worry about getting bald . His pate is far more hardy than his ancestors ' . It was to protect his - noggin against night vapors that man 's ancestor invented that most picturesque of male fashions ? the nightcap , Now only about 1 man in 1,000 wears a nightcap , and when man is aroused at midnight to investigate strange noises , he no longer looks like a Hogarth print , Man may scoff at woman for her old wives ' tales about everything from homemade remedies to strange superstitions but these are nothing compared to the horrors that haunt him about harming his hair . It 's high time some of these old husbands ' tales were brought to light For instance , he 's leery of cold shower : pattering on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hair wet . He 9 afraid of wearing a hat too much , wearing a hat too little , wearing a hat at all  | He shies away from eating too much fish , exposing his head to the sun , plastering his hair with a lot of lotion . Sometimes he 'll even search his genealogy for ancestral alopecia , to see if it has any bearing on his crowning glory . On the other hand , he 's always ready - in fact , eager ? to lend a willing ear to any advice or antics to help him hold that crowning glory . In the past he went overboard on charms and incantations . Now he does even stranger things ? from standing on his head regularly to tugging systematically at hair and whiskers . Of course , man 's hair is pretty valuable to him when he has it . But after it 's , one , there 's no earthly reason for him i to put such a premium on it . Compared to the hair of other domesticated mammals , man 's really does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it does n't go toward the making of cloth , hats , upholstery stiffening , fishlines , artists ' brushes , nail brushes , shaving brushes , or bombsights . As a matter of fact , it does n't even help another man ? woman 's hair makes man 's wigs . It 's funny the way man 's hair grows . You would n't believe it , but it 's true according to tonsorialists : The growth of his hair hits its peak between 10 and 11 A. M. , along with his business efficiency , 1 slows up later in the morning as he gets hungry for lunch , starts up again between 4 and 6 P. M. , when he 's finishing work , then eases off at night , as he does . OF COURSE , the male hairdo has n't always been so set in its ways . Time -. vas when it changed styles regularly , Frequently created a sensation , and was often so original that women copied it . " . Woman , always ready to experiment , in - the ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back on it with orror , and no woman would be caught - lead wearing it now . At various times man wore bang , pin , spiral , and sculptured curls , pigtails ; feather cuts ; windblown , shoulder-length , and pageboy bobs . He went in for all sorts of hair ornaments , from jewels and plumes to flowers and filets . He dyed his hair blue . He used to wear it long like Veronica Lake 's and in the upswept knot atop the head for which he 's recently been deriding his wife . Even if woman should aspire toward the improvement of the male hairdo ? as someday she well might ? there 's little she could do about it . Ever since Delilah did such a job on Samson , man has shied away from lady barbers ? which hardly seems fair when you think of all the males who have such a hand in woman 's coiffure . For , claims man , he just would n't trust her fooling around with his hair , because she might get creative . And he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady bartender.  |
