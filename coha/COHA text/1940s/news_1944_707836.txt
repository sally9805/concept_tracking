txt According to reports from Burope , the Regency Council of Bulgaria has refused an " invitation " from Adolf Hitler to come to his mountain home of Berchtesgaden for " consultations " on the war situation . The reports vary as to whether this refusal was outright or by indirection , but they agree that the Bulgarian answer was No  --  and this despite the presence of German troops on Bulgarian soil . Such a refusal , if it sticks , is a new experience for the would-be conqueror of the world . It is safe to assume that one reason for Bulgaria 's action is the recent Allied ultimatum warning all German satellites to get out of the war or take the consequences , coupled with specific Russian pressure on Germany 's only Slavic ally . But the real reason lies deeper . Until recently Bulgaria thought that it could play the jackal 's game and pick up loot in the wake of German conquests at the expense of Rumania , Greece and Yugoslavia . Now it knows that this is a losing game and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joined the losing side . But it also knows that it has joined a gangster partner of whom , for the moment , it is even more afraid than of its enemies . For before the eyes of every member of the " invited " Council must rise up the fate of all those many statesmen who also went to Betchtesgaden , or Berlin , or some other German rendezvous , only to discover that they had been trapped in the lair of a political cannibal who sought to devour both their persons and their nations . There was Chancellor Schuschnigg of Austria , summoned to Berchtesgaden and treated like a schoolboy , even forbidden to smoke in Hitler 's presence . Schuschnigg was compelled to open the way for the series of events that robbed his country of its freedom and landed him in a concentration camp . Then there was President Bache of Czechoslovakia , summoned to Berlin in the dead of night and subjected to such pressure that he had to be put under a physician 's care , until he signed away the independence of his country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but given such a display of German military might that he signed up with Germany and signed away the fate of his country and himself . There was Prince Paul of Yugoslavia , given similar treatment with similar results . There was Admiral Horthy , regent of Hungary , who was held a virtual prisoner during his German visit  --  until German troops had occupied his country . And there was , finally , and as a special reminder to the Bulgarian Regency , King Boris of Bulgaria himself , shot dead under mysterious circumstances while returning from a conference with Hitler in which he had refused Hitler 's demands . So frequent did the visits of foreign statesmen become that Berlin was for a time the political capital of the world . And to Hitler the visits of the statesmen were merely the heralds of vast multitudes which in future years would come to Germany to gaze on the miracles wrought by his regime . Times change , however . They are changing now . And even if this Bulgarian refusal turns out to be tempo rary it must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latest of his invitations .
