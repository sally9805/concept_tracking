txt Lou Gehrig , former first baseman of the New York Yankees and one of the outstanding batsmen baseball has known , died at his home , 5204 Delafield Avenue , in the Fieldston section of the Bronx , last night . Death came to the erstwhile " Iron Man " at 10:10 o'clock . He would have been 38 years old on June 19 . Regarded by some observers as the greatest player ever to grace the diamond , Gehrig , after playing in 2,130 consecutive championship contests , was forced to end his career in 1939 when an ailment that had been hindering his efforts was diagnosed as a form of paralysis . The disease was chronic , and for the last month Gehrig had been confined to his home . He lost weight steadily during the final weeks and was reported twenty-five pounds under weight shortly before he died . Member of Parole Board Until his illness became more serious Gehrig went to his office regularly to perform his duties as a member e the New York City Parole Commission , a post he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from baseball . Ever hopeful that he would be able to conquer the rare disease  --  amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , a hardening of the spinal cord  --  although the ailment was considered incurable by many , Gehrig stopped going to his desk about a month ago to conserve his strength . Two weeks ago he was confined to his bed , and from that time until his death his condition grew steadily worse . He was conscious until just before the end . At the bedside when he died were his wife , the former Eleanor Twitchell of Chicago ; his parents , Mr. and Mrs. Henry Gehrig ; his wife 's mother , Mrs. Nellie Twitchell , and Dr. Caldwell B. Esselstyn . It was said last night that funeral ' services would be private and would be held tomorrow morning at 10 o'clock in the Christ Episcopal Church in Riverdale . The Rev. Gerald V. Barry will officiate . The body was taken this morning to the E. Willis Scott Funeral ParIlor at 4 West Seventy-sixth Street . Record Spanned Fifteen Years When Gehrig stepped into the batter 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 , 1925 , he started a record that many believe will never be equaled in baseball . From that day on he never missed a championship game until April 30 , 1939 ? fifteen seasons of Yankee box scores with the name of Gehrig always in the line-up . He announced on May 2 , 1939 , that he would not play that day , and thus his streak came to an end . But as brilliant as was his career , Lou will be remembered for more than his endurance record . He was a superb batter in his heyday and a prodigious clouter of home runs . The record book is liberally strewn with his feats at the plate . Only in his first season , 1925 , and in his last full campaign , 1938 , did he fail to go over the .300 mark . Once he led the American League in hitting with .363 , but on three occasions he went over that with out winning the batting crown ? .373. .374 and .379 . But baseball has had other great hitters before and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combined with his other qualities that lifted him above the ordinary players and in a class all his own . An odd little incident gave Gehrig his start and an even stranger disease , one annost totally unknown for a robust athlete , brought it to an end . Columbia Lou 's string of consecutive games began , innocently enough , when the late Miller Huggins sent him up to bat for Peewee Wanninger on June 1 , 1925 . The husky 22-year old promptly singled . Huggins was impressed by the way Gehrig had delivered , but according to the tale that is told he had no notion of using him as a first baseman . Th2 Yankees had a star at the initial- sack in those days , Wally Pipp . But Pipp was troubled with frequent headaches . On June 2 he was bothered by pains in his head . " Has any one an aspirin tablet ? " asked Pipp . Huggins overheard him and , on a sheer hunch , decided to use the " kid " ? Gehrig  --  at first base . He never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later . Perhaps that story is not cut from the whole cloth . Gehrig has denied it , but Pipp insists just as vehemently that it is true . At any rate , it is an interesting sidelight on how a spectacular career was begun . Slipped in 1938 The beginning of the Gehrig playing days was abrupt but the ending was a much slower process . In 1937 the Iron Horse batted .351 , his twelfth successive season over the .300 mark . But in 1938 the Yankee captain slipped to .295 , the same figure he had established in his 1925 campaign . Not only his hitting but hi4 fielding had lost much of its crispness . Batted balls that the Gehrig of old had gobbled up easily skidded past him for base hits . In fact , the situation had developed to such an extent that there was continual talk in Spring training in 1939 that the endurance record was approaching its completion . This became even more obvious in the ea  --  iy games of the campaign . Yankee followers were amazed to see how badly Gehrig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near first base and only the fielding wizardry of Joe Gordon to his right saved Gehrig from looking very bad . The second sacker overshifted to cover the hole between him and his captain . Lou could n't I go to his right any more . At bat Gehrig was not even a pale shadow of his former self . Once he shad the outfielders backing up to the fences when he stepped to the plate . But this time he could hardly raise the ball out of the infield . On one occasion when he caromed a looping single to left  --  a certain double for even a slow runner  --  Gehrig was thrown out at second , standling up . Last Game Against Senators That day he saw the handwriting on the wall . And on April 30 , 1939 , he played his last big league game against the Washington Senators . The Bombers lost and Gehrig realized that he was a detriment to his team . When the Yanks took to the field again in Detroit on May 2 , Gehrig  --  his batting average down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game after 2,130 straight . He acted as nonplaying captain from that point on . On June 12 , when the Yankees engaged in an exhibition game in Kansas City , Lou played the last three innings , did nothing and promptly left for the Mayo Clinic . He was there - , . week , determined to discover just what was the matter with him . That something was wrong he was certain . On June 21 the diagnosis was made . It was that he had a mild attack of paralysis . His career thus was brought to an abrupt conclusion . And an amazing career it had been . Tribute by 61,808 at Retirement The public 's reaction to Gehrig 's swift retirement gave rise to one of the most inspiring and dramatic episodes in sport when on July 4 , in ceremonies preceding the afternoon 's holiday double-header , a crowd of 61,808 joined in the Lou Gehrig Appreciation Day exercises at the Yankee Stadium and thundered a " hail and farewell ' to baseball 's stricken Iron Horse . Players , officials , writers and employes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the spectacle coming when the Yankees themselves paraded on the field their world championship team of 1927 . From far and wide these dia- mond stalwarts had returned to join in the tribute to their former team-mate , who had managed to carry on long after their own retirement from the game . The group included such Yankee Immortals as Babe Ruth , Waite Hoyt , Bob Meusel , Herb Pennock , Joe Dugan , Tony Lazzeri , Mark Koenig , Benny Bengough , Wally Schang , Everett Scott , Wally Pipp , George Pipgras and Bob Shawkey . Overcome by this spontaneous reception , Gehrig finally mastered his emotions , and , in perhaps the most remarkable valedictory ever delivered in a sport arena , literally poured his heart out to his great throng of listeners , thanking them for their appreciation and assuring them , with characteristic pluck , that he still considered himself " the luckiest fellow on earth , with much to live for . " From then until the end of the season Gehrig stuck by his guns as retired field captain , and spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on all its road trips , and at the finish sat through all four of the 1939 world series games in which his colleagues crushed another National League rival . With the close of the campaign , Lou retired himself within a small circle of close friends , spent much time in fishing , a sport second only to baseball in its fascination for him , and on Oct. 11 figured in another surprise move when Mayor La Guardia announced his appointment to a ten-year term as a member of the three-man Municipal Parole Commission at a salary of $5,700 a year . He tackled with considerable enthusiasm this newest job that was to launch him upon a new chapter in his astounding career . In Spotlight Again Although anxious to . go quietly about his new task and remain as mush as possible in complete retirement , Gehrig was catapulted prominently into the spotlight again in mid-August of the 1940 pennant campaign when a New York newspaper , in a featured article , intimated that the extraordinary collapse of the four - time world champion Yankees might be attributable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infected with Gehrig 's disease . The story brought vehement protests from the Yankee players , who insisted they were suffering from no physical ailments and then , as if in final rebuttal to the charge , the Yanks , within a few days after publication of the article , launched their spectacular drive which was to lift them from fifth place into the thick of the flag race throughout the month of September . In the meantime , Gehrig had papers served for a $1,000,000 libel action , while the publication printed an apology to Gehrig , stating that thorough investigation revealed that Lou 's ailment was not communicable . No legal action was taken after this . Gehrig was born in New York on June 19. 1903 . His career began unobtrusively enough when , as a husky youngster , he reported for the High School of Commerce nine in New York . He was tried in the outfield , where he was no Joe DiMaggio at catching fly balls . He was tried as pitcher but was as wild . He was tried as a first baseman and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his ever ready grin , by saying " We were mighty short on infielders in those days . " In his first season on the Commerce team he batted .170 . Then he started hitting until he cracked the headlines with a crash in 1920 . Commerce , the New York schoolboy champions , played Lane Tech of Chicago in a scholastic " world series . " The single game was played at Wrigley Field and Gehrig was awed by his surroundings . But he was not too awed . In the ninth inning with Commerce one run behind and the bases full he drove a home run over the right field fence . Columbia All-Around Player Buster Gehrig was beginning to take shape . He matriculated at Columbia , pitching , outfielding and playing first base . He was a good enough college pitcher but did have the knack of hitting home runs . For one year there he also tried football , but that sport did not have the same appeal that baseball bore . The diamond game carried such a zest for him that he quit before he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1923 . He played thirteen games before Huggins decided that he was not yet ready for major league ball . Farmed out to Hartford in the Eastern League , he batted .304 for the rest of the season . Back with the Yanks the next campaign he followed the identical procedure . He took part in ten games and then it was a return trip to Hartford , where he began to belabor the fences in the circuit , hitting .369 . That figure was an eye-opener to Huggins , who recalled him the following season . That was in 1925 . Gehrig batted .295 in 126 gamesand then he began to rocket through the baseball firmament . His first full season showed him with .313 , but after that his successive batting averages were .373 , .374 , .300 , .379 , .341 , .349 , .334 , .363 , .329 , .354 , .351 and finally he was back to .295 in his last full campaign . The .363 average gave him the batting championship in 1934 , but signal honors had come to him before that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was voted the most valuable player in the American League . Seven times he participated in world series and , oddly enough , was a star on the Yankees of 1926-27-28 and with the all-star contingent of 1936-37-38 . Each of these groups has its supporters as the greatest baseball team of all time . RuthGehrig-Meusel , the famed " Murderers ' Row , " or DiMaggio-GehrigDickey ? Those were the batting fulcrums around which the teams revolved . Columbia Lou was the lone tie between the two . His series deeds have been aweinspiring . His lifetime average in world series games was .361 ? his full regular average .340  --  and twice he hit over the fantastic mark of .500 , with .545 in 1928 and .529 in 1932 . Babe Ruth , however , holds the series record of .625 in 1928 . That is an oddity in itself , Gehrig with two terrific averages but still behind the Babe . Yet for the better part of his career the Iron Horse was to be in the shadow of Ruth . Lou entered baseball when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no man has straddled it before or since . Gehrig never left that shadow . His all-time home run production was 494 , a figure topped by only two men , Ruth and Jimmy Foxx , who at the end of 1940 had reached a 500 total . For many years Lou gave the Babe his closest pursuit in the home-run derby , but he never caught him until the Babe 's last year as a Yankee . Only when the King was on the decline did the Crown Prince win the home-run championship of the league , 49 in 1934 . For one thing , Gehrig did not have the flamboyant Ruth personality . They were team-mates but far apart , one quiet , reserved and efficient and the other boisterous , friendly and efficient . Let it not be deduced that the Iron Horse was not of the friendly type . He was pleasant at all times , but unlike Ruth he never considered the world at large as his particular friend . Whereas the Babe would greet all and sundry with a booming " Hiya , kid ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were sharp contrasts , those two , both hulking men but as far apart as the two poles . Ruth was Gehrig 's boyhood idol , and with the passing years Lou never lost that respect for the Home Run King . And in spite of his own tremendous record , Gehrig was always subordinated to Ruth . What a pair they mace at the plate , coming up to bat in order ! Each was likely to drive the ball out of the park . Frequently either or both did just that . In fact , one of the many records that Lou set was that of hitting the most home runs with the bases filled , a startling twenty-three . Another was of four homers in one game . The Ruthian association affected Gehrig 's salary in two respects . In one way the heavy blow that Ruth struck at the payroll kept Lou from getting a compensation as close to the Babe 's as their relative batting averages would indicate . Yet , on the other hand , the Bambino lifted the scale so high that Gehrig probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ruth to blaze the trail . Made Fortune in Game Like most payrolls , the Yankee Ione is not open to the public gaze , but is more public property than an ordinary business . So the amount of money that Gehrig received each season is part guess and part accurate knowledge , especially in the more recent years when the Federal income tax rolls ceased being secret . The general estimate is that the Iron Horse received a total of $361 , - 500 in salary from the Yankees . Since he participated in seven world series where the share always was heavy his total income from baseball is estimated at $400,000. aehrig received $3,750 in his first season , $6,500 in his second year . This advanced $1,000 in 1927 and then the Iron Horse moved into the big-money class . He never dropped out of five figures for the rest of his career . For the next five years he received $25,000 and then he dropped to $23 , - 000 for 1933 and 1934 , after which he received $31,000 in 1935 and 1936 , $36,750 in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a campaign in which he played only eight games . Baseball contracts are peculiar things , strictly one way . The club has the upper hand at all times and can sever any contract at will . Had they so desired the Yanks could have dropped Gehrig the day the report from the Mayo Clinic arrived . But he was kept on full salary for the remainder of the year . So firm was his place in the Yankee scheme of things that Manager Joe McCarthy refused to break the Gehrig string even when there was a clamor to the effect that the Iron Horse himself would benefit from it . Marse Joe shook his head to that . " Gehrig plays as long as he wants to play , " he said . Not many ball players would be granted such a privilege . But in this respect McCarthy knew his man and knew him well . He realized that once Lou discovered his form had departed and that he was hindering the progress of the team he would call it quits . And that is what happened . Had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have continued as a part-time performer . Ball players do not go as fast as he went . The disintegration always is gradual enough for managers and club owners to make preparations . But the Yankees were caught without an adequate substitute for him , only the light-hitting but surefielding Babe Dahlgren . Previously , being Gehrig 's replacement had been the height of frustration . There was just no hope that he ever would give why to any one else . In their thorough fashion the Yankees had had several first basemen on their farm teams . All of them pleaded to be sold or traded elsewhere so that they would be able to play regularly . One was Buddy Hassett , now at first base for the Boston Braves . Another was George , hard-hitting initial sacker for the St. Louis Browns . Many others have paraded into the Yankee orbit and out again , balked of their desire by the stalwart figure of Lou Gehrig . The day before he entered the Mayo Clinic for the examination baseball celebrated its centennial at Cooperstown and the Hall of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and within a short time another bronze plaque joined the Babe 's as Henry Louis Gehrig took his proper place among the alltime greats that this sport had pro-1 duced . For though Baseball 's Hall of Fame committee decided to hold no elections for new candidates in 1939 , it chose , upon recommendation of the Baseball Writers Association of America , to make an exception and name Gehrig as the lone Hall of Fame award for the year .
