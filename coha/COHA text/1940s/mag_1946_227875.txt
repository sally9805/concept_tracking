The Pawnee ( Oklahoma ) Chief was fat with political ads . Neal Vaughan ( farmer , good road man ) was running for County Commissioner . Amos Teter ( lived in Pawnee County most of his life ) was a candidate for Assessor . Roy L. Owens ( common sense , clean personal character ) was up for re-election as sheriff . But except for the hazy looking cuts of THESE CAPABLE MEN the Chief looked about the same as usual . The big Page One story was headed : BLANCHARDS SELL 849 TURKEYS . <P> In a week in which U.S. citizens had their date in the voting booth , the Chief made no attempt to feel the pulse of the nation or even of Pawnee County . Neither did the Lenox Time Table ( " The Only Newspaper in the World That Cares Two Whoops for Lenox , Iowa " ) nor the Trinity County ( Calif . ) Journal , nor any of the rest of the Bugles , Couriers and Standards which came smudgily from flat-bed presses in the nation 's small towns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation 's country weeklies held a feel and flavor of U.S. life which no big-city daily captured . Their editors really knew the people who were voting . <P> The Sabula ( Iowa ) Gazette was able to note that " Virtus Peterson of near Green Island called at the Gazette and would like to buy about half a bushel of rye seed . " The Chenoa ( Ill . ) Clipper-Times announced that the second grade was enjoying the reading of Billy Whiskers at the Circus , which was brought to school by Bobby Ritter . The Cassville ( Wis . ) American reported : " Wilbur K. Buschbom , otherwise Billy , returned Tuesday morning from the Carolinas . He is a cowboy rider and does trick roping . A fascinating , if dangerous life ? Young Billy says , ' It beats workin ' . ' " <P> The advertisements held news , too . Autumn was the time for auctions . The Pulaski County ( Indiana ) Democrat heralded John Manning 's public sales , three miles west of Medaryville . Manning offered two horses ( smooth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bred in August ) , 25 head of hogs , assorted farm implements , an iron butchering kettle and two electric fence chargers . The Palace Theater 's advertisement in the Hills ( Minn . ) Crescent ballyhooed a new picture-Johnny Mack Brown ( half forgotten by city audiences ) in a Western titled Ghost Guns . <P> Weekly items reflected the activity of a vast if diffused part of the nation 's business . In the Northwest they discussed gyppo logging shows . The Martha 's Vineyard ( Mass . ) Vineyard Gazette grumbled about the price of fish : " The market , as we log the doings of last week , is plain lousy-prices dropped like a skate falling into an empty hold . Why ? The Lord only knows . But Bay scallops continue to be small and high . . . . Hard up or hard down is the present motto of business . " <P> " Bounteous Refreshments . " With crops in and the weather fine , the weeklies ' readers also spent a lot of time just enjoying themselves . Innumerable families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or St. Joseph , Mo . Ladies Aid societies , Jolly Hour Clubs , bridge and church groups met and " partook of bounteous refreshments . " There was pheasant hunting on the fields of the Middle West . Thousands of high-school football teams " clashed at the local gridiron . " There were Halloween parties , golden weddings , marriages , christenings.
