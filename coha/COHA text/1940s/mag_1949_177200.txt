The rumble of moving furniture came again last week from the blank-walled Soviet fortress . This time it was a brief official announcement that Marshal Nikolai Bulganin , 53 , had been " relieved of his duties " as Minister of Armed Forces and replaced in that post by Marshal Alexander Vasilevsky ( also 53 ) . Again speculation buzzed through the free world . What did this rumble mean ? <P> Bulganin has been a faithful party henchman since the Revolution , mostly in administrative duties of various sorts . He is not a Red Army career man ; when the Germans invaded Russia in 1941 he was appointed political commissar on the Moscow front , and in 1942 when the city was saved he was handed high military rank . He took over from Stalin himself as Minister of Armed Forces in 1947 . Vasilevsky , a medal-shingled career soldier who came to the top in the war , distinguished himself at Sevastopol , Voronezh , Stalingrad . <P> As in the case of Molotov 's replacement by Vishinsky as Foreign Minister , it seemed extremely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a demotion . Like Molotov , Bulganin remained a member of the all-powerful Politburo . It was possible that he had been moved up , either to an inner advisory group on the Politburo , or to the Central Committee 's Military Department , the Communist Party 's hidden organ which controls the Ministry of Armed Forces . One trend was clear : all but one ( Minister of Light Industry A. N. Kosygin ) of the Politburo 's 13 members have been relieved of routine administrative duties . Perhaps they needed to be free to think , and think hard , in view of crucial policy decisions ahead .
