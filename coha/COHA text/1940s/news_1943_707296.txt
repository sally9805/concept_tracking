By HAROLD CALLIENDER . Specie. / to Pars NSW roam Tames . WASHINGTON , Aug. 26 ? The long-awaited Allied decision regarding the status of the French Committee of National Liberation at Algiers was made public tonight in the form of a statement by President Roosevelt and a similar but not identically phrased statement by the British Government , recognizing the committee for the I war period as the administrative authority for the French overseas territories under its control but not as a government of France or of the French Empire . Final agreement upon the form of recognition was reached at the conference at Quebec between the President and Prime Minister Churchill , with Secretary of State Cordell Hull and British Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden present . The official announcement was withheld until the other members of the United Nations and the French Committee had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Russian Government has been informed of the decision taken at Quebec but , so far as is known here , has not yet announced what form its recognition will take . The Moscow radio announced , early today that the Soviet Government had recognized the French Committee of National Liberation " as the representative of the State interests of the French Republic , " according to the Federal Communications Commission . Brazil and Peru announced that they had recognized the committee , and Bolivia and Ecuador indicated they would take similar action , The United Press reported . The limitations attached to the recognition were defined in much the same terms in the Washington and London statements . Although the phraseology of the London statement was somewhat softer , its meaning was the same as the President 's . The principal difference of substance between the two was that the British statement mentioned the possible need to revise agreements made between the British Government and the French National Committee headed by Gen. Charles de Gaulle in London from June , 1940 , onward when that committee was accepted as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war . One such agreement covered // A QUEBEC DECISION MADE ON FRENCH // the status of French territories in the Levant taken by the British and the Fighting French . The British Treasury 's contribution to the de Gaulle committee , which has amounted to about $60,000,000 a year , already has been transferred to the new committee in Algiers . While both governments expressed their desire to cooperate with patriotic Frenchmen to liberate France and welcomed the establishment of the committee , they pointed out that their relationship with the committee , as the President put it , " must continue to be subject to the military requirements of the Allied commanders . " The British statement expressed the same qualification by saying " All controls necessary for operational purposes are * * * reserved to the Supreme Commander of the Allied Armies in any theatre of operations . " Both statements defined the status of the committee as " administering those French overseas territories which acknowledge its authority . " But the British statement added that it was recognized by London also as having assumed the functions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Levant . The following sentences of Mr. Roosevelt 's statement have no counterpart in the British state-ment : " This statement does not constitute a recognition of a Government of France or of the French Empire by the Government of the United States . It does constitute recognition of the French Committee of National Liberation as functioning within specific limitations during the war . " The President thus made explicit beyond any misunderstanding the limitations that the British Government left implicit . Mr. Roosevelt was also somewhat more emphatic in referring to the French people 's prospective selection of their own government " in a free and untrammeled manner . " His language was likewise more terse than the British when he said that , while noting with sympathy the committee 's desire to be regarded as the body qualified to insure the administration and defense of French interests , " the extent to which it may be possible to give effect to this desire must , however , be reserved for consideration in each case as it arises . " The British preferred to put the same stipulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of His Majesty 's Government to give effect to this request as far as possible while reserving the right to consider , in consultation with the committee , the practical application of this principle in particular cases as they arise . " Soviet Extends Recognition Following is the text of a Moscow domestic broadcast last night announcing Soviet recognition of the French Committee of National Liberation , as reported by the Federal Communications Commission ? " Recognition of the French Committee of National Liberation by the Soviet Government : " On June 17 the French Committee of National Liberation handed to the Soviet Government its declaration of June 3 and its appeal on the question of its recognition . " On Aug. 26 the Commissariat of Foreign Affairs nn instructions of the Soviet Government informed the French Committee of National Liberation of the following . " The Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics , having acquainted itself with the declaration of the French Committee of National Liberation , has decided to recognize the French Committee of National Liberation as representative 3f the State interests of the French Republic and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to exchange plenipotentiary representatives with it .
