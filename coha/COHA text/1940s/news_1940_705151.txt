txt Eight young divinity students were in jail last night , starting to serve prison terms incurred by their refusal to register under the Selective Service Act . None could have been called tor service under the draft law , but all had maintained that their consciences prevented them even from complying with the procedure of registration . Each was sentenced to a year and a day . They persisted in their refusal to register yesterday morning , as they stood in a group before the bench in the crowded Federal courtroom . Each told Judge Samuel Mandelbaum that he found it impossible to register . They all knew that Judge Mandelbaum vanted to set them free , if only they would at last comply with the law . They knew that United States Attorney John T. Cahill , while he recommended the sentence of a year and a day , still hoped they would relent . But none did , and one even rebuked the Federal officials for the " stress upon leniency " which he said he and his fellow defendants " did not particularly like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies at Union Theological Seminary are being interrupted by the prison sentence , had pleaded guilty . They all were willing to accept the penalty for their action .. The story of their activities was explained to the court by Mr. Cahill. as follows : " These eight defendants are charged with a violation of the Selective Service and Training Act of 1940 . Their violation constitutes a deliberate refusal to register as required by the Act . All of the defendanto are divinity students and as such are exempt from military service under the Act , but not from registration . " The defendants place their refusal to register upon grounds of conscience . The 1940 Selective Service Act makes specific provision for conscientious objectors and exempts them from military service . These provisions have been pointed out to the defendants and they have been urged to register and thereafter note their conscientious objection in the manner and form provided by die law . This they have refused to do . " After the day fixed for registration had passed and prior to their indictment , these defendants were again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and by the grand jury itself . Right up until the last minute before they were indicted , they were offered the opportunity of complying with the law , even at that late date . They have , however , persisted and they continue to persist in their refusal to register . " Court Term " Kept Open " Mr. Cahill asked that the " term of the court be kept open , " a technical move that will make it possible for Judge Mandelbaum to free the young men at any time that they agree to register . This request was readily granted by the court . Even if they do not register , however , the youthful prisoners may be released on parole at the end of four months . Kenneth Walser , a lawyer , accompanied the young men at their arraignment , but even he said that he had not received a single request for leniency . He pointed out that the object of the registration was identification of all men of draft age . He said that the young men had identified themselves by leaving signed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of registration . He pleaded for a suspended sentence , declaring that the defendants were in a class by themselves . Any impression that draft dodgers were being treated too easily could be corrected as soon as the first case involving " ordinary draft dodgers " came before the court . Each of the young men then stated his reason for refusing to register . All were concerned with pious principles . The eight then reiterated their statements of inability to register , and Judge Mandelbaum passed sentence . " This is a national emergency , where the very life , liberty and defense of our country are at stake , and I have no other alternative but to enforce the law , " he said . The eight young men were immediately taken out of the courtroom by deputy United States marshals . They went to the Federal House of Detention to await transportation to a prison , probably at Lewisburg , Pa. , or Danbury , Conn . Some of the girls and older women in the courtroom wept , and one elderly man , who carried a book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another triumph for Hitler . " The prisoners were Joseph G. Bevilacqua of Buffalo , George M. Houser of Denver , Howard E. Spragg of Malden , Mass. ; Meredith Dallas of Grosse Pointe , Mich. ; David Dellinger of Wakefield , Mass. ; Donald Benedict of Newark , William N. Lovell of Poughkeepsie and Richard J. Wichlei of Binghamton , N. Y. All were college graduates . Dr. Henry Sloane Coffin , president of the seminary , issued a statement expressing the hope that " once having made their position clear " the young men would be able to see that " no further purpose can be served by persisting in this course . " Colonel Arthur V. , head of the Selective Service Administration in this area , said he considered the sentences as " a very salutary thing . " Ernest Angell , chairman of the National Committee on Conscientious Objectors , said the sentence was " much more severe than that which would have been meted out to a non-registrant in England .
