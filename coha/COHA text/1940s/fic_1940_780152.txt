 | " Then , what is your interest in all this ? Mr. Orpington . . . and . . . well , all this . " Johnny leaned against the nearest wire coop and said , confidentially : " Well , I 'll tell you , Miss Thompson . Sam and I were having a drink in a certain Main Street cocktail lounge when a man came in  --  a perfect stranger  --  and began complaining about how he could n't get a hotel room for love or money . From the generosity of my heart , I offered him bunk space in our own ample room at the Carter-Lambert . " " You offered to share your room with a perfect stranger  --  Mr. Orpington ? " " Strange as it seems , that 's exactly what we did . But let me go on with the story a bit . While we were having a friendly drink at this cocktail lounge and saloon , a young lady wearing the most beautiful silver fox cape I ever saw in my life came up and began talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only it was n't a dog  --  it was a fox . Shall I go on , Miss . Thompson ? " " Do , " she said , tightly . " Well , Mr. Orpington and the beautiful young lady in the beautiful fox coat recognized each other , but neither would admit it ? " " Did he say that he knew me ? " " No , he never said a word about you , afterwards . Oh  --  the beautiful young lady was you ? " She flushed . " Go on with your story . But make  | it more convincing . That matter of sharing your room with Mr. Orpington . " " You do n't believe that ? It 's really true . You see . . . we were down to our last dime and we soaked Orp for five dollars for his share of the room . Does that make it sound better ? " " Some . But suppose this beauti  --  this girl in the fox cape saw the three of you leave the cocktail lounge and start for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were n't in your room  --  when it happened . " Johnny held up his left hand , fingers spread apart . He doubled the index finger : " Item one  --  after we chiseled the fiver from Orpy , we gave him the key to our room and told him to make himself at home . We dashed across the street to Nick the Greek 's and murdered two thick porterhouse steaks . With onions and French fries . Item two . . . " he doubled the second finger , " when we returned to our room , Orpington was . . . dead . But the fox was n't . . . . " " I heard you from my own room , " said Jessie Thompson . " I also heard a shot ! " " Ah , " said Johnny , " that 's the crux of the whole situation . We stayed in the room not more than ? I should say  --  sixty seconds . No shot , I assure you , was fired while we were there . " Her face clouded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a door slam violently . . . . "  | Johnny leaned forward eagerly : " How long after ? " " Two minutes . Not more than three . " " By that time we were in the room across the hall ? 516 ! " " It was a loud shot . You did n't hear it across the hall ? " " No . You see , there was a crap game  --  and a lot of argument . We would n't have heard a machine gun , except for one moment when No-Dice rolled a seven for my three dollars and eighty cents . And then the cops came . . . . " " And here , " said Jessie Thompson , " comes one now . Lieutenant Cantrell . " Johnny whirled . The big lieutenant of the Cedar City police department was bearing down upon him , a scowl upon his broad face .  | Chapter Six " Ah , good morning , Lieutenant , " said Johnny . Lieutenant Cantrell glared at Johnny , shifted his gaze deliberately to Jessie Thompson and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Johnny Fletcher . " Thought I told you not to leave the hotel ? " " That was last night . You did n't think I 'd stay there waiting for you to release me from that order ? Why , you might have forgotten all about me . " " I never forget any one , " retorted Cantrell . He took a folded newspaper from his pocket . " Seen this morning 's paper ? " Johnny shook his head . " No , the hotel did n't put one under my door . " He leaned over and got a quick glimpse of Alfred Orpington 's features spread over two columns . Underneath was a two column head : NOTED FOX EXHIBITOR KILLED BY FOX " I 've been working on this all night , " Cantrell went on . " There was a baggage check in his pocket . He 'd checked a bag at the depot ? " " Say , " said Johnny Fletcher , admiringly . " That  | was clever of you . I never noticed that he did n't have any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Cantrell looked suspiciously at Johnny . " Why should you notice ? I only had you in the room a couple of minutes . " " That 's right , but I 've got an observing eye . I looked around to see if our own luggage had been touched . There were two bags , you know  --  mine and my friend 's . " " Each containing a shirt , a pair of socks and a toothbrush . I looked in ' em . " " We have a trunk full of clothes that we keep in our car , " Johnny said , red-faced . He shot a quick look at Jessie Thompson . Lieutenant Cantrell nodded , smiled and suddenly held out his hand . " Let me see your room key . " Johnny took a step back . " Room key ? " he asked , stalling for time . " Why . . . I did n't take it with me . It 's at the hotel .... " " No , " said Lieutenant Cantrell , " I asked this morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his pockets . " Have you go it , Sam ? " Sam Cragg went through his pockets . " If we did n't leave it at the desk yesterday afternoon , we must have lost it . "  | Lieutenant Cantrell took a key , with a tag , from his pocket . " Is this it ? " Johnny examined the key . " It looks like it , " he admitted , cautiously . " It is n't . At least not the one you think . It 's the duplicate the hotel people gave me . Just in case . " " Then there 's still one missing .... " " Oh , no . " Lieutenant Cantrell took an ink pad from his pocket and two glossy white cards . " All right , boys , your prints . " " What for ? " asked Johnny . " Naturally , you 'll find our prints all over the room . After all , we were in it for an hour or so in the afternoon . . . . " " We 'll take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prints with the missing key tag , which we have down at headquarters . " " Then you 've got it ! " " Of course . We picked it up in the room last night . It 's got Mr. Orpington 's prints . Some others , too . Maybe yours . . . . " " Sure . We must have had a key . I do n't pay any attention to such things . We checked into the hotel , stayed there a while , then went out to look the town over . We left the key at the desk . If it 's got Orpington 's prints on it , that 's simple enough . He was in our room , so  --  he just went to the hotel , picked a room number at random and asked for the key .  | The hotel clerk handed it to him . They ca n't remember all their guests , you know . " Lieutenant Cantrell was busy applying first Johnny 's then Sam 's fingerprints to the ink pad and then rolling them on the glossy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There were some strange prints on the valise . If your prints should happen to check with those , it would prove something , would n't it ? " Cold fingers seemed to tighten around Johnny Fletcher 's throat . Had he touched the valise ? No ... he did n't recall ; but Sam . . . . Sam had stooped and fooled around with the valise in the Main Street Cocktail Lounge , when he 'd thought the bag contained a dog . And so . . . for that matter , had Jessie Thompson ! Her prints might be on the bag . Johnny took a handkerchief from his pocket and wiped the ink from his fingers . He said , casually : " Does n't this seem like a lot of trouble , Lieutenant , for a man who was killed by a fox ? " " Oh , " said Cantrell , " did n't I tell you ? Orpington was n't killed by that fox . He was . . . mur-dered ! " Johnny pretended astonishment . " Murder ! . How ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a .32 caliber bullet . Fired by the same gun that killed the fox . " " But the wound ! " exclaimed Johnny .  | " I think I 'll go , " said Jessie Thompson , suddenly . She turned and walked quickly away , fumbling at her purse . For a handkerchief . Cantrell made a clucking sound with his tongue against the roof of his mouth . " Women get sick , that way . What were you asking , Fletcher ? " " Orpington 's throat ; it seemed all ripped to pieces . . . . " " Yeah , that 's what Doc Meloney said . Well , the fox did n't do it . There was n't any blood on his mouth . So it must have been the murderer , trying to make it look as if the fox had killed Orpington . It concealed the bullet wound , you know . " Johnny shuddered . " What a way to kill a man ! " Cantrell put away his ink pad and the cards containing Sam 's and Johnny 's fingerprints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today ? " " Of course . We 've got to earn a living , you know . " " Uh-huh . Well , do n't go leaving town . There are some angles in this case I 'm working on and I might want to question you again . I 'll be seeing you . . . . Cantrell walked off , stopping here and there to look at a caged fox . Sam Cragg stepped up beside Johnny and whispered , " Say , I 'm almost sure I touched that fox bag in the saloon last night . It 'll have my prints . "  | " I was afraid of that . Well , it ca n't be helped . I 'll have to think up an answer to that . " " You ca n't . We told him we never saw Orpington alive . I think we ought to scram . Right now , before he checks up those prints .... " " Scram ? " asked Johnny . " You do n't think the lieutenant was stupid enough not to put a tail on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . " Sam Cragg craned his neck in the direction Johnny had indicated . He saw Detective Otto Holtznagle , Cantrell 's stooge , pretending to examine a white Holland turkey tom . " That thickhead ! " exclaimed Sam . " We can shake him . " " What good would it do ? If we beat it , they 'd put it on the teletype and they 'd pick us up sooner or later . And then they 'd be sure we knocked off Orpington . Our best bet 's to stick it out and figure out some answers . In the meantime , let 's go earn some money . There are plenty of people around now . " But before they could move off , Jessie Thompson returned . With her were a man and a woman . The woman wore a fox cape that was an exact duplicate of her own . The woman , however , was at least five years older than Jessie Thompson , which still kept her age under thirty . She was a blonde . Johnny , looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fletcher , " said Jessie Thompson . " This is Mr. and Mrs. Wallace Erb . They 're exhibiting foxes here . . . . And Mr. Cragg ! " " How do you do , " Johnny said . He bowed to Mrs. Erb and shook hands with her husband , who was almost twice his wife 's age and had a lean hatchet face with a saturnine cast to it . " You showing foxes ? " Wallace Erb asked . Jessie Thompson answered for Johnny . " No , they 're not . But Mr. Cragg expressed an interest in buying a pair for breeding purposes . Why do n't you and Mrs. Erb show him your animals ? " Sam Cragg blinked , but before he quite understood how it happened he was moving off with Mr. and Mrs. Erb and Jessie Thompson was saying , hurriedly to Johnny : " Did you or your friend touch that valise last night ? " Johnny nodded . " Sam did . And you ? ... " " Yes . They 'll find my fingerprints on it . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me with it . After all  --  I was the one who reported the shot to the hotel desk . " " Two shots , Miss Thompson , " Johnny corrected . " One for Orpington and one ? " " I heard what Lieutenant Cantrell told you . But I swear I only heard one shot . "  | " When did you start for the hotel , right after we left the cocktail lounge ? " " No . I had another drink . About fifteen minutes , I 'd say . " " We took about a half hour to eat . That means Orpington was dead about fifteen minutes then , before we returned . The shot that killed him was fired before you got to your room . Well , that narrows it down somewhat . " " I do n't see how that helps . I 've got to think of some explanation for my fingerprints . . . . " " Why ? Lieutenant Cantrell did n't take your fingerprints , did he ? Apparently he has no suspicion that you even knew Orpington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to stop there . Since it 's a murder case and Mr. Orpington was a fox breeder , he 'll get around sooner or later to checking up on rival exhibitors . . . which will include my brother and me . " Johnny shrugged . " Perhaps . The lieutenant 's smarter than I thought he was , last night . By the way  --  may I ask why your brother did n't come out here with you ? " " He had some business in Chicago . " " Oh , then he did n't stay at home after you left ? " " No , we left together . It was just that he wanted to stop over another day in Chicago . However , he 's due here sometime this morning . "  | " You do n't know  --  for sure  --  that he stayed in Chicago ? He could have come out here yesterday , and . . . well , not told you about it ? " Jessie Thompson 's nostrils flared a little . " Are you  --  insinuating  --  that Hal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all . Just trying to get things clear in my own mind . " Her face turned sidewards a little and she looked at him through lowered lashes . " You 're somewhat of a detective yourself , Mr. Fletcher . At least , you ask questions like one . . .. " Johnny turned the palms of his hands upward and looked at them modestly . " I like to read detective stories . And this  --  well , I am sort of interested in it personally , you know . " " Yes , of course . Well , I guess your friend did n't buy any foxes , after all . " Sam Cragg was actually fleeing from Mr. and Mrs. Erb . He was mopping his forehead with a handkerchief . " Johnny , " he said , " did you know that a pair of breeding foxes cost twenty-five hundred bucks ? " Johnny closed one eye and grinned at Jessie Thompson . " Why did n't you write them out a check ? See you later , Miss Thompson ! " Going down between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mike was just shaking  | hands with a middle-aged farmer . " Thank you , sir , and I 'm sure you 'll not regret it ! " He turned his back upon the farmer , stuffed a bill into his pocket and said , brightly : " Keep a few poultry , sir ? " Then he recognized his intended victims . " Oh , you fellows ! " " Such grammar , tsk , tsk ! " chided Johnny . " Keep a few poultry ! " Lord Mike grinned . " Not the best King 's English , what ? But that 's the way I learned it , from Chicken Cutler himself . The best man who ever wrote sheet . " " He was , " agreed Johnny . " I think I 'll go out and see if there 's any folding money to be had . " " Good luck , Johnny . By the way , what 's NoDice doing out here ? " " No-Dice , here ? " " Yes , I saw him sneaking through five minutes ago when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fairs and exhibitions , but he stays in the hotels . Never saw him on any fairgrounds , before . " " Maybe he 's gone back to his old line , picking pockets ! " " Ha ! You do n't like No-Dice , I take it ? " " I do n't like him , " Johnny said , " and I do n't like the way he handles the dice . I 've got an idea he made a monkey out of me last night . He knew that  | I would holler no dice ' the first time he rolled them out . " " But he used a water glass , " exclaimed Mike . " He could n't stack the dice with that . " " Could n't he ? I do n't know . Next time I shoot craps with him he 's going to use a dice cup and bump them against a wall ! Come on , Sam , we 've got work to do . " They left the poultry building and , watching until no one was near their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy cartons . Sam Cragg carried one easily in each hand , although each weighed more than fifty pounds .  | Chapter Seven Johnny Fletcher 's eyes searched the grounds . He winced when he saw a man with a white arm band and a badge on his coat . " So it 's like that , " he said to Sam Cragg . " They 're going to try to keep fellows from making an honest dollar . " " They 'll let us work on the grounds if we pay a fee . And that 's something we have n't got any of . How much you figure they 'll want , Johnny ? " " They 'll take twenty , but right now it might as well be a thousand . " He shook his head . " We 've got to get a stake . And soon , Sammy . . . . Mmm ! " He looked thoughtfully at a huge building , toward which most of the crowds were going . " Come on , Sam , let 's see what 's going on in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw a bulletin board beside the entrance . On it was a notice : Professor H. A. Messerschmidt of the Iowa Agricultural College will speak at 10:00 A.M. on the subject of : " Increasing Milk Production In Your Herd . " Admission Free .  | " That 's one thing we can do without , " Sam Cragg said . Johnny shook his head . " No , that 's where you 're wrong , Sammy , old boy . A stray idea is kicking around in my noggin and it 's about time . I think . . .. Yes , I think we 're about to go to work . " He stuck his head into the door and jerked it out again . There was a gleam in his eyes as he turned to Sam Cragg . " Sam , " he said , " It is apparently after ten , for a bird who could n't be anybody else but Professor Messerschmidt is boring about five hundred people to the point where they 're about to walk out on him . We would n't want them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A startled look came to Sam Cragg 's eyes . " Whaddya going to pull ? " Johnny 's mouth became a thin , straight line . " We 're going in there and put on a pitch , that 's what ? " Sam exclaimed hoarsely . " You ca n't do that , Johnny ! God , you ca n't ! They 'll throw us out before we even get started . " " Maybe they will and maybe they wo n't . We 're down to bed rock . They wo n't let us work the grounds without paying a fee and we have n't got a dime . . . . Have you got any better ideas ? " " No , but ? " A shudder ran through Sam Cragg  | and he backed away from Johnny Fletcher . Johnny followed him , talking desperately . " Here 's what you do , Sam . You go to the nearest telephone and call this place  --  it 's the Educational Building . Tell whoever answers the telephone that it 's long distance and you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break in on him during his talk , but it 's up to you to convince them that it 's really important . Mmm , tell them you 're calling from Colorado or Texas  --  yeah , you 're calling from the Texas Cattle Show . They 'll get Messerschmidt if you make it strong enough . Your job then is to hold him on the phone for a few minutes . " Johnny frowned in concentration . " No , I need your help , of course . It 's really a three-man job . Let 's see . . . . Well , the best we can do is get him to the telephone and trust to Messerschmidt to hang on . Tell him the president of the show wants to talk to him about a lecture date , but he 's on a different wire and for Messerschmidt to hang on a minute . He 'll hang on for a little while , anyway . Then you rush here and follow my cue on whatever 's happening . Got it , now ? " A fine film of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He nodded dumbly and , putting down his two cartons beside the bulletin board , stumbled away like a man walking the last long mile . Johnny took a deep breath and entered the Edu-  | cational Building . It was a big auditorium , seating more than five hundred people . The seats were all filled and a number of people were standing at the rear and the sides of the room . At the far end was a raised platform . A halfdozen men were seated in the rear on folding chairs and in front of them a bald , stoop-shouldered man of about fifty was talking to the audience in a droning schoolroom tone . Johnny nudged a man beside him . " Old Messer-schmidt ? " The man nodded and followed it with a shrug . " Yeah , and he stinks . I guess I 've had about enough . " " Do n't go yet , " said Johnny . " Things are going to pick up in a minute . " On the platform a couple of the men were looking toward the wings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and put a finger to his lips . But the person in the wings was persistent and the man on the chair finally got up and tiptoed off the platform . He returned after a moment , leaned over the man who had been his neighbor and whispered . The other nodded vigorously and got up . He approached Professor Messerschmidt and spoke to him . Professor Messerschmidt listened , then frowned at his audience . Finally , he cleared his throat and announced in a strong voice :  | " I 'm sorry , ladies and gentlemen , but there 's a long distance telephone call for me from Washington . Umm , the Secretary of Agriculture . If you 'll excuse me a moment . . . . " By that time Johnny Fletcher was strolling down the aisle between two rows of seats . He walked carelessly , but with an air that suggested that if he did not own the place , he at least was the manager . When he came to the platform he smiled pleasantly at those on it and vaulted up lightly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ladies and gentlemen , " he said in a voice that carried to the farthest corner of the big room , " I 've been asked to say a few words during Professor Messerschmidt 's absence . As a matter of fact , I 'm going to give you a demonstration of something as soon as my assistant comes in . It 's something that each and everyone of you  --  at least the gentlemen ? are going to be vitally interested in . " He smiled and nodded to Sam Cragg who had just made his appearance at the rear of the hall . " This demonstration has to do with your health and vitality . It 's a privilege to have with me today a man who is undoubtedly the most perfect physical specimen in this country . You livestock breeders can understand that . And you can also understand what we 're going to show you here today . . . . Gentlemen and Ladies  --  Young Samson ! "  | Sam Cragg leaped lightly up to the platform , turned to face the audience and set down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he promptly peeled off his coat and dropped it on one of the cartons . He slipped off his necktie and began unbuttoning his shirt . A murmur ran through the audience and behind him , Johnny Fletcher could hear the whispering of the half-dozen men on the folding seats . Sam Cragg 's shirt came off revealing a powerful torso . Then Johnny Fletcher let go . " Gentlemen ! " he thundered . " And ladies , too . Have you ever in all your lives seen a more perfect body than you see here in Young Samson ? Look at his rippling muscles , his powerful physique . Have you ever seen anything like it  --  anywhere  --  at any time ? " Sam Cragg drew a deep breath ; at the same time he clenched his fists . Muscle leaped out in bunches on his arms . His chest  --  a truly magnificent one ? expanded almost six inches . He let the air out of his lungs , raised his arms over his head and , relaxed , shook his arms . Muscle rippled up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Young Samson is undoubtedly the strongest man any of you have ever seen . He is , in fact , the holder of the world 's record for tests of strength and is famous through  | this country as well as in Europe . Ile is sometimes called the Human Draft Horse ! What , gentlemen ? You 're skeptical ? You do n't think he 's as strong as I say ? Just a minute , before we get any further . We 'll prove it . Samson ! " Sam Cragg reached down and with a snap broke the heavy cord that tied one of the cartons . He flicked open the box and took out a canvas web belt , of the type known as an army belt . He handed it to Johnny who put it about Sam 's chest . He buckled it tightly in front . Then Johnny went on with his pitch . " Now , gentlemen , particularly you who have seen strong men ; you know that one of these belts is strong enough to lift a mule . Have you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course you have n't . Well ? Samson ! " Sam Cragg , alias Young Samson , let the air out of his lungs . Then he clenched his fists and slowly drew a deep breath . His chest expanded , the belt cut into his skin and flesh . There was a loud " pop " and the belt flew away from Sam . Johnny scooped it up from the platform . He held it aloft . " Look at it , gentlemen ! Look closely . Note that it did n't break at the buckle  --  but in the webbing . And notice , too , that it was n't cut or weakened in any manner . Look . . . . " He  | turned , exhibited the belt to the men on the row of seats and then tossed it to them . Sam Cragg tugged at his arm . " The chump 's coming back ! We 'd better scram . " Johnny pretended astonishment , shook his head and shrugged . " We 've got to bluff it through . Get the chain ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That is n't all , gentlemen ! Look ! . . . " Sam brought a six-foot length of chain from the opened carton . Johnny took it from him , dangled it in the air and carelessly smacked one end of it on the wooden platform . The chain gave off a satisfying ring of metal . Johnny roared : " Gentlemen , I see your expressions of amazement . You 're thinking : Surely he is n't going to try to break that chain ! Of course not . Good heavens , a horse could n't break it ! " He turned , however , and running the chain swiftly about Sam Cragg 's chest , linked it securely . Then he stepped back , grinning . " I 'm just joking , " he informed the crowd . " No human being could break that chain . I 'm just having a little fun . But . . . " He stooped and leaned forward in an earnest , confidential manner , took a sudden deep breath and thundered : " But suppose Young Samson did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of  | strength that would be . What a miracle ! . . . What ? you want to see a miracle performed ? You want to see Young Samson break that chain ? You think he might , he just barely might be able to do it ? " He shook his head sadly . Sam Cragg grinned foolishly , leaned over and mumbled in his ear . " Messerschmidt 's coming on .... " An expression of astonishment leaped into Johnny Fletcher 's eyes . He cried out : " He says he can do it ! He 's going to try . And I 'm going to let him . Why ? Because I know Young Samson better than any other person . I know that he 's the strongest living human . How do I know that ? Why  --  because I made him that ! " He paused dramatically , then assailed the audience again . " You think I 'm crazy ? You tell them , Samson , did I make you as strong as you are ? Were n't you a mere weakling when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hundred and thirty-five pounds ? Go ahead tell them ! " Sam Cragg bobbed his head . " Yah ! " he said . Then , out of the side of his mouth : " Get ready , Johnny ! " Voices behind Johnny Fletcher were chattering excitedly . Johnny waved backwards , impatiently , as if to silence the voices . Then he continued his harangue of the audience . " You see , Samson admits it . He gives me the  | sole credit for his amazing strength . How did I do it ? Ah , my friends , that is the secret ! I 'm going to tell you only that I , too , was a weakling once . I was consumptive , weighed ninety-nine pounds . The doctors gave me only three months to live . I was desperate . I did n't want to die . My miserable , sick body was precious to me . I wanted to get strong , be like other men . Gain the respect of my fellow men  --  women . For who loves a weakling ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a weakling . I weigh one hundred and seventy-three pounds and I can hold my own . No , I 'm not as strong as Young Samson . I do n't want to be . Why ? Because , back there , in those black days of despair I discovered a secret . You might call it the secret of life  --  vitality . I learned something the body needed , certain simple exercises , that send the life blood coursing through the veins ? that build up muscle , bone  --  life ! I learned that , ladies and gentlemen , and I applied it to myself . And then I met my friend here , a man almost as puny and weak as I was once myself . I told him about my simple exercises . He tried them  --  for he had nothing to lose . And the results are astonishing . I experimented some more , in fact , I used Young Samson as a human guinea pig . I devoted my entire life to building him up , making him the strongest human alive . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and  | some one tugged at his coat sleeve . " Please ! " said a voice , " who are you ? By what right have you come up here ? . . . " Johnny 's head swiveled about and he glared into the red face of Professor Messerschmidt . " Quiet , please ! " he hissed . He took a deep breath and turned back to his audience . He knew he had them . They were sitting on the edges of their chairs , spellbound by his voice and the suspense of waiting for Sam Cragg to break the chain about his chest . He said : " I achieved my goal . With my simple , secret exercises I built up the strongest living human . And then , my friends , it came to me suddenly that I had no right to withhold my secret from the world . It was my duty , my duty to humanity to let other men , other weaklings become well and strong  --  and full of vitality . " He spoke faster now , for the boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had long enough to compare notes and realize that he was an intruder . They were about to do something about it . Johnny thundered his closing address : " And so , gentlemen , I wrote down these secrets of strength , the simple ordinary exercises that Young Samson did to become so strong . I compiled them , had them illustrated and published in a book . In just a moment I 'm going to permit you to acquire one of these books . And I 'm not going to charge you fifty dollars  | for it , nor even twenty-five or fifteen and God knows that would be little enough to pay for such a secret . No , my friends , it 's my duty to make these books available to every one and that 's why I 'm going to practically give them away  --  asking just enough to pay for the cost of the printing and binding . Wait ? do n't go away ! " The mention of money had broken the spell . It always does . Johnny had to clinch things , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But do n't buy ! Do n't part with a cent , until you see the most amazing , stupendous feat of strength that has even been performed in public or private . Watch young Samson , the strongest living human , break that chain about his chest  --  those links of solid iron . Young Samson , are you ready ? " Sam was watching the men behind Johnny . Professor Messerschmidt and two of the boldest were just stepping forward . Sam showed his teeth and growled , " Ahrr ! " The trio halted . Sam turned to the audience , spread his feet apart , placed them firmly on the platform , then lowered himself to a crouch and deflated his chest . " Watch him now ! " cried Johnny Fletcher . Slowly , a half inch at a time , Samson came up from his crouch . He drew in his breath , his face  | turned red from tremendous exertion , he clenched his fists , and expanded his breath . The chain became taut , cut into his flesh . And then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snapped and the chain flew out into space , dropping on the main floor , less than a foot from the front row of seats . It made a loud clank . A roar went up in the audience . The committee on the platform began milling excitedly , but Sam Cragg and Johnny Fletcher paid no attention to them . Sam was scooping up his coat , shirt , and tie , plus one carton of books . Johnny was tearing open the second carton . Together , then , they jumped from the platform and attacked the crowd below . " Here it is ! " Johnny yelled . " The book that tells you  --  even the weakest of you  --  how to become strong . The book containing the secret exercises that enabled Young Samson to break that sturdy belt , that chain of solid iron . Only $2.95 ! " He assailed the crowd , thrust books at weak men , strong men , boys ; he browbeat them , hurling challenges and taunts alike . Sam Cragg worked the outskirts of the crowd , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A young girl giggled , then timidly thrust white fingers against Sam 's torso . Instantly other girls began crowding around . Sam  | did n't mind . Men who saw the admiration of the fair sex for a brawny man , bought books . There was n't a better book salesman in the country than Johnny Fletcher when he was right . And he was right , today . Before the policemen  --  summoned by the members of the committee  --  came , he had sold the entire contents of his own carton of books and there remained but a layer in the bottom of Sam 's . There were two policemen . With them was a man wearing a silk badge , on which was printed in gold , Secretary . " Here , you ! " the man with the badge cried . " What 's going on here ? " " I 've been selling a few books , " Johnny replied , laconically . " What 's wrong with that ? You have n't heard any squawks , have you ? " The secretary was shocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books , here ? " he screamed . Johnny clucked his tongue against the roof of his mouth . " Yep , here . And no one 's complaining , either . Look at those people who bought . Are n't they contented and happy with their fine purchase ? ... " " But  --  but you have n't any license to sell books ? " howled the man with the badge . " Not here ! " " License ? " said Johnny . " Why do I need a license ? "  | The secretary glanced helplessly at his police escort . Perspiration streamed down his face . " I 'm Evans  --  secretary of the Cattle Congress . You ca n't sell books on these grounds without a license . And you ca n't sell anything in here .... " " Oh , but I did ! " exclaimed Johnny indignantly . " And what 's more I 've worked fairs and exhibitions all over this country and have never been compelled to pay a fee . " Which was not exactly true . He did not often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not ask for them ; it was because he usually talked them out of it . But there was a determined glint in Evans ' eyes . This thing was too incredible to let pass , yet the only thing he could think of on the spur of the moment was the license fee . He concentrated on that . " You 'll pay one hundred dollars or you 'll sell no more books on these grounds , " he said nastily . " A hundred dollars ! Why I wo n't make a hundred dollars all week . " " All week ? You 're figuring on keeping this up all week ? I think the concession price then should not be less than two hundred  --  and you 'll only work outside in the open . Not in any buildings ! " " Two hundred ? " Johnny groaned . " Why you only charge the sheetwriters twenty-five ! " " They do n't make as much commotion as you do . "  | Mr. Evans was a bargainer of the old school . He did not insist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quotation for some time . Only when Johnny threatened to leave the grounds altogether did Mr. Evans shade his price to ninety dollars . And then he was licked . A man who made a concession to Johnny Fletcher never had a chance . Johnny hammered him down , to fifty dollars , to forty and finally with a bonus of a book , entitled : EVERY MAN A SAMSON plus a sales talk , he closed the deal for twenty-five dollars . Mr. Evans gave him a receipt . By that time there were less than fifty of the five hundred people remaining in the auditorium . Upon the platform Professor Messerschmidt and colleagues were figuratively tearing their hair . Johnny waved farewell to them . " Old Messy could n't have held his audience anyway , " he chuckled to Sam Cragg . Sam smacked his lips . " I aged ten years during that , Johnny . " Johnny grinned . " Well , it was close , but we got away with it . Put these few books back into the car and then look up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asking him to rush us a shipment of books . About five hundred . From the looks of things we 're going to need them before the week is up . Uh . . . you might say , too , that we 'll send  | him a substantial check on account , at the end of the week . " " On account of what ? " " On account of we owe him so much . Do n't worry . Our credit 's still good with Mort . We 've always paid him in the long run . " He walked abruptly away from Sam . He headed for the poultry building and pretended not to hear Sam yelling after him .  | Chapter Eight Just inside the poultry building , he met Jessie Thompson . She gave him a mock frown . " The way you took over that meeting and bulldozed those people . I saw it all . So that 's how you make your living ! " " Yep , " said Johnny , feeling good because there was money in his pocket . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . Would you believe that I took almost two hundred dollars from that crowd in those few minutes ? " " I believe it . I was watching . But tell me  --  how do you do it ? " " Do what ? " " Why , those feats of strength ? Surely , your friend ca n't break a thick chain like he did out there ? " Johnny chuckled . " You saw him do it , did n't you ? " " Yes , but there must be a trick to it . Is the chain filed almost through ? " " Nope . I ca n't tell you . Professional secret , you  | know . But look , tell me about those exhibitor friends of yours  --  Mr. and Mrs. Wallace Erb ? " " An interesting couple , are n't they ? I 've known them for years . They breed foxes on a rather large scale . Right here , near Cedar City . Mrs. Erb is a good deal younger than her husband . " " I know . And she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I saw her sizing up Sam . " Jessie Thompson shook her head . " Mr. Erb 's a very jealous man . " " Kind of sour , too , on things in general . " " Oh , yes . But then , you know his history , of course ! " " History ? No , I do n't know it . The name 's somehow familiar , but I do n't place it . " " He 's the Wallace Erb . You remember  --  the famous Chester Erb case ? The papers mention something about it now and then , even today . Although it happened twenty years ago . " Johnny frowned . " Chester Erb . . . mmm ! That name 's more familiar than Wallace Erb . Let 's see , it was a murder case , was n't it ? " " No . A kidnaping . Well , not exactly a kidnaping . At least they never knew . Chester Erb just disappeared . " The memory grooves clicked in Johnny 's brain . " Yes , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece about it in a magazine only about a year ago .  | Something about famous mysteries . This Chester Erb was just a kid , thirteen or fourteen . He was coming home from school . He left some schoolmates on the corner , near his house . . . and that was the last that was ever seen of him . He never reached home . " " That 's right , " Jessie Thompson said . " The family was quite wealthy and thought he had been kidnaped for ransom . But no ransom was ever demanded . And no word was ever heard of young Chester . The family employed detectives for years . Chester Erb , Senior , it was reported , spent a million dollars searching for his son . Young Chester 's disappearance broke his mother 's heart . She died within a year . Chester , Senior , lived five years , but he practically retired from business after his son 's disappearance . " Johnny nodded , thoughtfully . " And his brother , Wallace Erb , inherited everything . Except a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in case he should ever turn up . Hmm , so this Wallace Erb is that Erb . He moved out here from Chicago . " " Oh yes , years ago . He 's been breeding foxes for at least ten years . Started as a rich man 's hobby , but he 's gradually built up to the point , where he 's one of the largest breeders in the country . Making money at it , too . " " He never amounted to much , though , until he  | inherited his brother 's money . " Johnny shook his head . " I guess I 'm a skeptic . The first thing that pops into my mind is ? " " That Wallace Erb did away with his young nephew ? Well , the police had that idea , too . Of course they did n't come right out with it , but I understand , from reading those old accounts  --  for , of course this all happened when I was quite young ? that they investigated Wallace Erb about as thoroughly as anyone was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a perfect alibi , before Chester 's disappearance , during it  --  and afterwards . " " Maybe the kid just got a notion to run away from home . Lots of kids do that . Even thirteen- and fourteen-year-olds . " Jessie Thompson shook her head . " Why should Chester Erb have rum away from home ? His father was a millionaire . He had everything a kid could want . He was the apple of his father 's eye .... " " Maybe they made young Chester eat porridge for breakfast and he did n't like porridge , " Johnny suggested , facetiously . " Porridge ! " sniffed Jessie Thompson . " Jessie ! " exclaimed a man , coming up from the rear of the poultry building . " I 've been looking for you . " He was a tall , young man of about thirty , lean  | and well-built and wore a blue striped suit and Homburg hat . " Hal ! " said Jessie Thompson . " I was just going to the hotel to see if you had n't got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Could n't get a train until after midnight . " Hal Thompson looked over his sister 's head at Johnny Fletcher . " Oh , " said Jessie Thompson . " This is Mr. Fletcher . My brother , Hal . " Johnny shook hands with the young fox breeder . Thompson had a firm grip . " Have you read the papers , Hal ? " Jessie asked , then . Hal Thompson frowned . " How could I miss them . Orpington ! And I saw your name , too , Jessie . And by the way . . . . Fletcher , is n't your name familiar ? " " It was my room , Thompson , " said Johnny . " Your sister 's the one who snitched ? " " Snitched ? " cried Jessie . " What would you do if you heard a shot in the room next to yours and you were all alone in a strange hotel ? " Hal Thompson looked from his sister to Johnny . It was apparent that he was puzzled by the familiarity between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at the young vixen ? It seems to me she 's a little off her feed . "  | The comment was so blunt that even Johnny Fletcher , thick-skinned as he was , knew that he was n't wanted . He said : " Nice meeting you , Mr. Thompson . I 'll see you around . " " Yes . " Jessie Thompson slipped her hand under her brother 's arm , but as they walked off she looked back at Johnny and smiled . Johnny grinned at her . He loafed for a few minutes , observing some strange-looking Japanese chickens with tails three feet long . Then , as he was turning away , some one tapped him on the shoulder . It was No-Dice Bobby Coons . " Hi , Johnny Fletcher ! " the little gambler greeted him . " Do n't come up on me like that , " Johnny snapped . " I usually swing when I 'm surprised . You would n't want to get a clout on the jaw , would you ? " " Say , but you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you that I 'll give you a chance to win your money back , tonight . " " How do you know I 've got any money ? " No-Dice showed yellowed teeth in what he thought was a smile . " Saw you working out there . Not bad . I did n't think there were that many umpchays. "  | " I 'd be an umpchay if I got into a crap game against you with any amount of money on me . " No-Dice looked injured . " What the hell , Fletcher . I play honest . No one 's ever accused me of stacking dice . I 'll even use a dice cup tonight . " " Do n't wait up for me , No-Dice . " No-Dice shrugged . " Okay , it 's your money . Going to be a good game , though . I got a big fox and fur man lined up . " " So that 's why you 've been snooping around here ! Hustling up suckers . Who 's the sap ? " " Fella named Erb . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolling in sugar . " " Wallace Erb ? He 's coming into your crap game ? " " Sure , why not ? They do n't see much action around a hick town like this . The game 's strictly high-class tonight ; no sheetwriters and punks . " " Except you . " " Nuts to you , Fletcher . " Indignantly , No-Dice stalked off . Johnny watched him go through the big double doors and wondered idly what No-Dice did with all the money he undoubtedly won in crap games and other games of chance , in all of which he was adept . Down by the turkeys , Detective Holtznagle was idling about . Johnny Fletcher had completely forgotten him .  | Johnny approached him . " Hello , Copper . " Detective Holtznagle pretended surprise . " Me ? " " What the hell , you think I 've forgotten you since last night ? You 're shadowing me , are n't you ? " A foolish grin spread across the detective 's broad face . " The lieutenant said to sort of keep an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , you know . " " Where is Lieutenant Cantrell ? " " He went back to town . Got a call from the chief . " " Something to do with the Orpington affair ? " " I would n't know . The lieutenant do n't tell me everything . Say . . . . Mr. Fletcher . " " Yes ? " Detective Holtznagle reached sheepishly for his hip pocket . Johnny , half expecting him to draw out a gun or a pair of handcuffs gasped when Holtznagle brought out  --  a copy of EVERY MAN A SAMSON . " This here book , " Holtznagle said . " Is it really as good as you said it was ? " Johnny took a deep breath , then leaned forward and tapped Detective Holtznagle on his ample bosom . " Sergeant , you read that book from cover to cover . And then , when you finish . . . " " What then ? " " Read it again ! " Johnny walked off , leaving Detective Holtznagle with his mouth open .  | In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having a conclave of some sort . Both Thompsons and both Erbs were in the huddle , as was also Ben Longstreet , the monkey-faced fox breeder and another man . The latter was a squat , broad-shouldered man , wearing a derby hat and a long duster that dragged in the tanbark floor covering . He had a thin , nickelplated rod in his hand and was gesturing with it as he spoke in a deep , bass voice : " They let me see the fox and I tell you , it was the finest young silver I ever saw in my life . It would have beaten anything in this show . " Ben Longstreet said in a whining tone , " I told you , Orpington was a crook . He bought that fox from Duchaine up in Prince Edward Island . " " How can you be so sure ? " Hal Thompson demanded . " Because Duchaine told me . I wrote to him . " The squat man with the derby and the nickelplated rod , rumbled : " Duchaine would n't tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Canadian National three years ago and he struck me as a pretty cagey sort of fellow . One of those French Canucks . " Longstreet 's beady little eyes glittered . " He did n't tell me in so many words ; naturally , he would n't . But I  --  well , I wrote to him and asked for  | a price on a young pup . Told him I wanted it for this show . He wrote back and said he could n't give me a quotation , not for this show , because he 'd already sold an entry for it . " " So you were going to buy an animal from Duchaine ! " Jessie Thompson exclaimed , witheringly . " No , " said Ben Longstreet , doggedly . " I was n't . But I wanted to know if any one else was . That 's why I wrote to Duchaine . I 've got a mighty fine pup here myself and I just wanted to know what sort of competition I was up against . . . . " Wallace Erb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I wrote to Duchaine myself . And I got the same answer as Longstreet . " Longstreet turned on Erb . " You , Erb ? Why you got five-six thousand animals to pick from . " " Sure , " replied Erb easily . " But why kid ourselves ? Those Canadian breeders can beat us hands down , every time . It 's colder up there and the fur gets thicker . Besides , they 've been inbreeding for much longer than we have . " Johnny Fletcher suddenly lost interest in the fox argument . Mrs. Wallace Erb had moved carelessly away from the group , and at a safe distance had increased her pace . She was now rounding the row of coops and coming toward Johnny . She gave him the full benefit of her mascaraed orbs . " Hello , Mr. Fletcher . The men are arguing  | about foxes and , personally , it 's very boring . Do n't you think so ? " " I do . I was just about to step outside and have a  --  a cup of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Why , I 'd be delighted . Except that I 'd rather have a cocktail . There 's a cafe on the grounds , somewhere . And , Mr. Fletcher , my name 's Patricia . Patsy to my friends . " " Call me Johnny . . . Patsy ! " She laughed merrily and took his arm . Johnny walked away quickly , with her , lest the jealous Mr. Erb notice his wife 's absence and forestall what promised to be an interesting half hour or so . They left the large building and Patsy Erb led the way unerringly toward a building , in which a neat , little cocktail lounge was installed . They sat down in a booth and a waiter came to take their order . " A daiquiri , " Patsy Erb said . " No , make it a martini . " " Two , " Johnny said . Patsy Erb put her elbows on the table and leaned forward . " You 're a rather amazing person , Johnny Fletcher , " she said . " Oh , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ odd word ! " " You never heard it before . . . in New York ? " " How 'd you know I 'm from New York ? " Johnny winked at her . " You do n't look like a  | small-town girl . Do n't tell me , now  --  you were in the theater , were n't you ? " Patsy Erb exclaimed . " Why . . . did you ever see me ? " " No . " " Then how do you know ? " His eyes admired her frankly . " Where else would you be in New York ? What was it , The Follies ? " " No . The Tip Top Club , on 52nd Street . That 's where I met Erb  --  my husband . You know , I spotted you as being from the big town . " " That so ? How do you like small-town life , after 52nd Street ? " Her rouged lips pouted . " I like it fine ! " " I 'll bet ! What do you do for fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bridge at the weekly meeting of the Ladies Club ? " " Stop it , Johnny Fletcher ! " she cried . " Stop it , or you 'll have me bawling . " The arrival of the martinis prevented the tears . She downed her own drink in two gulps and promptly ordered another . Johnny had to hurry with his drink , to keep her company . He said , then : " But you did n't have five thousand silver foxes in New York . Or a flock of stocks and bonds . " She sighed : " Would I have left the Tip Top for coffee and cakes ? I like champagne and . . . " one  | hand brushed her silver fox cape , " and silver foxes . Although I like them better in coats , than on the hoof . " " What business is your husband in ? " Johnny asked carelessly . " Besides raising foxes , I mean ? " " None . And he does n't raise the foxes , himself . There 're about a dozen men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 'll have to come out and see the place . It 's real money . And that 's why I stick to it . " " Oh , it 's like that . " " Wally is thirty years older than I am . " " I guess he is , at that . Say . . . is n't he the Wallace Erb of the Chester Erb case ? " She shook her head in annoyance . " We never talk about that . Wally does n't like it . " " But Wally is n't here . And I 'm curious . I read about it in a magazine a while ago . Famous Disappearances , you know . . . . " " Yes , yes , I 've heard all about it . The kid ran away from home and because his father had a lot of money , the newspapers made a big fuss about it . If it 'd been some poor kid , you 'd never have heard of it . " " Probably not . But that 's what arouses my curiosity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from home ? " " Rich people quarrel , too . Probably more than the poor , because they have n't anything else to do .  | From what Wally 's told me , his brother was n't any doting father . He used the old strap plenty . Wally said the kid positively hated his father . " " Umm , " said Johnny . " That 's a new angle . I guess the papers were afraid to print that . Libel . Maybe the kid did run off . But why did n't he show up later ? Especially , after his father died and all that money was waiting for him . " " Maybe he did n't know about it . Maybe he . . . got sick and died in the meantime . Anyway , why should we worry about it ? I 'd like another cocktail and then I 've got to get back . Wally 's probably having catfits . " They drank the third martini and then Johnny paid the check . They got up to leave the place , but before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holtznagle came in . Behind him was Lieutenant Cantrell and a heavy-set man with a walrus mustache . " Ow , " said Johnny . Walrus Mustache pointed a thick finger at Johnny . " That 's him , Chief . There was another guy with him , but this is the one that did all the talking . " Lieutenant Cantrell 's teeth showed in a wolfish grin . " Fletcher , this is the bartender at the Main Street Cocktail Lounge . He 's just identified you as  | a man who propositioned Alfred Orpington to share a hotel room last night . " " Well , " said Johnny . " I 've only one thing to say . That the beer they sell at the Main Street Cocktail Lounge is  --  lousy ! " He turned to Patricia Erb . " Will you excuse me , Mrs. Erb ? I think Lieutenant Cantrell has something he wants to show me down at headquarters . A rubber hose ! "  | Chapter Nine Chief of Police Fleishacker was a political appointee . He was short , fat and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at home behind the counter of a meat market , than head of a metropolitan police department . He panted to Johnny Fletcher , " You admit then that you enticed this Orpington to your hotel room ? " Johnny sighed , wearily . " You make it sound like I was a Bluebeard . The dope from the saloon up the street can tell you the man came into the place , complaining about not being able to find a hotel room . That 's true ; Cedar City 's got no business putting on a show like the Cattle Congress and getting thousands of people to come here , when they have n't got sufficient accommodations . " Civic pride caused the chief 's face to redden with threatening apoplexy . " Say , you got no call to talk like that about this town . It 's a damn good place to live . We 're proud of Cedar City . " " No doubt . All right , I like Cedar City . I liked it last night . And I felt sorry for this little chap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Carter-  | Lambert Hotel . We offered to let Orpington sleep in one bed , while we doubled up in the other . That 's all there 's to it . " Lieutenant Cantrell cut in : " No , it is n't . Why would you ask a perfect stranger , with a fox , to share your room . You must have had some reason . Maybe you were counting on rolling him ? " " How much money did he have on him when you found him ? " " About four hundred dollars . You probably did n't get a chance to frisk him . " Johnny said , doggedly : " All right , I 'll tell you the whole story . My friend and I were broke . We hit this town with exactly twenty cents between us . We went to the Main Street Cocktail Lounge , because we could get a free lunch with a glass of beer . So help me , that 's the truth . Then this Orpington came along with his beef about not being able to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price . . . . Did you ever try to make a full meal on hors d'oeuvres ? " " I never eat them , " said Lieutenant Cantrell , virtuously . " Lucky man . Well , you 've got to eat an awful lot of hors d'oeuvres to fill up an empty stomach . And the bartender kept a close watch . So it looked like a nice break all around . We share our room with Orpington and he pays the tariff . . . in advance ! "  | " But you left the cocktail lounge and went straight to the hotel . " " Oh , no ! We left Orpington outside . We gave him the key to our room and told him to go up . Sam and I beat it to the Greasy Spoon , to get some heavy food . " " The restaurant across the street from the hotel ? Nick Demetrios ' place ? " " Yes . Why do n't you check up with Nick ? " " I will . Also with Miss Thompson , who had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I talked to her this morning . You saw me . She heard only one shot . " Lieutenant Cantrell looked worried . " That 's what she said . The shots must have come close together , sounded like one . " " Hey ! " cried Johnny , in alarm . " Do n't go putting such ideas into her head . Orpington was killed in the bathroom , the fox in the bedroom . There must have been a couple of seconds between the shots . " " Maybe so , but the Thompson girl was alone in her room . She got scared stiff when she heard the shot next door . It 's quite possible she was too excited to hear the second shot . " " No , " said Johnny . " She could n't get that excited . " A buzzer whirred on the chief 's desk and he  | picked up his telephone . He listened a moment , then said : " Bring her in . " He hung up the receiver . " Miss Thompson 's here , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No . Let this man stay . " A uniformed policeman brought in Jessie Thompson . Lieutenant Cantrell crossed the room and whispered a moment in the policeman 's ear . Then he returned . Jessie Thompson glanced searchingly at Johnny Fletcher . He nodded , assuringly . She turned then , to Lieutenant Cantrell . " Well , Lieutenant , what can I do for you ? " " Why , we just wanted you to substantiate a point or two . This is Chief Fleishacker , Miss Thompson . " The chief beamed . " The fact is , Miss Thompson , there are some discrepancies in this man 's story . You heard two shots at the hotel last night , did n't you ? Two shots , close together ? " " Oh , no ! " exclaimed Jessie Thompson , " only one shot . " Johnny nodded approval . Lieutenant Cantrell stepped around Jessie Thompson so he was between her and the chief . " I want you to think that over , Miss Thompson . Carefully . Is n't it quite possible that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it sounded like only one . . or perhaps the echo of the first ? "  | " No . Positively not . There was only one shot and that was fired several minutes after Mr. Fletcher and his friend left the room . " Consternation spread across Cantrell 's face . " Wait a minute ! " he cried . " You could n't possibly have known they left the room . I mean . . . well , how do you know they left the room ? " " Why , I heard them . They were quite noisy about it . Slammed the door . " Cantrell shot an angry glance at Johnny Fletcher who was grinning widely at the detective 's discomfiture . " How do you know it was them ? " " I heard their voices . They were talking , then the door slammed and there were several minutes of complete silence , finally broken by the sound of the revolver shot . " Cantrell shook his head unhappily . " But you did n't hear anything ? No one opening the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No . " " I 'll play these , " said Johnny Fletcher . Cantrell bared his teeth . " I do n't like it . None at all . There were two shots fired , because we found two bullets , one in Orpington and one in the fox . " " Look at it this way , Lieutenant , " said Johnny . " A half hour after we gave Orpington the key to our room , we went in ourselves . Orpington was already dead , lying in the bathroom . We thought his dog  | had killed him and we wanted to catch the brute . He was under the bed , only he was n't a dog , but a fox . Not having much experience with man-eating foxes , Sam Cragg and I beat it out of the room . Our friend , Mike Seymour , across the hall , opened his door just then , to take a bottle of whisky a bellboy was bringing him . We went into his room and got involved in that crap game . Remember , Lieutenant ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . yes ; yes , go on . " " Well , we were shooting craps and arguing . There was a lot of money down and ? " " You can skip that ! " " So this fellow had the dice and I faded part of the bet . He threw them out and I hollered , No dice ! ' " " Get on with it ! " snarled Cantrell . " I 'm trying to . But I 've got to tell you about this crap game , which you interrupted , you know . . . . " " Ho ! " said Chief of Police Fleishacker . " You broke up a dice game , Lieutenant ? You did n't tell me anything about that . " " It was n't anything , " Cantrell said , hastily . " Go on with your story , Fletcher . " " Well , then just after he threw a seven , you and Detective Holtznagle broke in and grabbed all the money ? "  | " What ? " exclaimed the chief . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll say he did ! " Johnny cried . " All the money in sight . Over a hundred ? " " Sixteen dollars and thirty-five cents ! " Cantrell howled . " That 's all there was , Chief . Honest ! " Chief Fleishacker looked coldly at Cantrell . " We 'll go into that later , Cantrell . The idea ! Go on with your story , Mr. Fletcher . " " Well , that 's about all there 's to it . After the lieutenant confiscated all the money in sight , he took us back to Room 515 . " " So ? " " Why , that 's all , Chief . I was just trying to prove that there was a considerable lapse of time between the slam of the door  --  which Miss Thompson reported  --  and when Lieutenant Cantrell broke up the crap game . Plenty of time ? " " Five minutes ! " snarled Cantrell . " And it took us almost that long to get over . " " Oh , no ! " cried Johnny Fletcher . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " May I say something ? " interrupted Jessie Thompson . " Of course , " the chief said quickly . " What is it  --  Miss Thompson ? " " Why , it 's just that I believe Mr. Fletcher . You see , after I telephoned the desk I listened carefully .  | It was exactly six minutes before Lieutenant Cantrell brought Mr. Fletcher back to his room . I should say therefore that approximately eleven minutes had expired during the time I heard the door slam and Lieutenant Cantrell brought Mr. Fletcher back to Room 515 . " Cantrell said , sourly : " Then it was five minutes after the door slammed before the shot was fired ? You said only a minute or two , before . " " That was merely a general statement . Meaning , just a little while . Actually , it was between three and four minutes . And then it was another minute or so before I telephoned downstairs . " " Why  --  I mean , why did you wait a minute or so ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment . Frightened , too . After all , the instant you hear a gun fired you do n't just immediately rush to a telephone and call the police , do you ? " " I would ! " snapped Cantrell . Chief Fleishacker said , " Harumph ! Perhaps you would , Lieutenant . But Miss Thompson 's a woman . A girl . . . . Naturally , she would n't react so quickly . " Jessie Thompson turned the full force of her three hundred candle-power eyes upon the chief . " Of course not , Chief ! " she said , accenting her words with a tantalizing smile .  | " Quite so , Miss Thompson . Well , I guess that clears everything up , does n't it ? " " No , " said Cantrell . " It complicates them even more . There 're the woman 's fingerprints ? " Jessie Thompson said : " Is it all right if I go , Chief ? " " Yeah , sure . Okay , Lieutenant ? " Cantrell nodded reluctantly . " I guess so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , good-bye then . You 've been very nice ? both of you ! " Jessie smiled at the chief , whose eyes rolled in his fat face . Johnny Fletcher fell into step beside Jessie Thompson , but Cantrell snarled at him : " Who said you could go , Fletcher ? " " Why , it 's all right , is n't it ? Miss Thompson gave me an alibi , you know . " " Just the same you stay here . I want to question you about the woman 's fingerprints . . . . " " Good-bye , all ! " said Jessie Thompson and went out , quickly . Johnny frowned as the door swung shut . Then he sighed and turned back to Cantrell . " I do n't know anything about any woman 's fingerprints , Lieutenant , " he said . " Where were they ? On the bathroom door ? " " The dog valise ! Along with your friend 's . By the way , he 's downstairs . We picked him up and his prints matched a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sure , they would . You probably found mine on there , too . We carried Orpington 's bag a little way for him . " " Did you ? Very neat . But this woman ? " " Have I got her ? " Johnny asked , testily . " You did n't see any woman touch this bag ? " " Of course not . " " That seems obvious , Lieutenant , " the chief offered . " Miss Thompson gave Mr. Fletcher an alibi , so I do n't think we should hold him . " " I do n't agree with you , Chief . I think we should hold him . For a day or two anyway . . . . " " On what charge ? " Johnny snapped . " Vagrancy . You admitted yourself you spent your last twenty cents at the cocktail lounge ? " " That was yesterday . Look . . . . " Johnny 's hand dove into a pocket and came out with a fistful of bills . " Does this look like I were a vag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Cantrell demanded . " I earned it . At the fairgrounds this morning . Did n't your stoo  --  I mean , Detective Holtznagle  --  tell you I sold a flock of books ? . . . " " You never got all that money selling books in those few minutes ! " " Oh , did n't I ? You watch the next time I put on a pitch . If I do n't take in a hundred dollars you can have the money , Lieutenant .... "  | The chief cleared his throat . " Speaking of money , Lieutenant ; about that dice game . . . . " Cantrell surrendered , helplessly . " Beat it , Fletcher . For God 's sake , beat it ! " " And my friend , Sam Cragg ? " Cantrell strode to the door and tore it open . " Louie ! Turn loose that bum I jugged an hour ago . Cragg or Bagg or whatever his name is . " " Thanks , Captain ! " grinned Johnny . " And I wish you  --  luck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and down , pantomiming a crapshooter . Then he ducked out . Sam Cragg was turned loose a few minutes later . He joined Johnny Fletcher outside the police station . " What a crummy jail they 've got in this town ! " he exclaimed . " Let it be a lesson to you , Sam ! " " To me ? Say , I did n't get us into this mess . It was you , picking up Orpington . Trying one of your stunts . Now you blame me . " " Tut-tut , Sam . I got you out of it , did n't I ? And we 've money in our pockets again . Which reminds me , as long as we 're here , we might as well settle this room business at the hotel . " The day clerk at the Carter-Lambert had an Adolphe Menjou mustache . He looked very bored when Johnny braced him . " Yes , Voecks told me . But I 'm sorry , we 've a waiting list and ? "  | " Waiting list , hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you let a man walk into it and get killed . . . . " " The room 's been cleaned , " said the clerk . " Furthermore , I could have rented it a half dozen times this morning . So if you do n't want it . . . " Johnny glowered at the clerk . " I 'll take it . Give me our key . . , and what 's that in our box ? " The clerk reached for the pigeonhole and gave Johnny a tagged key and a slip of paper . Johnny looked at the slip of paper . It was a telephone charge slip . He blinked at it . " Say , what 's the idea ? I have n't made any phone calls .... " " You must have , " insisted the clerk . " Our operator is very careful . " " Come to think of it , " Johnny said , " I did make a telephone call . " " No , Johnny ? " began Sam Cragg , but Johnny shoved his elbow into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Sam , " he whispered , tensely . " This call  --  Orpington must have made it . See , it 's dated yesterday and there 's the number , Waterloo 2629 ! Hold everything ! . . . " He stepped swiftly to a battery of phone booths and entered one . He dropped a nickel in the slot  | and when the operator answered , said : " I want Waterloo 2629 . " The phone buzzed and then a man 's voice said : " Waterloo 2629 . " Johnny said loudly : " Hello ? Waterloo 2629 ? Who is this speaking ? " " Who is this calling ? " the voice demanded . " This is Cedar City calling , " Johnny shouted . " Who is this talking ? " " I 'm sorry , " was the reply , " there 's no one home . If you wish to leave a message . . . " ' Johnny made a stab in the dark . " Yes . Tell Mr. Erb that Alfred called ! " " Mr. Alfred ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , thanks ! " Johnny slammed the receiver on the hook and shoved open the narrow door of the booth ; " Wallace Erb ! " he said to Sam Cragg . " Orpington called him last night . " " You talked to Erb now ? " " No . Some flunky answered and he would n't let on whose number it was . I took a chance , figuring there would n't be many people around this- neck of the woods having a butler . It worked . This number is Erb 's .... " Sam 's face registered heavy thought . " I do n't get it , Johnny . Why would Orpington call Wallace Erb from our telephone ? "  | " How do I know ? But it 's a clew . He did call him , though . So he must have known him . And it 's the first break we 've had on this case . Come on , let 's get back to the grounds . You 've got the bus outside ? " " No , of course not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wagon . " " Then we 've got to take a taxi back . And it 's after three already . By the way , did you get yourself something to eat ? " " I grabbed a sandwich when I went to send that telegram . " " Trust you to catch your meals , " growled Johnny . " All I 've had all day were three dry martinis . " He chuckled at the memory . " I had them with Mrs. Erb , Sam . " Sam brightened . " Say , she 's a pip , ai n't she ? " " Oh-oh ! So you went for her , Sam . Look , I hate to blight love 's young dream , but I understand her husband is very jealous . " " That old goat ! What the hell , does he think she married him for love ? Why , he 's sixty if he 's a day . And the kid 's only about twenty-two , twenty-three .... " " Pull those two ages together a little , Sam . Patricia 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he looks . It 's his disposition . " " Well , anyway , she 's my idea of a woman ,  | Johnny . Lots of  --  of vitality , if you know what I mean . " " I do n't think I do . But let 's skip it , eh ? " Outside the hotel , they flagged a taxi and rode out to the fairgrounds . Johnny gave the ticket sellers a break and purchased two tickets . " I should have made the secretary slip us a couple of Annie Oakleys , " he grumbled . In the poultry building , Lord Mike , the sheetwriter , was shaking hands with an elderly farmer and stowing away a bill with his free hand . Johnny said , " Tsk , tsk ! " as they passed . Back in the fox aisle the little man in the smock and derby was poking his nickel-plated rod at various foxes , annoying them so one or two tried to break through the wire . Ben Longstreet was hovering near , watching the proceedings with an anxious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no sign . " Is that the judge ? " Johnny asked of Longstreet . The living proof of Darwin 's theory nodded . " Judge Orrin . But if you ask me , he 's in the wrong part of the show . He ought to be up there , judging those damned chickens . Look at him ! " Judge Orrin had stepped back from a cage and was scowling at it . Then he leaned forward and with a stub of a pencil made a check mark on the coop tag .  | " My young vixen ! " exclaimed Longstreet , seethingly . " He 's setting her down . Damn him , I 've got a good notion to ? " " Let me do it ! " said Johnny . Winking at Longstreet he moved casually down the aisle . He stopped beside Judge Orrin and smacked his lips . " What an elegant little animal that is ! " he said , enthusiastically . Judge Orrin 's head jerked sidewards . " You showing here ? " " Showing ? No . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh ! You 're from  --  Canada ? I 'm Judge Orrin , you 've probably heard of me . " Johnny wrinkled his face . " Umm , ca n't say that I have . But then  --  well , you know . We get rather large entries up in  --  up in British Columbia ! " " British Columbia . Say , you would n't be Judge ... Judge ... " " Fletcher . Yes . Just happened to be visiting in the States and heard that you were having a little show here . . . . " " We consider this a pretty good show , " Judge Orrin cut in , frowning . " Naturally , your British Columbia breeders ? " " Yes , of course . But I will say that 's an- elegant little fox , here ! " Judge Orrin stabbed through the bars with his  | judging stick and poked the vixen in the ribs so she almost broke through the wire , in her terror . Then he put another check mark on the coop tag . Johnny heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a different system in this country , " Johnny said . " We leave the card clean for the good ones . " Judge Orrin snorted . " This one good ? Bah ! " He made another mark on the tag . Johnny fled  --  away from Ben Longstreet.  | Chapter Ten Sam Cragg swallowed the last of his second cup of coffee and sighed in absolute contentment . " What 's on the program tonight , Johnny ? " " Why , they 've got a nice double feature up the street , Sam . And Bingo . How does that strike you ? " " Swell , Johnny . We 'll take it in and then get a good night 's sleep . " " Not me , Sam . You 're going to the movies alone . " " Huh ? What 's the idea ? You are n't thinking of ? " " I 've got a little matter to attend to . Take me a couple of hours . It would n't interest you . " " How do you know it would n't ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of . But not with a woman . I thought I 'd have a little chat with Wallace Erb , if you must know . " " Yeah , but is n't he  --  say , No-Dice sounded off about getting Erb roped into a game . " Johnny cleared his throat , in embarrassment .  | " Well , that 's where I figured on seeing Erb . Just for a few minutes . I 'm not going to get into the game . " " No ? Then let me take care of the roll until tomorrow . " " I 've got enough will power , I think , to resist a crap game . " " Oh yeah ? What about last night ? " " I was nervous then . That 's got nothing to do ? " " The hell it has n't , Johnny . You always get nervous when you hear the dice clicking . Gim me the dough ! " " I 'll give you ten bucks , Sam . And my promise . . . . " Sam Cragg took the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes . " All right , but remember that I warned you . No-Dice is too slick with the dominoes .... " " I know , I know , Sam . You better hurry off to that movie . " Johnny waited until Sam had gone , then he strolled into the lobby of the Carter-Lambert and signaled the bell captain to one side . He took out a dollar . " Look , son , could you pick me up a pair of dice ? Regulation size . You know . . . about this big ... " The bell captain gave him a wink . " Where 's it going to be , Chief ? "  | " I 'm not running the game . It 's just  --  well , a fella won some money from me and I thought he was too darned lucky , if you know what I mean . " " Oh , it 's like that , huh ! In that case , Captain , you better slip me another bill . I 'll get you a pair of loaded bones that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his nose . " No , pal , you 've got the wrong idea . I want honest dice . " " Okay , then how about some soup ? " " Soup ? " " Sure , you know , you rub it on your palm . " Johnny took the bell captain 's arm . " Let 's start at the beginning . You rub this soup on your palm ? what happens then ? " " Why , it 's a colorless liquid . It do n't show , but when you click the ivories in your hand , good and hard , the soup gets heated from the friction and the dice stick together long enough to roll out . Of course you 've got to know how to stack them first . " " I 'll be damned ! " Johnny swore . " What the hell are you doing here , working as a bellboy ? " " Well , you got to make a living somehow , do n't you ? Personally , I do n't shoot craps . I play the nags . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the third at Santa Anita ! " " I 'll remember that . Now here 's another buck .  | For yourself . But just get me a pair of dice , without the soup . " " Okay , if you want to do it the hard way . " The boy scooted away . " Soup ! " muttered Johnny . He sat down in a chair in the lobby . The place was almost as crowded tonight as it had been the night before and there would probably be twice as many people later in the evening . The bell captain returned in about five minutes and slipped Johnny a pair of green dice . " Play them big , mister ! " he said . Johnny took a Boy Scout knife from his pocket and , opening the small blade , scratched his initials on each of the dice . Then he put them in his pocket . He rose to his feet and saw Wallace Erb just entering the hotel . There were two men with him . Johnny intercepted the group in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hello , Mr. Erb . " Erb did not seem to recognize him so Johnny reminded him : " Fletcher , you know , at the fox show this morning . . . . " Erb grimaced . " Oh yes , the man who bought my wife a drink . Yes , of course . That was very kind of you , Mr. Fletcher . " His tone did not indicate any kindness . The elevator door opened and they all entered . Erb looked inquiringly at Johnny , but the latter smiled vacantly.  | " Five , please ! " Wallace Erb said as the car started up . At the fifth floor , Johnny followed the Erb party out of the elevator . As they passed Johnny 's own room , he said : " Say , I 'll bet you 're going to Bobby Coons ' ! " Wallace Erb winked in surprise . " Eh ? " Johnny grinned . " It 's all right . I 've got an invitation , myself . " " Oh , " said Wallace Erb . Then , grudgingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shifty-eyed man of middle age , with pince-nez ? " and Mr. ? er  --  Chester ! " Chester was around thirty-five . He was a waspwaisted , youngish-looking man with slick black hair . He looked like a chorus boy who had outgrown it . Johnny shook hands with both and wondered why Wallace Erb let himself be seen in public with such a pair . By that time , however , the party had halted before the door of Room 505 and Erb had rapped three times . No-Dice opened , smiling a toothy welcome . " Come right in , gents ! The party 's just starting . " He honored Johnny with a sneer . " Thought you was n't coming ? " " I changed my mind , " said Johnny . " It 's a good habit ; just like changing your shirt every week or so . " There were several other men in the room ,  | already , although the only one Johnny knew was Lord Mike Seymour . Johnny looked around the place . No-Dice had spread himself . He actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furnished as a sitting room and from somewhere , No-Dice had contrived a rather professional-looking crap table , approximately eight feet long by four wide , with a six-inch backstop all around . The table and the backstop were lined with regulation billiard-table felt . " Not bad , " Johnny commented , " not bad at all . " " The house dick fixed it up , " Lord Mike explained . " We had to bribe him anyway , so we made him earn the money . " " Very thoughtful . You backing No-Dice 's game , Mike ? " Lord Mike shrugged . " I 'm furnishing the class , if any . " No-Dice was explaining Mike 's status to the new arrivals . " He 's a real lord too , ai n't you , Mike ? " " Well , " said Lord Mike , " it 's an old family , you know . The Seymours . Edward Seymour and Lady Jane , who was Henry the Eighth 's third wife . . . . " He ended in a murmur that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mess jacket came out of the bedroom with a tray of drinks . By the time they were passed around , No-Dice had brought out several  | pairs of dice and a large leather dice cup . He exhibited the cup to Johnny Fletcher . " For you , Fletcher . " " Thanks , No-Dice . And we bump them against the board , too ? " " No bump , no dice , " snapped No-Dice . " All right , let 's get started . I shoot a five spot . " The men lined up quickly around the crap table and the game began . Johnny took some bills from his pocket , but refrained from fading while No-Dice had the dice . Which was a mistake , for No-Dice threw boxcars on his first roll , then doubled his bet , got a four and sevened out on the third roll . Hatch , Erb 's friend with the pince-nez , got the dice next and dropped a half dollar on the cloth . No-Dice said , scornfully : " Let 's not start with chicken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another half dollar . He was quickly faded and promptly threw a seven . He dragged down a dollar , threw an eleven and withdrew another dollar . He got a point then and made it . When he picked up a dollar , No-Dice blew up . " For Christ 's sake , what kind of crap shooting do you call that ? Pinching after every pass ? " " I 'm a conservative man , " Hatch told him coldly . " And I 'll bet you vote the straight Republican ticket , " No-Dice sneered .  | Johnny called across the table . " Shoot a quarter if you feel like it , Mr. Hatch . " No-Dice gave Johnny a dirty look . Hatch made three more passes , dragging down a dollar after each . Then he finally sevened out after a point . Wallace Erb got the dice . He dropped two bills without a word . The bills were fifties . A whistle went up around the table . " Shoot ! " said No-Dice . " I 've got it . " Erb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so they bumped the backstop . The dice rebounded and came to rest , six-six ! Without the least perturbation , Erb counted off four fifties and a hundred . Johnny said : " I 'll take a hundred of that ! " " I was on him first , " snarled No-Dice . " All right , take the other two hundred . We 'll keep the game sociable . " No-Dice started to say something , then covered the balance of the bet . Erb rolled out the dice . He got a six , rolled again and seven came up . He had lost four hundred dollars inside of sixty seconds . Of that , Johnny had won a hundred . The dice came to Johnny . He threw down the hundred he had just won . " Easy come , easy go ! " Erb , as last man , covered the bet quickly . Johnny banged out the dice and they stopped at six-one . " Shoot the two , " he said , as nonchalantly as he could .  | " I 'll take half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Johnny threw an eight , followed with three inconsequential rolls , then made the eight . " Shoot the four ! " he exclaimed . No-Dice muttered under his breath , but covered half the bet . Erb again took the other half . Johnny promptly rolled out an eleven . " Shshoot it all ! " he quavered . " I 'll take it all , " said Erb . No-Dice did not even try to horn in . Johnny shook the dice mightily in the leather cup , rolled them out  --  and gasped . The cubes had stopped again at eleven . There was sixteen hundred dollars on the table and all of it was velvet . Perspiration filmed Johnny 's forehead . With hands that trembled , he started to scoop in the bills . Wallace Erb 's cool voice halted him : " I 'm still willing to fade it ! " Johnny almost choked . " Six  --  sixteen hundred dollars ? " Erb drew a packet of bills from an inside pocket . They were all hundreds . He counted out sixteen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made four passes , the odds against another were overwhelmingly against him . He might never again have this much money in his possession at one time .  | But sight of the bills , the sixteen brand-new hundreds that Erb had dropped to the table , did something to him . After all . . . he could have thirtytwo hundred dollars , just as easily as sixteen . He said : " All right . " He dropped the dice into the cup , rattled them around weakly and rolled them out . His eyes tried to follow the dancing cubes , but blurred . " Goddam it ! " roared No-Dice . Then Johnny knew that he had won thirty-two hundred dollars . He stared at Wallace Erb , but the wealthy fox breeder shook his head . " I 'll take a couple hundred ! " No-Dice snapped . Deliberately , Johnny gathered up the thirty-two hundred dollars . He reached into his pocket , brought out a one-dollar bill and tossed it on the table . " I shoot , " he said , " one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you say anything , No-Dice , I 'll knock your teeth in ! " No-Dice slobbered at the mou , ' i , but Lord Mike stepped up behind him and griped his arm in a powerful hand . " Easy , Bobby ! " he said . One of the other players faded the dollar . Johnny got a nine for a point , rolled a seven immediately afterwards . The dice worked their way around the table to No-Dice . And the little gambler began doing his stuff . He began easily enough , doubled his money  | and redoubled , then dragged down . When he dragged down he threw a crap . He doubled the bet after a crap and invariably threw a natural . He held the dice more than ten minutes and when he finally passed them , after losing a small bet , he was a thousand dollars ahead ; most of the money having been contributed by Wallace Erb . None by Johnny . When the dice came to Wallace Erb he put down five hundred dollars . The money was contributed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed and shot the thousand . He lost and Johnny came out ahead on the play . Then the waiter let a group of newcomers into the room : Jessie and Hal Thompson and Patricia Erb . Jessie wore the same dress and fox cape she 'd worn during the day , but Mrs. Erb had on a daring white evening gown and a white fox cape . She came promptly to the table . " ' Lo , Wally , " she greeted her husband casually , " losing ? " " A little , " Erb admitted . Patricia Erb edged up beside Johnny so her elbow touched his . " You seem to be doing all right , Mr. Fletcher . " " The game 's young yet , " Johnny replied . " I 'll stand here and bring you luck . " She wore a different perfume tonight , a tantalizing odor that reminded Johnny faintly of violets . Hal Thompson and his sister walked around to  | the other side of the table . Johnny caught Jessie Thompson 's eyes and winked . She placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inhaled softly . Fingerprints . She was trying to tell him that Lieutenant Cantrell had somehow obtained her prints . The waiter brought more drinks and the game went on . The man on the other side of Patricia Erb passed the dice and she scooped them up , gleefully . " Give me some money , Wally ! I want to play . " Wallace Erb shook his head . " You know I do n't approve of your gambling , Patricia ! " " Oh , shucks ! " she retorted . " I ca n't lose any more than you usually do . " She turned impulsively to Johnny Fletcher . " Lend me some money , please ! " Without waiting for his reply she plucked a handful of money from his fist . She threw it across the table , in front of No-Dice . " I shoot that ! " Johnny gasped . There were eight one-hundreddollar bills in that foolish handful . " Hey ! " he protested , " that 's a lot of money . " " Oh , I 'll give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I feel lucky today . " " I 'll fade it ! " exclaimed No-Did. , ; . " You 're on ! " cried Patricia Erb and quickly rolled out the dice . A pair of fives was the result . " Ten , " said No-Dice . " I 'll lay you three to two you ca n't make it . "  | Desperately , Johnny tried to save his money , but Patricia beat him to it . " You 're on ! " She whisked several bills from Johnny 's hand and tossed them across the table . " Six hundred , and I 'm laying nine against it , " said No-Dice . " That 's a sucker 's bet , No-Dice , " snapped Johnny , " and you know it . You ought to lay two to one on ten . " " I 'll do that , " said Wallace Erb . " Four thousand to two that she does n't make a ten . " Johnny stared at the wealthy fox breeder . There was a sneer on Erb 's lips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man angered Johnny . Or , perhaps it was Erb 's silly wife , who grabbed other people 's hundred-dollar bills as if they were cigar coupons . " Hold it , Mrs. Erb , " he said , grimly . " I think I 'll take that bet . " He began counting his money and found that it left him with exactly the amount with which he had come into the game . " All right . . . . Johnny ? " Patricia Erb cried . He nodded . " Shoot ! " She sailed the dice across the table to the backstop . They rebounded to the center and stopped at six-four ! Patricia howled in glee . " We win ! I knew we 'd win , Johnny . Take it , all the money . It 's yours ! "  | " No , " he said , " I 'll take just what you borrowed . Your winnings are your own . " He gathered up all the money and sorted out hers ; eight hundred from the original bet and NoDice 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty-four hundred dollars for himself , all of it clear profit . Across the table his eyes met Jessie Thompson 's . " You ought to quit now , Mr. Fletcher , " she said , smiling . No-Dice was muttering frantically . Wallace Erb said , calmly : " They 're still your dice , Patricia ! " " Oh , I do n't want them , " she said , " I 've had enough . Take the money , Wally darling ! " For a moment Wallace Erb 's composure almost cracked . But he made a tremendous effort and controlled himself . " Very well , my dear , " he murmured and took her seventeen hundred dollars . Johnny took the dice and played cautiously , shooting a paltry fifty dollars . He made two passes , drew down , then sevened out on a point . The ivories made their way around to No-Dice . The little gambler brought out a checkbook then . He made a flourish of writing out a check . " Since this game 's gone wild , " he announced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd like to shoot five thousand dollars ! " Johnny Fletcher guffawed . " With a check ? "  | " The check 's good , " glared No-Dice . " It 's on the Wheat Exchange in New York . " " I could write one for a half million on the Fourth National in Omaha , " Johnny said , " but try to get money on it . " Wallace Erb said , succinctly : " I 'll endorse Mr. Coons ' check . " Johnny gasped softly . He looked slowly around the table . No-Dice was desperate , but there would be no five thousand forthcoming from this crowd , unless Wallace Erb covered the bet , and from his intention of endorsing the check , it did n't seem apparent that he would . Erb 's two guests  --  Hatch , the man with the pincenez and the ex-chorus boy , Chester  --  moved back from the table and whispered together for a moment . Then they returned and Hatch , the man who had tried to shoot fifty cents at the beginning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endorse the check , I 'll cover it ! " Johnny 's brain whirled . What a mad game this was . And what a set of characters ! No-Dice shoved his check along to Erb and the latter , after the slightest of hesitations , endorsed it . Then Hatch and his younger friend , Chester , began shelling out . They brought money from several pockets and finally scraped up forty-two hundred  | dollars . Hatch , apologetically , wrote a check for the balance . " It 's all right , is n't it ? " No-Dice nodded impatiently . He scooped up the dice and then Hatch said : " Just a minute , please . Do you mind ? I 'd like to examine the dice ? " No-Dice practically threw the dice cup at Hatch . " Friends of yours , Mr. Erb ? " " Yes , " said Wallace Erb . " Very good friends . " Hatch and Chester examined the dice minutely , balancing the edge of one in the center spot of another , rubbing their fingers over the edges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced his own dice . " I was saving these , but you can have them if you like . " He rolled them across the table . " I scratched my initials in them just in case . " " Fletcher , " said No-Dice , " I would n't have been mad at all if you had n't showed up tonight . " " That 's what I thought , " Johnny retorted . " So , if you do n't like my presence , why ? " " You can stay now , since you 've got most of the money ! " snarled No-Dice . Patricia Erb put in her two cents ' worth . " If they do n't want us here , Johnny , let 's you and me go down to the cocktail lounge and get a drink . " " That , " said Johnny , " is an idea ! " Patricia Erb slipped her hand under Johnny 's arm . " Come ! "  | At that moment , Hatch announced : " We 'd like you to use Mr. Fletcher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . " Viciously , No-Dice took the dice from Hatch . He dropped them into the dice cup , picked it up and shook it furiously . " Just a minute , " Johnny said , to Patricia Erb . " I want to see this . " No-Dice rolled out Johnny 's own dice ; they rolled smoothly to the far end of the table , hit the railing and bounced back a few inches . They came up six-six  --  a crap ! Johnny pulled Patricia Erb through the door as No-Dice began swearing .  | Chapter Eleven In the corridor Johnny 's knees felt suddenly weak , but Patricia Erb tugged insistently on his arm . " I was trying to get you away . They would have won all your money . " " Oh yeah ? They did n't make such a good start . And who are they ? " " That man who got so mad  --  Coons is his name , is n't it ? And . . . my husband ! " " Your husband ? " Johnny echoed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fox show . All the time you and I were having those martinis . And Wally wanted me to stay at home this evening . If it had n't been for Jessie Thompson and her brother , I would n't have dared break in like that . . . . " " But we 've left them back there . Er . . should n't we have asked them to come along ? " " No . I told Jessie I was going to get you away . She agreed to back my play . " Johnny had rung for the elevator and it stopped at the floor now . On the way down , he remained  | silent . In the lobby , Patricia said : " The bar in here is a favorite of the locals . " They had a hard time getting a table and finally had to content themselves with high stools at the bar . Johnny ordered martinis . Then he turned to Patricia : " All right , Patsy , spill it . " " Spill what ? " " About your husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a game for my benefit ? They did n't even know for sure that I 'd be at the game . " " Oh , it was n't for you . It was for those others , Mr. Hatch and Chester . " " Hatch and Chester . Do you know , that when the dice came around the first time , Hatch actually tried to bet a half dollar ? " " But he covered five thousand dollars later . " " Just who , " said Johnny , " are Mr. Hatch and Mr. Chester ? " " I do n't know . They came out to the house this afternoon . Wally spent all afternoon with them . I think Hatch is a lawyer . " " And Chester ? " Johnny looked thoughtfully at Patricia Erb for a moment . Then he said , quietly : " That name Chester . . . your husband hesitated over it when he introduced him . " Patricia Erb 's mascaraed eyes widened . " Chester ... you do n't , surely you do n't think ? ... " ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thirtyfive . Tell me , how did your husband take to them ? when they first showed up , I mean ? " " I did n't see him then . After they 'd had their talk and tonight  --  well , you saw how calm he was . That means he 's in a dangerous mood . He 's always calm when he 's unusually angry . Not like me . I blow up . But  --  Johnny . I do n't believe he could be Chester Erb . Not after all these years ? " " Shhh ! " said Johnny . Out of the tail of his eye he had caught sight of a black fox cape approaching . He turned and smiled at Jessie Thompson and her brother . " Oh , hello there ! Join us in a drink , wo n't you ? " " You can afford two , after the money you won , " retorted Jessie . Johnny grinned . " Excuse me for running out like that , but that was one game I wanted to quit winners . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No-Dice make out with the check business ? " " They 're still fighting over that , " Hal Thompson said . " The man you call No-Dice claims the dice you threw in were loaded . And the others , Hatch and Chester , insist they 're absolutely square . " " They 're honest , all right , " said Johnny . " Which is more than I 'd say about No-Dice and his regular dice . "  | " If I were you , " Hal Thompson said , " I 'd keep out of that fellow 's path for a while . He 's plenty burned up at you . " " I can handle the little squirt , " Johnny said , confidently . " If I ca n't , I know someone . . . who can . . . " His voice trailed off , for he discovered that Hal Thompson was n't even listening to him . Thompson was having a little duel with Patricia Erb , a duel of expressions . Jessie Thompson was aware of it , too , and seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by suddenly stepping between her brother and Patricia and calling loudly to the bartender . " A daiquiri ! " " What 'll you have , Thompson ? " Johnny asked , smoothly . " Me ? " Hal Thompson 's handsome face was flushed , " Why . . . nothing , I guess . " " Make that a daiquiri and a whisky sour , " Jessie told the bartender . " One drink wo n't hurt you , Hal . Then we 'll call it a day . " " And I , " said Patricia Erb , " will go home and put all the little silver foxes to bed . Eh . . . Wally ? " Wallace Erb was threading his way through the tables to the bar , as unperturbed as when his wife had thrown the dice that had cost him four thousand dollars .  | He smiled pleasantly . " Thought I 'd find you all here . " " Where are your friends , Mr. Erb ? " Johnny asked . " They lose the argument ? " " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " is the attendant bickering . Some men simply can not lose a dollar without complaining about it . " " You lost quite a few dollars , " Hal Thompson said . His tone had a note of truculency , but Erb did not seem to notice . He shrugged . " I can afford it . " He looked at Johnny . " I 'm glad you won . " " Why , thanks , Mr. Erb . That 's very nice of you . " " Not at all . I did n't care a lot for that little fellow  --  Coons . I would n't believe his assertion that your dice were loaded . " " I 'd like to go home , Wally , " Patricia Erb said , suddenly . " Of course , my dear , " her husband agreed . " It 's been a pleasure , you know . . . . " He bowed all around and helped to adjust his wife 's wrap . " There , " said Johnny as the Erbs moved away , " is one real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a squawk out of him . " Hal Thompson 's lips were moving , but no sound came from them . Jessie Thompson toyed with her daiquiri , her eyes on the mahogany bar . There was  | an odd tenseness in the little group and Johnny wondered about it . Hal Thompson definitely was hostile to him ; but why , Johnny could not determine . Unless . . . it had something to do with Patricia Erb . His eyes wandered about the room and caught sight of the bell captain at the entrance to the lobby . The latter nodded and throwing back his shoulders began a page : " Calling Mr. Whiffletree . Calling Mr. Whiffletree . " He came through the bar , stopped at Johnny 's shoulder and searching the room said out of the side of his mouth : " Make out all right with the tops , Chief ? " Johnny nodded casually , then suddenly reached out and caught the boy 's arm . " Tops ? What do you mean ? " Still searching the room , the bell captain winked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thought you 'd need them . I had a whiff of that game you were heading for and it was loaded for moose . " Lips tight , Johnny turned to Hal Thompson and his sister . " Excuse me a minute , folks . I just want to get a matter straight . " Clutching the bell captain 's arm he led him to the side of the room . " Now , chum , " he said , " Put that hog Latin into straight English . "  | " Sure , Chief . Nothin ' to it . I got wind that a certain party is a big-time gambler and that he was rigging up a little setup for the benefit of a couple of suckers . When you beefed about being taken before by this certain party , I figured maybe you were the sucker . So when you asked for a pair of ivories I got you some tops . . . . You know , they 're loaded so they throw only the high points . Of course you have to take your chances with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your favor . Say .. . this certain party did n't nick you again , did he ? " Johnny heaved a tremendous sigh . " No , this certain party did n't nick me . But your tops did do something . And if there 's a murder or something around here tonight , you can be one of the pallbearers . You 'll have earned the right . " " I do n't get you ? Did the certain party get hep ? " Johnny shook his head . " I never used your . . . tops . But just the same , here 's something for your concern about me . " He slipped the boy a twenty-dollar bill and wondered why the fellow was wasting his time out here in the Middle West when Broadway and 48th Street was simply yearning for him . He returned to the Thompsons . " Well , " he said , " I 've just learned that those dice I threw into the  | game were tops . The little lad there got them for me . Thought he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reputation . " He grinned at the puzzlement on Jessie Thompson 's face . " In other words , " he explained . " Those dice  --  my dice were loaded , so they would throw only high points . And No-Dice threw a high point , a ? a twelve ! " Jessie Thompson exclaimed . " But that was .. . cheating ! " " Sure , " Johnny admitted . " But 1 did n't benefit from it . I won my money with No-Dice 's dice . And speaking of cheating , you should have seen No-Dice call his shots last night . A ten with a six-four , a seven with a six-ace . I think he could have made a thirteen if he 'd wanted . Sorry , Miss Thompson , I ca n't cry over No-Dice 's loss . " Hal Thompson snickered . " And Erb was backing him on that play . He 'll have to make good that check . I think I 'll have another drink . . . . Another whisky sour , please . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Johnny said . " You do n't care an awful lot for Wallace Erb , do you , Thompson ? " " What do you think ? " Thompson asked , sourly . " I think we 'd better call it a day , " Jessie Thompson said , hurriedly . " Come along , Hal . " Hal Thompson finally seemed willing to talk ,  | but his sister tugged insistently on his sleeve . Somewhat regretfully , Johnny watched them leave . He would have given a good deal to learn why Patricia Erb and Hal Thompson had fought a duel with their eyes ; why Hal Thompson hated Wallace Erb . . . and why Hal Thompson had remained over in Chicago , while his sister came on to the fox show . Johnny remembered something else , too ; Jessie Thompson 's studied nonrecognition of Alfred Orpington the night before at the Main Street Cocktail Lounge . He wished he had the answer to all those puzzles . Including the puzzle of the frame-up between Wallace Erb , a millionaire , and No-Dice Bobby Coons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawyer named Hatch and a man named Chester . But those answers were not forthcoming tonight . In the meantime it was eleven o'clock and Sam Cragg ought to be returning from his movie  --  and Bingo . Johnny left the hotel bar and was riding up in the elevator before he suddenly recalled that Room 515 to which he was now going was a room in which a man had been murdered only the night before . They 'd cleaned up the bathroom of course , but it did not take too much imagination to recall blood that had been there less than twenty-four hours previously .  | He put his key into the lock and discovered that the door was unlocked . Sam Cragg had returned . He pushed open the door , but Sam was not in the room . No-Dice was there , however . And so was Lord Mike Seymour . The latter was sitting placidly in the creaking rocking chair , while NoDice , restless as ever , was pacing the floor . There was a cut on No-Dice 's chin . The little gambler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wise guy ! " he snarled . Johnny ignored No-Dice altogether . He said to Lord Mike : " Mike , you broke into my room ? " The big Englishman did not seem very happy about it . " Sorry , old chappie ! " he said . " Hate like the devil to do this and all that , but I 'm a business partner of Bobby 's . And you did pull a fast one tonight . Sort of , you know . " " The moral of that , Mike , " Johnny said , coolly , " is do n't play with wolves without gloves on your hands . You might get bit . " " The hell with that crap , Fletcher ! " No-Dice snapped . " Those dice you threw into my game were phonies  --  tops ! I lost five grand with them and I want it back . " " You lost the money , No-Dice ? " " It was my check ! " " But Wallace Erb endorsed it . He 'll pay . "  | Lord Mike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't in the deal . " " Deal , eh ? Now , we 're getting somewhere , boys . You two cooked up a deal with Erb to rook Hatch and Chester . The deal misfired because I got into the game and had a lucky streak . Just what was the setup , Mike ? " Lord Mike shrugged . " I want that dough , Fletcher ! " No-Dice insisted . " Maybe you 'll get it . If you tell me what the game was . Erb was supposed to furnish the plush , lose a lot of folding money and get the suckers to thinking they might get some of the big number stuff . Then you were going to dust them off . That was it , eh ? " " I do n't know what the hell you 're talking about , " said No-Dice . " All I know is that you rung in a pair of loaded dice on me and I lost five grand with them . And you 're going to kick through with it . " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't see it that way at all . You fellows set out to trim a couple of suckers and you got trimmed instead . I 'm willing to let it go at that . " " Ca n't , old chappie , " Lord Mike said . " We really need the money . " " So do I. And now , if you do n't mind ? " Lord Mike got up from the rocking chair . He was a pretty big fellow . " I really hate to have it  | end like this , Johnny . But ? " His long , muscular arm looped out toward Johnny . It swished past Johnny 's ear , for Johnny ducked and stepped to one side . " Somebody 's going to get hurt , Mike ! " he cautioned . No-Dice was slipping brass over his knuckles . " I 'll take him , Mike ! " he cried . Johnny was between the two . He was n't so much afraid of Lord Mike . The Englishman was big and probably packed a stiff wallop . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knockout . On the other hand , No-Dice was a mad dog and the brass knuckles on his fist would break bones , or tear flesh badly . It was the psychological moment for Sam Cragg to return . He opened the door without knocking , closed it quickly behind him . He took in the situation in a single glance . " Brass knuckles , hey ? " he said and moved toward No-Dice . Johnny relaxed , instantly . He knew his friend . No-Dice looked worried . " Lay off , Cragg ! " he growled . " Lay off , or I 'll let you have it . " Sam smiled pleasantly . " Sure , punk ! " He feinted with his left and when No-Dice 's brass fist sizzled forward , he chopped it down with his right .  | Then he stepped in and picked up the little gambler . Without any appreciable effort he tossed him bodily into the far corner of the room . He turned casually and asked : " Is Mike backing his play ? " " Some other time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With his hand on the knob , he stopped . " Come on , Bobby . " No-Dice crawled to the door on his hands and knees . The Englishman helped him to his feet and outside . ti Johnny shot the bolt . " Nice timing , Sam . I was afraid for a minute there , that your fondness for Bingo was going to get me into trouble . " " I missed Bingo by one number , " Sam said , disgustedly . " What 's been happening ? " " A large evening , Sammy . First of all , I did n't lose all our money . " " I 'm glad to hear that , " Sam growled . " What 've you got left , a dollar and a half ? " Johnny took the money from his pocket . " I won over five thousand dollars . No-Dice got outslicked . He rigged the game to take Erb and got took himself  --  only a couple of strangers and I did the taking . That 's what the rumpus was about ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ai n't that much hay . It must be counterfeit . "  | " Then Mr. Wallace Erb must be making it . He contributed this . " " Yeah ? Then what 'd No-Dice squawk about ? " Johnny related the crap game episode . " I 'll probably stay awake all night worrying why Erb was willing to endorse No-Dice 's check , then backed out on it . " He was wrong , however . No sooner had his head touched the pillow than he fell asleep .  | Chapter Twelve The ghosts did not bother Johnny Fletcher . He slept that night like a convict on his first night after being released from a ten-year stretch . And when he bounced out of bed and felt the money in his trousers pocket he felt as cheerful as a sailor on shore leave in San Francisco with seven hundred dollars . " Sammy ! " he roared . " Get up so we can go out and take this town apart ! " Sam Cragg sat up and rubbed the sleep from his eyes . " Ow-wuh ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I dreamt that I had a ten-dollar ticket on a plug that paid off $96.8o and I accidentally tore up the ticket and the pari-mutuel guy would n't give me the dough . " " So you beat him up , eh ? " " Naw ; I kept swingin ' at him and he kept duckin ' to beat the band and I never got to lay a hand on him . " Johnny shook his head in mock sympathy . " A dream like that is n't good for you , Sammy . Shows you 're subconsciously frustrated . Come on , let 's  | have breakfast , then I 'll look up some big guy for you to lick . " Sam grinned . " The squirt , No-Dice , did n't even give me any exercise . I wish Lord Mike had butt in . He 's a pretty big guy . " " I 'm going to have a little talk with him today . I do n't like his throwing in with No-Dice . " Sam Cragg got out of bed and pulled his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going ahead with the cops-and-robber stuff ! I know I 'm wasting my breath arguing with you . But when it 's all over and we 're up Salt Creek , do n't forget ? " " That you told me so ! " They had breakfast in the coffee shop of the Carter-Lambert . Sam Cragg punished a large order of ham and eggs and for desert had a stack of wheat cakes . Across the street from the garage , Johnny stopped . " I do n't feel like being bothered about tires this morning , Sam . You get the bus . Pay him the storage and tell him to keep the tires on ice . Tonight we 'll take the car to a different garage . " Sam grumbled , but went across to the garage and brought out the car . When he stopped at the curb to pick up Johnny the garage man had followed to the sidewalk and looked over . " I gave him a tip on a horse , " Sam shrugged . " You 're learning , Sam . Stop up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the big building with the sign : Cedar City Tribune . ' " " You could have got a newspaper in the hotel , " Sam remarked . " I know , but I wanted the exercise . " When Sam parked in front of the newspaper building , Johnny climbed out and said : " I may be a little while , Sam . Finish your nap . " He walked into the newspaper office . There was a redhead at the switchboard and Johnny gave her the old personality . " I 'm Johnny Fletcher , the famous New York detective , " he told the girl . " I 'm after a ring of international jewel thieves and I 've reason to believe that the leader of the gang is a former resident of Cedar City . I want to look at your old files . Think you can arrange it for me ? " The redhead stared at Johnny in astonishment . " What ? . . . " she began , weakly . Johnny cocked his head to one side and looked the girl over appraisingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How come my pal Manny Meadows , the talent scout , overlooked you when he passed through here last month ? " The girl took the headpiece from her ears and shook her head . " Right down that hall until you come to a place that looks like the furnace room . That 's the morgue . Go quick  --  before I faint ! "  | Johnny winked at the redhead and she called after him : " Stop here on your way back ! " Some one with an ancient sense of humor had painted a red coffin with a lily over it , on the door of the morgue . Inside the room was a gray-haired old man behind a desk stacked high with newspapers . He was clipping items with a large pair of shears . " Hi , Pop ! " Johnny sang out . " They gave me an okay up front to look over some of your old files . " The old man pointed to the shelves of bound volumes , which ran all the way up to the ceiling . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ladder . Help yourself . " Johnny got the stepladder . With one foot on it , he asked : " Been on this job long , Pop ? " " No , " was the reply . " Only fourteen years . Before that I was on the copy desk for seventeen years . In another ten , the paper 's going to put me out on grass . " Johnny said , admiringly : " Bet you 've seen a lot in your time . Maybe you remember the case I 'm interested in . It happened about twenty years ago ? in Chicago . A boy named Chester Erb walked off and was seen no more . " " The Erb case ? " The old man brightened and got up from his chair . He came around to Johnny . " That 's always been one of my favorite cases . I 've got a theory about it . "  | " Have you ? " exclaimed Johnny . " Why , so have I. I figure he was kidnaped by a band of gypsies ... " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " This happened in Chicago . There ai n't no gypsies there . You got to remember that the kid 's old man was lousy with money and that the kid was his heir . " " Except for his brother , who was n't so lousy with money . " The old man bobbed his head up and down , in excitement . " That 's it , that 's my theory . The kid was n't kidnaped . He was killed by this uncle of his . " Johnny rubbed his hands together . " Now , you 're talking , Pop ! ? By the way , what 's your name ? " " Pop . Pop Peebles . They all call me that . And look , boy , I 'm going to tell you something else . That kid 's uncle , Wallace Erb , his name was , he 's living right here in Cedar City , today . And you know what ? He inherited the entire Chester Erb estate and today he 's considered just about the richest man we got in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cried . " That is something ! You know I 'm doing a feature story for True Crime Stories . I 'm going into all the old mysteries and speculating on the real story behind the mysteries . . . . " Pop Peebles shook his head . " You better lay off  | the Erb case , then . Wallace Erb 'd sue you to hell and gone , you even hinted he had anything to do with the kid 's disappearance . They say he 's touchy about that subject . Even if it is twenty years old . " " Well , if he 's still alive I would n't dare say anything about him , but just the same I 'd like to refresh my memory on the case . I might give it to our readers as a mystery , and let them make their own deductions . . . . " " That might be a good idea . Maybe the magazine 'd give prizes for logical explanations . I figure I 'd like to try something like that myself . . . . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 28 . You 'll find most of the dope in it . " Johnny got down Volume 28 and brought it to Pop Peebles ' desk . The old man riffled through the pages and stopped before a layout of pictures . " Here it is , the mugs of all the principles . The kid ? Chester Erb  --  his father , mother and the uncle Wallace . " Johnny studied the old newspaper cuts . The picture of Chester Erb was a full-length one , showing the boy in knickers , posed before what had probably been an imposing house in those days . Chester Erb seemed to have been a somewhat slight , dark-haired boy , a little on the sullen side . His father had been about forty and by comparison with Wallace Erb 's  | picture , had apparently been about five years the older of the two . Chester Erb 's mother had been in her early thirties , a handsome woman , perhaps thin for 1919 . A large headline ran across the entire page , over the photos . It asked : WHERE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ text below the photos . Pop Peebles meanwhile kept on a running commentary : " I remember the story as if it happened on'y last week . Chester started home from his school one afternoon and on the corner near his home said good-bye to a couple of his friends ? " " Whose names , ' " said Johnny , reading , " were Jimmie Hayes and Archie Fitzgerald . The three boys were classmates at the Larchwood Junior High . Both Jimmie and Archie made statements to the police declaring that Chester Erb had always seemed completely happy and contented , as a boy whose father was worth a million dollars should be . Archie Fitzgerald , however , later made an additional statement . He said that Chester had confided in him only a week before his disappearance that he was mad at his father because he wanted to join the Boy Scouts and the old man would n't let him ? ' " " Stop right there , my boy ! " cut in Pop Peebles . " You 're talking to an old newspaper man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tripe like that ten thousand times . The police get hold of a  | witness who 's seen a common everyday little thing and reports it just as he saw it . The story do n't fit in with the police theory , or maybe the police have n't even got a theory or a suspect and are getting razzed by some busybody skirt committee . . . or maybe even a newspaper , if they 're editorially opposed to the current administration . So what do the cops do ? They get to work on a witness , ask him a thousand questions , get him all balled up and confused until the dope does n't even remember his own name . Then he makes an additional statement , ' one that the police use to bolster up their own theory  --  or lack of theory . With a kid , it was like eating ice cream . Those Chicago bulls made a mess of the business and needed an alibi . " " Umm , " said Johnny , " maybe you 're right . But look at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bother to change that any . This Jimmie Hayes and Archie Fitzgerald both said they left Chester on the corner near his home and they saw him walking toward it . He never got home . So whatever happened to him happened to him between that corner where his schoolmates left him and Chester 's house a half block up the street . What do you make of that ? " " Nothing . They  --  the family , I mean  --  were n't expecting Chester to disappear . They were n't standing by the windows watching for him to come home .  | Or maybe one of them was . Wallace Erb . Maybe he was even sitting in a car in front of the house , enticed the kid into it and drove off . " " Or , " said ' Johnny , " maybe there was n't a car there and young Chester just walked past the house and kept on walking . " " Away from a million bucks ? " " What 's a million dollars to ' a kid fourteen years old ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before he got tired ? And how long would he go before he got hungry ? Remember , too , that this was after school and it was winter . It would 've been dark in another hour . Where would the kid sleep ? See , boy ? You 're new with this case . Me , I 've been thinking it over for twenty years and I can see it only one way  --  somebody snatched the kid and did away with him . Who else would it be but his uncle , Wallace Erb , who stood to inherit all of his brother 's dough , if there was n't any heir ? " " Except that Chester Erb , Senior , was n't much older than his brother and Wallace could n't have any assurance that he 'd outlive Chester , Senior . " " But he did , " Pop Peebles said , significantly . " And Chester Erb , Senior , lived only five years . His wife  --  the kid 's mother died inside of six months . " " Meaning , " Johnny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? "  | " I would n't want to be quoted on that . " Johnny sighed . " Well , it 's a theory . " " A damn good one ! I 've got the advantage over you , young fellow , because I know Wallace Erb . I see him often enough . He owns half this newspaper . " Johnny blinked , then chuckled . " So you would n't exactly be getting your theory published in this paper . " " I would n't be put out in that clover field . " " No . Well , look , Pop ; if I was to tear out this page ? " The old man was aghast . " From my bound file copy ? Gawd ! " " I thought not . There would n't be any old copies of this issue around , would there ? . . . " " None that old . But why do n't you let me make a photostatic copy for you . " " Why , sure ! Why n't I think of that ? How much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a half profit on the deal . I 'll have it for you day after tomorrow . " " That 'll be swell . Here 's the dollar . Thanks a lot , Pop . I 'll call for the photostatic copy . " Johnny shook hands with the old man and departed . At the switchboard the redhead hurriedly took off her headpiece . " So you 're from New York , mister ? "  | " By way of Hollywood . I 'm a talent scout for Hollywood Studios . If you 'll send your picture to me when I get back , I 'll see if I ca n't wangle a screen test for you . " " Oh , so it 's like that now . " " Uh-huh . But look , I 've got to rush over to Chicago . I 'll be back in two days . Keep Thursday night open and we 'll talk it over . " There was an inkpad on top of the switchboard . Beside it lay a rubber stamp . Johnny toying with it , noted that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Rush . Chuckling , he took several cards from his vest . He shuffled them and selected one , reading : " Achilles Alexandrapoulous , Fine Wines and Liquors . " He pressed the rubber stamp on the inkpad , then took another card and laid it partly over the card of Achilles . Then he pressed the rubber stamp over it . When he removed the second card , the word Press , in red ink , was imprinted in the center of card number one . " So now I 'm a newspaperman , " he said to himself . He waved cheerily to the redhead who had watched the proceedings with a frown and walked out of the newspaper office . Sam Cragg was dozing over the wheel . " Uh , it  | took you long enough , " he groused when Johnny climbed in beside him . Johnny nodded . " Now , to business . The fairgrounds , my good man . " Sam Cragg started the motor . He had driven more than a block before he said : " Your friend , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He gave me a dirty look . " " That was n't a dirty look , " Johnny said , " that was his natural expression . " When they approached the entrance to the fairgrounds , Johnny said : " Today , do n't quite stop . Keep her rolling in second . Not too fast , but just fast enough to make it a little tough . " Sam blew up . " What the hell , Johnny . You got enough money to pay ? " " I know , but I 've got to keep in training . I want to try a new one , today ? Shift ! . . . " Sam threw the gearshift lever into second and rolled up to the window taker . Johnny drew his brand-new press card from his pocket and cupped it in his palm . He exposed it casually to the ticket taker and smiled pleasantly . " Nice day , today ! " Out of the other side of his mouth , he said to Sam : " Step on it ! " Sam Cragg shifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnny saw the ticket taker staring after them in bewilderment .  | " Well , that worked , " he said to Sam , " but I 'll have to have a new one tomorrow or try a different gate . " Sam Cragg swore feelingly . They parked again in the space reserved for the officials ' cars . When they got out , Sam asked : " Do we work today ? " " Why , certainly . After a time , when the crowds get big enough . We 'll take a look at the foxies first . " Sam groaned . Lord Mike was outside of his stand , talking earnestly to a woman , whose small son kept pulling at her skirt and asking her to look at the " wooster . " Sam glowered at Mike . Ben Longstreet was in the fox aisle , looking more sour-faced than ever . " You ! . . . " he said bitterly to Johnny . " You fixed me on that vixen . He put her down to sixth place . " " Sixth ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dope he is . How 'd you make out on your other foxes ? " " The best I got was a third on my young pup . I 've got a good notion to complain to the Silver Fox Breeders ' Association . " " About the pup ? " " About Orrin , the blind fool . He 's a scoundrel . Just because he publishes a cheap little fox magazine  | he gives all the blue ribbons to his advertisers . Like Erb and that young Thompson fellow . " " Oh , " said Johnny . " So it 's like that . You do n't happen to have a copy of Orrin 's paper around , do you ? " Longstreet got one from an empty shipping crate . " Here it is , The Silver Fox Digest . It 's no damn good . I put a one inch ad in there once and did n't get but two letters and those were from other magazines soliciting my ad . " Johnny looked at the masthead on the inside cover . The name of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an editorial , with a half column cut of Judge Orrin and the modest little heading : " Judge Orrin Says . " " Nice , " he said . " You like it ? " asked Judge Orrin . Johnny blinked . Ben Longstreet had moved away and from somewhere the sawed-off fox judge had made his appearance at Johnny 's elbow . " Yes , " he replied . " It looks like a mighty fine little magazine . " " Let me send it to you every month . It 's only a dollar a year . . . . " " Why , that 's fine ! But look  --  I 've got a few foxes at home and I 'd like to sell some of my surplus . I do n't want to carry them all through the winter ? " " Yes , sir ! " boomed Judge Orrin , whipping out  | a pad of order blanks . " What you need is a nice display ad . How many foxes did you say you had ? . . . " " Why , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in Canada we raise them on a rather large scale ? " " Do n't I know it ! Finest foxes on the North American continent . Thick , glossy fur  --  a half page would be just about right for you , I 'm thinking . Maybe a full page , eh ? " " Well , I always like a nice large ad . What 're your rates on a full page  --  on a six-time basis ! " Judge Orrin almost drooled . " Six months ! " Well , in that case you 're entitled to the six-time rate . Only $90.00 an issue , minus two per cent for cash in ten days . Just sign your name here .... " Johnny pushed the pencil aside . " I 'm not very good on making up an ad . You write one for me , huh ? Make it good and strong . Say I 've got some of the finest silver foxes in Canada and that my prices this year are the lowest in all my years of breeding . Dress that up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks good I 'll give you a contract . " " Yes sir ! " Judge Orrin hurried off . Johnny could see him at the end of the aisle , leaning over a couple of stacked-up shipping crates , scribbling furiously on a sheet of paper . Then his eyes brightened . Jessie Thompson and  | her silver cape were approaching . She was alone , too , which was the way Johnny wanted it . He moved toward her . " ' Morning , Jessie , " he said , confidently . Her eyebrows arched . " Jessie ? " He grinned . " Call me Johnny . After all , we were practically thrown in jail together , were n't we ? " " Not together , I hope . But . . . " her face clouded . " About those fingerprints . " " I got your signal . Lieutenant Cantrell has your prints ? " She nodded . " He was in the restaurant last night . No sooner had the waiter taken away a dish I 'd touched , than the lieutenant was heading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " murmured Johnny . " Has he braced you yet ? " " Net yet . But I 've an uneasy feeling that I 'll hear from him today . What do you think I should tell him ? " " The truth . " Her sharp white teeth bit into her lower lip . " But . . . he would think then that I knew Orpington .... " " Well ? " She flashed him a quick glance and started to shake her head . But she gave it up . " Of course .  | Well , I had met him , before . But that was a year ago and I did n't remember him . . . . " " No ? " " You do n't believe me ? " " No . You see  --  I was watching you when you looked up at Orpington that time . You knew him all right  --  and he knew you . " Her clear skin darkened a little . " I 'm afraid . . you 're jumping to conclusions . " " Look , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And I 'm as agile as a Mexican jumping bean on a hot stove . Why do n't you break down and tell me what this is all about ? " " What all what is about ? " Johnny sighed . He took Jessie 's arm and led her to one side , away from Sam Cragg , who was mournfully watching a silver fox pup . Johnny led Jessie to the end of the aisle . " You knew Orpington and you did n't like him . He returned the compliment with interest .... " " He was a nasty , evil-minded man . And a cheat ! Of course I recognized him . And I knew right away what he had in that bag . That 's why I wanted to get a good look at it . Not the bag , but the tag on it . " " It contained his name and address . " " I know , but I could n't tell that at a distance . You see , I was sitting in that booth when he came in . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town  | and had n't yet been able to find a hotel room . I thought perhaps he had just gotten the fox from the express office and that he had n't yet thought to remove the shipping tag . But he had . At any rate , that 's why I came up  --  to get a good look at the tag . Johnny pressed his lips tightly together and thought it over . After a while he shook his head . " Fair , but not quite good enough . He was halfcrocked at the time and if he knew what you were doing , as he no doubt did , he 'd have made some remark about it . No . . . there 's more to it than that . " Jessie Thompson exclaimed , " But there is n't . I assure you ? " " No , not yet ! " Johnny said quickly . " I want to leave you room enough to back out . Forget Orpington for a minute . . . . Why does your brother hate Wallace Erb ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she quickly lowered her lids so her gray eyes were mere slits . " He does n't hate him . Dislikes him , yes . But no more so than one competitor dislikes another . . . . " " That may be so , " Johnny said , " although personally I thought it had something to do with Patricia Erb , whom your brother does not dislike ! " He could see the pulse pound in her creamy throat  | and knew that he had scored heavily . He gave her another salvo . " But Patricia Erb no longer likes your brother ? in the manner he wishes . " " I 've got to go , " Jessie Thompson said . He barred her passage by stepping squarely in front of her . " Why do n't you get it off your mind ? I 'm not going to carry it to Wallace Erb , you know . " " It 's ridiculous . My brother scarcely knows Patricia Erb . " " No ? Well , I 'm sorry , then . For butting into things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she walked past him . But only for three paces . Then she whirled and came back . " All right , " she said , tensely . " Hal made a fool of himself over Patricia Erb . It began two months ago when the Erbs came to our own state show . Hal 's been head over heels in love with Patricia ever since . And she  --  she encouraged him . For a while , anyway . " " Hal told you ? " " No . He 's tried to keep it from me . But I know . A week after our show he went to Chicago on business and stayed three days . He wrote letters ? " " To a married woman with a jealous husband ? That was n't very discreet . "  | " I know it was n't . Neither was our coming here . I did n't want to come , but he insisted . And then ? then he stayed over in Chicago . " " I was thinking of that . I wonder . . . if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening . " " She was n't . That 's what surprised me . " " You asked her . " Jessie nodded . " In a roundabout sort of way . I 've  --  well , I 've been playing up to Patricia , just so her  --  her ... " " So her husband would n't catch on that your brother was interested in his wife , eh ? You thought you 'd cover up by giving Patsy a rush yourself .... " " Something like that . But Hal ? " " Hal could n't quite conceal his dislike for his sweetheart 's husband and you think Erb has noticed . " Jessie 's eyes clouded over . Johnny nodded , casually . Then he said : " And Orpington ? " " He was a devil ! He became aware of Hal 's attachment to Patricia at our fair  --  he was there , too ? and I think . . . I think . . . he made Hal pay him some money . " Blackmail ! " " There was a letter from him only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Hal snatched it away from me . He would n't tell me what Orpington was writ-  | ing him about , but I know from his actions the next day or two , that he was greatly upset and  --  there 's Hal , now . He must n't  --  I mean , do n't let on that I 've told you anything . " Hal Thompson had stopped to talk to Longstreet at the far end of the aisle , but he was looking toward Jessie , his sister , and Johnny . " I 'll keep my mouth shut , " Johnny said to Jessie . " And I still think it 'd be wise to tell Cantrell if he questions you about the prints . I mean , about wanting to check up on the tag to see if Orpington had imported a fox . Tell him that much , at least . " " All right . And  --  Johnny  --  I 'm glad I told you . My mind 's freer , now . " " I thought it would be . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He signaled to Sam Cragg and slipped out by the center aisle , toward the poultry end of the building . Lord Mike was gone from in front of the booth , but , as they passed , Johnny saw that the big Englishman was inside , in a huddle with No-Dice . Sam made a moist , raucous sound with his mouth . " Maybe they 're plannin ' to gang up on me , " he said to Johnny . " Maybe . But more likely they 're figuring out how to find a new sucker for No-Dice. "  | Chapter Thirteen But Johnny discovered that the conniving of NoDice and Lord Mike had a more personal touch than the locating of a new sucker . As he stepped out of the poultry building , Lieutenant Cantrell , accompanied by his big stooge , Detective Otto Holtznagle , stopped him . " Just the man I want to see , Fletcher , " Cantrell said , crisply . " They 'll be having you fellows out with lanterns pretty soon , " Johnny said ; " do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a case . Look , Fletcher , are you still sticking to your story that you did n't see Alfred Orpington , after you left him outside the hotel , until I dragged you into your room ? " Johnny scowled . " You think you 've got proof I did ? " Cantrell nodded . " Yes . You want to stick to your story ? " " Who says different ? " " A man named Michael Seymour . He says when he opened your door you were just coming out of  | your own room and you looked like you 'd just seen a ghost . " " Mike 's a liar , " Johnny said pleasantly . " And a bellboy named Tom Chadwick says he stepped out of the elevator as you were leaving your room . " " He 's a liar , too . Who else ? " " Are n't those two enough ? " " No , you browbeat the bellboy until he told you what you wanted to hear . And Lord Mike 's a crook . He 's sore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of money . Some very fine people saw me do it , too . Among them Mr. and Mrs. Wallace Erb . " " I heard about that game last night , " Cantrell growled . " You did n't try to break it up , though ? Too bad . You 'd have games . Miss Jessie Thompson inside ? " Johnny looked sharply at the lieutenant 's broad face . He shrugged . " I do n't know . " " Well , I 'll see . " Cantrell started toward the door of the poultry building , then turned . " By the way , her fingerprints were on Orpington 's bag . Thought you 'd like to know . " With that parting shot Cantrell stepped into the poultry building . Sam Cragg growled to Johnny . " That ape 's going to give the Thompson girl a third degree . "  | " She ready for it ? Oh-oh ! " Martin Hatch and his partner named Chester , stepped out of a doorway , where they had evidently been waiting for Johnny and Sam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great big smile . " Good morning , Mr. Fletcher . How are you , today ? " " Fine . And you ? " " Excellent . Thanks partly to that pair of dice you loaned us last night . We 've just cashed Wally Erb 's check . " " He did n't try to get payment stopped ? " Hatch shook his head . " He could n't afford to . Not in this town . You see , we would n't take Coons ' check . So Erb gave us his own . " Johnny screwed up his mouth . " Just the same I imagine you 'd feel a lot healthier in some other city . You see , those dice  --  I learned afterwards that they were loaded . I bought them innocently enough . I 'm afraid Wallace Erb knows it by this time . " Chester 's face remained as disinterested as ever , but Martin Hatch 's mouth fell open . He shook his head like a bewildered grizzly bear . " You used them yourself ? " " No , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loaded when I bought them . I wanted a pair of my own dice in case No-Dice Coons got too lucky ? a habit he generally has in a crap game . "  | Hatch turned sidewards and looked inquiringly at Chester . The latter nodded . Hatch as spokesman , then turned back to Johnny : " Say , Fletcher , I 've a little proposition to make to you . Is there anywhere around here where we can have a quiet talk ? " " There 's a cafe over there in the Educational Building . Sam  --  you hang around here . When .. . uh . . . " he moved toward Sam and lowered his voice , " when Mrs. Erb shows up come over to the cafe and tell me . " Sam licked his lips wistfully . But he went into the poultry building . Johnny then accompanied Hatch and his taciturn friend  --  or client , for he appeared to be that  --  to the cafe . They ordered drinks , Johnny contenting himself with a glass of beer because it was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sour , and cleared his throat . " I 'll come to the point , Mr. Fletcher . I want to say first that our proposition is being made to you , because you seem to be on our side of the fence , at least you 're an enemy of Wallace Erb . " " How do you make that out ? " " I 'm not blind , Fletcher , " Hatch said , easily . " I was watching last night . Erb 's wife is a bit soft on you , and you  --  well , a disinterested man does n't ordi-  | narily loan another man 's wife seventeen hundred dollars to gamble with . " " But she is Erb 's wife ! " Hatch grunted . " She 's a chorus girl who got tired of living in hall bedrooms , who had a taste for jewels and furs . She married a man twice her age and she 's discovered that you ca n't have fun with diamonds and pearls if nobody ever gets a chance to see them . Besides . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is , now . No chorus girl stays married to a poor man thirty-five years her senior . " " No ? " " No . " Hatch glanced at Chester . " Fletcher , " he said , then , " have you ever heard of the famous Chester Erb case ? " Johnny nodded . " Young Chester Erb disappeared , twenty years ago . Go on . " " This , " said Martin Hatch , " is Chester Erb . " Johnny raised his eyebrows and shrugged blandly . A little frown came over Martin Hatch 's face . " You do n't seem surprised . " " I caught the similarity in names last night . Go on  --  with your proposition . " Chester Erb finally proved that his vocal chords were in existence . " Maybe we better talk this over , Marty . " Hatch frowned at Johnny . " How about it , Fletcher ? You want to string along with us ? "  | " That depends . You have n't told me your proposition yet . " Chester Erb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A pat on the back ? " " What has Wallace Erb offered you ? " " Nothing , " said Hatch . " That 's our point . He says Chester is a . . . well , an impostor . " " Are you ? " Johnny asked Chester directly . The man who called himself Chester Erb scowled . " I am like hell . My name 's Chester Erb and I can prove it . " " How ? " " That , " Hatch said , quickly , " is something we 'd rather not reveal at the moment . You 'll just have to take our word for it that Chester here is the missing Chester Erb and that we have definite proof of it . " " That 's fine , " said Johnny . " You 've got proof and you 're  --  well , I imagine you 're a lawyer . That 's all you need , is n't it ? All you 've got to do is convince a judge and maybe a jury . " " The point is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the treasury . We 've got to sue him here in this state , where Erb 's entrenched himself pretty solidly . He 's got several million dollars and if he wants to , he can stretch this out for years . Get postponements , delays . . . . " " That 's tough , " Johnny admitted , " and it 's the  | reason I never bother to sue anyone . Although why I 'd want to sue anyone I do n't know . " " We do n't want to sue , either , " Hatch said . " We 're willing to compromise with Erb , but he 's absolutely refused to listen to reason . You saw what he tried to pull last night ? " " Maybe I missed it . What did Erb try to pull ? " " We were out at his place . He listened mostly while we talked and did n't object too much . Then he said we 'd have dinner together and talk some more . He took us to that crap game , which he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do that ? " " So you 'd be broke and would n't be able to cause him so much trouble . " " Exactly , but thanks to your dice  --  loaded or not ? we came out with twice as much money as we went in . Ten grand . We can start suit against him , but ten grand is n't going to last us very long . That 's why we want you to throw in with us . Erb 's wife ? " " Hold it ! " Johnny cried . " Do n't ask me to try to coerce Erb 's wife over to your side  --  or get her to spill things she 's learned from her husband . " Chester Erb said , testily : " What 's wrong with that ? " Johnny pushed back his chair and got up . " Sorry , boys . I do n't play with you . "  | " Not even for ten per cent of a million bucks ? " Martin Hatch sneered . " A hundred grand ? What the devil would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellows ! " He left them sitting at the table . Outside he headed toward the poultry building , then changed his mind . Apparently Patricia Erb had not yet showed up , otherwise Sam Cragg would have been coming for him . Johnny decided that he wanted to see Mr. and Mrs. Wallace Erb in their native habitat  --  their home . There was a question he wanted to ask each of them ? separately . He climbed into the flivver and tooled it out of the fairgrounds . On the way back to Cedar City he suddenly remembered that he did not know the whereabouts of the Erb estate and stopped at a drugstore and looked it up in a phone directory . The book said merely : Cedar Road . Johnny asked the druggist : " How do I get out to Cedar Road ? " The druggist looked at him blankly . " Cedar Road ? I never heard of it . " " Well , do you happen to know where Wallace Erb lives ? " " Oh sure . Is his place on Cedar Road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodded .  | " You go right down this street out here until you cross the railroad tracks . Then you take the first street going left and go right out on it . " " How far ? " " Three-four miles . " " How 'll I know the place ? " " You 'll know . It 's the place ! " Johnny discovered that . He followed the druggist 's directions and ten minutes later stopped his car before an estate that would have been a landmark even in Westchester County , New York . The house was about a hundred yards back from the road . A motion picture actress would not have disdained to live in it . It was a two-story building , the lower half of field stone , the upper of frame . Neatly clipped lawns led up to it . They were split by a driveway of black macadam . Johnny drove up to the side of the house and climbed out of his flivver . A middle-aged man in a chauffeur 's uniform came up from a two-story garage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The barracks are over there , " he said , pointing to a long , low building a hundred yards behind the house .  | " Barracks ? " said Johnny . " Is this an army camp ? " " Of course not , but the help lives in the barracks . Who 're you looking for ? " " Wallace Erb ? Would he be in the barracks ? " The chauffeur looked again at the flivver . " What do you want with Mr. Erb ? " " None of your business , my good man , " Johnny retorted . " Just go and trot him out here , that 's all . " The chauffeur hesitated and at that moment Wallace Erb came out to the flagged veranda . Johnny called to him : " Hi , Mr. Erb . How 're you ? " The chauffeur retreated hastily to his garage . Wallace Erb strolled leisurely over to where Johnny was standing . " Hello , Fletcher , I imagine you 'll be buying a new car . " " Oh , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pleasantly . " Also a small Packard runabout . I just use this for the fairs . I 've found it does n't pay to let customers get the impression you 've got too much money . " Wallace Erb almost unbent sufficiently to grin . He caught himself in time , however . " Anything I can do for you , Fletcher ? " " Why , yes . I 've a friend who 's interested in buying a couple of pairs of good breeding foxes and I thought you might show me what you have . "  | " You saw those at the show . They swept the classes , you know . Five firsts of a possible six . " " That 's great , but my friend did n't exactly want show stock . Just run of the mill foxes , you know . Good breeders . . . . " " Very well . My foreman usually takes care of these things , but I do n't mind showing you around . " He started toward the rear of the estate and Johnny fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barracks building and Johnny had still not seen any foxes , he asked : " Where do you keep your animals ? " " Back here in the woods . You see , we try to have as near natural conditions for them as possible . There 're about six hundred acres of woods here . The breeders are kept in pens , of course , but the young stuff is allowed to run together . You should have been here a couple of weeks ago , before we pelted them . Then you would have seen something . Three thousand of the finest silver foxes in this country ? " Johnny exclaimed . " You skinned three thousand foxes ? " " Not quite . About twenty-five hundred . We retained five hundred for breeders . " " Twenty-five hundred and they 'll bring how much a skin ? " " I 'll learn that Saturday at the fur auction . There are a number of extremely fine pelts that should  | fetch two hundred dollars . The average will be considerably lower , however . Perhaps around forty dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be in the neighborhood of a hundred thousand dollars . Wow ! " " Expenses here are heavy . I 've a dozen men working most of the year . Sometimes more . " They had entered the edge of the woods now and Johnny discovered that a heavy , closely meshed fence , that he had not been able to see from the house , ran along the fringe of the trees . On the right and the left , other fences ran into the woods . Suddenly , a streak of black whizzed from behind a tree for the shelter of the thicker trees . Wallace Erb opened a gate . " Come along , " he invited . Johnny hesitated . " In there among the foxes ? " " They wo n't hurt you . They 're too frightened . Just do n't try to catch any of them and you 'll be all right . They 'll snap if you catch them . " With some trepidation Johnny followed Erb into the wired enclosure . As they moved farther in , other streaks of black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnny saw several small shelters here and there . Each had a round hole cut in it and a pair of beady eyes peered out of almost every hole .  | After they had gone a little way , Erb pointed ahead . " There are most of the young fellows . " They were huddled in a corner of the enclosure , trying to hide behind one another and not making a very successful job of it . Johnny guessed that there were two hundred of the little fellows , each as jittery as a squirrel whose nuts are being dug out of his hole by a bloodhound . " We wo n't frighten them by going closer , " Erb said . " What is it you wanted to know ? " " Eh ? Why . . . I just wanted to see the foxes . " " You saw better animals at the show . You did n't really come out here for that . " " All right , I did n't . I guess you know that I was arrested yesterday , Mr. Erb . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clear yet . Not until the police find out who really killed Orpington . " " You think perhaps I did it ? " Erb asked , mockingly . " No . I just do n't want to miss any bets . Do you mind telling me where you were Monday night , around eleven thirty ? " " In bed , probably . I do n't remember . " " You were at home ? " " Of course . " " Mrs. Erb was with you ? " Wallace Erb finally smiled . " No , I believe she was visiting some friends . I 'm afraid you 'll just have  | to take my word that I was home . The servants retired at ten . Had I known you were going to ask me I 'd have asked one of them to remain up and provide me with an alibi . " Johnny bit his lip . Erb was a master of sarcasm , his tone as well as his words conveying contempt and scorn . But Johnny took a deep breath and laid himself still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Erb  --  Martin Hatch and Chester ; who are they ? " " Their names are Chester and Hatch , " Erb said , pointedly . " Shall we go now ? " Johnny accepted the rebuke in silence . He trudged beside Erb to the clearing . But as they passed the barracks and approached the stone house , he took one more shot . " I understand Alfred Orpington telephoned you Monday night . " Johnny , watching , saw Erb 's jaws tense . But the fox breeder did not answer the question . Johnny gave up . They rounded the garage and Johnny exclaimed . Patricia Erb was just climbing into the flivver . He cried : " Good morning , Mrs. Erb ! " " Hi , Fletcher , " she said , saluting him . Today she was wearing a coat of beautiful cross-fox fur ;  | also a felt hat which had a scrap of fur trimming and a maroon feather . Wallace Erb said , coldly : " Irving will drive you to town , Patricia . " " I wo n't bother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's just leaving I 'll let him drop me at the Cattle Congress . " " I 'd be glad to , " Johnny said . " I 'm going there anyway . " Wallace Erb 's lips moved , but no words came from them . He nodded and walked toward the house , without bidding Johnny farewell . Johnny climbed in behind the wheel , stepped on the starter and whirled the car in a narrow circle . He zoomed it down the macadam driveway and turned onto the concrete slab a moment later . " I do n't think your husband likes this , " he said , then . " Phooey ! " retorted Patricia . " Lots of things he does I do n't like and what good does it do me ? " Johnny shook his head . " Things like this are often settled in Reno . " " That , " said Patricia , " would suit me fine . I 'll get a million-dollar settlement and go back to New York . I 'll marry for love , next time . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Sam Cragg wants his put on , too . "  | She looked sidewards at him , through long lashes . " How about Jessie Thompson ? " " VVhat about her ? " " I 've seen you looking at her . In that sort of . .. way . " " Yeah , and how 's she looked back ? Like I was the grocer boy . " " Ah , but that 's just her system . The cool , aloof type , you know . They get their men , just the same . Now take me , I 'm frank and direct . When I like a man I tell him . I like you , Johnny Fletcher ! " Johnny almost ran off the slab . " Hey ! " he cried . " Take it easy . You 're still married . You would n't want me to wake up some fine morning with a bullet through my skull . " " Not from Wallace . " " Why not ? Those strong silent men are danger-. ous when they let go . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't one in the house . " " With all those valuable foxes running around ? Say ! . .. " " Oh , the guards are armed , of course . But they never come into the house . But do n't try getting into the fox pens at night . The wire fence is charged you know . " Johnny frowned . They were getting into Cedar City and traffic was becoming heavy . He swung  | out to miss a coal truck , then said , suddenly : " Where were you Monday night , Patricia ? " He could feel her start . But he kept his eyes resolutely ahead . " I do n't get you  --  Johnny ! " Patricia said . " Why ? " " Are you a detective ? " He laughed . " Of course not . I sell books for a living . I 'm interested in this Orpington affair because I 'm mixed up in it . That 's all . " " But the police have the situation well in hand . Why worry yourself about it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Curiosity . I can no more resist sticking my nose into a mystery than you can help being beautiful . " She relented under his flattery . " But you might get your nose cut off , Johnny . It 's happened before . Why do n't you drop the whole thing ? " " Maybe I will , " said Johnny . " If you 'll tell me where you were Monday night . " Like a kitten her purring suddenly ceased and she showed her claws . " Drop me here , if you do n't mind . I 'll walk the rest of the way ! " " Sorry , " Johnny apologized swiftly . " No need of that . The fairgrounds are just ahead . " She wrapped her cross-fox fur about her and drew away from him , to the far side of the car . Johnny approached the fairgrounds gate and paid  | two admissions . When he parked near the officials ' parking space , Patricia Erb climbed out before he could help her . She walked off , swinging her hips . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What a long tail our cat 's got ! " he muttered . When he approached the poultry building , Sam Cragg , who had been loafing about near by , started swiftly toward him . " Johnny , where the devil have you been ? " " Looking at foxes . What 's the difference ? " " Because things 've been popping . Lieutenant Cantrell pinched the Thompson girl . " " Huh ? " Johnny was . bewildered . " Why 'd he do that ? " " Because he found a gun in a shipping coop belonging to the Thompsons . And it had her fingerprints on it . " Johnny gasped . " A thirty-two ? " Sam nodded . " A thirty-two . " Johnny groaned . " I must be getting old . Who 's here , now ? Her brother ? " " Naw , he went down to jail with them . He was madder'n hell , called Cantrell all sorts of names and almost got smacked down . " " Let 's go a round with Cantrell . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the jail , Johnny . We 'll wind up in the clink , ourselves .  | We 're only one jump ahead of Cantrell , anyway . Besides  --  I think he 's got something up his sleeve . He was asking about you . " " Good , then we 've got an excuse to see him . Come on . " At the police station , Lieutenant Cantrell came out of the chief 's office and signaled to Johnny and Sam . They followed him in . " I guess your stooge told you , " Cantrell said . " Stooge ! " scowled Sam . Johnny signaled to him . He said to Chief Fleishacker , rather than Cantrell : " I suppose you have a ballistics expert in this town ? " Fleishacker beamed . " Sure , this is a high-class police department . We got a fingerprint man , a ballistics man and a Bertil . . . Bertil . . . yon man . Why ? " Johnny jerked his head toward Lieutenant Cantrell . " He found a gun with Miss Thompson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the bullet found in Orpington . Do n't jump to conclusions just because it happens to be a thirty-two . " The chief said to Cantrell : " How about that , Cantrell ? " Cantrell nodded . " I 've turned the gun over to Pete Rousseau . He 's promised to give me a report in a half hour . Ought to be ready now . " " I 'll call him , " said the chief . He picked up his  | telephone and asked for a number . A moment later he said : " Hello , Rousseau ? Chief Fleishacker . What 'd you find out ? What ? . . . " Johnny saw the astonishment leap into the chief 's eyes . He nodded , grimly . " You sure ? " Fleishacker bellowed into the phone . " You did n't make no mistake ? All right , all right ! " He slammed the receiver on the hook . His forehead creased , Cantrell looked inquiringly at him . " Did you mix up those bullets , Lieutenant ? " Fleishacker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself , as the doc gave them to me . That should n't make any difference , however . They were both fired from the same gun . " " No ! " bellowed the chief . " Rousseau swears they were fired from two different guns . That 's the hell of it . Both the same caliber and make , but different guns . " " That 's impossible ! " cried Cantrell . " The fox was killed by the same person who killed Orpington . " " Yeah ? " sneered Chief Fleishacker . " Well , get held of yourself and listen some more . A bullet fired from Miss Thompson 's thirty-two matches . . . the one taken from the fox ! " Even Johnny Fletcher exclaimed this time . But the lieutenant was staggered . " The fox ! . . . " he cried . " But . . . but the other bullet . . .. "  | " No . Rousseau says he 'll swear in any court that that bullet does n't match with any fired from Thompson 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " goes your case . And I hope Miss Thompson sues you for false arrest . " Lieutenant Cantrell glared angrily at Johnny . " But she killed the fox . That proves she was in your room herself . Why ? " Johnny rolled his eyes piously . " Sorry , mister . Being a gentleman I ca n't answer that . " Cantrell snarled . " You mean to tell me you and her ? " " Lieutenant ! " said Johnny sharply . " Please . Remember you 're an officer and a gentleman . "  | Chapter Fourteen Eating dinner that evening , Johnny Fletcher said to Sam Cragg : " Have plenty of dessert , because we 're going on a trip . To Chicago . " Sam gulped . " Chicago ? You mean now ? . . . " " The minute we leave this restaurant . We 'll drive all night and get there in the morning , just in time to do some investigating . " Sam drew a deep breath . Then exhaled heavily . " All right , Johnny . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  okay , pal . Chicago , here we come ! " And toward Chicago they rolled that night , through the cornfields of Iowa , the farms of Illinois . It was a few minutes after eight in the morning when Johnny stopped the car in front of a saloon on Madison , near Kedzie . " We 'll get a glass of beer , " he told Sam , " and take a peek at the old telephone directory . " They entered the place , ordered beer and Johnny asked for the directory . The bartender brought it to him . Johnny ruffled through the pages until he came to the H 's . " H-a , " he muttered , " Ha-a-m , H-a-y . . . yeah , Hayes , whew ! "  | Sam looking over Johnny 's shoulder , said : " There 's a whole column of them . " " But only five Jameses . All right , Sam , go over to the telephone and call them up . Ask whatever James Hayes you get , if he went to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got some nickels from the bartender and entered the telephone booth . Johnny meanwhile went through the telephone directory in search of the Fitzgeralds . He discovered that there were as many Fitzgeralds as Hayes ! There were no Archies or Archibalds . One name , however , had the initials A. M. Johnny wrote down the street address and telephone number . Then he had another beer while Sam was completing his calls . Sam came out of the phone booth , wiping his forehead with a handkerchief . " No soap , Johnny . " " What do you mean ? None ever went to the Larchwood Junior High ? " Sam went down his list . " Number one never went to high school at all and he 's fifty-five years old ? " " Too old . Go on . " " Number two says he graduated from the Lane Technical High . Number three was n't home . Number four 's wife answered and thought I was one of  | her husband 's drunken friends . She gave me hell for keeping Jim out last night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did he go to Larchwood High ? " " No , he went to school in Oshkosh , Wisconsin . They only moved to Chicago five years ago . Number five  --  died six months ago and his family has kept the phone in his name . " " That leaves us number three , who did n't answer . We 'll try him later . Now , call this number here . Ask A. M. Fitzgerald if his first name is Archibald . " Sam trotted again to the telephone booth . He came out within thirty seconds . " His name 's Angus . " " Damn it , " Johnny snapped irritably . " This is tougher than I figured it would be . " " What can you expect after twenty years , Johnny ? Folks do n't always stay put that long . How about yourself ? And me ? . . . I was brought up in Idaho and I ai n't been there since I was sixteen . " " I know , I know . Well , I guess we 've got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we ca n't pick up the trail there . Come on . " Again in the car , Johnny directed Sam to turn left on Kedzie . They rolled north to Diversey , then turned east until they crossed Clark Street . They made another turn south then , and after a moment Johnny pointed to a huge building . " There it is , " he said ; " but that building is n't  | more'n three or four years old . Anyway , we 'll give it a whirl . " They had difficulty finding a parking place , but finally managed to squeeze in between a couple of cars . It was shortly after nine and the thousands of students were in their classrooms . They entered the office and found a door on which there was a brass plate , reading : ADMINISTRATION . They found themselves in an office that was as modern as any business office . Johnny gave a reasonably truthful explanation of their mission to a young man who said he was the assistant principal . " We 're private investigators trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something like twenty years ago . " " That was before my time , " the assistant principal replied . " Naturally , however , we have records going back must farther than that . What were the students ' names ? " Johnny told him . " James Fitzgerald , Archie Hayes and  --  Chester Erb . " " Chester Erb ? " the assistant principal exclaimed . " You mean  --  the boy who disappeared ? " " That 's right . " " Who are you representing in this ? " " I ca n't tell that , " Johnny said . " Except that it 's ? one of the principals . " " Oh ! " The assistant principal pursed up his lips ,  | then finally shrugged and went to a row of card files . " Let 's see , that was 1919 , was n't it ? Yes , here 's the file . Ummm . . . . " He pulled out a drawer and ran over a long tray of cards . " Chester Erb , " he said , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What did you want to know about him ? " " Nothing . The newspapers covered Chester pretty thoroughly . It 's Hayes and Fitzgerald I 'm interested in . They were Chester 's closest friends . " " Yes , I remember . Let 's see , here 's James Hayes ' card . But there 's nothing on it , except his address and the names of his father and mother . " " That 's what I want . " Johnny took out an old envelope from his pocket and wrote down the information . " James F. Hayes , 419 Webster . " A moment later he added : " Archibald Cedric Fitzgerald , 2214 Sedgwick . " Before the assistant principal closed the file , Johnny added : " Chester Erb , 2312 Waldorf Court . " " Thanks a lot , " he said . " I do n't suppose you can tell me anything about either of these boys . Their present whereabouts ? " The assistant principal shook his head . " No , I 'm sorry . Students seldom keep their high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . I only happen to remember Chester Erb 's name because of the continual mention of it in the  | newspapers during all these years . I 'd forgotten the names of Hayes and Fitzgerald . " " How about the principal ? Would he remember them ? " " No , he came to this school after I did  --  only three years ago . He 's from St. Louis . " " Their old teachers ? " The assistant principal brightened . " The English prof ! I 'll bet he 's been in this school thirty-five years ! " " Could I talk to him ? " Johnny asked eagerly . " Of course . Miss Meadows , would you ask Professor Ehrlich to step in here a moment ? " A secretary got up from behind her desk and went out of the room . She returned in a little while with a stooped , gray-haired man well in his sixties . " Professor Ehrlich , " the assistant principal said , " this is Mr. Fletcher , an investigator . " " How do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . " I 'll be happy to tell you whatever I can . What is it you wished to know ? " " Why , I want to get some information on some boys who may have been in your classes about twenty years ago . In 1919 . Chester Erb .... " The old man 's eyes lit up . " Yes ! I remember him very well . Unfortunate tragedy .... " " What sort of a boy was he ? " " What kind of student ? " Professor Ehrlich shook  | his head . " I 'm afraid he was n't very good in English . Although a boy I had one year , named Higgins , who got F 's more consistently than any student I had in years is now the famous Morgan Higgins ' whose latest novel was rather highly praised by the critics . So you see . " Uh-huh , " Johnny grunted . " But about this Chester Erb ; he was n't so good in English . But what can you tell me about him , otherwise ? His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As I recall him , he was rather slight . Moody , but not necessarily because he was thoughtful . He was n't at all . Well , I should n't say so after his tragic end , but he  --  well , he was n't the sort of boy I 'd trust ? " " In what way ? Did he swipe apples from other kids ? " " He did n't have to . His family was very wealthy . It was just that he was rather evasive . And he did n't always tell the truth about things . " " I see . Well , look , Professor , do you remember a couple of Chester 's classmates ? Jimmy Hayes ? " " Jimmy Hayes ! " exclaimed the professor . " Now , there was a boy . One of the most brilliant I ever had . He undoubtedly went far . " " You do n't know what became of him ? " " Unfortunately , no . But I 'm convinced that wherever he is , he 's very successful . Aside from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classes consistently  --  Jimmie Hayes was a natural born leader . I believe he was considered a very able athlete , also . Football , you know . . . . " " He ought to be easy to find , then , " Johnny commented . " Now about one more boy . . . . Archibald Fitzgerald . . . . " The professor did n't remember him so well . But after screwing up his eyes a while he nodded . " Yes , Archibald . No . . . I 'm sorry , but I ca n't say as much for him . In fact , I remember he was an even poorer student than young Chester . I may be wrong , as the boy did n't make much of an impression on me . That however , seems to bear out my contention . I remember the bright students . " " That 's natural , Professor . Well , thanks a lot ! You too , Principal . " Johnny left the school and rejoined Sam , who had climbed out of the flivver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a near-by window . " How 'd you make out , Johnny ? " " So-so . Anyway , I got their addresses , as of 1919 . All we have to do is run them down , now . " Sam groaned . " Could n't we have another beer first ? " " No , this requires a clear head . Come on , pile into the bus . " Webster was one block south . They turned right  | and consulted the house numbers . 419 was a rundown two-story brick building , which had a printing plant on the first floor . There were two flats upstairs . One was occupied by a family named Jablonski . The woman who answered Johnny 's knock on the door could scarcely speak English . A pimply faced youth of about sixteen opened the door of the other flat . " We only been living here a year , " he told Johnny . " Naw , I never heard of no Hayes around here . " Johnny went downstairs to the printing shop . They had occupied their quarters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenants above , did not even know the names of the present ones . Johnny returned to the fliver and discovered that Sam was missing . Irritably , he pressed the horn and Sam popped out of the saloon across the street , wiping his mouth . " Damn it , Sam , " he snapped when his friend came across the street . " I told you to lay off that . " " Sure , but I been doing some investigating , Johnny . The old coot who runs that joint 's lived around here all his life . . . . " Johnny muttered under his breath and started across the street . Sam followed . " The old coot " was about fifty and weighed five times his age . " What 'll it be , gents ? " he said , wiping  | the bar with a towel that had an odor of stale beer strong enough to asphyxiate a man . " Two beers , " Johnny said , " and some talk . My pal tells me you 've lived around here all your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bartender , drawing two beers , " I been in the saloon business thirty years . During prohibition we had curtains in the windows . " " Remember the Hayes family who lived across the street about twenty years ago ? " " Do I remember Mickey Hayes ? " exclaimed the bartender . " Sure and it was a sad day when he was hit by a streetcar . My best customer . . . . " " Mickey had a son named Jimmie . . . . " Johnny prompted . " Yeah , sure , a bright boy he was , too ... " Was ? You mean he 's dead ? " " Is he ? And that 's a shame ! " " I did n't say he was dead ! " exclaimed Johnny . " I asked you if he was . You said was . " " Was what ? " Johnny gritted his teeth . " You said he was a bright boy . You spoke of him in the past tense . " " Sure . He was a bright boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . That was twenty years ago . " Johnny gulped some of his beer , to cool off . Then he tried again . " Take it slow , now . What became of Jimmie Hayes ? Do you know ? " " Sure , I know . Was n't his old man me best cus-  | tomer ? A fine old man even if he did drink a drop too much now and then . ' Specially on Saturday nights , when he had his pay with him . " Johnny roared : " What became of Jimmie ? " " Jimmie ? I can hear you . You do n't have to holler like that . Jimmie was a mighty fine lad , bright as a polished spittoon . Would n't be a bit surprised if he 's even got to be an alderman , somewhere . " " Do n't you know ? " " Of course I know . I been tellin ' you . Jimmie was a bright boy ? " Sam said : " Fill ' em up again , Paddy ! And while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yours think about Jimmie Hayes . We want to know where he lives now  --  today , not twenty years ago . Today , see ! " " Today ? Well , why did n't you say so ? Whaddya keep beatin ' around the bush . I do n't know . " Johnny groaned . " You do n't know ? Where Jimmie Hayes lives today ? " " That 's what I 'm tellin ' you . Him and his ma moved away after the old man was killed by walkin ' in front of a streetcar when he had a drop too much . " Johnny contemplated heaving the beer mug through the nicely decorated back-bar mirror . He controlled himself with an effort . " I 'll give you one more chance , " he said , grimly .  | " Archibald Fitzgerald , who lived right around the corner on Sedgwick Street . Would you ? ? " " Mr. Fitzgerald ! " cried the saloon keeper . " Now , there 's a man ye can be proud of . Maybe he did squeeze a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money and he got somewhere with it . " Johnny regarded the bartender darkly . " Where did he get ? " " Are you joking ? You mean to say you never heard of Mister Archibald Fitzgerald , him that 's so rich and made it all in the stock market when everybody was losing their shirts ? ? including meself who took a little flyer in Gramatan Silver and had to borrow from the brewery to keep goin ' ? " " Hold it , " snapped Johnny . " Archibald Fitzgerald made his pile in the stock market . He 's still got it and you know where he lives ? That 's all clear ? " " Of course . Mr. Fitzgerald 's a big man . Everybody knows him . " " Where does he live ? " " I do n't know . But anybody can tell you . " " Who 's anybody ? " " Why the stock market , or the board of trade , or wherever they do their business . Everybody knows Mr. Archibald Fitzgerald , him that was Little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telephone directory ? " Johnny asked , bluntly . " Sure , right under the bar . A red book , too . " " Let me have that . " On a hunch Johnny turned the pages of the red book to Stockbrokers . And there it was : " Archibald Fitzgerald &; Company , Board of Trade Building . " " Now your phone ! " The saloonkeeper pointed to a wall instrument at the end of the bar . Johnny strode to it , dropped in a nickel and dialed the ' number given in the directory . A girl 's crisp voice , said : " Archibald Fitzgerald and Company . " " Let me talk ' to Archie Fitzgerald . " " I 'm sorry , he 's out to lunch . Would you care to talk to his secretary ? " " Yes . Put her on . A moment later he said to a different voice , " This is an old school chum of Archie Fitzgerald 's . Can you tell me where I can get in touch with him ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Athletic Club . He should be there for another half hour or so . " " Thanks ! " Johnny slammed the receiver on the hook and ran for the door . " Come on , Sam ! "  | Chapter Fifteen Across the street they piled into the flivver and a few minutes later were turning into Lincoln Park . Fifteen minutes later they were dodging in and out of cars in The Loop searching for a parking space . Johnny finally gave up . " I 'm going into the club there , " he pointed to a tall building , " you find a parking place somewhere and meet me outside the joint . " " How long 'll you be ? " " I do n't know . Wait for me . I may even be finished before you show up . " He dropped off in front of the club building and gave the doorkeeper a dollar . " Archie Fitzgerald 's having lunch here . Will you have him paged and tell him an old friend of his wants to see him ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's why I 'm giving you the dollar , " Johnny retorted . The doorkeeper shrugged . He permitted Johnny to sit down on a bench in the cubicle just inside the door while he went into the lobby and talked with the bell captain .  | He returned to the door . " It may take a few minutes . " It took five minutes and then the bellboy and the doorkeeper got into a huddle . The doorkeeper came over to Johnny , shaking his head . " Sorry , sir , but Mr. Fitzgerald is engaged . " Exasperated , Johnny took another dollar from his pocket . " Take me up to him . " The doorkeeper was horrified .. " Take you into the grill room ? Oh , we could n't do that . You 're not a member of this club ! " Angrily , Johnny drew out his entire roll and peeled off a twenty-dollar bill . " That ought to make me a member , for five minutes ! " The doorkeeper took the money , added it to the dollar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried the one dollar bill into the lobby . He returned after a moment with a bellboy . " Jack will point out Mr. Fitzgerald . " Johnny followed the elevator boy into the swank lobby , to the elevators . They rode to the third floor , passed through a huge billiard room in which a number of anemic-looking men were knocking balls around in an extremely amateurish manner . The grill room was beyond the billiard room and Jack , the elevator boy , stopped at the entrance . " That third table against the wall with the two guys . The fella with the red fuzz around his ears is Fitz-  | gerald . Go to it . You 're on your own . I 'll catch you as you come out . " " That wo n't be necessary , Jack , " Johnny said , grimly . Johnny worked his way into the grill room until he came to the table where the man with the red fuzz around his ears was talking to a white-haired man who looked like a banker . Johnny passed Archie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulder . " Why , Archie Fitzgerald , you old so and so ! " Fitzgerald choked and coughed into his ice cream dessert . Then he glared angrily at Johnny . " Who are you , sir ? " he demanded . The fuzz over his ears was red , but the rest of his head was completely bald . And the pate was red . He was an irritable man who looked forty-five , although Johnny knew he could not be more than thirty-five . He chuckled at Fitzgerald . ' Why , do n't you remember me , Archie ? We went to school together . Years ago . Larchwood High , remember ? " " Larchwood High ? " Fitzgerald scowled . " I do n't remember you ? " " Oh , come , come ! " Johnny said , impatiently . " Surely you remember the gang , Butch Wilson , Jimmie Hayes  --  and Chester Erb ? "  | A gleam of recognition came into Fitzgerald 's eyes . " You 're not . . Butch Wilson ? " ' " Ha-ha ! Guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Give up ? " Fitzgerald bobbed his head up and down peevishly . " I 'm Chester Erb ! " Fitzgerald gulped and half rose to his feet . " Chester . . . Erb ! " he cried . " Remember me ? " Fitzgerald sat down abruptly . " You 're not Chester Erb . " " No , " said Johnny . " I 'm not . But I 'd like to talk to you about him . Have you got five minutes ? " Archibald Fitzgerald bit his lip . Then he looked across the table at the white-haired man . " Do you mind , Judge ? " The judge rose hastily . " Not at all , Mr. Fitzgerald . I 've got to get back to the office , anyway . Er . . . and would you see what you can do about that matter , sir ? " The deference of the white haired " judge " to the man who as a boy had , been " the dumbest kid in Larchwood High School " struck Johnny as ironic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . " I was over at Larchwood High an hour ago , Mr. Fitzgerald , " he said . " I talked to Professor Ehrlich .... "  | Fitzgerald grimaced . " Is he still alive ? " " And well . He spoke very highly of you . " Fitzgerald brightened . " Is that so ? I would n't have thought it . As I remember ? " " He said you were the dumbest kid he ever had in his classes .... " Fitzgerald 's face suddenly matched the red fuzz about his ears . " Get to the point , sir ! I have an important engagement . . . . " " Sure , sure , " Johnny said easily . " I understand you 're a very busy man . " " I am . " " All I want to ask you are a couple of questions about Chester Erb . " Fitzgerald looked sharply at Johnny . " What 's your interest in him ? " " I 'm a private investigator . I was talking to Chester 's uncle only yesterday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working for him ? " Johnny did not say yes and he did not say no . He shrugged and said : " I 've checked over the entire case . Including your statements to the police at the time . . " " That 's ancient history . I guess everybody in the United States heard what I told the police . Which was n't much . I left Chester on the corner  | near his house and that was the last time I ever saw him . " " Right . You repeated it when you were questioned the second time . But then you said something you had n't the first time . That Chester was angry at his father and had threatened to run away . " " I do n't remember that , " said Fitzgerald . " As far as I knew , Chester was no different from any other kid except that his family had money . They lived over on Waldorf Place , which was a good street in those days . Jimmie and I lived around Sedgwick and Webster . Our families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Did n't it strike you , therefore , as strange that Chester , whose family was so rich should want to run away from home , whereas you and Jimmie Hayes , whose families were poor were perfectly content to live with them ? " " You did n't know Chester ! " " Ah ! " said Johnny , " now we 're getting somewhere . I did n't know Chester . But I want to know him . What sort of boy was he  --  moody , thoughtful ? . . . " A faint smile crossed Archie Fitzgerald 's face . " I guess you might say he was a thoughtful kid . But his thoughts were n't generally the sort that would improve his mind . He was usually thinking out some new kind of devilment . " " Oh-ho ! Now , at last , it comes out . Chester  | was n't the sweet , innocent boy his family made him out to be . " " They might have thought that . Families never know what their own children are like . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our school , with perhaps one exception  --  Jimmie Hayes . Chester 's father had money . . . but he was n't giving it to Chester in those days . That did n't bother Chester any , though . He was ingenious . He knew all sorts of ways to make money . Like that scale business ? " " Scale business ? " " Yes , those **29;710;TOOLONG scales . Used to be a lot of them in those days . You turned a knob to what you think you weigh , then you put in a penny . If you guess within two pounds , your penny comes back . . . only most people never got them around our neighborhood . Chester got them . " Johnny grunted . " He plugged up the bottom of the return chute , eh ? " Fitzgerald nodded . " With a small wad of paper . He had a regular route of the scales . Sometimes he made as much as two dollars a day . " " And he did n't cut you fellows in ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . you know how kids are . Yes , we did split . But it was Chester who started the business . And when he tried it on the telephones ? "  | " Ha ! He worked up into nickels ? " " It was n't very successful . Some druggist got suspicious and watched . He caught Chester and reported it to the telephone company . They went to Chester 's father . I guess that was why Chester wanted to run away from home . His father whaled the tar out of him . " " You did n't tell that to the police ! " Fitzgerald shrugged . " I did n't see what point there 'd be in it . " " You mean you were afraid that telephone and scale business would come out and you 'd be im-plicated ? " Fitzgerald scowled . Johnny changed the subject . " Did you know Chester 's uncle , Wallace Erb ? " " I met him during the investigation . Never saw him before . " " What 's your opinion of him ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fitzgerald . " Wallace Erb is a member of this club . " " This club ? But he does n't live here ? " " No , but he 's a member just the same . Comes here when he 's in Chicago . I understand he 's rather well fixed . " " Why not ? He inherited the Erb estate . By the way , what did you think of Chester 's father , Chester Senior ? "  | " My impression of him was favorable . Perhaps a bit on the stern side , but viewing him at this late date , I would say he had to be stern . He was a self-made man you know , like . . . er , well , my-self ! " " Quite so . You 've done very well , Mr. Fitzgerald . I was talking to McGonigle who still runs a saloon on Webster and he told me about you as a boy . And Jimmie Hayes . Have you seen Jimmie lately ? " Fitzgerald shook his head . " Not in years . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Worked his way through , I believe . I was n't fortunate enough to attend college . " " It has n't hurt you any , though . I imagine you 've done as well as Hayes , without benefit of a university education . " Fitzgerald 's mouth twisted . " What makes you think Jim Hayes succeeded so well ? " " Why , every one speaks so highly of him . Professor Ehrlich said he was the most brilliant student he ever had . And McGonigle  --  although I would n't say he was any judge . . . . Anyway he worked his way through college , which speaks well for him . " Fitzgerald grunted . " The last I heard of Jim he was working for the telephone company . I think he called himself an engineer or something , but from  | the way he was dressed when I met him , it 's more likely he was a linesman or laborer . . . . " " Engineers wear rough clothes . Boots and wool shirts , you know . Maybe he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I doubt it . I 'd have heard of him . " " How long since you saw him ? " " Oh , eight or ten years ago . " Johnny nodded . He started to get up , then asked another question . " So it 's your theory that Chester Erb just ran away from home ? " " No , " Fitzgerald said , surprisingly . " I have an altogether different theory . " Johnny leaned forward . If any man could make a reasonably accurate guess as to the motive behind the disappearance of Chester Erb , it was this man , who had been one of his two closest friends . Fitzgerald moistened his lips with his tongue and his eyes puckered in thought . Then he shook his head . " No , " he said . " No , what ? " " I ca n't say anything . " " What harm would there be in merely expressing a theory ? One million people have expressed theories on the Erb case at one time or another . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back his chair . " Well , thanks , anyway , Mr. Fitzgerald . "  | " You 're welcome , I 'm sure . " Johnny left the Midwest Athletic Club and found Sam Cragg outside . " I 've cut the time in half , Sam , " he told his friend . " Jimmie Hayes worked for the telephone company eight or ten years ago . Let 's go over and see if he 's still there . " He was n't . And after they had been shunted from department to department for a half hour , Johnny learned that Jim Hayes had been let out during a general layoff in 1932 . He had not been re-employed later . By bribing a frozen-faced spinster with twenty dollars , Johnny obtained Jim Hayes ' last known address : The Royal Crown Hotel on North Avenue .. They drove to the Royal Crown Hotel , a fourthrate rat trap . They remembered Jim Hayes there . Yes , he 'd lived at the Royal Crown for two or three years . He 'd left in 1932 , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remained for six months . He had finally checked out in January 1934 . The landlord did not know where Hayes had moved , but thought Johnny might get some information at the cigar store on the corner . Joe Green might know . The landlord did n't say , but Johnny gathered that Joe Green ran a handbook on the side and that Jim Hayes patronized it . Joe Green was a greasy , shifty-eyed man who  | knew the answers . He was chewing one of his own fat cigars . " Jim Hayes ? " he said . " Never heard of him . " Johnny groaned . " He used to lay some bets with you ? " " What the hell you talking about ? " Green snapped . " Do I look like a bookie ? " Johnny glanced toward a door at the rear of the shop . The door was n't thick enough to quite drown out voices . " Yes , " he snapped . " I think you run a wire house back there . " Joe Green almost bit his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to think of it , now , I remember this Hayes fellow . Big , strapping fellow . Used to stop in for his cigarettes . But I ai n't seen him in three-four years . " " He would n't be in back there now ? " " No . Uh  --  there 's no one in back there . Now , look , I 'm running a cigar store here and Julius Shlager the committeeman 's a friend of mine and ? " " Relax , pal ! Relax . I 'm not a cop . " " Private dick ? " Johnny shrugged . " I 'm not going to finger Jim Hayes . All I want from him is  --  an address . He once knew a man I 'm interested in and I thought he might still know him and give me his address . " " Sorry , I ca n't help you . I ai n't seen Jim in a year . "  | " You said two or three years ago a minute ago ! " " Did I ? Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned to Sam Cragg . " Sam , what was the name of that horse in the fourth today ? " " At Santa Anita ? Miss Lizzie . She 'll pay twelve dollars ... " Johnny nodded . He drew his roll from his pocket and exhibited it to Joe Green , flicking bills so the cigar store man could see the denominations . " You could n't tell me where I could lay a bit on Miss Lizzie , could you ? " Greed struggled with caution on Joe Green 's greasy face . " Uh . . . uh . . . . No , I could n't . " Johnny peeled off five one-hundred-dollar bills . " I 'd like to lay that on Miss Lizzie 's nose . " Joe Green perspired furiously . " Julius Shlager , the committeeman ? " " ? is a pal of yours . So it would n't do me any good to go to the cops , anyway . Well , how about it ? " Green surrendered . " All right , I 'll take the money . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to Johnny . " Okay ? " " Okay . Now , where does Jim Hayes hang his hat ? " " He used to have a room on Halsted Street . About a block from here . Mrs. Kemper 's place . The  | number 's 1778 . But do n't let on where you got it , huh ? " " I wo n't . I 'll be back here this evening to collect that bet . " " Maybe , " said Green . " Miss Lizzie 's out of her class in that race . " " She 'll show those goats her heels , " Sam defended Miss Lizzie . Number 1778 Halsted Street was a three-story brick building , whose . better days had been before the turn of the century . Johnny shook his head as he regarded the building . " The boy most likely to succeed . . . . " he murmured . He rang the doorbell and a stout , rather sloppy woman opened the door . She looked sourly at Johnny and Sam . " You 're looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I want to see Jim Hayes . " Mrs. Kemper sniffed . " Von of his friendt 's , poo ! Vell , go ahead . " " He 's at home ? " " Sure , v'y not ? He 's got no place to go , has he ? Except mebbe the poolroom . " They walked down a dingy hall that had a thousand smells . Johnny rapped on the door of Jim Hayes ' room . A voice inside , called : " Come in or stay out ! " Johnny pushed open the door and looked into  | the room about eight by ten . A big fellow lay on a bed that sagged almost to the floor . He was wearing a soiled shirt , patched baggy pants . A cigarette was stuck in his mouth and the room was thick with smoke . He looked at Johnny and Sam without lifting his head from the pillow . " Yeah ? " he said . " You 're Jim Hayes . . . . " " So what ? If you 're selling something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking to an old schoolteacher of yours a while ago . Professor Ehrlich of Larchwood High ... " Jim Hayes took the cigarette from his mouth and lifted his head . He leaned over and rubbed out the cigarette on the floor . Then he suddenly fell back to the bed . " Old Professor Ehrlich ! " He laughed harshly . " He said you were the brightest kid in your class . " " Sure I was , " Hayes admitted . " That was n't anything . I worked my way through Northwestern . They voted me the man most likely to succeed . " The bitterness in Hayes ' tone appalled Johnny . He said : " I guess the breaks were kinda tough ! " " Breaks ! " sneered Jim Hayes . " A man makes his own breaks . " Johnny said , softly : " A woman ! . .. "  | He saw Jim Hayes stiffen and knew that he had sent his barb straight to where it hurt most . Jim Hayes said : " A woman , what the hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go into your song and dance . What 've you got ? " " Well , " said Johnny , " to cut a long story short , I 'm investigating the disappearance of Chester Erb . " Jim Hayes sat up in bed and put his feet on the floor . Then he looked up at Johnny . " Are n't you a bit late for that ? About twenty years . " " Maybe . Maybe not . Chester Erb did n't just go up into smoke , did he ? And his disappearance has never been satisfactorily explained . " " But why bother about it now ? Unless . . . his uncle shoved off and there 's a few million dollars around looking for an heir . No  --  I guess there would n't be . Pat would have them . " " Pat ? You mean Patricia Erb ? " A tingle ran through Johnny . He had struck gold bearing ore , two inches wide and running right into the mountain . " Yep , " said Jim Hayes . " Patsy Springer who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a heart of gold . And just as hard and cold . " " You know her ? " Johnny prodded . " I bought her her first fur coat . I was still paying for it , when she married Joel Collins , who took her to New York and bought her into a show . Do I know Patsy Springer ! "  | " I guess you do , " Johnny admitted . " She 's as beautiful as ever . " " You 've seen her  --  lately ? " " Yesterday . " " Here in town ? She 's here ? " " No . I saw her at her home . In Cedar City , Iowa . " " Oh ! " Jim Hayes took out a limp pack of cigarettes , offered them to Sam and Johnny , then took one for himself . He lit it and tossed the match to the floor without putting it out . " Well , what 's this about Chester ? Who 's looking for him ? Not Patsy 's husband , Wallace ? He would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As a matter of fact , " said Johnny . " No one seems interested in finding Chester Erb  --  except myself . " " What 's your interest in him ? " " Curiosity . I 've read about the case for years and worked out a theory about his disappearance . " " There 're a million theories about Chester Erb , " scoffed Jim Hayes . " Maybe half of them are right . Who knows , or will ever know ? " " Do n't you ? " " Me ? " snorted Hayes . " If I 'd known twenty years ago I 'd have told Chester 's father . He offered a reward of fifty thousand , you know . "  | " Archie Fitzgerald has a theory , " Johnny said , suddenly . Jim Hayes almost grinned . " You 've met Archie ? He 's in the chips . " " He seemed to be . I understand you three  --  Erb , Fitzgerald and yourself , were pals . " " Not Archie . Well , Ches and I let him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly a pal of ours . How could you be pals with a fellow who 'd rather put a nickel in his toy bank than buy an ice cream cone ? " " Yet he was in on the **28;741;TOOLONG business ? " " Oh , that . Yeah , I guess that was Archie 's idea . " " He said it was Chester 's . " " Maybe it was . I do n't remember . More likely though it was Archie 's . Ches did n't usually think in terms of pennies . He liked dollars . It was Ches ' idea though that finally got him into trouble with that druggist . " " Plugging up the return chute in the telephones ? This druggist caught Chester and reported him . " " Yeah , Ches tried to buy his way out of it . Gave the fellow ten bucks and Orpington kept it and turned Ches over to the cops ? " " Orpington ? " exclaimed Sam Cragg . " Say , ai n't that ? ? " Johnny silenced Sam with a look , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You fellows know Orpington ? " " That was the name of the druggist who turned Chester over to the cops . Whatever became of him ? " Jim Hayes shrugged . " Search me . He had a dinky drugstore over on Center Street , but I guess he closed it up years ago . Guess he went broke . Why ? . . . " " No reason , " said Johnny . " Except that a man named Orpington was killed in Cedar City , Iowa , three days ago . " Hayes exclaimed . " A little guy about thirty-five , forty ? " " Oh , no . This man was in his fifties . " Hayes grimaced . " Yeah , sure , I was thinking of how he used to look . He 'd been close to sixty now , I guess . His first name was Albert . . . . " " Alfred . But he was n't a druggist . He was a fox breeder . " " He could have gone into that after he quit the drugstore business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Patsy lives now . That 's funny . " " Murder is n't funny , " said Johnny . " But it 's a coincidence . The girl you loved ? " " Hey ! " protested Jim Hayes . " I did n't say I loved her ? " " But you bought her her first fur coat . Later she married the uncle of your best boyhood friend , who  | disappeared after getting into some trouble with Alfred Orpington , who in turn is murdered in the home town of the boy 's uncle . " " The long arm of coincidence , " said Jim Hayes . " But you can count Patsy Erb out of that . She did n't know Wallace in those days . She comes from Wisconsin . I met her in school . She was a freshman when I was a senior . In fact , she never was more than a freshman for she was flunked out when I graduated . She did n't meet Erb until several years later . And that was in New York . " " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that was after Patsy had married and divorced Collins . She played in some shows , then sang in night clubs . Erb was quite a boy for the bright lights and spent a lot of time in New York . There 's no coincidence that he met Patsy and fell for her . Patsy was a looker . " " Is , " corrected Johnny . " How long has she been married to Erb ? " " Umm , let 's see . She 's about three years younger than I. I was twenty-two when I met her . She married Collins two years later and stuck to him about two years more . That would make her about twenty-three when she divorced Collins . Well , she played the field for a couple of years more before she married Erb . Erb was a fast worker ; he could  | be with his money . So they 've been married about five years , now . And she 's still living with him ? " " She was , up to yesterday . " " That old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Sam and grinned . " She 's still got the eye , though . What she needs is a man who 'll slap her ears down every time she looks at another man . I should have done that myself . " " If you had you might have married her and become as rich as Archie Fitzgerald . By the way , Hayes , could you use a sawbuck or two ? " " No . I 'd only put it on some horse that 'd turn out to have the heaves . I get enough to get by . " " What do you mean , get ? " Hayes grinned . " Well , I was on the W.P.A. and they let me out when they tossed off all us fellows who 'd been on for eighteen months . So what 'd we do  --  we went on relief . The only thing that I 've got to worry about now is the third term . I 'm good until then , anyway . " " Oh , " said Johnny . " Do n't worry about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always get by . I was n't the brightest boy in school for nothing . " " Shall I give Patsy Erb your love ? " Johnny asked , moving toward the door . Jim Hayes got up . " No , " he said . " Do n't even tell her you saw me. "  | Outside , Sam Cragg shivered . " Imagine a guy like that ! " " What he needs more than anything else , " said Johnny , " is a swift kick in the pants ! " " I could give it to him , big as he is , " Sam suggested . " No , your foot 's too big . He needs a smaller one ? Patsy Erb 's , for instance . Although I guess even that 's too late . " " I guess it is . What now , Johnny ? " " Back to Cedar City . It 's four o'clock and if the jalopy holds up we 'll make it by midnight . " " What 'd we accomplish here ? " " Plenty , Sam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it means . Or do I ? I almost forget that telephone call Orpington made to Wallace Erb from our room . " " That 's right ! " cried Sam . " That proves he did know Erb . " " Hayes verified that . But that 's all he did do . Orpington knew who Wallace Erb was . But why 'd he call him at Cedar City ? Just to say hello , your nephew swiped some nickels from my telephone twenty years ago ? " " Why do n't you ask Erb ? " " I would , if I thought he 'd give me the right answers . Think I 'll give him a shot , anyway . Patricia , too . And all the rest of them . "  | They were rolling through River Forest , on the far west side of Chicago , before Johnny said : " You know , Sam , I know more about Chester Erb right now than the police discovered twenty years ago . " " But you do n't know where he is ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunch  --  that I 'll find out . "  | Chapter Sixteen It was after midnight when they walked once more into the Carter-Lambert Hotel and went directly to their rooms . They had driven a distance of five hundred and sixty miles inside of thirty hours and in between had spent several hours tracing Archie Fitzgerald and Jim Hayes . The innumerable hot dogs and vile coffee that he had consumed at the frequent stops they had made at roadstands on the trip back from Chicago were not conducive to dreamless sleep . Johnny Fletcher dreamed that he was trying to sleep in a lighthouse and the surf pounding on the rocks was driving him mad . Then he dreamed that he was bowling and every time he rolled the big ball down the alley he made a strike , but some invisible devil immediately set up the pins before he could mark the score . Then he woke up and it was only some one pounding on the door of his room . Johnny groaned . " Go away ! " " Open up , Fletcher ! " called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lieutenant Cantrell of the police department . " Sam Cragg jerked up to a sitting position . " Cops before breakfast , " he said , bitterly . Johnny got up and let Lieutenant Cantrell into the room . " Do n't you fellows sleep in this town ? " he demanded . " Not when there are murderers running around , " Cantrell retorted . " And when suspects who 're supposed to stick around do a disappearing act . Where were you all day yesterday ? " " Oh , here and there . Why ? " " Because you know damned well you were n't supposed to leave town , that 's why . " " You did n't tell us not to , " retorted Johnny . " Anyway , since you arrested your murderer , I did n't think it was necessary any longer to stick around . I suppose you 've got a case all built up against Miss Thompson ? " Cantrell glowered . " I turned her loose . " Johnny made deprecating sounds with his mouth . " Tsk , tsk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people ? " Cantrell bared his teeth . " You have n't heard ? " Something in the detective 's tone finally caught Johnny 's interest . " What ? " Cantrell heaved a tremendous sigh . " We only had one homicide all year and that was a little lady  | who got mad at her husband eating peanuts in bed . Then this Cattle Congress comes along and we get two , count ' em , two , murders inside of three days . " " Ah ! Who was it this time ? Any one I know ? " " What makes you think that ? " Johnny shrugged . " You did n't come here just to see the rings under my eyes . " " I 've seen better rings . Well , this was a fella named Chester . Know him ? " Johnny started to wince and turned the wince into a grimace . " Chester ? Yes , Chester Gump . He 's Andy Gump 's son , you know ... " " Murder is n't funny , " Cantrell said , sourly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was shot in the alley , a block from this hotel . The bullet matches the one that was in Alfred Orpington . " " So ? . . . It could n't have been Miss Thompson . At least , not for this Chester . Who 's your choice now ? " Cantrell said pointedly : " Where were you yesterday ? An alibi 's in order . " " I was in Chicago . " " You can prove that ? " " I think so . A number of people there will remember me . " Lieutenant Cantrell took a notebook and pencil from his pocket . " Who , for example ? "  | Johnny Fletcher gave him the names of Professor Ehrlich of the Larchwood High School and Archie Fitzgerald , the stockbroker . While Cantrell was writing them down in his book , Sam Cragg got the newspaper that had been stuck under their door by the hotel management and opened its pages . He roared . " Wow ! Johnny  --  Miss Lizzie came in ! " " Miss Lizzie ? " Johnny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The oat burner we put five yards on . And listen  --  she paid $13.20 to win . Boy , oh boy , oh boy ! " Johnny gasped . Then he turned to the lieutenant . " And here 's a late afternoon alibi ! Joe Green , a bookmaker on Halsted and North Avenue . We put five hundred dollars on a horse that just paid $13.20 to win ! . . . " Cantrell 's face turned green . " You  --  you bet $500.00 on a horse and she paid $13.20 to win . Oh Lord ! . . . " He groaned . " Why do n't these things happen to me ? " " Maybe you do n't live right , Cantrell . " Cantrell looked as if he were going to burst into tears . " And the other night you won five grand in a crap game ! " " How do you know that ? " " Every one in the hotel knows it . This is n't New  | York . You ca n't keep a thing like that quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinks , the elevator boys . . . . " " All your stooges , eh , Cantrell ? " " That 's how I found out about this Chester fellow . He was in that game with you . And he was mixed up in that check business . What was that all about ? " " I walked out on that . Get the dope from Coons . " " I intend to . I want to get your story first . Who was at the game besides you and this Coons ? " " Did n't your stool pigeon give you a list ? " Cantrell nodded . " He said Wallace Erb was there . And his wife , too . And some other people . I want to know who the others were . " " I did n't know them all . There was a man with Chester . " " Martin Hatch . I 've got his name . The Thompsons , too . What about the others ? " " Those are all I knew . There were two or three others , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure Coons had them in the game , so it would n't look like a squeeze-out . " " August Grossman , the waiter , seemed to have that idea . But he said you came in with Erb and Chester . " " I met them and Hatch in front of the elevator  | downstairs . Erb introduced me to them . I 'd met Erb in the afternoon . I know nothing about him . " " I know all about him . " " You do ? He 's Mr. Big around here , is n't he ? " " Only one of the two richest men in Cedar City . That 's why I ca n't brace him . He might get sore and buy himself a new police department . . . . So Erb brought Hatch and Chester into the game ? " " And Erb was still there when I left it . By the way , Mrs. Erb went out with me . We went downstairs and had a drink until her husband came along . " Lieutenant Cantrell looked very unhappy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll bet a dime . And I do n't like it , at all . " " What part do n't you like ? " " I do n't like the part about Wallace Erb being tied in it up to his ankles . " " You can always write suicide on the blotter . " " Uh-uh . If Erb 's in it , I 'll get him  --  but I 've got to step around easy-like . " He scowled at his big knuckled hands . " You know , Fletcher , if you were n't such a wisecracker , you could be a help to me . You got a sharp brain . " " Why , thank you , Lieutenant ! " Johnny said mockingly . " That 's real praise coming from you . You figure my toes are clean , then ? " " If they 're not , you 're dumber than you look .  | With all that money you would n't have stuck around until this morning . Unless ... " " Unless what ? " " Unless you figured there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There might be . " " Is there ? " Johnny shook his head . " No . I 'm satisfied with the money I 've got . " Cantrell scowled . " That Thompson girl still worries we . Her prints match with a set that were on Orpington 's fox bag . How do you account for that ? She 's the one who reported the shooting in this room , you know . " " Have you asked her about her fingerprints ? " " Not yet . " " Well , I 'll tell you what I think . When we picked up Orpington , there was a lady in the place who was having a drink all by herself . Sam here , started fooling around with the fox in the bag , thinking it was a dog , and the lady came over and joined in . That was Miss Thompson . " Cantrell screwed up his face . " That 's a pretty strong coincidence . Lady in a bar up the street , touches the bag , then turns out to be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hers and it turns out the shot is killing the guy who owned the bag . I do n't like coincidences like that . "  | " Coincidences happen every day , Lieutenant , " Johnny said . " A cow 's eating grass in a field and suddenly gets it into her head to wander over onto the railroad tracks . A train comes along and makes hamburger of the cow . That 's a coincidence ; the cow just happening to get onto the tracks when the train came along . " " I 'm hungry , " Sam Cragg suddenly cut in . " So am I , " Johnny Fletcher said . Lieutenant Cantrell took the hint and moved toward the door . But he stopped with his hand on the doorknob . " You do n't know anything more , Fletcher ? " Johnny shook his head . " No , but I 'll keep my eyes and ears open . By the way , Lieutenant , how long has Wallace Erb lived in Cedar City ? " " Twelve-fifteen years . Oh  --  I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chicago . That was years before he ever moved here . " " Yeah , I know . I was rather interested when I discovered this was the same Erb . The newspapers and true detective magazines still run something about that old case , every now and then . " " Yeah . Fella came here two-three years ago , wanted me to give him some dope for a story for a magazine called True Murder Confessions . Said my name would be used with the story . I got the publicity and he got the money . If he 'd give me the  | money and taken the publicity himself , I 'd been more interested . " " So would I , Lieutenant . " Cantrell nodded . " Going out to the fairgrounds ? " " Yes . " " I 'll see you around , then . " The moment Cantrell had left the room , Johnny Fletcher sprang for his clothes . " Hurry up , Sam , things have popped . We 've got to find out what made them go off . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy about it . " Some one is playing for keeps and I 've got a hunch we ought to dust out of here . With that dough we won on Miss Lizzie ? " " We 're heeled ! " snapped Johnny . " But do you think I 'm going to live the rest of my life wondering who bopped off Alfred Orpington and Chester ? " " Let the cops find that out . Cantrell ? " " ? is a dope . He 's sniffing around the wrong telephone pole . " Johnny did not even stop for breakfast and he was so eager to get inside the fairgrounds that he paid the admission this morning . Then , when he got into the poultry building he discovered that he was so early the employees were just feeding the stock . Ben Longstreet , however , was around , fussing over his foxes . He looked sourly at Johnny Fletcher . " You ! " he said , " What 're you doing here ? "  | " Looking over the foxes . I 'm interested in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You do n't know a fox from a squirrel . You 're nothing but a book agent . I 've heard all about you . " " Oh , I 'm exposed , am I ? " Johnny chuckled . " Does your friend , Judge Orrin , know too ? " " He 's too dumb . Anyway , I would n't tell him the time of day . Putting down my foxes and giving all the blues and reds to Erb and Thompson . . . . " " Tough , " Johnny consoled Longstreet . " Miss Thompson was in a bit of a difficulty yesterday . " Longstreet sniffed . " A girl carrying around a revolver , you ca n't tell me she did n't figure on using it . " " Oh , you think she might have made bang-bang at Orpington ? I thought the ballistics man said the bullet was n't fired from Miss Thompson 's gun ? " " Pap ! How can they tell which gun fired a bullet ? It 's a lot of bunk , if you ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you say , . Longstreet , " . Johnny said , curtly . " But you know , fella , you 're a pretty sour-pussed old ginzo . I would n't put it past you to knock off Orpington yourself .... " Longstreet 's wizened face turned a violet purple and he choked as if a fishbone had become lodged in his throat . " Why , you , you cheap book agent ! . . . " he sputtered.  | Johnny grinned and placing his palm against the little man 's chest gave him a playful shove that slammed Longstreet back against the fox cages . Then he walked off , Sam Cragg following . The latter growled : " He ai n't big enough to hit . " " Well , go and see if you can pick a fight with Lord Mike , " Johnny retorted . " He 's your size . " " Yeah , but he wo n't fight . " " Well , go and argue with him anyway . Here comes Wallace Erb and I 'd like a few words with him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approaching , swinging a thick cane . " His wife ai n't with him , " Sam remarked . " Too bad . Hello , Mr. Erb . " Erb nodded coolly and would have passed Johnny had not the latter carelessly stepped into his way , blocking his passage in the narrow aisle . " Too bad about Earl Chester , is n't it ? " With his cane poised to brush Johnny aside , Wallace Erb paused . His gray-steel eyes looked coldly at Johnny . " Fletcher , " he said , " do n't do it . Do n't try anything with me . " " Why , what would I be trying on you , Mr. Erb ? " Johnny asked in an injured tone . " I merely made a comment . I was away yesterday and only  | heard about it today . Since Mr. Chester was a friend of yours , I naturally ? " " He was n't , " Erb cut in , " a friend . " " But you brought him to  --  well , to that crap game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strange little shiver of apprehension seemed to seep through Johnny . Erb said : " Are you a policeman , or are n't you ? " " No , of course not . It 's just ? " " Then , good morning , sir ! " Erb snapped and brushed past Johnny . Johnny turned slowly to watch Erb proceed down the aisle . He noted that Erb stopped before one of his fox cages on which was attached a blue ribbon . Johnny muttered under his breath . " I 'd like to stick a pin in him . " He walked through the poultry section of the show and came upon Lord Mike laying out his poultry magazines . Sam was nowhere in sight , however . " Hello , Mike , " Johnny greeted the English sheetwriter . Lord Mike was slightly embarrassed . " Ha . . good morning , old man . How are you today ? " " Just ripping , chappie ! " Johnny mocked . " Find any new suckers lately , wot ? " Lord Mike reddened . " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No need for you to put on like that . After all . . . a chap 's got to eat . " " Why ? " Lord Mike sighed . " I do n't suppose you 'd believe me if I told you Coons and I have split ? We never really were partners , you know . It was just that Bobby had the  --  ah , sucker as you put it and needed a front man . It seemed like easy money and no one hurt . " " I won , " said Johnny naively , " over six thousand dollars on a horse yesterday . " Lord Mike 's handsome mouth fell open . " You won six thousand on  --  on a horse ? " His lips still moved after he had stopped talking and Johnny thought there was perspiration on his face . Johnny chuckled . " I live right . I never rob a man , unless he 's the type that should be robbed . And then I never use a blackjack . " Lord Mike 's big hands were crumpling up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He went to a cafe near the poultry building and found Sam Cragg with a soiled plate before him , ordering another portion of ham and eggs . " Maybe you can live on gab , " Sam said , defensively . " Me , I need ham and eggs . Plenty of them . " " I think I 'll punish a few myself . Waitress , bring me the same . "  | Chapter Seventeen When they returned to the fox exhibit a considerable influx of visitors had arrived . There was a regular conference going on , in which Judge Orrin was waving his judging stick and orating to an assemblage . A fox cape was draped over feminine shoulders near the outskirts of the gathering , but Johnny could not see the wearer 's features . He waited in an adjoining aisle until the cape moved and he could recognize Jessie Thompson . He coughed loudly a couple of times , but she was too intent on whatever fox discussion was under way to hear him . He finally picked up a piece of tanbark and threw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bark struck Hal Thompson beside Jessie . Thompson turned and caught Johnny 's eye . He scowled . Johnny smiled invitingly , but Thompson tossed his head and turned back to the argument . His attitude , however , must have impressed itself upon his sister , for she turned her head and looked idly about . She saw Johnny and instantly moved away from the crowd .  | Johnny met her at the end of the aisle . " How 'd you like it ? " he asked . " The  --  jail ? I 'm sorry , they did n't really keep me in a regular cell . They merely asked me eighteen thousand questions and I told them nineteen thousand lies . And where have you been ? " " Chicago . I did n't get back until midnight . Lieutenant Cantrell gave me a before-breakfast call however and broke the news to me , about Chester 's death . . . . " Jessie shuddered lightly . " I 've been thinking . About this entire mix-up . I do n't believe it has anything to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has something to do with  --  with the Chester Erb case . That name , Chester . . . . " " Let 's get a cup of coffee and talk about it , Miss Thompson , " Johnny suggested . " I 'd like to tell you about some things I learned in Chicago yesterday . " They went to the cafe where Johnny had eaten breakfast only a few minutes before . Sam Cragg tagged along hopefully but as he entered the eating place , Johnny motioned for Sam to go somewhere else . They ordered coffee , then Jessie placed her elbows on the table and clasped her hands . " Now , tell me about Chicago . " " Since you 're an authority  --  well , somewhat of an authority  --  on the Chester Erb case , you 'll undoubt-  | edly recognize the names of Archie Fitzgerald and Jim Hayes . " " Chester Erb 's friends , of course . But ? " she frowned . " What made you say I 'm an authority on the  --  the case ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , but that was simply because of Mr. Erb . He was on my mind . " " Well , he 's been on my mind , too . Since .. . since I met Wallace . I got so curious about the thing , I thought I 'd run back and see if there was something some one had missed . I mean , years ago when the thing was hot . Often , you can get a better perspective on people and  --  things  --  when you look at them from a more mature viewpoint . I traced down both Fitzgerald and Hayes ! ... " Interest quickened in Jessie Thompson 's eyes . " You did ! And what did you learn ? " Johnny 's mouth twisted wryly . " That mottoes and maxims you learn in school  --  are just mottoes and maxims . That Jim Hayes , who was the most likely to succeed of all his classmates has just been kicked off the W.P.A. and is now on relief . " Jessie Thompson was shocked . " What a pity . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposite , of course . Rich . " Johnny shook his head . " Is there a law of nature or something that keeps smart chaps like Hayes and myself  | from getting anywhere ? You know . . . when I saw Hayes there in his cheap , furnished room I almost saw myself . " He laughed shortly . " It 's all right , I know I 'm smart . People have marveled at me all my life . Why does n't a man with your ability do something worth-while ? ' I 've heard that a hundred times , so I 'll spare you from saying it .... " " I was n't going to . " " But you were thinking it . Anyway , I learned the secret of Jim Hayes ' downfall  --  which has nothing to do with my own . Get ready for a shock . It was  --  Patsy Erb ! " Jessie was caught completely unawares . Her eyes flew open and her finely carved lips were lax . " Patsy Erb ! . . . " she repeated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first fur coat . ' He knew her in school and never quite got over her . " Jessie 's face was ashen under her make-up . " She ... she has that effect on men . Hal has never been quite the same since he met her . " Johnny said : " Jim Hayes was just a kid out of school . He bought that fur coat for Patsy on the installment plan . Probably walked to work so he could save money for the payments . " He laughed . " I guess Patsy 's always been partial to fur coats . She married a thousand of them  --  live silver-fox coats . " Jessie said tightly : " If she does n't let Hal alone I think  --  I think I 'll kill her . "  | " Whoa ! " said Johnny . " Do n't get to thinking like that . Not out loud anyway . Lieutenant Cantrell might hear you . Which brings me back to a point . Your fingerprints on that .3 2 . " Jessie tossed her head impatiently . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was I who killed the fox in your room . " " Yes , " said Johnny . " I 'd guessed that . Tell me about it . You went in to  --  well , why did you go into our room ? " " To warn Orpington . You see . . . " Jessie 's sharp white teeth bit her lower lip . Then she sighed . " I may as well tell you the truth . You know that I knew Orpington . His coming into that cocktail lounge was an accident . But the rest of it was n't . I came over deliberately to look at that bag , because I knew it contained a fox . I 'd hoped to see the address label , because it was apparent that he 'd just picked up the animal from the express company . I  --  I wanted to intimidate him . " " So he would n't exhibit the fox ? Oh ? ... " " So he would n't tell Wallace Erb about my brother and Patsy . I knew he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was astonished when he went into the room adjoining my own and I went inside and heard him make a telephone call . I had my ear against the wall , but , unfortunately , I could n't  | hear anything more than a rumble of words . And then . . . then I heard the shot ! " " Was he still on the telephone then ? " " I do n't know . . . . Yes , he was . The shot was fired as he was talking . " Johnny said : " Damn ! That gives him an alibi . " " Who ? I do n't understand . . . . " " He called Wallace Erb . I found that out a couple of days ago . By accident . The operator put a charge slip in my box . It gave the number Orpington called . It was Wallace Erb 's . And he was shot while talking to Erb ! " " Oh , but you do n't know that . I did n't actually hear anything . It  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom he was talking . " Johnny frowned . " It could at that . Still .. . if Erb knew that you were listening , he could come forward and say , yes , it was he to whom Erb was talking . And he 'd have an alibi . . . . At the expense of his wife . " " But Patsy  --  well , where was she at the time ? " Johnny nodded . " I see . You 're afraid she was with your brother that evening . He could provide her with an alibi , but it would come out then . " He did not add that perhaps neither Patsy or Hal Thompson had an alibi . He went on : " Let 's just carry through a little  | further . After the shot was fired  --  the first one ? what did you do ? " " Nothing ! I was frightened . You see ... well , I was afraid ... " " That Hal might be next door ? " " Something like that . I did nothing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until you and your friend entered the room . I heard some of your talk , because you were rather excited and spoke loud . . . . " " We practically yelled . Especially when the fox popped out from under the bed . We 'd been expecting a dog  --  a small one . We beat it out of the room and then you ? " " I could n't stand it any longer . After I heard your door slam I opened my own  --  just a crack  --  and saw you go into the room across the hall . I went to your room and  --  saw Orpington in the bathroom . " " And the fox ? " Jessie shuddered . " He was smelling at the blood . I shot him I  --  I do n't really know why . " " No ? Was it perhaps to confuse the issue ? Make some one think Orpington had been murdered by a rival fox breeder . . . " Jessie Thompson flushed . " I  --  I was rattled . I guess there was something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But that would n't have thrown suspicion away  | from your brother . Or yourself . Because you were rival exhibitors . " " I know , but it seemed to me at the moment it was better to have such a motive than  --  than the other one . I did n't have time to think . " " No , of course not . But Jessie  --  just one thing more . How did you happen to have the gun with you ? " She stared at him . He saw the slight flare of her nostrils and looked down at his coffee cup . Then she answered his question . " It was Hal 's gun . Before we left home I took it . Just in case . . . just in case Hal  --  oh , all right , to prevent Hal from taking it . I knew about Patsy , you see and I was afraid that Hal ... " " That Hal might decide the best way to get Patsy was to bump off her husband ? " His blunt question brought the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know everything ? what ? " " What what ? " " Are you going to tell that policeman  --  Lieutenant Cantrell ? " " I say more to Cantrell than any one else , " Johnny said , " but I do n't tell him anything . If you get my meaning . I give him a lot of words which do n't mean anything . " " I know that , " Jessie said , somewhat resentfully .  | " I just realize it now . You brought me out here to tell me what you learned in Chicago and the first thing I know I 've done all the talking  --  told you everything  --  and you 've told me nothing . " " Oh , " said Johnny , contrite , " do n't get that impression . I had n't intended to pump you . No , that 's not true . I had . I wanted to tie up some loose ends in my mind . But look , Jessie , I want to go on record right now . I do n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But what did you tell Cantrell ? " " I simply denied everything . After Chester  --  I mean after he got the news about Chester 's death , he built up a theory of his own . That I 'd heard the shot next door , went to investigate , became frightened by the fox and shot it . I did n't deny that theory . " " It 's a good one . Stick to it , Jessie . Now , let me tell you about Jim Hayes . . . and Chester Erb and Archie Fitzgerald . It 's Fitzgerald 's theory that Chester was killed by  --  by a relative who stood to inherit . There was only one relative , you 'll recall ? Wallace Erb . Hayes on the other hand , thinks that Chester merely ran away from home . Take your choice . So you see , the two men who knew Chester Erb  --  as boys  --  better than any one else , have exactly opposite theories . As have a million other people . " " But your theory , Johnny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Which one would you be inclined to believe ? " " Well , " Johnny said , grinning , " W.P.A. or no , I liked Jim Hayes better . . . . In fact ? " He broke off and a look of astonishment came to his face . Jessie saw it and exclaimed . " What is it ? " " I just thought of something . Yes . . . it might turn out rather surprisingly . Jim Hayes ! Look , Jessie , all this guesswork about the man with the name of Chester . Earl Chester . You think he might be Chester Erb ? " She nodded . " I 've been thinking about it . " " So have I. And I 'll bet so has Lieutenant Cantrell only he 's afraid to say so because of Mr. Big ? Wally Erb , who knows . " " That it 's Chester Erb ? " " No . Wallace knows if it is or is n't . At least he should know . Unless Chester changed a great deal in the last twenty years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've snapshots of myself at the age of fourteen and  --  well , that is n't twenty years ago . Still I do n't think any one else would recognize me today from my snaps taken at the age of fourteen . " " Your brother would . It 's a chance . If Wallace Erb could recognize his nephew after twenty years , so could  --  Jim Hayes ! " " And Archie Fitzgerald . Of course ! .. . "  | " So , " said Johnny , " the thought struck me that Lieutenant Cantrell could get one or the other ? preferably Jim Hayes  --  here to look at the dead man ! " Jessie 's eyes widened . " Jim Hayes ! And .. . he 's an old sweetheart of Patsy 's . . . . Oh , but you could n't do that ! " " Have him meet Patsy again ? Why could n't I do it ? " " Because you said  --  he never got over Patsy . It would  --  it would be just like opening an old wound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughtfully . " And Patsy 's married again . By the way , at the risk of being feline , I 'd like to say that this is Patsy 's second trip to the plate . The first was a strikeout . ... Yeah , I guess I could n't do a thing like that . Be tough on Jim . It had better be Archie . " " You 're not going to suggest it to Lieutenant Cantrell ? He . . . might ask both Hayes and Fitzgerald . " " Damn ! " said Johnny . " Why does Cantrell have to be so dense ? He could think of this himself and save us some worry . He would n't have to be so delicate about the thing . " " Promise ! " said Jessie . " Promise you wo n't suggest it to Lieutenant Cantrell . From what you told me about Jim Hayes , I 've formed a rather tragic picture of him . Promise you wo n't have him dragged up here and made to go through seeing Patsy again . "  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " So Johnny promised and after watching Jessie go back toward the fox exhibits , he scurried for a popcorn stand where he got five dollars worth of small change . With the handful of money he went to a telephone booth . As he dialed for the operator , he said to himself : " I promised not to suggest it to Lieutenant Cantrell . I did n't say I would n't call Jim myself . " The operator said : " Information ! " " I want to get long distance , " Johnny said . " Chicago . I do n't know what the number is but the phone 's listed under the name of Kemper and the address is 1788 Halsted Street . It 's a rooming house and the party I want to speak to is James Hayes . H as in Henry , A as in Archibald , Y as in Ypsilanti , E as in enunciate and S as in sap , which is me . .. . Yes , person to person . How much ? Two dollars and seventy-five cents ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fed quarters into the rapacious maw of the slot and heard them bonk down into the vitals . They sounded almost like chimes  --  church bells . He waited with the receiver , as the operator got Chicago and relayed the information . Then after a while he heard the whirring of the Chicago operator ringing Mrs. Kemper 's number . They cut him off then , but after a moment , he was connected again and the operator said : " Here 's your party , sir ! "  | Jim Hayes ' voice said , tensely : " Who is this calling ? " " John Fletcher , " Johnny said . " You know , the man who talked to you yesterday . I 'm calling from Cedar City , Iowa . Yes , I know . You thought it was some one else . Well , look , have you read this morning 's papers ? " " No , " said Jim Hayes . " It 's too far to walk to the public library . " " All right , " said Johnny . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have to draw pictures for you . You knew yesterday that I was interested in the Chester Erb case . A particular angle has been injected into that case . In fact , another man has been killed . Yesterday  --  while I was in Chicago , so do n't go getting ideas . Anyway the man 's name was Earl Chester . Earl Chester . No , Chester is the surname . But . . . this man knew Wallace Erb , had been to see him the day before . With a lawyer ! Does that suggest anything to you ? ... " " It suggests that you 're wasting a hell of a lot of money to call me long distance , " Jim Hayes retorted . " But go ahead , what 's your beef ? " " The thing is two murders have been committed so far this week . The first is what sent me to Chicago . All right , I 'll probably be sued for libel and slander . But I think Wallace Erb 's nose is sticking in this somewhere . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nephew . He would n't . But  --  you could , Jim . " " What for ? " " What for ? Why . . . " Johnny floundered an instant , " why , for curiosity 's sake , if nothing else . I do n't suppose you have any fond recollections of your boyhood pal . No , I guess not . Well , look , will you do me a favor ? " " No , " Jim Hayes said bluntly . " Why the hell should I ? I do n't know you from Adam Sitting Bull . " " All right , but you know Joe Green . Yes , your Joe Green , the fat greasy bird who runs a cigar store for a blind and has a poolroom in back and who knows Julius Schlager . He told me where I could find you . I bribed him with a five hundred bet on a horse . " " The lousy son of a bitch , " Jim Hayes said , bitterly . " He 'd sell his grandmother for that five hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . " " Oh so , " chuckled Johnny . " Then you 'll be glad to know that the oatburner on which I laid that five hundred came in  --  and paid $ 13.20 . No , do n't say If I fell into a manure pile I 'd come up with the crown jewels . ' I live right , that 's all . Well , look , I 'm in a jam here . I ca n't leave today  --  and I 'm afraid Joe Green'Il skip with my winnings . I 'd like for you  | to collect the money and bring it out to me . I 'll pay you ten per cent commission . . . . " Jim Hayes snickered . " You 'd send a rabbit to bring home a lettuce ? " " I would , " said Johnny , " if the rabbit was muzzled . And you are . That 's why you 've living on Halsted Street , right now . " There was a moment of silence , then Hayes said in a rather strained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the money . " " I think you can persuade him , " Johnny said . " Tell him I 'm a friend of the mayor 's and if he does n't believe you , have him telephone me here at the Carter-Lambert . Either myself or Sam Cragg , my pal , will be there to verify it . . . . After you get the money , hop the first train for Cedar City . Okay ? " " All right , " said Jim Hayes . Johnny hung up and almost instantly the telephone rang . Johnny scooped off the receiver . The operator 's voice said , sweetly : " That will be seventyfive cents additional . " " Is that so ? " Johnny snapped . " Charge it up to Roosevelt . I paid my income tax . " He banged the receiver back on the hook and walked out of the booth . He returned to the poultry building and found Sam Cragg , near Lord Mike 's booth , trying to put  | the evil eye on the Englishman . Johnny tapped him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want you to hustle back to the hotel and stick in our room . Presently you will receive a long distance call from our bookmaker friend , Joe Green of Chicago , asking if it will be all right to turn our money over to one Jim Hayes ? " " Hey ! . . . " Sam cried . Johnny chuckled . " You will tell him quite so , it is perfectly all right to give Mr. Hayes the money . . . . " " Are you crazy ? " Sam gasped . " No , " said Johnny . " Jim Hayes will bring the money to us . We ca n't leave here and I do n't trust Joe Green too long with that money ? " " I do n't trust Jim Hayes ! " howled Sam . " That 's more money'n he 's ever seen in his life . He 'll skip with it . . . . " " He wo n't . The man 's honest . I 'm sure of it . Better hurry up to the hotel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  | Chapter Eighteen Sam went off , muttering to himself . Johnny turned toward the fox end of the building and almost collided with Patricia Erb , wearing a three-quarterlength mink coat . Remembering their last encounter , Johnny expected her to pass him without even a sign of recognition . She fooled him , did Patsy Erb . She came straight up to him , took his arm and said : " Come and buy me a drink , Johnny . " " Two , " Johnny replied , " but no more . That 's my quota for one day . " They left the poultry building and Johnny would have turned toward the cafe , but Patricia Erb steered him instead to a brilliant yellow roadster . " We 'll go outside . I want to talk to you and I do n't want anybody stumbling in on us accidental , on purpose . " He helped her into the car , and got in beside her . She backed out of the parking space , then turned toward the main gates . As they rolled out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were you yesterday ? "  | " I took a little business trip . Things were kind of slow here . . . . " " Slow ? You do n't know what happened ? " " You mean this fellow Chester ? Yes , I 've heard . Since I got back . I scarcely knew the man , though . Did you ? . . . " She turned her head sharply to look into his face . " Why should I know him ? I saw him at  --  at that game , the other night . That 's all . " She turned to watch the traffic again and Johnny glanced covertly at her profile . It was a very nice profile . Her chin still did not show any signs of becoming full . Had he not been told her age by Jim Hayes he would have guessed her to be twentyeight at the most . Her hair was brushed shiny and she wore a perfume that had undoubtedly been blended especially for her sparkling personality . Johnny saw that they were heading out of Cedar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we head-ing ? " " A little spot out here that I like . It 's just about a half mile or so . " The little spot was a roadhouse that had room for a hundred cars in its parking lot . At this time of the day , however , there was only a sleek sedan near the front door and a truck , from which a couple of men were unloading beer barrels .  | Patricia parked the yellow roadster next to the sedan . " I hardly think they 'll be open for business this early , " Johnny said . " They 'll be open  --  for me . The proprietor 's a friend of mine . " She entered the roadhouse and Johnny followed . There were booths along three sides and tables in the center of a large floor . The chairs were turned upside down on the tables and a couple of men were waxing the floor with a huge floor polishing machine . A man in a very natty suit of tweeds was counting money behind the bar . His face broke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Pat  --  Mrs. Erb ! " he exclaimed . " Hello , Nick , " Patricia Erb said , easily . " This is Johnny Fletcher , a friend of mine . Johnny , Nick Petrakis ? " " Who used to run a speak on 46th Street , " Johnny said . " Hi , Nick ! " Nick stuck out a hand on which there was a diamond set in black onyx . " Johnny Fletcher ! What 're you doing ' way out here in Ioway . Geez , I ai n't seen you in six-seven years . . . " Since you left New York suddenly . I often wondered what became of you . " Nick Petrakis frowned . " I bought beer from the wrong fellas . Friend a mine did the same thing and  | they said he put his feet into a barrel of cement and went deep-sea diving . I did n't like fish , so what the hell , I came out here .... " " And you 're doing very nicely , too . I always thought I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so I decided to give it a whirl myself this year . " " We 'll have a fireside chat later , boys , " Patsy Erb cut in . " Nick , I want to talk to Johnny . Mind sending your boys into the kitchen for a while ? " " Sure thing , Pat . Hey , boys  --  go down in the basement and cut the rye . You like a drink , Pat ? something that ai n't been cut ? " " A champagne cocktail , Nick . How about you , Johnny ? " " I 'll try the bubbles , too . " " Coming up , " said Nick , " where do you want them ? " " In the booth over in the corner . " Johnny and Patricia had scarcely seated themselves than Nick brought the drinks . As he was turning away , Patricia said : " Nick , was I here Monday evening ? " Nick looked at Johnny . " Sure . No . I 'll swear to it . Either way . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but you meant well . " Nick went off .  | " So you have an alibi if you need it ? " Johnny said . Patsy Erb nodded . " This business has gotten beyond the kidding stage , Johnny . The cops have begun sniffing around our house . They never did that before . " " Umm , " said Johnny . " And your husband is Mr. Big in this man 's town . " " And they know it . That 's why I wanted to talk to you , Johnny . You 've been doing a lot of sniffing around yourself . What 's your interest in all this ? " " If you mean , am I a cop ? No . In Popeye 's own words , I yam what I yam , ' and that 's a book salesman . A man was killed in my room . I 'm still Suspect Number One . " Patricia Erb sipped at her champagne cocktail and looked at Johnny across the top of her glass . " Do you think I killed him ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , if the man was jeopardizing your five thousand silver foxes . " Her eyes clouded . " You 're always brutally frank , are n't you , Johnny Fletcher ? The hell of it is , I think I would kill a man  --  or a woman  --  if either one seriously endangered me . " " I said your foxes , ' Johnny reminded her . That stung her . He thought for a moment that  | her fingers would snap the stem of the champagne glass . But then she relaxed and laughed . " You think I 'm a gold digger . " " I was in Chicago yesterday , " Johnny said . " I talked to a fellow named . . . Jim Hayes . " Her make-up stood out suddenly on her face like a mask . Her hand tried to pick up the cocktail and spilled some of it on the table . " Jim , " she said , in a voice that quivered . " You ... saw Jim Hayes ? " Johnny nodded . " How is he ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " He 's fine , " Johnny said . " He was just kicked off the W.P.A. " A gasp escaped her scarlet lips . " That 's a  --  you 're a fiend , Johnny Fletcher . " " I 'm telling you the truth , Patsy Springer . Jim Hayes is living in a cheap , furnished room on Halsted Street . He 's never gotten anywhere , because he 's never forgotten you . That 's really a compliment , Patsy . " She shook her head slowly . " Poor Jim . It would n't have worked out . I 'd have broken his heart ? " " You did . " Her eyes became hard , suddenly , but that was  | because there was moisture in them . " Damn you , Johnny Fletcher ! " " Back at you , " Johnny smiled grimly . " I 'm as tough as you are , because a dame just like you did something to me a long time ago . " " Then you 're all the bigger fool , Johnny . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was n't good for you . " " She had hair like yours , Patsy . Your eyes remind me of hers . I could see the dollar marks in the pupils . " " Cut it out , " Patsy Erb said , fiercely . " You ca n't make me bawl . Twelve years is a long time . He was a fool . " " Sure . He was a fool . Did you know he was the Jim Hayes who went to school with Chester Erb ? " She stared at Johnny . " When I knew Jim , I 'd never even heard of Chester Erb . What are you getting at ? " " If you did n't know  --  nothing . That 's how I happened to see Jim , though . I was running down some angles about Chester Erb . " " So that explains your interest in all this . You ... you think what 's happened this week has something to do with Chester Erb ? " " You thought so . Is n't that why you brought me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes together . " I do n't know  | what to think any more . Wallace is  --  has never been a very communicative person . And I 've been worried . " " Earl Chester and that lawyer , Hatch , were out at the house the other night and talked with Wally for a long time . Then the next day , Chester was killed . " " Look , Patsy , forget your alibi for a moment . Were you at home Monday night at eleven o'clock ? " " You 're still harping at that . I did n't kill Orpington , although I think he got what he deserved . " " You were with  --  Hal Thompson ? " " He told you ? Or his sister ? " " No . Neither one did . I just wanted to know if Orpington had talked to you on the telephone Monday night . You see , he telephoned your house at eleven o'clock . He was killed while telephoning . " Her mascaraed lids narrowed as she pondered that . It was a long moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if Wally was talking to him  --  he could n't have killed Orpington ! " " If he was talking to Orpington on the phone . I do n't know that . The police do n't even know that Orpington telephoned your number . " " But you know . Then it 's all right . You see  --  I was n't home Monday evening . " " Then , providing your husband talked to Orping-  | ton on the phone  --  and not a servant  --  he has an ironclad alibi . But you have n't , Patsy .... " " I do n't need one , " she exclaimed . " I know ! I did n't kill him and Wally did n't . That 's all I wanted to know  --  for sure ! " " But how about Hal Thompson ? Will your alibi include him ? " A cloud came over her face . " Damn ! Am I supposed to be noble , now ? Just because I smiled at a chump ? " " Ah ! " said Johnny . She glared furiously at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your face ? " " I 'd smack you right back . I do n't believe in dames taking advantage of their sex and smacking men . " " That 's what I thought . " She smiled admiringly . " That 's what I like about you . " " Oh , you like me ? " " Remind me to tell you about it sometime . Well , are you ready to go ? " " Hey , wait a minute . There 're still some questions I want to ask you . " " I do n't want to hear them . I 've heard enough . " He got up . " As long as your silver foxes are safe , the hell with the rest of it , eh ? " She laughed at his bitterness . " The hell with  | you , too , Johnny old boy . . . . Hey , Nick ! We 're leaving . " Nick Petrakis popped out of a door . " Fine , Pat . Come around on Saturday . Bring Mr. Wallace along . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come , too , Mr. Fletcher . And bring your friends . " " If any , " Johnny retorted .  | Chapter Nineteen Lieutenant Cantrell was leaning against the door of the poultry building when Patricia Erb parked her yellow roadster near by . He said , bitterly to Johnny : " You get around , fella . " " I just bought a chance on a stuffed moose , Lieutenant . Thanks for the lift , Mrs. Erb . " " You 're welcome , " said Patsy and went past Lieutenant Cantrell into the building . " Mrs. Erb , " said Cantrell , " who do you think you 're kidding  --  her husband ? " " Tsk , tsk , Lieutenant ; we must n't forget we 're gentlemen . Gentlemen do n't discuss ladies . " " Nuts . What 's this about you and Jim Hayes ? " " Hayes ? " Johnny repeated . " I have n't been buying any hay . Gasoline maybe , but no hay . " " The hell with that crap ! " snarled Cantrell . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chicago a half hour ago . " Johnny looked at the lieutenant with a jaundiced eye . " Out here in the Bible belt , you tap telephone wires ? " " I was a cop in Kansas City before I came to this  | burg , " Cantrell retorted . " If I did n't have to depend on local lunkheads for shadowing , you 'd never have got to Chicago yesterday , without my knowing it . So spill it , Fletcher . Before I get sore and take you down to headquarters again and really show you that rubber hose . " " Jim Hayes is a bookie . . . " Johnny began . " Joe Green is the bookie , " Cantrell snapped . " My man got it down in shorthand . Hayes is bringing you some dough . Cut out the clowning ; you 've been playing detective all week . You know damn well there was a Jim Hayes in the Chester Erb business . You went to Chicago yesterday to look him up . Hell , I talked to Chicago on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to run him down . How the hell 'd you do it ? " " Because I 'm not a cop . I found Archie Fitzgerald , too . " " In Chicago ? " Lieutenant Cantrell 's tone showed grudging respect . " Why do you fool around selling books ? " " Why do you fool around being a cop ? Because I like what I 'm doing . You insist on counting me as a suspect in this affair and I 've got to solve it to prove I 'm innocent . " " You 've got it solved , Fletcher ? " " No , but I 'm going to . Maybe when Hayes gets here . "  | " If he 's taking a train , the Chicago cops will grab him . I teletyped . " " Going to steal my thunder , eh ? It 's okay with me . If he identifies Earl Chester as Chester Erb , it 's your case . " " You do n't think he will ? " Johnny shrugged . " You going to charge Wallace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to be his nephew , yes ! I 'll ram it down Erb 's throat , if I get kicked off the force for it . " " It 's twenty years , Hayes may not be able to identify Chester . " " Then I 'll get this Fitzgerald down here . " " You 'll find him lunching at the Midwest Athletic Club in Chicago  --  if he is n't at his office on LaSalle . He 's as rich as Wallace Erb . That 'll be two millionaires you can kick around . " " I 'm not afraid of millionaires . I 've got some money saved and if I get a break on this case , I 'm going to Chicago and open up a private detective agency of my own . Maybe I 'll even hire you , Fletcher  --  if you 're in the clear on this . " " I 'm clean as a fox 's tooth , Chief . Which reminds me  --  are all the fox boys inside ? Uh . . . Thompson and Longstreet . . . and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're having a powwow . About their fur auction . "  | " I did n't know they were having an auction . " " Oh , sure , they have it every year . The newsreel men take pictures of it . It 's tomorrow , at Erb 's place . " " Private ? " " Naw , they get a big crowd . Lots of fur buyers come here from New York and St. Louis . It ai n't only Erb 's furs , you know . All the breeders from adjoining states bring their . stuff . They sold twenty thousand pelts last year . " Johnny whistled . " That 's a lot of fur coats ! Maybe you can pick up a few skins for your missus , Lieutenant ? "  | Chapter Twenty The phone rang and Johnny strode across the room and scooped it up . " Fletcher ? " a voice asked . " This is Jim Hayes . What 's your room number ? " " Five fifteen , " groaned Johnny . " Come right up . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tapped wire would immediately report to Lieutenant Cantrell that Jim Hayes had arrived . A sudden thought struck him . " Sam , hold the fort . The cops 'll be here in a couple of minutes . I want to grab Jim Hayes and talk to him a few minutes first . I 'll run him into Jessie Thompson 's room . Stall Cantrell , a few minutes at least . " " All right , Johnny , " Sam said , reluctantly , " but remember it 's a crummy jail here in this burg . Bail me out before morning . " " Okay . " He darted to the door and stepped out into the hallway , just as the elevator door was opening . Jim Hayes stepped out . Johnny signaled to Hayes . " This way , Jim ! " He hurried to the door of Room 517 and rapped on  | it . Hal Thompson opened it . " Can I come in a minute ? " Johnny asked . Hal Thompson blocked the door truculently . " What 'd you want ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a friend of mine , Jim Hayes . Hal Thompson , Jim . " " H'arya , " said Jim Hayes . Johnny was crowding Hal Thompson into his room and the latter did not like it so well . " Say . . . " he began , " what 's the idea ? . . . " " The cops are after me , " Johnny said bluntly , " and I want to solve this case before they grab me . Jim . . . did you bring that stuff ? " Hayes took a thick manila envelope from his pocket . " It 's all there , six thousand and six hundred dollars . " " You did n't take your cut ? " Hayes grunted . " My time 's worth about two dollars a day . Call it five bucks for two days if you want . " Johnny inhaled softly . " What about your ex-penses ? " Hayes made a jerking motion with his thumb . " I hitchhiked . Guys on relief do n't ride in trains . " Johnny shook his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's something you mentioned the other day , Jim , that 's been sticking in my mind . You  | know , that business about you buying Patricia Erb her first fur coat ? " " God damn you , Fletcher ! " Hal Thompson burst out , " what the hell are you trying to pull ? " " Why , nothing , Hal , " Johnny said , innocently . " Jim here knew the present Mrs. Erb away back . They went to school together , did n't you , Jim ? " Hayes looked steadily at Johnny . " What 're you talking about ? " Johnny snickered . " She 's still got a hold on you , Jim ? What a woman ! " Hal Thompson started grimly toward Johnny and the latter retreated around the bed . " Hold it , Hal ! " he snapped . " Do n't act like a kid . I 'm going to tell you some things that 'll open your eyes and it 's damned high time . You 've already gotten your fingers burned . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm telling you the truth . Patricia Erb just has n't got it in her to remain loyal to any one man . She 's used men all her life to get ahead and if you think she 's going to let go of a million dollars just for a handsome young man with a dimple , you 're ? " " I think I 'll go , " said Jim Hayes , smiling crookedly . " You walk out of here and you walk into the arms of the cops , " said Johnny . " And hold it ? Thompson ! "  | " Go ahead , " said Thompson , grimly . " Say your piece and when you get finished I 'm going to pin your ears down . " " If you still want to when I get finished I wo n't even try to stop you . You , Jim , keep your mouth shut a while . All right , Thompson . Jim Hayes went to school with Patricia Springer who 's now Patsy Erb . She was flunked out the year he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bought her a fur coat  --  on the installment plan . She ran off with a fellow named Collins who took her to New York and bought her into a show . After she 'd gone through his money , she threw him over and played the field until Erb and his millions came along . She married him and has since played with every young fellow who 's even looked at her ! " " Go ahead , " said Thompson . " I will . The setup is this : Jim Hayes was Chester Erb 's boyhood friend . If you 'll remember the Erb case you 'll know that Jim Hayes and Archie Fitzgerald were the last known persons to see Chester Erb that day he disappeared . Do you begin to suspect anything ? Jim Hayes fell in love with the girl who later married Wallace Erb , who benefited by Chester Erb 's disappearance . " Hal Thompson stared at Jim Hayes . " Is he telling the truth ? " Hayes nodded . ' Yes , but Patsy had n't even heard  | of Chester @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been gone eight years , then ? " " Right , " said Johnny . " But when Patricia Springer did meet Wallace Erb in New York some years later , she knew all about Chester . She 'd heard of him from Jim , here . So she knew about Wallace Erb and played the game for what it was worth . . . . " Johnny screwed up his mouth thoughtfully . " Jim , what was the name of the druggist who turned Chester in for stealing nickels out of the telephone ? " " Orpington , " Jim Hayes replied . " But I do n't see ! ? " The name had registered on Hal Thompson . His eyes suddenly seemed to bulge from his forehead . " Orpington ! . . . " he repeated . " He knew Chester Erb ! . . . " " Yep , " said Johnny . " He did . Jim , you have n't been keeping up with your newspaper reading . Orpington was the name of a man who was killed here in Cedar City this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own room . The name 's an unusual one . Do you suppose it was the same Orpington who knew young Chester Erb twenty years ago ? And if it was , why was he killed now ? And who do you suppose did it ? Think about it a minute . " Jim Hayes thought . And so did Hal Thompson . Johnny watched them regarding one another , puzzled expressions on their faces .  | After a while Hal Thompson shook his head . " I do n't get the connection . " " Neither do I , " said Johnny . " But there is a connection . I 'm willing to bet this six thousand odd against a lead quarter that Orpington , the fox breeder , was killed because he knew Chester Erb twenty years ago . " " Make your point , Fletcher , " said Hayes . " Orpington hardly knew Chester . He just grabbed him swiping those nickels and called the cops . . . . " " That 's all , " said Johnny . " But in the days that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Through the newspapers . Because he knew the principal character of a case that became nationally known he probably retained a more than passing interest . Every time he 'd pick up a newspaper or magazine in later years his memory would go back over the whole thing . Suppose then  --  twenty years later , Orpington went to Cedar City , Iowa , and there saw Chester Erb . What would be his first reaction ? " " He 'd talk to him , I guess , " said Hayes . " Provided he was sure of his identification . " " Orpington would be sure . He knew Chester as a kid and seeing his pictures in the papers for twenty years he 'd know him under any circumstances . Would n't you  --  Jim ? " " I guess I would . Just point out the man you  | think is Chester and I 'll tell you if he is or not . I might have to talk to him a minute or so , but ? " " You ca n't talk to a dead man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how could Orpington ? ... " " We 've had another murder , since Orpington 's , " Johnny said . " A man who called himself Earl Chester . As a matter of fact , a police officer is undoubtedly in the next room right now ? No , he 's here ! " A fist banged on the door and almost immediately Cantrell 's voice cried out : " Open up , in there . " " It 's not locked ! " Johnny called . The door burst in and Lieutenant Cantrell , exceedingly red of face , pushed into the room . " Fletcher , " he began , " what 's the idea ? . . . " " This is Jim Hayes , " Johnny said , easily . " Jim , meet Lieutenant Cantrell of the Cedar City police department . " Cantrell strode up to Jim Hayes and looked him truculently in the eye . " So you 're the kid who went to school with Chester Erb , huh ? " " I 've grown a little , " Jim Hayes said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to step over to the county morgue with me and identify a body . " " Two , " said Johnny , quietly . " Jim knew Orpington , too . " Cantrell whirled . " What 's that ? "  | " Oh , did n't you know ? " Johnny asked innocently . " Orpington knew Chester Erb twenty years ago . In fact , he had him arrested one time  --  for stealing nickels . " Cantrell deflated like a punctured tire . " Fletcher , " he said , thickly , " what the hell . . . are you up to ? " " I 'm trying to help you solve this case . That 's all . " " You 've been holding out on me ! " " So have you . You 've shadowed me and tapped my wire . You hauled me down to your jail and for four days you 've tried your damndest to pin the thing on me . The only way I could convince you that you were sniffing at the wrong telephone pole , was to dig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Who is it ? " " I do n't know  --  yet ! But let me run along with you for a while . " Cantrell glowered . " All right , come . And Hayes ! ... " The three of them left the room . In the corridor a couple of policemen wandered around . Cantrell waved them toward the elevators . They walked to the morgue , which was behind the police station . In the dank , cold room , an attendant pulled out a slab . Jim Hayes , a bit white about the mouth , looked down at the object on the slab .  | " Yes , " he said , " that 's Orpington . " Cantrell 's nostrils flared . " And you did n't even know him very well . All right , then , look  --  at this ! " Jim Hayes glanced at the figure on the second slab . For an instant Johnny could hear the wheezing , breath of the morgue attendant . Then Hayes said , evenly : " No . It 's not Chester @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to be ! Look again ! " " Sorry , it is n't . Chester had a little scar on his chin that he got when Archie Fitzgerald hit him with a tin can when we were playing duck-on-the-rock . And his features are all wrong . . . . " " But that was twenty years ago , " persisted Cantrell . " He 's changed a lot ! " " So has Orpington , but I knew him . " " Orpington was n't a kid , then . He was fullgrown and would n't change as much as a kid would . " Hayes shook his head , doggedly . " It 's not Chester Erb . I knew Chester too well . " Cantrell turned tortured eyes on Johnny . " Where 's your case , now , Fletcher ? " " Goddamit , " Johnny said . They left the morgue and went to the police station . There Lieutenant Cantrell ordered the desk sergeant to have Hatch brought out . The lawyer friend of the dead Earl Chester was  | unshaven and wild-eyed when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this to me , " he snarled at Lieutenant Cantrell . " I 'll sue the police department of this hick town to ? " " Shut up ! " Cantrell snapped . " I 'm charging you with extortion and I 'm damn well going to make it stick . " " You ca n't ! " Hatch cried . " I 'm a member of the Illinois Bar Association and ? " " And you 'll be disbarred . Trying to ring in a phony heir . " " I 've got proof , " insisted Hatch . " Even though Chester Erb is now dead , I have proof that ? " " This , " cut in Cantrell , " is Jim Hayes . Remember his name ? ... " Hatch looked at Jim Hayes and his bluster seemed to seep out through his pores . " Jim Hayes , the boy who ? " he began , thickly . " Chester Erb 's best friend ! Now go on with your proof . He just looked at your Chester and says it is n't Chester Erb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment . Then he made a tremendous effort and forced a feeble smile . " To think that Chester hoodwinked me .... " " Oh , " said Johnny , " it 's going to be like that , eh ? " " Of course . I was merely acting as his attorney .  | In good faith . He came to me and told me he was the missing Chester Erb , showed me documents ? " " What documents ? " demanded Cantrell . " You 've been talking about them long enough . Produce them , now ! " " I have n't got them here . Naturally , I put them in a safe-deposit box in Chicago . Knowing what I did about Wallace Erb ? " " What do you know about him ? " Johnny asked , suddenly . Hatch cleared his throat . " Uh . . . only what Chester told me . I mean the man who called himself Chester . He said his uncle had forced him to run away from home . He had something on Chester . Not much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kid then ? " " Exactly what did your Chester claim his uncle had on him ? Robbing nickels from public telephones ? . . . " Hatch brightened . " Yes . And I investigated that angle myself . The police had a record of an arrest ? " " And that was your proof ? " Johnny asked , scornfully . " Partly . I  --  well , that was something only Chester Erb could have known , was n't it ? It never came out in the papers . . . . " " No , because Chester 's father squelched it . But  | any newspaperman could have taken a look at the police blotter for a couple of weeks preceding Chester 's disappearance and found out . Some of them probably did , but did n't think it good taste to blacken the kid 's character , since it was thought at the time that he was a victim of kidnapers . What other proof did your Chester show you ? . . . " " Snapshots of himself as a boy . I compared them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ originally re-photographed , " Johnny snorted . Hatch shifted his tactics suddenly to indignation . " I was employed merely as his attorney . I acted in good faith . " " In trying to shake down Wallace Erb ? " Cantrell snapped . " He was going to pay us , " retorted Hatch . " If that did n't indicate belief ? " Jim Hayes suddenly spoke up . " Lieutenant , can I take another look at the  --  the body ? Of the man named Chester . " Cantrell 's mouth fell open . " What ? " Johnny stepped around to look so he could peer into Jim Hayes ' eyes . There were tiny creases in the corners . Some vague doubt was stirring in Jim Hayes ' brain . No doubt of that . " Let him look , Cantrell , " he said . Muttering under his breath , Cantrell strode to the  | door . He jerked it open and yelled : " Milligan , lock up Hatch again . Come on , Hayes ! " The trio returned to the morgue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead features . He looked for a long time , then walked around the slab to take a squint from another angle . And at last , he nodded . " I did n't know him very well , but I think  --  yes , I 'm pretty sure it is . " " Who ? " cried Cantrell in consternation . " Erb ? What do you mean you did n't know him very well ? . . . " " Charlie Plennert . A boy in the class behind ours . This is Charlie Plennert . Since his name 's come to me , I 'm getting surer every minute . " Cantrell threw up his hands . " Holy Smoke ! And now we 've got another ? " " Wait a minute ! " cried Johnny . " Jim 's identification makes sense . For any one to impersonate Chester Erb successfully , it had to be some one who knew quite a bit about him . Another schoolmate , perhaps some one who lived near the Erbs and knew the rest of the family . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street from the Erbs for a while , " said Jim Hayes . " He knew the family all right . " " Enough to bother Wallace Erb , for a while , " Johnny offered . " Lieutenant , I think it 's time you called Wallace Erb in for a bit of questioning . "  | " I will , " said Cantrell . " I 'm not afraid of him . Even if Fleishacker is . " " Get him , now . I 'd like to be in on it . " " If you can keep your mouth shut and let me do the talking . . . . " " I will . Just get him down here . In the meantime I 'll write down three or four questions you can pop at him . "  | Chapter Twenty-one Wallace Erb came to headquarters a half hour later . Lieutenant Cantrell had gotten rid of the chief , who had wanted no part of Wallace Erb anyway . Erb came in , wearing a rough tweed suit , an Alpine hat with a brush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was twisted in its usual sardonic manner . He looked from one to the other of the three men , giving Johnny a little sneer . Then his eyes came to rest on Jim Hayes . " Have n't I seen you somewhere ? " he asked . Hayes nodded . " Hello , Mr. Erb . I 'm Jim Hayes . " " Ah ! Chester 's schoolmate . How are you , Hayes ? " " Well enough . " Erb nodded to Cantrell . " You wanted to see me , Lieutenant . " " I wanted to ask you some questions . Two murders have been committed here this week , and ? " " And you think I had something to do with them ? " Erb interposed .  | " I did n't say that . I only want to ask you some questions . " " Certainly . I have no objections to answering questions . By the way , where is the chief  --  Mr. Fleishacker ? " " He 's gone duck hunting , " retorted Cantrell . " He left me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , go ahead , Lieutenant . Ask your questions . " " All right , Mr. Erb . The first is  --  where were you Tuesday night ? Between eleven and eleven thirty ? " Erb uttered a short , humorless laugh . " Right to the point , eh , Lieutenant ? Let me see , Tuesday evening . Hmm , I believe I was at home . " " Between eleven and eleven thirty ? " " I do n't recall when I got home . I was out for a while but it seems to me I got in rather early . Yes , I 'm quite sure it was before eleven o'clock . " " Then you were at home when Alfred Orpington telephoned . You got the call yourself ? " Erb answered that question promptly ; too promptly , it seemed to Johnny Fletcher . " Sorry , no one by the name of Orpington telephoned . " Cantrell looked at Johnny . " Orpington called from the Carter-Lambert Hotel . The operator made out a charge slip for the call . She wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a mistake , " said Erb , smoothly . " Or perhaps he called one of my servants . I have quite a few people working out there on my place , you know . " Cantrell began biting his lower lip . " All right , we 'll let that question pass , Mr. Erb . We 'll jump to the next day . A man named Earl Chester and an attorney named Martin Hatch , called at your place . " " That 's right . Since you have Martin Hatch in custody you 've probably heard his wild story . " " We have . He claims that Earl Chester represented himself as your missing long-lost nephew , Chester Erb . It was about that they called on you , was n't it ? " " Of course . They were very modest in their demands . All they wanted was a half million dollars . " " And you refused ? " " Since I knew very well that man who called himself Chester was not my long-lost nephew as you put it  --  of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your nephew ? " Erb shrugged . Then he looked at Jim Hayes . " I imagine Mr. Hayes here , has looked at the body . He 's told you it is n't Chester ? " " Yes . However , he has identified the body . It 's some one who was known as Charles Plennert . " A gleam came into Erb 's eyes and Johnny knew  | that he had not been aware of Earl Chester 's real identity . " Plennert used to live across the street from Chester . " " The name is vaguely familiar , Lieutenant . Go on. , , " Apparently Charlie Plennert , having once known your nephew and getting in with an  --  at the risk of slander I 'll say it  --  an unscrupulous attorney , they decided to see if they could n't shake you down . You refused utterly , however . Is n't that right ? " " Yes . " " Then , " said Lieutenant Cantrell . " Why did n't you report the matter to the police ? " " I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty years no less than a dozen persons have come to me and claimed to be my nephew . I just ignored them and that was as far as it usually went . " Cantrell nodded . " Then , " he said , " since you knew they were frauds , why did you go with them that evening to a crap game at the Carter-Lambert ? " Wallace Erb glanced at Johnny and a little smile came over his lips . " A crap game ? Sorry , I do n't shoot craps . It 's illegal , you know . " " I know , " Cantrell snapped impatiently . " I 'm not trying to trick you into confessing to a misde-  | meanor . But there was a crap game and you were there . " " Well , " Erb said , carelessly , " I have n't admitted it ; but , hypothetically speaking , suppose there had been a crap game at the Carter-Lambert and I had been there ? " " If you had , " Cantrell said , wolfishly , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Earl Chester . " " Yes ? " purred Wallace Erb . " Well , would n't it strike you as strange that you would go out  --  for an evening 's pleasure  --  with a couple of extortionists ? " Wallace Erb chuckled . " Not necessarily . You see , in one or two instances previously , when these phony heirs came to me they actually started legal proceedings . Of course the cases were thrown out of the court , but in the meantime I 'd been forced to spend some money defending myself . Well .. . a client without any money is no asset to an attorney . I thought it would save me some money in the long run if I could arrange it so that Hatch 's client  --  this man whom you say is named Charlie Plennert  --  could be painlessly removed from his money . So I took them to this hypothetical crap game . " Lieutenant Cantrell stared in amazement at Wallace Erb . Johnny said , " There 's something to that , Lieutenant . This No-Dice Bobby Coons could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Erb  --  how did you know that ? " " Oh , I had met the gentleman before . Somewhere in the east when he was conducting a gambling club . I became rather well acquainted with him and he showed me numerous tricks . . . . " " Such as throwing a seven with a dice cup ? " Johnny asked . " I believe that was one of the tricks . " Johnny scowled . " He could do that ? The dirty so-and-so ! . .. " Cantrell showed some interest . " How could he stack dice if you used a dice cup ? " " Why , it 's really very simple , " Erb said . " Although I can not do it myself , I 've seen this  --  this Coons , perform the trick . Amazing dexterity . You could take a slow-motion picture of him doing it and you would n't believe it . You  --  Fletcher  --  if you ever saw him perform , you knew he would drop the dice into the cup , then partially cover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only one dice in to the cup . The other he palmed . He made up for the lack of the one dice by making a furious racket with the cup  --  leading the other players to believe there were actually two dice in it . " Johnny scowled . " All right , suppose he only had one dice in the cup and he palmed the other .  | That gave him control over one dice . He could n't be sure . " " Ah , but he could . Because you see when he threw out the dice , he rolled them through his hand . In that fraction of a second , he would catch the dice that came out of the cup and by sense of feel , twist it to match the one in his hand . Then he would roll out both dice  --  regulated by his hands . " " I do n't believe it ! " snorted Cantrell . Johnny shook his head . " I can hardly believe it myself . Except that I saw it pulled . The other night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the money  --  Coons had just pulled the stunt on me , using a glass for a dice cup . As a matter of fact he called the exact throw  --  six-one ! " Cantrell frowned . " But he lost the night of the big game ! " Johnny said hastily : " There must have been a slip-up somewhere . Mr. Erb , do n't you think . . . " Erb grinned crookedly . " Let it all come out . Coons lost that night , because Fletcher here threw in a pair of his own dice . " Johnny winced . " But I did n't use them , Cantrell . Honest . " Cantrell looked bitterly at Johnny . " But they were phony ? " " All right , they were loaded to throw only high points . The bellboy at the hotel bought them for  | me . By accident . I wanted a pair of dice that I knew were honest , because I 'd suspected No-Dice of using loaded dice . I asked the kid at the hotel to buy some for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know it though . . . . " " I 'll talk to you about that later , Fletcher . " Cantrell consulted his slip of paper again . " To get back to this hypothetical crap game , Mr. Erb . How come you offered to stand good for No-Dice 's check ? " " Simply because I 'd asked him to trim Hatch and Chester and I was so sure that Coons could do it . No one was more surprised than I when Coons threw a crap . For a while I thought he did it purposely ? that he had made a deal with Hatch and Chester to double-cross me . " " Maybe he did , " Johnny suggested . " No-Dice would double-cross his own mother . " " Chester had five g 's on his body when we found him , " growled Cantrell . Johnny was startled . " They did n't frisk him ? " Wallace Erb swung his cane jauntily . " Well , Lieutenant , since you 've cleared up all the details of this hypothetical crap game , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ auction tomorrow and there are some details I must look after . . . . " Cantrell said : " Where was Mrs. Erb , your wife , on Tuesday evening ? "  | " Where did she say she was ? " Erb countered . " She did n't say . I have n't asked her . " " Then do . I 'm sorry . My wife often visits friends and I do not always accompany her . Well , good afternoon , Lieutenant . " " One more question , Mr. Erb ! It 's about Chester ? your nephew . What is your own opinion ? Regarding his disappearance twenty years ago ? " " My opinion , " said Wallace Erb , " is that my nephew went swimming and was drowned . " " Hey , " cried Johnny . " He disappeared in February . " " Very well , then he went skating and broke through the ice . " And with that Wallace Erb grinned crookedly and walked out of the room . Lieutenant Cantrell began swearing dispassionately . " The Goddam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bucks he can do any Goddam thing he wants and talk the way he pleases to any one . If I only could get something definite on him , believe me , I 'd ? " He looked sourly at Johnny Fletcher . " You , Fletcher , you were going to spring something on him . " " He gave the wrong answers , " Johnny retorted . " Anyway  --  you told me to keep my mouth shut . " " And now I 'm telling you to get the hell out of here . You , Hayes , stick around town a day or two .  | I may want to ask you some stuff if anything pops into my mind . " Hayes nodded shortly and he and Johnny left the police station . They encountered Sam Cragg on the sidewalk . Johnny 's friend had a worried look on his face . " Johnny , some guy from the newspaper telephoned . Said his name was Pop Peebles and he had what you asked for a couple of days ago . " " Damn ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was going to have some photostats made for me . Uh  --  care to come along to the newspaper office , Hayes ? " " Nothing else to do in this burg , is there ? " " Not now . This evening , we 'll lift a few and see what makes the town tick . Sam , is that our jalopy over there by the fire plug ? " " Yeah , it 's got a ticket on it . I 've been afraid to get into it , because that cop on the corner 's laying for us . " " We 'll give him a run for his money . Let 's make a rush for it , then a quick U turn and away . We 'll tear up his lousy ticket and let him try to find us later . " It was old stuff for Johnny Fletcher and Sam Cragg , but Jim Hayes not being used to it was slow in piling into the car . Johnny had already started the motor and shifted into second , when Hayes  | finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corner traffic cop 's whistle . Johnny ignored the cop , made a successful U turn and zoomed up the street to the newspaper office . He led the way into the building , cried " Hi , Beautiful , " to the switchboard operator and proceeded unheeding , to the morgue . They found Pop Peebles cutting up newspapers with a huge pair of shears . " Mr. Fletcher ! " he exclaimed in pleasure . " I got those photostats for you . Here . . . . " He shoved away a stack of newspapers and picked up two huge photoprints . " I got them full-size of the newspaper . No extra charge . " Johnny began examining the photoprints and the old morgue keeper rambled on . " I got a new theory on this Chester Erb case . I figure maybe I 'll send it in to Clever Crime Cases . It 's about those brats , who claimed they was pals of Chester . They 're the ones that done him in . They got into a fight , killed him , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theory , " said Johnny , " what were the names of those  --  brats ? " " Archie Fitzgerald and Jim Hayes . They was the last ones to see ? " " Pop , " Johnny said , " meet Jim Hayes ! " The old man almost had convulsions . " Wh-whwhat ? " he choked .  | " Jim , " Johnny chuckled , " Shake hands with Pop Peebles , a swell newspaperman . " But Pop backed away from Jim Hayes ' outstretched hand . " T'ai n't so , Fletcher . You 're ribbing me . " Johnny turned one of the photoprints so Pop could see it . " Take a look at his mug here . Do n't it look like him  --  with a hangover and twenty years later ? " Pop looked at the print , then at Jim Hayes . He began clearing his throat . " I was on'y kidding , mister . Honest , I was . I got an altogether different theory . Chester joined the army and got killed in the war . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was only 14 in 1919 . . . . " " I did n't say what war , did I ? " Pop cried . " Maybe it was the Chinese-Jap war . How do I know ? ... " Johnny was n't listening . He was staring at one of the photoprints  --  at a small , two paragraph item in the lower right-hand corner . An Associated Press item that had nothing to do with the Chester Erb case , but was merely a piece of filler news material . " Pop , " he said , slowly , " your theories are all wet . I 've just solved the Chester Erb case ! " Pop , Jim Hayes and Sam Cragg exclaimed in  | unison . " Who did it ? " the old man cried . " The uncle ? . . . " Johnny shook his head . " No , Wallace Erb did n't ... kill him . " " Well , come on , " Sam Cragg snarled . " Spill it . What became of the great Chester ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a telegram first . If the answer is what I think it 'll be ? it 's all over ! " " Ches is alive , Fletcher ? " Jim Hayes asked . Johnny nodded . " If the answer to the telegram is affirmative , yes . " Sam said bitterly : " Goddam you , Johnny . Keeping us in suspense until tomorrow . " " Ca n't be helped . I ca n't do anything about it until I 'm absolutely sure . And if you fellows knew about it before then you might  --  accidentally  --  tip my hand . " He folded the photoprints and tossed a bill on Pop Peebles ' desk . " Thanks , Pop , you helped me solve the case . " Outside , Sam Cragg said : " It 's five o'clock . How about putting on the feed bag ? I have n't had anything to eat since breakfast . " " Except your regular meals , Sam . Sorry , it 's got to wait a while . I want to run out to the fairgrounds for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sam said , " I once  | knew a couple of fellows who went to a fair to sell books . Remember , Johnny ? " " That was two other fellows , Sam . From a financial standpoint , we 've done all right this week , have n't we ? Then what 're you grousing about ? Coming along , Jim ? " Jim Hayes pulled away from the flivver . " No , I guess I better find me a cheap room somewhere . " " You wo n't find any . The town 's jammed with cash customers . You can bunk in with us ? " " Yeah , " cracked Sam . " The last fella did that got his throat cut . Alfred Orpington . " Johnny scowled at his partner . " Cut out the clowning , Sam . Come on , Jim , I got you out here and I 'm taking care of you . Nobody 'll hurt you at the fair . " Hayes was still reluctant , but Johnny finally shoved him into the car . Then he took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Cedar City to the fairgrounds . He gave the ticket sellers a break and paid for three admissions . He complained , however , when he found no room in the officials ' parking space for his own car . He finally solved the parking problem by leaving the flivver in front of the entrance to the poultry building , where it almost blocked the door . Craning his neck to look over the rows of coops  | he avoided Lord Mike Seymour 's stand and led his small party down to the fox section . Judge Orrin popped out at him . " Ah , Mr. Fletcher ! " he boomed . " I was afraid you 'd gone home . I 've got a swell ad and layout here all ready for you . Look . . . . " He pulled a sheet of paper from his pocket and unfolded it . Johnny barely glanced at it . " But that 's only for one page . I want a two-page spread . I just had a wire from my farm manager who tells me my foxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Vancouver Fox Show ? " exclaimed Judge Orrin . " That was held a month ago ! " " I know . But I have n't been home since then . I want a two-page ad . Make it good and hot , too . Fletcher Foxes sweep the great Vancouver Fox Show . Lay it on , mister  --  and show me your layout tomorrow . " He brushed past the little fox judge . A silverfox cape had caught his eye in the next aisle . He met it at the end just as the cape was turning into his own aisle . Johnny said : " Hi , Pat ! " and stepped aside so Patricia Erb was facing Jim Hayes . She stared at Jim Hayes . The color left her rouged cheeks . Her nostrils flared and her lips parted . " Jim ! " she gasped .  | " Patsy Springer . . . is n't it ? " Jim Hayes asked . His voice was casual , but Johnny knew that Hayes was making one of the greatest efforts of his life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You . . . did this ? " Johnny turned deliberately away from Patricia Erb . He raised himself to his toes and looked across a row of coops . " I 'll be darned , " he said , " There 's Homer McChesney . Sam  --  it 's Homer over there ! " He caught Sam 's thick wrist and tugged at it . They left Patricia Erb standing before the row of foxes , with Jim Hayes . Safely away , Sam Cragg said : " That was a dirty trick , Johnny . Bringing those two together . " " Maybe , " said Johnny . " And maybe not . Jim 's at the bottom of the hole and ca n't get any lower . And Patsy  --  it serves her right . In his place I 'd slap her teeth out . Imagine paying for a fur coat after the dame 's gone and married another guy ! " He cleared his throat noisily . " I guess I 'll go send that telegram . " There was a telegraph office on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cragg from seeing the text . " You 'll know tomorrow , Nosey . " When they returned to the fox exhibit Patricia Erb and Jim Hayes had disappeared . Johnny shrugged . " He 'll turn up later . "  | Jim Hayes did turn up later . But it was a few minutes after midnight . He knocked hesitantly on the door of Room 515 at the Carter-Lambert and Johnny admitted him . Hayes was rather tight about the mouth . " Hello , fellows , " he said . Sam Cragg stretched out on one of the beds , took his eyes from the copy of Love Confessions he was reading . " This guy got the girl , " he remarked . " That 's only in a story , " Jim Hayes replied , evenly . " But it 's a true story . It says so right here , see ! . . . " Johnny snarled . " Shut your trap , Sam . Let 's hit the hay . It 's been a large day . "  | Chapter Twenty-two Some one pounding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the cramped bed he was sharing with Sam Cragg and discovered Jim Hayes , already fully dressed , opening the door . " Telegram for you , Fletcher , " he said . Sam Cragg sat up in bed . " What 's it say , Johnny ? " Johnny ripped open the envelope and took out the yellow sheet . He glanced at it and handed it to Jim Hayes . Hayes read aloud for Sam 's benefit : " Yes . Boy was put in local home for juvenile delinquents , but escaped June 2 , 1920 . Present whereabouts unknown . Jerome Saxon , Chief of Police , Seattle , Washington . " " That , " said Johnny , " refers to Chester Erb . " Jim Hayes nodded . " Juvenile delinquent ; I 'm not surprised . So he was n't killed , or kidnaped . Hmm , I 'd like to have seen the telegram you sent to get this answer . "  | " That wo n't be necessary , Jim . You 'll see Chester Erb today . In fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " " Here ? In Cedar City . He 's in Cedar City ? " " Yep . And I think he 'll be at the fur auction , out at the Wallace Erb estate . It 's scheduled to start at 9:30 . We 'll get breakfast and run right out there . " A dozen taxicabs and twenty-five or thirty automobiles of various sizes and models were parked in the space between the Erb residence and the long barracks behind , when Johnny Fletcher squeezed their flivver in between a Packard and Cadillac . As they walked toward the barracks , Johnny remarked : " They tell me fur buyers from all over the country attend these auctions and the deals run into boxcar numbers . " Jim Hayes puffed nervously at a cigarette , then tossed it away , two thirds unsmoked . " How long is this going to take ? " " Oh , the auction 'll take all day . I understand they 're going to sell twenty thousand pelts . Breeders from all around bring them here and I understand Erb himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know a dame in Miami 'd give her eyeteeth for  | a couple of those pelts , " Sam Cragg said wistfully . " If I could snag them . . . " " Never give furs to a dame , Sammy , " Johnny chided . Then he winced . " Sorry , Jim ! " A man with a shotgun in the crook of his arm stood outside the door of the barracks , but he merely looked at the trio as they entered . The bunks in the barracks had evidently been cleared out , for one entire side of the long room was lined with tables on which , piled four and five feet high , were silver-fox furs . Each pile was labeled with a tag . Buyers were walking around , fingering the furs and making notes on pads . Several rows of chairs had been lined up in the center of the room and at the far end was a raised platform on which Wallace Erb and several men were engaged in spirited conversation . Johnny searched the room for persons he knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first row of chairs . In a corner , Judge Orrin was talking animatedly to Ben Longstreet whose face was sourer than ever . Lieutenant Cantrell , accompanied by Chief of Police Fleishacker were fingering silver-fox furs near the auctioneer 's platform . When Cantrell saw Johnny Fletcher , he deserted the chief and came over .  | " All right , fella , " he said . " Point out your man and I 'll put the collar on him . And if you 're wrong , I 'll put the hook on you . " " Get me sore , and I 'll quit , Cantrell , " Johnny said . " I 'm not getting anything out of this , anyway . " " I know , that 's why I ca n't understand why you 've been sticking your fingers in the pie . " " Because your pie was getting all messed up . You had strawberries in your ears and whipped cream in your eyes . You could n't see a damn thing . " " All right , Fletcher , " Cantrell said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For a while . Have your fun , but just do n't forget that I 'm here . . . . " Johnny swung away impatiently and collided with Patricia Erb who was coming forward , her eyes on Jim Hayes . She was wearing a simple woolen suit today and she wore only a fraction of her customary make-up . Johnny thought her much more attractive . " Jim , " she said , to Jim Hayes . " I want to talk to you . " Jim Hayes looked over Patricia Erb 's golden head and said , deliberately : " Good morning , Mr. Erb ! " Wallace Erb had come down from the platform . " You going to stay for this , Patricia ? " he asked . " No need , you know . " " I 'd like to watch , if you do n't mind , Wally . " p 300 Wallace Erb shrugged without looking at his wife . His eyes were on Jim Hayes . One of the men on the platform banged a gavel upon a table . He said in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to begin the Cedar Valley SilverFox Auction . You 've all examined the various lots of furs and you know that you 've never seen a finer selection of silver foxes anywhere in this country . Those of you who are fortunate enough to obtain furs at this sale will go back to your factories with the knowledge that you 've bought the best there is to be had . Now , then , I 'm ready to start with Lot Number One . Fifty select furs produced by one of the finest fox breeders in this country , our host , Mr. Wallace Erb . . . . What am I offered for Lot Number One ? " A buyer shouted : " Ten dollars ! " " Ten dollars ? " cried the auctioneer . " Gentlemen , we 're not selling rabbit skins here . They 're silver foxes and Lot Number One is the cream of Mr. Erb 's crop . There is n't a skin in that lot that is n't worth five hundred dollars each . Come , come , I know you must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this auction . We 've got to work faster . " " I could give a better spiel myself , " Johnny said to Patricia Erb out of the corner of his mouth . " I 'll bet you could , " she retorted .  | Wallace Erb sniffed . " Oh , you 're the book agent . Selling furs is different ! " " Is it ? What do you figure your auctioneer will get for your Lot Number One ? " " In the neighborhood of $150 per skin . " Johnny said , through his teeth : " I 'll bet you five thousand dollars I can get two hundred dollars a skin . " " Ten thousand dollars for the fifty furs ? " " Yes . " " Fletcher , " said Wallace Erb , " you 've made a bet ! " " ... Thirty-five dollars ? " cried the auctioneer . " Come , come , gentlemen ! . . . " Wallace Erb stepped up to the platform and whispered in the auctioneer 's ear . The latter replied heatedly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and banged the table with his gavel . " Gentlemen , " he announced , " it seems we have an amateur auctioneer in the house who wants to try his spurs . I am therefore yielding the floor temporarily to  --  to Mr. . . . ah , Mr. Fleisher ! " " Fletcher is the name , " Johnny sang out , " Johnny Fletcher ! " He headed for the auctioneer 's platform . Sam Cragg , who had not heard the wager , came out of a sudden trance and started for Johnny . The latter ignored him and stepped up to the platform .
