txt Attitude of Czechoslovakia To THE EDITOR OP THE NEW YORK TIMES : I was pleased by the excellent reporting and keen observation shown by your correspondent , James Reston , in his article in your issue of Aug. 5 , describing the present conditions in Czechoslovakia and presenting a clear picture of things now going on in that country . Having returned from Europe only a short time ago , and having spent several months in Czechoslovakia , I am convinced that Mr. Reston 's description is correct . The more am I disappointed that certain circles here have such little understanding of the situation in Czechoslovakia , forgetting that this state was founded by one of the most democratic men of our times , Thomas G. Masaryk , and that men like Dr. Eduard Benes and Jan Masaryk still enjoy the greatest popularity there , despite the changed general conditions in Europe . Is n't it a great merit , to be especially appreciated by the United States , which is now leading the world in its endeavor for a lasting peace , that Czechoslovakia tries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face of continuous difficulties has avoided requesting any mediation or interventkon of international institutions , such as has been practiced by other countries ? I believe that such an attitude should be recognized and that it deserves confidence . It eis the more deplorable that the question of a loan for Czechoslovakia has found so few intercessors . RICHARD M. JERIE . Richmond Hill , L. I. , Aug. 16 , 1947.
