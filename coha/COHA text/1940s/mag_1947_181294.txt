A narrow-gauge railway , wood-burning and rachitic , is the regular transport over the 1,000 miles between Rio and the boomtown of Anapolis , in Goiaz ( see map ) . It takes four days &; nights by rail to reach Anapolis , gateway to the rich backlands , and longer if the trip is made by road . But from the lush lowlands of the north and the coffee fazendas to the south , 50,000 Brazilians a year are passing through muddy , roughhewn Anapolis in search of new homes and new times , just as U.S. pioneers a century ago left the Atlantic coast and headed west . <P> Many who come to Anapolis are on their way to the new Government Colonia Agricola Nacional and its embryonic town of Ceres . The Colonia , one of seven set up by Dictator Vargas in 1941 , and the most successful , is an experiment in agrarian socialism . To poor men it holds out the promise of free land , home , security . <P> The Engineer . In the Colonia the man who has made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named Bernardo Sayao Carvalho Araujo. * He knows the backlands , understands their need for large-scale immigration , and knows all about their lack of good roads and railways . A leader who wants to know how a man gets along with his neighbors , , how his crops are coming , he calls by first name many of the 15,000 settlers in the Colonia . Last week he was in Rio seeking money for the Colonia , for the Government had paid not a cruzeiro of the funds appropriated for it for this year . <P> The Colonia 's soil is the loamy terra roxa ( red earth ) that Brazilians prize most . After two years ' full operation , the farms , for which the Government gives seeds and advice , burgeon with fat crops of rice , 15-ft. corn , sugar cane thick as a truck driver 's wrist , beans planted among the corn to keep the ground rich and productive . Says Sayao : " They do n't mind planting vegetables , but are horrified at the idea of eating them . ' Makes you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catching on , and on better-balanced diets already look healthier . With good soil and modern methods , they surpassed their own food needs the first year . <P> Building a Lifeline . Engineer Sayao , an old Government roadbuilder , faced the crisis in communications in his own way . The first thing he did in 1941 , when Goiaz rice sold for 15 a bag for lack of transport to markets , was to cut a trail to Anapolis through 100 miles of forests . He soon turned this into the state 's best road . Down it last year the colony 's trucks carried 30 different products to market-including 20,000 bags of sugar , 12,000,000 pounds of watermelon , 120,000 dozen eggs , 50 jaguar skins . <P> In 1945 it was different : the whole rice crop rotted for lack of gasoline to get it to market . The following year Sayao wheedled the Government into shipping an abandoned sugar mill from the coast , set it up in Ceres , and distilled enough alcohol from the colony 's sugar to keep the trucks on the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bags of rice in Sao Paulo at prices ranging from $3 to $4.50 a bag .
