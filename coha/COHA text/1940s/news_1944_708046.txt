txt Returning From France , Sept. 2 ? How we caught the German Nineteenth ) Army in its retreat up the Rhone River and destroyed more material in a given time and space than had ever been done before is one of the classics of this war . Students of combined air-ground tactics will learn from this example how it should be done as long as war is war . Brig . Gen. Gordon Saville , commander of the Twelfth Tactical Air Command , who flew with us today over the burned and blackened path of slaughter from Mont611-mar to Livron , called it " as nearly perfect an example of what to do as one can hope to find . " In a stretch of about twenty miles , 2,200 vehicles , 1,500 horses and hundreds of railway cars were destroyed in five days . We flew from Rome before dawn this morning to see their scarred remains before the engineers cleared away the mute and terrible evidence of the German death-trap . There was nothing haphazard or accidental about what happened . Lieut . Gen. Alexander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Navy chipped in with a carrier force of Seafires and Hellcats . It all fitted in with a general strategic plan that could not get under way until D-day to avoid giving our plans away . On that day , the bridges at Sisteron were cut and the Germans were blocked from rushing reinforcements into the beachhead . On the same afternoon , the systematic bombing of the bridges over the Rhone began , and it was carried out so successfully that not a single bridge was left standing between the mouth of the river and Lyon . It is impossible today to get a truck over from one side of the river to the other anywhere along that stretch . Medium bombers did most of that work , with some help from heavy bombers . The German forces around the mouth of the Rhone were gradually being squeezed . Some had managed to cross over to the east bank before the bridges were cut ? or by ferry . Others were being pushed back before the lightning advance of the Americans past Toulon and Marseille . The Nineteenth Army had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the American force then became to destroy as much of it as possible . It was at about that time that the , American column had made a swift dash northward to Grenoble . Generals Patch and Saville sat down to calculate the means at their disposal and the time that it would take for the fleeing Germans to reach a given point . Their strategy was to block the Germans ' route , forcing them to pile up in a confined space , and then to smash them . River Junction Chosen The place chosen was Livron , where the ** River meets the Rhone . The Tactical Air Force wiped out the bridges over the DrOme and for two and a half days it kept pounding away at the German column as it gradually piled up like a closing telescope . Strafing by Thunderbolt , Seafires and Hellcats did this job and kept at it . Meanwhile an infantry column with something like six battalions of artillery moved swiftly across from Grenoble and established positions on the heights above Livron . The terrain was perfect for the operation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rhone on one side and the narrow stretch below the heights on the other . And then the slaughter began in earnest  --  and there has probably never been such slaughter before . American infantry troops were keeping a standing patrol to fire on the Germans as they tried to break through , even without their vehicles . The Germans clearly did not realize what they were up aggainst until too late , for prisoners admitted that they had thought that they were meeting only reinforced French patriots until they lost almost everything that they had . One Defect Unavoidable It was a field of carnage unprecedented in the European campaign . However , the tactic necessarily had one weakness , which was that the ground forces at the disposal of the command were naturally weaker than the German ground forces . since they had the equivalent of two divisions pushing north . Moreover , the American troops were , in the nature of things , on the defensive , while the Germans could mass and break through by sheer weight . This , it will be recalled , many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot . Behind them they left a solidly banked mass of broken and burned vehicles and dead men and horses that stretched almost uninterruptedly from Montelimar to Livron . That was the fearful road of destruction over which we flew today . We came over badly bombed Arles , Tarascon and Avignon , their broken bridges looking fragile from the air . Our plane circled around them in 30-degree banks and buzzed over the roofless houses of these famous towns where the troubadours sang in olden times. , And then , at Montelimar , the path Of slaughter began . We skimmed at tree-top level alongside a road . The charred hulks of vehicles were jumbled into heaps of scrap iron . Dead horses lay in neat rows where the French had put them preparatory to burial . The skeletons of railway cars stood forlornly on or beside , the tracks , with now and then the wreck of one of seven 14-inch railway guns that were destroyed in those infernal five days . The houses along the highway had gone down under the hail of bombs and shells . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing but charred heaps of metal . The Drone River crosses the highway at right angles just north of Livron . It should be a famous spot in the history of this campaign , for it was there that a road block was put down and held against fleeing German columns . About a third of the bridge where the road joins it from the south was down . Cars were strewn like broken toys on the almost dry bed of the river . On we went to the switchyards south of Valence , where we saw another virtually perfect example of what to do . Hundreds of freight cars had been massed there , and every one had been smashed or immobilized . The station and warehouses were shells . Our journey ended on a field in that region that had been taken the day before and used for the first time today . The American air engineers and air force are now so experienced that within five days at the maximum from capturing any given field it is in operation , and that was how the Americans carried out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " As General Saville pointed out , since it was the Germans who were coming up , that was not a good characterization . " I would call it ' operation piledriver , ' " he said .
