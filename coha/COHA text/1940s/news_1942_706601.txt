txt WASHINGTON , July 18 ? Contracts with the Higgins Corporation of New Orleans for the building of 200 Liberty Ships were canceled today by the Maritime Commission , which also announced curtailment of all further ship plant construction throughout the country because of the need for using available steel for building ships . The decision was taken with the concurrence of the War Production Board , the commission stated . The Higgins contracts were let in March and apparently are the only ones affected by the order . The commission declared that the Higgins yards could not be in " full scale " production until 1943 and required the- creation of " vast new facilities such as shipways , shops , maghine tools , railroads , and transportation and housing for workers . " The steel required for these purposes " would best be diverted to existing construction , " said the commission . It was asserted that the curtailment order would not affect yards now under construction and " about to produce . " Soon after the Maritime Commission announced cancellation of its contracts with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Federation of Labor , thousands of members of whose affiliated unions will lose their jobs in the Higgins yards as the result of the commission 's decision , called at the White House . Steel requirements of the armed forces have reduced allocations for merchant shipbuilding and the commission said existing shipbuilding facilities would be more than ample to utilize the present and prospective allocation of steel . But the commissior stated that its " announced program of new shipping to be completed by the end of 1943 will be met . " If more steel becomes available it can be increased , said the statement . The Maritime Commission 's statement was as follows : " The Maritime Commission today // CANCELS CONTRACTS FOR 200 CARGO SHIPS // announced that due to the need for utilizing all available steel in ship building in existing ship-building plants and facilities , further plant expansion programs must be curtailed . The War Production Board has concurred with the Maritime Commission in this decision , and directed curtailment of the use of steel . " Fc.r this reason the Maritime Commission 's contracts with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The ship contract called for 200 Liberty , ships . " The commission said that the curtailment of expansion of ship building facilities would channel the available amount of steel info existing shipyards so that maximum immediate production of ships would be available . " The commission explained that due to need of steel for military and naval requirements there has been allocated to the Maritime Commission a curtailed quota of steel for merchant ship building . However , because of the increased rate of production which has risen from best original estimates for four to four and one half ships per way per year to six to eight ships per way per year , the existing ship building facilities will be more than ample to utilize the present and prospective allocation of steel . " In view of these facts it would be unwise to divert steel for expansion of facilities to a capacity greater than the amount of steel available for our merchant ship building . Expanded Program Delayed " Although this revision in the allocation of steel has made it necessary to curtail a projected expanded program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the end of 1943 will be met . If more steel becomes available this program can be increased . " Inasmuch as it would be 1943 before the Higgins yards could be in full-scale production , and because the Higgins program necessitates the creation of vast new facilities such as ship ways , shops , machine tools , railroads and transportation and housing for workers , the amount of steel required would best be diverted into existing construction . " It is pointed out that Higgins 's original estimate for facilities was approximately $29,000,000 which later was revised upwards to a total of $59,000,000 , not including costs for power requirements of some $6,000,000 or a total for facilities , which would have been borne by the Maritime Commission , of $65,000,000 . Thid represents the highest cost per ship to be constructed under any of the Maritime Commission 's contracts . A detailed survey of the project indicated that the Higgins assembly line method was well engineered and feasible , and would produce ships at a rapid rate if the necessary steel were available .
