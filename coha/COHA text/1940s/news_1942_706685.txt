txt BUENOS AIRES , Aug. 22 ? Brazil 's declaration of war upon Germany and Italy following the sinking by German submarines of five Brazilian ships forming part of a convoy in waters off the coast of Brazil came as a rude shock to those South Americans who imagined the war was taking . place so far from their shores that it did not even distantly concern them . Now Mars himself is knocking at the door of every South American country on the Atlantic seaboard , and he is making such a din about it that even the deaf can not pretend they do not hear . Consequently there are very few South Americans who are not willing to admit that the spread of the battle of the Atlantic southward has created new problems . The problems are mostly the result of South America 's geographical configuration , which makes communications between one republic and another difficult except by sea . The chain of the Andes , running the whole length of the continent , impedes east-west communications between the Atlantic and Pacific Coasts , while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unprofitable to move goods overland in a north-south direction . Gloomy Forebodings Most South American republics , therefore , would die an economic death if they could not use the sea for the normal purposes of their foreign trade , and this fact is so universally recognized that the invasion of the South Atlantic by Axis submarines has filled most South Americans with gloomy forebodings . Though the danger is common to at least all South American countries on the Atlantic seaboard , reaction to it has not been uniform . Of course , Brazil , as an injured party that has suffered not only material damage but also an affront to her national dignity , is the country where the anti-Axis outcry was loudest and most violent . Second only to Brazil came little Uruguay , which immediately offered to Brazil her " total solidarity , " and made it clear she would carry out her Pan-American commitments even if a shooting war came to the South Atlantic . Venezuela , Colombia and other South American republics expressed solidarity with Brazil in varying degrees . In Argentina Foreign Minister Enrique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to express his government 's regrets when the sinkings were first announced and most papers published editorials strongly stigmatizing the submarine war against peaceful nations , but there has been nothing even distantly resembling a popular movement against the Axis . This lack of popular reaction Is due partly to the state of siege that for more than eight months has forbidden all public discussion of foreign affairs and partly to the fact that Argentina 's situation differs fundamentally from that of all other South American countries except Chile . Axis Is Cordial Whereas eight of the ten South American republics have broken off relations with the Axis , thereby laying themselves open to reprisals in the form of submarine attacks upon their shipping , Argentina and Chile continue to give hospitality to German , Italian and Japanese diplomats . As far as Argentina Is concerned Senor Ruiz Guillaztl was able to declare in the Chamber of Deputies on July 15 that Germany had thrown the seven seas open to Argehtine shipping . Despite past experiences ? the freighter Uruguay was torpedoed and sunk off the Spanish coast on May 28 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States coast on April 17 , 1942 , and later expropriated by the United States Government , and the freighter Rio Tercero torpedoed and sunk off the United States coast on June 22 , 1942  --  the Argentine Government evidently has confidence in Germany 's promises , and believes ships will be allowed to pass unscathed through seas in which the ships of other South American republics are liable to be sunk . Different Outlooks There is , consequently , a welldefined difference of attitude toward the- Axis submarine menace between the countries that have broken off relations and those that have not . Those that have severed relations realize that their position vis- ? - vis the Axis is in every respect similar to Brazil 's , and they . therefore feel the sinking of Brazilian ships as keenly as if their own shipping was being sent to the bottom . Those that have not broken off relations think , or at least hope , that the Axis will respect their ships , and therefore they regard the- sinkings as something regrettable , perhaps even extremely reprehensible , but really no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Argentinians are perhaps less revolted than other South American peoples by submarine sinkings of merchantmen because they are not very sea-minded . Their country contains more than half the total mileage of roads and railroads in the whole South American continent and they therefore rely little on the sea for transporting goods within their own country . The only important exception is crude oil , which is brought by sea from the port of Commodoro Rivadavia to Buenos Aires for refining . Overseas traffic is carried on mostly by foreign ships , and was almost exclusively so before state merchant fleet was formed last year . With the exception of the WARS WITH AXIS Cowan President Getulio Vargas seeks retribution for the sinkings of Brazilian ships by Axis U-boats . naval base at Puerto Ilelgrano , no important Argentine port is on the ocean . Buenos Aires and Rosario both are on rivers , Buenos Aires itself being about 200 miles from the ocean . It is doubtful whether what has happened to Brazil has any real effect in shaking that part of Argentine opinion that supports President Ramon Castillo 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably has a contrary effect . All that Argentinians can see is that Brazil broke off relations with the Axis only seven months ago and now already finds herself in a state Of war . On Castillo 's Policies From this they deduce that President Castillo was right when he took the position that a rupture of relations is merely the first step toward war and must in the long run lead to active participation in the conflict . And from this , in turn , those Argentinians who favor keeping out of war at . all costs  --  and ' they are a majority  --  deduce that a rupture of relations must be avoided as long as it possibly can . Since President Castillo is a visible symbol of neutrality , it follows that public opinion has swung rather toward him than away from him since the Rio de Janeiro conference , and Foreign Minister Ruiz Guifiazd also comes in for his share of praise from those circles that approve the isolationist policy of the Administration .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
