To U.S. citizens who still had faith in themselves and in their nation the words of Charles Augustus Lindbergh last week were a shock . Warning an America First rally in Fort Wayne , Ind. , that " it may be my last address , " Mr. Lindbergh reported in a strained voice : <P> &gt; " If free speech ends in this country , * it means that we are no longer a free people . It means that we are about to enter dictatorship and probably foreign war . " <P> &gt; " The people have been deceived . . . by the false promises of the interventionists and of our Administration . " <P> &gt; " Congress , like the Reichstag , is not consulted . " <P> &gt; " We are approaching a point where we are no longer governed by the will of the people . " + <P> &gt; " If the time comes when we can no longer meet face to face as free men in a free country we will meet together at the elections next year . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <P> &gt; " We must face the fact that you and I and our generation have lost our American heritage . " <P> &gt;- " I do not speak out of hate for any individual or any people . ... I have tried ... to give you the truth without prejudice or passion . " <P> Said young , martyred Mr. Lindbergh : " This is not a life that I enjoy . Speaking is not my vocation and political life is not my ambition . ... I have done this because I believe my country is in mortal danger . " <P> <P> *Refused a press pass into Mr. Lindbergh 's meeting , LIFE Photographer Wallace Kirkland slipped in , was ousted . <P> + According to a Gallup poll last week , 70% of the U.S. ( compared to 60% last January ) have decided that it is more important to defeat Hitler than to keep out of the war .
