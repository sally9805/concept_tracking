( See Cover ) Off the wet rocks where the seals bark and the tides rip , a rendezvous with a new land this week awaited a big grey ship , a plain man in an austere suit , and a motherly woman with friendly eyes . Under the high , tense arc of Golden Gate Bridge , John Curtin , Labor Leader and Prime Minister of Australia , and his wife Elsie would be getting their first view of the U.S. where it looks the most like home . It had been late summer three weeks ago as their ship passed under Sydney 's great bridge and between the dun-colored cliffs of The Heads to the open sea . This week the pale green of early spring was on the hills that hem in San Francisco Bay . <P> All his life Jack Curtin , 59 , had never felt the need to see the non-Australian world . Years ago , Vance Marshall , an Australian laborite now living in London , visited Jack in Perth . " I 'm on my way to England , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the endless , cloudless western sky . " Is n't there room enough in Australia ? " he finally asked . " Not for me , " ' retorted Marshall . " Australia 's in the back wash . It 's back of beyond of even the fringe of things that matter . I want to be where history is written . " <P> Jack reached for his well-worn hat , suggested a " walk-about . " They walked all afternoon , coming to the Esplanade beside the leisurely , looping Swan River at sunset . Said thoughtful Jack Curtin : " Vance , you should have said where past history is written . This is where history is going to be written . Why do n't you stay and help write it ? Australia 's big , Vance , not England . There 's room to breathe here , to grow , to live . " <P> Marshall and Curtin were both right . This week Jack Curtin , representative of an Australia newly conscious , was on his way to London to help write the future history of Commonwealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wartime meeting of Dominion Prime Ministers with almost as much interest as the invasion , there was much speculation as to how " Honest Jack " would stack against the plain &; fancy pressures he would find in Britain . Well did the men of politics recall the strange coincidence that Australian First Ministers who visit London while in office usually soon find themselves out of a job . Australians , they knew , liked their politicians plain , were quick to toss a man bemused by pomp &; circumstance . <P> Australia Is Big . Bumptious suspicion of life in the Great World is not merely an aspect of the " immaturity " of a colonial people . There is another side to it : Australians , like Americans before them , have felt no need of any pattern larger than their own . <P> Australia is almost as big as the U.S. ; it has almost the population of New York City ( the sheep population almost equals the U.S. human population ) . From Canberra ( pronounced Can-bra ) , near Sydney on the east coast , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Australia are inhabited ; the southeast , particularly , and a little around Perth on the west coast ( big-timber country ) and at Darwin up north in the tropics , then down the east coast to Brisbane where urban living starts again .
