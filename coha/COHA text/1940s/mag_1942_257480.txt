While millions of U.S. newspaper readers cheered , a comic-strip character had his 21st birthday last week . He was Skeezix Wallet , star of Frank King 's saga of homey , U.S. middle-class life , Gasoline Alley . Unlike most other comic-strip characters , Skeezix has grown every day since a flabbergasted Uncle Walt found him on the doorstep of his home . At Springfield 's Illinois State Museum , Skeezix 's birthday was celebrated with an exhibition of Cartoonist King 's original Skeezix drawings . They showed that , in the course of some 34,000 pictures of Skeezix , Cartoonist King 's draughtsmanship had grown almost as much as Skeezix himself .
