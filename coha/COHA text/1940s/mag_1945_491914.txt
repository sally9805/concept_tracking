The Paper That Was Tailored to a City By DAVID G. irITTELS HE greatest mystery in the newspaper business today is a fat , wealthy paper in Philadelphia called The Evening Bulletin . Outside the Quaker City , it is little known to the layman , except perhaps through reiteration of its provocative slogan : " In Philadelphia , Nearly Everybody Reads The Bulletin . " But among newspapermen The Bulletin is the subject of many baffled bull sessions , during which the professionals try to figure out how and why a paper like that should have the biggest evening circulation in the United States , which The Bulletin has . Its slogan is literally true , though in some newspaper circles it is apt to incite agonized remarks such as " but only God knows why , " and " it serves them right . " The Bulletin , with about 675,000 daily circulation , dominates its field perhaps more fully than any other paper in the country . In most newsrooms , certain truths are held to be self-evident and among them are these : that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and sophisticated in tone . The Bulletin is , broadly speaking , none of these things , and does n't even try to be . It is perhaps the most commonplace metropolitan newspaper in the country , it never crusades about anything , some of its editorials require two or three careful readings to determine whether they are pro or con , and it is so reluctant to offend the sensibilities of its readers that it has been known to paint extra clothes on some of the ladies in its comic strips and at least once cut the word " lousy " out of a strip , thereby virtually ruining the punch line . Even that acutely true-to-life small-fry character , " Stinky " Davis , in Fontaine Fox 's cartoon , Toonerville Trolley , was dipped into the sterilization tank and bowdlerized to " Stingy " Davis . Those are some of the reasons why the irreverent refer to it as The Old Lady of Filbert Street . The Bulletin 's success , to those of the reporting craft who possibly are more romantic than they should be , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Bulletin has ignored not only most of the fascinating sagas of the newsroom but also the supposedly practical , opportunistic tenets of the counting rooms . If no Bulletin reporter has ever had the thrill of working on a first-class expos ? , neither have the more prosaic departments ever resorted to prizes or premiums to lure new circulation , or cut advertising rates to gain new business . There has arisen a naive legend that The Bulletin is simply a case of dumb luck . Recently , a hot-shot New York expert came down to look over the Philadelphia newspaper scene . He wrote a forty-page report for his clients ; but privately , in the bar of the Pen and Pencil Club , he summed up The Bulletin thus : " That 's not a newspaper , it 's a symptom . " At least he was closer to the mark than was General Taylor , creator of the present Boston 14 Globe , during a visit some years ago to his good friend , the late William L. McLean , who made The Bulletin what it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professional eye ; and the more he studied , the greater his puzzlement grew . The peacetime headlines were small , drab and flat ; the news items under them written in commonplace fashion . The whole paper was a monotone ; there was no sparkle , no savor , no punch . " McLean , " he demanded at last , " how in hell do you sell this thing ? I could n't get away with something like that in Boston . " McLean , a tall , mild man with a wise , tolerant twinkle behind his spectacles , did not take offense . " Well , " he replied , " neither could ' ' ' . But I would n't try to sell The Philadelphia Bulletin in Boston . " Therein lies the first clue to the mystery of The Bulletin . The largest evening circulation in the United States is n't , of course , dumb luck . The Bulletin is the creation of a circulation genius who , though no editor , took the trouble and had the ability to study his public down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he learned to understand his market , and fashioned his business in accordance . To pursue that simile further , McLean tried to sell Philadelphia neither a soot suit nor a frock coat , but made up for it the plain , staid little number it seemed to want . He never argued with his customers , never tried to inculcate into them a taste for better style . Whether this method fulfills the whole function and duty of a news ' , paper is another matter . McLean deliberately made The Bulletin as typical of Philadelphia as its anachronistic City Hall , spraddling obstinately in the path of its two main streets ; the quiet dignity of Independence Hall ; the monotonous miles of row houses filled with solid , unspectacular workers ; the lovely , childlike quality of its Mummers ' Parade ; the Quaker-garbed statue of Billy Penn , and scrapple . The things great and the things bad about The Bul-letin are both products of The Chief , as his staff called him . His hand is still upon it , though now it is run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men of extraordinary ability in their own right . William L. , Jr. , former All-American tackle at Princeton and now vice-president and treasurer of the paper , still refers to his father , quite simply and reverentially , as The Chief . Robert , who has distinguished himself as president of the Associated Press , in addition to heading The Bulletin management and dictating its editorial policy , still sometimes lapses into the present tense in speak-ing of his father , dead thirteen years . Both served apprenticeships at the bottom , progressing through delivery , composing and newsroom ; and Robert still marks of those days on two fingers mashed in a 1-ieam hear machine while trying to set a new speed record in turning out a matrix . Both sons have adhered to the formula The Chief taught them . It is no magic formula ; the trick lay in recognizing it and applying it with painstaking care . Whatever The Bulletin does , in its columns or its business structure , it does with consistent thoroughness and minute attention to detail . This solid trait , composed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illustration , underlies every other factor in The Bulletin 's success . The Chief missed no bets , overlooked no angle . Recently , a new executive noted an odd item of $300 in a bill for signs advertising The Bulletin . It was for " antiquing . " Puzzled as to why brand-new signs should be antiqued , he pursued the mystery until finally , from an old-timer in the circulation department , he got the answer . " The Chief started that , " the ecient explained . The Chief said people in Phila'aelphia did n't like new things . He did n't want them to think The Bulletin was a new paper . " The Bulletin pursues the same thought today . Most papers , when they modernize their make-up , proudly and loudly proclaim their progress . When The Bulletin , a couple of years ago , made thirty changes in its heads and other matters of make-up , it did so at the rate of only one a day , so that the readers would not be disturbed by noticing that something new had been added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in 1895 for $73,000 ? largely borrowed  --  but it might just as well have been . Out of thirteen newspapers in the city then , with a combined circulation of more than 850,000 , The Bulletin had leas than 7000 . The record McLean made still stands to the amazement of modern circulation experts . In one year he increased the sales fivefold , to above 33,000 daily . In five years he was crowding 130,000 ; and on the tenth anniversary of his ownership The Bulletin was at the top of the heap with 220,000 ? a more than thirty-fold increase . It has never been headed in Philadelphia since . Today , not quite fifty years after he bought it , only two of his original competitors remain , and they have changed hands and had injections of new money several times . Estimates of the current value of The Bulletin go to $25,000,000 ? if the owners were crazy enough to sell . It is entirely a family-held concern . McLean 's background for newspaper ownership consisted of spectacular success as a youthful circulation hustler in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the old Philadelphia Press . Almost immediately after he bought the decrepit Bulletin , he plunged himself deeper in debt to increase its press capacity . Scoffed at , he replied , " The paper that gets to the newsstands and homes soonest with the latest news sells the most . " To this end , he was a daring innovator in his mechanical and delivery departments , and made them the most modern in the country . This tradition of modernity in plant has persisted . The staid Bulletin is put together in streamlined , air-conditioned , soundproofed , scientifically lighted offices which resemble more a Hollywood version of a tycoon 's suite than the traditional journalistic warrens . Only in the news and editorial branches was he cautious ; perhaps wisely , but perhaps because , not having had training in those departments , he did not PHOTOGRAPHY BY SAM FALK 15 know how to use the spices and condiments of journalism . He liked to pretend that he gave his editors a free hand , and told his sons , " If you always have to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well be the managing editor yourself . " The truth of the matter was diet , though he did it by indirection , he laid down very narrow limits for his editors . When once a reporter wrote and the managing editor put on Page 1 an expos ? of a gambling house running full tilt , The Chief came into the newsroom and , pointing to the story , quietly asked , " Do you think this is quite the sort of thing The Bulletin ought to do ? " He said no more , but the executive caught the hint . There were no more expos  --  s or crusades . If the police raid a place . The Bulletin prints that fact . If another paper forces an investigation of graft or other skulduggery , The Bulletin gives its readers the bare facts of the progress of the investigation  --  and of its inevitable demise . It never stirs up trouble on its own . Cleverness and sophisticated writing are taboo in its news columns . Dwight Perrin , the present managing editor , is too wise to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set of gears , but he has succeeded in getting a little flavor into the paper , partly by allowing a couple of his abler reporters to show flashes of top-notch newspaper style : Morley Cassidy , for instance , has been turning in one of the greatest jobs of war correspondence being done by any correspondent for a single newspaper . " The newspaper is a visitor in the home , " The Chief declared , " and so there should never he anything in it which conceivably could offend any member of the family . " There never is in The Bulletin . When Winnie Winkle was about to have her twins a few years ago , the editors decided that the strips for the week prior to the accouchement were too realistic for Bulletin readers . Scores of other newspapers printed them without qualm or resultant complaints , but The Bulletin made the syndicate cartoonist draw for its readers another , more delicate set . " If you use big headlines every day , " The Chief taught , " you will have nothing in reserve to emphasize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) 1 // THE PAPER THAT WAS TAILORED TO A CITY ( Continued from Page 15 ) comes . " He preached moderation and understatement , and his sons agree . The penetrating words Robert McLean wrote some time ago to explain The Bulletin theory to an advertising agency were his own , but they were also an echo of his father . " Understatement that carries conviction ( because the mind of the reader feels in it the sense that it is right ) may carry with it a lesser effect .. . at the moment , but it will never subject us to the misfortune of being doubted or discredited . Scrupulous attention to moderation in statement is one of the things which it is our constant effort to maintain in the daily news and editorial contents of The Bulletin . " Moderation may have been The Chief 's natural inclination , but it was also admirably suited to Philadelphia . Show people hate the town because it is so moderate  --  though they use harsher , nastier adjectives to describe a populace which " sits on its hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cities , if they possessed such a traditional and lovely spectacle as Philadelphia 's annual Mummers ' Parade , would hoopla and boost it all over the country . Philadelphia prefers to enjoy it quietly by itself , though if any outsider insists on coming , he is welcome . Even its City Hall politicians are moderate . Lincoln Steffens ' characterization of Philadelphia as " corrupt and contented " was misleading in one respect ; it is not very corrupt . Someone aptly has said that " Philadelphia is not a city ; it is a collection of villages . " The Chief phrased it more tactfully , but he realized that size alone does not make a big city . He understood that most Philadelphians , the dwellers in the row houses , do not think of themselves as living in a metropolis of 2,000,000 population , the third largest city in the land . They look upon themselves as inhabitants of , communities , of sections , which they call Kensington , Southwark , West Philadelphia , Tioga , Germantown , Frankford , Fishtown , Olney , Overbrook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Roxborough , Bustleton , Mt , Airy , Tacony , Manayunk , Eastwick . These are all within the city , with no apparent boundaries , but to most of the inhabitants the distinctions are very real . The truth of this observation is demonstrated frequently in a Bulletin department entitled  --  how typically ! ? Ethical Problems . This department , comprised almost entirely of letters from teen-agers begging other readers for advice on matters of social intercourse , is at once an acute finger on the pulse of the generation about to inherit Philadelphia , and one of the most touching and delightful columns in newspaperdom . For a long time , the major issues raging in it were whether West Philadelphia boys were more gentlemanly and " nicer fellows " than Southwark boys , whether Richmond girls were prettier than Frankford girls , and whether the younger set of Germantown were more " stuck-up " than those from other sections . The reality of // ( Cfmriaued teem Page 42 ) Some said he ought to have a medal , and one patriot coined a slogan : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Jap . " But mostly they demanded his blood . All of which is related by this reporter not jeeringly but with respect , even if there is no Thomas McMurtera . The Chief believed , and taught his sons , that what interests newspaper readers most is trivia concerning the Imps and mishaps of their neighbors ; the kind which could have happened to themselves . Before paper rationing , The Bulletin let not a sparrow fall unheeded in Philadelphia . Even now , there is always room on the front page for plenty of local news . Though traditionally Republican , The Bulletin has escaped damage from Philadelphia 's recent habit of going Democratic in national elections and coming close to it in local ones . This , too , is no accident . The Bulletin never hits its readers over the head with its political viewpoint . Some who knew The Chief quote him as saying , " When a reader buys my paper , he expects news , not advice on how to vote and what is right . " He had seen that the circulations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public opinion . Robert McLean , though a member of the rock-ribbed Union League , is registered as a nonpartisan . His charming wife , coming from the South , is a Democrat . This may have something to do with the fact that both parties usually get fairly equal treatment in the news columns . Editorially , The Bulletin has been so unsuccessful in picking candidates , even when it switched to the Democratic side in two purely local elections , that some wit has paraphrased its slogan thus : " Nearly Everybody Reads The Bulletin , but Nobody Pays Any Attention to It . " Robert McLean is not too disturbed by this , but he tells a story to rebut it . It concerns the days when the sheriff of Philadelphia County collected the fees of his office in lieu of a salary . These might run to $100,000 a year . Of course , under the rules of practical politics , he turned all above a reasonable sum into the chest of the party which put him in office . Some papers more militant than The Bulletin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Bulletin printed a four-line editorial saying in effect that it did n't seem quite right . A few days later , it ran another , similar in tone . The next day the sheriff came into the office . " Well , " he said , " I 'm licked . I never saw anything wrong with that system , but after your first editorial , my wife said to me : ' Are you sure you 're right ? The Bulletin does n't seem to like it . ' When your second editorial came out , my wife said to me , ' Look , you must be wrong . The Bulletin says so . ' " This almost indirect method , this avoidance of the open brawl , is typical of The Bulletin in all its dealings . When , in 1938 , the standard Philadelphia papers went to three cents , they suffered the inevitable drop in circulation . Two of the other papers countered this by offering free premiums to lure new subscribers . One of them put on the greatest premium drive in American newspaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in addition to prize contests and insurance policies . Both these Santa Clauses were morning papers , but a housewife offered a gleaming electric clock or a set of silverware may sometimes not worry overmuch whether it is a morning or evening paper she must buy to get the present . The Bulletin , eying its own circulation slump , did not Like the picture . Finally , it found a way to stop the spree . It went to the merchants of Philadelphia and pointed out to them that every premium meant the loss of a potential sale to their stores . It also intimated that unless the merchants put the heat on the other papers , The Bulletin would be forced  --  most regretfully , of course  --  to break its own taboo against premiums and put on the biggest jamboree of all time . That did it , and quickly . Similarly , when a morning newspaper began encroaching on The Bulletin 's time territory with earlier editions in the evening and later ones in the morning , in an effort to overhaul it as biggest paper in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It merely began shopping for comics and other features for a five-cent Sunday paper . Trade secrets are hard to keep in the newspaper business , and this one was extraordinarily badly BROKEN RULES ay VIRGINIA BRASIER kept . The Bulletin does not have a Sunday edition , and its entrance into this field , particularly at such a low price , could have raised hob with its morning competitor 's cherished Sunday circulation . The hint was enough . The competitor behaved . The Bulletin snapped out of its own circulation slump partly by the standard method of injecting new , top-notch blood into its organization . The Chief was gone and the men he had trained were getting old and unable to adjust his basic principles to the present . Perrin came in as managing editor , knocked some of the stuffiness out , and may yet be able to wangle a bit of sparkle into it . Whereas previously The Bulletin was considered a graveyard for newspaper writing talent , it now began to unleash some any paper might envy . There were , for example , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who had taught French at the University of Pennsylvania and conducted summer European tours before turning to a writing career . He was already well known as a free lance , having had several fiction stories printed in The Saturday Evening Post , when The Bulletin got him . There he writes a delightful column called Candid Shots , in which he manages subtly to spread caviar for sophisticated tastes on the selidthiad moat Philadelphians like . The other is Ralph W. Page , son of the late Walter Hines - Page , World War I diplomat . Page was running the family banking and orchard interests in North Carolina when Robert McLean met him and was intrigued by the clarity and calmness with which he expounded his pro-New Deal ideas in after-dinner conversation . These ideas were mostly counter to McLean 's , but McLean persuaded him to give up his business and start writing for The Bulletin . The result was that The Bulletin harbors in its arch-conservative bosom perhaps . the moat articulate and best-written liberal col- umn the country . Not only that , but it proudly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is known only to Bulletin readers . M. cLean will not permit either to be syndicated . Howard W. Stodghill ; hired away from a job as one of Hearst 's general managers , tightened up and streamlined the circulation department . Stodg- hill also brought The Bulletin * national by having boy newspaper carriers offer them for sale at subscribers ' front doors . Nearly 900 newspapers adopted the plan , which by last November had sold 1,286,707,636 stamps and started many families on bond purchases . George T. Eager , crack New York advertising-agency executive , was brought in as promotion director and trouble shooter . Richard W. Slocum , transformed from a successful Philadelphia lawyer to general manager of the paper , speaks the language of the newer generation of advertisers and businessmen . These men did not , however , take any real liberties with the basic formula that The Chief had handed down . It was Slocum , for instance , though personally a man of cultivated , sophisticated tastes , who discovered Charles J. Love , the Pigeon Man . That is as typical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done by The Chief himself . Love is a pigeon fancier , with a troupe of birds bearing such * names as Dopey , Happy , Grumpy and Speedy , and a knack for making pigeons fascinating to people who ordinarily would n't give a hoot . Today , Love and his birds appear by courtesy of The Bulletin and are wowing them at the rate of 30,000 a year . When the Pigeon Man shows up at a school , an assembly of all classes is called and the kids are popeyed with anticipation . The climax of his act begins when he announces that his pets are real homing pigeons , which can find their way , high and straight over the city , to their loft in The Bulle-tin " , Now , " says Love , " if you boys and girls will give me a secret message , we will see if this is true . " With much ex-citement and help from the teachers themselves fascinated , a committee is chosen to formulate a secret message . Another group is elected to stand by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ message to Speedy 's leg and tosses the bird out the window , " In six and one half minutes , " he predicts , " the telephone will ring and my assistant at The Bulletin will read the secret message over the telephone . " The tension gener-ated during those minutes is something any playwright would envy . And if the secret message , as is not infrequently the i case , is something like : " Tommy Jones loves Mary Smith , " the house is brought Continued on Page 46 ( Confirmed from Page 44 ) down . The total cost to The Bulletin is around $5000 a year . The payoff circulation-wise ? This writer 's six-year-old daughter came home from school one afternoon wide-eyed with excitement and spilling a tale of a HAVE WE MISSED THE BUS IN HOLLAND ? ( Continued from Page 10 ) " It is no good , " he said . " It wo n't work . " " But why not ? " the young fighter pilot wanted to know . " Who else could be put in charge until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Neither he nor any other loyal Dutchman thought you could hold elections the day after liberation , he said , nor until the Nazis had been expelled from every square mile of the Netherlands . After that , there must be a time of readjustment , no doubt . But in the meantime the people who had earned the right to leadership were the men who had been the spearhead of resistance , not old men who had gone away . " You can not accuse Western Holland 's underground leaders of being Communists , " he added crisply , " and so try to brand them unfit to lead . Almost to a man they are conservative and Catholic . " The most charitable conclusion Frans felt able to reach is that our Intelligence had not kept London and Washington properly informed . " If you reject this , " he said , " you are forced to believe that Roosevelt and Churchill do not want us to be free , but simply to put us back under our old political masters . " Somebody said he could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free elections as soon as possible ? " That is so , " the Hollander replied , " and the point is well made . But in the interval you should permit the men we want , not these old exiles , to direct our country 's affairs . That is what we had taken for granted would happen . These are the men who fought the Germans , who taught Dutchmen like me that we most fight . Now they are pushed aside , and we can not understand it . The Germans missed their opportunity . Are you going to miss yours ? " That was a big one . You could n't let that one go by without taking a cut at it . It was Blakely who asked , " Now what do you mean by that crack , Frans ? " " You will never know , " Frans said thoughtfully , " how near Europe came to accepting the Nazis as well as being overrun by them . They came promising freedom within the walls of a federation of European nations . Within the federation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affairs go . So would Belgium . So would everybody else . There was to be a central government to which each nation province would elect deputies in proportion to its population , and the central government would function only in matters relating to the common good . Customs barriers would be destroyed . We would become one big family , each branch running its own affairs , and this would happen as soon as our saviors had disposed of their archenemy across the , Channel . " Frans turned and spoke to the young flier . " If you will think of your own United States , " he said , " you will know what we were promised , the United States of Europe , and it would surprise you if you knew to how many Dutchmen the idea appealed , It did so partly because we had been taken unaware by the enemy , because our own political and military leaders had left us and we were ready to grasp any straw of hope . wonderful man with real live pigeons . " Daddy , ' , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me about the Pigeon Man . " That 's catching them a trifle young , but the odds are that she will be a devoted Bulletin reader , like her mother , when she grows up . But it still appeals to many of us as the only solution to the sickness of Europe . It is still a great idea . The only thing wrong with the 1940 presentation is that it came from the Nazis  --  and they did n't mean it . But we feel we must come to something like this , or Europe will uld come realizing this . But no. ypeonu.swholly the sword , and we believed You come bringing us the same men we had before , the same nationalisms , the same outlook , and you tell us we must accept this and the people who support the old order in Europe until you are able to supervise elections .

The old order will have strengthened its hold , here and elsebe almost impossible wherever you go in the liberated areas of Holland . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't solve it . I t is a problem which has confronted us wherever we have gone inEurope , a problem for which we brought no ready-made solution with us and to which we still have not found the right psychological approach . Trying to fob it off as left-wing agitation or worse is no help , either . Such thinking simply adds to our own confusion , and the charge is almost totally invalid in the case of the Dutch anyway . But a rough outline of the impact of events on the minds of ordinary Dutch citizens may explain their unease . The first item to be recorded is that nobody , excepting a few intransigeants , stood out against the Nazis in the beginning . Overwhelmingly , the defeated population opposed any activity likely to arouse German anger . The citizen 's first concern was for his family , as it would be in America under similar conditions . Hence the hothead minority  --  and there were n't enough Dutch hotheads to fill is two-gallon hat in 1940 ? were more cordially disliked and feared by their fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characters likely to get everybody into trouble , and about that time the bewildered , unarmed and cowed Dutch wanted no part of trouble with anybody . Moreover , they had been taken aback by the good behavior of the Wehrmacht , by the Germans ' assurances that their only enemy was England , whither they were reputedly en route through Holland . The Dutch were enamored , too , of the promise of a federated Europe , in which each member state would enjoy autonomy in domestic affairs . Certainly none of this was what they had expected from the invader . The only ammunition the light field batteries of the early resistance movement could fire against these strong points was " Never believe a German . " It did n't go down with the people . The early Dutch resisters had more to fear from their own people than from the Huns , who were so strongly entrenched they could afford to laugh off the feeble efforts of Dutch patriots .
