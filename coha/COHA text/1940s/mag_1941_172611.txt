The one eye President Roosevelt keeps on domestic affairs wore a worried look last week . Congress was bucking in harness . Congressmen were as frightened over price-control legislation as local businessmen in their States were smug over rising prices . Yet the need for control was apparent ; inflation was only a few hops &; skips and one big jump away ; already the defense program was costing the U.S. perhaps one-third more than necessary . <P> Defense was boggling along in a Sargasso Sea of red tape , internecine jealousies and an out- &-out; struggle for control , a struggle now at the stage of daggers-at-close-range between Leon Henderson 's OPACSters and the Knudsen OPMites ( see p. 64 ) . Publicly Franklin Roosevelt had scouted the idea that he wanted a single controlling head in charge of the entire defense effort ; privately he went on scouting for the right man . <P> He had only two present prospects : Under Secretary of War Robert Patterson , who was without industrial and financial background , and inclined to rigidity of mind , but active ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tough and fast but too skeptical of U.S. businessmen 's abilities , and who would not consider a top defense job unless he had absolute power to hire &; fire . The President , who loves to hire but hates to fire , dislikes giving his top officers such absolute power . <P> And problems continued to pile up on the President 's desk like a range of mountains . For months the President had delayed and stalled , trying to avoid asking Congress to extend indefinitely the draftees ' one-year term of service . When time began to close in on him , he still avoided direct personal leadership . Unwilling to buck the line himself , he sent in General George Marshall , Army Chief of Staff , to carry the ball and get the lumps . Good Soldier Marshall pounded down the field , through center , off-tackle , around the ends . The watching President could n't believe his eyes : there was , in fact , no real opposition . <P> Even such Isolationist ostriches as Ohio 's Senator Robert Taft admitted that there could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. Army . By now General Marshall had smashed all the way to the one-yard line . The President decided to go in himself , and carry the ball over for the touchdown . <P> But even as he prepared a message insisting on passage of the legislation , the other team walked off the field , defaulting the game : the little grey Kansas field mouse , Isolationist Alf M. Landon , came out for the bill . Then Franklin Roosevelt went in to make the touchdown . <P> He had put in a full week of arduous working days and brooding nights , even giving up a weekend in his beloved Hyde Park , to work on his draft-amendment message . Never before had he broadcast a message to Congress unless he delivered it in person , but this time he called the major broadcasting chains to the White House , had them record his speech for replaying as soon as his written message had gone to the Capitol .                    @
