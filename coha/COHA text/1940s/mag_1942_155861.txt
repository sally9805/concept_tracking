Adolf Hitler last week was face to face with an old European tradition : that a good way to lose a war is to attack Russia . In 3,000 carefully chosen , sense-making words , appearing last week in the Man chester Guardian , sagacious old Eduard Benes , President of the Czecho-Slovak Government-in-Exile , told why : <P> In my view , the attack on the Soviet Union was a mad action-the action of a criminal who is driven by fate always to make good the effects of his first crime by a second crime and then by further crimes until the final catastrophe . . . . <P> A year ago last week , flushed with an impressive string of whirlwind victories , Adolf Hitler trumpeted that " the year . . . will bring completion of the greatest victory in our history . " <P> Adolf Hitler last week gave a New Year promise that was hedged with conditions , panic and piety : <P> " We can ask of the Almighty that He give to the German people and to its soldiers the strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberties and our future . . . . The year 1942-and we pray to God , all of us , that it may-should bring the decision which will save our people and with them our allied nations . " <P> Last week German forces were in full retreat along the entire Russian front ( see p. 25 ) . In London , a British military commentator , declaring that " the German Air Force is literally worn out , " estimated Luftwaffe strength as 35% less than it was when London was first attacked with fire bombs a year ago . Credit for that claimed destruction is shared by the R.A.F. and Russia . From Sweden , for whatever reason , came increasingly pessimistic reports about Germany . <P> I am now inclined to expect from Hitler desperate , nervous , furious and fanatical , and thus ill-advised military and political actions , and therefore it is necessary to be on our guard in every way , in both the political and military spheres . . . . <P> Last week , Stockholm reported Adolf Hitler had quit his Berchtesgaden hide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ command and starch the spines of his very weary warriors with an inspiring personal appearance . The obvious question-what can Germany do now ? - had its usual gossip-born answers : a German turn to the south in an all-out effort to rid the Mediterranean of British power and avenge the Libyan defeats ; a German move against Turkey ; German occupation of Spain , Portugal , an attack against Gibraltar ; German assumption of the French Fleet , occupation of Dakar . <P> Field Marshal von Brauchitsch admitted in a military consultation at the end of November , that Germany must realize in both the military and political fields that she could no longer win the war ; it was possible , he said , that she might not entirely and necessarily lose the peace , if the Germans were helped by the political and diplomatic errors of the Anglo-Saxons . <P> Where Field Marshal Walther von Brauchitsch was last week neither Eduard Benes nor any other Allied strategist knew for sure , but they pondered reports that many another German general was in disgrace . <P> But most of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marshal von Brauchitsch : what mistakes must the Allies make to save the German Reich from disaster ?
