June 1940 . The garden outside DENISE 'S chateau . A tree with circular bench at center . Garden furniture at left . Stage Right is dimly lighted . FERDINAND sprawls on a bench . DENISE is sitting and shelling peas . DENISE Oh dear I am so tired of working I wish I could be rich again , oh dear . I want to be rich , anyway I never want to shell a pea or dig a potato or wash a dress . I want all vegetables to grow in cans not in the ground . I want all clothes washed in a laundry and I want all stockings bought new and thrown away . That is what I want , oh dear . Ferdinand , when Henry and I were first married and he was in the army , oh it was wonderful and now he just does nothing , for Heaven 's sake ca n't you make him earn something and help us . Ferdinand just do n't stand there , take my side , make your brother Henry do something , I love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my husband but you can influence him . Ferdinand why do n't you take my side , Ferdinand , why do n't you take my side ? FERDINAND Denise , I do take your side , I do , I do take your side , I take everybody 's side . Do n't keep at me , you make me cry , I know you 're miserable . I take everybody 's side , that is the way I am , I do take everybody 's side . p. 3 DENISE Do n't cry , Ferdinand , no Ferdinand do n't cry , no do n't cry , but I am not everybody . I am just me , why do n't you take my side . FERDINAND ( FERDINAND crosses away angrily ) My God , Denise , everybody 's side , no you are right , Denise , I do n't take anybody 's side , of course I do n't take anybody 's side , of course I do n't take anybody 's side . My God look at us , here we are , can you take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are all in prison , every Frenchman is in prison , no you are right , Denise , I do not take anybody 's side , how I want , how I do want to take everybody 's side , but you ca n't take sides in prison , every Frenchman in France is in prison , but you ca n't take sides in prison , that is what prison is . Go away , Denise , I ca n't take anybody 's side . ( FERDINAND sits hopelessly on bench at the tree ) DENISE ( Following FERDINAND pleading ) Do n't cry , Ferdinand , you said you do n't cry but you do cry , Ferdinand , why do you cry like that ? It 's silly to say we are in prison , just take my side , talk to Henry . You know I love Henry . You just be sensible and talk sense . I know what is the matter with you , it 's that American Constance , she likes you to talk like that , but you frighten me when you talk like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Constance likes you to talk like that , it makes her feel , well you know what I mean . ( Goes back to shelling peas ) I like you to cry , Ferdinand , but I like you to take my side , and remember you belong to me . You are Henry 's brother and you belong to me , and you should talk to him about earning money and making me comfortable , Ferdinand . You will always take my side , tell me you will . p. 4 FERDINAND Denise , ca n't you see , ca n't you feel , this is no time to talk about anything but what has happened to France . Denise , ca n't you see . DENISE Oh Ferdinand , you just talk and talk , Constance , she is American and she likes you to talk , but if Henry does not work and earn money , he will sulk , he wo n't talk to me for days , he 'll just sulk , Ferdinand , you just have to make him earn money , you just have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not talking to me for days . I just wo n't . FERDINAND ( Crosses to DENISE solemnly ) Denise , as surely as France will be free , as surely as France will come back , as surely as someday we will be Free , so surely will Henry do what he has to do , he will not do what you want him to do . DENISE You are nothing but a boy , Ferdinand , why should I listen to you , just a boy . What does Henry talk to Constance about , they talk all the time . Oh dear , I wish Henry would not sulk . I wish he would be like my brother Achille . Oh , how I wish he would be handsome the way he is and not sulk , he is handsome but how he sulks . Ferdinand , be on my side , make him work , he never sulked when he was in the army , he used to come home with Achille , and we were all so happy . Ferdinand , be on my side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be so long . Denise , every day is going to be so long , in a defeat , the days are short and the weeks are long and the year , oh the year , once it is over , but is a year over really over , a whole year , a whole year of defeat , it is all so long . ( He crosses away ) p. 5 DENISE Henry is just going back to his old ordinary life . FERDINAND ( Dropping down on the bench ) He is not , nobody is going back to his old ordinary life . DENISE He is . FERDINAND He is not . ( HENRY comes in , he throws himself down under the trees , he turns toward FERDINAND ) HENRY Have you seen the Armistice notice ? FERDINAND No , I could n't look . HENRY I looked , there it was , on the barn , all day yesterday . The rain was coming down , a group of farmers were standing there reading the notice , they did n't say anything , it rained , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was , it was raining nobody was reading it , nobody , and it was raining and then I saw two of them standing there , and they said , France needs discipline , and then two others stood and read it , and the old one said he could n't believe it , I heard one old one say , No I do n't believe it , no I do n't , I do n't believe it , and I heard his son say , come along old man , of course you can believe it . Well , said the young one , for my generation there is nothing to believe , but your generation , of course you can believe it . And it just kept on raining and the notice of the Armistice was there on the barn . Oh my God , and it got darker and it rained and it was there , and then I heard Achille , yes your brother , Denise , say that there was going to be an army . My God an army , my God , Marshal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My God , not a French army , Marshal Petain 's Army . My God . p. 6 DENISE ( Still shelling peas ) Achille said that . You listen to me , Henry . Oh dear I am so tired of working , I wish I could be rich . Listen to me , Henry , why do n't you join the army like Achille , why do n't you ? Oh dear , oh dear , why wo n't you ? For Heaven 's sake , do n't lie there sulking . Well I want to be comfortable even if you do n't , and the only way for you to earn something is to go back to the army . Look at Achille , he has gone back to the army and my brother knows best about everything . Why do n't you do what he does , join Marshal Petain 's army . HENRY Marshal Petain 's army , Marshal Petain 's army , I would just as leave vomit as join Marshal Petain 's army . You make me sick with your Achille , Achille @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you remember , you make me sick , ca n't you remember that while Marshal Petain is forming that miserable little army of one hundred and twenty-five thousand men , that miserable little toy army , my two brothers are rotting in prison in Germany with two million of your fellow countrymen , if you ca n't remember my brothers you can remember them . Achille , Achille , Achille , you make me sick . ( Lifts himself up to sitting position ) DENISE Do n't you dare , do n't you dare say anything against Achille , did n't he bring down six of the enemy 's airplanes , did n't he , and you never did , he did . p. 7 HENRY Yes and now he has forgotten who those enemies are , yes he has , and he licks their boots and he wants them to win . Pah , you all make me sick . ( He lies back and looks up at the trees ) DENISE If I were not married to you Henry , I would never forgive you . ( And her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A Young Woman in white comes on the terrace ) DENISE Oh Constance . Come I am so miserable . CONSTANCE ( Joining DENISE ) What is it , is it the peas ? DENISE Yes , it is always peas , it is always peas , but now there is the only way I could get away from peas and Henry wo n't , he wo n't , he wo n't . CONSTANCE Henry wo n't what ? DENISE He wo n't join the army and if he did he would earn enough and I would only have to shell his peas and my peas , not everybody 's peas . Oh it is just too miserable of him . Ferdinand , you always take my part , should n't he join the army , should n't he . Achille has . CONSTANCE ( Sitting beside DENISE ) Oh Achille. p. 8 DENISE Oh you are an American and you do not understand , Achille knows  --  CONSTANCE My dear , American or not , I do know that Achille , he is nice , he is sweet , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down five airplanes all by himself . HENRY Six ! DENISE Six . CONSTANCE Yes I know , of course and he is so modest he never mentions it and he does not wear his decorations , but everybody does know about those six planes . DENISE You are horrid and American , American and horrid . Ferdinand , say something , you always understand , say something . FERDINAND Yes , sure I understand you and Achille too , but I understand Henry too . Oh nonsense , there is no sense to it , I am not like some , I do think the Marshal has helped France by making his armistice , but an armistice is not peace , it is a truce and as long as there is no peace we are at war with Germany even if we are not fighting and an army is just silly , an army that is not supposed at any time to fight against Germany . It is just silly . No , Henry is right , he should not join a silly army like that . HENRY ( Looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be an army under the Marshal who lets our two brothers rot in prison in Germany while he makes a toy army that can never fight for them . Oh , let everybody shut up , let everybody shut up , shut up , shut up . p. 9 DENISE ( Going to HENRY ) I wo n't shut up , I wo n't , Achille  --  CONSTANCE Oh for Heaven 's sake , quote your mother or your uncle or your father , if it has to be in the family but not always Achille , besides he is too modest to speak , of course he is . DENISE Do n't you dare talk like that , Constance . Well if you want that I quote my mother , she says well she does not say she wants Germany to win but she says Germany will win , and when they do a noble family like ours that has always owned land in France will once more rule over France and teach everybody what discipline is . HENRY Yes , discipline , you ca n't do a day 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and all your ground gets less and less productive . Bah , aristocrats make me sick , everything makes me sick , everything . ( HENRY and DENISE go off quarreling into the house . FERDINAND lying at her feet and looking up at CONSTANCE who is seated in a chair ) CONSTANCE Denise is very lovely . FERDINAND Yes . CONSTANCE And Henry really loves her . FERDINAND Yes . p. 10 CONSTANCE And she loves Henry . FERDINAND Yes . CONSTANCE And you , Ferdinand ? FERDINAND Yes . CONSTANCE Yes can be said too often . FERDINAND Yes . CONSTANCE ( Walking away from him ) It is all just commencing , everything is just commencing . FERDINAND Yes . CONSTANCE Oh Ferdinand , do n't be stupid and annoying . FERDINAND ( Following her ) Constance , Constance , what can I say , what is there to say but yes , no does not mean anything , no not now , but yes , yes means something . Oh my God , yes means you , it means you , yes it does , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yes , yes , yes . CONSTANCE ( Very slowly ) Yes , yes is for a very young man , and you Ferdinand , you are a very young boy , yes you are , yes is for a very young one , a very young man , but I am not so young , no I am not , and so I say no . I always say no . You know , Ferdinand , yes you know that I always say no. p. 11 FERDINAND Yes . ( Silence ) CONSTANCE And life now , Ferdinand , is it yes . FERDINAND It is yes to me . CONSTANCE Yes and it is no to me . I love to think of you as yes , FERDINAND You should love to think of me as no . FERDINAND Do n't be like an enemy , Constance , do n't be like a cruel enemy , a cruel enemy who always says no , cruelly no , until at last he says yes and that is death . Do not , Constance , do not say no , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say yes first , say yes , Constance , you must say yes . CONSTANCE My poor Ferdinand , even if I said yes , it would be no , it must be no , my poor Ferdinand , it is all just commencing and you know , how well you must know that it must commence with no , and go on with no and end with no , my poor Ferdinand , it must be so . FERDINAND Yes . CONSTANCE Yes , Ferdinand , it must be no . FERDINAND There is no difference between defeat and victory then . CONSTANCE There is none now certainly not now . Ferdinand , Ferdinand , no there is no difference between defeat and victory , not yet , wait , Ferdinand , it will always be no , but wait , Ferdinand , wait . p. 12 FERDINAND Yes . CONSTANCE Henry does love Denise . FERDINAND Yes . CONSTANCE Denise does love Henry . FERDINAND Does she ? CONSTANCE ( Turning from him ) Yes , Ferdinand , she does . FERDINAND And you , Constance , whom do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? FERDINAND ( Goes to her ) You love me . CONSTANCE Do I love you ? FERDINAND Yes . CONSTANCE No Ferdinand , it is easy to say no , Ferdinand , we must , we must , there is no love , Ferdinand . There is no love , we must , there is no love , you know it , and never , never forget it , there is no love , no , no , no , never forget it , there is no love , there is so much , there is no love , Ferdinand . ( He takes her in his arms ) No , no , no , there is no love . Ferdinand , you do know it , you know there is no love . FERDINAND Yes . ( As DENISE comes down the stairs with sewing basket , FERDINAND goes out of the gate . DENISE comes over to CONSTANCE , seated ) p. 13 DENISE Oh are you all alone , Constance ? CONSTANCE Yes , one has to be alone sometime . DENISE All right , I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that is the nicest way of being alone , you know it is , being alone together . CONSTANCE Yes , of course you silly , come and let us be alone together . Come and sit down and let 's talk . DENISE ( Sits , mending sock ) Oh I am so tired , all this fuss and trouble , and oh dear , I ought to be taking potato bugs off the potato plants . My mother has taken my father off to do that . Well , I suppose my mother was wise , she , well , they started rich and after the last war they became poor , so poor they have to take their own potato bugs off their potato plants . I often wonder ( Giggling ) whether mother did it just to keep father being always with her . You know , Constance , in their society , father would not have been faithful but , dear me , ( Giggling ) if they have to work on the farm together , and mother is always there , what can he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your mother is really poor ? DENISE What do you mean , Constance ? p. 14 CONSTANCE Well , I do often think that your mother has hidden away enough , largely enough , it would be like her to do it , so your father would have to search for potato bugs with her , and ( Dreamily ) nobody would know but Achille and he would forget and in all that disorder , perhaps it is all lost forever , but anyway , anyway , what does it matter . DENISE Of course you are crazy , Constance , you always are crazy , of course it would matter . Someday I am going to have a little girl , Ferdinand would so love to have me have a little girl , and Henry would so love to have me have a little girl , a baby girl , Henry and Ferdinand , Ferdinand and Henry , they would so love to have me have a little girl . Whom do you think it would look like when I had my little girl , Constance . Would it look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . CONSTANCE ( Nastily ) Perhaps it would look like Achille and your mother . You never can tell . ( Moves away laughing ) But are you going to have a baby , Denise ? DENISE Perhaps yes , perhaps no , how can I have anything with a husband like Henry who wo n't join the army . Tell me , Constance , what are American men like , you never talk about them , what are they like , tell me , Constance . p. 15 CONSTANCE What are they like , well I suppose men are always alike . DENISE No they are not , you know they are not , no . Why wo n't you tell what American men are like . I ca n't marry one because I am married to Henry , but I have cousins , perhaps they might like to marry one . Tell me , Constance , do they take good care of their women . CONSTANCE Do they , they certainly do , they take care of them magnificently , they give them everything they want . DENISE Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not like Henry . Oh how nice , and Constance , are they attractive and passionate like our men . Tell me , Constance , are they ? CONSTANCE ( Dreamily ) Are they , no perhaps not , perhaps they ask less and they give more , perhaps they do , why do you want to know about American men , why do you ask , you are not interested , why do you ask ? DENISE ( Following CONSTANCE ) Not because I want to surprise all your secrets , Constance , all or any . Have you any secrets , Constance ? Tell me about American men , I want to know so that my cousin can marry one of them . Oh dear , perhaps Ferdinand is right . Perhaps we are in prison . Oh dear , we used to have so many people come visiting , so many coming and going and now could one come or could she go to him ? Oh dear , perhaps Ferdinand is right , but no , Ferdinand is not right . One stranger is like another stranger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strangers do not trouble a Frenchwoman or a Frenchman , not any stranger , do you think they do , Constance ? Tell me about American men . Do you like them better than Frenchmen , than my Frenchman , tell me Constance ? ( And then interrupting herself ) Listen , an airplane , listen . ( She screams ) Oh Henry , listen , an airplane , I am sure it is Achille. p. 16 HENRY ( At upper window ) Stop your screaming , stop it , it 's a Boche airplane , stop it , even Achille would not drive a Boche airplane , shut up . DENISE Come down , Henry , come down . Constance is telling me all about American men , come down Henry . HENRY ( Closing the window with a bang ) Oh , shut up . DENISE You see , Constance , you see , I am right , we French people are not interested in strangers . But tell me , tell me about American men , if Henry was an American man would he not work to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about so much , tell me Constance . ( FERDINAND coming up behind silently , stands a moment and then says ) FERDINAND Are there any American men , Constance , were there any American men and did you love them ? ( Silence . The roar of German tanks passing the road below , they listen ) DENISE Did you see the Godets , Ferdinand ? FERDINAND No they are gone . DENISE Gone where ? FERDINAND Gone where , gone when , when , where , that is what one asks , where can anybody go , go where , My God , go where , all France is on the way , they do n't know where they are going and are they on their way . My God , go where . p. 17 CONSTANCE Yes I too was about to go , to go not somewhere but anywhere and one of my neighbors , a farmer said to me , Mademoiselle , go where , I am an old man and I tell you in time of danger stay where you are , there if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are there , if you live through it you are still there , there where you are . Mademoiselle in time of danger stay where you are , trying to go away from danger is useless , stay where you are , mademoiselle , in time of danger stay where you are . I stayed . DENISE ( Bitterly ) Yes you stayed . FERDINAND ( Softly ) You stayed . CONSTANCE Yes , I stayed . ( Silence . Once more on the road below the German tanks are passing ) DENISE American men do everything for their women , they earn a lot of money and their wives spend it , that is what Constance says . Oh Henry ( She calls out ) come down quickly , listen to what Constance says . HENRY ( Coming in quickly carrying one shoe ) What is it , Constance . DENISE She says that American men earn lots of money and that their wives spend it , that is what she says . Listen to what she says , Henry , you love to listen to what she says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HENRY ( Putting on sock , DENISE has been mending ) Oh hell , you make me tired . DENISE But listen , Henry , listen . All you would have to do would be to join the army like Achille and you would earn enough , not like those American men Constance admires so much but enough , listen , Henry , listen . HENRY Yes , listen , listen . ( They listen as the tanks pass on below ) ( Bitterly ) Yes , listen , you make me sick , yes listen , listen , listen . ( He turns away and DENISE follows him still talking . FERDINAND and CONSTANCE are left alone ) FERDINAND ( Listening to the tanks ) Yes listen , it is all so unreal , Constance , is it unreal to you , it seems less unreal to you than it is to me , to us , is it because you are more practical . After all you are American , is it all more real to you than to us , to us it is horrible but not real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and therefore not so horrible . Is it , Constance ? And American men , Constance , are there American men , Constance , are there , is Denise right , are there ? CONSTANCE ( Goes to him ) Tell me about Frenchmen , Ferdinand , tell me about France . p. 19 FERDINAND ( Turning from her ) You wo n't let me tell you about myself and yourself but you want me to tell you about Frenchmen and France . CONSTANCE Yes . FERDINAND There I have made you say yes . CONSTANCE Did you think that you had deprived me of that pleasant word forever ? FERDINAND Sometimes I almost had hoped so . CONSTANCE What do you mean , Ferdinand . FERDINAND I mean that if I was strong enough to stop your saying yes completely and forever then I was strong enough to eventually make you say yes completely and forever . ( FERDINAND embraces her ) CONSTANCE ( Breaking away ) Silly boy , tell me , yes , tell me about France and Frenchmen , tell me what Frenchmen are , what France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beaten but not conquered , that can be a phoenix and rise from the ashes . Yes , that is France , it always has it always will , it likes to change , it has had so many governments , sometimes it is bitter fun to count them , but what are governments , a government should leave civilians alone , protect them from their enemies and not cost too much , when they ca n't protect them from their enemies , then there has to be another government , and oh dear , were we not protected or were our enemies too strong , Constance . I think so much , Constance , do say yes , protect me from my enemies , that is the enemies within , those without , I will do all I can , believe me. p. 20 CONSTANCE ( Sits on bench drawing him down beside her ) Yes I believe you but tell me tell me what are Frenchmen like , you are only a boy but tell me what are Frenchmen like . FERDINAND Frenchmen , what are Frenchmen like , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not , they are lovers and they are not obedient . CONSTANCE But I like men to be obedient . FERDINAND Obedience is a curse . That is what makes Germans and you wait , Constance , your country will find out , obedience makes people predatory . The Germans are obedient and obedient people must sooner or later follow a bad leader , that is what the Germans do but we French , we are not obedient . We love but we are not obedient . Constance , say yes , say you do love me . CONSTANCE Silly boy , tell me some more about what Frenchmen are . You are only a boy but do tell me some more what Frenchmen are . FERDINAND ( Gets up angrily ) Frenchmen are Frenchmen and France is full of Frenchmen . Just wait it may be a long wait , defeat is long , so long , but France is full of Frenchmen say yes and wait . ( Just then DENISE and HENRY come down . DENISE calls out ) p. 21 DENISE Henry is coming with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want to come too , Ferdinand . Constance is too daintily dressed , but come along , do come along , see Henry help me get potato bugs off the potato plants . HENRY ( Sticking out his foot ) These shoes will never crush to death a potato bug upon a potato plant so long as one Boche remains uncrushed on the soil of France . DENISE Do n't be silly , Henry , we have to eat potatoes whether the Germans are here or are not here . You are just being silly , earning a living and killing potato bugs just has to go on . You are just being silly , Henry , come along . ( They go off ) CONSTANCE Is this a beginning , Ferdinand ? FERDINAND Do n't be silly , Constance , Henry loves Denise , he is a Frenchman , he is not obedient . Do n't be silly , Constance . You pay attention to me , do n't be silly , Constance . I am your lover , do n't you know what I am , I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , I am not obedient , I am your lover . CONSTANCE Yes , Ferdinand , how old are you , why Ferdinand , you are at that stage when your food card gives you the right to have cigarettes and chocolate . Just think , if you are not twenty-one , you can eat chocolate , and if you are over eighteen you can smoke cigarettes , and you are just those silly years when you can smoke cigarettes and eat chocolate at the same time , but you ca n't smoke cigarettes and eat chocolate and love at the same time and be a man at the same time and have me say no and yes at the same time , you want too much , Ferdinand , you want too much . Be a boy , Ferdinand , be a boy , I want you to be a boy . ( Silence . Below the tanks are rumbling . HENRY comes bursting in ) p. 22 HENRY My hat , that woman , potato bugs , that woman . CONSTANCE What woman , Henry . HENRY Denise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potato bugs . She 'll drive me crazy . CONSTANCE What has she done ? HENRY ( Pacing furiously ) Done , nothing but talk , but how she talks and what she says . In between potato bugs she talks about how now that France is organized very soon the working people will have to work for what their employers agree to give them . And what will they agree to give them ? Well , I can tell you if my cherished mother-in-law has anything to say about it they wo n't give them anything . I told her what she calls work is just amateurish make-believe , that she never finished anything , that nothing grew , that the potato bugs flourished and she said that I knew nothing about discipline but when I did  --  ( DENISE comes charging in ) DENISE Henry , how dare you talk like that to my mother ? HENRY I tell you all here and now , now and here , solemnly I tell you , if I ever again hear a Frenchman or a Frenchwoman pronounce that word discipline I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother , Denise , your poor father and Achille have never heard the word . Discipline , how I hate that word , that is the word that all retired government employees use , all retired officers use , discipline , they who never had to fight the battle of life , they who have a sure job and then a pension , they who never had to struggle , discipline , pah , discipline . p. 23 DENISE Well , where is the struggle you 're making , where is the money you are earning . Discipline that is what you need , go back to the army and get discipline , like Achille , my mother is right . HENRY Bah , it is the unsuccessful people in the world who want to discipline everybody . DENISE Well are you so successful , would you eat any potatoes if they were not yours , would you ? HENRY Perhaps yes , perhaps no , who can tell , who can tell , come along . Denise , come along . ( They go into the house ) FERDINAND Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And you , Constance , what are you going to do ? ( Sound of tanks below ) CONSTANCE What am I going to do , what can I do , I am going to stay . ( She sits , listening ) FERDINAND Stay here ? CONSTANCE Yes , stay here . FERDINAND Stay here in France ? CONSTANCE Yes stay here in France . Yes Ferdinand stay here in France . Here in France where I have had so many pleasant days . ( Rumble of the tanks grows louder , then fades ) Now when the days will not be so pleasant , what else could I do , I could not not stay in France . p. 24 FERDINAND ( Coming to her ) Does that mean more than you say ? CONSTANCE That means all that I say , and that means that I stay , stay here , stay in France . FERDINAND ( Kneeling beside her ) And I will be here too . CONSTANCE My poor boy will you ? FERDINAND If you stay I will stay . CONSTANCE My poor boy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps neither of us will stay . Well , anyway , I will begin and stay and you will stay too . Be quiet , Ferdinand  --  ( FERDINAND buries his head in her lap ) always quiet , until there is no more quiet , no more quiet , no , no more quiet , Ferdinand . Curtain p. 25 Act 1 , Scene 2 ACT ONE Scene 2 CONSTANCE 'S park two years later . Lights come up on stage right . A rustic bench , tree stumps , etc . CONSTANCE is alone , as OLYMPE enters . OLYMPE ( Covering her face with her apron ) Mademoiselle , mademoiselle . CONSTANCE What is it , Olympe , what is it ? OLYMPE Oh , Mademoiselle , there I was sitting quietly in my kitchen and cleaning the vegetables , poor Mademoiselle , I can not cook much but vegetables but I had the sauce left over from the rabbit and that would make the spinach tasty , and I have not told Mademoiselle , it was to be a surprise but Clothilde found an egg . CONSTANCE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ egg and I was cutting it up to garnish the spinach indeed I was cutting it up very fine to make it look more than one egg , the poor Mademoiselle , and there I saw passing the window a Boche , a Boche . Oh , Mademoiselle , oh , Mademoiselle , I never thought to see one of them in my kitchen again , after they went two years ago , after the armistice , and we were the free zone , not so free but still no Boche in my kitchen , but I should have known , Mademoiselle , I should have known . Never once without twice , I should have known , Mademoiselle . ( She sits on tree stump ) p. 26 CONSTANCE Olympe , what does he want ? OLYMPE What does he want , Mademoiselle , he wants to steal murder burn , but above all steal , Mademoiselle , he wanted to have some keys . CONSTANCE What keys ? OLYMPE What keys , Mademoiselle , I was very dignified , I never showed anything of all I felt , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any keys he wishes , but what keys . And just then my sister Clothilde came in , and I came out to warm Mademoiselle . No , Mademoiselle , I should have known never once without twice and Mademoiselle , Mademoiselle , never twice without thrice , we will have them once again , once again , after this and then if we are not all dead it will be all over . Oh , Mademoiselle , Mademoiselle . CONSTANCE But Olympe . CLOTHILDE ( Enters calling ) Mademoiselle , Mademoiselle , they are gone , this time they are gone . CONSTANCE For Heaven 's sake , Clothilde , for Heaven 's sake , what 's happened . CLOTHILDE You see , Mademoiselle , I said to the Boche capitain , what does Monsieur le Capitain desire , and he said he wanted the keys of the gate of the park , and I said certainly , Monsieur , certainly , and he said who lives here , and I said Madame lives here , she is a relation of the old gentleman , Monsieur de Thuys , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I replied that unfortunately , and Madame would most certainly regret it exceedingly , but Madame was occupied at the moment and would therefore be unable to see Monsieur le Capitaine , but if Monsieur le Capitain would have the kindness to return in an hour Madame would undoubtedly then be able to receive him . p. 27 CONSTANCE My gracious and what did he say ? CLOTHILDE He said it was of no importance , he only wished to have the key of the park gate , so that the soldiers could camp there in case of bombardment by the English and Americans while they were passing through the village . CONSTANCE My gracious and what did you say Clothilde . CLOTHILDE I said that Madame would undoubtedly accede to his request and that indeed I could take it upon myself to give him the keys without disturbing Madame , which indeed I was quite certain he would not desire .

I did not tell you but Christian and I went up the mountain to have a look at the maquis . Well , I do n't know , it is pretty bad , they are a pretty lawless lot , gutter snipes you know .

CONSTANCE But Denise you knew what their opinions were before you went . DENISE Yes , of course I did , but opinions , well one has to be patient and they are Henry 's family but to call , a priest to call Marshal Petain a cretin . ( HENRY enters bursting with laughter ) HENRY Hel-o-o-o everybody . Oh there you are Denise , there you are . Your pig is dead . ( He sits on a stump ) DENISE Pig , our Pig is dead . HENRY Yes , your pig is dead . Now that the miserable little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and one of your rabbits died of some kind of rabbit disease and Achille thought that the pig would like it , rabbit disease and all , and he fed it to the pig and the pig is dead , that 's all the pig is dead . p. 31 DENISE You beast , if you were not my husband and going to be the father of my child , I would kill you .

Yes Denise keeps on saying it but there is something in it , my poor Constance . You do n't understand . How can you understand , no Constance , you do not understand . ( Coming down to her ) There are so many points of view in a Frenchman , of course he can not agree with any other Frenchman but he can not even agree with himself inside him that is to say with the other Frenchman which is him . No my poor Constance you do not understand . p. 32 CONSTANCE But Henry .

CONSTANCE ( Bitterly . ) ( Crossing away ) You are as bad as Denise and Achille . FERDINAND Perhaps , but I had better go . CONSTANCE ( To herself ) How can I go on with Henry , how can I , how can I go on .

I am just going to Germany because all of my age have to go and there is nothing else to do . p. 33 CONSTANCE ( Sits desperately on bench ) No , I do n't understand , Denise is right , I do n't understand . FERDINAND When our class is called we go , all men are like that , you Americans never did that , but from the time we are born we Frenchmen know the day and the hour that we have to go to be a soldier , we call ourselves a class and when we are babies we know we belong to a class that is called by the date of the year when we come to be twenty . And then we must go . CONSTANCE But Ferdinand you are not going to fight , you say you are not going to fight . FERDINAND No not to fight , to persist to exist , but not to fight , no , not to fight . CONSTANCE Well then why do you go ?

CONSTANCE But your father and mother could not want you to go you are only a boy Ferdinand , boys can not endure what you will have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not boys , surely your father and your mother would not want you to go . FERDINAND My dear , my dear , I am not a boy , at most I am a very young man , and a very young man is not a boy , perhaps a very young man is old enough to love and live , to go away and to come backagain , perhaps Constance perhaps , yes Constance yes I must go and not stay . ( He starts to go ) Yes Constance , you will stay and not I , I will go away . CONSTANCE No I do n't understand . I do n't understand . Denise is right I do n't understand .

CONSTANCE ( Startled ) Of course he has gone to Germany . ( Dreamily ) He was going to be homesick for us all , us all , of course he has gone to Germany . DENISE I look at you Constance and I do n't know , has he gone to Germany . Henry he wo n't say , and you , you say , has he gone to Germany . CONSTANCE Well of course he has gone to Germany , if he has not gone to Germany where could he go . DENISE The terrorists . CONSTANCE But he said . DENISE Yes I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't believe you , what do I know what you know about terrorists what do I know . I believe him but what is the use of believing him when ( She screams ) Henry , he has gone to Germany he is not with the terrorists . p. 39 HENRY Oh shut up .

CONSTANCE Oh Georges , there you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workman and a farmer , you do n't know which , most anywhere a workman is a workman and a farmer is a farmer but you , how can I tell are you a workman today or a farmer ? POUPET I guess Mademoiselle , I am just a Frenchman . CONSTANCE Listen , Georges , what was that funny kind of a train I just saw passing ? POUPET Funny , well yes , it looks like a small boy 's idea of a train . CONSTANCE It looks like a teapot with that funny cover on it . POUPET Well I guess it can bust almost as easily as a teapot if it comes to a try . CONSTANCE But is it , it , Georges ? POUPET Yes it is , Mademoiselle , it is it , it is. p. 41 CONSTANCE And Monsieur Henry has he told you to tell me anything ? POUPET Do n't you ever be in a hurry , Mademoiselle .

( GEORGES moves away along the track . DENISE comes in ) DENISE Constance . CONSTANCE ( Turning ) Hello Denise , what are you doing here , your father and mother and Achille took the last train . Where were you ? DENISE Oh Constance I was so busy I had to find someone to take care of little Christine , oh she is so sweet the baby is such a darling , and she does , yes she does , she looks exactly like Ferdinand .

CONSTANCE No regular funeral . DENISE No of course not , poor cousin William , they did not know which bones were which and it would have been awful to bury the bones of one of those terrorists instead of poor dear young cousin William 's . CONSTANCE What do you mean Denise ? DENISE Well you know that cousin Etienne was killed , that is almost six months ago and he had a proper funeral , he was killed at home . CONSTANCE Yes of course , you all went to the funeral . DENISE Yes poor dear cousin Etienne , he was killed because his brother William was doing his duty as a militian . CONSTANCE But if Etienne was not a militian . DENISE Yes but they were looking for him for William , two men who had quarreled , with him , about some black market , I do n't know just what and poor dear cousin Etienne was standing at the window of their chateau and he told the terrorists what he thought of them and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funeral . They found among his papers one that said that he knew he was the least intelligent of his brothers and he could only be of use staying home and farming and perhaps being killed for one of them and he was , and his mother was so sure now that dear cousin Etienne was in heaven , he could intercede for his brothers and they would none of them be killed , and now poor cousin William who was burning a farm where those wicked terrorists were defending themselves was killed and fell into the flames and was burned up with them , and now poor dear William he can only have a mass he can not have a funeral . Poor dear young cousin William . p. 43 CONSTANCE A Frenchman killing Frenchmen , how can you Denise , how can you talk like that , how can you ? DENISE But Constance you do not understand , they are not Frenchmen , they are terrorists and it is the duty of real Frenchmen like my cousin . It is their duty , their duty , their duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every Frenchman who feels it is his duty to kill Frenchmen will end like your cousin William . DENISE Oh you and Henry and Henry 's family who call Marshal Petain a cretin , you do n't know what it is to do your duty , you do n't you do n't , you do n't .

HENRY I aimed to miss her . CONSTANCE Yes she was all full of how the militians do their duty . p. 44 HENRY Yes I know , but this time it is not Achille , no Achille is Achille , and I went to school with him and he was always Achille , but even he knows better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mother , you know she is the direct descendant of the family of Joan of Arc . CONSTANCE Joan of Arc ? HENRY Well , yes I think it was Joan of Arc , it was somebody like that , yes I think it was Joan of Arc , and as Joan of Arc put the French King back on his throne and saved France so Denise 's mother thinks she is going to put the king back on his throne and save France and incidentally her chateau and her property . You ought to hear them , my God you ought to hear her , just hear her , yes it 's all true enough she is a descendant of the family of Joan of Arc , she has all the papers , yes it is true , my God it is true , they make me sick . CONSTANCE Henry have you heard about the armored train ? I saw it pull out in the direction of Bourg . Is everybody warned ? HENRY You bet everybody is warned , did you send the message when it left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the station I sent word , by Georges Poupet .

HENRY All right . Whose baby did you see , anybody 's baby you know ? CONSTANCE Yes , an American  --  Yes my cousin 's baby , not your cousin 's baby , my cousin 's baby . HENRY Oh Hell . CONSTANCE What shall we do ? HENRY First thing to do is to do nothing . How did you recognize him ? CONSTANCE By the way he wears his hat , it 's a family matter that , only blood cousins wear their hats like that , none of your cousins wear their hats just like that , and it 's hard to copy , just the way it sits on the head . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . HENRY All right , pay no attention , and if he gets on a train , let him alone , always let everybody alone , let everybody alone . CONSTANCE Just a minute , just a minute , yes there is the train , do n't turn , Henry . Yes he is on , the train is moving out . God bless him . HENRY Perhaps you were mistaken . CONSTANCE Do n't you believe it . I know a cousin when I see him , you can not fool me , he was a cousin . p. 46 HENRY Say , you better shut up , here comes somebody who is nobody 's cousin , at least I hope to God he is nobody 's cousin . CONSTANCE What . HENRY Oh for Heaven 's sake shut up . ( A GERMAN SOLDIER approaches them ) GERMAN How do you do ? CONSTANCE AND HENRY How do you do ?

( And then looking at HENRY suddenly ) How many maquis are there in this town ? HENRY Maquis , Maquis , there are no maquis in this town . GERMAN What is the use of saying there are no maquis in this town ? I know how many maquis there are in this town , I know their names , I know where they live , I know what they do and I admire them , they are defending their country . I admire them . p. 47 HENRY I tell you there are not any maquis in this town , I know this town , I know everybody in this town , I know perfectly well that there are no maquis in this town , it is not a kind of a town to have maquis in it , they are not the kind of people to be maquis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are no maquis in this town . GERMAN Of course there are maquis in this town , I can tell you the exact number of maquis , there are seven maquis in this town , there are three militians and there are seven maquis , but you just tell the maquis that they need not be afraid . I admire them and I would never let anybody do them any harm , not anybody , I admire them , they are good citizens , I admire them . HENRY I tell you there are no maquis in this town , how can there be any maquis in this town ? Look at that mountain , have you ever been up that mountain , have you ever gone hunting up that mountain with a dog , well you would know you would have to take along a bottle of water for the dog to drink , and how can there be maquis on a mountain that has no springs on it , do n't be silly , all this talk about maquis makes me sick , there are no maquis in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have maquis in it , I tell you there are no maquis in this town .

They are good citizens , I admire them . ( And the GERMAN walks away ) p. 48 CONSTANCE Who is he really , Henry ? HENRY I do n't know who he is , they call him the interpreter , I do n't know who he is , they say he is a degraded officer , I do n't know who he is , nobody knows who he is or what he is , he just talks like that , he talks like that every now and then he talks like that , and nothing happens , he always talks like that and nothing happens .

CONSTANCE But it did come . HENRY Of course it came , would I be here if it had not come ? My gracious I am cold , I am frozen . Give me a drink . My gracious it was cold . ( CONSTANCE giving him a drink ) CONSTANCE ( Timidly ) And Henry , did you hear anything about that man I said was my blood cousin , did you hear anything about him ? HENRY What should I hear about him , you do n't suppose he would be so foolish as to be sitting on top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the way we do , anyway perhaps he was n't an American . CONSTANCE But he was , Henry , he was I can always tell , it was the way he walked , but mostly it was the way he wore his hat . An American man wears his hat differently from a Frenchman or an Englishman . Yes he does . p. 50 HENRY Well , all right , all right , perhaps he does wear his hat differently , yes I told the boys if they know anything to let us know , but how can they know which one we saw . It might have been a Canadian . CONSTANCE ( Doubtfully ) It might . HENRY Well anyway there was one thing , the TNT is here and it 's hid and now to move it , your American ca n't help with that , so forget him . He seemed to know where he was going . Now you know where the stuff is hid , will you get it moved and I 'll go back to the factory .

My little girl was there and she said I was at work and her mother was out and she did not have the key , so they said they would wait and my wife came along and they asked where I was and my wife said that of course I was at the railroad yard working and what did they want . Well they said they wanted to look around , certainly she said come in and she took them in and she opened a bottle of wine and they said they wanted to look around , and she said certainly , you must do what pleases you , and they said well they guessed there was nothing particular to look for , and my wife said not that she knew of and they drank some more wine and then they went away . When I got home I was more worried than my wife because in the attic there was a lot of stuff . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in my wine cellar but how to let them know . CONSTANCE Do n't worry about that , they can be let know . POUPET All right , Mademoiselle , you can count on me . They never notice me . I put the pack on my back and I carry a hoe on the front of my bicycle and they think I have just dug up my potatoes . p. 52 CONSTANCE But can there always be potatoes . POUPET Ah , in this country Mademoiselle , there are always potatoes young potatoes or old potatoes and if there are not potatoes there are turnips , do n't you worry Mademoiselle , just you let them know where my wine cellar is and I will leave the key in a hole in the wall . There is no wine there so they can come . Goodbye Mademoiselle , I 'll come in and tell you if everything is all right . CONSTANCE Goodbye , Georges . I wo n't wish you good luck because that does sometimes bring bad . Do you know when I used to see you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be jealous , I thought you were getting more to eat out of the country than I was . POUPET Well it is getting something to eat all right because the sooner we get these birds out of the country the sooner we will have more to eat . Goodbye Mademoiselle . ( GEORGES leaves . CONSTANCE watches him go . DENISE comes running in , breathless ) DENISE Constance , Constance , oh Constance , Constance . CONSTANCE What is it Denise , what 's the matter ? DENISE Oh Constance , this morning I was not feeling very well , I was tired and so I did not get up but decided that I and my little daughter , the tiny little baby Christine and I would have our breakfast in bed together . I always dreamed when I was a little girl that someday I would be grown up and having a baby girl and we would have breakfast in bed together . Well we were having breakfast in bed together and I thought I heard Henry 's voice outside and I payed no attention and we went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then I thought I heard another voice and then suddenly I knew , it was Ferdinand and then I sat up in bed and I cried and I cried and I cried and Baby Christine cried and I cried and I cried and there was Ferdinand standing in the doorway and I cried and I cried . p. 53 CONSTANCE And what did Ferdinand say ? DENISE Say , what did he say , why he did not say anything , he was just there and as I cried I said , look Baby Christine is just the image of you . I always tell Henry so and he says so , Oh Ferdinand she is just the image of you and there I sat in the bed and I cried and cried . CONSTANCE And what is he going to do ? DENISE I do n't know , Constance , I do n't know what he is going to do , he is going to see his family , I suppose he is going to see his mother and his father , oh Constance . And I must go back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dashes away ) ( Suddenly FERDINAND appears at the French doors ) CONSTANCE ( Running to him ) Oh , Ferdinand . FERDINAND Yes , I am here . CONSTANCE Are you really here ? FERDINAND Yes , I am really here . CONSTANCE Stand in the light , let me look at you , you do n't look thin , you look rather fatter than you did but your color is not good and your lips are pale . FERDINAND Yes , that German food is bloating , it does not suit French stomachs . p. 54 CONSTANCE But did you have enough ? FERDINAND Enough , whatever you have is enough , but we helped out by buying black . CONSTANCE But I thought they said there was no black market in Germany . ( FERDINAND goes to fireplace ) FERDINAND ( Laughing ) No there is no black market in Germany for Germans but there is lots of black market in Germany for foreign workers . You see foreign workers work everywhere , on farms , in bakeries , in butcher shops , in grocery shops and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everybody steals a little and they trade it and they sell it among themselves , the Germans have nothing to do with it and then others go out and steal a little of the stacks of vegetables that are covered with earth . In one way and another there is a lively traffic among foreign workers . CONSTANCE But is n't it dangerous , do not the Germans punish it dreadfully ? FERDINAND Germans , what can they do , it takes all their police to keep their own people under , they have none to spare for the foreign workers , there are almost ten million of them , what can the paltry police do with that , no , we have no arms , we can not resist or fight but we can steal and we all do and I tell you that the black market for foreign workers is a mighty lively affair . p. 55 CONSTANCE ( Sitting down near fire ) It is all so strange , tell me more . Did you suffer ? FERDINAND Suffer for myself , no . I was very well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my factory they made me what they call the confidence man , that is the man who acts between the French workman and the Germans , to settle quarrels and difficulties of all sorts . That is the reason I am here , as a man of confidence I was given ten days leave . CONSTANCE And then , Ferdinand ? FERDINAND And then I disappear . CONSTANCE Into Germany ? FERDINAND No Constance , not into Germany , no not into Germany , in a way there my life was not hard but in a way , you know I went to see my brothers . I did not see both , I only saw one . ( He sits beside her ) Oh it was pretty bad . Because of my position in the factory they gave me permission to go and see my brother . I travelled a good many miles and then at last I saw him , well up in the north . I went by railroad , and when I arrived they took me in to see him , it was in a room and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in accompanied by two guards and one of them sat down at a table and there were two chairs opposite for us . When I saw my brother come in , three years of prison , three years , more than three years , tears came to my eyes and I almost broke down . My brother gave me one stern look and I pulled myself together , I understood , a Frenchman should not shed tears before a German . We sat next to each other and I showed him the photographs I had brought from home and he showed me those he had on him all that time and we each one put his back in his pocket . And the German adjutant said , you have exchanged photographs which you were told not to do . Silence , said my brother , you have a list of the photographs I had , examine them , see if they are changed , and he placed his package on the table , the man mumbled something . Examine them , said my brother , and apologize , and the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother and I parted , he was still a French officer with the pride of a French officer . p. 56 CONSTANCE You poor boy . FERDINAND Yes , while we were in the factory , it is funny you know there are so many funny sides to a Frenchman . You know I hate to say it but it is true the French were the only ones in the factory that did any work and not because they wanted to help the Boches , goodness knows not that . Not any of them that , not even Denise 's brother Christian , not that , but Frenchmen ca n't see work before them and not do it , they are funny that way , they are . If they see work before them they do it , they just ca n't help themselves , they just ca n't so they were the only ones who did any work , most of them , the Greeks and the Italians and Poles , etc. , did not work just because they were lazy but the Russians , oh the Russians they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't . How horribly they were treated , beaten and starved and then not until they were almost dead did they give in and work for a month until they had built a little strength and then they would again refuse . CONSTANCE And did you get to know any but the French ? FERDINAND Only the Russians . You could n't trust the Poles , the Belgians , the Dutch , they might betray you and the Italians and the Greeks were not interesting , but the Russians you could trust as you would a Frenchman . One I got to know very well . One day he said quite calmly , some day we will beat the Germans , that I believe and when we have beaten them we will make them miserable . The quiet tone in which he said it , well you know we Frenchmen , we forget and forgive and forgive and forget . You know they say of us we have no rancor and we have n't . Well perhaps this time , perhaps . p. 57 CONSTANCE And now Ferdinand ? FERDINAND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I will disappear , nobody will know where I am not even Henry . I will disappear , I might be dead , I will disappear . CONSTANCE ( Rising ) Yes , Ferdinand . FERDINAND Goodbye Constance . CONSTANCE Goodbye Ferdinand . ( FERDINAND leaves . A long pause then voices from below ) VOICES Mademoiselle , Mademoiselle , Georges Poupet wants to see you , he wants to see you . CONSTANCE Tell him to come in . ( GEORGES POUPET comes in ) POUPET It 's all right Mademoiselle , it 's all right , everything is all right . It 's carried and it 's put away in my wine cellar on the mountain and the key is there , it 's all right . CONSTANCE And nothing happened , Georges ? POUPET No nothing , you know those stupid Germans , they would never suspect a man of fifty , a trusted railroad employee would be carrying explosives for the maquis in a sack on his back , not they , they are stupid , they think young men would be doing that , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never stop us old ones , and that is the reason we old ones do all the carrying . We do n't let any young ones do what we can do . They go up into the mountains , into the snow to receive it , we old ones ca n't do that and beside the Germans are scared to go up into the mountains , but the carrying , no we old ones do that . ( HENRY 'S voice outside calling harshly ) p. 58 HENRY Constance , are you there ? CONSTANCE Yes and Georges too , come in . ( HENRY comes in , his face is filled with fury and grief ) CONSTANCE What is it Henry , what is it , Georges is here , everything is all right . POUPET What is it ? HENRY What is it , what is it , those dirty beasts , those dirty Boches , those loathly birds , they have killed my father . CONSTANCE Killed your father , Henry ? HENRY Yes , killed my father . POUPET Killed your father , Mister Henry ? HENRY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a retired surgeon but he went around as there are so few doctors to do what he could , went around , old as he was , on his bicycle , and those dirty Boches said that he had taken care of some maquis and they caught him on the road and they shot him and they left him there . Oh my God , they shot him and they left him there , and my poor mother , all alone there . She telegraphed and she said the Germans killed him . She put it in , the Germans killed him so Denise and her damned family could not say that it was terrorists and maquis who shot him . Oh my God , oh my God . I love my wife , I adore my baby . ( Drops down on sofa sobbing ) Oh my God , oh my God . Where is Ferdinand ? p. 59 POUPET Mister Henry , Mister Henry , we will avenge him , Mister Henry , we will and soon . HENRY You bet your life , Georges , and mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of us will avenge him . Where is Ferdinand ? CONSTANCE Ferdinand is gone . HENRY Gone home to our family ? CONSTANCE No , Henry , no . He said he would not go home , he thought it best not to go home . He said he would disappear , and not even you would know where he was , he would disappear . HENRY ( Rising ) My God . POUPET Mister Henry . Curtain p. 60 Act 2 , Scene 2 ACT TWO Scene 2 CONSTANCE 'S salon , August 25th , 1944 . Intermittent gunfire in background . CONSTANCE is at radio , the gunfire draws her to window , then she rushes back to radio as HENRY enters . CONSTANCE Henry . What 's happened Henry ? HENRY My father is avenged . My knuckles are broken but my father is avenged . CONSTANCE Henry what happened ? HENRY We fought , we killed , we made prisoners and I beat the prisoners up . I did not shoot them , I beat them up , my knuckles are broken and my father is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so well , everything is terrible . Henry , Henry . HENRY There you are Constance , yes , how can you hate , how can you when you have never suffered , that is to say when your country has never suffered . France has suffered , how many times she has suffered , how many times she has been avenged . How often have sons avenged their fathers . I have avenged my father , and pretty soon now we will avenge our country , pretty soon . CONSTANCE Will it be very soon , Henry ? HENRY It will be soon . ( CONSTANCE sits slowly at sofa ) I have not told you but Ferdinand knew about my father being killed . p. 61 CONSTANCE Oh Henry , have you seen him ? HENRY Yes I saw him but he knew about it before I saw him . He hunted me up when he heard and after he too had avenged my father . CONSTANCE Did he ? HENRY Yes , Constance , he did , he did avenge my father . It is queer how he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mission to find out something that was happening and he had to go into a government office and there he heard two men talking and they told that my father had been killed . Ferdinand was there at the door and he heard them tell that my father had been killed . CONSTANCE Poor , poor Ferdinand . HENRY Do n't worry , my father is avenged , do n't you worry about that . Ferdinand did and I did it , they have paid , those dirty beasts have paid . CONSTANCE Henry , it is not true that I do not understand . I do understand but oh , dear . HENRY I know , it is all right , but you see , feeling the way you do , well it makes me sick . You do n't want the reward of your work . You 've worked well , but you do n't want the reward of your vengeance and so you do n't want the reward of your work , what work , the reward of your work is vengeance , and you do n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reward of your work . What 's the use ? Well , I do and I 'll have it . I have avenged my father , so has Ferdinand and now I will avenge France and so will Ferdinand . That is the reward for our work . You have worked well Constance , but you do n't want the reward of your work . You wait , not you but perhaps , well no use talking , no use , you 're nice , you 're courageous but you have no guts , Constance . You do n't want the reward of your work . ( HENRY storms out of the room . CONSTANCE begins to play with the radio , suddenly the announcer announces ) p. 62 ANNOUNCER Attention , attention , attention , Paris is free . Attention , attention , Paris is free . CONSTANCE I do n't care what Henry says , that is the reward of my work . ( OLYMPE and CLOTHILDE enter the room ) CLOTHILDE Oh Mademoiselle , is it true , is it , is it true that Paris is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is free . CONSTANCE ( Kissing them on both cheeks ) Yes , my dears , it is true , where is Georges , I want to kiss him , Georges . POUPET ( Coming in ) Yes , Mademoiselle , it is true , Paris is free and we are free , we have just shot fifty Boches that were left in the marshes , shot them like rabbits , they are like rabbits , when they do not win they run like rabbits and we shoot them like rabbits . I shot five . Shot them dead , all five of them . CLOTHILDE Of course you did , you good brave Georges . OLYMPE We heard you shoot them . CLOTHILDE When we remember how they occupied this house in forty and how they slept in the house . p. 63 OLYMPE And took sunbaths all naked on the lawn . CLOTHILDE And then the day of the Armistice , the beasts . OLYMPE We were just two sad lonely old women . CLOTHILDE And they put their phonograph in front of our kitchen door and it blared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one would come into the kitchen and call out  --  CLOTHILDE France Kaput . And we just would n't cry in front of them . OLYMPE No we just would n't . CLOTHILDE And they broke open our trunks and they stole all our shoes and stockings . OLYMPE All we had . CLOTHILDE Oh the dirty beasts , Germany Kaput . OLYMPE Germany Kaput . CLOTHILDE Oh Georges . OLYMPE Oh Mademoiselle . ( They both fall weeping ) Yes , now we can cry , now they are gone , gone forever . CLOTHILDE Yes , now we can cry , now we can . p. 64 CONSTANCE ( Patting them both ) Now pull yourselves together , we have to make flags , French flags and American flags and English flags and Russian flags . POUPET No use in making them , Mademoiselle , you can buy them , and American and French flag ribbon . CONSTANCE From whom ? POUPET ( Laughing ) From the bazaar , the biggest collabo in this town , the one who said everybody should send their sons to Germany to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his . He has his store full of flags . French flags , English flags and ribbons , no , no Russian flags . Everybody is in there buying them , he is just coining money . CONSTANCE Will I ever understand ? But Georges , where did he get them ? POUPET Get them , he always had them , he was sure the Germans were going to win but he kept them all , well he always keeps everything . I suppose some of them were left over from the last war and now he is as pleased as anything to have them and to sell them and everybody is as pleased as anything to buy them . CONSTANCE But Georges , how is it that the Germans did not find them ? p. 65 POUPET Because he had them put away , hid them if you like , but what difference would it make . The Germans , bah , the Germans , they never found anything . CONSTANCE Well , all of you go to that collabo and buy a lot of them and we will cover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children . ( They all go out . DENISE comes rushing in ) DENISE Hello Constance . CONSTANCE Are you pleased , Denise , pleased that Paris is free ? DENISE Of course , of course , well yes , of course , although , well yes , of course , do you know Constance , Achille is joining the army , he says that he will help the Americans beat Japan . CONSTANCE He does say that does he . Well you can tell him from me , that the Americans do n't want him , they wo n't have him . You can tell him that from me . DENISE What do you mean , wo n't have him ? They have to have him , the French army wants him , of course they want him , he has written to his old captain to tell him he is ready to join him . My gracious not want an aviator who has brought down six enemy planes . Of course they will want him . CONSTANCE ( Angrily ) I tell you they do n't want him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take him if they want him , we do n't . But anyway Denise , what does he want to fight for now , why does n't he stick to his opinions ? p. 66 DENISE Of course you do n't understand , you never understand . As long as the Marshal was at the head of the government , he obeyed the Marshal , any good soldier would and now that the Marshal is not any longer at the head of the government , why naturally Achille obeys the man who is at present at the head of the government and so he joins the army . Anybody ought to be able to understand that . CONSTANCE So Achille is just like a dog , when you tell him to come to heel he comes to heel and when you tell him to fight , he fights . What 's the use of being a man if you are going to be like that , what is the use ? Well I can tell you the American army does not want anybody like that fighting with them . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You are just jealous , you do n't know anybody who has ever brought down six airplanes . CONSTANCE And did not wear his decorations because he was so modest although everybody knew about it . DENISE You are horrible , I always hated you but when America was not successful I did not care so much but now that America is successful , that she has gotten rid of the dear Marshal , that she has opened the door to Bolshevism , that she hates the aristocracy , I tell you Constance , I just hate you , hate you and all Americans , I hate you . p. 67 CONSTANCE And still Achille wants to fight side by side with them . DENISE Well , if he does it is because he does because as a soldier he does . CONSTANCE There is no use talking , Denise , they wo n't have him . Nothing could make me believe the French army would have him . No I do n't believe they would have him in spite of his six airplanes . No , all this time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is free we tell each other what we really think . No the French army does not want Achille . DENISE You beast , if they do n't take him I know it will be your fault , the fault of those awful Americans , and it will break my mother 's heart and it will disappoint Achille , and never , never , never , no never will I speak to you again , no never . ( She rushes out . CONSTANCE sits down heavily ) CONSTANCE Oh , my gracious . ( OLYMPE and CLOTHILDE come in with arms full of flags ) CLOTHILDE Oh , Mademoiselle , just think there are lots of little children in this town who have never seen any flag . OLYMPE Not any kind of a flag , not even a Boche flag . CLOTHILDE You know they never carried flags , we do n't know why but they never did and little children who are now five and six years old have never seen a flag . p. 68 OLYMPE And certainly never seen a French flag . You should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And one little one wanted to know what it was . OLYMPE And we knew you would like it and we pinned pieces of American ribbon on each one and then we made them stand up in front of the French flag and say , " Vive la France . " CLOTHILDE " Honor to the Maquis . " OLYMPE And the darlings , they all said it . CLOTHILDE And we were so happy and they are so happy and it is all so wonderful . OLYMPE We are free and everybody 's eyes are all smiling . CLOTHILDE Oh dear me . ( They both begin to cry ) OLYMPE Yes . ( They both begin to laugh ) CLOTHILDE We can cry now all we want . OLYMPE Yes , Mademoiselle , we can . ( HENRY enters ) HENRY Hello you old dears , my gracious , you have gotten flags , has the old collabo any left now that you have bought out the collection . Well , hang them out , hang them out . ( OLYMPE and CLOTHILDE exit with flags ) p. 69 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Denise , a really dreadful quarrel . HENRY ( Pouring himself a drink ) Did you ? Well one does and one does not but one mostly does , did you ? CONSTANCE Yes , Henry and this time really this will . You never can tell . CONSTANCE Henry , do n't be so unfeeling . HENRY Unfeeling and I have just come from a wonderful family scene , Denise was not there , she was busy quarreling with you but all the rest of them were there . CONSTANCE And Achille . HENRY Achille , my gracious , poor Achille , he is holding his head and surrounded with papers he must sign to get back into the army . But in every one there is the question , what did you do for the resistance . No , they do n't say , what did you do in the great war , daddy , but what did you do for the resistance . And , oh my goodness , Achille , what did he . CONSTANCE Well then he wo n't be taken into the army . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something for the resistance . You never can tell perhaps he will find out that he did something for the resistance , perhaps he will . p. 70 CONSTANCE Oh Henry , it is so awful now we are all so happy and we are all quarreling . Oh Henry it is awful . HENRY Why not , if not why not . Oh you ought to see them . You see now of course , now there is going to be communism , anyway that is the way they feel about it and they think , the old mother thinks , of course the old father never thinks anything , the old mother thinks she better divide up the property among the children so the communists wo n't notice as they might if it was all together , but she hates to let go . How she hates to let go . CONSTANCE And what do you get , Henry ? HENRY Well , as the most unpopular son-in-law I only get a duck pond with the meadow around it . My , it 's funny . Hello , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , well . CONSTANCE Ferdinand . HENRY Yes , there he is . ( FERDINAND comes in ) FERDINAND Paris is free . HENRY As if we did n't know it . Yes , Paris is free . Have you said goodbye up at the house , Ferdinand ? FERDINAND Yes , I have said goodbye . HENRY Well , so long , old man . p. 71 FERDINAND So long . ( HENRY embraces FERDINAND and goes ) CONSTANCE Why are you saying goodbyes up at the house ? FERDINAND Because goodbyes have to be said . CONSTANCE Ferdinand , you know I have had a dreadful quarrel with Denise and I do not really think that we will ever speak to each other again . FERDINAND Does that really matter , Constance ? CONSTANCE Ferdinand , what do you mean ? FERDINAND Why should it matter , it 's all over . You will never see any of us again , you wo n't see Henry . Henry loves his wife and adores his little girl and it 's all over and that is all there is when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over ? FERDINAND Yes , really all over . You will go back to the quays of Paris and sooner or later to roasted chickens . CONSTANCE And you , Ferdinand ? FERDINAND Ah , this time I do disappear . CONSTANCE Disappear , where to ? FERDINAND Hush , you did say that yes is for a very young man . You must not ask but I 'll tell you just the same , to Germany . No I do not go back there to work , but I am being sent to organize my fellow countrymen . p. 72 CONSTANCE Ferdinand . FERDINAND Yes , Constance , this is our war , you have done your share , your countrymen will fight some more , but this is our war , our war , and we will fight it and we will win . CONSTANCE Yes , I know , and so it is all over . FERDINAND Yes , look facts in the face , Constance , for you it is all over , for Henry it is all over , but for me it is just beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , Ferdinand , yes Ferdinand . FERDINAND I wo n't have time to think so I wo n't think about you and the quays of Paris and the roast chickens and Henry and Denise and the little girl who looks like me , no I wo n't have time to think .
