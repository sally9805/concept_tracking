Wendell Willkie , the bear that walks like a Republican , scooped out some honeycomb wisdom for his political followers . What should be the role of a political opposition in wartime ? Said he to the National Women 's Republican Club : <P> " Republicans , it is our duty as a party and each in his individual capacity to do all we can to assist the man who has been appointed to bring American productive effort to the utmost . <P> " Friends of mine say to me from time to time , ' Mr. Willkie , do n't you know that the national Administration and the Democratic Party are using the defense effort for political purposes ? . . . Do you not recognize the conniving that goes on in Washington ? ' <P> " My fellow Republicans , no one in the U.S. sees these things with a sicker or more weary heart than I do . Others say , ' Since you recognize these things , do you not want the Republicans to adopt similar methods ? ' My plea is : ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it because this country is at war . Do n't do it because freedom is at stake . ' <P> " The Republican Party should be engaged in finding more efficient ways of winning this war , in finding better ways to build the instruments of warfare , in seeing to it that our military operations are carried out effectively , that the people 's substance is not wasted . . . and that social changes are not brought about in the guise of the emergency . ... As Republicans it is the most practical thing to do . ... <P> " If the Republican Party becomes and remains a constructive force for the saving of freedom , then the Republican Party will return to power . If it returns to power as such a force , it will play a major part in the reconstruction of the world after this war , the construction of a world in which free men can live . "
