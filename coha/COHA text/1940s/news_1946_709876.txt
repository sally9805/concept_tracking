txt Condemning the rank-and-file strike of 2,500 United Parcel Service drivers as unlawful , Supreme Court Justice Kenneth O'Brien granted a temporary ' injunction yesterday- prohibiting the strikers from picketing the delivery entrances of thirteen large department stores . In a statement accompanying his decision , Justice O'Brien asserted that , his efforts to settle the four-week-old strike had been thwarted by rho uncooperative attitude of the insurgents in Local 804 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters , AFL . He declared that the company and the regular executive board of , the union had shown a . willingness to negotiate in good faith , but that the rankand-file group insisted on the attainment of ends that had nothing to do with wages . " Consideration of the merits of // this application for an injunction indicates that the strike was called contrary to the constitution and by-laws of the union local and in direct defiance of the expressions and directions of the legally constituted executive board , " Justice O'Brien said . " It is apparent that this is not a legitimate strike for wages , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to accomplish other objectives . If the purpose of the strike is unlawful , so is the strike and likewise the picketing . " Union Declines Comment In the absence of official notice of the injunction , leaders of the rank-and-file group declined immediate comment on the court 's decision . However , Joseph Tortorella , president of Local 804 , who has aligned himself with the insurgents , said the order not to picket thirteen stores still left the strikers free to carry on picketing at 360 other department and specialty shops throughout the metropolitan area , where incoming and outgoing shipments have been halted by the walkout . He indicated that the insurgents would consult their attorney , John J. Sheehan , before deciding whether to challenge the injunction in the higher courts or through other action . Store officials indicated not participate in the application before Justice O'Brien would move to have the prohibition on picketing extended to their delivery entrances . The effect of the injunction would be to restore freedom of movement into the stores by trucks carrying merchandise to replenish their strike-shrunken stocks .

Agreement Is Reported It was the first time since the strike began that the executive boards , which have disavowed the strike , and the insurgents , who have had the consistent backing of the drivers , have sat down together . Michael J. Cashal , first vice-president of the international union , and David Kaplan , its chief economist , also participated in the meeting , at which unanimous agreement was reported on a program of twelve demands . Further hope was seen in the appearance at the meeting of a committee of top United Parcel executives , headed by James Casey , the company 's president . The company , which up to this time has refused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , took the demands " under advisement . " It made no commitment of any kind , but informed the union representatives that the company delegation would return to the Hotel Capitol at 2 P. M. today . Included in the wage program was a demand that drivers , who formerly received $50.50 for fortyfive hours ' work , be paid $60 for forty hours and that helpers , whose old scale was $39.50 for forty-five hours , now get $50 for forty . These increases are substantially greater than those received by general truck drivers under the Bohack formula , which provides $7.40 more pay for forty hours ' work than the drivers formerly got for forty-four . A meeting of the rank-and-file of Local 804 will be held at 2 P. M. Sunday at the Hotel Diplomat . Mr. Tortorella said the strike could be called off at that time if the reply of the United Parcel management to the joint wage demands was acceptable .
