The marble baby dimpling among the dried-up plants on the Manhattan art dealer 's window sill was badly in need of a bath . But to Dr. Walter Heil , director of San Francisco 's De Young Memorial Museum , his happy face and grimy little body had a familiar look . Andrea del Verrocchio , * Renaissance goldsmith , painter and sculptor , had carved some other youngsters very like him . <P> After long reflection , Director Heil bought the boy ( for a price he regards as his secret ) and took him home for a good soap &; water scrubbing . By this winter he had reconstructed the sculpture 's travels . In the 18303 , it was purchased for the royal family of Wrttemberg and moved from Florence to a palace near Stuttgart ; there it remained till after World War I , when a Berlin dealer bought it , later brought it to the U.S. , where it wound up in the Manhattan window . <P> Heil had little trouble convincing most fellow connoisseurs that it was a genuine Verrocchio , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Century master 's works . He proudly put the sculpture on display in his San Francisco museum . <P> Last week Heil had another feather in his discoverer 's cap . Florence , which in recent months has been sending its art treasures to the U.S. for display ( TIME , Feb. 7 ) , wanted to borrow the wandering Florentine boy for an exhibition in the Museum of the Bargello this spring . <P> <P> * Florentine Verrocchio is best known for his enormous and powerful equestrian statue of the hawk-faced Renaissance condottiere , Bartolommeo Colleoni , in Venice , and his elegant bronze figure of David astride Goliath 's head ; also for the fact that he was Leonardo da Vinci 's first teacher and was said to have turned from painting to sculpture when his precocious pupil surpassed him .
