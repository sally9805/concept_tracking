The Navy 's project for giving more rank to top U.S. commanders , which sank when General George Marshall refused to consider becoming the first U.S. field marshal , was floated again last week . In both houses of Congress bills were introduced to give Army and Navy top-flighters equivalent rank with their British opposite numbers . <P> George Marshall 's objection was neatly skirted by providing for a title with American precedent : General of the Armies . If the bills are passed , he and General " Hap " Arnold will get the new rank now held only by John J. Pershing , and held in the past only by three other U.S. fighting men : Grant , Sherman and Sheridan . <P> For the Navy 's new level , two candidates were also put up : Admirals William D. Leahy , the President 's personal Chief of Staff , and COMINCH Ernest J. King . Their titles in prospect : Admiral of the Navy . In the rank-conscious Navy , only George Dewey ( died 1917 ) has ever gone so high before .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
