In Washington few die and none resign , if they can possibly avoid it . " Going Washington " is a disease as definite as " going Hollywood . " Czars who have been superseded or are being circumvented cling on desperately , loth to give up their places on the fringe of the spotlight . <P> One solid , crashing exception has been Union Pacific 's bald , blunt , bull-built William M. Jeffers . As rubber czar , he memorized the Baruch report , especially the passage saying that " the program should be bulled through . " Operating day &; night on a devil-take-the-hindmost policy , " Bull Bill " Jeffers has butted his brow through so many walls , bellowed down so many other czars that he finally got a super-duper WPB priority overriding most other priorities . <P> Production of octane gas , escort vessels and aircraft might suffer ( there is no solid proof yet that it has ) , but the Bull closed his eyes to others ' problems , kept charging ahead . Result : the rubber program is shaping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he announced that , barring production mishaps , he would resign on July 1 and go back to his job as president of Union Pacific . This was cheering news ; apparently one man could surmount the lure of the spotlight . <P> But last week dopesters hinted that Jeffers might be the czar of a new and independent Civilian Supply Agency , might even run for Senator from Nebraska . Had the Bull been fenced ?
