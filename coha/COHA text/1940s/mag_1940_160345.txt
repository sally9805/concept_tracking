Lounging in Boston 's Ritz-Carlton this week . Ambassador Joseph Patrick Kennedy talked to Louis M. Lyons of the Boston Globe , two other newsmen , was mightily wroth when he saw Reporter Lyons ' bylined story of the interview . Excerpt : " Democracy said Kennedy is finished in England . . . . It 's all an economic question . I told the President in the White House last Sunday , ' Do n't send me 50 admirals and generals , send me a dozen real economists . ' . . . It 's all a question of what we do with the next six months . The whole reason for aiding England is to give us time . ... It is n't that she 's fighting for democracy . That 's the bunk . She 's fighting for self-preservation , just as we will if it comes to us . ... <P> " Eleanor Roosevelt is . . . a wonderful woman . And marvelously helpful and full of sympathy . . . . She bothered us more on our jobs in Washington to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the rest of the people down there put together . She 's always sending me a note to have some little Susie Glotz to tea at the Embassy . " <P> Quick was Joe Kennedy to try to square himself with the Administration , his British friends for undiplomatic garrulity . His principal explanation in a formal statement given the press : the interview was supposed to be off the record ; Reporter Lyons ' story " creates a different impression entirely than I would want to set forth . " Moaned the U. S. 's Ambassador to the Court of St. James 's : " Mr. Lyons made no notes during the visit . . . . Many of his statements were inaccurate . "
