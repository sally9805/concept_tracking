txt Few men  --  one must think of such figures as Freud and Einstein for comparison  --  have so deeply colored the thought of their generation as did Henri Bergson . He stepped into world fame with the publication of ' L'evolution creatrice " in 1907 . The book imme diately created a philosophic sensation . " It seems to me that nothing is important in comparison with that divine apparition. " wrote William James in the year of its appearance ; it is ' ' a marvel , a real wonder in the history of philosophy , making , if I mistake not , an entirely new era in respect of matter * * * a pure classic in point of form * * * such a flavor of persistent euphony , as of a rich river that never roamed or ran thin , but steadily and firmly proceeded with its banks full to the brim . " So great was the vogue of the volume and of its author that nearly 200 books have been written about Bergson and his philosophy in America alone . Bergson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life of instinct and intuition ; and in his approach to evolution he insisted that it was to be explained not negatively , merely by the destructive effect of the environment on unfit forms of life , but rather positively by the elan vital , the vital impulse , the inner urgency which was the real driving force of evolution . Some of his ideas influence a school of biologists even today ; but " Bergsonism " has long been anathema to professional philosophers of the rationalist school . " M. Bergson , " once wrote Santayana , " is at bottom an apologist for very old human prejudices , an apologist for animal illusion . * * * He is afraid of the intellect and the possible discoveries of science . " " What is the ? lan vital , " asked Santayana contemptuously , " that a little fall in temperature would banish altogether from the universe ? " Other eminent rationalists , like Bertrand Russell and Morris Cohen , have been hardly less severe . But Bergson 's influence on the thought of his generation was enormous . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Rousseau , whose influence is not to be measured merely by the conscious acceptance of the specific doctrines that they preach . The very phrases he coined have lived to become literary commonplaces . Even his sharpest critics could not withhold their admiration for the brilliance of his metaphors and the beautiful lucidity of his style . Some of them even spoke of " Creative Evolution , " praising its form while rejecting its substance , as " a marvelous poem . " Bergson 's influence on literary men and literature , certainly , has been greater in the last thirty years than that of any other philosopher with the exception of Freud ( and there was a striking relationship in some aspects of the thought of these two ) . It was merely with belated justice , therefore , that Bergson was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature for 1927 . Though the qualities of his thought and style have been so often regarded as typically French , it is interesting to recall that he came of Anglo-Jewish parentage and was French by naturalization . It is a tribute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though over 80 and in failing health , he declined the French Government 's offer of exemption from the law barring Jews from holding educational posts . He resigned his position in the College de France , one more victim of the Nazi war upon culture .
