Scientists often reach worthwhile goals by setting off in the wrong direction . Dr. Alma J. Whiffen of the Upjohn Co. did just that , several years ago . She noticed that Streptomyces griseus , the mold that produces bacteria-killing streptomycin , also produces a substance that is deadly to fungi . She separated it from the " beers " ( solution in which the mold had been growing ) , called it " actidione , " and tried it on fungi that cause human diseases . <P> As a drug to cure human ailments , it proved worthless . The Upjohn Co. gave the new drug to the Michigan Agricultural Experiment Station at East Lansing to see what effect it had on plants . In strong solutions , it killed young bean and oat seedlings . Apparently actidione was good for nothing . <P> But in the greenhouse near the slain seedlings were some grown-up bean plants badly infected with powdery mildew . Remembering that actidione was supposed to kill fungi ( including mildews ) , the Michigan scientists sprayed them with a weak solution . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still weaker and tried it on other afflicted beans . It worked like a charm in dilutions as great as one part per million ( 1 oz. to 7,497 gals . of water ) . <P> <P> This week the Upjohn Co. proudly announced that it had something new for agriculture : an antibiotic that might save the lives of the farmer 's plants , as penicillin and streptomycin have saved the lives of people . <P> So far , actidione has been proved only against powdery mildew of beans , tomatoes and roses under greenhouse conditions . But agricultural scientists are excitedly testing it on other plants infected with a long list of other fungus diseases . If actidione kills the smuts , blights , rusts and wilts of the major farm crops , it will have a tremendous effect on the world 's food supply : fungi probably steal as much food from man as all the world 's insects .
