Cotton-State Senators chortled . Headed by old ( 79 ) " Cotton Ed " Smith of South Carolina , they had fought a bitter minor battle . The War Department had plumped for the use of rayon cord in synthetic tires in place of cotton . The politicos , ever-sensitive in their cotton fibers , worried about the South 's loss of a good chunk of its domestic cotton market . Then , last week , the Senate 's Truman Committee mightily boosted the cause of cotton cord . <P> Rough- &-tumble; Rubber Czar Jeffers thought he had settled the question last October . At the War Department 's request he has bulled through most of his program to expand U.S. rayon cord capacity 100,000,000 lb. annually ( to a total of 200,000,000 lb . ) . He was all set to use rayon cord in all medium and heavy synthetic tires for the Army . To the outraged protests of cotton Senators ( who called Jeffers before the Senate 's Agricultural Committee ) Jeffers gave a flat answer : the Army wanted rayon ; the Army was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had proved rayon had higher tensile strength than cotton , greater resistance to heat . <P> The Truman Committee turned its heat on those " Army tests . " Said the Committee : the War Department had decided on rayon " without the benefit of any adequate tests . . . . " <P> Slipshod tests had been conducted , the Committee reported , under the auspices of military men drafted from the Big Four rubber companies . But even these tests had proved " cotton cord the equal of rayon in most sizes of synthetic rubber tires in the latest tests . Rayon has displayed no superiority over cotton to warrant the great investment in critical materials now being made to produce facilities for rayon cord . " <P> With a long political look ahead , the Committee gloomed : " The effect of the War Department predilection for rayon . . . will be a disaster to ... the South . " <P> Bull Bill Jeffers snorted : " So what ? . . . Experts of the Army , the industry and my office disagree . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
