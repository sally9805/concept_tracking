Dishonored Lady ( Stromberg ; United Artists ) features Hedy Lamarr , John Loder ( Miss Lamarr 's real-life husband ) and Dennis O'Keefe in a highfalutin piece of problem-nonsense designed to wow women matinee-goers . Students of movie ( and audience ) morals may be interested , too . <P> No " psychological " picture is complete nowadays without a case of amnesia , schizophrenia , paranoia or at least galloping dipsomania . In this case Psychiatrist Morris Carnovsky advises Miss Lamarr that her trouble is n't just an ordinary trouble , but a sickness , like alcoholism . Her trouble , as yet unmentionable on the screen in so many syllables , appears to be nymphomania . In order to cure herself , she quits her high-pressure job as an art editor , her high-pressure rake ( Mr. Loder ) and her fancy wardrobe . Can she find happiness in dirndls , a huge little studio hideout , her neglected talent for painting , and True Love ? <P> True Love ( Mr. O'Keefe ) , who rooms downstairs , is represented as a talented scientist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , in fact , a pretty depressing type of momma 's boy . It is only too clear to seasoned Miss Lamarr that this leaning tower of quavering male virginity could never survive the shock if he learned of her Past . He learns , of course ; the rake is murdered ; Miss Lamarr goes on trial for her life . True Love , Dutch-uncled by Psychiatry , comes of age just in time and snags the real murderer . The whole show may possibly be trying to point a moral : a lady can not play fast &; loose and expect her dream man to remain chaste .
