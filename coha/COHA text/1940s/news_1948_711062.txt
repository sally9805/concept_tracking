txt The second quarter of 1948 will see the end of Europe 's need for maximum United States coal exports , it was learned today . It is doubtful that there has been any more important development affecting European self-help and recovery since the beginning of the discussion of the European Recovers ' Program . The over-all shortage of coal , which has hampered and distorted industrial production in every European country , is nearly at an end , according to top coal authorities . This does not mean that all countries can get the right kinds of coal with the means of payment at their disposal . Nor does it mean that increased coal output is not needed as other obstacles to increased industrial production are removed . It does mean that if all the Coal covered in the Paris committee 's estimate for import from the United States under the aid program were actually shipped , there would be a coal " surplus " in Europe at the anticipated levels of industrial activity . The Coal Committee of the Economic Commission for Europe plans to allocate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarter , compared with availabilities of 13,500,000 tons offered by the United States . This means that there will be 4,500,000 tons of United States coal unallocated and available for export to any country that has dollars to buy it . There is not as much temptation to turn from American to European coal for price reasons now as there was a few months ago . The British have raised the export price to 75 shillings ( about $15 ) a ton , which , with transport costs added , brings the landed cost up near the $20 a ton that United States coal costs in European ports . In Mediterranean ports , the difference is even less . The Poles and the control authorities in the Ruhr have also raised prices to bump against the ceiling set by the American-landed price . Many coal experts think it would prove disastrous for European industry if costs were allowed to rise on the basis of the present high price . The British have already found many Continental buyers considerably less than avid to resume purchasing . However , Britain 's increase of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the steady growth in Polish exports , which are ahead of " schedule , " are partly responsible for the easier supply situation . Mild Winter A Big Help Mainly responsible , however , . according to coal experts here is the mild winter , which one source estimated today to have saved Europe a minimum of 10,000,000 tons of coal . The great shortage in Europe is still metallurgical coke , whose only important source of exports is the Ruhr . The easing of the general coal situation however , has made it possible to , give metallurgical coke to the countries that can use it to increase steel output and exports , a project that was greatly advanced this week during the meeting , of the steel subcommittee of the Economic Commission - for Europe . Asked how the expenditure of Marshall aid on unneeded coal imports from the United States could be reduced without impairing recovery , experts said that the best method would be for recovery-program coimtries to be required to limit imports from the United States to amounts allocated by the Coal Committee . In this way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sources would be sent as United States aid .
