 | QUAKING DEATH IN ECUADOR I AM JUST BACK after two days in the quake zone doing what little I could . The whole area is still shaking like a bowl of jiggled jelly . One lake has disappeared and another has been formed . Whole mountains have collapsed while new ones seem to be in the making . Sulphurous gases poison the air and the earth keeps up a continuous growling . Practically all of the buildings in our highlands are brick , stone or adobe . The walls collapse when shaken so hard and the terrible weight crushes anyone caught under them . The radio is telling how a mongrel puppy led a father through a series of gaping holes in a collapsed school to where the man 's little daughter had lain for 27 hours , her foot pinned under a large stone . As the father could get no one to help him , he put a tourniquet on the child 's leg and himself amputated the foot ? the  | only way he could get her out . This sounds like a fantastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange . We came across a little girl walking aimlessly along the road with her baby brother tied to her back . We asked her about her parents . " Mother is dead and Father is lying drunk beside the house , " she said . Her house was not far off . Like all the rest it had fallen in . The father lay there , slavering at the mouth and staring blankly at us . He was not drunk . He had lost his mind and speech . We took the three to the nearest temporary first-aid station . Hundreds of people wander about in a daze . I asked a woman with a broken arm dangling at her side why she did not go to the medical center and have her arm attended to . She looked blankly at us and kept asking , " Why ? Why ? Why ? " We had to lead her . Later we learned she had lost two children and her husband . THE LARGE CATHEDRAL of Ambato , the garden city of Ecuador , collapsed , killing 70 persons . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bautista Palacios , emerged alive . He had been wedged under the altar , which had fallen in such a way as to make a cubbyhole of safety . Yesterday morning in Ambato I saw an old friend of mine lying dead in the street with a huge cornice stone across his crushed body . Twenty of us managed to move the stone . It seemed so odd ? he had a smile on his face . And then a fly walked out of his half-open mouth . I turned away and was sick in the gutter . What keeps terror at a steady high pitch are the continued earth tremors in and around Ambato . We counted 14 in one night . You never know but that the next one will be a big one . With every new temblor , Indians and peons fall to their knees and pray at the top of their voices , so that a huge shout of prayer goes up from thousands of throats all over the doomed city . And long-robed priests scurry about with the crucifix in their hands , giving extreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the streets . Every now and then you hear a crash as a weakened wall goes down . The troops try to prevent people from going into buildings , but they continually elude the soldiers and get into their homes to salvage something of value . Often it is suicide ; they are caught by falling stones . One of our party broke a leg when a stone fell , though we were working in the ruins of the great market building which was a one-story affair and therefore deemed safe . At least 500 persons had been in the market when it collapsed . A few crept out and saved themselves . President Galo Plaza rushed to Ambato on the evening of the quake . He established his office on a park bench , with a rickety table for a desk . In one of his radio messages to the people he said , after describing the chaos and ruin , " I  | want dry eyes . II you wish to weep , weep silver for the destitute . " And everyone is contributing ? money , clothes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smell Ambato when you are a mile away . Many bodies can not be reached at all ; others lie where it would endanger the lives of workers to enter . The water lines and sewage system are gone . Troops are rounding people up at medical centers where a corps of Colombian and Venezuelan doctors are giving everyone preventive inoculations . You can still hear cries from the ruins and pleas for help , but they grow weaker and fewer as the hours pass . There are many cases of pneumonia among victims who have been exposed to the cold and drizzle for a night or two . By day , swarms of large black flies are everywhere . You can not frighten them away with a wave of the hand ; you must actually wipe them off your face . Rescue workers have no place to sleep but must lie in the grass in the cold rain . The first day I was awfully hungry and ate heartily from the supply wagons , but could never manage to keep the meal down . The odor and the sights turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and just drank black coffee . BANOS , one of Ecuador 's most popular resorts , was full of vacationers . The road to Banos is utterly gone ; it will take months to rebuild it . Planes fly over , dropping food , and they can see that the town is in ruins and the people are huddled in the central plaza . Several hundred injured are visible from the air , lying in rows in the open plaza . Pelileo is a city of the dead . Not one house is standing . The town was shaken as a terrier shakes a rat , and then it was dropped 20 feet . Simultaneously , the river which flowed past the town broke into a dozen streams that spread fanwise through the ruins . Over all this valley is a dank mist and there is the stench of 3200 bodies in the debris . The quake buried the living and coughed up the dead , heaving them out of graves in the cemetery . Disconsolate burros and cattle stand stupidly in the fields while homeless dogs prowl over the roofs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , these dogs . After some days of starvation they began eating human flesh , fighting off the vultures and the cats . As I walked over these houses I could hear growling and gnawing below me . Evacuation of the bodies never will be practical . It is hoped that enough fuel oil can be brought to burn everything . This morning , as I crept over what was Pelileo with a Red Cross worker , we came upon a small group , the only living people in the city . There were three sisters , ranging in age from 18 to 25 , I should judge . They sat upon a broken beam , sobbing and watching two Indians they had hired dig into the ruins of their home to get the bodies of seven members of the family .  | We sat down beside these grief , t ricken girls , offered them chocolate which they refused , and then we too , without realizing how it came , about , found ourselves weeping with hem as the Indians uncovered what had been the girls ' father . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distorted , rotting clay . So the Red Cross man persuaded the girls it was better to give up their idea and go away . Then he had the Indians cover the corpse again . We went back up the hill and to the high road along which the survivors are living in U. S. Army tents , 140 of them , part of a supply flown in from Panama . They house nearly a thousand refugees ; the rest make out as best they can with improvised shanties . Remember , 53 towns were destroyed ; I write only of two or three . I AM TYPING this in the mess tent of the Red Cross . Four society girls from Quito are the only women of the staff . Three of them are in slacks and low-heeled shoes ; the fourth is wearing high heels and a smart street suit , somewhat wrinkled by now . She was shopping in Quito when she saw her friends going by in an ambulance . She hailed them , climbed aboard and came just as she was . Now she is doling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of the tent . The Red Cross crew has given 7200 typhoid injections and 4000 whooping-cough shots in the last five days at this one station . Senora Maria Elvira Yoder , that grand woman of the Red Cross , brings in a young priest to talk to me . His name is Aurelio de Jesus Barros . " The afternoon of the quake , " he relates , " I was strolling along slowly on the street that passes our church . Suddenly I found myself buried to my armpits . One second I was walking . The next second I stood there looking down at my imprisoned body and legs . I was not in the least injured . It seems that I dropped into the earth . I heard the cries of the people . I saw the houses drop and collapse . No one ran into the streets ? there was no time for that . Those who were on the streets dropped out of sight or were covered with rubble . Nearly all of them died just as did those who were in their homes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my chest for three hours . Shortly after five o'clock an Indian got to me and dug me out . My shoes were gone but my hat had remained upon my head . " NEAR THE TOWN of Patate , which was as badly hit as Pelileo , a farmer had a grove of thriving young eucalyptus trees . The day after the quake he discovered that his whole grove of trees had slid a quarter of a mile to a neighbor 's farm . Few of the trees were down , which indicates that the movement was quite deep , not a surface shift . Here is a legal problem that will have to be solved . Who now owns the trees and the land the trees are growing upon ? Sheep and cattle , neglected , have wandered for many miles in their  | fright . Fences are down everywhere and the borders of property are often next to impossible to define , especially in cases where the earth shifted . Streams split up into countless rivulets , dividing and changing their course . Gaping holes opened in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the bowels of the earth , while at other places new streams , some hot and sulphurous , others ice-cold , appeared as if at the wave of a magic wand . At one side of Pelileo a gigantic crevice opened , a yawning , cavernous , evil mouth . And since the big quake , there has been an unending series of minor tremors which slowly , a jerk at a time , are shifting the ruins of the town over and down into this deep gap . No day passes but some score or more of ruined homes are shaken over the edge and down into this devil 's slit to fall no one knows how far . Even the ruins of this once flourishing town are disappearing . In hundreds of cases where workers have dug into homes they observed that dead parents were covering , with their bodies , the bodies of their children . They had thrown themselves thus , hoping to protect their little ones from falling roofs . An Indian woman was carrying her child in her arms when the earth opened beneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her own body . But even as she dropped she held her baby at full arm 's length above her head . Then as swiftly as the earth had opened it closed again , crushing the woman . Yet her baby , held above her head in her dead arms , was safe . The child was picked from those arms that protruded above the surface of the earth , just as a flower is plucked from its stem . SINCE THE DISASTER , there has been a steady stream of planes bringing food , medicine , clothing , tents and money to aid these stricken people . Two days ago a whole train of trucks arrived from Colombia , loaded with supplies . In a single day three planes from Argentina , four from Venezuela , three from Colombia , two from Peru and one each from Cuba and Bolivia arrived . This was one day 's mercy traffic . From Panama , United States military planes have been shuttling back and forth with emergency supplies , especially tents to house the homeless . Besides material things , doctors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and near to give their own hands in the work of saving lives . The warmheartedness of the Americas has matched this evil of Andean nature .
