In Yokohama , for more than two years , the U.S. Eighth Army has been operating a criminal court system almost twice as large as New York City's-and much more than twice as ugly , for most of its Class B and C defendantsts+ are Japanese officers and men charged with torture , brutality , head-choppings and assorted sadism under the guise of war . Last week , more than 500 cases had been disposed of and there were some 250 still to go . <P> In Idiocy . Frozen-faced Hisakichi Tokuda , the " Mad Doctor " of Shinagawa Prison , had found amusement in injecting soybean protein into the veins of prisoners . One victim had been British Merchant Mariner William Holland . The court heard how Holland 's legs had jumped and his mouth foamed in howling idiocy before he died . <P> Shusuke Wada was a nimble , hunchbacked interpreter nicknamed " Running Wada " by the American prisoners he escorted from Manila to Japan . Once , from the steaming hold of the Oryoku Maru came the desperate cry : " For God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! The men are dying . They 're drinking their own urine ! " Shouted Wada : " If they die , it 's no concern of mine . " Of the 1,619 prisoners , only 450 survived the trip . <P> The defense asked witness Lieut . Colonel Austin J. Montgomery how he could be sure the word Wada used was " concern . " Said lean , bitter Survivor Montgomery : " I consider myself pretty much of an authority on Mr. Wada 's English expressions . We called them Waddisms . " The court also got superlative evidence of the American soldier 's ability to wisecrack . Through parched lips , American prisoners had muttered : " Wada , Wada everywhere , and not a drop to drink . " <P> In Gratitude . Mr. Wada , apparently more hurt by gibes at himself than by revelations of his inhumanity , compressed his lips , looked wanly at the floor . Finally , Tokuda and Wada heard their sentences . The " Mad Doctor " would be hanged . Mr. Wada would get life imprisonment instead of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Few Japanese cared to talk about the Yokohama trials ; the documented details shocked many of them as much as the judges . Last fortnight , however , a little , old , obi-wearing lady appeared in the Advocate General 's office in Yokohama . She explained that she had read that her husband , convicted of chopping off a prisoner 's head , had just been hanged . From a bundle she took out a silver cigarette case . Bowing , she said : " I have come all the way from Osaka to offer this gift to the Americans in gratitude for the fair trial my husband received . " <P> On the other side of the world last week , some prisoners got tired of waiting . In Nrnberg , Field Marshal Johannes Blaskowitz , 64 , accused of butchering civilians and P.W.s in Poland , threw himself over a prison parapet , fell 30 feet to a tile floor , died of a crushed chest and punctured lungs . Next day , in Paris ' Cherche-Midi Prison , General Otto von Stlpnagel , 69 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hostages , finally succeeded ( second try ) in hanging himself with strips torn from his bedding and underwear .
