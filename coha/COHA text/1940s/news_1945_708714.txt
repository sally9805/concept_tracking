txt Prospects for the candy industry during the rest of 1945 are anything but sweet . Candy manufacturers are now operating on 65% of their 1941 sugar supply . Last year they got 807x . The War Food Administration has just announced in ' Washington that sugar for civilians for the third quarter will be reduced 24% from last year 's third quarter . Candy makers will have no choice , they say , but to curtail operations . Retail candy stores will he closed or . at best , shops ' hours Will be shortened . Candy makers have tried every possible way to extend production . When rationing went into effect they reduced or eliminated candies of high sugar content , such as bonbons and cream patties , and turned to caramels and nougats . Chewy candies can be made with corn syrup and honey . Some manufacturers relied more on preserved fruits and nuts to piece out their sugar in candy centers . Now corn syrup producers are rationing their customers , and honey is hard to get . Increasing purchases of these materials is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they just ca n't make enough sweats to allow the 18 pounds per civilian consumed in the United States last year . The average will be in the neighborhood of 12 pounds per person this year , say candy makers in Chicago . where nearly 40% of all the nation 's sweets are made . Four pounds of this presumed 12 was made in the first quarter this year , and 3.5 pounds will be made in the current quarter . The last half of the year , including the peak-demand Christmas season , will see candy produced at 2.25 plmnds a quarter . Even this is not a measure of the candy famine that " faces the civilian with a sweet tooth . The nation 's candy bill always rises directly with the national income ; the Department of Commerce calculates on that basis that civilians would have , eaten 24 pounds apiece in 1944 if they could have got it . . The National Confectioners ' Associalton sent a message last week to the special Ho se committee investigating food shortages , stating bluntly : " Present conditions beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , principally sugar  --  exert an unduly harsh impact upon the industry , threatening unemployment , and frustrating its plans for hiring returned veterans . " Ads for candy company workers , generously sprinkled through Chicago newspapers ' help-wanted columns last year , have disappeared . Advertising agencies are hearing about economies in candy manufacturer advertising . One of the big mail order houses will omit candy for the first time in its Christmas catalogue this year . The firm 's candy buyer could not get hold ' of enough to make it worth-while . What he is able to get will be sold in the company 's retail stores . Among the large candy manufacturers here who sell at retail , one chain whose stores used to , be open 14 to 15 hours a day has already pared its store hours to six hours a day . Two other chains ' shops are now open in the afternoon only , and they expect to ' reduce store'hours to one or two days per week , should there be a new cut in sugar supplies . Another company laments : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usage , we have been forced to close our shops for a day or two at a time so we can replenish emptied candy counters . " Famed Butter Creams Cut to Minimum One Chicago company , whose name is practically synonymous here with butter creams that melt in your mouth , took to the newspapers last week to tell customers why it could sell only pre-packed boxes of assorted candies , containing a few butter creams . The advertisement pointed out that candy makers get only 70% of the chocolate they used in 1941 and about 50% of the butter . Confectioners are on a ration point basis just like civilians when it comes to fats and oils . Like the housewife , each candy maker must decide whether to spend his points'for butter or for some other fat that takes fewer points . Companies that have specialized in butter creams and butterscotch patties , however , feel that it would be ruinous , to their reputations to start substituting other fats . given to companies for this production . Totel sales for the candy industry for April dropped 15% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five-cent items is expected to be resumed about August 1 , but theeArmy , wants only enough bars for 15 days inventory , and there will be fewer soldiers to supply . Some candy people say the War Food Administration just overlooked the industry ' ? ability to produce . Production of five-cent items soared to 46% of total candy production when ' ceiling prices made , it unprofitable to produce bulk candy to wholesale at 9 cents per pound . Bar goods sell wholesale at nearly 25 cents a pound . Others say the W.F.A. just plain over-bought . Shipping conditions and container shortages also kept candy from going overseas as goon as scheduled . New Candy Ration Tailored for Fliers The candy makers continue to supply candy for rations . They 've cooperated with the Quartermaster Corps in developing new rations to fit particular circumstances .
