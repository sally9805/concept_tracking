In the autumn sunlight Asuncion hardly looked like the capital of a nation caught in the throes of civil war . Indian women and heavily laden burros carried produce to market . Men loafed in the cafes , sipping small cups of coffee and yerba mate . The seedy Palacio Lopez , where Dictator Higinio Morinigo rules with his back to the nearby muddy Paraguay River , had the easy , unguarded air of an Illinois county courthouse . <P> But at night , nervous irregulars fired sporadically . And almost everyone furtively read typewritten transcripts of the " Voice of Victory " - clandestine radio broadcasts of war news , either real or imagined . In what they read last week there were only a few solid facts . <P> The Chaco garrisons , which had the best arms , had gone over to the rebels , whose forces dominated Concepcion . So had four training planes and two hydroplanes , which constituted the bulk of the air force . <P> Colonel Federico Smith , son of an English trader and a hero of the Chaco War , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces . He promised " peace at a small cost in blood and money . " <P> In well-trained troops , Smith probably had the edge , for his most effective fighters included a case-hardened cavalry division and contingents of marines . Smith 's opposite number in the rebel camp was tantalum-tough , moonfaced ex-President Rafael Franco , leader of the vaguely leftist Febrerista Party . <P> Rebel Talk . Brazilian newsmen , who had flown to rebel headquarters , reported that the city swarmed with insurgent troops , " obviously in the last stages of preparation for a march on Asuncion . " Before much blood was spilled ( only one patrol clash had been reported ) , Government and rebels might still arrive at some kind of an understanding . Wily Dictator Morinigo was reported to have sent emissaries to the rebels . He also sent a mission to Buenos Aires to ask help from Argentina . If Buenos Aires gave him no hope ( and there was no indication that it would ) , Morinigo would talk seriously with Concepcion . <P> After six years of dictatorship , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morinigo would have to hold out strong promises of better times to win the rebels and reunite the country . If appeasement failed , Paraguay might be in for a long civil war-although , with business already down 50% , the bets were against it . And there was always the chance , if Morinigo refused to make democratic concessions , that his own followers might decide that it was best for everyone to heave him out .
