The first clear picture ever made of a molecule was last week shown on a lantern slide . Some of the ablest U.S. scientists-members of the American Philosophical Society , founded 198 years ago by Benjamin Franklin-gaped in awe , for they were seeing something never before distinctly seen by man . <P> The slide was shown by Wendell Meredith Stanley of the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research to the annual meeting of the Society in Philadelphia . It was a picture of the virus which causes the mosaic disease of tobacco plants , one of the largest molecules known to chemists . It is a rod-shaped structure , about 40,000,000 times the size of the hydrogen atom ( basic unit of atomic and molecular weight ) . But even at this size it could be photographed only with the recently developed electron microscope ( TIME , Oct. 28 ) , which by using electron beams instead of light can magnify images 50 times greater than the best light microscopes . <P> Stanley and Thomas F. Anderson of R.C.A. , who did the micrography , also showed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by an encircling legion of antibodies manufactured in the bodies of rabbits in which the virus had been injected . The pictures confirmed Stanley 's theoretical reckoning that this molecule is about 20-millionths of an inch long and three-fifths of a millionth of an inch in diameter . <P> Scientists long knew that viruses caused smallpox , influenza , yellow fever , infantile paralysis , many other human , animal and plant diseases . But since they could neither see nor filter out viruses , scientists assumed that they were living , submicroscopic organisms . In 1935 Stanley showed that a pure strain of virus could be crystallized-consisted of lifeless molecules with the curious , lifelike power of reproducing themselves . This discovery closed the mysterious gap between living and inert matter , indicated no essential distinction except relative complexity of structure between atom , molecule , virus , cell and multicellular organism such as man . <P> Last week Dr. Stanley also reviewed his recent efforts to find which segments of the huge molecules are responsible for their virulent nature . Subjecting the molecules to chemical changes , he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new disease . Perhaps fortunately , the new-viruses so far revert to their original form in the second generation . But Dr. Stanley cheerily told his colleagues that he may yet invent some new disease . <P> Other notable discoveries reported at the meeting : <P> Carolina Craters . Like the moon , the coastal plain of South Carolina and nearby States is pocked with countless craters . The natives call them " bays , " perhaps be cause bay trees grow among the pine forests which often cover the swampy depressions , making them scarcely noticeable-they can be seen clearly only from the air . The craters are usually rimmed with sand , oval in shape , parallel and varying from a few hundred yards to three miles in longest diameter .
