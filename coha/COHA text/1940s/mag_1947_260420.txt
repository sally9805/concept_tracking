More than 1,500 Puerto Ricans arrived in the U.S. last week . The majority were beggar-poor , had no prospects of jobs or any training . They were the 1947 version of the Okies who had fled from the Southwest 's Dust Bowl . Instead of riding the highways , the Puerto Ricans rode the skies . Most of them arrived in the bucket seats of converted Army transport planes , operated by charter airlines at bargain rates . By last week , the migration from their crowded , poverty-stricken land to the U.S. was at flood tide . <P> Puerto Rico 's sugar economy can not support a population ( 2,045,000 in 1946 ) which has more than doubled since the U.S. took the island as a dependency after the Spanish-American War . About one in eight employable Puerto Ricans has no job . The average family wage : $20 a month ( about one-third of minimum needs by Puerto Rican standards ) . <P> Many of the migrants are young ex-G.I.s and merchant seamen , who got a taste of U.S. living during the war and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But thousands are middle-aged and elderly Puerto Ricans , who sold all their possessions to raise the plane fare . Said one Puerto Rican , a university graduate who left a shoeshining job in San Juan : " If they could swim , the chickens would leave . " <P> " Spanish Harlem . " The Okies were mainly California 's problem . The problem of the Puerto Ricans is chiefly New York 's ; more than 90% of them land in New York City . Estimates are that 350,000 are now in burgeoning colonies in Manhattan , Brooklyn and The Bronx . The worst congestion is in " Spanish Harlem , " a slum of old , dark , dirt-crusted , cold-water tenements on Manhattan 's upper East Side . <P> Spanish Harlem has become one of the most densely peopled places in the western world . Social workers have often found as many as 20 men , women &; children living in a single four-room flat . Beds are used in shifts . By day , the area 's streets teem with children . In almost every block @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the streets crawl with idlers and men &; women back from jobs as dishwashers , laundry helpers , needle-workers . The average wage for Spanish Harlem : about $30 a week . <P> Some of Puerto Rico 's economic D.P.s have already gone back to their land , discouraged by what they find in the U.S. But the great majority hold on ; bad as Harlem is , it is better than life in Puerto Rico . Hundreds of the migrants save enough in a year to make bargain-rate flights back to San Juan , only to return to New York with their relatives. * <P> High Price of Slums . Unemployment in Spanish Harlem has risen with each packed plane 's arrival , and New York 's state and city authorities have begun to worry about the area 's rising relief costs , crime , the swift rise in tuberculosis and venereal disease . <P> Puerto Rico 's home government , which knows that migration is the best and easiest solution to the island 's unemployment , hopes that somebody will work out a plan to channel the migrants to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flood would take a lot of doing ; the Puerto Rican in New York or San Juan is subject to no more restrictions or compulsions than any other U.S. citizen .
