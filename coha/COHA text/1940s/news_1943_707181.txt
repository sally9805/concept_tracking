txt COUNCIL OVERRIDES LA GUARDIA 'S VETO OF CUTS IN BEET In Stormy Session It Affirms $3,185,446 of Reductions Made in Mayor 's Figures 3 OF MINORITY GROUP AID Morris Challenges Legality of $1,000,000 Pay Slashes for Persons on Military Leave For the first time in its turbulent six-year history , the City Council in one of its stormiest sessions yesterday mustered enough votes to override Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia on budget cuts , restoring $3,185,446 of the total of nearly $10,800,000 in reduction that he had vetoed . This figure , tentatively announced by Joseph T. Sharkey , Council vice chairman and leader of the Democratic majority , pending a final check by city accountants , would bring the total of the city budget for the coming fiscal year down to $749,813,165 . To achieve reinstatement of these cuts , the Democratic majority in the Council , seventeen strong , had to pick up the votes of three minority members . These votes were supplied by John M. Christensen , Queens Republican ; Stanley M. Isaacs , Manhattan Fusionist , and A. Clayton Powell Jr. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line with the Democrats to reinstate every reduction , but the Manhattan members , voting as a team , suported reinstatement of cuts only where they felt they would not impair social services rendered by the city or cause the elimination of jobs . Legality of Action Challenged The position taken by the Manhattan members led to a challenge of the legality of the Council 's action on accruals . In voting , they supported the reduction of salaries of persons away on military leave to $1 . They insisted , however , that no other jobs would be eliminated . On dozens of occasions , pliminations of jobs were coupled in single lines with salary reductions to $1 , sufficient to keep positions on the city books . Midway in the . eight-and-a-halfhour session , Council President Newbold Morris ruled this modifying of line items was illegaL He said that if the practice were continued it would " open the door to an avalanche of lawsuits . " To bring the matter to a head , a motion was placed to sustain the chair 's ruling . It was defeated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had supported reinstatement of cuts voting with the Democratic majority . Mayor Sees Ferry Shutdown Mayor La Guardia , informed as he left City Hall that the Council was overriding his veto on a number of substantial items , the largest single one being fuel , predicted that the Staten Island ferry would have to be shut down by the end of the year because of the action . " If what you tell me is so , " he said , " the Staten Island ferry wo n't be running at the end of the year . I ca n't burn coal in those boats if they override my veto . I ca n't imagine that they will , though . " Told of the manner in which Councilmen Isaacs and Powell ' were voting , he indicated he believed it was invalid , declaring that lines may be restored or eliminated but can not be modified . The principal items knocked out of the budget by the Council 's action were nearly $2,000,000 for fuel , which Mayor La Guardia had asked in order to keep intact the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and roughly $1,000 , - 000 in accruals from jobs either vacant or being held for persons on military leave . The Mayor was sustained , however , on many other items , including the controversial $106,000 appropriation for operation of WNYC , the municipal radio station , for the coming year . Cuts in education , running in excess of $650,000 , failed to prevail , which constituted another major victory for the Mayor . He also succeeded in saving the $100,000 appropriation that the city is bound under contract to give the Public Health Research Institute for the coming year . The Isaacs-Powell combination refused to vote these cuts , contending they would impair needed city services . The session was one of the most // turbulent in the Council 's hectic career . Petty bickering , namecalling , fits of temper and outright clowning marked it . Lack of plan on the part of the majority further slowed proceedings . Hastily-called conferences on the floor and at the Council president 's chair often were required to iron lilt relatively simple parliamentary questions . Council members , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hardest budget battles since the Fusion administration came into power . From the time the Council convened shortly before noon to the hour of adjournment at 8:12 P. M. not a single recess was taken . Council members ate both lunch and dinner in their places or went hungry . The going was rough at times for Council President Morris , who , when he ventured to offer an occasional opinion or advice from the chair , was howled down by the Democratic majority . On one occasion Vice Chairman Sharkey barked : " You 're here to preside ? not to argue with us . Get going ! " The first indication of the turn the meeting was to take came shortly after Joseph E. Kinsley , finance chairman , read his committee 's report and urged its adoption . The report recommended that the Mayor 's veto of all budget cuts be overridden . The question immediately was raised whether this was intended merely to bring the report officially before the Council or whether it was intended to override the Mayor 's veto in toto . It took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided the motion was merely to put the report before the house . Another half hour was spent in determining the manner in which the thirty-odd veto messages of the Mayor would be considered . It was finally decided to take them up one by one . After the simple matter of how the meeting would be run was determined , statements were made in defense of the Mayor 's veto by Minority Leader Genevieve B. Earle and Mrs. Gertrude W. Klein , Bronx Labor member . Isaacs Explains His Stand It was at this point that Mr. Isaacs announced the position that he and Mr. Powell would follow . He said he would vote to sustain the veto " wherever the cuts affect adversely the important social or other essential services rendered by the city . " He added , however , that on some matters " the majority of the Council took sound action where I shall not vote to sustain the Mayor 's veto . " This was the first intimation for many in the room that the Democratic majority had rounded up enough votes to override a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First items reached as the Council went through the veto messages were cuts in appropriations for the various offices of borough presidents . These cuts were reinstated without exception , though with some slight modification in Queens , by a vote of 20 to 6 , the necessary three-fourths margin . As in the case of every city department where reductions were made in money sought for fuel , these cuts were reinstated . Personnel reductions restored by boroughs were : Brooklyn $79,560 , the Bronx $5,640 , Queens $68,100 and Richmond $71,610 . The Mayor had not vetoed personnel cuts in Manhattan because Borough President Edgar Nathan had conceded he could get along with the reduction originally made by the Council . The Council then proceeded to cuts made in the Controller 's office and it was here , for the first time , that the Isaacs-Powell team refused to go along with . all personnel reductions originally made . They said they would support reinstatement of cuts only where salaries of persons on military leave had been reduced to $1 . Even on this basis the office lost $44,493 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , provoked one of the first outbursts . Mr. Morris , objecting to the manner in which the Democrats at long last were trying to speed the votes , 9ried : " Do n't try to steamroller me ! " Mr. Sharkey then informed Mr. Morris that he was there only to preside and nothing more . " Just the same it 's downright monkey business , " declared Mr. Morris . " This matter you 're trying to rush through now would cripple the Department of Finance . " The net result was that a reduction of $23,628 was reinstated in the department 's personnel allowance . Similar action was taken on appropriations for the Department of Purchase , Tax Department , Board of Assessors , City Planning Commission , Department of Public Works and Department of Parks . The greatest single reduction restored was in Parks , where the personnel service loss totaled $284,926 . Then in a sudden reversal of the trend the Council sustained the Mayor 's veto of cuts for eduation and reinstated reductions in fuel allowances for the New York Public Library and the Museum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mayor Action came next on the municipal radio station , which was attacked by Councilman Louis Cohen , Bronx Democrat , as " being in the budget illegally . " He said the station claimed to be under the Department of Public Works but actually was not under that department 's direction . Mr. Cohen then proceeded to make a personal attack on the Mayor , describing him as a " disappointed general " who in his " bedtime story program is funnier than the comics . " He asserted the Mayor on this program " plays war correspondent , news commentator , critic of Federal agencies and many other roles in discussing forty subjects in a half hour . " Despite Mr. Cohen 's oratory , the Mayor was sustained . Despite this setback , Democratic spokesmen were jubilant at the manner in which the voting was proceeding . They predicted at the time that the Council would reinstate between five and six millions of the cuts . They were soon doomed to disappointment for both Mr. Isaacs and Mr. Powell refused to go along with cuts in personal service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in salaries to $1 for men on war leave in these departments had been made . As a result , veto of personal service item cuts of $1,099,999 in the Police Department and $800 , - 000 in the Fire Department were sustained , 18-8 . Similar action was taken on cuts of $31,194 for the Department of Housing and Buildings , $489,936 for the Department of Sanitation and $437,058 for the Department of Hospitals . The Isaac-Powell combine , while stating they regretted inability to vote reductions , helped sustain the Mayor . because jobs were eliminated rather than cut to a $1-ayear salary . Democratic efforts to cut out the appropriation for the Public Health Research Institute were defeated in spite of heated protestations that the work being done by this institution formerly was done in the City Health Department . The Council , speeding up as the hour grew late , quickly ran through the last few items , cutting personal service items for the Department of Correction by $140 , - 214 , for the Department of Marine and Aviation by $32,028 and for the Department of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refusing to allow a $9,999 cut in City Magistrates Court appropriations.
