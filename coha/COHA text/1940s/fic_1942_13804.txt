A chili stand on a highway in Texas . It is the front room of a small house that has been turned into a cheap little restaurant for serving coffee and chill . The place looks poor , improvised , lonely , but somehow cheerful , amusing . Down right , a door leading to the highway . This door is opened . There is a screen door . Outside this screen door is a noon light which says " Chili . " Down left a door leading to the house proper . Along the left wall , a long , homemade counter with a row of kitchen stools in front . On this counter , up stage , is a glass case with cigars , gum , etc . Behind it , a small gas stove , a second-hand ice box , shelves for food , dishes , etc. , a cash register and a small radio . There are many signed above the counter - " Coca-cola , " etc. - over the register one that says " No Credit . " In the back wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ center window , a slot machine ( a nickel one-armed bandit ) . Left of center window , a phone . Along the right wall is an old sofa . Center - down stage - a square table with two chairs . A window box with dead-looking plants in tomato cans at center window . It is about midnight . There is now little traffic on the highway , although now and then the rumble of a heavy truck can be heard . ZEPHA is on stage . Zepha is a pale , over made-up too-thin girl dressed in a cow-girl outfit . She has fine regular features , big rather sad eyes full of feeling , a very white skin and beautiful red hair . There is a look of race - good stock - about her , but she is one of those thousands of poverty-stricken , ignorant Americans defeated by trying to live off " the bad lands " from the Dekotas to Texas - the people called " Oakies " in the west and " poor whites " in the south . She is over-worked and under-nourished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - almost like an ache . But underneath the fatigue there is a fighting spirit ; under the ignorance - intelligence ; and underneath the poverty - pride . She is twenty-two years old . She sits on a stool behind the counter , her head down in her arms . She is sleeping . Over her head the radio is going - a plaintive , lonely cow-boy song . ( She is Texas-born  --  as most of the people in the play  --  and so speaks with a soft Texas drawl . ) ZEPHA ( lifts her head - listens to something she hears - a crash outside - runs to outer door - opens the screen - calls out anxiously ) Pop : Pop : Is that you ? ( There is no answer - she turns away from the door - she puts her hand to her head as though net clearly awake - she turns back to the door - calls again ) Pop : ( getting no answer she goes behind the counter to the cash register - gets some nickels - goes to the phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a number ) ( at the phone ) Is this The last Chance ? This is Zepha . Is Pop there ? Pop .  --  Has he been in tonight ? - If he comes in will you call me and I 'll come get him . You 'll surely call me , huh ? - Well , you promised the last time  --  and you didn't.  --  You promise every time but  --  ( she stops  --  the phone has evidently been hung up  --  she jiggles the receiver ) Hello  --  hello  --  ( she gives up  --  hangs up  --  dials another number ) Hello  --  Is this Callahan 's ? Is Pop there ? If he comes in will you  --  Enter from outer door TRUOKDRIVER He is young , strong , homely-goodlesing . She hangs up quickly  --  goes behind counter . p. 3 TRUCKDRIVER ( in the doorway ) If it ai n't the queen : ( crossing to counter ) Where 's Pop ? ZEPHA He 's gone huntin ' . TRUCKDRIVER Oh - ZEPHA Coffee ? TRUCKDRIVER Yes . TRUCKDRIVER Yep TRUCKDRIVER The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd have a grouch if you had n't been to bed for two nights . TRUCKDRIVER I have n't .

TRUCKDRIVER Jeez - I ca n't hear nothin ' . Them chains I got draggin ' in back of my truck  --  ZEPHA You did n't see anything at all ? TRUCKDRIVER I saw that wild well burnin ' over at Billings Field and I saw the sign on top of the Billings Hotel and  --  Say , you know what a fellow was tellin ' me down the road here ? He says Billings ' wife is easy pickins - anybody can make her . He says  --  p. 4 ZEPHA I mean - did you see anybody lyin ' on the side of the road or  --  TRUCKDRIVER If there was anybody , I guess I got ' em . Jeez , I was damn near alseep . ZEPHA ( putting down coffee ) Well - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she crosses to table ) It keeps me . TRUCKDRIVER How 's business ? ZEPHA Terrible . TRUCKDRIVER ( observing her ) You ought to get yourself up better if you want to bring in trade , Zeph . That cow-girl stuff ca n't get you nothin ' . Jeez , the girls at the Motel - they 're all done out in blue caps , red shorts and white bassieres ZEPHA Do n't they know the war is over ? TRUCKDRIVER They look like hell all right - but they sure bring in the business . You could do the same , kid . ( suddenly goes to her - pulls her to him - she hits him ) Hey . ( turns back to the counter ) Gim me a doughnut. ( as she goes behind counter to get it ) I would n't come in here if you did n't make them doughnuts No use tryin ' to make you . ZEPHA Land ! Every fellow that comes in here is thinkin ' about only one thing  --  makin ' somebody . ( gives him doughnut ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same . If you knew most of the Janes along this highway  --  ZEPHA Makin ' somebody - or makin ' some money . I can tell the minute they come in that door which one it is  --  a Jane or a job - a job or a Jane . TRUCKDRIVER ( still eating ) You 're the only straight one and everybody knows it . I asked the fellow that runs the drive-in . I said " That Zeph - do n't she ever give up ? " And he got sore as hell . " Zeph 's the finest little girl on this highway " he says . " Nobody 'll ever get to first base with her " he says . " Neve ZEPHA Do n't you fellows ever find somethin ' else to talk about ? TRUCKDRIVER What else is there ? ( gets up - starts toward bench ) Jeez I 'm tired - I 'm going to stretch out for a while . ZEPHA Do n't put your feet up on that sofa !

TRUCKDRIVER Do n't you ever give up ? Enter at outer door - MANUELA . She is a small , pretty Mexican girl in bright trashy clothes , but the pure oval of her face and her straight smooth hair parted in the middle giver her an odd Madonna look . MANUELA ( in the doorway ) Good evening . ZEPHA ( turns her back ) MANUELA ( crosses to counter - sits - waits ) Please - can I have a cup of coffee ? ZEPHA ( turns to her ) I 'm closed for the night . MANUELA Closed ? ZEPHA Yes . MANUELA Oh - excuse me - I saw the light on - I thought I could maybe have a cup of coffee - no ? ZEPHA I 'm closed .

TRUCKDRIVER What do you mean - a house ? ZEPHA I mean that little white ' dobe back a the warehouse - where she lives ! TRUCKDRIVER With all the flowers sittin ' around in old oil cans ? - bloomin ' - and - ZEPHA And two little half-naked kids playin ' in front - without no fathers ? TRUCKDRIVER You call that - a house ? ZEPHA Oh - I know it looks as innocent as a birdcage - but fellows like to go down there do n't they ? TRUCKDRIVER Yeah : And why ? ZEPHA You tell me. p. 8 TRUCKDRIVER Because they 're lonesome : ZEPHA Boo : TRUCKDRIVER Yeah - lonesome : ( goes to sofa - sits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they feel good ( - and they like to hang around a woman ! If it 's pleasant - if : At her place they can sit around - feel natural - feel like they are - have a tamale and a glass a beer - put their feet up anywhere they want - and if their belt 's too tight - they can open their top button without some dame beginning to yell her head off - and - ZEPHA ( affronted ) That will be enough of that . TRUCKDRIVER ( lyining down - feet on ground ) Listen , Zeph - do n't you ever feel you 'd like to be nice to a fellow - rest him up when he 's tired - and - ZEPHA Yes - sometimes . TRUCKDRIVER Well - why do n't you ? ZEPHA Because I ai n't common . ( as he makes a tired gesture - tries to put his feet up ) Put your feet up if you want - it do n't matter - much . Here - ( she goes to him - puts a paper under his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( she turns to return to the counter ) p. 9 TRUCKDRIVER Do n't go away , Zeph - stay by me. ( reaches for her hand - she lets him hold it ) Boy  --  this is restful . ( pause - then dreamily ) You know somethin ' , Zeph ? You 're the only respectable girl I ever gave a damn about . I do n't know what it is - there 's somethin ' funny about you . ZEPHA Funny ? TRUCKDRIVER Yep at the same time I 'm crazy to go to bed with yuh - yuh make me feel good . Yep - like I want to be good . Now how do you explain that ? ( she gives him a little pat - turns to go to counter ) ( he suddenly sits up ) Zeph , will you marry me ? ZEPHA ( turns ) Marry you ? I thought you said  --  TRUCKDRIVER I always said if I ever found a girl that was straight  --  and had the goods - I 'd marry her . ( as she goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's straight - I guess - but they 're dead from the waist down - and there 's plenty that 's got the goods - but you 're the first one I ever found - with both !

( as she still does n't answer ) Listen , Zeph - listen to Papa - Papa knows . You 're goin ' to fall for some guy some day so hard  --  p. 11 ZEPHA ( to him swiftly ) so what ? TRUCKDRIVER Ha - You have already . ( she is silent - turns back to window ) Have you ? ZEPHA ( to him ) Have I what ? TRUCKDRIVER Fallin ' ? ZEPHA What do you mean - fallin ' ?

( turns back ) That 's something we got here : Only we folks never go in it . MRS . CLEMM Why not ? ZEPHA Costs too much . Why they say there ai n't a sweller hotel in the whole U.S.A. It 's got a penthouse : Did they tell you ? Billings built the whole hotel just so his wife could have one of them . He 'd given her everything else - then she had to have a penthouse .

CLEMM I 've never even seen him : She got him to give us the job - now when we get here he does n't even show up for dinner : Would n't you think a man as rich as that would go some place and get cured : ZEPHA You ca n't cure em unless they want to be . They got to show some gimp of their own first . That was all written out in " The Ladies ' Home Journal . " I guess he drinks to forget her chasin - and maybe she chases to forget his drinkin.

I felt I could n't go on . I tell you - I did n't know how long I drove , but when I come to , I was across the California border ! - and I found that letter in my pocket that you gave me ! - and I hit right for that place . p. 101 ZEPHA ( interested ) ( turns to him ) You did , Mr. Billings !

I know what 's wrong with me and I know what the cure is . I 'm a drunk , " I said . " I 've been a drunk for twenty years . The drink is the disease and stop drinkin is the cure . You do n't have to have all them tests , " I says , " to find that out ! " But they just kept shootin ' em to me . " We got to go at this scientific " they said . " We got to know your condition , " Heart - lungs - stomach - liver - everything - the whole works - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I never saw so much science .

" And here I am . ZEPHA ( sits ) I did n't suppose any of them cures could cure like that . BILLINGS Science ! Pure Science ! Yep , I 'm a free man ! - free in every way . My wife 's divorced me - did you know that ? ( goes toward her ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but  --  BILLINGS Yep - when I did n't show up that time - she got in a huff and went off - and done it ! - married the same day - married a big cow man from down the panhandle .

Everything 's been so harmonious ! - just perfect harmony - until - ( stops - overcome by all the disaster - she ca n't go on ) BILLINGS ( kindly ) Until what , Zepha ? What broke the harmony ? ZEPHA His goin ' - broke it ! BILLINGS Nope ! Somepin ' broke it before that - or he would n't a gone ! What was it ? ZEPHA Well - I told him to go away and leave me alone - but  --  BILLINGS That 's it ! Right there ! That harmony busted smack in his face - right there ! ZEPHA I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  BILLINGS There ai n't nothin ' worse than feelin ' you ai n't wanted- and when it 's the one you love - she do n't want you ! - I tell you - there ai n't nothin ' to help you over that - but gettin ' drunk - ( tenderly ) I 'll get him home for yuh. ( picks up his hat ) Where does he hit for usually ? p. 104 ZEPHA Usually Callahan 's first . BILLINGS ( going to door ) I 'll land him . ZEPHA Oh thank you , Mr. Billings . BILLINGS ( at door ) He 's got an old rum hound on his trail now ! - an ex-rum hound - ( hesitates ) Callahan 's , huh ? ZEPHA ( nods ) Or " The Last Chance . " BILLINGS Callahan 's or The Last Chance . ( starts out the door ) This is sure a test a science ! He goes out . ZEPHA ( gets up - moves to phone - dials ) Hello - is this Callahan 's ? Is Pop there ? Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Well you can try , ca n't you ? You can - BILLINGS ( appears at door again - in a brisk determined way puts his hat down on table ) Zepha , I 'm goin ' to make you a proposition . ( Zepha hangs up ) Do n't get me wrong . It 's strictly honorable , fair and square , but maybe a little previous , I do n't know . I just lost one wife last week - maybe I ought to - - ( dismissing it ) Things move fast these days . My folks come down here to Texas in a wagon - took ' em four months . Now they do it in four hours . That 's the way the world moves now - speed ! ( gathers himself together ) Well - I 'm alone now , Zepha , and man ai n't born to live clone . That ( s in the Bible ai n't it ? p. 105 ZEPHA ( on the defensive - she knows what is coming ) I do n't know as it is. ( tartly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's Bible . BILLINGS You do n't say . You 'd never expect that in a book like that , would you ? ZEPHA It 's Gospel all right . ( edges down counter ) BILLINGS Yeah - I guess it is . But it ai n't the line I 'm goin ' on . The line I 'm goin ' on - book , chapter and verse - is the one I said , " Man ai n't born to live alone . " That came over me , Zepha , like a revelation , when I went out that door there - into the dark . There I was - free as a daisy - and sound as a dollar - and nobody to give a damn whether I was - or whether I was n't ! Just goin ' out there , alone like that , it came over me again , right there , that lonesome feelin ' - lonesome - that only a drink of whisky can oure . At least I ai n't never found no other cure for it , yet - and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Science ai n't everything , Zepha . There 's more to livin ' than science ! Well - that brings me to my proposition . Will you marry me , Zepha ? Wait - hear me out . All my life , Zepha , I 've had a hankerin ' to have a fine , high-minded woman on my side - like you . If I had a fine girl like you in my corner - I would n't get licked like I do ! ( pause ) Well ? ( seeing her expression ) Wait ! Hear me all out . I know I ai n't such a prize package . I know it - not a first prize , but who gets a first prize , Zepha ? How many ! Most people are lucky to get second and third and then on - on down . Lucky ! and they know it . A sweepstake is a mightyrare proposition . What 's the odds ? One in a million . Did you ever hear of anybody winnin ' a sweepstake ? Did yuh ? p. 106 ZEPHA Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a sweepstake ticket right in their hands ! - and - lost it . BILLINGS No - I never knew nobody . ( pause - then ) Well - what do you say , Zepha ? Will you consider the proposition ? You 'll have all that a man 's love and respect and ten million dollars can give you . What do you say ? ZEPHA ( slowly ) This is awful strange , Mr. Billings - terrible strange ! BILLINGS What 's strange about it ? You 're - - - ZEPHA I been waitin ' all my life - for somethin ' like this to come to me - and now it 's come - I ca n't take it . BILLINGS Why not ? ZEPHA I just ca n't , Mr. Billings . I just ca n't . BILLINGS You 'd save a man , Zepha . ZEPHA No ! - no ! - I ca n't take that on ! Mr. Billings. - for nobody ! I know what it is ! Already ! - I - BILLINGS All I 'm askin ' of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - - ZEPHA ( desperately ) You 're askin ' more than I can give ! I ca n't do it , Mr. Billings ! I could n't go through that again for nobody ! I could n't go through it - for God ! No - I couldn't. p. 107 BILLINGS ( picks up his hat - goes to door - turns ) What 's goin ' to save me now , Zepha ? You gave me a savin ' word once . Can you give me one again ? ZEPHA I guess you got to find it for yourself , Mr. Billings - I - Enter MEADOWS . Billings steps back to let him on . Meadows makes his way to counter . He is shabby - disheveled - drunk .

MEADOWS ( turns to him ) When my wife died this winter - when my boy got killed overseas - I felt it was God 's will - and that God was just . As long as you believe that - you can bear anything . But when you see there is n't any justice anywhere - ( crosses to Zepha ) That 's what you told me . You said it - no justice - you said . - - No justice .

( crosses to Meadows ) Come - ZEPHA You going to send him to that cure place ? BILLINGS No . It ai n't science that does it , Zepha . It did n't do it for me . It was thinkin ' about you - did it - and hopin ' . You got to have hope somehow - a reason for livin ' - something ! and that generally means - somebody . ( to Meadows ) Come along , old friend .
