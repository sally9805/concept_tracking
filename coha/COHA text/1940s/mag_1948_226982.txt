It was a quiet Sunday afternoon in Shreveport , La. , and two schoolboys ( 9 and 11 ) were playing cowboys &; Indians in the schoolyard . One of them slung a rock-and accidentally broke a window . That set them off . With a whoop , they threw rocks and more rocks . Great was the slaughter-156 windows-in Alexander School . <P> To mop up the prostrate enemy , they broke into the schoolhouse , whirled through classrooms , smashing pictures , vases , chairs , and lamps . They tipped over bookcases , tore up maps , scattered papers , threw books out the windows . They went to the principal 's office , threw ink over the walls , smashed up a radio , a phonograph and every record in the room . At the end , they went back to a classroom and wrote on a blackboard : " I 'm sorry we had to do it , " and " Too bad-from the people who done it . " <P> In juvenile court last week the boys tried in vain to explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We like the sound of falling glass . "
