EMIL LIERS , of Homer , Minnesota , is a mild , nature-loving , tenderhearted man . He readily admits , however , that there are two ways to make him angry ; one is for men and one for women . To start with the ladies , the crack that deeply penetrates Emil 's skin is when the darlings gush and coo over his utterly charming trained otters and then wind up by fingering their deep , sleek , waterproof coats and remarking , " Boy ! what a neckpiece that would make . " The men , on the other hand , say that otter live on fish . Emil Liers knows that 's a myth . He learned it by living intimately with otter for fourteen years . He 's traced the fallacy as far back as the original writings of Izaak Walton in the seventeenth century . It 's persisted long enough for Minnesota fishing fans , with the help of the State Conservation Department , to have haled Emil into court in the summer of 1939 on charges of letting his pet herd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trout streams . The United States Biological Survey says there are probably fewer than 5000 otter  --  dictionaries okay an s-less plural  --  left in North America , and that 's a lot of territory , for otter range from Florida to the Arctic Circle . In the fourteen years since Emil Liers picked up his first helpless otter cubs after their mother died in one of his own traps , he has passed some ninety otter through his farm to zoos and private collectors wealthy enough to buy and keep this most unusual of field pets . Until Liers taught them how , no other owner or zoo kept these elusive animals alive more than a few months or bred them at all . Liers is the only man in the world to breed otter in captivity , and what 's even more amazing to the Color pholl layman , to train them to be house pets , to retrieve like the best hunting dogs and to do tricks and jobs that no dog can ever do . He has told the greatest names in zoology how to feed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to learn for decades . The personal appearances he has made with his portable tank , snowy-haired Mrs. Liers and the delightful pals , have charmed audiences from the Everglades Club in Palm Beach to the American Museum of Natural History in New York . Charm is really the thing about otter . Sounds like a term more to be applied to a glamour girl . Otter are n't glamorous . They are downright homely if you want to be critically specific . But no one with the slightest spark of that almost universal human sympathy for an appealing beast fails to be entirely captivated by Liers ' otter , once he gets to know them ; a privilege not accorded to many . tufra Cancuiensis is a little shovel-nosed beast , sleekly brown-black and about as big as a largish dachshund . They are web-footed and bottle-brushtailed , fat and squirmy , incredibly graceful in the water , swifter on land than their humpbacked , weasel-like appearance would indicate , and more friendly , playful , man-loving and downright intelligent in both instinct and reasoning power than any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chimps , elephants and most of the other zoologist 's candidates for such intellectual honors . Dog lovers will present a strong argument on this ; they 'll have to see for themselves . Minnesota Mowgli ALONG with these qualities in otter goes a feeling of some awe when in the presence of Emil Liers and his scampering , loyal , almost elfin herd , trailing across the Minnesota fields and marshes , swimming from his rowboat in the Mississippi or taking otter belly-whoppers down the sand dunes on a visit to Daytona Beach . You ca n't help feeling that you are seeing something forbidden , something very special , a Pied Piper sort of character out of Midsummer Night 's Dream who talks animal language and whose mind can reason right along with that of Toquesh , Tarka , Plunky , Tara , Tetawish and the rest of his lithe and fascinating herd . The feeling must be justified , for bear in mind once more that no one else in all the curious world of animal lovers , trainers , scientists and woodsmen has domesticated and bred the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of man devotes itself to the extermination of a useful animal for THE SATURDAY EVENING POST by Ivan Dmitri. which once numbered 600,000 in North America ; an animal which has never shared the protection the Great White Father has given to elk , bison , deer or even ducks . An animal ruthlessly hunted , shot , trapped , torn to bits by specially trained packs of dogs bred for the purpose , and mostly because of the myth that Emil Liers - has now exploded  --  the one about their living on a fish diet . There are certain humans touched with special qualities . The Nature god gave Liers a deeply compassionate trait of almost childish simplicity , of trust in Nature . With it he has the rare power of real communion with wild , live , furry and feathered things . The sort of touch that made John Burroughs and Ernest Thompson Seton the men they were . Without ever going to college , this Minnesota Mowgli has been able to teach the learned professors with the strings of degrees a lot about natural history . Though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd never mistake him for a child , Emil yet possesses the infinite , beyond-understanding patience and tenderness necessary in really great naturalists . To write about the otter , you must write about him , for humanly and scientifically they are inseparable . Emil was the sort of boy who always surrounded himself with pets . His father , a barber of German extraction , alternated barbering with farming all over the Minnesota , Iowa and Wisconsin borders of the Mississippi . Emil was born at Clayton , Iowa . A string of hack-country schools made classes only brief interludes breaking up his self-education in the woods . In the days when the breed of the pioneer was already disappearing from the Midwest and American frontiers had pushed on toward the Pacific , young Emil made a point of learning all the detailed lore of fishing , hunting , trapping , tracking game and living in the wilds . He registered to study forestry at the University of Minnesota , But that fall there came a glorious Indian summer just when Emil was supposed to start studying . Emil postponed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wait in the reeds and watch the ducks and geese honk southward , to lie immobile by a forest pool all day to watch the little beasts at work and play . In his father 's farmyard he kept dogs , cats , ferrets , raccoons , ground hogs , porcupines  --  even skunks . In migration season he run a private hospital fur crippled ducks and other birds . He looks back now on his parents as very tolerant people to have stood for all their son 's animal foolishness and extravagance . Too , he looks back on all the pets of his childhood and joins with Ernest Thompson Seton in nominating the otter as the supreme experience of them all . Seton wrote in his immortal Lives of Game Animals : " It is the otter that stands out pre-eminently as the most beautiful and engaging of all pets . " There 's distinguished support for what Liers has to say of it now . Liers farmed a bit , but pretty early in life turned to making his living from the woods and the live things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and only recently traded off his last 500 live minks to devote his full time to otter . He used to set trap lines for fur animals , necessity hardening his heart to the killing , setting his traps in water , where a captive beast would quickly drown and not suffer long in the cruel steel device . Today his massive jaw sets belligerently as he expresses an almost religious hope that trapping will ? Continued on Page 74 ) " No . No , " she said faintly to Sugarfoot . He did not hear her . " The lady is waiting , " said Sugarfoot . The stranger mouthed through split and bleeding lips . He mumbled indistinctly as he sought for the sort of words that would satisfy Sugarfoot . " Speak up , " said the young man . " Ma'am , I 'm shore a skunk . Ma'am , I 'm shore a skunk ' n ' a polecat , " said the stranger . " Miss Cairn is satisfied , " Sugarfoot said . He stepped over the stranger 's body , took Reva @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was silent , shaken . " Oh , my dear , " she said . He made no reply , but only breathed deeply , and expression be forever outlawed , along with such barbarous relics as dog fighting , the beating of horses and organized fox hunting . Fourteen years ago , in the dead of winter , Liers went over his trap line near Grand Marais , Minnesota . In one underwater trap he found a dead female otter , mercifully drowned  --  a pelt worth some eighty dollars to the trapper . As he turned to carry off his catch he heard a plaintive chittering in the icy mud along the stream bank . There were two tiny lost cubs , starved and cold , knowing nothing better to do than to stay near their mother 's body . Seeing their mother stiff and dead , they raised enough courage to speak . Liers bundled the tiny , bedraggled babies under his coat and hurried home . There , his twelve-year-old daughter , Patricia , warmed the orphans in a box in the kitchen and fed them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the babies  --  two females  --  reciprocated with warm , snuggling affection . Emil never set another trap . He can bring tears to a listener 's eyes today by describing a trapped animal 's sufferings . He has had one otter whose front paw rotted away from injuries in another trapper 's snare , and Tony , a belligerent and happy buck otter , now in the Liers herd , gets special attention because he lost a toe in a similar experience . Liers is no missionary , but he 'll do what he can to stop trapping . They named the cubs Toquesh and Nashtash  --  most of them have Ojibway or other Indian names ; these mean Good and Bad Girl  --  and made them honored guests . They begged for table scraps while the family ate , and when they grew too old to be interested any longer in milk , Liers fed them pretty much what the family ate themselves . The animals prospered physically , and that gave Emil the clue to the idea that the reason most otter died in captivity was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States Fish and Wildlife Service put out a bulletin listing among other misinformation that " a reliable source of fresh fish . . . is essential to success in raising otters . " Emil laughs at this and inquires : " Why do n't they ask me ? I 'll be glad to give them my balanced-ration formula . " By following a natural understanding of nutrition and asking local doctors to clear up obscure points , Emil has created a balanced ration including horse meat , bone meal , rolled oats , wheat-germ meal , alfalfa meal , whole milk , orange or tomato juice , yeast and cod-liver oil  --  all in proporcame back to his face , so that he looked again like a young man and not like an automaton . " I was afraid of you . " " You never need be afraid of me , " he said gently . " Never . " " You were so  --  so ruthless . " " I did what required to be done , " he said simply . And then , his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . I remember . He wore a wide-awake hat . He sat at a table with Jacob Stint in a Tucson wine shop . " He paused and stared at her without seeing her . " He is here , in Prescott . Here . And the Army paymaster comes to Fort Whipple the day after tomorrow . " ( TO DE CONTINUED ) tions he is willing to tell to some and sell to others , depending on the validity of their interest in otter . By the time the cubs were a year old , and confounding all the local prophets by waxing fatter and stronger than ever , Liers began to hope he could get them mates and make history by actually breeding otter . Over the backwoods grapevine he passed the word to trappers and farmers that he would pay well for live male otter . It was almost another year before two bucks were captured and brought to Homer , and a disappointing third year dragged by with Toquesh and Nashtash and the newcomers showing little romantic interest in one another . The arrival of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a few days of nesting activity by the mother . Liers was jubilant and named the cub , fittingly , Eureka . He had learned important facts that have stood up ever since : that otter do not breed till male and female are three or more years old ; that they breed only in a short period in midwinter . The period of gestation was a secret until 1941 . Now Emil has discovered that it is ten months and one week  --  a surprisingly long period for small mammals , which the zoologists thought could produce young in sixty to eighty days . That hard-won fact provided another link in the chain of evidence as to why the otter is on the brink of total extinction . Working back from present knowledge , Emil explains this . The family habits of the otter are partly responsible . If one was trapped , others would come searching loyally back to the same point and suffer a similar fate . Hunters knew this and always replaced an otter trap where the first kill was made . The late maturity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before they could reproduce , and the inherent friendliness of the beasts counted too . Unlike other wild life , the mere presence of man did not frighten them , but the wild otter have , through long and painful years , learned to avoid man . That accounts , according to Liers , for another misconception  --  the one that otter are nocturnal hunters . Those that live at the Liers farm and in zoos soon learn to play and hunt by day and sleep by night , reversing a schedule which , in the wilds , kept them out of hunters ' sight . " How 's that for intelligence ? " asks Emil . " The dog has been in captivity for thousands of years and does n't yet know much more than man has taught him . " In only fourteen years otter have learned one important thing about life in civilization ; that 's faster than many a human learns . After the birth of Eureka , breeding proceeded more rapidly , with Emil patiently spending all his days and many nights with his growing herd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adult otter from trappers , found them almost instantly adaptable to farm life and learned of the development of the cubs ' mental and physical capacities . Unlike other aquatic mammals , otter cubs can not swim at birth . They are blind until their fifth week , playing around their protective mother in the warm sun , sleeping with her in a den while papa leaves home to make more room , returning a few times a day with contributions of food for his family . At three months the mother first takes her cubs to the water , orders them into the new element , usually against their will , and makes them swim and bunt for themselves , proudly watching from a stream bank and dashing to a quick , nape-of-the-neck rescue if a baby gets in trouble . Tara had three cubs at the Liers farm , and Lively Lady surprised Liers as well as the public by producing unexpected quadruplets while on exhibition at the Northwest Sportsmen 's Show at Minneapolis . Mostly , just one or two at a time are the normal family . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a prodigious amount of exercise to remain healthy . No dog , however large , requires the amount of running , swimming and romping his otter get every day in the Minnesota woods . For hours at a time Liers rambles over fields and mountains and along stream banks while his furry entourage have the time of their lives , swimming , diving , racing , bellywhopping down muddy banks , playing tag with Liers ' dogs  --  an Airedale , golden retrievers , a Sealyham , a fox terrier and an Irish water spaniel are included in the present canine staff ? and generally whooping it up till Emil blows his policeman 's whistle for the bunch to start home . All the while Liers keeps up a running fire of conversation with his charges . A cry of " Here , otties ! " or a short toot on the whistle brings laggards bounding in from a last search for an elusive crawfish under a creek bank . Happy Hunting Ground It 's a little eerie to sit with Liers over a deep forest pool and have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over a whitish shirtwaist poked from the water two feet away to chitter back to the man 's amiable " Hello , Tetawish ; go play with Jocko now . " An answering chirp , a porpoiselike dive and only an occasional bubble reveal Tetawish 's underwater whereabouts . Liers , who would be the first to maintain that all Chinese look alike , can instantly identify and call by name any otter in his herd . If the weather is warm , Emil lets the otter exhaust themselves in the water while he dreams or reads under a tree . One after another , the happy gang emerge from the stream , roll in grass or sand to dry their delightfully deep , thick fur , and negotiate for cuddling space as close to their master as possible for a brief snooze before more romping . Sometimes one will proudly bear a captured frog or crawfish to Liers and offer to share it . Other practical jokers will pick up a carelessly dropped glove or cap and impishly rush into the water with it , worrying it M sight of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ! " makes the otter bring back the booty , drop it at Emil 's feet and promptly roll over on his back for the master 's approving scratch or reprimanding slap . No repentant spaniel puppy was ever more disarming than an otter fearing reproof for a breach of etiquette and begging forgiveness . Moving Evidence Liers shakes his head sadly over the unthinking hostility of humans toward animals . It was probably the sight of a few forest scenes like the one just described that led some fishermen to ask the Minnesota Conservation Depat tuient to arrest Liers and charge him with " raising and propagating otter along certain streams and rivers , " permitting them to eat fish and generally misbehave legally . Liers fought the charges , and now it is formally entered on the court record and inscribed in an official state document that Liers ' otter may be exercised and swim in the majority of the streams in the vicinity where he lives . Liers showed the court the movie made by the Field Museum , of Chicago , to record the natural history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no attention to plentiful trout in the streams , devoting their hunting to the capture of crawfish , frogs , snakes , snails and other natural enemies of fish . The case cost Emil a lot of money and trouble . He writes it off now with a remark about the prophet being without honor in his own country . Zoos and state game preserves all over the country are begging him to bring his otter to them for exercise , exhibition and study . One time , in winter , Carmencita , particular pet of Mrs. Liers , dropped far behind while Emil and the rest were on their way home . A near-by farmer , seeing her at the water 's edge , seized his timber ax and slaughtered the friendly beast , which made no attempt to escape . Liers is a SeventhDay Adventist and slow to wrath " But there was real murder in my heart then , " he relates . Fish nets stretched across streams are another menace and have drowned an otter more than once . Their unique six-lobed lungs enable them to stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three miles or more under ice by utilizing trapped air bubbles under the surface , but there 's a limit to everything . Toquesh , one of the first of Liers ' otter , is still in the family . She 's an honored matriarch today and proud of her position in the community . She has one failing that should please some humans . A frightened lady visitor who thought the otter 's affectionate rub on her ankle was an attempted attack screamed loudly and kicked Toquesh . Ever since , although as gentle as any of the others , she will nip any woman ? not man  --  who makes more noise than she thinks seemly ; just enough to remind them to behave themselves . Every one of the Liers herd has a personality of its own , and it does not take even a visitor long to see these characteristics . Toquesh is always hopeful of an extra run and will chatter and squeal as if in pain , in hopes that the boss will let her out of the cage for an extracurricular romp . Tarka @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard , begs to be allowed in the house , where she climbs on the Lierses ' bed , pillowing her head on Mrs. Liers ' shoulder for comfort all through the night . When Emil threatened Jimbo with a switch for not coming home when called , his mate , Jocko , difficulty would never have arisen . That was my fault  --  I assumed that your lordship knew . " " Knew ? " said the bishop . " What should I know of such things ? And yet , God forgive me , I am a priest and I should have knowledge of evil . " " It is merely a difference in knowledge , " said Luigi gently . " Now , your lordship , doubtless , has never been in a room quite like this before . " The bishop stared at the damp walls and the mean chamber . He smelled the smell that can not be aired from a room , the smell of poverty itself . He had never doubted his own experience before  --  when he had been first made a priest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now it seemed to him that those works must have been rather carefully selected . " No , " he said , " I have never been in a room just like this one . " " And yet there are many of us who live in such rooms  --  and not all beggars , " said Luigi . He changed his tone . " That was a. fine rousing sermon your lordship gave us on idleness and heedlessness this morning , " he said . " Hey , it brought the scudi forth from
