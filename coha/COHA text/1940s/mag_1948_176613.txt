Eighteen months ago , before squaring off against world illiteracy on a broad scale , U.N . ' s Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization ( UNESCO ) decided to try a small-scale test of its methods in Haiti 's remote Marbial Valley , where illiteracy was the rule .

Last week it dispatched a 12-man survey mission to Port-au-Prince . Assignment : to advise the Haitian government on all the island 's problems , including illiteracy .
