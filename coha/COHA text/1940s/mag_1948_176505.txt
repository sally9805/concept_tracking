NATHANIEL HAWTHORNE : THE AMERICAN YEARS ( 499 pp. ) - Robert Cantwell - Rinehart ( $6 ) . <P> <P> For the first time since Henry James put his hand to it , in 1879 , the task of writing Hawthorne 's biography has been undertaken by a born novelist of distinction . James wrote in England , in all the panoply of his handsome prose , and with a good deal of Old World " side " ; but he did not have much to add to the story of Hawthorne 's life . He knew it , and called his book a " critical essay . " <P> Robert Cant well 's portrayal of Hawthorne is superior to James 's in warmth and scope ; it is free of James 's overtones of worldly condescension ; and whatever it may lack of James 's awesome artistic judgment it makes up for in freshness , and in the imaginative grasp of a real man 's life and character . After Cantwell 's work , the image that Americans have had of Hawthorne will never be quite the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Lie Down and Land of Plenty , were recognized as remarkably gifted in the early ' 30s and remain among the few novels of the depression still worth reading . He joined the staff of TIME in 1935 , and began his researches in Hawthorne in 1939 when , at the beginning of the war in Europe , he picked up Hawthorne 's Our Old Home and reread it " with a sense of wonder . . . at the close application of his insights " into England . The present book ( the first volume of two ) ends with the fame and . security that came to Hawthorne in 1850 , when he was 45 , on the publication of The Scarlet Letter . <P> " The American Years " were those in which , in the accepted version , Hawthorne 's life was most shadowy-when he " lived in seclusion ... in his town of Salem , a seclusion certainly grave , if not morbid , obsessed with the Puritan sense of guilt and haunted by a family curse , writing his wonderful stories that no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Custom House to provide for his family , and emerging in his early middle age ... to take part in a contemporary world he had scarcely known existed . " Says Robert Cantwell : " Such a portrait , with its angular shadows , its El Greco distortions . . . is in itself an interesting product of the American imagination ... but I found it less and less like Hawthorne the more I learned of him . " <P> <P> The Gift &; the Burden . Out of a thorough steeping in Hawthorne 's Notebooks and in his journalistic work , which James and many others have loftily disregarded or deplored , and in family records and diaries never touched before , Cantwell has retouched that portrait . These sources have enabled Cantwell to take his subject out of the shadows , to estimate sensitively the influences that formed him , and to recreate the New England life about him .
